B006L9B6TI|5.0|Love this book!! It is so clear and it is the fastest way to obtain a better life! Appreciation is the key!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it is incredibly well written.  As a dystopian novel I feel it is more relatable than 1984 or Brave New World, without being preachy.  The fact that you can see so much of our own current society reflected in the \\"capital,\\" such as Reality TV and surgical elective enhancement, with a broad smattering of Roman society for flavor and this trilogy emerges as both engaging and educating.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book for 7th grade and up, although it might be a little dark for younger audiences.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are addicting!!! a must buy for bored nights. fun times for whole family. you should down load and try
B0071PS7AC|2.0|This game is so slow and boring, and controlling the balls is impossible. A total waste, even if it's free for a day.

B000FC1JCQ|5.0|A beautifully written story from the female point of view in the Arthurian period. I was captivated from the first page as  author wrote in a superb, beautiful, and mesmerizing style. One of the best depth of characters that I have read, ever. I couldn't stop reading this book, and at the same time I hated for it to end.<br /><br />This is a 5+ star book. One of the best books ever written. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i got this game for my 5 yr old who can never play a game for more then 10 mins. this game keeps him entertained for hours.
B003L77GRO|4.0|Although I rated this season \\"4 Stars\\" due to how much I love the character Dexter Morgan, there were some flaws I feel that need to be pointed out.<br /><br />The main protagonist/s were a bit lacking this season. The thrill factor was just not there, IMO. I guess I was spoiled having the great John Lithgow guest starring last season.<br /><br />I am getting sick of Deb Morgan's potty mouth. Every time she is on screen you can expect her to use the \\"F\\" word at LEAST once. It adds absolutely nothing to the quality of the writing of the show! Her bad-ass-butch-cop image is uber-hokey. Please let her die soon! It would make a great storyline!<br /><br />The season finale has so many holes in it. It seemed very rushed and Twilight Zone impossible. The scene with Dexter, Lumen, and Deb at the end was not well done in the least bit.<br /><br />Otherwise, I love it and look forward to (hopefully a better) season 6.<br /><br />Comments are welcome! Love you all...
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I use this amp to drive a Sennheiser HD598 from my iPod. My music ranges from Jethro Tull, through Mary Carpenter and on to East Indian classical. Although the headphones have a low resistance, and an iPod should be able to drive them, the difference with this amp is amazing. The sound quality goes beyond the increased bass that is typically reported in the Amazon.com reviews I read. Music seems to take on a whole lot more \\"body\\" (you can tell I am not a techno-audiophile). The stage presence that a good headphone is capable of is fully utilized by using a good quality amp and, for me, this one is it.<br /><br />The combination of portability, cost and performance make this unit a hard-to-beat for me.
006197806X|3.0|Delirium was my favorite YA book of 2011. In fact, even after receiving an ARC copy, I went out and bought another copy so that I could have it in hardcover as well. This may be why I did not like Pandemonium-- because I had pretty stellar high expectations. Although the resistance is an interesting story line in theory, I found it to be pretty boring. Instead of Lena being a strong heroine, like I saw her finally become in Delirium with planning to run away, she spent a good portion of the book being held prisoner and simply hanging out with Julian. If Oliver was going to do a resistance book, it should have been like The Hunger Games where I was on the edge of seat wanting to know how it would end. I tried to like Julian because his back story was interesting, but I did not connect with him like I would have liked, and sometimes their relationship seemed forced. Even worse than not connecting with the characters, the \\"then\\" chapters were the worst part of the book and I found myself skimming through those chapters. But since I loved Delirium and since the most interesting part of the book happened on the last page I will happily pick up the 3rd to see how it ends.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|i am using it on a Kindle Fire. I like the graphics, sound, and simulation of throwing a hook ball. Once you figure out the spot to release for a hook, it's very easy to roll a strike. Strikes are more consistent if you throw a hook vs. a straight ball. Picking up spares is too easy because the straight balls are too easy to line up and throw. It's a good time killer. I hope future versions will add more features to the very good basic simulation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really cool app! I love it! Great way to pass the time on a cold rainy day. Games are addicting.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|This is a pretty decent bowling game, sure it needs work but its not bad. To those complaining about bad controls read the help its not hard to play. Its also not impossible to beat the computer, I was able to beat them all with no problem, beating the last one 279 to 198. Give it a chance it may not be flashy but it does what it says it is.

B0071PS7AC|3.0|This is a very simple game. Wish it had more to it. I would not have paid $.99 for it so its a good thing its free today. I will most likely delete it within the week due to the lack of options.

B0006AAS5G|3.0|Keeps excellent time, weight and feel are significant for $80 but its chronograph function does not work, otherwise a good timepiece. >>> A previous review comparing movements in the \\"old\\" versus this \\"new\\" 9211 model, about the change to a non-working chronograph movement, is accurate and informative. The stock photo published on Amazon (as of 3/6/12) depicts the \\"old\\" 9211 face. In the new model, there are no markers at 3 and 9 as sub-dial design trumps functionality. An Invicta rep commented that the new 9211 is a design-driven model that required movement modifications targeted to appeal to a larger market.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|I thought the idea of a silent film in this day and age, shot in 4 x 3 or 1.33 to 1 ratio, was one of the dumbest money wasting ideas I had ever heard.  Then I started reading the reviews and decided I must see it for myself.<br /><br />Please read C. Sawin's amazon review.  It explains all.  I can only add that I saw the movie at a theater FEB 6, 2012.  I can't stop thinking about the movie and I can hear dialogue in my mind.  That's how good the acting was.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this movie will go down as the best directed, acted, and edited in the history of film.  In addition, it has a beautiful score that John Williams or any of the other greats would be proud of.<br /><br />I saw the movie again yesterday (3/6/2012) and interviewed many members of the audience as we left the theater.  They all agreed with me that \\"The Artist\\" is engrossing and wonderful.  I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what the ending was going to be, even though I knew the ending.<br /><br />I have pre-ordered on DVD and will watch it as many times as possibly.
1400069289|5.0|I looooved this book! If you want to discover the power behind habits and the secrets to changing them, this is something you won't be able to put down. It's a real page turner because the author gets your attention with a powerful story, ending with a cliffhanger while he weaves in another captivating story, then goes back to the original, etc.<br /><br />I used to feel disdain for Starbuck's for weeding out so many mom `n' pop coffee shops, but now I have a greater respect for them as I learned how they took kids with no discipline, even high school dropouts,  and taught them to become successful managers. I was amazed to learn how Michael Phelps set a world record in the swimming Olympics even though his goggles got messed up and he couldn't see! A football team that hadn't won a game in over a decade went on to become a star.<br /><br />This book is empowered with many more real life examples demonstrating the power behind habits, including a man who accidentally killed his wife and a woman who lost her one million dollar inheritance from a gambling habit. (Habits are compared to addictions in this book.)<br /><br />The power of goal setting by simply writing things down is demonstrated. Also, we learn in this book how simple it is to change a habit: keep the same cue of a previous habit, followed by a different routine (habit), followed by the same reward of the habit you wish to change.<br /><br />We also learn how companies like Target use statistics to learn our shopping habits--and I was surprised to learn that coupons sent to us in the mail are all personalized! In one funny story, a man complained to Target that his young daughter was being sent coupons for baby items. \\"Are you trying to ENCOURAGE her to get pregnant?\\" He later apologized: she was indeed pregnant. If a company can get the business of a pregnant woman, they strike gold. I was also flabbergasted to learn how much the radio manipulates us. I am glad I quit listening to it 20 years ago! Sadly, no one manipulates people more than casinos do--their behavior should be illegal, in my opinion.<br /><br />The author feels that \\"... once you know a habit exists, you have the responsibility to change it\\" and \\"... once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom--and the responsibility -to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, that power becomes easier to grasp, and the only option that remains is to get to work.\\"<br /><br />The author concludes with the story of how the famous psychologist William James rose to success by simply changing habits. \\"Habits, he noted, are what allow us to `do a thing with difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all.'\\"<br /><br />Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & Planet<br />and<br />Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't Work, no one manipulates people more than casinos do--their behavior should be illegal, in my opinion.<br /><br />The author feels that \\"... once you know a habit exists, you have the responsibility to change it\\" and \\"... once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom--and the responsibility -to remake them.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is everything a game should be...intriguing, smooth, addictive, relaxing, stimulating - this game just hits all the right notes.  Whether your seriously into games (like my boyfriend) or more like me where you use your device primarily for reading (I have the kindle fire) more than gaming, you'll love Quell.  It's practically perfect - simple concept, executed beautifully, no glitches, nice graphics with wonderful details, soothing music...I wish there were more games like Quell! It's definitely a favorite!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I do not leave comments on most apps but this one is getting the stuffen kicked out of it. After playing a while and learning the controls I have to say it does better and tries harder to model putting a spin on the ball then other bowling games I have tried, even Doodle bowling. It even models getting a split better. Other bowling apps rarely do this when it is clear that you hit the pins dead on. It does misread my strokes sometimes. This seems to be happening less with practice. I have 4 bowling games. I like them all for different reasons. ---Harry

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoed the whole series. There were only two real complaints. The stories were told in such detail but the end of the story was just kind of thrown out there and it felt a little weird the way that it ended with the two love intrests in the story. I cant wait to see the movie(s).
B000X4GXT0|5.0|My favorite play by The Bard, Olivia Hussey is a beautiful Juliet.  She comes across so innocent and demure that you can't help but love her.

Stick with this beautiful tale of love and tragedy, you won't be sorry

006197806X|5.0|Wow! I'm seriously at a loss for words on how to describe Pandemonium in three words or less and all I can come up with is WOW. This sequel is awesome! Lauren's writing never ceases to amaze me, and she really blew me away with what she does in Pandemonium. Similar to what she does in Delirium, she goes against the norm and what I expected and pulls me into an ever more surprising world. Pandemonium introduces readers to new emotions, a slightly different world, new characters, a stronger Lena who's defiance and inner strength blew me away, and well balanced look at what shaped Lena into the person she becomes in this absolutely brilliant sequel!<br /><br />Lena herself really surprised me in this sequel and I have to say this girl has courage and a will to survive that shocked me. I loved the way Lauren allowed me as a reader to see why she changed so much. It's not just her grieving heart for Alex that changed her, but the world she's now apart of. An equally dangerous place where your former self can't exist. I completely understood the anger, hate, courage, drive and defiance that replaces her more former innocent self. Together these things drive Lena to action and to do the things she does in this book. I felt like I was able to understand the emotions Lena felt through out the course of her story, and they're definitely justified by what she deals with.<br /><br />I loved the unique way in which Lauren tells this story. Each chapter alternates from \\"Then\\" or from \\"Now\\", which allows Lauren to take readers further into her well structured, fast plowing story line. In doing so, readers get to see how \\"the Wild\\" and now Lena's new society have shaped her. This worked perfect for this story, and I didn't find it confusing at all. Seriously, this story line was nothing at all what I was excepting it to be. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. Lauren Oliver's writing in this series has really blown me away. She strips you of everything you knew from Delirium and throws you into a whole new world with even greater danger, a bit more action, romance, twists and a book that's filled with defiance, change and some surprising secrets.<br /><br />If you loved Delirium wait till you pick up Pandemonium. This title lives up to it's name in this book, and the things that happen will shock you! I loved the new characters that Lauren introduces into the story series and the turn of events that happen. For the sake of no spoilers I'm not going to mention of any of them, because some things will seriously surprise you! I won't even mention that killer of a cliff hanger. Requiem's release date can't get her fast enough! I have a feeling things are going to get a lot more interesting in that book. There is some very mild language in this book.irium and throws you into a whole new world with even greater danger, a bit more action, romance, twists and a book that's filled with defiance, change and some surprising secrets.<br /><br />If you loved Delirium wait till you pick up Pandemonium.

Set opposite the year 1984, the world explores a world filled with fantastical characters brought to life.

1416550550|4.0|This was the first Kate Morton book I've read. I love finding new authors that I enjoy, it always helps with my search for the next book I want to read. The Forgotten Garden was beautifully written, with interweaving stories pulling you into in an empathic relationship with most of the diverse characters. Even when the plot became somewhat predictable, a point where I often speed read a novel to the end, I found the pace enjoyable, and the writing of a style which did not rush the ending. The story in this book breathes melancholy through each chapter, but accomplishes a hopeful rather than a sad ending.
B00005JPGO|3.0|Last night's bargain rack DVD for late night viewing was \\"Blood Diamond.\\" I'd never heard of the movie but I bought it because it had a banner on the front that said it had five academy award nominations. I figured that it must be a good movie. Well, I can understand the nominations as it was very well done in a variety of ways.<br /><br />I didn't care for \\"Blood Diamond\\" and I'd advise people against watching it unless they have a high tolerance for extreme violence. Actually, I have nothing particularly against violence in films and I see a lot of it in action movies and the like which are more like cartoons than the real thing. But the violence in this film was from beginning to end and involved everyone including hapless women and children. This wasn't a fantasy cartoon. This was the real thing and my heart went out to the people of Sierra Leone and other places like it. Extreme brutality was everywhere. I have no idea what the body count of the dead and wounded might have been but I'd guess it was in the thousands, Did I mention the torture, personal degradation and the destruction of property? Death, destruction and mayhem were just an ongoing and integral part of the entire movie, and it had a point in that the control of diamond mining in a country undergoing civil strife was involved. Greed seemed to be the dominant emotion everywhere.<br /><br />The acting was quite good. The people, even the minor bit players, seemed real, unfortunately. The cinema was excellent and it was very interesting to see this part of Africa, except for the extreme ongoing violence. The movie was nicely paced and flowed along without any dull spots. I thought the story was contrived to make a bold statement against diamond mining, diamond smuggling and the diamond industry, in general. Well, I've never been a friend of the highly controlled diamond industry so it was good to see them take a little heat. They earned it. But to me, the total effect of the movie was negative. I ended up feeling as if I had watched a very well done and sophisticated piece of propaganda. When I see a good movie, I sometimes mull over it for the next few days. In this case, I find myself trying to get it out of my mind.<br /><br />Gary Petersond up feeling as if I had watched a very well done and sophisticated piece of propaganda.

055338466X|2.0|In Hawking's and Mlodinow's pop-science book \\"The Grand Design\\" it is an attempt to explain how the universe began, why we are here, etc. It is written on the high school level. Instead of concentrating on classical versus quantum physics and cosmology they spend far to much time trying to disprove the existence of God,using the above mentioned disciplines, which I might add, was done in a very sloppy and inaccurate manner. It is very evident that these physicists have had no training in theology whatsoever or have not researched sources involving \\"science versus religion\\". The big picture their missing is science is based on the \\"scientific method\\" whereas religion is based on faith. The religious scriptures are clearly not to be science textbooks;the scientific events listed,in these religious writings,are simply how the people of the time explained their world at that point in time. There are far more valuable lessons to be learned from these religious writings (i.e Bible and or Koran) then looking for statements that science has proven wrong. Let's leave classical and quantum physics to the physicist and religion to the theologians. There are far better books out their that discuss \\"science and religion\\" as well as the relationship involving classical physics and quantum mechanics. Don't waste your time checking it out let alone buying it. Total waste of money. A fast food meal would be money better spent.

1451648537|1.0|How are people giving this book such a high rating? Probably people who haven't read much about Jobs. Over half of this book is filled with information that has already been widely published: it's nothing new. After reading the entire book, I learned very little new information about Steve Jobs. Yet, Walt did 40 interviews with the man. The excerpts of recordings the author played in interviews was compelling. Yet, that stuff isn't really present in this book. It's a messy, confused mash up of quotes from other books, the Web, and magazines. And the Bibliography doesn't seem to cite these sources fully.<br /><br />To me, this book is a ripoff of other people's content.<br /><br />Organization<br /><br />The book is also poorly organized and repetitive. It'll focus on some aspect of a period of time. And then, another chapter will present itself, and pan back and focus on yet another story. It gets confusing. It's not seamless and linear at all. It's overall... very confusing.<br /><br />What's missing?<br /><br />A lot. I personally know a lot of inside info on Apple. The book really misses here. It simply glosses over stuff that so many people already know about.<br /><br />The author/publisher... it's clear from this stuff that they rushed it to market to profit off of his death. Don't support this. Don't spend your money on this. Don't support the publisher. They had a chance to really reveal the man Steve Jobs. The book fails in every respect. It's confusing, disjointed, poorly written, two dimensional, and shallow.
0061122416|4.0|In Paulo Coelho's short story, \\"The Alchemist\\", an archetypal journey encompasses the reader with the concepts of simplicity, love, fear, and treasure.  Santiago, the main character of the story, travels through various settings to achieve his personal legend, a common theme presented throughout the text.<br /><br /> Santiago is a young Sheppard when readers first meet him.  With a passion for traveling and understanding the simple yet earnest lessons in life, he protects his sheep just as they protect him.  Life seems to be pretty grand for the young lad, yet one night he has a dream that changes his life forever.  Nonetheless, one day, he travels to a small town and unexpectedly meets a heroin figure.  From their conversation, both Santiago and readers of the story learn of several conceptual life-meanings, some being the `soul of the world' and one's `personal legend.'  Perhaps this is the turning point of the story because everything after their meeting deals with fulfilling Santiago's personal legend--finding treasure.<br /><br /> Interestingly, the story is divided into two parts.  There are many distinctions between the two, with the first being the plot.  In part one, readers learn and grow fond of Santiago as bits and pieces of his life are extracted from the text.  In addition, he lives the simple life and showcases an ideal world in which fear is mostly non-existent.  Yet in part two, the name Santiago is never mentioned. He is then referred to as \\"the boy,\\" (81).  This may be to apply the story to not just the young boy, but to any other person.  This quality of the story admits careful planning and depth.  Moreover, the second section of the story deals with Santiago's dream of fulfilling his personal legend.  It could be stated that part one of the book lays the foundation for the rest of the story.<br /><br /> Secondly, the story plays with the concept of love.  In the modern world of today, love is sensationalized as something required to be happy.Yet in the past, it was sometimes quite the opposite.  Nonetheless, a common theme regarding love is the fact that at times, it can be immobilizing. At points in the story, Santiago is faced with the dilemma of following his personal legend or finding love, following motives or one's heart. This is especially true when on his journey, he finds a young woman whom he asks to marry.  Seeing this as a potential hazard to his life destiny, he is faced with either leaving her for treasure or staying, perhaps forever questioning his motives.  Coelho adds to the dilemma mentioning, \\"Wherever your heart is, that is where you'll find your treasure,\\" thus showing such decisions are quite hard to make (128).  This theme is interesting because it can relate to readers who have dealt with similar situations.  While love is not the only theme pronounced in the text, it is one of many to which readers across the world can relate.<br /><br /> Finally, the story ends without leaving any gaps.  While the climax of the story provides more action than nearly the whole story in itself, it is expectedly archetypal and heroic.  The climax may actually turn some readers off--perhaps because it is seemingly unrealistic, unlike the rest of the story--but it is sufficient in surprising the reader.  The rest of the story is fable-like, as Santiago finishes up his journey, but yet again, it is a bit unrealistic.  Even so, it ties in all points or themes revered in prior parts of the story, and leaves readers questioning their own personal motives.

B0071PS7AC|2.0|On the bright side, the graphics are OK, but that is where the positives end. The controls are awkward and the presentation is boring. Save the space on your phone for something better.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|I actually gave the film one star because the major fight scene near the end did involve some entertaining CGI. However, as for the rest of the film I would warn you to not waste your money. The movie seems to be pointless dribble spaced between several fight scenes. There is no building and expanding of the plot so the viewer is left feeling cold and basically non-invested in the films progress. The characters never develop and remain so one dimensional that if they were to turn sideways one would not be able to see them. in essence it was a gathering of uninteresting characters that lacked any significant background information, a jumpy story line and a few fight sequences of which I only found one actually worth really watching. If you have some money to throw away I would suggest that you find a homeless person to give it to rather than wasting it on this failed attempt at entertainment.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Nobody likes this game, and now I see why!  SO BAD!  Don't bother!  The controls are bad, the graphics are cheesy, and the game us an absolute Easter if space!  booooooooo!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce Springsteen adds another great album to his list with the release of \\"Wrecking Ball\\".  It is primarily a \\"solo\\" effort as many of the E Street Band did not play on it.  However, unlike the other solo efforts this one is the \\"liveliest\\" sounding one.<br /><br />\\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" opens the album and sounds the most like the E Street Band to me.  Even though I like it and it is a rousing opener,  compared to what follows it is not the strongest song on the album.  But a \\"weak\\" song from Springsteen is one that many other would build an album around.<br /><br />\\"Easy Money\\", \\"Death to My Hometown\\", and \\"Shackled and Drawn\\" bring back pleasant memories of the Seeger Sessions days.<br /><br />\\"Jack of All Trades\\" and \\"This Depression\\" are both haunting songs and feature excellent solos by Tom Morello.  I will be curious to see how these will be played out on tour since Morello has a unique style.  However, I can also see Nils Lofgren and/or Springsteen taking on the role.  One need only hear the live versions of \\"Youngstown\\" to envision how Nils would approach it.<br /><br />\\"You've Got It\\" has been cited in other reviews as the weakest song on the album.  \\"Weakest\\" is a relative term when thinking about the Boss, but I enjoy slide guitar so I enjoyed this song a lot.<br /><br />\\"Rocky Ground\\" is the most un-Springsteen like song on the album.  It grew on me with repeated listening and the fact that female voices have a prominent role enhances it IMHO.<br /><br />Two \\"old\\" songs make an appearance.  \\"Wrecking Ball\\" made its debut on the last tour and was written about the tearing down of the old Giants Stadium.  Lyrically, the links is still there, but given the context of the album, it fits in just fine with its spirit of not looking back but looking forward.  The same goes for  \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\".  I loved the live version of this from the \\"Live in NYC\\" album, but this version is superb, especially with its \\"People Get Ready\\" feel.  And it also serves as a last goodbye from Clarence as his solo lifts the song to the heavens.<br /><br />The song that is sticking with me the most so far is the closer \\"We Are Alive\\".  After the sadness in some the songs that came before, this tune ends thing on a hopeful note.  When I heard it the first time, I loved the haunting \\"camp fire\\" feel.  Then the \\"Ring of Fire\\" riff kicked in and I was in heaven.  I can't wait to see this one live as well.<br /><br />The two bonus tracks \\"Swallowed Up\\" and \\"American Land\\" are nice extras.  \\"Swallowed Up\\" definitely has the \\"Devils and Dust\\" vibe, which will be fine for some listeners and not so much for others.  \\"American Land\\" is rousing \\"closer\\".<br /><br />While his past solo efforts have been low key compared to his work with the full E Street band, this one rocks from beginning to end, often in ways that he not done so before.  I cannot wait to hear how they sound on tour with the power of the E Street Band.  Based on what I saw on the Jimmy Fallon show last week, Clarence (and Danny) are gone and will be missed but the band is rocking as well as ever and that is the best tribute!<br /><br />There have been critical comments about the validity of a rich man commenting on the plight of those less fortunate. Springsteen has always written about that and does it with insight and passion. The fact that he can still do it now is something to be lauded not regarded with cynicism.<br /><br />Those fans that prefer the \\"classic\\" sound and don't like their idol trying something new can enjoy his older stuff. But they are missing out if they dismiss what Springsteen is doing now. Unlike many other rockers his age who are still out there with nothing new to say and raking it in playing their old hits, Springsteen s always trying new ways to say things.  While he may not always succeed as much as fans would like, I hope he never changes!

B005TBN3EU|3.0|If you liked the first movie, you'll like this one, just don't expect it to be better. It's a sequel so keep your expectations in check.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />There are some good jokes and the interaction between the guys is still hilarious. There is great chemistry with these guys and it delivers in this movie too.<br /><br />More than once it had me laughing loudly. It does have some really great moments, and a couple of shockers.<br /><br />Chow steals the show in this one I think, and giving him more time was definitely worth it.<br /><br />Another song from Ed Helms that is hilarious.<br /><br />You get to see the story continue for the guys.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />It's a sequel so you can't avoid the constant comparisons in your mind.<br /><br />Its a repeat of the formula almost exactly (though most of us expected that).<br /><br />The ending was crap.<br /><br />The jokes were re-used, sometimes the EXACT joke was re-used as if we wouldn't remember it.<br /><br />Mike Tyson's acting doesn't get any better, he's a distraction and kind of annoying.<br /><br />In short, see it, just don't set your expectations too high.

B000001F7R|4.0|Like many people, my 1st Def Leppard album (Yes, album) was Pyromania.  I loved it so much that I just had to hear more from this exciting new band.  So, I bought this album and found a much more Raw sound that I liked even better than Pyromania!<br /><br />Some years went by and much of my record collection got lost.  So, I was excited to get this again.<br /><br />Well, I didn't love it as much as I used to.  But, I think that's mostly a function of being a lot older.  Somehow, a lot of stuff just doesn't seem as AWESOME as it used to.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong tho', this still rocks.  It's still worth the money.  And, if I were a classic rock DJ, \\"Rocks Off\\" would definitely be on my deep cuts rotation.

B00009R86L|5.0|Most of the places I've worked issue Dell laptops for use along with Dell cases.  I cannot stand those standard shoulder pads.  They always slip off and you get aches from trying to stop the slip.<br />These shoulder pads are comfortable and do not slip.  You can use a more relaxed posture so no more aches.  The rubber pad grips so well that it's hard to get your bag off from your shoulder sometimes.  But that is much better than constant slipping.  They are easy to put on and seem to be well built and durable.  I highly recommend these shoulder pads to anyone looking for replacement pads.

0307949486|5.0|I read reviews on this book. The most popular reviews seem to steer toward two extremes, the five stars and one stars. The one-star givers' major complain is that they \\"don't get\\" the book.<br /><br />This book is not an easy read, and can be understandably hard to stomach for those who are not familiar with sadistic violence or sexual assault. Since I live in America, I have to point out that this book is wrongly seen as an insult to those who, like ostriches that bury their heads in the ground - can't deal with the fact that sadistic violence, sexual assault of children happen so often in America. Just look at the sexual crimes committed over the decades in Catholic Church, the Latter Day Saints, the prostitue sector in San Francisco, and among the lesser eye-catchy individuals - Penn State Scandal for example, and you will find plenty of evidence.<br /><br />Since I live in America, I have to point out there is a large difference in cultural attitude between Swedish and Americans on how one goes about his/her sex life. Among those who think that since this book describes misogyny, it must supports misogyny, are practitioners of not-illegal sex habits that if are used against these people in Singapore, they will get punished by Singapore law. It is stupid to criticize the book's depiction of sex when your supposedly more innocent sex habits can get you whipped in a different culture.
1451648537|5.0|very inspiration book,<br />I thought the book covered the essence of entrepreneurial success and mindset. No other book goes quite deep into the psychology of entrepreneurial psychology.<br />I would recommend it to everyone.<br />The book is also a good read for the Jobs and Apple fans and a source of history of the age.

I've read many books about the problem and meaning of suffering, and this is by far the best. Whenever someone I know is going through grief or other discouraging circumstances and wondering what's the use, Frankl's is the book I recommend.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game. keeps you wanting more. loads of fun. makes u plan. fun for everyone. family fun. cant wait to expand restaurant each time played. not sure what else i can say positive about app. daughter trys to take kindle away so she can play.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This was kind of a neat game.  You can't do it without the \\"hints\\" though.  It was well lit, however, I was always getting lost.  I knew where I wanted to go, but there are so many different paths, that I kept having to back my way out and start over again.  I guess that was part of the game though.  The only thing about it was that there was absolutely no way you can do it without using the hints.  Still a fun game.

B0071PS7AC|4.0|I'm not sure if the bad reviewers have cell phones but this game works perfectly fine on my Kindle Fire! I actually read the directions and found it easy to curve. You can choose to bowl against opponents, Lisa, Tommy, Beth and Doc. Lisa is the easiest opponent. I would like to see more tweaked but I have no problems with it. Simply pull back and let go to bowl or pull back harder to bowl faster. I finally got strikes by making the ball SPIN. To make it spin, simply move the ball all the way to the left or right, wait til it starts spinning then move it back to wherever you want to aim and let go. Pick New game to get the harder opponents choices. This is a pretty good game for Free
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We were kept on the edge of our seats throughout the season with Mary and Matthew, not to mention the many twists of Bates and Anna.  The season ended too soon and the wait will be too long before we can watch Season 3!!
1439102813|4.0|I devoured Still Alice in one sitting. Great read. The Harvard-educated Genova has a doctorate in neuroscience and weaves a thoroughly believable tale. It's genius, really: she writes from a third-person point of view (and I guess, realistically: the first-person POV of an Alzheimer's patient would require writing the same sentence over and over) but manages to focus almost entirely on Alice's perspective as the disease steals her mind.<br /><br />Having witnessed the progression of Alzheimer's disease, I'll say: Genova writes it spot on, and--for that reason, also her incorporation of scientific facts and research--I consider this book an educational tool. I will say that (in order to keep the ball rolling) she took Alice down fairly quickly, and those of us who have loved ones with the disease know: it doesn't always (if ever) work that way. The slow progression of the disease's stages (while, in many cases, the body continues to function well) can easily be its most challenging aspect.<br /><br />My only other criticism of the novel is purely personal: the most tragic thing about Alice's diagnosis--because of who Alice is, a professor of psychology at Harvard--is the loss of her abilities to work: not the devastation of her family. She and her husband retain, clearly, a high degree of admiration and respect for one another, but the stale quality of their marriage precedes Alice's diagnosis. Their three children are grown, and, for the most part, Genova doesn't show us their pain, although Alice's historically troubled relationship with the youngest child yields the two most touching scenes in the novel.
B004I744AS|3.0|With all the rave reviews and the fact that it was &quot;free&quot;,  even I was surprised how much I wasn't thrilled with this app. I'm the type  of person that always needs a dictionary so this is an important tool for me.<br />My preference is the Merriam Webster app, again the Farlex is not a bad app, it just was not a good fit for me.
B005M0R524|1.0|This Blu-ray should be titled The Incomplete Collection. While the quality was outstanding the marketing as complete  is false advertising. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.

B000063WDH|5.0|The Black Keys has risen to be one of the most influential and popular blues-rock band of the last 10 years, blazing out of Akron, Ohio with their own signature stomp on hill country blues, 60's rock and roll, and on later releases, psychedelic rock. It's a little hard to believe that a 2-piece blues duo ended up doing songs for the NCAA championship.<br /><br />One really doesn't get the grasp of how insanely popular they would get on this debut release for Alive Records, 2002's The Big Come Up. Here, the junkyard band updates on the North Mississippi styles of R.L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough, with enough modern twists on the genre to where they can call it their own. Half of these songs are covers or traditional songs, but with the right amount of dirt and rawness, they might as well be Black Keys originals.<br /><br />Highlights include the stomp of Do The Rump and Busted, the soulful cover of She Said She Said, and groovy songs like Countdown & I'll Be Your Man. Elsewhere, they put a dirty stomp on old traditional tunes like Leavin' Trunk.<br /><br />Obviously, Pat & Dan had a long way to go before selling out arenas. But if you want to start, start here.
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|I like every one of these songs!<br />It plays in my car whenever i drive anywhere.<br />Im very pleased with my purchase of SOS and Tension.<br />They are a great, fun band.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|Written in between a transitional phase for the band, The Black Keys' last release for Fat Possum, 2006's Chulahoma EP finds the band at a great crossroads. Do we continue the dark atmospheric hill country blues of Big Come Up & Thickfreakness, or, do we bring in different influences and experiment a little? The answer is both.<br /><br />This is where the band truly shines: A 6-song tribute to Junior Kimbrough, father of hill country blues, this release has the timeless sound of an old juke joint in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Everything is there: The rough guitar tones, the endless drones, the thundering drums, the ancient production. But what also helps is the swampy psychedelic feel. Organ and maracas decorate Lord Have Mercy On Me, probably the most atmospheric song the band penned up to this point. It certainly led the way for richer albums like Brothers.<br /><br />All in all, this is probably the best thing The Black Keys have ever done. Later albums would abandon this flavor altogether for a more straightforward rock sound. It's a shame, because The Black Keys are one of the best blues bands out today.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I love this CD.  I can't put my finger on it, but it just gets better with every listening.  Of the ilk of Graceland or Rhythm of the Saints.  It just gets under your skin.  If you like these CDs get this and give it 10 or 20 listens before you pass any judgement.
B0013K6WLM|3.0|The Black Keys must've known they were in a musical rut when 2006's Magic Potion wasn't as well recieved as earlier releases. As good as that album was (and still is, it's still my 3rd favorite album by the band), they knew that the guitar-and-drums thing can only go so far. A change of direction was needed. Unfortuantly, for this release, I don't really think it was for the better.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I appreciate change. I just don't think the experiments on this record were all that successful in the long run. On one hand, the band got more skillful at making left turns. The riffs were toned down on this release, and in their place were songs that were more atmospheric and filling than previous releases. All You Ever Wanted is a great Muscle Shoals soul song, with some uplifting church organ. Elsewhere, grooves like Same Old Thing and I Got Mine have interesting flourishes, like flute and backward voices. Also, Psychotic Girl has some pretty sweet banjo.<br /><br />But there are some songs that leave me scratching my head. Did they really need 2 versions of Remember When? Both of them are kinda boring. One is lifeless and dull, the other is a punk song with a very forgettable riff. Lies really doesn't go anywhere, and I just don't care for some of the later tracks like Oceans & Streams.<br /><br />They knew a change would do them good, and I do appreciate the added instrumentation. I just don't think it gelled quite well. They must've took note too, becuase albums like Brothers and El Camino would go back to this route with stronger songwriting skills. Oh well, they can't all be winners.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since I cared as much about characters in a book as I did the people in Wool.  One of the common faults with writers in this genre is that they put so much effort into building a world and a background that they forget to populate it with people that make the reader care about the events in the story.  I cant recall the last time I willed myself to read faster, because these people who had engaged me so thoroughly were in peril.<br /><br />I tore through the omnibus in about 4 hours.  Not that it's that short, rather it grabbed me by the nose and dragged me into this whirlwind upheaval that raged around these characters.  Usually when reading a book, I feel like I'm watching a movie, but with Wool, I forgot the world outside my Kindle, and for those hours, I was in the silo.

1612130283|5.0|This book is amazing. Sure, it's explicit and interesting and it can get you hot but the characters are the cornerstones of this story. Fifty is a fantastic character, he is messed up, lonely, loving, controlling, and lost. He is fabulously destroyed and is perfect for Ana. I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to know more about the characters and where the story was going. Their interactions are full of fire and spirit and you can't help but root for them. I started this book on Sunday after lunch and finished it before I went to bed. Yes, it is that good. I loved the way the story ends and all you want to do is find out what is going to happen next. Such a fun read!

B0071PS7AC|3.0|I understand the frustration with the computer. It wins no matter how well you do.  I bowled a fair game and the computer was always slightly ahead.  once the final 3 throws came I bowled decent but the computer suddenly became pro and bowled 2 strikes and one spare.  the final score was 166 to 160.  since I had done so well and watched the computer win at the last minute bothers me.  but I never threw one gutter ball the entire game, but I did read help first.  I don't believe the game is impossible like some players are claiming.  you just need to be able to read.  I do think the computer needs some difficulty adjustment.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is THE MOST fun I've had reading a book in years.  I fell in love with this book, talking it up to all of my friends... I devoured it.  Now my 12 year old daughter (a huge geek family, we are) has started reading it.  She was cracking up before the first chapter was over.  Thanks, Ernie! Can't wait to see what you do next!

0385534639|5.0|This was an excellent read. The character development is outstanding. What sold me was the attention to detail. It was like a very detailed dream...the kind that you awake wanting to wite down...the kind you try to no avail to desperately re-enter. This book is for all ages and is a recommendation to anyone who appreciates simply leaving this earth one chapter at a time. Erin Morgentstem you have a jewel on your hands...what a wonderful juxtaposition with the image on the cover. YES!!
B004SDEP38|1.0|I downloaded this App, called \\"Main App\\". It's free. I assumed that means it has basic functionality with no frills and a lot of ad banners. However, this not one of your free ad banner apps. It actually does nothing. You can look at files created elsewhere, but so what? It is a \\"bait and switch\\" tactic. You are hooked in by the offer for free software, but in the end you can't use it unless you fork over $15. I think this is really dishonest. Why don't you just list the program at $15 and stop trying to trick people?
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Am I really the only one who thinks the maequin is weird and a little out of place?  The game play is OK. It isn't very challenging but if you need to mindlessly kill some time this is a decent way to do it. The game does run great on my vizio tablet.

B004I2K4E8|2.0|This is a great piece of modern musical art and entertainment.  I've gone to see it in London and have seen it at the Shubert in Century City many times.  In all cases the casts were excellent and the overall effect was moving!  Here comes the 25th anniversary concert on blu-ray with state of the art surround sound!  What a disappointment!  The concert was done in what seemed to be a football stadium, complete with screaming fans who yelled and applauded over most of the orchestral passages.  Each of the \\"singers\\" were equiped with microphones in which each screamed for the entire evening.  Not all the singers were vocally good enough to merit all that amplification.  There is no balance between vocal parts and the orchestra.  The performers stand in place sreaming while the orchestra can't be heard.  This has been a lesson to me.  You can't hear a musical production that has been produced as if it were a football game.

B0052U59F4|5.0|I am in LOVE and his name is Christian!!!!  I don't buy books to judge the editing or the writing style.  I buy books to lose myself for a few hours.  Boy did I lose myself this time.  WOW!!  I finished this book in one day (with a few interruptions for food and laundry).  I immediately ordered and downloaded book two and started reading.  I had to force myself turn off the reader and go to bed at 2 a.m.  After book two, I immediately downloaded book three and started reading.  I have NEVER in my life read a trilogy that fast.  I am so disappointed that my \\"affair\\" with Christian is over.  Not only was the sex scenes hot, but I just loved when she would refer to her inner voices and make funny comments about what they were doing.  I would actually laugh out loud.<br /><br />I enjoyed this trilogy so much that I bought the paperback versions for a friend.
0380977273|5.0|This small town October adventure is better than bobbing for apples and coming up with the grand prize kiss from your middle school crush. I love the poetry in Bradbury's prose. I love the way he writes images that turn the pages into a looking glass you can step through to join hands with his characters. And most of all, I love the way he wrestles with major themes beneath the immediate action. At its heart this read to me like a book about death. About the power we give to evil because of our fear of it. About always looking ahead, be we young or old, and wanting something other than the gift we have right now: the present. Great read.

B001AQT0RC|5.0|As someone who believes that there are literally trillions of inhabited planets out there in the cosmic playground of outer space and that much about their origins and destiny (as well as those pertaining to our own planet) have been revealed and documented within the last century in a series of 196 Papers known collectively as The Urantia Papers (or The Urantia Book) that were authored by various Beings-Not-Of-This-Realm who were commissioned to bestow this epochal revelation upon our planet including translating it into the English language (since English is not the native tongue of either our local universe of Nebadon or our superuniverse of Orvonton or of the Paradise-Havona Central Universe of Divine Perfection which is the dwelling place of the eternal God and around which everything else and everyone else revolves in accordance with the superuniverse plans of evolutionary progress and spiritual attainment), I was predictably pleased to watch a movie that to me asked: Are we really all alone in the universe of universes with this vast enormity of wasted space encircling us like lifeless set decoration or are we rather a part of some gigantic undertaking that is fusing perfection and imperfection and blending science and religion into one creatively unfolding project that is beyond our mortal comprehension to fully fathom and that involves other living beings on other inhabited planets who are in the truest sense, our cosmic cousins? So when I gaze into the starry heavens at the countless suns of space, I marvel at how seemingly insignificant it would superficially appear that our planet is and yet just as this movie highlighted the important role that faith plays whether in regards to believing in a Higher Power or believing in the existence of alien beings far removed from our galactic proximity, I do have faith that our sphere (Urantia) is just as precisely administered and just as lovingly fostered as if it were the only inhabited world in all existence.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This man is a gift... thank whatever god you pray to for him. Because there's a reason why people scream things similar to my review title about him. There's a reason why comments flood the internet trying to mock the fact that a millionaire actually cares about the working class. There's a reason certain people want Springsteen to \\"shut up and sing\\". It's because he scares them. Look at him... he's not supposed to be singing about police brutality and social justice!! He's supposed to be singing about how great America is!<br /><br />Anyways, on to the album. It's a fantastic disc. While Magic still stands as my favorite Springsteen album since Born in the USA, Wrecking Ball is pretty damn close. Miles above the atrocious Working on a Dream, which battles Lucky Town and Human Touch as the worst thing he's ever released.<br /><br />We Take Care of Our Own is both a rallying cry to help the poor and downtrodden, and also a stern criticism directed to those of us who have forgotten the whole \\"we the people\\" thing. A stunning song that really exposes a dark side of the American story.<br /><br />Shackled And Drawn, Easy Money, and Death to My Hometown are great rockers that should be blasted at every polling place this November. They get ya pump up, get ya angry, and get ya yelling. If I didn't know better, I'd say Springsteen was trying to lead a revolution! We shall overcome, indeed...<br /><br />Jack of All Trade has already had a reputation put upon it as a highlight of the album. With lyrics that would fit absolutely perfectly on The Ghost of Tom Joad, it's the kind of story that Springsteen does best. A fantastic case study of the struggle to remain hopeful in the harsh realities of America.<br /><br />The album doesn't hold up quite as well in the middle. This Depression is the first (minor) dud on the album. Its melody is uninteresting, while its lyrics vary oddly from nihilistic pessimism to corny with him calling out for his baby's heart. I just don't think the connection works, and think it's a little weak. Although this may change upon repeated listens.<br /><br />Wrecking Ball is a strange one. I saw him perform this song live, opening up the final show on the Working on a Dream Tour. I absolutely loved it. It became one of my favorite Bruce songs. But when I heard that not only would it be on the new album, it would actually be the title track, I had to scratch my head. Sure, it's a great little novelty song that marks a certain highlight in his recent concert history... but let's not forget he's singing about a friggen football stadium.  Whatever analogy he wants to use to justify it being on the album I just don't buy. It doesn't fit in. A great song, but just not here.<br /><br />We then come to the one horrible song on the album. Like, Queen of the Supermarket bad. You've Got It is so ridiculous in its unoriginality that one must wonder if Springsteen put it on as a joke. And add in the fact that this generic love song falls right in the center of the story of the death of America. What? Horrible filler. Its inclusion here is so baffling that it boarders on embarrassing.<br /><br />It doesn't last long though, because the next song, Rocky Ground, will probably go down as one of Springsteen's most appreciated song. It's sublime in every way. From incorporating the different samples to the gospel chorus to the rap section, it's perfect. This song alone shows the genius of this man. Here, at 62, he's still pushing the boundaries not only lyrically, but also musically.<br /><br />Land of Hopes and Dreams is obviously a great song that the fans adore, but its inclusion here bothers me. Not that it's not a fantastic song, but that it's more than 12 years old. He's been playing it since Clinton was in office. It's the second \\"not new\\" song to be included on the album, and while I do love it, I just can't seem to think that he's cheating a little including it. But it's a great song, nevertheless. A story of undying hope, even if this impossible \\"land\\" that he speaks of is of another world.<br /><br />We are Alive is a great closer. The music rises and falls while depicting several workers who died trying to achieve the American Dream. It offers hope in the face of the darkness. Fight for your rights, even if you'll lose. This cements the key idea that Springsteen has been trying to hammer home for 30 years. Community is essential in the fight for equality. We must unite against the harsh realities of a country under corporate control. Because it's not a fight against one group or one set of ideas, but a fight for the America we've all been told exists, but have never seen.<br /><br />The American Dream has been transformed into a nightmare, and Springsteen have been detailing it since its inception. From Nebraska, to Tom Joad, to Magic, Springsteen consistently stands on the correct side of history. He's a good Lefty that shows his dignity and integrity every step of the way. A necessary voice in a country that has swayed dangerously to the right-wing. He's an American treasure... a phenomenon that eases the pain of a fallen country. And Wrecking Ball sits conformably on the shelf along his other albums that consistently shine a light through the bleak realities of America.<br /><br />With Bruce on our side, how can we possibly lose? Bring it on!<br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />Let a man work!! Is that so wrong?<br /><br />(4.5 stars)

B0064NTZJO|1.0|At first I liked the movie, but then after thinking about if for a few days, I agree with most of the one star reviews. This movie is pretty bad on many levels!

0439023513|1.0|This whole thing is going to be a spoiler, just FYI.<br />Is it just me or did anyone else seriously find themselves stuck underneath a pile of war rubble and come out with an incurable headache. I am assuming what Collins meant to happen was us to understand that this is indeed a war story and that it isn't supposed to be happily ever after and easy to the point.<br />Unfortunately, I feel sad that I even picked up the third book. I was lost and found myself skimming and forgetting what I read. The whole thing is nothing but descriptions of war and you find it very very hard to visualize where Katniss is and whether she is just completely losing her mind. At parts you were supposed to be scared or on edge, I think, I felt like, how did we get here? I even had thoughts while continuing to read, that Suzanne Collins was honestly on acid the entire third book. The first two, I thought, she has an amazing imagination, and that is how she came up with some of the creatures in the games, but the entire third book was just a big giant blurred out acid-fied pile of you name it...crap. The only thing memorable about this book was the fact that her sister dies, she goes back to 12 and she ends up with Peeta after being ruled insane from a trial you never see after killing the president. I feel like these ideas are what Collins was aiming for while writing the book...but she got so lost in trying to create a war story that she forgot that this book can't go on forever......you would think that you would be satisfied that she chose Peeta, but all I can think is, Gale disappeared...out of sight, out of mind and she just chose what she had left to work with...I would have rather her heart break and FEEL something for once seeing Gale fall for someone else and not just assuming he left on some \\"awesome\\" job that was more important than his apparent love for her.<br />You could say that the majority of readers read this book to see who Katniss would end up with, and truthfully, yeah, that was the reason why I continued to read after desperately trying to finish this third book. It totally lacks the visualization and connection between Katniss and ALL of the other characters, including her connection with Haymitch. I would assume you were supposed to cry with Katniss when she finally takes into account that her sister is dead, but she had no connection with Prim the entire book, so honestly, I didn't even care. Im going to have to give this a thumbs down and stop recommending it to people like I did after the first one
B0060Q962Q|2.0|This is a computer, why only copy the board game.  It would be so simple to make smaller and larger board sizes.  In fact with a larger board size you could allow three or more players.  And you could make five in a row a winner, etc.  Or have a rotating board... I just think this is too simple.  Even the original board game has more modes like pop out.  Just one game, no levels, just computer difficulty.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|I've been hooked on CW for a while.  I recorded the \\"Songs from the Heart\\" PBS concert on my DVR in March 2011.  I pray the box never goes bad or I will loose the recording.  I did copy it using a DVD burner (borrowed from Best Buy) but the audio was just 2 channel and not the 5.1 Dolby of my recording.  Ibroke down and downloaded it from I-tunes.  All of summer 2011 I anxiously awaited the new concert and for it to air.  I knew Alex Sharpe had left (I love her solo of You'll be in my Heart) but was in shock when I saw that Lynn had left too.  At first I was not sure about her replacement, Lisa Lambe.  It did not take long but I was hooked on her voice and the sexiness she brings to the stage in the concert.  I was going to buy tickets for the NY show in March.  Glad I didn't because I found out that Lisa Kelly had gone on maternity leave.  I have the Believe concert from PBS on my DVR as well and used Audacity to record the audio to my computer.  Good thing recordings don't go on vinyl or tape, because I would have worn them out already.  It is just about the only thing I listen too.  I am hoping that Lisa Kelly returns.  From interviews, she has said she loves being on the road with her family.  With the CW concert schedule, they certainly don't stay anywhere long enough for any moss to grow.  I have not yet heard Susan McFadden, and wonder if she will stay to return the group to 4 vocalists.

B007H51DQG|5.0|Both seasons are great - I personally like season 2 a bit more than season 1.  Expect the violence to be gritty, gruesome, & unforgiving because the story is about surviving in a world saturated with zombies. Because the meat of the story is about survival, you shouldn't be surprised that there will be a good dose of drama and character building.  I think the show does a great job at depicting each character's internal and emotional struggles.  Finally, it is actually the human species that are anarchists and struggle with co-existing.  The zombies are a peaceful species with an overly active appetite for fresh food.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|It's like watching an original print on the Big Screen in a movie theater - it's equal to the Blu-ray quality of \\"The Searchers\\"; i.e. *cannot* be any better. What is it about 35mm films of the mid-1950s that lends them to such remarkable transfers?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of my sons. They told me that I should read. I bought the book, and read in it a few days. I thought it was the most exciting book that I have read in a long time. It held my attention from the first page to the very last. The author wrote such great vivid details, and got us up close into the characters lives.<br /><br />Great book. I would recommend it to anyone.

B006ZCWU5K|2.0|Wrecking Ball, for me, relies too heavily on the Seeger Sessions Band for my liking.  The Seeger Sessions Band is a great band for what they do, but I MUCH would rather hear E Street.  Steven appears on one song, Clarence on two songs, and Max on three songs.  Patti contributes background vocals throughout the album, but there's no Gary Tallent, no Nils Lofgren, and no Roy Bittan.  And I know the argument that artists want/need to grow and expand, but this album was touted as his \\"best\\" (quote from Bruce).  Please.  Not even close.  If Bruce/his label are gonna make those kind of claims/hype, then I'm going to expect a helluva lot more than this. It has its moments, it's not all bad by any means, but if this is considered an \\"angry\\" album (I believe that was a Jon Landau quote), then Bruce just doesn't have a lot of anger in him.  I just have a major problem with Bruce doing a bunch of Irish pub songs.  If that's what he wants to do, fine, do it, but there's no way on God's green earth that an album with multiple Irish pub songs is going to be his \\"best\\".  Blatant false advertising.<br /><br />And I wasn't going to mention this, but as I sit here listening to the album for the 3rd time, I find myself getting angrier about this album, and am now compelled to point out, THERE'S A WOMAN RAPPING ON THIS ALBUM!  C'MON!!!  SERIOUSLY BRUCE?!?!?!  You thought having a woman rapping (\\"Rocky Ground\\") was necessary?  I actually found it embarrassing.  I was embarrassed FOR Bruce.  No, this album is only for the die-hards who are too blind to consider anything Bruce does could be less than perfect.  To me, it's on par with Working On a Dream, and that's not a compliment.<br /><br />Truth is, I still love Bruce and his music, and I'll see him out on the tour this year.  The man has composed so many masterpieces, and is one of the greatest live performers ever.  I just think this album is not up to par.  Not even close.
1612130283|3.0|First, a disclaimer. I am a male senior citizen, a semi-retired gynecologist whose customary literary fare is spy novels and military techno-thrillers. I have never read a romance before, except perhaps for junior high's \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" (or was that a classic?) But after the recent hullabaloo over James' \\"Fifty Shades,\\" I opted to give the genre a glance.<br /><br />The book's protagonist is college student Anastasia, who has never had sex or even \\"touched herself.\\" I had to suspend disbelief at the social and sexual naivete of this twenty-one year-old, but I guess this implied vulnerability makes her more attractive as a romantic heroine. Yet it doesn't take her long to rectify this situation, and soon she is having orgasm after orgasm at the behest of her \\"dominant\\" partner, Mr. Grey. At my age, my arthritis flared up just reading about Ana's sexual gymnastics. And for some reason, I kept thinking about her contracting genital warts. Soon, however,  Ana's endless pyrotechnic climaxes resembled repetitively watching porn: after a while, it leaves  me bored and yawning. That said, there was a definite infectiousness to the plot; and taking Viagra to stiffen my resolve, I persevered.<br /><br />James' strong suit is her ability to elicit sympathy in the protagonist. I wanted to find out what happened to Anastasia, and that lent the story a compelling, page-turning quality. James is a polished novelist. Her dialogue is crisp, her prose poised, and her paragraphs well-parsed. The author's considerable skills notwithstanding, would I pick up an erotic romance like this again? Probably not.<br /><br />But that's just me.
B007H51DQG|5.0|The story line is getting more interesting now. Honestly, season two was so boring I wanted to beat my head on the table.<br /><br />Now we are actually getting to the meat and potatoes of how this situation at the farm is playing out in the long run. Rick was correct in his assessment at first regarding the injured gunman. He did the right thing by saving him, and letting him have a chance. However, the moment that the gunman mentioned that he went to school with Maggie was the moment he should have been shot. The gunman would have eventually led his group back to the farm where Maggie lived. At this point, Rick had no idea how many men were in the other group. With that being said though, if Rick hadn't hesitated, Shane and Rick would have never gotten into the brawl which brought them closer as buddies again.<br /><br />At the public works, there was a situation with the two security guards in how they actually became walkers. The look on Rick's face as he was viewing them on the ground reflected to me that it was something he knew, and was just seeing for the first time. (Could this be what Doctor Jenner at the CDC whispered to him before the escape?) Could the virus that causes the walkers be turning from a blood borne to an airborne threat now? Many diseases mutate in such ways...<br /><br />Also, while I am on the topic of what Dr. Jenner told Rick, remember that there were blood tests that the Doctor did on all personnel coming into the CDC when he allowed them in for safety reasons. Did Doctor Jenner also tell Rick that his wife was pregnant at that time? There wouldn't have been time for her to show that quickly on a test, which will reflect that Shane actually is the father of the baby.<br /><br />The thirty men in the gunman's group apparently have no remorse, and are cold hearted people (The gunman's admission to Darryl about the rape of the two teenage girls in front of her father at the campsite is telling of the morals of his group).  I do believe however, that this plot will transpire and reveal that the leader of the thirty men is no other than Darryl's brother Merle. Remember in season one, Merle cut off his own hand to get off of the rooftop after being handcuffed to a pipe by Rick. There is going to be obvious ramifications to Rick and his group if this is the case. Also, if Merle is the leader of the group, what loyalty will Darryl show? Will he be loyal to his own brother and betray the others? Or, will he finally be turned enough to be a good person to see Merle for what he is, and ultimately save the farm by killing his brother? If I were the writer, I would place this into the plot. It only makes sense. This farm is not too far from Atlanta where Merle was left...<br /><br />The farm itself is a small oasis in the middle of hell. There seem to be more and more walkers that are coming from seemingly no where now. Are these the walkers that were walking the road in a herd in season two on the highway, and have now scattered? There were alot of vehicles on that road, which would have a potential to have hundreds of walkers in the area. With the shooting going on at the farm, I don't know if that is drawing them back in now or not.<br /><br />I have noticed that there is no more communication attempts by Rick to the man and boy who saved him in season one. I am not sure if that is going to play out later or not. Is this man and boy in the group of thirty? It would be interesting to see them re-united again.<br /><br />Carol and Darryl seem to be getting closer together. This could provide stability for him, and keep him from leaving the group regardless of how he feels about many of the others.<br /><br />Shane just needs to finally accept that Lori is not going to be interested in him anymore. I do not know if the car crash perhaps has made her miscarry somehow though. What would be worse as a plot than to have Shane realize the baby was his, and that god forbid a walker hears the baby cry and kills it?That would prove that Shane could not keep his own child safe, and disprove all of his comments about Rick after all. It is a bad scene, but shock value is what the show is all about. I haven't seen any infants as zombies yet. That would really be disturbing to witness.<br /><br />Well, that is my take on it. I wonder if it will play out eventually as I see it.
B005TZFZJC|4.0|Well, i was very surprised Rihanna will take a new studio album, caused of her managers! So it was amazing though, but the line to follow David Guetta songs cannot be the right way to follow the roots of her country, but ok, if needed! For me it was a big pleasure to hear Rihanna something like reggea music, you know the track when it sounds :) So ill give it 4 balls, cuz of the good production, and some kinda reggae! Go on further, dear Rihanna but please take a pause. if you need this advice, put your back down low to receive the world famous by doing a reggea version, pssssssst iam your dj, no it was a lie :)

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I dont wanna support Whitney cause she was always supported by my heart! Iam gonna take you, although your mind was investigated by beauty, and....:-* Top Production!
B005OK721G|4.0|The seriously annoying trailer (\\"Never forget where you came from.\\") almost kept me from watching this film. But I consider Zoe Saldana to be a must-see performer, and so I caved. And, as it turns out, COLOMBIANA is nowhere near as funky as that lame trailer made it out to be. Zoe Saldana brings out the sultry and submits a strong acting performance. If only the script hadn't undercut her. COLOMBIANA can't seem to make up its mind on whether it's more an action film or a dramatic one. No, we don't quite get a seamless blend of the two genres.<br /><br />Child actress Amandla Stenberg, with her stillness and poise and haunting silences, deserves all manner of props. She carries the first half hour of the movie, and you can't take your eyes off her. Stenberg plays Cataleya, a 9-year-old girl in gang-infested Bogota whose parents are shot up to bits in front of her.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, an FBI profiler (Lennie James, always good) is obsessed with nabbing an assassin who's committed 22 gaudy murders within the past four years, never mind that each of the assassin's targets is a \\"professional bad apple.\\" The FBI agent knows it's the same killer because he always marks his victims with an image of a Colombian orchid. Later he learns that the flower is called a \\"cataleya.\\" Connect now your own dots.<br /><br />If I hadn't seen Gina Carano in bonecrunching action in HAYWIRE, I'd be even more rhapsodic over Zoe Saldana's action hero creds. As it is, Saldana evolves from her badasss role in THE LOSERS. Thrust that much more in the spotlight, she easily carries the bits of the film that Amandla Stenberg doesn't carry. The similarity between the two actresses is remarkable. So credit Zoe for capturing Amandla's sense of gravity about herself, and also that quiet fierceness. For her part, Zoe combines her dramatic skills - her Cataleya looks so desolate at times - with a dynamic and, frankly, very sexy physicality. I like that the grown-up Cataleya - and, yes, she grew up to be a professional assassin - is calculating and meticulous. She plans her contract hits. She carries out her plans flawlessly. But the closer she gets to her ultimate target - him what ordered the hit on her parents - she allows her emotions to get to her. She becomes sloppy. It costs her.<br /><br />Michael Vartan, by the way, serves as Saldana's love interest. It's almost not worth mentioning this.<br /><br />COLOMBIANA is style over substance, despite Saldana's powerhouse presence. The problem lies with several over-the-top moments, those inane flourishes which ultimately undermine the strong acting. There are two particularly egregious scenes. Early on, 9-year-old Cataleya's gangster tio, to prove some sort of point, takes out his gun in broad daylight, in front of an elementary school, and shoots off a round which sends a passing car careening into a halt. As police sirens wail, the tio delivers his lecture - something about education as a building block for all assassins-in-training - and then they just casually stroll away, with apparently no one having seen the guy firing his weapon. This is an absurd scene. The other laying-it-on-thick sequence involves pet sharks in a baddie's pool. One glance at that, and you just know Cataleya will be incorporating the sharks in one of her kills. When the payoff arrives, it happens as a quick one and done camera shot. It's a death dealt too quickly, and, gorehound that I am, I felt cheated.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana in graceful action is why I tuned in. If she has a calling card as a mighty arsekicker, it's that one brutal hand-to-hand combat scene late in the movie in which Saldana transforms a towel and three toothbrushes into deadly weapons. It's almost as good a sequence as Cataleya's layered infiltration of a police precinct. Providing you can overlook the film's silly excesses, you may find yourself immersed in COLOMBIANA. Saldana is terrific.<br /><br />Just remember: \\"Never forget where you came from.\\"<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- \\"COLOMBIANA: The Making Of\\" featurette (00:25:07 minutes)<br />- \\"Cataleya's Journey\\" - includes interviews with Zoe Saldana and Amandla Stenberg (00:09:31 minutes)<br />3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- \\"COLOMBIANA: The Making Of\\" featurette (00:25:07 minutes)<br />- \\"Cataleya's Journey\\" - includes interviews with Zoe Saldana and Amandla Stenberg (00:09:31 minutes)
B0041OOJNU|3.0|Nun nach langer Zeit, beraube ich mir mal auch aus Respekt vor Shakira, mal einem Kommentar! Ich gebe zu, dass dieses Album sehr schnell auf den Markt geworfen wurde, doch wer lange gewartet hat, bekommt auch noch die EP dazu! Wie man etwas vermarktet oder nicht, hat mit unter höchstens ein schnödes Lächeln zum Schein, darüber sollte man sich im Klaren sein! Wichtig ist doch, ich hab alles mit diesm Album, und ich mag Shakira! Und ich bedanke mich. 3 Sterne! Tu sabes porque!
B0052U59F4|1.0|This book came up in my book club as a possible selection. Curious to see what everyone was so excited about, I got it for my Kindle.  I couldn't get past the third chapter.  This is truly one of the worst pieces of literature (if you can even call it that) that I have read in years.  There is absolutely no character development.  Twenty year olds have the diaglogue of someone twice their age.  People are either arching their eyebrows or gasping.  The author states the obvious early on in this book and then it all becomes about the graphic parts that bring most people to this book in the first place.  If you want a book that depicts graphic S/M, read \\"8 1/2 Weeks\\" which is not only based on a true story, but better written.  How this author stretched this into a trilogy is beyond comprehension.
0545265355|5.0|The quality of the books were really good. I don't think there were any problems with it and the books came in on time. I'm very satisfied with everything I got and plus, I'm INLOVE with the trilogy!! 5 stars :)
B001DM1VXE|2.0|785398 (usually .7854) is what is used by engineers to find such things as area of a circle; multiply the square of the diameter or the volume of a cylinder.  It was found in the original Egyptian calculations the Greeks barrowed. It is also used to convert degrees to radians. O.K. enough of this.<br /><br />This is a very noisy film. Some of the music you will recognize. At least it the background notice does not overwhelm the little dialog there is. The film was shot in black and white which actual adds another worldly detention to the story.<br /><br />The movie that tells the tale of Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette) a person obsessed with math or numbers and attempts to anticipate the stock market. Others encourage him. He has a friend Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis) who tries to discourage him. Eventually he is used to reveal the name of God. Poor Max what will become of him?<br /><br />If you are interested in the story that Sol tells about  Archimedes and his ‘Eureka!” moment then you will be interested in a real one in the book and  documentary of “ The Narnia Code.”
B0071PS7AC|1.0|my ball kept going to the gutter. why do people create stupid games like these. i hate it. and the game is also un fair
0385342063|2.0|Not much to say about his one besides it felt like a waste. From two pages in you know exactly what will happen, and it does NOTHING new or interesting or exciting.<br /><br />Poppy is so stupid that I couldn't even get into the story I was so frustrated with her. I know that Kinsella was going for cute and quirky, but it didn't happen and is FAR from endearing. No woman on this earth could actually think she can go through some random business man's work email,(and man she has never before met, btw), involve herself in his work affairs, and get away with it. Seriously, who would do that? No one. At least no one over the age of 14.<br /><br />Also, the whole concept was so unrealistic. The idea that the only way this guy could check is email is on that partucular phone? REALLY? None of these people have access to a computer? No they don't. Why? Because it's the only way the story could possibly work.<br /><br />Trust me you've read this before; and the older versions are much better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i think this is reasonably fun but needs to be open for all games, all games should be unlocked insted of goals to win them
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is great has everything I like and the games are not hard at all so this game deserves 5 stars
B0060Q962Q|3.0|Its connect 4 and done pretty well. The only issues I have is how in the world is this thing so freaking big, and good lord the music is obnoxious. Yes you can turn the music off but a 5* game means great in every aspect. If there was a category for just connect 4 clones this would be a strong 4.5 stars but as an overall game its pretty meh. Its a quick nostalgia trip that will be the first to be uninstalled when you're cleaning your device.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Product is exactly as advertised and even better really. Color is bright (I got the pink) and it's really cute. Lightweight but covers the Kindle really well. I like that I can fold back the cover and hold it on the back with the stretchy band. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quality case for an amazing price!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game and so do my kids so keep up the good work. It keeps u interested and havering fun with ur little one it is fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if i do this i get 250000 points YAY its awesome many games to play make. a review and get free points
B005Z271Y6|5.0|If you're an Adele fan, you'll LOVE it! The voice this woman has is amazing, and to listen to her talk to the crowd between songs is funny, although she's got a bit of a potty mouth, so if you're getting this for a younger family member, you might want to get the edited version.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I heard a lot about this show during the awards season this year.  I knew that the series was supposed to be really good, and I love Maggie Smith.  I had absolutely no clue what it was about, but I bought the first series (season 1) when I found it on sale.  I was hooked from episode 1.  It is a truly amazing show.  I found myself not wanting it to end.  I watched series 1 and 2 in a little over a week.  I cannot wait until the 3rd series premiere in the US.<br /><br />If you like historical fiction, you will like this show.  It shows the dynamic relationships between the nobility and their staff.  Additionally, this show has characters that you absolutely hate (O'Brien) and characters that you absolutely love.  The first two series (seasons) span about eight years, so a lot happens in a short amount of episodes.  It is truly a fantastic show and worthy of all the praise and attention is has been receiving.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about buying it, go ahead and do it.  You won't be sorry!  Make sure you have enough time to watch multiple episodes in a row when you start watching.  Trust me; you won't want to stop!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I like the game.  Not sure why all the complaints about the ball control, did you guys read the instructions?  Move the ball all the way to the right or left to get the spin started then move back towards the middle before releasing.  Simple.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I love this book and hate it at the same time.  It completely left me breathless.  Even though I could tell what was coming, I had to keep reading.  I had to know.  I cannot wait for the next book.  This book is 100% addicting.  If you like intense, Twilight-esque romances, this book is for you.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|the sensitivity is a bit touchy, but well made otherwise. There might be a way to adjust it and I haven't found it
0439023521|4.0|I read this book without knowing much about it and I was blown away. It's a book that has been marketed to teens and young adults, but there are so many political under(over)tones, that it makes for a great read all around.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love love love it!<br />This is the most awesome Bible app out there.<br />It is easy to listen too and read.<br />Thank you
B007BLDFWG|2.0|After reading all of the positive reviews,I was looking forward to this,unfortunately,I was disappointed.I don't think it's worth a $3.99 rental,wait for it to be available at Redbox.Two other indie movies I've seen on Amazon. Whistleblower and Puncture,both true stories, I liked a lot more.Would like to see Elizabeth Olsen in another movie.Her performance is fine,all the actors are fine,it was more the script and dialogue,or lack of it, I didn't like.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|sooo much fun! challenging yet simple. keeps me busy all day and I can keep trying to beat my highscores over and over again
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is fun. play it on kindle fire. kids like it too. buy upgrades with your nuts. hay woo boo googoo
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I watched about an hour of this on WTTW Channel 11 the other night and was floored.  The sound, editing, band, everyone is STELLAR.  I had pre ordered this right away as Joe can do no wrong in my book...another great release, and from the Blu Ray track list much different set list than Royal Albert as this release coincides with Dust Bowl. Beth Hart, John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers each guest on 2 tracks apiece.  Amazing concert.  Enjoy!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The game is great, and previously ran fine on my Xoom with Honeycomb. However, since updating to ICS, I've had nothing but problems. The game will freeze partway into levels. This occurs on both the Xoom and on my Galaxy nexus. No amount of tweaks will fix this, such as compatibility mode, or disabling of forced hardware acceleration. Would love to update this to five stars, looking forward to an update...
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book came into its own in the second half.  It is fairly a fast read made for young adults clearly.  It is an enjoyable read and I think folks will get a kick out of it
B000RH0C8G|4.0|I was really interested in reading this book. I have been kind of a fan of baseball and even though I do not consider myself an expert on the field, I was really attracted, specifically because I remember that season when the A's set a new record of 20 wins.<br /><br />My bottom line comment would be that the story itself sells the book. I am not saying the writer did a poor job. I found the first part kind of slow but after you pass the first half, believe me, you will be addicted.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this all of the time, especially when I'm praying for a snow day. As a teacher with an early morning commute, this app is incredibly useful.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|after searching stores today unsucessfully for travel games for our spring trip, i was happy to find this classic game that my kids will be able to play together (or against the computer). different themes under the options is an added bonus!
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|When my boyfriend's mother passed away many years ago, we inherited a variety of items from the household. One was a box of 78 records. We needed a turntable that played 78 records in order to enjoy this legacy. We put the project off for at least a decade, but finally we decided to take action and get the records into the hands of people who appreciated them.<br /><br />First, we had to play the records to make sure they were in good shape. We needed a turntable. We had given our own away at least fifteen years ago, so it was time to buy a new one. The Numark PT-01 USB Turntable was the one we chose to work with.<br /><br />The setup on this is extremely easy. There's a software CD that comes with the unit. Within minutes we had the USB cable running from the turntable to my computer, and the software let me easily work with the stream of music which came out.<br /><br />With most turntables out there not supporting the 78 speed, definitely a plus here is that the Numark PT-01 DOES support 78, as well as 33 and 45. I imagine that the needle here is not the top quality - after all the price on this unit is fairly inexpensive for what it does. Still, my boyfriend and I are both musicians so we're fairly attentive to sound quality, and this was fairly good. It did represent well the state of the 78 records.<br /><br />I had no problem at all using the turntable on 50 different records, listening to both sides of each. The turntable played smoothly, the music was of good quality, and I was able to import the music files into iTunes with the push of a button.<br /><br />Well recommended if you have a collection of old records that you would like to quickly and easily import into your online music library.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent show. Very happy with the series, with the exception that it lasted too short. We are anxious for season 3. Have seen season 2 twice and watching it on PBS on Sundays. Great show Thank you PBS and BBC.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|the hunger games was a good choose of a kid like me. at first i wasnt pulled in like some other reviews and i found it was a slow start off.  once i got to the end though i wasnt able to put it down i basicly caried it every where read when i got the chance(read it in 2 days and nights thats how addictive a book can be).<br /><br />but i found that i loved the action and how it was executed.<br /><br />i think ages 11 or under shouldnt read this book unless they are very different and can handle very graffic and well disturbing sence through out the book. one other think is it had to much kissing in it.i do not regret my purchase though it could have been a better book it is still one of my favorets. but i think im not going to see the movie when its released because of the gore and kissing.<br /><br />well lets conclude it could have been better but it still was a great book thanks for reading logging off.
B00280LYIC|5.0|one of the best books i have read in a long time. great characters and details. an all around amahzing book!!!

B00008WT5M|4.0|I really like RAZOR'S EDGE, the best album since FLICK OF THE SWITCH...All the songs rocks with a kind of poppier sound, but still heavy and true! The huge hit THUNDERSTRUCK, RAZOR'S EDGE, ROCK YOUR HEART OUT and SHOT OF LOVE are good rockers!!!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I have read and re-read this little book , over and over again! Her ideas on downsizing and simplifying are some of the best I have read. In fact, Ive read alot of minimalism books and this one is my FAVORITE. I loved the \\"couch\\" story and also how she tells us girls a great way to declutter our closets and chose a primary color to wear each day . Makes great sense. My family is not \\"into\\" downsizing which makes living this way a little more challenging for me , however, I do what I can in MY own sections of the house and closet, etc. Im now working on getting rid of my debts. Again, tricky when you have a husband that doesnt like to pay bills..but Im getting there. If you have the notion to downsize and simplify your life...start here . Dont waist your time with any other books !!!
B000062YAY|5.0|DECADE OF AGRESSION is one of the best live albuns of all time!!! It´s like a SLAYER GREATEST HITS album, recorded in the SLAYER GOLDEN YEARS!!! If you like Slayer, you will love DECADE OF AGRESSION...Great compilation of live Slayer songs!!!!!SSLLAAAAAYEEEEEEERRRR!!!!!!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was well worth the money. When I ordered the book I was expecting the usual \\"garbage\\" on how to lose weight. You know, eat healthy exercise etc. etc. This book is an excellent \\"Expose\\" on the damage that current wheat products are doing to our bodies. The<br />FDA agrees with everything Dr. Davis has to say, but they will not make the information<br />available to the general population. Consequently the government agency that is supposed to protect us from \\"bad\\" food has been mysteriously silent.  Is it because E.I.Dupont spends a lot of money lobbying our Congress??  Read the book, you will learn a lot, and lose weight.<br />For those who require a lot of technical information, this is the right book for you.
B001F7EZ9Y|3.0|AC DC are rock legends, and after so many years they still ROCK HARD with BLACK ICE!!!! There's 3 or 4 songs that i really don't care too much, but there's great tracks like ROCK N' ROLL TRAIN, WAR MACHINE and BLACK ICE!!!!I f you like AC DC you probably will like this one!!!!

B002OEBMN4|5.0|SLAYER creates another modern thrash metal beast with WORLD PAINTED BLOOD!!! Like on Christ Illusion, you can feel that the return of DAVE LOMBARDO to the drums did really well to SLAYER...Both are great, Christ Illusion and World Painted Blood!!!It's like the old SLAYER in a kind of modern thrash metal, with high lights like SNUFF, HATE WORLDWIDE, PUBLIC DISPLAY OF DISMEMBERMENT and PSYCHOPATHY RED!!!! WELL DONE, SLAYER...MASTERS OF THE THRASH METAL!!!!
B006JJBFK0|5.0|All kidding aside, comparisons to Nightwish are inevitable, and indeed quite appropriate. The voice of Xandria's new vocalist--Manuela Kraller--has what many voices in female fronted metal lack; raw emotional operatic power! She makes no secret of the fact that Nightwish and Tarja are two of her favorite bands and their influence can clearly be heard in her singing style. The moment she started singing in the first track, I immediately thought \\"Tarja!\\"<br /><br />The similarities to old Nightwish don't end with the vocalist. The music is different than what you would hear in a previous Nightwish album, and yet sounds similar as well.<br /><br />For those of you who have been starving for female fronted metal with POWER since Tarja departed Nightwish, this is your replacement! I didn't care overmuch for Xandria's previous stuff, but their new vocalist and musical style represent a dramatic shift away from their previous material; a GOOD shift. Xandria will soon claim the crown once held exclusively by Nightwish if they keep this up in future albums, and I hope they do!
B000UZ4CWW|5.0|The return of the drum master Dave Lombardo is the high light from this great SLAYER album Christ Illusion...I don´t like the 2 previous Slayer albuns Diabolus and God H us all, which i really think are uninspired albuns...but Christ Illusion and the presence of Lombardo shows fast old time thrashers like FLESH STORM, CATALYST, SKELETON CHRIST, CONSFEARACY and CULT!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is free and fun .....that's a win win! ! this game works great on my kindle.The whole family like playing it.

B006UG90RM|1.0|At first I was thrilled when I got this for my birthday, but I have to say, as I listened to all the tracks from beginning to end, I was really disappointed.  The songs didn't grab me, they weren't catchy, & I will not listen to the cd ever again.  Dave's voice is all over the place, & Eddie tries to rip off Steve vai in areas.  These tracks aren't radio friendly or commercial or \\"sing-along\\" at all....<br /><br />*I'll stick to all their old stuff that I have in my collection.  nuff said on this.
B001KTVVZS|5.0|I read A Long Way Gone a few years ago and fell in love with the book. I'm not an avid reader simply because I often lose interest-- that did't happen here. It is an absolute page turner.  It is captivating, heart-wrenching and triumphant. This is a true story that should be read, digested and given to a friend.
B005K17RU0|4.0|easy to use and read. right most of the time. good graphics good good. easy. doesn't drain the batttery. good
B0060Q962Q|5.0|Just like the original game except this theme options and difficulty settings to give yourself a challenge. Doesn't ask for ANY unnecessary permissions either. Worth paying for.
B0058VW36U|2.0|all you do is sling a mint into this frog looking thing's mouth yes i no it looks like a good game but is you fall for buying it, it is a waist
B004X2M3SI|5.0|I love Doctor Who and decided I couldn't wait the months for Netflix to put up season 6. (Especially because my smug friends have BBC America and kept dropping spoilers.) So I bought season 6 on Amazon and managed to watch about 4 episodes before I gave up. The video would only play on my laptop screen, not my computer monitors and, honestly, the quality was kind of poor. And heaven forbid there be an Amazon app on my PS3 (I blame that partly on Sony). So after trying to watch the action on a 13\\" screen for 4 episodes, I gave up and waited for Netflix to get it. I love the selection Amazon has for its instant video, but it's going to have to seriously change the quality and ways I can watch before I consider buying another season of anything on Amazon again.<br /><br />Note: I did finish watching season 6 and I loved it. Can't wait for season 7.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|if you like the season angry birds than you have to love this game becase it basically the same thing but different set up on the levels and some of them are easyier and harder
B0060Q962Q|3.0|Why no online play? Computer is boring and 2 player on one device is boring unless you have.a tablet. Online would rule like words with friends style where u could make your move later not just having to play right away. Otherwise its a good clone. I'm with the one guy who reviewed earlier, connect 4 was awesome as a kid. Sad everything has to be digital these days for kids to enjoy stuff. Do kids even know what board games are these days?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I go to the doctors. a lot..so I have a lot of games to play with the 101-in-1 games ...thank you!
B0060Q962Q|1.0|I'm giving this 1 star because I feel like it Yahweh seriously, you mad bro? :D.... . . . . .. . . . . . ..
0439023491|5.0|Alright, I'm 21 yrs old. I'm not a fourteen year old ranting and raving about this book. If you liked the first, you will like the second. I could barely put it down. I see alot of people with negative reviews saying it was this and that. It is what it is.. a teen read. BUT I loved it and I know so many others have.. I would reccomend it to anyone.. and I DO! Maybe not pre-teens though. GOOD BOOK, FUN READ.
B0060Q962Q|2.0|You aren't your customers mommy and daddy. If someone has a limited data plan, it is their responsibility to turn wifi on. I have unlimited 4g and never use wifi because it is slower than 4g. Turn off this stupid restriction.
B004GHIHD0|4.0|I was lead to this primarily because it is part of ZTT's Element series which I have been slowly collecting.  they have been re-releases and compilations that usually have loads of rare tracks and info about them.  I have gotten a lot of propaganda tracks amongst them and like them a lot so I was eager to pick this one up.<br /><br />While the music contained is pretty great overall there are several things that disapoint me and cause me to not give 5 stars.<br /><br />1. Lack of detailed booklet.  the booklet included basically just gives basic info about tracks and has some nice artwork.  I was expecting a nice essay about Claudia's career and some more info about the genesis of these tracks especially for the tracks exclusive to the set.<br /><br />2. There should have been more music.  running at 66 minutes I feel that there could have been a few more tracks.  for me a compilation should use all the cds space to give as much bang for your buck.  this is doubly annoying when you see that the digital version of the album has 3 alternate tracks in place of some of the tracks here.  those tracks actually look more interesting to me because they are somewhat harder to come by then the ones on the album.  but really they all could have fit to make this a really great compilation.<br /><br />However beyond that we have a good mix of the great tracks and some rare tracks and some new tracks.  for me In Dreams makes the album for me it is beautiful and  (I believe) exclusive to this cd.<br /><br />A good cd but not a perfect cd.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought two cases for my new Kindle fire, and each had its good reviews and its bad reviews. I returned the other and kept this one. I think with these covers a lot of the appeal is personal. I like this cover because it is pretty, and because the Kindle fits inside with a little overlap of the cover's front and back so I felt the edges of my unit were better protected. The straps fit snugly enough that I'm comfortable with how securely it's seated into the case. I was a little leery about the case's longevity because it isn't leather, but I'll have to see that over time. Overall I really like it.
B003E48AYC|5.0|My kids (10 and 7) went to the theaters to watch this one.  We loved it!  I had some reservations about the \\"Off with the head\\" lines.  The floating heads in the moat was my big concern.  However, my 7 yr old LOVES the movie, and does not seem scared or concerned about that scene.  She loves the grown-up Alice!  Johnny Depp, of course, does an awesome job.  After we watched in the theater, me and another friend starting walking and acting like the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).  Her 8 yr old starting screaming (jokingly) in embarrassment.  It was hilarious!!  This is a great adaptation to the original Disney movie.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Based on a book by Michael Morpurgo and adapted by two Oscar-nominated writers Lee Hall (\\"Billy Elliot\\") and Richard Curtis (\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\"), Steven Spielberg's \\"War Horse\\" has a lot of great footage in it. Every scene is beautifully shot and most actors deliver solid performances. Battle scenes are fierce. The no man's land scene is poignant and even humorous. All these sequences are fine, showing what Spielberg can do. However, as a whole, \\"War Horse\\" just doesn't work well.<br /><br />It is a story of a thoroughbred named Joey and a young boy Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) living in Devon, England. When the World War I breaks out, Joey is sent across the Channel with British soldiers to the battlefield. Albert, still too young to enlist the army, vows that he will find Joey no matter what it takes.<br /><br />It is an uplifting story, I admit, but some part of the filmed adaptation just doesn't convince. Why does Mr. Narracott (Peter Mullan) insist on purchasing Joey, a thoroughbred, when he knows this is not a good idea to plough for his farm? Why does the French grandfather let his granddaughter ride the horse alone on the hill when he should know it is still wartime?<br /><br />All these things would not be a big problem if the story is told from Joey's viewpoint, but on a big screen, they serve to no purpose but to further the story, which becomes very sentimental. Spielberg is after all a master of audience manipulation (and I don't think it's a bad thing), but compared with his past works like \\"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,\\" his hand to manipulate is too conspicuous here.<br /><br />Finally, the film is basically a war movie and includes a combat scene. Unlike his \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" the mass carnage of World War I is toned down, but I am not sure \\"War Horse\\" should be called a family picture. \\"War Horse\\" is certainly a touching film, but that is partly because there are so many who are not as lucky as the film's heroes.
1469984202|5.0|I read the original Wool short story and was pleasantly surprised by its brilliance. The day I learned it had morphed into a novel was absolutely fantastic, I give it my very best recommendations.<br /><br />I never review, this is my first, it's that good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun game to play. helps me relax and puts me to sleep. I definatly recommend anyone to play this game.
0525478817|5.0|I love how he writes, but that's just a personal thing.<br />The novel is hilarious and thought-provoking.<br />Yes, it is a keeper in my opinion.<br />Thank you, Mr. John Green.
B000002MJC|5.0|Great album about struggle of faith, judgement, & perils of sin vs piety. My favorite two songs on this album have to be \\"walking in my shoes\\" & \\"condemnation\\".<br />If you are already a DM fan then just add it to your collection!
0451450523|5.0|Being an avid reader of Epic fantasy book series that stretch for thousands of pages, I have come to appreciate when a fantasy book can capture a truly unique story in just one book. An easy 200+ page read, and simply amazing for fantasy and non-fantasy enthusiasts alike. Some stories are beyond great, they're masterpieces; and this is truly one of the most uniques books amongst fantasy novels. (told through the eyes of a unicorn and the group she travels with).
B0060Q962Q|5.0|This is a very good strategy game and it is designed well.  The graphics are good and game play is fast and smooth.  I like how you can turn off the music and just have the sound effects.  It also features adjustable difficulty and changeable color schemes.<br /><br />We actually own the original game and have played it with our son and then with our grandchildren.  It is a lot of fun and you have to learn how to think ahead to win and be observant.<br /><br />The permissions use full Internet access and no others.  It can be a real time killer especially on the long road trips.  This is a good game!
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Didn't charge.  Didn't play my touch.  Didn't do anything.  Caveat Emptor on this, especially if you have a Bose Sounddock.  Also you have to jam the outlet into your touch, possibly causing damage to the device.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Pretty good. Had no trouble with the controls on Kindle fire. Good graphics. But not easy to win.<br />As a free apt it's fine
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have tried a few of these and this one works well. Only drawback is that it's not native RDP and does require a client to be running on the machine to be remote controlled. (not a big problem but something else to setup instead of just connecting)
B000002MY3|5.0|I used to have this album on cassette tape and I warped it out! lol I recently wanted to have it on CD and just could not find it in the store. Thank goodness for Amazon. This album is great.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I downloaded this as part of amazon's so-called free app a day but it still has ads. it's the same version I could have downloaded from the android market for free.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My daughter and I are addicts lol<br />Very cool game for the price!<br />there's some pretty tough spots in it. :p
B005K17RU0|3.0|And then it sort of drags you to Amazon and leaves you to puzzle out how to accomplish this. As best I can cipher, you gotta switch from mobile view to \\"view full site,\\" thus making everything pretty tiny -- by which time your opinion of this app may have dwindled. SO... the truth is that it's a fairly average weather app with first-rate graphics,and it contains just enough useful stuff to motivate you to spend for the premium version. I wound up putting a bookmark for weather underground on Dolphin, but you may as well download this as long as you've gotten this far. It's free and it works. :)
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I'm so torn on how to rate this one. I was so excited to read it, and I'm very glad I did. The writing in this book is beautiful, the imagination of Erin Morgenstern is astounding, and I never had to force myself to keep reading.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book was probably mismanaged expectations. The blurb for this book includes phrases like \\"fierce competition\\" and \\"deep, magical love\\" and I never saw any evidence of those elements in this book. Well, technically, I guess I saw evidence of the magical love because every time Celia and Marco touched, the lights flickered and glass broke, but none of that felt real to me. We never really saw them fall in love, they just met and announced that they were deeply in love.<br /><br />As for the \\"fierce competition\\", that was a completely misleading phrase. The competition took 16 years to get started and once it did start, it wasn't all that fierce. Most of the moves were made behind the scenes and only discussed later between the characters. There was no battle, no showdown.<br /><br />I think this book would probably be well-served by a second reading, which I'm looking forward to. And I'm definitely going to read what Morgenstern comes up with next. So I'm going with 3 stars because I really did like the book, but I think I was expecting something different based on the desriptions I've read.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Extremely durable and sturdy. I replaced the stock handle with a custom Micarta knife handle (BK77HNDL). I can't really add anything that most of the other reviewers have already said - I'm very happy with this purchase.  I uploaded a picture showing the knife with the new handle and forced patina.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|if you read how to play, you can win. it is a good game with good control. screw the Morons who have no patience for learning a new game. I won my first game and that's before I learner how to throw a curve ball!<br />I do however wish there was a skip option for computers turn, or two player mode.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|a few of the other people that rated this game said it's impossible to beat, that's false. i beat the computer twice in my first attempts at playing. the computer is fun to compete against cause its not too hard but not too easy either. i was on a bowling league when i was younger for a few years and this helps me have an affordable way to experience that same fun and challenging sport. it reminds me of the wii version but using your finger instead of a remote. great game, i recommend this to anyone that loves bowling :-)
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great app and version...... I would recommend it to any one that enjoys the classic PC Spider Solataire
B0071PS7AC|4.0|It's not the GREATEST game, but it's not as bad as other reviewers are making it out to be.  To roll the ball straight you have to pull back on the ball with ur finger then push forward and release. I played 5 games and beat the computer 3 of the times (the first 2 games were spent figuring it out). I wouldnt buy it, but its not bad for a free game.
B002GYS1FO|4.0|Not 100% amazing but for the songs that do stand out, it is totally worth the cash. It's nice to have the hard copies on my shelf so people can see what music I like with out spending the entire day scrolling around my ipod

1451627289|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan pretty much since he first started publishing books (yeah, shows how old I am). At one point, I stopped reading him because his writing started to get very generic. And then a few years back, he came out of retirement and started writing again. And let's just say that I've started becoming a King fan all over again.<br /><br />This book is definitely a departure from the usual King M.O. in that it's more of a science fiction novel than horror, yet throughout the novel there are King-ish moments that only a master of horror could possibly include. He takes us back to Derry (a town I will always know from the extremely creepy \\"It\\") but does it as by going back in time before all of the evil events took place. And then he casts a spell of including so many little references to his other works throughout the novel because his main character is literally living through time (shortly before the Kennedy assassination attempt).<br /><br />And then he brings us to a brilliantly researched tale through Lee Harvey Oswald's world as seen by someone who already knows what the man is going to do in a few short years. And then, because that would have been enough for any other great novelist, he creates a brilliant story for the protagonist who has to fit into the late 1950s, early 1960s in a small town in Texas where he build a relationship with a young woman who becomes a great focus for the story itself.<br /><br />Even to the very end, I still kept wondering what he was going to do to wrap it all up, and he does it amazingly. I'm not usually a 5 star reviewer but this is one of those rare books that I read all the way through and enjoyed almost every word. I know his next book brings us back to the Dark Tower series, but I'm probably going to take a break from King for awhile, happy that his last two books (this and Under the Dome) were well worth reading.
0767840135|5.0|This is one of the best Cirque shows and one of the best DVD productions of a Cirque show.  The story is classic and some of the best acts Cirque has to offer.  There are only a few moments that did not capture my attention and imagination.  The clowning sequences by John Gilkey are solid, imaginative and engaging. The clowning sequence by the three clowns midway through is standard \\"circus\\" type clowning - mildly funny but not too engaging.<br /><br />Highly recommend this show/DVD.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I especially enjoyed the characterizations in this novel. They were quintessentially Grisham - likeable, sympathetic and human. It was a great weekend read.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|This is a great DVD set of my favorite movie ever! This action packed movie is a must for every DVD collection, especially if you're a Tom cruise fan from his early years!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|When you first open the app there are no directions. Pull the ball straight back and release. I beat the computer on my 3rd &amp; 4th games.  193 on my 4th game. The higher weight of the ball and the farther back you pull the ball helps. You can pull back from the front of the ball as well.  That helps it move even faster.  I would suggest opening the game with directions for play.  It could be more challenging but overall not bad.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|A fantastic port from a childhood game into a handheld one. Runs extraordinarily smooth and music is mutable!! Also no crazy permissions so all in all free or not I would indubitably recommend to pick this one up. Great for two people to do while sitting around or out at a buffet somewhere.
0451197968|4.0|This shouldn't be taken the wrong way, but one of this book's best virtues is that it is short.  King knew the idea was not developed enough to drag it out any further.  It was 230 pages or so, and that was the longest it could be, at this stage of development, to maintain meaning and interest the whole way through.<br /><br />It is a very good idea, but I got the feeling it was something King came up with quite early in his writing career, then released later without really going over it again through the lens of several more years of top-level writing experience.  A bit of tinkering here and there, shaving off or rerouting some areas where the behavior was slightly unrealistic or unjustified, could have really made this a truly great novel.<br /><br />At any rate, it is a worthwhile read.  As with Jaws, those who adapted it into a screenplay did a pretty good job of focusing on the important throughline and reworking things for the pace and punctuation of film.<br /><br />I would be really interested in reading a full length novel if King ever decided to go back to this one and really flesh it out as a truly mature writer.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This App is amazing! I love to use it when I'm bored! One of the best apps I have ever bought! I recommend this to everyone!! I cant wait till my son is old enough to use this, I'm sure he will enjoy it too lol!
B006470HZ6|1.0|I enjoyed season 1 and had high expectations for season 2. After sitting through half of the episodes so far i find myself laughing, crying and gesticulating at the TV but NOT in a way that's good. Why? The characters are terrible. You would think with all the time they spend talking to each other in forced dialogues they would be more interesting but you care about them less and less.<br /><br />The story doesn't move anywhere. Plot lines  get dragged out for episodes when they could be settled much quicker. Characters behave in haphazard, nonsensical ways. This of course leads to, you guessed it - more pointless ridiculous dialogue.<br /><br />The world they live in makes no sense? why is the Farm so safe..there's never been any exploration of the zombies or what they are or do except that they grunt and snarl and pop up here and there . If they roam about the vicinity of the farm why does everyone walk around like there is no danger? There's no sense that they live in a world that has changed or any interest on their part in understanding it. The zombies just exist in the background.<br /><br />This show has been 'Wrong' since the first episode of Season 2 and since nothing really happens its incorrect to say that it's spiraling downhill - it's kind of like a zombie itself lurching around, reeking and dead for a while.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it easy to work through, I love the easy way to switch translation and other tools. I total love using the highlights and the different colors .
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app is awful. Almost never works on my Kindle Fire. I am sooo lucky it was free or I'd be even more ticked about the quality.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|I like games that I can play with my significant other or child while in the waiting room. Fancy graphics are not necessary for this genre. I wouldn't play against the computer; there plenty of more challenging games to amuse me.<br /><br />**Worked fine on the Toshiba Thrive.
1439192812|5.0|The appearance of this book in our world is truly a magic. I am dreaming about a world in future where all children and teenagers will be able to look at the world scientifically and besides, by discovering its magic, build it more enthusiastically, free from boundaries of blind faith. Thank you Great Richard!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|beautiful app...challenging and superbly designed. great soundtrack! gets harder as you go but advanced levels are doable in time. Earn as many hints as you can on the easy levels.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|This recordings of Metallica are really cool!Every fan of this band must have this EP,because it will became one of their big classics.Metallica there is no a lot of EPs!!!The songs inside has a long time running,they are four but it's like seven maybe eight :))))!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a pretty cool way to keep yourself busy for a few minutes. The more points you get the more games you can play. If you run out of points you can always go back to the games your good at to get more.
0307269752|5.0|No matter how much I enjoy the films, reading the books puts you right in the head of the characters in the story. This was actually a surprise gift for my girlfriend and she's loves it. I'll be looking to purchase the remaining 2 books of this series in the future.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app would be 5 stars if I could buy a paid version with no ads.  I use it on the Fire and my Ipod.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|Can't wait to play this with my grandson! We loved the hands on game when he was 5-7 and I'm sure we will love this one especially on camping trips.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|This movie was a great movie in general but also for kids too!  It is fun for family and a good night in.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|I have to give kudos to this developer for not including any useless permissions! Some games ask for your contact lists and everything else! The game itself is just so-so, but if we give bad devs 1 star for excessive permissions I like to reward devs that don't use any.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I waited before posting a review until i listened to this cd a few times.I try not to have any preconceived expectations about new music from any artist so that i can listen without any biased opinion no matter how much i like said artist.And i must say that this album truly ROCKS!! It has not left my player since it's release.This picks up right where 1984 left off although it's closer in style to WACF and FW.Every track is a winner.Nothing to skip here.Yes,i even love \\"Tattoo\\" and think that it get's a bad rap even from true VH fans.And i for one have no issues with Dave's singing on this. Hell, it's Dave! Sounds like he always has to me just a little closer to his late solo period is all,and nothing wrong with that! I can't understand all the negativity about the way he sings unless either your a new fan and it's just not your thing or you can't get over the Sammy era.Its always been this way with Roth! So if your an older fan why the about face all of a sudden?! I have been a VH fan since their second album and even followed them through the Hagar years who i am a fan of also and i can gladly say that this is an album that VH and their fans can be proud of! Way to go guys!!
B004EPZ07K|3.0|GREEN LANTERN is actually a good movie until its last act...no spoilers here, but the elaborate build-up, the solid characterisations and spectacular special effects which are definitely blockbuster-worthy, just fall short in the build-up to the battle royale. Kind of how the Fantastic Four dropped the bomb with Galactus in another movie - the movie's scriptwriters present an uninteresting, unscary alien villain for Green Lantern to fight.  Parallax is well rendered visually, but he's kinda like a floating tree trunk.  Somehow intergalactic bad doesn't play so well when most of the movie actually works really well on a more down-to-earth intimate level.<br /><br />I really think Hollywood's forgotten just how to craft and create good villains that will keep audiences on the edge of the seats.  The thing was, I was watching the show and trying to figure out why an overwhelming majority gave it a bad review and then - as the last half hour played out, I understood.  I will say it again - the effects are great and this is probably exactly how Green Lantern should have been styled and brought to life.  It's a visual masterpiece just about, and hopefully with a round 2 on the way - the filmmakers will get it right.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively make a great couple onscreen - but so much more could have been done in the scripting department to heighten the stakes - yes, we have an alien who wants to destroy our planet, but just how, why and huh?  Blake Lively floating in the air with a needle pointed at her neck (ok a spoiler) - doesn't quite make me shake in my seat.  Martin Campbell is a capable director but he probably needs to take a page out of his own James Bond films or dissect a disaster film (which this ends up as a poor derivative of)....it seemed to skip a few scenes and suddenly we were at an inexplicable end.  Watch Star Wars and the Death Star sequence again - that was what this film needed.<br /><br />Good luck with the sequel!!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I just downloaded this app and have played all of five games. I won two out of the five, so keeps me playing! Seems some of the lower rating reviewed are playing on their phones. I don't think I would like it as much on a small screen, but it's pretty good on the Kindle Fire.
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|When I first heard all the hype around this album and how it was going to be one of his angriest and politically pointed albums ever, I was very excited. I thought that was what made Bruce's 70's output so great. His great lyrics and raw rock power really made me love that stuff. So did this live up to all of that hype?<br /><br /> In a word... no. I will say it is his best output since The Rising but that isn't saying much. He really hasn't made a great album since Born In The USA. I do appreciate and respect the attempt to incorporate many styles of music into what he is doing but it just doesn't quite work for me. Don't get me wrong, it is a decent album but my expectations were just set way too high by all the hype.<br /><br />I also have to say that the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is a little bit of a joke too. For someone who is complaining about the economy and politics and how you should buy from independent record stores he sure doesn't give much value for the extra $2 or $3 here. He gives just 2 extra songs and bigger packaging that won't fit into my CD rack. Most deluxe editions at least throw in a documentary of the making of the album or maybe some live performances of the songs on video.<br /><br />This is the best output Bruce has given us in a long time but it lacks the edge that made his earlier work so great. I unfortunately think those days are gone forever from Bruce, too bad.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|I find the music to be tired and out of touch. Bruce speaks about the working man and all his problems as if it is forty years ago instead of now. He speaks of the banker getting fat while the working man gets thin. It sppears that Bruce is one of the fat cats and he is out of touch with the working people that made him famous and inspired him for so many years. As a life long fan. I believe it is time for him to get back to his roots and perhaps talk to the people he seems to champion. Sorry, but this ain't 1980. I see no spark or \\"anger\\" as many have attested to, only an artist that wants to make more money while doling out nothing extraordinary. I give it a two only because it's Bruce.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I love the Game of Thrones and eagerly await the ability to watch this on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, Amazon.com's pre-order is TERRIBLE! I pre-ordered this weeks before release, and was hoping to receive it on release day. I understand that isn't always possible, so it'd be fine if it was at least SHIPPED on the release date. NOPE! Amazon is telling me that I may not receive the Blu-Ray until at least March 13th! I hope it ships some day soon, as my order is still listed as not yet shipped! I DIDN'T PREORDER THIS SO I COULD RECEIVE IT A WEEK AFTER RELEASE!!! Unreal. WARNING: DO NOT PRE-ORDER FROM AMAZON, YOU MAY HAVE MY EXPERIENCE AS WELL.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Once you learn the easy controls it's pretty fun.  My sixth game was 215 with a 246 two games later.  Pull the ball back, move it all the way to the side to get it revving, move it back to the middle area, line it up and let it go, kind of like a slingshot.  No need to flick it forward like other games.  Bowlers use your arrows and its a piece of cake.  Other than crazy splits, spares are cake also.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always loved this game. Every time I have a lot going on or thinking way too much solitaire usually helps me focus on just the tactics of the game and nothing else. it truly helps me to just relax and go back to my thoughts and concerns at a later time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app does have some pretty fun games but with the ads popping up literally after every game it's hard to fully enjoy the app. I know the ads are how it stays free but it's an obnoxious amount.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|reposted from my blog: [...]<br /><br />A few weeks back, I ranted a bit (okay, a lot), about the absence of aspirational heroes in Middle-Grade fiction these days. For the most part, I'm still feeling tantram-y about the general state of things in this regard.<br /><br />HOWEVER--<br /><br />WONDER, by R.J. Palacio , goes a long way to correct this.<br /><br />Let's face it: there are books and then, there are BOOKS! And, by the latter category, I mean those rare gems that not only captivate us but also change us--for the better--by us having had the good fortune to have read them.<br /><br />WONDER is such a wonder. It tilted my obit, just a touch, and here's why:<br /><br />The story is about Auggie, a normal kid with a horrifying facial deformity. Yes, I said *deformity* although, like everyone else in the story, the impact of that word diminishes for the reader as we, too, get to know this remarkable little man.<br /><br />The story unfolds through the eyes of first, Auggie, then in sections devoted to the people who know and love him. It's a study in perspective---how each character views and copes with the daunting challenges of everyday life when you're always the center of unwanted, and sometimes hostile, attention.<br /><br />The writing is sublime perfection. Simple, and yet, so, so powerful. Palacio's voice carries the sophisticated eloquence needed to lift such a melancholy story into the realm of inspiration.<br /><br />One of my favorite passages:<br /><br />\\"Why do I have to be so ugly, Mommy?\\" I whispered.<br />\\"No, baby, you're not...\\"<br />\\"I know I am.\\"<br />She kissed me all over my face. She kissed my eyes that came down too far. She kissed my cheeks that looked punched in. She kissed my tortoise mouth. She said soft words that I know were meant to help me, but words can't change my face.\\"<br /><br />My heart aches, just typing that.<br /><br />There is so much wisdom in this book. I'm in no way surprised that so many have plucked pearls from its text. I am particularly fond of this one:<br /><br />\\"I think that there should be rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.\\"<br /><br />Wouldn't we all be better people if we gave more of those and received at least one?<br /><br />Read this book. You'll be grateful you did.d should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.\\"    Wouldn't we all be better people if we gave more of those and received at least one?    Read this book. You'll be grateful you did.
B00196YNWU|1.0|This 1982 movie version is far from the 1977 musical and Broadway classic. If you want to see a version with songs and plot line more true to the Broadway musical, buy (or rent) the 1999 version produced by Disney.

B00005N6KG|1.0|The sound comes in and out and is full of static.  I use these for work, and they are such poor quality.  I would never purchase these again and if I could get a hold of the seller to return them, I would.
0375869026|5.0|This is the one book I will be recommending to my children, their friends and to their teachers as well. It's such a lovely book and easy to read as well. I first heard of this book on Entertainment Weekly as one of their Top 10 of the week. I don't always agree with their reviews or selections, but this time, they hit it on the nose.<br /><br />This is an absolutely beautiful book and definitely, my sons can relate to it since they both wear hearing aids (the description of Auggie not wanting to wear hearing aids is exactly how my sons feel ... but they do it because they want to hear). I have one of my nine-year-olds reading it this week and hopefully, his twin will read it soon because it's such a wonderful book, perfect for their age level and yet, not dumbed down either. They're going through a lot of the same issues that Auggie faced in this book and it's just heart-warming to see people looking past his deformities to the real person inside.<br /><br />Auggie (August) is a ten-year-old entering middle school for the first time since he had been home-schooled his entire life due to the numerous surgeries and treatments he has had since birth. He was born with birth defects that made his features look abnormal and just not in a small way either. It was obvious, in your face kind of way and while Auggie grew up surrounded by his parents' love, he never really had a lot of friends. He entered middle school and that first year was filled with surprises, not all bad and not all great. It's a perfect coming-of-age story set in what I consider to be the most horrendous years of schooling ...<br /><br />There are several voices in this book as well and I loved reading the different perspectives from people in Auggie's life, coming from Summer and Jack, his friends, and his sister and her friends. It's a neat way to get different viewpoints from different people who knew Auggie all of his life or just met him and saw past the ugly exterior to find the kind soul that lurks beneath his face.<br /><br />As an adult, I might have expected a more meatier story-line because that is what I am used to reading but this is perfect for kids who are interested in broadening their reading horizons and this will get them to hopefully start talking, especially about bullies and making friends in the murky years of tween years. It is a perfect book for parents to share with their kids and that is what I am trying to do with my own.<br /><br />It is definitely one of my favorite reads of this year!<br /><br />3/7/12

B005EGXTHG|3.0|This book was compelling, and easy to read.<br />however, I found it rushed, and alot of the things that happened didnt seem realistic.<br />the characters descisions, and choises made no sense in alot of parts.<br /><br />The first book was much better than this one. But. Still, I read it all, and wanted to read more.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased this case for a kindle fire. It doesn't seem like it would stand up, but the weight of the kindle supports it standing up. One complaint is that the part that touches your kindle screen  is the part that supports it standing up. It would be a good idea to invest in a screen protector.<br />Other then that, love this case.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|But gets boring after a while but good for entertaining others or something like that I hope u found this a lil bit helpful.
1869509277|4.0|You can purchase this book is some NewZealand stores and save carrying it with your luggage.  I saw it at the airport.  It was good at orienting you to where different scenes were shot.  A head's up: Many places were used for background, while the action was shot in a studio or created on a computer.  Also, many scenes in the movie feature scenes shot all over new zealand and since they are together in the movie you assume they are also together in real life.  Example: when arwen rides away from the nazgul, the horse scene (shot with a double by the way) is in one area, the river she enters in another area, and the when she turns to face the nazgul, that river is yet somewhere else.  I highly recommend the area around queenstown and glenorche.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is one of the best bibble app I have used yet I think you should use this bubble app.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I was looking for something to replace my Datebook6 Calendar that I used to use on my Palm device. I thought I would have to compromise and give up a lot. I didn't. This is an incredibly useful app which is highly customizable. There are a number of different views in each category (weekly, monthly, etc), you can change the color of both the text and the background to make things stand out as much, or as little, as you want. It is very easy to add new events or tasks, and is very intuitive. I would highly recommend this app. I would also recommend that once you get it, you play around with the settings to make it exactly what you want it to be, because you can!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|If this movie got you feeling something for Caesar or thinking about what's called \\"great ape personhood,\\" I highly recommend a book called [[ASIN:0380728222 Next of Kin: My Conversations with Chimpanzees]], from which I suspect this movie drew at least in part. It's the story of Washoe and her son Loulis. Washoe is a famous chimpanzee who learned 350 signs of ASL, taught 70 of them to her son Loulis, and was observed creating novel expressions, including some that asserted a certain emotionality. [[ASIN:B000FILVNW Koko: A Talking Gorilla]] is also a classic of the genre. Experiencing this movie again with these two documents in your back pocket will be a whole different experience.<br /><br />Hail Caesar!

0312576463|1.0|I had a visceral response to Freedom, and I didn't like it. This is the only Jonathan Franzen book that I have attempted to read.  I completed about 2/3 of the book hoping that something would pop out to explain all the praise, but it didn't. The author displays no empathy for the characters of Freedom. He gives a seemingly neutral account of the various family members behaving badly.  He conveys the negative characteristics of self interest, hypocrisy and, for want of a better word, smugness.  The emotional realm is simple.  Family members are basically pleased or displeased, angry or serene, and miserable or happy.<br /><br />Is it news that people behave badly, and do cruel things to each other?  Freedom could be a very clever portrayal of a raconteur who is unable to relate to humanity, but I am inclined to think that, at least while writing this book, Jonathan Franzen's vision was handicapped.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|...because it was lame.<br /><br /> It is pretty boring if you ask me. There are just some games that can't be made into a game on a Kindle and this is one of the.
B000002VCQ|3.0|Whitney Houston burst onto the music scene in 1985 with her self-titled debut album.  The album ended up spending fourteen weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 charts and spawned four top ten pop singles, three of which went all the way to number.  There is no denying the power of Ms. Houston's voice.  Honed for years singing in the church, it is a mighty instrument.  For someone who was just 22 at the time of the release, she had the poise and stature of someone who spent years in the business.  The singles standout as the best songs on the album with \\"How Will I Know\\" ranking as one her best songs and one of the catchiest songs from '85-'86.  There a couple of duets with Jermaine Jackson and one with Teddy Pendergrass (\\"Take Good Care of My Heart\\" originally appeared on Jermaine Jackson's self-titled 1984 album - \\"Hold Me\\" originally appeared on  Teddy's 1984 Love Language album and was Ms. Houston's first charting single).  Some of the album cuts are perfunctory sounding R&B numbers, but the power of Ms. Houston's voice is on full display.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce's latest State of the Union is incredibly timely and speaks directly to the times we are living in.  His message of economic populism is an important one that more people need to hear.  The Boss balances anger and frustration with just enough gritty optimism.  Message aside -- Wrecking Ball is just pure fun to listen to.  The variety of styles makes this his freshest sounding album in a very long time.  Even if you're not too interested in the message, you won't be disappointed with the music.  Turn it up loud!<br /><br />Highlights: Easy Money, Shackled and Drawn, Death To My Hometown, Wrecking Ball<br />Overall: 4.5/5
B005K0HDGE|2.0|how this book got such good reviews is very very puzzling to me.  i'll start by saying King is/was pure genius.  is that he still has ideas of incredible stories, was that he no longer either has the ability or cares to put the effort into translating those ideas to the truly life changing epics that he once did with regularity..like It, The Stand, the shining, the shawshank redemption and so on.  i was suckered in yet again and i'm afraid to say for the last time with 11/22/63.  i mean what an absolutely awesome premise.  after reading the jacket i finally thought, at last he's going back to his roots, and immediately purchased the hard cover as it just had to be another classic.  was i wrong, do none of you remember the way this man used to write?  he truly made it look easy.  i knew something was wrong after the first 200 pages.  i read The Stand in 3 days and even took a day off from work as i simply could not put it down.  we could hardly pick this one up.  the whole club felt that way.  we took what seemed like an eternity to finish this, 3 weeks.  i'm sorry but this was just plain boring.  with all he had at his disposal from the idea itself i felt he just didnt have the will/desire to really go for it.  in the end we all were left wanting. not more but rather the end  it was nothing more than another of his short stories that he somehownmanaged to turn into 900 pages.  with the worst payoff ending since cujo.  never again, never again.  i gave it 2 stars simply out of respect for a true living legend
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find this app easy to use and simple . Whoo hoo! Just typing random words so I can submit.

B003O86FMW|5.0|the ending gives you a lot to take in, can't wait to start book 3!! i was a little surprized to see them go back into the hunger games & didn't like the ideal all that well but it was for sure WAY different than the first book & the ending has an awesome cliff hanger, that is why i gave it 5 stars & not 4 because it kept me wanting more & more & the end will not disapoint!!! enjoy
B0060Q962Q|2.0|so why would you play it more than once? and you can't play against someone on the Web,  so why is so so so big in size and who needs this game.  got bored and will uninstall.
0060853972|4.0|Other reviews have described this book well. I'll add only that the Horsepersons' exploits are all too vivid and believable, as are the means by which they (almost) extinguish life on earth. Now I can't hear a news story without thinking about how they could have orchestrated it, though I alone seem to have this obsession. I know they're as fictitious as the other characters, but the world would make a lot more sense if they weren't.<br /><br />The humor is also more esoteric than in the Discworld books; many biblical or 1980s-England references were probably lost on me. But it's full of the nonstop randomness and astute commentary at which Pratchett excels, with Gaiman adding a grimmer edge.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|having a lot of fun playing. great variety of games offered. my daughter loves the sushi game most. thanks for the fun
B005TPCQ5I|1.0|Too long and monotonous with a shocking ending. I didn't like it and would not recommend it. Usually I love this type of movie, but I didn't even ask my husband to watch it again with me.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|Nice thick plastic, clicks closed and stays closed, wipes stay moist and will hook to almost anything.<br /><br />Great for hanging off the toilet paper roll holder in the bathroom for potty training toddlers!<br />You can open it one handed... closing tight usually requires two.<br /><br />Downside: I can see my daughter learning how to open this and rip the wipes all out quite quickly... but it never claimed to be toddler proof!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a standard weather app but the kindle fire limits it without location options.the app is great though. very classice icons and pictures

B0016492BW|5.0|My review is for the blu-ray version which I pre-ordered and it arrived today.  I watched it with my 12 year old who had seen bits of the movie on you tube.  Wow, first time in my life where the movie looked clear.  It looks as good as a modern SD movie, maybe a little better and at times looks HD.  The colors are much better and the sound is a lot better.  I did have the disk freeze twice I hope this isn't a regular problem.  We haven't explored much into the special features yet.
B002UM5BXW|2.0|Anthony Bourdain is a talented  chef.  He's also a kitchen pig.  If you can get passed the cigs, sex, and old food sent out as the 'special of the day', there is some merit.  If you can't stand watching his 'No Resevations\\" on TV this isn't a book you will enjoy.  Really, not worth the $7 I paid for it.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|DO NOT get this app!!! It sucks! I got it for my kindle fire thinking it would be a fun little game to play when I'm bored. Well its not fun and it just plain sucks! Even though I tried it for free it was a waste of my time.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I bought this set from Amazon UK and the price was about half of what you expect to pay for the US release. The discs themselves have the same pictures as it's US counterpart, but without the large titles (there are smaller titles on the edge), which can be a slight pain, but doesn't really take too long to figure out as they are all in order. For me, the content is the most important factor not a pretty cardboard box so I felt pretty good about saving $40 for having exactly the same edition.<br />First time I have seen the Richard Donner cut of Superman and was really surprised at how much different it was to the Richard Lester version. Picture quality throughout is top notch, even Superman IV, which still is a bit of a stinker after not seeing for years!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I also lost all of my progress when I did the update. There should have been some type of warning or something. still play it to pass the time. kids love the variety.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|Unfortunately for Bruce and the rest of the aging artists of the 60's and 70's (Neil Young, Brian Wilson, Van Morrison, Mike Oldfield, The Rolling Stones, etc)., the inspiration that once made them great has evaporated into the ether.<br /><br />Maybe he is simply aging, too comfortable or the well has simply run dry, there is nothing on this quasi folk offering that seems real, authentic or based on his own life.<br /><br />Where is the lyrical brilliance, and dark weight of hopelessness like  \\"The River\\"?<br /><br />The inspired instrumentation and sparse 'late at night' feel of \\"Meeting Across The River\\" (you can almost feel the cold wind blowing through the city as two friends walk down a urban canyon talking).<br /><br />The raucous exuberance of \\"Rosalita\\"?<br /><br />The poetry and pop brilliance of \\"Tunnel of Love\\" as he faces commitment and marriage with apprehension and wonder?<br /><br />The brokenhearted and chilling loss of \\"Paradise\\"?<br /><br />The rocking passion and outrage of \\"Last To Die?\\"<br /><br />Good intentions do not equate great art. I am giving \\"Wrecking Ball\\" two stars because he is Bruce and because he is the greatest rock/pop recording artist of the past 40 years, perhaps ever.<br /><br />But if this was his first recording no one would ever know who Bruce Springsteen was. Jon Landau was right, but that was 40 years ago.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|The games I got are just ok. Then you have to purchase more games with coins you earn, or purchase coins. And when you you purchase a game with earned coins,  you don't know what the game will be like. Bummer. I'm going to uninstall the whole thing.
3836503050|5.0|Ver informative book about Gil Elvgren before he even published his own work and after he became very famous.  It also talks about other famous artists before and after Elvgren's era!

B006UKC566|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages. I seen it in the movies in 3D and loved it. I couldn't wait to add it to my collection. [[ASIN:B004LWZW8S Immortals [Blu-ray]]]
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|My wife and I and my best friend in the world got to see Rush two times in 2011, the Time Machine Tour.

I highly reccomend this DVD, Snakes and Arrows to any Rush fan, you will not be disappointed!!!

0345528581|5.0|I really like this book for several reasons:<br /><br />It fits perfectly with my own experience - muscles that take longer to develop are stronger, leaner, have greater endurance and last longer than muscles that are developed quickly using large weights.  At an hour aerobics class at the air force gym, I easily out-did young, big-muscled airmen -- and I was over 30 and 6 months pregnant!<br /><br />The book provides clear, easy to follow instructions and illustrations.  The exercises are simple and can be done anywhere and without expensive gear.  And there are lots of exercises to choose from!  The benefits of the specific exercises are also covered.<br /><br />Another definite plus to the book is that it relies on its content rather than using sex to make sales.  To me, that says the content is high quality and can stand on its own and shows the author has integrity.<br /><br />I've shared this book with others and highly recommend it!
B004EPZ06G|4.0|The Hangover partII is not good as part 1.It was a little boring to me, but it did have some funny parts.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|Drive nailed my nostalgia g-dot. A great cast and performances, great direction, editing, music. The film left me with an overall positive impression that soaked mah drawas and had me thinking about it during the weeks following. I would caution that folks looking for an all-out action flick will be disappointed if they're an idiot. If you have trouble sitting still or chase bugs on a whim, stay away.

1594203334|3.0|It seems to me that what this author is advocating is a return to the way parenting used to be done, particularly with how Gen X was raised (i.e., parents doing their own thing, finding themselves, divorcing, etc., while the kids were more or less left to fend for themselves.) It sounds to me also like there is a good old fashioned authoritarian bent to this so-called enlightened way of childrearing. I give it three stars anyway, because I'm always in favor of people at least giving some thought to how they are raising their kids, and writing a book about it is no easy endeavor.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|I give this album four and one-half stars just for song \\"Trans Europe Express.\\" If you're into the German side of life, you know expressionism, nihilism, existentialism and noir, then this is going to be your jam. It's very cold and mechanical music, and it's only going to engage certain people - you know who you are! Lovers of Bowie's Berlin Trilogy (Low, Heroes and Lodger) and also Eno's work would be the perfect audience for this.<br /><br />The title track strongly conveys the feeling of riding this \\"bullet train\\" and what a gas to be actually listening to this, zooming through the German countryside, while knocking back some seriously potent dunkel. One can only dream.  For reference, the Trans Europe Express was a maze of 45 different train lines connecting 130 major cities throughout Europe.  \\"All trains were first-class-only and required payment of a special supplement over the normal first-class ticket price, the amount of which depended on the distance covered.\\" - Wikipedia.  Only a few of the these trains are still in operation, however.<br /><br />I bought this when it first came out on vinyl - actually I think I have the EP (extended play) version. That cover was pretty cool - red, black and white graphics. But the cover of this CD is really tacky, or maybe it's a total come on?

For some, the unthinkable can be too difficult to bear and so the imagination, reason, and faith come to the rescue. This is the reality for the  challenged young hero of this book.<br />He is a fascinating lad who was part survivor, part spiritualist, and part dreamer.

B00271SFB6|5.0|I rented this from Amazon in HD.  I am confused since I also paid for every episode of season 4 of Breaking Bad and now \\"own\\" those episodes for all time. I can watch them from now until eternity.  But this rental was for only a 24 hour window and then it disappears and you will need to pay another $3.99 for HD again.  I only had one complaint about watching the movie - one cannot fast forward, or rewind (I don't now how), and there was a glitch about the bandwidth which came out of nowhere twice.  It was strange since we have plenty of bandwidth and it we checked and nobody else in the house (on our network) was on the Internet, so I don't know what that was all about but the screen froze, a message came on, we clicked on a button and Viola! the movie started playing again.  Overall, I think it is a good bargain compared to verizon FIOS rentals (they are available for 48 hrs I think) but cost more. Recommend!
0062011847|1.0|Like many others, I'm a huge fan, having read practically everything Pratchett has written. The downward slope for me started with Unseen Academicals, which was so clunky and awkwardly written, that it took me a long time to read (normally, I can get through a good Discworld novel in a matter of hours).<br />Fine.<br />Snuff is unreadable. It is rambling, abruptly starting and ending scenes, characters are flat and unlikable and it is the first Terry Pratchett book I have been unable to finish reading. I started when it was first published and three months down the line and 120-odd torturous pages later I gave up.<br />Go, re-read his great old stuff, buy a copy of Guard, Guards for a friend, but leave this one alone.

0375869026|5.0|August (Auggie) Pullman was born with severe and life-threatening craniofacial abnormalities. After a young lifetime of wall-to-wall corrective surgeries, he still stops people dead in their tracks when they first encounter his visage.<br /><br />And now ten year-old Auggie Pullman, who has been kept relatively protected -- living in a New York City neighborhood where he is a known quantity, and being homeschooled by his mother -- is attending a real school for the first time. It is a private middle school to which his parents submitted an application without telling him first.<br /><br />WONDER took me by surprise. I've read enough stories about the outsider in middle school, so there are some things you come to expect. But what I did not expect was for the story to really take off a quarter of the way through when the point of view suddenly switches to that of Olivia, arguably the book's pivotal character. \\"Via\\" is Auggie's high school-aged sister, and she had once upon a time been a doted-upon first child and first grandchild until Auggie was born and immediately sucked up all the oxygen in the room with his medical issues.<br /><br />Then, further on, when I thought we would once again return to Auggie's perspective, we instead move on to the points of view of a series of other young characters who have become part of Auggie's story and have their own relationships with him and their own takes on and his situation.<br /><br />Sure, there are lots and lots of stories with multiple perspectives. But I am really impressed by the power brought to this story through the use of the format and through the respect that the author shows for her middle school audience in probing the honest and sometimes complex and sometimes unpretty emotions inside the story's young and adult characters.<br /><br />\\"her parents couldn't be nicer. put me at ease right away. the waiter brings over the menus and i notice his expression the moment he lays eyes on august. but i pretend not to notice. i guess we're all pretending not to notice things tonight. the waiter. my tics. the way august crushes tortilla chips on the table and spoons the crumbs into his mouth. i look at olivia and she smiles at me. she knows. she sees the waiter's face. she sees my tics. olivia is a girl who sees everything.\\"<br /><br />As I've previously pointed out, when I've written about other stories involving name-calling and intolerance, middle schoolers learning about acceptance amongst one another can oftentimes serve as THE pivotal step in their growing up with a predisposition toward accepting those individuals and groups from outside one's own community, religion, race, sexual orientation, and country. Thus, WONDER is both a great and an important story. The Schneider Family Book Award people will no doubt be giving this one a long look.notice. i guess we're all pretending not to notice things tonight. the waiter. my tics. the way august crushes tortilla chips on the table and spoons the crumbs into his mouth. i look at olivia and she smiles at me. she knows. she sees the waiter's face. she sees my tics. olivia is a girl who sees everything.\\"<br /><br />As I've previously pointed out, when I've written about other stories involving name-calling and intolerance, middle schoolers learning about acceptance amongst one another can oftentimes serve as THE pivotal step in their growing up with a predisposition toward accepting those individuals and groups from outside one's own community, religion, race, sexual orientation, and country.

0143038419|3.0|Reading this books reminds me of another excellent book that I've read, \\"The Power of Now\\" by Echardt Tolle.  There's a striking similarity particularly the mediatation part (and I often wondered whether Ms. Gilbert have read it or not). I hate to compare the two but the message in the book by Tolle revolves around the Present, the Now; not the past, not the future.  In Ms Gilbert's book, Eat, Pray, Love:  On the Pray part, the essence is about controlling your thought. You have the choice to chose your thoughts, to unwelcome any negativity to enter your mind and not to harbor any of it in your heart.  If I haven't read The Power of Now, I would have given this book a 5-star, but the other one is much more powerful.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|Well, that was 1 hour and 38 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Sparse dialogue can be a good thing, here its just dead space. Could easily put this movie into 40 minutes and still be boring. The soundtrack wanted to be like A Clockwork Orange modernized. How does a diner scene with the love interest translate to suspenseful background music? Doesn't make sense really. The cinematography was dark, intentional I understand, but it just made the empty movie feel that much more vapid. Do yourself a favor and skip this one please. Or how about a deal? If the first 20 minutes bore the heck out of you, bail on it, it doesn't get better only more of the same. If you like it, well, have fun with that. Ick.

I'm talking about the burdens in life.  One thing I like the most is when he touched base on what give's us pain, which according to buddhism, it's the desire the we set to ourselves.... And we need to cut that desire to set us free. There's also the meditation process that he talked about and how to concentrate on the NOW, rather than the past or the future. This Now, will never come again.  Read this book, and it will set you Free!

1451683405|2.0|Sam Harris exploded onto the scene with the stunningly lucid and urgent \\"The End of Faith\\", which has become a modern classic and remains the very best of the stupidly-titled \\"New Atheist\\" genre.  While Sam's assorted essays and public appearances in the following years remained(and remain) a delight to read, my own personal enthusiasm for him plummeted after the shockingly bad exhibition of pedestrian and often times just plain nonsensical philosophy exhibited in The Moral Landscape, in which Harris apparently felt that dangling the talisman of neuroscience magically solved the quandaries that have plagued the pursuit of \\"objective\\" ethics for centuries.  The professional reviews were pulverizing and Harris' response to them thus far has been very inadequate. Would Free Will continue the foray into oblivion or signal the return of the author who composed the brilliant The End of Faith?<br /><br />To someone who hasn't given much thought to this issue previously, there is much provocative material to be had here.  Especially relieving is that Sam's neuroscientific findings/observations are indeed very relevant and illuminating within this particular debate, unlike in TML.  Indeed, upon finishing the opening chapters, it's very hard to conceive of a cogent argument for the existence of Free Will in light of the philosophical and,now, thanks to neuroscience, empirical arguments against the concept.  What's rather disappointing, however, is that Harris' acknowledges that his friend Daniel Dennett is a proponent of compatibalism, but is then very, very cursory in his treatment and dismissal of that school of thought; if you don't know anything about compatibalism before you read this book, you won't know much more about it after you finish this book.  Yes, I am aware of how similar this sounds to the ridiculous canard that New Atheists don't even engage with \\"authentic\\" or \\"sophisticated\\" theology, however I don't think that's an exact parallel.  Certainly atheists areright to point out that filling in gaps in our understanding of the universe with theology is untenable, however \\"sophisticated\\" it is.  But here Harris seems to be arguing that the \\"gap\\" in our human understanding of consciousness forever unbridgeable. He shrewdly points out that it's hard to even conceive in principle of what \\"free will\\" might entail, but even conceding that, it's not entirely convincing.  What's also noteworthy is that Dennett himself is a very able philosopher who often delights in excoriating vacuous philosophical arguments.  If even Dennett subscribes to compatibalism, surely it is on more substantive grounds than Harris presents in this book.<br /><br />The main problem I have with this work is the treatment of reconciling the lack of free will with an internally coherent way of punishing criminals.  Harris' argument is flawed on many levels.  First, his argument that stewards of people's neurological states could be held accountable for not \\"treating\\" the would-be criminal does not solve the fundamental problem, it merely shifts the moral culpability to another agent, who in turn ALSO HAS NO FREE WILL.  i.e, in Harris' argument, a doctor who withheld a cure for \\"evil\\"--a rather facile scenario--has committed a moral failing, so who is to be held responsible for that? This merely creates an infinite regress.  Even if we were to concede that such a form of punitive justice would be internally coherent, which it isn't, actually applying would raise some very real fascist implications.  Eliding this was a huge problem with The Moral Landscape and unfortunately rears its head again here.<br /><br />(There is a very interesting episode of the television program \\"House\\" that deals with the question of culpability.  In it, a convicted triple murderer on death row is found to have a \\"pheo\\"; a tumor that randomly releases shots of adrenaline which can cause fits of rage.  After discovering this, Dr. Foreman decides to testify at a hearing in favor reducing or ending the patient's prison sentence.  House agrees that Dr. Foreman can do this on his own time and that the argument has some merit, but also urges him to keep in mind \\"all those other pheo sufferers<br />who managed to control their rage attacks and become lawyers, race car drivers, and even doctors.\\" This episode is the Season 2 premiere entitled \\"Acceptance\\")<br /><br />Harris' dismissal of the illusion of free will being essential for happiness is far too cursory, as it is constituted entirely merely of Sam's personal feelings about not having free will.  Certainly there are others who share his viewpoint, but I personally become very depressed when I let myself get on a long train of reductionist thought.  Certainly others feel this way, too; this subject deserved more than simply Harris' own personal anecdote.<br /><br />Finally, while this work hasn't been published before in the traditional sense, for an avid reader of Harris' blog and assorted essays very little of the material is entirely new, but merely a stitching of earlier, shorter, materials.<br /><br />Overall, this is a mildly provocative book that certainly does a good job of deconstructing many of the illogical dogmas surrounding the idea of free will, but won't entirely convince a skeptical reader who is already aware of the traditional arguments about free will or the lack thereof.<br /><br />2.5 stars.

B006CR2PD0|5.0|FINALLY a release that does Adrian Lyne's film justice.  The standard def dvd was one of the worst transfers I have ever seen for a movie.  Parts of the film looked as if someone had stepped on them with football cleats, especially the scene where Kim Bassinger dances to the song \\"You Can Leave Your Hat On\\".  Additionally the film was not given an anamorphic transfer, thus surrounding the film on all sides with an annoying black box when watched on an HD television.  Thankfully all of these issues have been delt with on this new release.  I have just finished watching the blu-ray disc and can happily report that this is an absolutely gorgeous transfer.  Blacks are coal deep and  colors are vibrant overall, allowing for Lyne's tendency for push processing and the resulting purposefully grainy texture which is noticeable in the transfer.  The sound has been improved immeasurably with the DTS-HD transfer.  If you have the old standard def dvd do yourself a favor and get this blu-ray edition and watch one of the most visually stunning films ever shot.  If you are purchasing the dvd for the first time definitely buy this over the non-anamorphic standard def dvd.

006197806X|5.0|I have a theory. You see, I just finished Pandemonium ten minutes ago and couldn't stop thinking about it. I NEEDED to get my thoughts down on paper. This doesn't happen very often with book reviews. My theory is this: the Delirium trilogy is similar to a puzzle. In the first book, Lena is docile, weak, and meek. In this book, Lena is the exact opposite- hard, cold, and most of all ... angry. You can see this in the covers to the books- in the first, the colors are blue. The model is wide eyed and innocent looking. On the cover for Pandemonium- the model is fierce, picking the reader apart with her angry glare. The colors are orange, red, and the plants give the model a wild look to her.<br /><br />Some may find this off-putting. Lena's personality seems to have made a complete 180 degree turn. But if you look at the big picture (and if my theory is correct), you can't look at one book without the other. This trilogy seems to be Lena's path to becoming a complete person. A person who has a balance of strong with weak, passion with common sense, and calmness with ferocity. A complete person. Delirium and Pandemonium are those complete opposites- and I really believe book three will be the book that ties them together.<br /><br />As for the book itself, Lauren Oliver did a fantastic job! At first, I was bothered with how different Lena seemed since the last book (understandably so, but still?). About halfway through the book, I realized- Lena still doesn't have it figured out yet. She will, but she is still struggling to find a balance between the \\"wild\\" and the \\"order\\" in herself.<br /><br />Yes, there is a second love interest, and yes he is important, but I don't really think that that is what Pandemonium is really about. Pandemonium is more about Lena's journey and how far into \\"wild\\" she is willing to go.<br /><br />I hope you will all read this book when it comes out- and when you do get a chance to read it, hop back here and let me know if you agree with me. I, personally, can't wait for the third book. I applaud the author for her complex story lines and most of all- for making me think about what makes up a \\"good\\" person.personally, can't wait for the third book.

0143119680|2.0|The idea of the characters in this book intrigued me enough to buy it.  Because it was hardcover, I read a few reviews and decided to try my local library first.  As it turns out, the price was right!  It was a bit plodding and I felt myself thinking,\\"OK, move it along.\\"  As I was nearing the end, I realized that there were too many loose ends to be tied up but not enough pages.  I began to worry if all of my reading was going to result in one of those reality show pauses where you have to wait until after the commercial.  The disappointment really started to set in when I realized that this book had to be part of a series.  I finished it because I had invested so much time and energy trying to like it and kept hoping that I was wrong.  It just had to get better!  It didn't.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the characters or the plot interesting enough to go any further than this first book.

B0053JJLLC|3.0|While not as good as The Andromeda Strain or Jurassic Park, Micro is a fantastic roller coaster.  The characters are typical Crichton fare (knowledgeable scientist becomes a hero, tough brunette chick must prove herself to men, etc), and many of the scenarios were predictable (SPOILER bad guy gets done-in by his own technology), but it was a thrilling final book from one of the finest sci-fi writers of this generation.  This book is an easy weekend reader, and almost comes off as being a screenplay, so it'll probably find its way to Hollywood before long.

B006UG90RM|4.0|As a huge Van Halen fan mostly the classic David Lee Roth days. I was thrilled when i heard that there was a new album coming with David Lee Roth back on vocals.I have seen a lot of reviews some negative some positive.I agree Dave is not the same singer he wss in the early 80's but his voice is still good to sing the songs.I have heard the album about 20 times since i got it and i have a few things to say. the first single i heard a few months ago Tattoo is very catchy but not one of the best songs on the album it sounds like early 1990's solo Roth and is not an example of the whole album but it was the first music i have heard from VH in over 10 years and Eddie is the best guitarist since Jimi Hendrix so it's a shame if he is not heard live or on record. his playing is still great Alex also is playing well and Wolfgang is Eddie's son so you know he has ablity.Michael Anthony's singing is missed most i agree with that but most of the songs still sound great.VH has gone back to the Fair Warning Women And Children First sound which were two of there heaviest and best albums. some songs i know were from the old days from demos since i am a collector of rare music. She's The Women and Blood On Fire those are two vintage sounding songs they sound that way for a reason there from 1977-80 but anyone who thinks this is just an album of old songs is wrong.they have used old songs in the past to put on the albums.they wrote some new tunes also in the old style.The Trouble With Never and HoneyBabySweetieDoll two of my favorites sound like songs from 1984 Girl Gone Bad House Of Pain etc.VH best songs were not always the singles on the radio.another song that sounds old is Stay Frosty a sequel to Ice Cream Man but this is a VH song not an old blues song I like the acoustic playing by Eddie but it is not one of the best songs. AS IS is also a good song very heavy sounds like something that could of been on the last few records from the 1990's .Beats Working is the other song i like a lot.the album is not there best for me it's the first album (1978) or (1984) a tie.but it is a very good album ,these days when there is a lot of untalented rock music with no melodies it's great to have great musicans with good songs it does not hurt that one of the best guitarists and frontmen ever are back.I reccomend this album to any VH fan or rock fan .the album gets a 4 rating from me!ke a lot.the album is not there best for me it's the first album (1978) or (1984) a tie.but it is a very good album ,these days when there is a lot of untalented rock music with no melodies it's great to have great musicans with good songs it does not hurt that one of the best guitarists and frontmen ever are back.I reccomend this album to any VH fan or rock fan .the album gets a 4 rating from me!

By the end though, I was involved and crying.<br /><br />Kennedy's assassination was a moment in time that I still remember vividly.<br /><br />I purchased the hard back version, and wish more of the reviews were based strictly on the book.

B004UXUX7S|4.0|I found 'The Descendants' to be quite interesting and touching with a nice performance by George Clooney.  It is somewhat of a family picture as well with no crazy car chases, gun fights or stuff like that.  My only complaint was at the end we were not exactly sure what he did with the land.  Appeared he kept it but then again I left the theatre with that question which I did not like since it really did not bring closure to the film.  Maybe I missed something but I never got bored during the movie so would be hard for me to think I did miss something.  Nonetheless, a very fine picture.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Used to be my favorite radio app. Now all it keeps saying is &quot;an error occurred&quot; Shame. Hope it gets fixed.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres when it first came out and I loved it.  Now my teenage daughter and her friends watch this movie over and over...haha.  I guess they like the main characters and the love story.  But overall it's just a good movie about how horrible things have happened in history and how real people were involved.  Everyone should have a copy of this good movie in their collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are lots of cool games! this game keeps you entertained for hours! help i cant stop playing!!!!!!!!!!!! you will love it too!
0307932427|1.0|This book is a very boring book. It just lists a lot of facts about human history. The first part deals with where we come from, the second part just deals with a lot of facts about food production, and the third part is somewhat interesting due to the discussion of plagues that hit Europe andAsia. The cd is of poor quality because it has been taken directlyfrom an old audio cassette version of this book. If you want to read a better historical account, I would reccomend another book.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Free version of Pinball Deluxe is \\"OK\\" game. But not outstanding! Most of the time the ball keeps going to the same place and there is very little randomness to it. The Scoreboard needs to be Brighter and more attractive rather that the dot-matrix style. People love to see big colorful scoreboard! The Advertising method seems slightly more intrusive and can affect your game-play when connected to Wi-Fi.<br /><br />Having said, The Advertising woes can be eradicated by turning off your Wi-Fi and It works OK on Kindle fire. Pinball Lovers will enjoy it anyways!
B003Y5HWMW|3.0|I was so excited to receive this in the mail yesterday but once my husband and I started to watch the second disc it started skipping about 25 minutes into episode 3. After trying to clean our blu-ray player and trying to play it in our PS3 we discovered there was a small crack in the disc. It seems to be a manufacturing defect not damaged in shipping and the packaging was very sturdy. After inspecting the rest of the discs we found that disc 4 and 5 also had the same defect. We will be returning to Amazon and hoping the next set we receive does not have this problem. If not for this problem we would rate this a 5 out of 5.
B0060Q962Q|2.0|What's up with the stretched ball on Kindle fire in Landscape mode?<br /><br />The app looks like watching 4:3 movie on 16:9 screen in 'stretched' mode. Am I missing something here?<br /><br />\\"HD\\" means new graphics bitmaps right? what's up with the stretched graphics? on Kindle Fire?<br /><br />Anyone else having the same issue? or is it only me.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|While I read this book a couple of years ago, it's still one that stays with me.  I absolutely loved the way the author intertwined the children's stories and the plot.  I couldn't put this book down- it was such a great one to get lost in!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is pure joy to play on Kindle Fire! - I love the character! and game play. The current version 1.3.1 plays perfectly on my Kindle fire.<br /><br />It is only 99c! Download your copy today! I am confident You too will fall in love with the character. Just like millions of people do.<br /><br />Kudos to the developer for making this adorable game! Definitely worth the money!<br /><br />Have fun!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|its a game that you cant stop playing. If you are bored and need something. to do this is the game
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I am loving this game. It has nice setting and makes you feel that you are playing [[ASIN:B0009V9P56 Tomb Raider: Legend]] but not having to jump, climb or get into boss fights. While I have not yet fully played this game first few puzzles were nice and challenging enough for me to conclude that this game will keep me and my family engaged for few weeks easily.<br /><br />I am planning on updating my review if I encounter issues during the full game play. But for $1.99 I think this game  is surely a good purchase as it has very good challenging scenes and graphics.<br /><br />MARCH 08 2012 (Game finished)<br />EDIT: OK Purchase! (I initially thought it would take weeks to solve this puzzle game. But to my surprise, I was able to solve it within few hours of game-play.<br /><br />The reason I am downgrading my review to 4 stars is due to the pain navigating thru' the maps. There is a map but it makes you tap number of times up and down to get to where one needs to go. If developer is reading this please update the program where one can tap on the map screen to get to the actual screen.<br /><br />For budget conscious gamer please bear in mind that at $1.99 it seems little too much. It should be 99c for a game that can be solved in 4 hrs (Without looking at the hints)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|RJ Palacio's \\"Wonder\\" should be required reading in the middle grades. The book is told by multiple narrators, so we get to know a lot of feelings and how some misunderstandings develop.<br /><br />The most important character is August Pullman, a child with severe facial deformities. He has been home-schooled, but now that he's ready for middle school (5th grade in this book), his parents encourage him to try a private school.<br /><br />Auggie is not too enthused, but he goes along for a \\"look-see\\" visit. The counselor and principal have set up some student guides that they can count on to make Auggie feel at home. The visit goes fairly well, and Auggie begins his journey.<br /><br />He quickly finds out the importance of where you sit at lunch (table = social status). When no one else will sit with him, Summer walks over. They become friends by talking to one another. Summer thinks Auggie is funny. She sees more in him than a face.<br /><br />Palacio gives us the full gamut of middle schoolers, from the \\"plague\\" if you touch the wrong person to the excitement over class projects. The lesson here is kindness. Why not choose kindness when you can?<br /><br />I like it that Palacio also gives Auggie's older sister, Via, a voice. She has been pushed into the background due to Auggie's various needs and operations. In high school, maybe no one will even care that her brother is Auggie?<br /><br />Children can learn to get along and to quit bullying. As more and more kids are mainstreamed, it is important for these issues to be talked about. From wheelchairs to feeding tubes to kids with autism--no one should be made afraid at school.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I've played other Mahjong games but this is the first one I've played with some kind of storyline.  I got it for free and enjoy it.  Not sure if I would have paid $4.99 though.  The graphics and the music are excellent though.  I do have to say that it's extremely addicting.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|totally addicted. it's not amazing but it is entertaining... and free!<br />it looks good on the kindle fire.  i reccomend.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I have read numerous times about the \\"terrible DVD container\\" or DVD holders. To confirm a majority of those reviews are correct. On the other hand I will not rate this product due to only the cheap holder. This is the complete series and it is awesome. I rarely use that word but I have to repeat it again truly an AWESOME series.<br /><br />The complete series gives you a chance to keep your imagination going, learn morals, great actors, and true entertainment for sci-fi and space fans. If you do the math of rounding to the hundred dollar $300/49 = $6.12 per DVD. Each DVD has atleast 3 - 5 episodes. In the overall view it pays for itself.<br /><br />For some people who expect the best DVD holder, then you will be deeply disappointed. But judging a TV series only by the holder is like judging a book by its cover. With all the frustration of the holder I don't mind owning one of the best TV series created. If you grew up watching Star Trek The Next Generation then this will bring nostalgia and happiness back to your life.<br /><br />If you have the money and keep questioning about buying it, I would say \\"purchase it\\" and as Cpt. Jean-Luc Picard and Cmd. Riker would say \\"Engage!\\" and savor the series.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|This game is well done and plays well on a Vizio vtab and my wife's Kindle. A great way to pass time.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Nice free Chess game. It is very challenging indeed. It plays 'okay' on Kindle fire. 4 stars!<br /><br />Wishlist:<br /><br />(*) Please give options to change the board color.<br />(*) Please make the board characters slightly big and use the full real estate of the tablet.<br /><br />Thanks for making this good app free!<br /><br />Cheers!
B006KC4NK0|5.0|THIS NEW BATCAVE IS AWSOME. BUT THE ORIGINAL WAS BETTER. THIS ONE IS TO SMALL. THE CHARACTERS DO LOOK BETTER THOUGH. OVERALL IT IS A GOOD LEGO AND COULD BE USED FOR STOP MOTION
B004SBX112|5.0|I love all the versions of the Angry Birds games and have been purchasing the ad free versions one by one as I make the move over from my iPod Touch to having them on my Kindle Fire and my Android phone.  I am, however, disappointed that the new update which includes the new Cherry Blossom level, is not available yet in the Amazon Market, only in Google Play and iTunes.  I hope it will be coming soon!
0061537934|5.0|All I can tell you is this book was recommended to me by a friend, and it was so good, I loved it!
B001TODCII|5.0|Though this is fiction, the Sex Slavery market is real.  All young ladies traveling abroad should see this movie to be made aware that these things DO happen.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|A great, quality game with the added bonus of nostalgia! But, like another reviewer mentioned, online multiplayer would make this game perfect.
B0055SWM08|1.0|I don't enjoy this app at all!!! IT IS SOOOO BORING!!!!!!! PLUS even though it's the most boring app EVER you still have to PAY for it!!!!!
0553103547|5.0|As the fantasy genre of today seems to be trending more and more towards dark, gritty and more based on historical realities, George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones sets the bar on how well this model can work. I have seen criticisms around the web that talk negatively about the brutal depictions of events in the novel, the negative treatment of women and children and the overall dark tones of the novel. To all of these criticisms I say, pick up a history book. Life in the middle-ages was not all sunshine and rainbows. We may like to romanticize medieval times, but the harsh facts are that life was not easy and for most people it basically sucked.<br /><br />I think that Mr. Martin has crafted a grand epic here that manages to represent a lot of the harsh realities of the historical time-frame that his world is related to while still managing to craft a story that is his own and still contains many of the fantastical elements that lead people to turn to fantasy over historical fiction. His characters are strong and, while the women are treated pretty unfairly, some of them manage to stand out as strong characters in their own right.<br /><br />A great start to a series that I look forward to continuing soon. I would highly recommend giving it a try unless you're easily upset by graphic violence and gore. If you're looking for fairies, unicorns and rainbows, you won't find them here. Unless the fairies are having their wings plucked, the unicorns are pulling siege equipment and the rainbows are being covered in clouds of despair!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|came before time good service end good value thank youwe think it is a grate move we are wayting to wach it
0446585025|2.0|A friend wrote me that she had to stop reading this book on her train ride into work because she was busting out loud laughing!  I said to myself, THAT is the kind of book I want to read!  So, I ordered it on my Kindle and started to read it, laughing out loud.  It wasn't much further into the book that the laughing started to die down and the book jumped all over the place for me, from being a Covergirl to how important it is to get a colonoscopy.  Not so funny, so I didn't even finish it.  Don't bother with this one.
B006QPVGKG|1.0|Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen.  It was horrible!  Thought it would be really an interesting \\"Apollo 13\\" type movie but I found it to be very, very boring.  Would not recommend this to anyone.  SAVE YOUR BRAIN FOR SOMETHING ELSE, LIKE HOP-SCOTCH OR SOMETHING............
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|THIS IS MY REVIEW FOR THE BOSS MAN. THIS CD IS THE BEST IN YEARS. THIS IS A PERSONAL RECORD.EACH SONG IS DIFFERENT SAD AND ALSO UP BEAT. I SEEN THE CRITICS MAKE THEIR COMMENTS. I MAKE MY OWN JUDGEMENTS. I LISTENED to IT 4 TIMES AND IT GROWS ON YOU. LISTEN TO JACK OF ALL TRADES HAS A SAD AND EMOTIONAL SOUND WITH THE MUSIC. THIS CD IS 5 STARS AND IF YOU ARE A SERIOUS MUSIC FAN YOU SHOULD BUY THIS.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I like the game but am still waiting for gems that I purchased !!!! The game also drains my battery on my EVO.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|A blast from the past. Love that it was the free app of the day!! Aside from swearing at the computer player for making me feel stupid....beware....lol.....the computer is quite a player.....haha......But that's what makes it so addictive as you are compelled to kick the computer player's ass!!...haha ...it's a fun great game!!!!
B0052GACNM|2.0|Tony Bennett remains the best male singer ever and a consummate entertainer as well. I listened to the CD once and am almost ashamed to use it as a coaster. While everyone involved surely enjoyed the project and all are terrific solo artist, with few exceptions this is a tough one to get through. When it ended I listened to the Tony Bennett/Bill Evans recordings, something every Tony Bennett fan should have in their collection. Duets 1 is a better option.
1612130283|2.0|I had no idea this book is a trilogy, not in the respect that it's 3 different stories involving the main character, but it's a \\"to be continued\\" for the purpose it seems to have you buying 3 books.  The first book (this one) was okay, but it did not leave me wanting to spend more money to see how the story ends.  It's not long enough that it had to be chopped into 3 books, so my conclusion is it's simply a marketing ploy to get you to spend more for one story.
0062082353|2.0|Very disapointed with the book.  Did not like the writing style.  I have read better book reports from grade 5 students.
B003A6X0P8|5.0|Thanks to the DP appreciation society for great recording of the best this lineup had to offer. Glenn Hughes at his finest and the whole band is rockin. Only regret is the ommission of You Keep On Moving and the fact that this lineup dissolved without reaching full potential.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Very cool This game is great.would have been happy if i had paid for it. very realistic.  sounds good also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Generally, I hate to read, but I couldn't put this book down.  I only started reading it because so many people said they liked it, and I wanted to do something besides playing tetris battle on facebook with my spare time.  So, I started this book and finished the trilogy within 3 weeks.  It was amazing.
B004UID2LC|4.0|When it doesn't download it is due to You Tube changes.  The most Xclent authors of this app will then send OT an update to fix it.  I used it for many months now.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|It's already been said, but I'll say it again: this is Bruce's best in at least twenty years.  It combines a little bit of everything he's done over the past two decades...  Plus more.<br /><br />\\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" is great, but is not indicative of this disc as a whole.  There is variety here, and heart; the Boss sounds as inspired as he did on The Rising.<br /><br />I cannot imagine what the writers of these bad-mediocre reviews are hearing.  I say: Pick this up.
1612130283|5.0|This book is not for the timid little catholic school girl. This is for someone who enjoys reading about sex and doesn't blush! Excellent read, hard to put down. Finished this in less than 2 days. Almost 1/2 way done with the second book! Stunning read! I'd give it ten stars if I could.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so fun. will play 4 hours. you can buy games 4 free.my favorite one is Romeo's plan.u have to launch Romeo to his wife
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I got the blu-ray today and I'm very impressed. I have watched the whole first episode and bits and pieces of other episodes and extra features. I'm looking very forward to watching it in total very soon. Hopefully I can get the wife who is not into fantasy to watch with me! I will not discuss the episodes or the show itself ... there is enough of that from the 100+ reviews that did not actually review the blu-rays. The production values of this show were nothing short of amazing and they have created a quality blu-ray set. At only $35 I'm blown away at the value.<br /><br />The video quality of these blu-rays is over the top. HBO is known for having quality blu-rays but this set sets a new mark. Colors are perfect, primaries are bold and primeval, black levels are dark and menacing, skin tones are amazing (whitish in the frosty north, gorgeous in the summery south), and contrast and clarity are flawless. To get this kind of quality on a TV series is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />The DTS-HD Master Audio of this set is nearly as awesome as the video. The audio is very immersive. Dialog is perfect and dynamics catch every detail. The low-end is great, the LFE channel gets a work out. Surround is also very well done.<br /><br />This is a great blu-ray set! Very recommended!

B001BANK32|4.0|I have seen the movie, and read other Stephen King books, but for some reason I took my time getting to this one. From everything you've seen about Stephen King's personal life, you'll recognize autobiographical details in this book immediately. Having struggled with addiction myself, King excellently uses issues related to addiction and recovery in this horror medium.
B000069HKH|5.0|When this album came out I was very shocked that Bruce Springteen was reuniting with the E-Street Band for the first time in over a decade and a half for a new album. Should've seen the signs with Max Weinberg being absent so many weeks from his place as the house band leader for Conan O'Brian while \\"touring with Bruce\\". Than of course it happened. And \\"it\\" was the trade center attack of 2011 (I don't use 9/11 as it's become an arrogant buzz word). It actually wasn't long before Bruce was back in the studio with the newly revived E-Street Band making a new album that did in fact seek to explore that issue. It would seem as if Springsteen might just be one of those people who finds himself working better with direct inspiration than anything else. As with most Bruce Springsteen recordings,he doesn't approach things in any lightweight sort of manner. It would've been all to easy for him to approach the topic of the post 2001 world with the emphasis on a couple of characters effected by it. But of course he didn't. Something more complex happened. As he realized around this time,the immediate \\"pop 9/11\\" world and it's \\"war on terror\\" was filled with so much racial/religious hatred and blind patriotism on both sides of everything that a well rounded treatment would be very much needed.<br /><br />  This is a slight bit different than a lot of the Bruce Springsteen albums that had come before. Usually his records has a very singular musical and conceptual focus. This does not. Musically it's very much all over the map. But so are it's themes. On \\"Lonesome Day\\",\\"Into The Fire\\",\\"The Fuse\\",\\"Nothing Man\\" and \\"You're Missing\\" the music is somewhat brooding and melancholy making one think this is going to be somewhere in the vein of [[ASIN:B0000025D0 Darkness on the Edge of Town]] and [[ASIN:B0000025T6 Nebraska]]. But he's only setting the stage for the concept of the paranoia,distrust and uncertainty surrounding the events of September 2001,even the concept of a religiously forbidden love affair on the Arabic flavored dance/trance type piece \\"Worlds Apart\\". On the other hand \\"Waitin' On A Sunny Day\\",\\"Countin' On A Miracle\\",\\"Let's Be Friends (Skin To Skin)\\" and the gospel drenched title song all mark a return to that big rock n soul type sound the E Street Band were so noted for in their prime with stories of hope and human outreach. There's another rocker here \\"Further On (Up The Road)\\" dealing with a desperate person about to do a desperate act. On songs such as the mildly hip-hop/rock hybrid of \\"The Fuse\\" and the more anthemic quality of the closing \\"My City Of Ruins\\" the theme has to do mainly with America and our expressions of patriotism.<br /><br />  By taking all the emotionalism and political rhetoric so often associated with this particular era Bruce Springsteen,together with the E-Street Band managed to create an album that used his excellent way with poetic character sketches to illustrate the human side of what was happening to the world. There were no direct commentaries on the singing fire fighters at the beginning of every TV show this side of SNL. Or of the media's self censorship of the era-delaying and often outright banning films and literature that might encourage any violence or (to a broader extenet) how American was handling the issues we were suddenly forced to contend. Those were important issues for sure. But at the same time by addressing the whole thing with his own unique style of commentary,as well as placing it in the context of a far broader musical base than he normally applied to a single album Springsteen not only re-awakened his recording career with a bang but had a whole new source of inspiration as well. He wouldn't have to find new ways to maintain his \\"working class hero\\" persona anymore. That persona had now matured into that of a seasoned and observant poet who was willing to bring all the musical styles he'd embraced over the years together,in one album,to tell this story. And that story was an all around success for everyone involved it seemed.n all around success for everyone involved it seemed.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I was disappointed to find out that the Kindle Fire would not work with my Picasa videos. Then I read about PicFolio for Picasa HD. Initially, I was taken aback because there were no explicit instructions. I immediately emailed Customer Support and I was pleasantly surprised to receive a response a short time later. I was even more surprised when Brian provided the step-by-step solution to my dilema; instead of a canned response one often receives in this type of situation. I can now show off my videos to family and friends from my Kindle!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read all three books within a week.  While in some parts, I was left wondering \\"W?hat exactly just happened?\\", I was intrigued.  Great set of books.  Kept me hanging for each new book.  I can see why young adults would like it, but have no desire to see it as a movie.  Hated to see it end.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|I cannot stress enough how brilliantly this film was made. Not only did I see if twice in the theater, but have viewed it several times since aquiring in on dvd. There is a magic intermingling between the actors, the cinamatography, and definately the music score that leaves a deep sense of dread in the human psyche. An almost baited mixed breath of bone deep fear, shocking conclusions, and sudden need to take stock in case of the worse case scenarios as the movie unfolds, and we become aware of individuals and the huge populations of the areas where they are located.We know that what we seeing is not only possible, but by all accounts from the WHO, CDC & Prevention and most Intelligent Sectors and Concerened Goverments, this is a time bomb simply waiting to happen. As one character responds to a question concerning whether someone could weaponize the Avian Flu his answer is succinct and terrible at the same time: \\"no one has to, the birds are doing it all by themselves.\\" We see signs of profittering, lies and misdirections by both private person,sectors and some health care monitors, and finally given some hard, cold facts concerning the science, the testing, the production and storage of a treatment protocol. A treatment protocal that will no doubt shock Educated American audiences who assume from their yearly flu shots, and the seemingly empty scares of the last swine flu outbreaks that western goverments and Health Organizations, including our own, can supply the demands for treatments in a quick and timely manner. As the movie progresses the truths of a global pandemic of any unique viral strain becomes all to depressingly shocking and terrifying. While there are moments of levity abd resolution, the overall truth of this film must be addressed and understood. If for no other reason than to prepare oneself for the eventuality. If you are seeing this the first time at home, do yourself a huge favor and watch it again to catch so many things that may be lost by overwhelming data and images. An absolutely billiant, thought provoking, and superbly tailored film from openinng credits to the kicker at the end. Bravo!
B005HP2JAM|2.0|First, if you're looking for a good film to show off 3D, this is not for you.  I can hardly tell this is even in 3D except for the outdoor shots.  With 3D you need images close and far away to really get the perspective and overall effect.  Not every movie can benefit from 3D and this isn't one of them.  It also appears to be shot with cheaper cameras.  This isn't IMAX.<br /><br />Also this movie would have been better had they used an American production for filming and editing, narration or British.  It's very hard to understand the thick English speaking French narration throughout the film.  There are some voiceovers but honestly they should have just subtitled or voiced over they entire film.<br /><br />The film comes in at nearly 90 minutes and it goes on like it will never end.  They could have trimmed at least 20 minutes off and you wouldn't have missed anything.  A lot of interior shots of the cave are reused several times, where you could just re watch it and see it again.<br /><br />Overall, if you like archeology, anthropology or history, you'll probably enjoy it, just don't expect the grand performance of David Attenborough or visuals of Planet Earth and I can't give it any more than 2 stars for its faults.
B005HSL626|3.0|this game is a lot of fun but it freezes on my a lot so my scores are constantly being erased. I use the kindle fire.
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|Obviously it effected Bruce heavily when \\"Big Man\\" Clerence Clemons passed away last year. But Bruce is as devoted as ever stating \\"Clerence doesn't leave when he dies. Clerence leaves when WE die!\\". This is the last album to be released with his musical imput. Not only that but it features an \\"expanded\\" group. The E-Street Band are one some tracks but on others an array of guests come in and out to such a degree it's hard to tell whose playing on what. In this case that makes sense because Bruce was obviously going out of his way to make an epic album here. One where the production and the instruments themselves made themselves heard clearly and crisply. And as usual he has something to say. His career was defined by a somewhat serialized character sketch across many of his classic albums that showcase the importance of American's everyday working class with the countries better qualities. He gave us the good,the bad and the ugly of this. And always with a lot of good poetry and even irony mixed in now and again. Sometimes however,such as was the case on records like [[ASIN:B0000025D0 Darkness on the Edge of Town]] he allowed his outrage and true heart to run free and let the audience know the realities of his characters that bore further scrutiny. Now thirty-four years after that album he is looking to similar emotions for his new album as well.<br /><br />  Musically this is very much of a hybrid. It has some of his classic E-Street era sound mixed with some of the folk fusion type sounds of his most recent albums. The opener \\"We Take Care Of Our Own\\" is definitely classic E-Street and even something of a \\"Born In The USA\\" for our times,only with little chance of mistakening it's intent. Bruce clearly shows his disgust and irritation over our pretenses: still clinging to the idea of being a giving and helpful nation while doing so often to benefit (or at the detriment of) our own. And that's a theme that runs throughout this album. On clangy country/folk fusion such as \\"Shackled And Drawn\\" and \\"Death To My Hometown\\" along with more classic E-Street type soul rockers in \\"You've Got It\\",\\"Rocky Ground\\" and \\"Land Of Hopes And Dreams\\" he extends the theme outward towards once voiceless people who...are now thought not to have a voice and can only snicker in silent contempt at what their world is doing to them. On \\"This Depression\\",the title song and the heavily gospel based closer \\"We Are Alive\\" there's this sense of first acknowledging than overcoming the end of industrial revolutions and the beginning of industrial decay. On the more muscly rock tunes \\"Easy Money\\" and \\"You've Got It\\" there's even a bit of the sense that technique of the wildcat rebellion of the [[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]] era might be a good enough resource in dealing with some of these situations.<br /><br />  What all this really boils down to is that this album thoroughly examines the uncertain and often frustrated state of mind Americans,especially his beloved working class Americans,are still dealing with as the era of 9/11 with all the self censorship and culture of denial is coming to an end. Bruce is now entering a world of internet revolutions and Occupy. An era when a call to arms is no longer seen cynically as a marketing tactic and is again begin to have a realistic meaning to people. In all honesty too Bruce is also aware he's entering (or already in the midst of) the autumn of his career. And he can see that settling down into making \\"comfortable\\" music that just rests on his past laurels won't cut it for him. No he's not Bob Dylan. Or Johnny Cash. Or Pete Seeger. But he is part of a legacy they've all left. He's a musical troubadour who carries with him a message from the people who normally exist as this countries living backround noise. And by accompanying this powerful statement of intent with music that's as rich and powerful..well as three of his classic albums put together? Well if for some reason this was the album Bruce Springsteen chose to retire on (and I hope it isn't),I don't think many would be very disappointed.hose to retire on (and I hope it isn't),I don't think many would be very disappointed.

1451683405|3.0|In his new essay, neuroscientist Sam Harris has declared free will to be illusory. He bases this monumental conclusion on the undeniable fact that in laboratory experiments neural activity occurs in human subjects' brains prior to conscious decisions. He just fails to consider the ambiguous implications of these experiments.<br /><br />He says: \\"You might spend an hour thinking and acting freely in the lab, only to discover that the scientists scanning your brain have been able to produce a complete record of what you would think and do some moments in advance of each event.\\"<br /><br />Thus encapsulated is the book's argument--as well as the fallacy of that argument. Yes, neural activity takes place prior to decision-making, but to state that what a subject might be thinking is in any way available to someone privy to EEG or fMRI findings is just absurd. Excitation of neurons is not the same thing as a thought--and neither is transparent from the readout of medical instruments. Unfortunately, such overstatement as this occurs throughout the essay.<br /><br />Surely Harris misspoke in the quotation here. But the overreaching it suggests is part and parcel of his approach. He is convinced, based on scant evidence, that prior events in the brain make our decisions for us. We may believe we decide but absolutely we don't. Indeed, the pioneering research of the late neurophysiologist Benjamin Libet and neuroscientist John-Dylan Haynes is provocative but it does not definitively obliterate free will.<br /><br />Philosopher Eddy Nahmias , writing in the Opinionator blog of The New York Times, has a more thoughtful and scientifically respectable approach to the research on free will. He says, \\"(T)he existing evidence does not support the conclusion that free will is an illusion. First of all, it does not show that a decision has been made before people are aware of having made it. It simply finds discernible patterns of neural activity that precede decisions. If we assumethat conscious decisions have neural correlates, then we should expect to find early signs of those correlates `ramping up' to the moment of consciousness. It would be miraculous if the brain did nothing at all until the moment people became aware of a decision....\\"<br /><br />Harris, though, in his over-eager way, wants certainty NOW. He's categorical:  Our choices appear in our minds as though \\"sprung from the void,\\" he states. Although neuroscience is in its infancy, he speaks as if this is the last word on the subject. Yet at this early stage we don't even know what consciousness is. And while the neural correlates are necessary, no one has yet proven that they are sufficient to cause conscious states. Someone with faith in another system might argue that we participate in consciousness rather than generating it on the spot. It is still the wild West out there in realm of neuroscience.<br /><br />Here's where Harris gets a gold star, however. He doesn't dodge the implications of his position. And this means that if people, even criminals, aren't ultimately responsible for what they do, our justice systems must take this into consideration. Not that dangerous people should be allowed to remain in society, but we should do all we can to rehabilitate them. Furthermore, we should eliminate all vestiges of vengeance from punishment meted out. Now that is taking a significant stand.<br /><br />Where Harris gets a failing grade is in philosophy. Yes, he considers determinism, libertarianism, and compatabilism. That's not the point. He neglects to acknowledge that  at present we have extremely limited data and extremely limited knowledge about what actually constitutes consciousness. Neuroscience is still in the cradle. It's way too soon to assume an end point has been reached and the ancient problem of free will resolved.<br /><br />Science is not static. Does Harris really believe that his position will hold steady after more and more competing labs have reported in?Does he really believe that further research will not subsume the research he is citing? Of course, no one knows what the future will bring. But if the history of science is any model, we are in the beginning stages of an ongoing dialectic.

B0052U59F4|5.0|I was with the author pretty much from day one as she wrote and posted each chapter on a major fan fiction website.  The characters were based on the characters from a major film, so the reader automatically could picture the actors as the story progressed.  Each time she posted a chapter, it was like getting a hit of some drug that I just couldn't live without.  Maybe those posting negative reviews need to divide it up a chapter a day or a week or even a couple of weeks like I did.  Each little bit she gave us only made me crave more.  The author is lovely and each time I offered her feedback she was always prompt and genuine in her replies.  This is a kinky story, but it tells you that up front.  I often told her I would pay to read this, and I highly suggest this book to anyone who wants to read a sexually erotic book from the point of view of a strong-willed, yet innocent girl who discovers herself through her love of the most complex of men.  My favorite part is their first night together.  Read it and you will understand.  Like Christian, you will admire this young girl who becomes a the sophisticated woman who conquers his heart.  Love you Icy!

B006CDCWDM|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because I'm a big Nadal fan but I thought it was boring, pretentious and inauthentic.  Rafa's obsession with Federer is a little unsettling and his minute by minute replay of the Wimbledon final is tedious.<br /><br />The parts written by John Carlin are laughable.  Nadal is a man, not a god but you wouldn't get that impression from his writing.  His tongue baths are really off-putting.
B00005T30L|4.0|This is a good movie starring the beautiful Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen along with an endearing performance by Steve Buscemi. I found the characters to be somewhat dislikable in the opening scenes, but this is meant mostly for character development. You don't even know why the movie is entitled Ghost World until maybe half way through, which is also when the film becomes more cohesive. I enjoyed the movie and give it 4.5 stars overall.

B006KSAPV0|4.0|Spanish director Pedro Almodovar isn't known for delving into the realm of horror or psychological suspense, but his 2011 film, The Skin I Live In, his first film with longtime collaborator Antonio Banderas since 1990's Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, proved he could craft an effectively bizarre and uncomfortable mystery. Based on the French crime novel Mygale by Thierry Jonquet, The Skin I Live In focuses on a cosmetic surgeon who, having lost his burn victim wife and traumatized daughter to suicide, strives to develop a fire-retardant skin. With the help of his childhood caretaker, Marilia, he conducts experiments on a captive patient, until a visitor from his past shows up and unravels deep family secrets. The film lacks Almodovar's typical romantic flourish, but makes up for it with a stylish and engaging foray into arthouse psychodrama.

B004LWZW8I|1.0|One thing is for sure: former music video and commercial director Tarsem Singh has an uncanny knack for visual flair. Unfortunately, if he were equally as adept at telling a story, his feature films would be at least twice as impressive. As it stands, last year's Immortals, his third film, is his worst effort thus far. The story, loosely based on Greek myth, follows the efforts of mortal king Hyperion, who embarks on a destructive campaign in hopes of locating a powerful bow once wielded by the Gods, and the outcast warrior Theseus who sets out to stop him with the help of an oracle. Recalling the hyperstylized graphic novel aesthetic of 300, Immortals contains a wealth of evocative imagery and technically impressive cinematography, but I found the story largely inert, with slack pacing and thin plotting that served primarily to fill the gaps between battles. In other words, it's a jumble of a tale told with spectacular visuals, and in still other words, it's par for the course for Tarsem Singh.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Loved Game of Thrones and therefore had to read A Clash of Kings, and really did enjoy it, but found the endless descriptions of battles and battle dress a bit tedious and his books are a little on the long side, but I will read the next one.

B002ZG97LK|3.0|Yeah, I know; I was thinking it too: \\"A Footloose remake? Why?\\" If there was any saving grace to the idea, it was that the film was to be helmed by the man who brought us Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan, two movies steeped in the music and culture of the American South. As it turns out, much to the surprise of moviegoers who initially balked at the remake, Craig Brewer's updated Footloose isn't half bad. Following cues from the original film relatively closely -- with a few tweaks -- the story revolves around a big city high schooler who moves to a small, conservative Southern town where, due to a past teenage tragedy, loud music and public dancing have been outlawed. Throw in a star-crossed romance with the local reverend's rebellious daughter, and you're looking at a pretty faithful remake. I felt that Brewer did a respectable job both paying homage to the original film and updating the story for a new generation, infusing Footloose with the same kind of energy he harnessed for his previous films. This probably won't blow your socks off, but it may surprise you.

1451683405|1.0|Apparently Sam Harris can't help writing half-baked arguments off the top of his head, starting with his annoying \\"The End of Faith\\" in which he goes after Western religions only to turn around and give Eastern spirituality and related pseudoscience a free pass:    \\"There also seems to be a body of data attesting to the reality of psychic phenomena, much of which has been ignored by mainstream science....There may even be some credible evidence for reincarnation.\\"    I am unconvinced that neuroscience has developed to the point that allows for the type of conclusions Harris draws.  There's even a name for this over-reaching.  It's called \\"Brain Overclaim Syndrome.\\"  ([...]) Such conclusions about free will can have tremendous social impacts and should be considered extremely carefully and thoroughly.    Harris's mystical side makes him suspect as a fellow who can analyze brain science objectively. In her essay \\"Spirited Away,\\" a review of \\"The End of Faith\\" in the New Humanist/UK, Meera Nanda writes cogently about Harris's credibility, which directly relates to his newest book:    \\"He celebrates the growing popularity of western and eastern occult traditions, everything from 'shamanism, Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Hermetism and its magical Renaissance spawn (Hermeticism) and all the other Byzantine paths whereby man has sought the Other in every guise of its conception.' He rejects a naturalistic understanding of nature and the human mind and sets consciousness free from such mortal things as brains and bodies, allowing the possibility of pan-psychism, the doctrine of immanence of awareness or consciousness throughout the universe. For someone studying to be a neuroscientist, Harris holds rather unconventional views. He scoffs at the physicalism of the mainstream of scientists who believe that our mental and spiritual lives are wholly dependent upon the workings of the brain. He gives full credence to reports of near death experience and leaves open the possibility that adisembodied soul can survive the death of the body, claiming that we don't know what happens after death. After denying that consciousness is a product of our physiology, he presents it as a fundamental ingredient of nature, 'a far more rudimentary phenomenon than living creatures and their brains.' This is nothing but good old spiritual monism, the first principle of all New Age beliefs. The problem is not that Harris holds these beliefs, but that he wants to convince us that they are the very height of rationality.\\"
0385342063|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is back with her trademark fun and silly style in I've Got Your Number.  For a while I felt Kinsella was a bit off her game, but I enjoyed this book very much.  Yes, it's fun, fluffy and completely like a bag of potato chips - once you start, you don't want to stop reading.  This time her heroine is Poppy, engaged to stuffy, egotistical academic Magnus; at a party celebrating her engagement, Poppy somehow loses her family heirloom engagement ring.  In typical Kinsella-world craziness, Poppy finds an abandoned cell phone and connects with Sam Roxton, the employer of the phone's owner, and through emails and text messages, a relationship is established.  What happens after that is unpredictable and fairly nutty and will keep you reading even if you have more pressing things to do.<br /><br />Kinsella's easy style feels effortless, and watching Poppy try to figure out if Magnus is the right man for her and rooting for her to find a way through the mess she creates with the cell phone is so entertaining you don't want the book to end.  And although I usually feel irritated with movies and books that employ cell phones almost as another character, it didn't bother me here. Highly recommended for Kinsella fans as well as for those who haven't tried her yet - you're in for a treat!
B006UG90RM|4.0|This is a good, not great, addition to the Roth Van Halen cannon. It is great to hear them really rocking again, and some of the tunes really stand out.

0307888908|5.0|The basic premise in Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha's book is that the same mind-sets and skill-sets that can help to ensure the success of a start-up company's performance can also (with appropriate modification) help to ensure the success of an individual's career. In fact, all companies should always be viewed - and managed - as a start-up. This what Jack Welch had in mind years ago when, during a GE annual meeting, he explained why he admired entrepreneurial companies:<br /><br />\\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"<br /><br />Hoffman and Casnocha assert, \\"To succeed professionally in today's world, you need to adopt entrepreneurial strategies...In the same way, you need to stay young and agile; you need to forever be a [begin italics] start-up [end italics].\\" Speaking for both of them (as he does throughout the book), Hoffman adds, \\"The business strategies employed by highly successful [begin italics] start-ups [end italics] and the career strategies employed by highly successful [begin italics] individuals [end italics] are strikingly similar.\\" Readers are introduced to several \\"strategic frameworks\\" within which valuable (usually counterintuitive) insights are revealed by exemplary entrepreneurs such as Hoffman and Casnocha  (of course) as well as Marc Andreesen, Jeff Bezos, Benjamin Franklin, Reed Hastings, Steve Jobs, Mary Sue Milliken, Marc Pinkus, Joseph Priestley, and Sheryl Sandberg, with insights anchored in their real-world experience.<br /><br />Although Hoffman and Casnocha carefully identify the \\"what\\" of what organizational and individual success requires, they focus most of their attention on how (and how not to) achieve it. For example:<br /><br />o How to develop a YOUR COMPANY/YOU Mind-Set<br />o How to develop a YOUR COMPANY/YOU Skill-Set<br />o How to develop and then sustain a competitive advantage<br />o How to anticipate and prepare for contingencies with agility and resiliency<br />o How to bounce back from adversity<br />o How to establish and then strengthen a network of genuine and appropriate relationships<br />o How to identify and then pursue breakout opportunities<br />o How to identify and evaluate \\"intelligent\\" risks<br />o How to navigate professional challenges with network intelligence<br />o How to synthesize information into actionable intelligence<br /><br />Each of the Fortune 500 companies was originally a start-up and each of their CEOs was once a career-entry employee.  My guess (only a guess) is that the most successful companies and their leaders understand, appreciate, and affirm the power and value of the start-up mind-sets and skill-sets that Hoffman and Casnocha examine in this book.

It's the classic game \\"[[ASIN:B001FPK1OY Connect 4]]\\" where you try and get 4 of your checkers in a row while also preventing the opponent from doing the same.

It has a few different \\"themes\\" you can choose for the look of the game, but I just stuck with the classic look.<br /><br />Multiplayer is also a huge plus for this game.

I felt the sword play wasn't appropriate for younger children, the story line was silly and contrived, and overall a waste.<br /><br />Some of the so called Fairy Tales, like Jack and the Bean Stalk, do contain violence, or are at least a bit scary. But to make a silly movie, and try to pull all sorts of stories together was a waste of talent.<br /><br />I'm sure some will like it - my advice is to stream it first, before buying to watch multiple times. I for one will probably never watch it again. Sorry I didn't take my own advice, and 'preview' it first.

0439023513|5.0|The last of the trilogy...believe there should be a fourth book...it is not over as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Unbearable in its intensity, it is as worthy of five stars as the first book.<br /><br />Somewhat different in its approach, but yet familiar in its excitement, I found myself awestruck, actually relating today's political and terror inducing posibilities.<br /><br />The characters became more defined and moved me.  I was left saddened, fearful, hopeful...a poignant and conscience raising conclusion.<br /><br />No review can begin to relate a synopsis...don't hesitate...read them all.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins, you border on genuis!  Thank you!
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I was weary of a remake movie but I really enjoyed this!!  Definately recommend watching this ~ you maybe be suprised too!
B0071PS7AC|1.0|this app is not worth it, when the screen switches to focus on the pins the ball is not moving the same way as before the switch over
0307932427|2.0|We listened to the audio CD version of this book and it was a disappointment.  The reader's voice was grating and often distracted from the story.  But the story was overlong as well, and there were many times a point could have been made more succinctly.  The author is a well known scientist, but this attempt to communicate with a broader audience generally failed becuase of its presentation and the flabbiness of the writing rather than because of its content.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app and very useful. You can use it offline after you download what versions you'd like to read. The reading plans are awesome as well....love it!!

1400069289|5.0|Thanks to Charles Duhigg, I'm now thinking about habits all the time, and in a whole new way. His story of overcoming his afternoon cookie habit and the \\"cue, routine, reward\\" loop have got me thinking -- pretty much daily -- about ways I can rid myself of bad habits and adopt some good ones. Duhigg has a beautiful way of weaving stories and social science, much like Malcolm Gladwell or Dan Pink, to make an argument at once entertaining and illuminating.
0439813786|5.0|I love this book.  It's an experience and I love that it will open up a new audience to film history.  I'm excited to pass it on to my kids and grandkids.

0393330435|5.0|I have always been amazed at the history of the computer age.  I think this is partially due to being alive when all of this was happening and not even knowing that it was giving all of us a glimpse into the 21st century.  Steve's story is one that really captured my attention and made me feel like i was right beside him the whole time he was making history.  Give it a read!  You won't be sorry.
B006L1GNHQ|5.0|We had recorded the program knowing we would have to miss it do to company coming.  Someone stopped the recording to watch something else so we missed the program. We had a difficult time trying to follow the next program so we stopped that one and purchased the one we missed on my knidle fire. My husband and I set it up on the stand and watched it together!  The picture quality and audio were great.  No issues on ever doing this again.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I was in the app store to look at some more apps for my kindle fire and I had just bought this game for a dollar now it is 50 cents but anyway the game is excellent and addictive just ticked me off that the price went down
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I play on the Kindle Fire. I haven't experienced any of the control problems that others are having. Every game I've bowled, I've won. It took some getting used to, but I think it is a fun game to pass the time in between appts, etc. It is simple enough that an older kid could play. The reason I only give 4 stars is because I don't quite get the whole money thing after you win. It's not like you can bet with it. It is just there, with your recent scores. Seems like the game should have another aspect or something.<br /><br />I think the graphics were good, and you can change the color & weight of your ball, which is neat. I would NOT recommend this for cell phones, or anything with a small screen.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|This app might be fun if it ever worked correctly. 9 out of 10 times when I start the game its stuck on a solid green screen with no way to interact with, or even see any aspect of the game. This app is way too buggy to be anything but a waste of time.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee dissect the root causes of the jobless recovery and the connect them to the developments in technology.<br /><br />However, their proposals to address the issues identified was not as polished, and their optimistic final chapter seems at odds with the rest of the book. I am looking forward to their next book, because these guys know their subject
0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is probably one of the most impacting books I have ever read. The first part of his story, about his times in the concentration camps, manages to wrench the heart while still steering away from actively striving to highlight the suffering Frankl witnessed daily. Rather, his matter-of-fact tone and reserved yet descriptive telling of his stories in the concentration camps only serve to heighten the sense the reader gets of the trials he endured. But the most poignant part of the novel wasn't, for me, his stories but rather his overall message: that our greatest trait, and our greatest means of freedom, is the freedom to control our attitude towards any situation, no matter how horrendous (and here is where his experience in the concentration camps really serve to emphasize his point as well as his suffering and the suffering of others).<br /> The second part of the book, logotherapy, appealed to me almost more than the first portion did. Logotherapy focuses primarily on the goal of finding meaning in one's life. Upon reading the definition I thought, skeptic that I am, that sure--this is a great goal, but perchance all hot air. It wasn't until I read the rest of Frankl's portion on logotherapy, read as he related it to problems across all fields, from dissatisfaction at work to a loss of faith in one's own capabilities, and it wasn't until I went back and related these techniques that I realized how revolutionary Frankl's theories are.<br /> Of course logotherapy doesn't work for everyone and of course everyone will not agree with it, but believer in logotherapy or psychology or not, it would be a grievous error not to peruse Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. It is a book that will change the way you look at the world, whether you take the psychology into consideration or not.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|The app is fine. All you need is patience, but on my first game I beat the computer. Why is everyone complaining<br />about the game? For me it was simple to strike every turn some how.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A neat game to relax, de-stress, and pass the time with.  At first I was skeptical about playing, but I was very pleased. Easy to understand how to play, if you know nothing about it.

B002KKCVS2|4.0|I purchased these sandals for use on my boat, mostly when stepping off onto rocky shores. I've used them to work in the yard and it is nice to be able to run them under a faucet to clean them.<br /><br />They are comfortable and well designed.<br /><br />My only complaint is when I remove the upper strap the Velcro catches on the clasp and I have to work it through. There is a point where the strap changes from a loop to a hook and that is the place that doesn't easily go through the clasp. Also there is just enough material to make a good connection with the Velcro on the strap. I'm sure I picked the right size as it fits well otherwise.<br /><br />All in all it does fit and work and it will be appreciated when summer hits and we take the boat out.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I didn't know what to think about this art house film noir when it came out. Nonetheless, I'm glad I gave it a chance. Drive is easily one of the best films of 2011. Gosling gives a quiet, forceful performance as the driver with no name. The shocker wasn't his performance, nor was it Mulligan's; she was dynamite in Shame...<br />It was Albert Brooks. In this movie, he wasn't funny or witty. His clear and direct brutal violence at a moments whim was breathtaking. The parallel, for me, was how the driver and his friend, Shannon, were akin to Brooks' character and Perlman's character, Nino. They seemed to balance each other out nicely.<br /><br />This film is a throwback to Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. Gosling's body language and intense gaze took the place of much dialogue. I highly recommend this art house film.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app was extremely easy to set up on all computers. Its unbelievably impressive in comparison to the technologies we've seen so far.

B0071PS7AC|4.0|In order to play and win, you have to work within the physics of the game. It is NOT real bowling, but only similar to it. You can spin your ball so it 'hooks' into the pins, but if you start in the wrong place, your ball will gutter.<br /><br />I have beaten my opponent in all my games, with scores from 160 to 267, but only by understanding game limitations. For example, you cannot aim your ball to angle across the lane. Rather you can roll a straight ball (no spin) or a hook (varied spin) which will hit the pins directly down the lane from where you roll the ball from. So if you roll from the middle, your ball will hit in the middle, with the amount of spin, or no spin, that you release it with.<br /><br />The real limitations of the game are that 1) there is no natural way to aim the ball, it only goes toward the point exactly opposite from where it is dropped, 2) you cannot pull up your scores from previous games, or the current scoreboard for that matter (it only shows between frames), 3) you cannot play against other human players or online opponents, and 4) as mentioned by another reviewer, you cannot track averages or have things like tournaments and special events.<br /><br />It is a nicely done app for what it is, but could use some good user experience QA to make it more real instead of just a time consumer. Because it still needs this kind of improvement, I think 4 stars is slightly generous, but it's a worthwhile download.<br /><br />Samsung Galaxy S2
B005OK722U|2.0|if there was ever a law in hollywood that should be enforced is labeling movies with a previous title. HOSTEL and HOSTEL part 2 are instant dark cult classics that brings the meaning of fear and asks oneself can this really happen?<br />HOSTEL part 3(i have to call it that...) starts off like a ripoff of the hangover throws a BHC symbol and there you go!! The movie doesnt develop. The characters are weak, and the ending was so-so but it doesnt hit the point,<br />If you a have a buck to spend at redbox and liked the other two. go ahead and rent it. its worth a buck<br /><br />If Eli Roth doesnt do anything with the series, LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this cooler at Best Buy which is re-branded under it's Rocketfish label for a few bucks more. Other than the sticker on the fan, it's identical to the Coolermaster Hyper 212.<br /><br />I had problems keeping my 2.66GHz Core2 Quad Q9450 cool with the stock fan for years. I even got brand new high speed case fans. Even after that it was still idling at 70C. I'm surprised it didn't completely burn up with temps like that.<br /><br />I installed this guy, which was quite easy for ATX socket 775 motherboards. I removed the motherboard, but you should always do this when installing the cooler so you can be sure to get a snug fit, and make sure all the pins are secure. When dealing with something as sensitive as a CPU, you always need to be sure. I used Arctic Silver 5, since I had some lying around. It does come with a tube of compound, which I'm sure works at the very least nearly as good. It was large, but for a full size case there's breathing room. It may be problematic for some MicroATX cases and I'm sure it won't fit in MiniITX cases with half-height expansion slots. Also, if your RAM is close to the CPU socket, it may not fit, or you may need to move the closest RAM stick.<br /><br />The construction seemed solid, and it's even got copper heat pipes, which you typically see in more expensive products. In fact, this thing cooled just as good as a $50 solid copper Zalman I had years ago, which kept my old Sledgehammer Opteron at 45C. A C2Q and s940 Opteron both have around the same average operating temps, so to me it's a somewhat valid point of reference.<br /><br />The results speak for themselves, my CPU now idles at around 46C, which doesn't sound amazing since it's not overclocked, but when you consider the fact that it's a 23C improvement from the stock fan, what more can you ask for?<br /><br />The price is well worth it. Sure, the stock worked fine for 4 years even though it sucked, but I've got peace of mind in knowing that my computer won't go upin smoke seeing as it's so old.<br /><br />At it's current price ($27) I would recommend it over a free stock fan, obviously. I would also recommend it over any other aftermarket cooler, unless you find a great deal on a high-end enthusiast cooler.<br /><br />The only time I would stay away from this fan is when the memory banks are no more than an inch from the CPU socket, or smaller cases, unless you feel like rolling the dice.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|would give it 5 if there weren't the update or it won't work choice every month or two, as for the app itself - great, excellent, exactly what I want from this type of app.

B005CKPQNE|5.0|This series has absolutely captivated my wife and me. It starts out kind of humorous, but as it progresses, the writers do a great job of portraying the consequences of the characters' actions. It's very unpredictable - my wife and I always discuss what we think is going to happen, and we're always wrong - which in my opinion equals great writing. You simply never know what's going to happen. Highly recommend!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|For all the people who, like me, LOVED [[ASIN:B002M5E2DW The Secret]], this is the much-needed Secret Application.<br /><br />It's constructed with a simple introduction, naming Gratitude as the fuel of The Secret (law of attraction), then you investigate gratitude in these topics over a 28-day \\"devotional\\" or \\"guide\\" (some topics receive more than one day):<br /><br />*Relationships<br />*Health<br />*Money<br />*Manifestation<br />*canceling negativity<br />*food<br />*everyone<br />*mornings<br />*difference-makers<br />*to-do lists<br />*walking<br />*your heart<br />*breathing<br />*viewing mistakes as blessings<br />*mirrors<br />*memory<br /><br />I was going to write this review after I completed all of them, but I'm only on Day 3, and I really feel fantastic! SO, I wrote it now, deciding to read ahead and visualize myself doing the things (which brought me even MORE good feelings!).<br /><br />These \\"applications\\" are simple \\"awarenes adjustments\\"; if you do them, your endorphin level increases. I've felt it. I have been addicted to various Energy Work applications, from visualization to Reiki to \\"magic\\" to Qigong to Theta meditation to shamanic journeys and more. Because of this, I am always looking for a new way to look at energy, a fresh take to keep my mind stimulated on my path. This book, even though I have not finished it yet, has already helped and will continue to help me along that path.<br /><br />Summary: the attitude of Gratitude is key, and this book helps you apply it. Better than a whole heap of self-help books!
0803729227|5.0|This is one of the best books we have come across in a while. The story is well written and a pleasure to read out loud, the pictures are beautiful, and the moral of this tale of two unusual travel companions is great. Most importantly: our son loves it, and so do I (which really helps considering how often I am called upon to read it to him...).
0984725113|5.0|After reading many books about economy, one gets tired reading about \\"what\\" is happening with names like \\"bubble\\", \\"exuberance\\", \\"boom\\", \\"bust\\", etc. It is the most interesting to know \\"why\\", rather than \\"what\\". This book is among the very few that tries to explain \\"why\\", of what is happening in the world economy. And, in my opinion, this is the best work on this topic.

0061122416|5.0|The novel The Alchemist, written by Paulo Coelho, is an intriguing fable about a boy, Santiago, on his quest to follow his dream. It is an inspiring book for people of all ages. Paulo Coelho, just like the Santiago in the story, followed his dream of becoming an author until his dream was reached. Growing up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Paulo was on a journey following his dream through many different professions in his life; leading up to his profession in writing. He now has reached his dream after writing The Alchemist and continues to write in Rio de Janeiro today.<br /><br />  The Alchemist is a novel that anyone can relate to. This novel doesn't favor any gender or age group, so anyone can read it making it a great novel. The story is based off of Santiago's quest of finding his dream and the experiences learned throughout the trip. In the book Santiago states, \\"There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure\\" (p 141). What Santiago says is very true, it is the fantasy of a dream that helps motivate people through life. Everyone has once had a dream and can relate to the obstacles that one is faced with while trying to pursue that dream. The big part of the novel is how Santiago decided to pursue his dream and didn't let anything or anyone get in the way of it; something many people try to do. This novel is for everyone and really helps one realize the importance of having a dream in their life.<br /><br />  Another aspect of the novel that really makes it interesting to read is Paulo's use of symbolism. Paulo really makes the reader think about the importance of each object and situation that Santiago encounters. A great example of symbolism is the desert that Santiago has to go through in order to reach the pyramids. The desert is full of danger and death because of the tribal wars and tough conditions. This symbolizes the obstacles and road blocks that someone goes through while pursuing their dream, or personal legion. If Santiago is able to get through the desert he will be very close to reaching the pyramids. The Alchemist explains the desert to Santiago, \\"The desert will give you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything on the face of the earth will do that.\\" This is just one of the many lessons that Santiago learned throughout his journey in the deserts. His travel through the desert taught him a lot of knowledge and patience in order to reach the pyramids. The symbol of the desert is just one of many examples of symbolism that makes the reader think.<br /><br />  This fable is something that everyone should read and will definitely enlighten your life. Paulo wrote this book so anyone can relate to the story and also makes the reader really think about what they have read. I definitely recommend this book and hope that you find it as inspiring as I have.
0385534639|5.0|This debut novel by Erin Morgenstern is pure magic. I couldn't get enough, and my only sadness in the reading was that it had to end. I am breathless with anticipation as to what Ms Morgenstern will write next.<br /><br />Whimsical and charming, this book sucked me in from the first moment. That it was written in the present tense threw me a little at first as that's not always my favorite style, but it suited the story somehow, and I quickly forgot my concerns on that point. I appreciated the short chapters/segments as that helped me have points to end off each day when I otherwise would have wanted to keep reading 24/7 until done. This is one of the best books I've read, period.<br /><br />I felt The Night Circus had just the right balance of explanation and mystery. It leaves the reader wanting more, allows you to add your own thoughts and ideas to the story, without feeling as if it's lacking. I loved the main characters, Marco and Celia, and otherwise loved equally the entire supporting cast. If it could be done tastefully and well, I would LOVE to see this story put into movie form.<br /><br />A beautiful read with magical twists and turns, I recommend this book to anyone who will listen. Thank you, Ms Morgenstern - keep the stories coming!

B005HSL626|5.0|My kids downloaded this app and to my surprise I am more addicted to it than they are! It's a lot of fun and I love it when I'm waiting somewhere.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First, as a kindle reader, I don't purchase too many books any more. I find that I enjoy reading a lot of the free books. Giving new authors a chance. But I took a chance when I heard about this series and I'm about 1/2 way through the second book of the series. This has prompted me to write the review as I honestly can't believe how good these books are. The author's writing literally leaps you into the story where you feel a part of District 12. You almost don't need the movie as for me the books already have done that.<br /><br />Some might line this up under the genre of sci-fi, but to me it is more a blending of past and a possible future. Although the concept is sickening and barbaric, it is not unrealistic in the realm of what humans will do to each other. More importantly, the author handles it with just the right amount of detail to make it appear in your mind, but not too much so that it is over the top.<br /><br />The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising against the Capital, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could be desert, forest or water with unbelievable and cruel obstacles controlled by the Capital. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, it is clear at the end of the Hunger Games that more is to come. The Capital has been made to look bad. I have to say at this point the author could have went in a million different directions, but for me I was really surprised. That doesn't happen to often and congratulations to Suzanne Collins for writing such an enjoyable read. I'm hooked and can't wait to finish the entire series ----or may not, I almost think I'll be disappointed as the characters are so likeable I just know I'll want to keep reading wondering what the far off future will be like.<br /><br />If you have never read this series I highly recommend it.
B006KSAPV0|3.0|It is good to see Antonio Banderas working once again with director Pedro Almodovar, especially since Almodovar seems to bring out the best of Banderas as an actor. The film is certainly a must for Almodovar fans, but,  unfortunately, this is not one of his best films. Discussing the film's plot would be a disservice to anyone who has not seen the film: as other reviewers have noted, the less one knows about the film going into it, the better. The Skin I Live In is a bit confusing at first (deliberately so), but by the time we finally get to where we supposed to be going Almodovar seems to have painted himself into a corner and has little direction to go except for the predictable melodrama that ensues. The film contains the wonderful trademark Almodovar use of color (and in the case of this film, lack of color in many scenes to enhance the notion of sterility in all its many forms), but what it sadly lacks are the usual touches of Almodovar playfulness and, especially, humanity. Give it a try, but don't expect it to be in the category of Law Od Desire, Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown, All About My Mother, Talk To Her, or Volver.

As the mystery surrounding the manuscript unravels Diana discovers that the future of all creatures is in danger.<br /><br />This is a thick novel, yet it feels that it is over in a moment. Unexpected twists and turns cover the pages. A condensed history lesson is comprised within the story. Do not feel surprised to find yourself lost at times amongst the historical fact only to find enlightenment a few pages down the line. This is a trilogy. This first installment ended at a place where a commercial break would fit nicely, leaving me yearning for more. The next book, Shadow of Night, isn't due out until July of this year. So if you don't like waits, put off reading this book until the entire trilogy comes out. I assure you once you enter Diana's life it won't be easy to get untangled.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|I saw Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn open in theaters in March 1987 & have remained a rabid fan ever since.  Does this blu-ray of the cult classic impress?  Yes it does!<br /><br />PROs:<br />Secured cult classic status [this film you should see before you die]<br />Sam Raimi broke new ground with this film in style & substance<br />Bruce Campbell is an awesome B movie actor [His character Ash has been copied by other movies & video games alike--Duke Nukem comes to mind]<br />Filled with countless one-liners [\\"You're going down!\\" & \\"Groovie!\\"]<br />All zombie/horror films where the hero uses a chainsaw owes a debt to this movie<br />Evil laughing demonically possessed deer's head<br />The Necronomicon Ex-Mortis is the coolest horror prop of all time<br />Possessed hand that flips Ash the bird<br />The remixed sound is outstanding<br />The special features are great, especially the making of Evil Dead 2 [It's Ted Raimi in the possessed old lady makeup]<br /><br />CONs:<br />The stop-motion animation & minitures don't hold up well to HD viewing [It was decent for 1987]<br /><br />NOTE:  Sam Raimi's director calling card is to have the 1973 Oldsmobile that Ash drives in all of his films.  Much like Stanley Kubrick always had a bathroom scene in his films, Raimi includes this car.  It's in Spiderman driven by Uncle Ben when he is killed.  The next film \\"Army of Darkness\\" is also pretty good, but not groundbreaking like this one.  I am not really a fan of the original Evil Dead.  I've read that this edition is better than the original blu-ray release, but I have not seen that one to compare.  Overall, you must see this film!

B0060Q962Q|5.0|Awesome Connect Four game. Just like when we were kids. The graphics are nice and different themes are  too. Definately worth it if you used to play and liked the real board game. I do agree with the reviewer that online multiplay would be great.
0062060562|4.0|From the moment you open this book you will be drug into  Christina's world of confusion - who is this woman in the mirror, who is the man she woke up next to in that strange bed this morning, who can she trust and who should never trusted?

You will find yourself cheering for Christine as she has a memory even though that memory will be erased by the time she wakes.  Even if you figure the mystery out before Christine does, the end remains gripping.
B006UG90RM|4.0|So much off-topic rambling in these reviews.  Time to be honest.<br /><br />First off, I'm 40.  I grew up rocking out to VH out of absurdly big boom boxes and wearing out cassettes with too much rewinding.  Sure, I blasted 1984 from the back of the bus during a school field trip, but I also wore out 'Women and Children First' on my walkman and in my room while playing Intellivsion.  I have every VH album prior to the VHIII farce.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yes, I've also followed the soap opera (DLR, Eddie, Sammy, etc.) from a distance through the years.  I don't care for them personally.  I am not a \\"Sammy\\" guy or a \\"DLR\\" diehard.  I don't compare this to Chickenfoot.  Irrelevant.  I like rock.  I had low expectations for this as a money-grab.  I've accepted that it is just that, in principle.  However, I bought the CD and kept an open mind.<br /><br />It's good.  There is no denying it.  I listened to it straight through three times the first 48 hours I had it, and then listened to each song a few more times out of sequence.  It's solid, heavy, and suprisingly good.  I won't bore you with a breakdown of each track, but I will say that it does exactly what I want it to do....it rocks!  I play it in the garage while I'm tinkering around.  I play it at work while I'm cubicle-dwelling.  I play it in the car while I'm cruising.  I play it at the end of the day while I tip a few back.<br /><br />Sure, it has DLR's vocal range exposed and his sing-song talkie fluff at times.  Sure, it has some production issues (flatness, etc.).  Sure, I miss MA's backing vocals, but damn it, as a whole, it's well worth it.  If you like VH, buy it.  If you like rock, buy it.  I play it for my kids (5 & 9), so that they hear it next to Fair Warning and my other \\"oldies\\" and guess what, it holds up.  They like it, I like it.  It's not going to change the world, it's not the greatest ever, but hell, it fills a void in the current release apocalypse that we're stuck in.  I'll leave politics to others.  I'll leave personal grudges to others.  Instead, I'll keep this in my rotation and I'll stay frosty!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have used yahoo for a long time so that is why i wanted it on my kindle and i have enjoyed it very much.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you are looking for a dark and gritty medieval fantasy show, this is it. It has deep character development, intrigue, and great plots. I've read the books, and I was greatly pleased that they came out with the show. I highly recommend watching this if you haven't already, especially if you like dark fantasy.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|I found the first and last sections to be incredibly compelling. The middle was good, though not quite as compelling. I felt like it took me a little while to get into it each time I picked it up, but then read tons in each sitting. However, because it was 650+ pages long, that still meant I had to \\"re-get into it\\" several times. It was worth it, though, I'd say. The plot/point was all about the character development, in my opinion, and I thought there could have been some tweaks, and that a little bit of it probably could have been left out (I get the ode to medicine and I liked the suspenseful parts, but I do not need every medical detail just b/c the author is a doctor), but overall, it was well done.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|it looks nice and is made of high quality material. The little \\"bend the back and tuck it in the little notch\\" thing isn't very stable so unless you're sitting at a table and not touching your kindle it won't hold up.
0307956350|5.0|The spy novel genre has just been altered, and there is a new kid on the block, who has moved in with a story that is unforgettable.  There is nothing that is derivative about Chris Pavone's The Expats.  In what is sure to be one of the best books of the year, Pavone delivers a spot-on, carefully constructed plot line that finds genius in the simplicity in the quiet stories of everyday life.  With a lead character that is instantly likeable, despite her dark past, the story is compassionately told.<br /><br />This is not a story about an ex-CIA agent that cannot out run her past.  It is about a woman who decides to build a new future for herself and her family by changing her present position in life.  It is about the sacrifices and decisions a mother makes to protect her children, and how sometimes that means not knowing what the right choice is; the mistakes that are made cannot be erased, but the damage can be minimized to the best of our ability.<br /><br />What struck me about this book is how poignantly Kate's role as a mother, and her attempted domestication is portrayed.  After reading, it came as a surprise that Chris Pavone is a man.  Perhaps I should not have been surprised, as it makes me sound biased.  However, it is rare to see such a full, complex, and real female lead written by a man with such believability.<br /><br />When I received The Expats to read, I really did not know that much about it.  Only the basic premise that Kate, the lead character, was involved in the CIA and it was based in Luxembourg.  Although I want to share everything about this book, I think the best way to read it is to approach it without too much insight.  Just know that you will have a hard time putting it down once you begin, as the story unfolds and the decisions that are made is not always what are expected.  This is truly the most subtly written spy novel that I have ever read- and therein lays the magic and beauty behind the story.  Pavone hit it spot-on with the beginning quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: \\"Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies.\\"
B004SOR4H6|4.0|When I got the update it asked what browser I wanted to use and neither option would work. I realized it was running two different versions of Twitter, one web and one for Fire, so I un installed both and re installed Twitter for Fire and all is good now.
0307473473|3.0|I did like this book. I think the characters were well developed, the story was great. However I felt like it took too long to get going, and the ending was a bit drawn out for me. I think there was quite a bit from the beginning and the ending that could have been cut and this still would have been a good story. I do have to warn you that it can be a bit hard to read. There are a few scenes that were a bit graphic, and not in a romantic graphic sort of way. So if you have trouble reading gruesome material you may not care for this book.<br /><br />The story, once it gets going is pretty good. There's so much going on in the story but having the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance as the backbone to everything else was a great tool. I wanted to find out what happened and who was responsible for it. There were so many twists that I didn't think it would ever be all sorted out! I wanted to see what was going to happen with everything else too. My favorite scene is when Lisbeth gets revenge - It was very disturbing, but at the same time I was so glad that she did what she did! I don't think I would have handled things the same way she did, but I'm not like her. She did what she had to do to and I'm pretty sure she got her point across!<br /><br />I really liked Lisbeth she was a great character. I've never known anyone like her, she was so different, but I really connected with her. I wish she would have been in the story more, it seemed to not focus so much on her as opposed to the other characters. She didn't play as central of a role as I would have wanted her to - given the title refers to her, it seems she would have been a bit more involved. Mikael was an ok character. He was well developed. Although I was just kind of indifferent about him. I didn't hate him, but I didn't really like him either. He just seemed to be kind of selfish and ditzy. The ending with him kind of upset me, although it wasn't really a surprise, just showed his true colors - yet again.<br /><br />Overall it was a pretty good book. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I will be picking up the other two in this series..<br /><br />Overall it was a pretty good book. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I will be picking up the other two in this series.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes comparitive research a pleasure. In particular having access to the Greek without. Having to have a desk filled with multiple volumes open saves countless hours when trying to catch the subtle shades of differences between versions.  How. I wish I had something this valuable when I was a student many years ago. This should be mandatory for any serious student of scriptures. Thanks ffor making this available!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I am not sure why all the negative feed back!!!! fun game and easy to play...... great on my kindle fire
B004GNFSO0|5.0|this is a great book.  It is much better than the movie.  It kept my interest from the first page and was really hard to put down. It shows the inhumanity to man and the determed mind set of those value freedom.  This is a story that doesn't rely on blood and sex.  It is real refreshing.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I used this app befire they moved it to Amazon. niw I have to pay for it. thats just bs
B0071PS7AC|1.0|The other reviewers just don't rralize that flicking isn't necessary to play. If you pull the ball back, you can just release it, and it'll be thrown. That being said, there is a spot on the floor that will give you a strike 100% of the time, since you can simply position the ball over it and let go. The spot is 2 or 3 pixels left of the line between the central diamond and the diamond to the right of the center diamond. Move your ball there, draw back to a spot that puts 1/2 ball between your ball and the furthest back you can pull. Release. You'll get a strike. It took me maybe 45 seconds to find the exact spot.<br /><br />To fix this, the developer should require that a swiping action be made to toss the ball, since a swipe is a physical action that is difficult to reproduce 100% of the time.

B0063GORYU|4.0|It seems a little more challenging than the Windows version, but every bit as addicting. The graphics are better than another I tried on my phone.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Perfect for the heavy Kindle Fire! I have a three year old that gets her little paws all over my \\"book\\" and this cover has probably saved many falls from destroying my beloved Fire. $30 seems like a bit of an expenditure, but worth the hassle of finding the most durable and convenient cover. Simply the best!

0307719219|5.0|Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have teamed up to write a broad reaching work that combines political science, history, and economics in order to attempt to explain why nations fail. Rather than relying on tired, outdated, and offensive theories such as geography, culture, or outright ignorance of impoverished populations. The theory advanced in this book is far more simpler, and in my view much more plausible. The theory states that poor societies are poor because political power is narrowly concentrated in the hands of elites who are more concerned with their own power rather than society at large. Prosperous societies have widely distributed political and economic rights throughout levels of society rather than on a narrow elite.<br /><br />The authors than go about providing a plethora of evidence for their theory. Thus, the theory is well supported. However, the history tends to wander and shoot off in random directions at points that make it difficult to follow--in spite of the many engaging and occasionally humorous anecdotes. But it doesn't detract from the overall message of the book that exploitive political and economic institutions are a cause of poor societies. Blending information from different disciplines can be difficult, but I praise the authors for creating a readable, yet comprehensive book that is my favorite of 2012, so far.
B0007TKNII|1.0|I am very disappointed in this production. None of them could even sing except for Minnie Driver and SHE WAS DUBBED!!!!!!!!!! They probably should have dubbed everyone else. Patrick Wilson was just okay. His voice was a plain and vanilla sounding tone. Emmy Rossum had such a small voice that if she actually performed the role on stage without any cuts she would blow her voice out after the first performance. She has no vocal technique whatsoever. I think Gerard Butler is a great actor but he should never sing again. His voice sounded very strained and unpleasant to listen to. If you want to see a high quality production, I highly recommend the 25th anniversary DVD from Royal Albert Hall.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a great game so far.The point of most games are to play through and unlock stuff so those who don't like that quit crying and just delete the game. Overall great game so far.

B006UKC566|2.0|I DONT USALLY WRITE REVIEWS ABOUT MOVIES BUT BOY I JUST NEEDED TO SAY SOMETHING.I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS MOVIE FOR SOME TIME NOW AND COULDDNT WAIT TO BUY IT ON 3D BLURAY, I WATCHED ABOUT 45 MINS OF IT LAST NIGHT IN 3D AND HAD TO TURN IT OFF BC HOW BAD THE STORY LINE WENT, IT JUMPED ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT IT DIDNT MAKE ANY SENSE WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS FILM WASNT SHOT IN 3D BUT WAS SHOT IN 2D AND CONVERTED INTO 3D WHICH IS A GARBAGE WAY TO MAKE A 3D FILM, AND TO TOP IT OFF THIS FILM IS VERY DARK, NOT A GOOD WAY TO WATCH A 3D FILM, NOTHING POPS AND THE DEPTH IS VERY CRAPPY, I EVEN TOOK OFF MY GLASSES AND THE PICTURE WAS VERY CLEAR, I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM AND SAVE YOUR MOVIE FOR ANOTHER 3D MOVIE
B003L77FYS|5.0|LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!  It is wonderful to be able to go back and watch the shows without commercial interruption.  I enjoy the comments as well!
B000H5TH1Q|3.0|The story is about a forsaken actor that is set-up to witness a murder, but whose murder and who set him up?<br /><br />This is not the first movie to have the murder of one of a set of women as the theme. Both Larry Kasdan's 'Body Heat' and Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' do exactly the same job and well worth imitating. However, the 'Body Double' story plays absent a very necessary amount of credibility. The film simply lacks drama.<br /><br />The story is suspenseful, mysterious, touches on Vampire and porn film-making, and conveniently provides sex as the substitute for drama.<br /><br />Overall the movie is entertaining and good. But as far as combining the devices of film making together into one whole, like Hitchcock and Kasdan did, Brian De Palma did not quite get it.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|There has been a lot of talk on the package for this set but I must say that I personally have not seen any problem with it. DVD's arrived without a scratch and I can't see them getting scratch unless is my own doing. Like with any other set, if treated right you should have many years of enjoyment with no problems. This set is must cheaper (payed $28 for my set) and worth the buy.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I really love this game! play a solo round or two to feel it out but very slick and fun once you figure it out! Pretty good game, and free today.
B00065GX64|1.0|Reality check:    Plays like a simplest TV show. Main character is NOT developed. A highly overrated movie not even having good cult elements.  It has \\"early works\\" historical value only/mainly.    Shows the artists in their first stages, as persons who have just gotten a camera in their hand and do not yet understand the need for playing out detailed subtle story elements. You feel like you are watching a show made for children.    The worst American TV shows are this good or better.    A classic 1 star.     I rely on Amazon reviews to help me purchase. The dishonest slant of reviews making this something special must be cleared up by someone. The show is a simplistic \\"early work\\" before the artists became \\"great\\". I can not afford to purchase everything an artist ever did including the bad early works.     Check out the comments section on the word mediocracy if you want more on this \\"too positive review\\" phenomena.
B00005B1W5|4.0|Tribute is a fine music piece. Its a nice easy listening concert. Great landscapes, great music. This concert is for music lover!

B00005JLEJ|1.0|Kurosawa's Seven Samurai was one of the greatest films ever made showing the life of a village that will be destroyed without the help of the Samurai; but this film lacks in all areas.    The digital transfer looks too \\"real\\" having that cheap video tv like sharpness (was it shot on video?). The color lacked the range of film (even film transferred to video). The brights were too bright nearly over-driving the TV circuitry no mater how I adjusted my $3,000 USD TV set.    The military history aspect shows the leaders as fools that just advance into gunfire to be killed not having any strategy. One reviewer says this is due to cutting of important war scenes from this Lucas-&-Coppola version. In that vein it is like an American liberal's view of war that just stupidly sends people out to die without any strategy in the activity thus the war scenes fall flat seeming dumb. Generally it lacks some of the expected Asian point of view throughout thus it looses some of its essential cultural fascination.    It has no love plot really, just a reference to main character's mistresses. Maybe the older writer Kurosawa does not see the need for romance but a younger audience would want it. A shame to miss the Asian innocent beauty character in the women.    The story lacks complexity early on and when it does get some later it is poorly developed and obvious like a child's movie intellectually. Was this written by a high-school kid? The body double is essentially \\"thrown into the streets\\" a foolish act when he has so much insider information; are these people really that dumb; could this stupidity be historically accurate?    This is typical of some late works in the arts where great artists lack whatever-it-is-they-had-in-the-beginning and now just do technically correct poor art be it music or movies.    The music soundtrack is literally as bad as 1970's television. No orchestra here but just tracks laid down from \\"library\\" pre-made music. Some of it sounded Spanish in originas a horn in the background as one would expect in an old western.    Overall an eclectic mix of technique that comes together like a low budget (under $500,000) TV movie of the week. UG! All the high ratings probably come from a film class at some school that is obsessed with Kurosawa's work.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|This movie is such a great family film excellent for showing what it takes to be a father! Absolutely would recommend this movie to anyone! Really excellent quality to rent as well

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games movie will be released later this month. It is one of the most anticipated films of 2012. One would not be able to truly understand and appreciate the movie without reading this book. P.S I highly recommend the second and the third book as well :D

I was hoping to be able to look anlt a menu or throw the ball easily but noooo I have to pull it back to get it to go forward where's the sense in that most other bowling apps I play you flick the ball forwards to throw these controls are weird this app sucks don't get it

B000MD9UJC|5.0|My old AA mini mag was ruined by the cutting fluids I work around at a machine shop. The plastic light holding guts cracked into many pieces.....so I bought this replacement and also there is a guy on eBay selling replacement lenses cheap. I thought I would miss the focus part of the light but no problem. Also the on/off button is great at work for when you only have 1 hand free up inside a machine! Sometimes the light switches on when I put it in my holster but it's no big deal. I love the light it puts out compared to the old style. I like that I don't have to throw my old light away and instead made it better!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|By far, this is one of my favorite books!<br /><br />The characters are fantastic and the dialogue is great. I love the witty banter between Clary and Will, and really could not have asked for more... If only more books sucked me in like this one!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love everything about this series .  These characters are well defined and I got carried away with what emotions they were having. I can't count how many times I started crying and had to walk away from the book. I never got bored or angry with the way the writer went with the  characters actions.  And I especially loved the ending of the final book. I'm glad they are making a movie of this series.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|The positive: the premise of the story was good, the writing was great, and much of the plot line was very good. I liked the characters, and I can relate to Abby. The characters were well formed.<br />The negative: honestly- I felt like I was in high school again reading some of the dramatic turns. There is too much back and forth, breaking up and making up. The weakest parts of the storyline is when they break up. Each break-up is clogged by poor communication and pride, which does happen in real life, but if they are so truly in love, why would Abby let pride get in the way of true happiness? She is incredibly immature at points, as is Travis, which doesn't give much credibility to the happy ever after.<br />I cautiously recommend this book. I am looking forward to seeing what this author does next, and I hope McQuire writes a more mature story, because I truly did enjoy her writing.
1609611543|4.0|We found out several months ago that our daughter has celiac disease (CD) and the whole family went gluten free (or mostly GF for some)  as of Jan. 1.  I started reading this about 6 weeks into our gluten free journey.  My CD daughter and I have been strictly GF.  My CD daughter is asymptomatic, but she did crave and live on pasta, as he mentions in Wheat Belly.  We are at week 10 and she has noticed no changes to her health or feeling of well being.  Follow-up blood tests are in a month, so we will see if antibody levels are down and damage to her intestines has stopped. I had to chuckle at the claims of immediate weight loss. After an initial loss of 2-3 pounds. I have gained that plus 5 pounds in the last 10 weeks.  To be fair, before reading this book, I made a herculean effort to make meals as normal as possible and have used every grain, starch and GF flour I could get my hands on the last 2 months.  I am rethinking the use of these flours/starches as the result of reading Wheat Belly.<br /><br />That said, daughter #2 has type 1 diabetes (T1D) and I found the intricate information about insulin production/use and glycemic load to be interesting and valuable.  Although I have read it before, it took this book to make me honestly look at the diet of my T1D daughter.  From her initial diagnosis 9 years ago, we have been told that she can eat whatever as long as insulin is given to cover it.  There has never been a discussion about limiting the amount or type of carbs eaten.  In investigating myself the link between celiacs and type 1 and am also convinced that there is some link other than the genetic HLA link.  Does gluten consumption lead to leaky gut, which leads to the body attacking invaders that make it through the barrier?  T1D daughter also has psoriasis and I strongly believe going GF helped her skin, but she only lasted GF for 4-5 weeks before finding social situations too difficult to mange when she didn't \\"have to\\" be GF.<br /><br />Going GF is difficult and based on my family's experience so far, I don't believe the vast majority of people will see a great improvement in their daily lives. HOWEVER, I do believe gluten intolerance manifests itself differently in different people.  Besides digestive issues and dermatitis herpetiformis there are other issues that just have not been clearly documented yet.<br /><br />Is going GF a quick weight loss or cure-all-your-ails diet?  No.  Does going GF greatly help many people?  I believe so, often internally in ways they cannot see or feel.  Wheat Belly reveals some of the science behind gluten and insulin and their effects on the body. Do all the \\"facts\\" ring true? No, but the information has made my GF journey easier and clearer.  It raises questions about the food we eat and the political/economic decisions behind the foods we are encouraged to eat for a healthy diet.  I recommend it and warn you that you will never look at your morning bagel the same way again.

B002T44ZYW|5.0|I love this entire series, but the 1st book, LA Candy, is my favorite to date.<br />The book itself isn't about Lauren Conrad growing up, but I feel she has grown up so much and written this a book as a result. It gives a great look into \\"reality\\" and reminds us that what we consider \\"reality\\" on tv would be better considered entertainment only, & reminds us those people are people as well.

B003FK8V7G|2.0|One of the things that I like about Amazon is getting the recommendations of other albums, based on what I buy or own. That has turned me on to tons of great music that I would not have discovered otherwise. This album was one of those picks, and after reading postive reviews I decided to order it. Well ... I'm still waiting to be impressed. I love Springsteen, Southside Johnny, and bands like the Iron City Houserockers. Working man's rock. Another reviewer threw in Thin Lizzy and the Jam as comparisons. I love those bands too, so how could I go wrong with the Gaslight Anthem? But I feel like I did. The songs on this album just sound too derivitve to me. Some sort of play-by-the-numbers blueprint for making an album. Nothing daring or brilliant. Ho hum. They wear their influences on their sleeves, and those are good influences, but I can't say that there is anything remotely original, or memorable, on this album.

1451627289|5.0|You either love him or hate him. King puts out a story or two a year. Some dark and thrilling others you wonder if he needs to pick back up the bottle again. 11/22/63 is a great novel. It's another one of his heavy books. I've read all of his massive novels and with some you get to the end and feel disappointed. You won't with this novel. It has a different type of ending that doesn't leave it up to your own imagaination. This is probably due to the fact that he let his write son, Joe Hill, rewrite the ending. It does go over a lot of material repetitively but then again when you are dealing with \\"time travel\\" then you really do need many pages to get it right. You will fall in love with the characters and you will want for more. It will leave you satisfied. There are lots of suspesneful elements as well as a love story in the middle of it. Of course the main character is an author. Aren't most of the main characters? Write what you know! Haha. Buy the book. It is more than worth it. I bought it brand new off the shelves and paid a fortune. Find a used copy and get to reading! Thanks constant reader.

1451673442|5.0|This series of books has completely changed my life. I went from living in a 1 bedroom apartment with no heat to now living in a multi million dollar mansion in 3 years by implimenting what these books teach.  I'm not saying that by buying the books you will become a millionaire, BUT if you can, not just read the words, but fully understand them, AND impliment them in to your life, you can and will have literally anything your heart desires.  I already knew that by being grateful, you would reeive more in your life, Carol Tuttle teaches you this in her book \\"Remembering Your Wholeness\\". By changing your thoughts to things you want, rather than things you don't want, and by being grateful instead of worried and stressed, you receive SO MUCH in life...not just peace of mind, but also things in the phsyical world.  I am living proof, I will forever and always be grateful for Rhonda Byrne and her amazing books.  They woke me up and gave me insight and tools on how to change my situation in my time of need.  I will never \\"Want\\" again, I have it all at my fingertips.  Thanks Rhonda, you are a amazing woman, and it shows through your books!

B001UV4XUQ|5.0|\\"This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front this is not a love story\\". That is how (500) Days of Summer is introduced and it holds true in what is easily one of my favorite movies of 2009. This is not a conventional romantic comedy. Instead it is one of the most honest stories about relationships I can remember ever being on screen and it really hit home.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom Hansen, a greetings card writer with aspirations of being an architect. When Summer arrives as a new employee at the office the start of their relationship begins. The movie essentially jumps back and forth between different days and the events that took place in a 500 day span. The level of excitement early is contrasted in a completely unique way with the breakdown and emotion that comes later on. Really the story is about discovery and dealing with the unexpected things that life brings.<br /><br />The main characters have an immense level of chemistry that really sells the story. They fit well together and are completely believable in their interactions and the development of their relationship. There is some comic relief also from the supporting characters but they don't stand out as being placed in just for that reason but instead they are along as the people who are turned to for advice despite what they maybe lack in expertise. While they do provide some laughs the parts that really got me were in relating to the situations and things said between Tom and Summer.<br /><br />I would not consider this a \\"chick flick\\" because it will resonate with everyone. Most individuals will be able to relate to the situations and emotions involved based on a relationship they have had or an opportunity missed out on in the past. In a way watching this movie was cathartic and I left it with a sense of optimism. But that isn't based on a contrived ending. Instead it is about knowing how difficult things can be but that eventually life does go on and acceptance is reached.<br /><br />(500) Days of Summer is worth at least a rent if not a purchase. The genuine nature of the story is unmatched and the performances were completely honest. It truly connected with me in a way that few movies do. I can only wish that more did.s reached.<br /><br />(500) Days of Summer is worth at least a rent if not a purchase.

B005LAIH2W|3.0|The writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs have greatly influenced sci-fi over the last 100 years. With John Carter the long road of taking the series of novels to the big screen has finally been realized. The result is a decidedly mixed bag and one that won't exactly hold direct appeal to any particular age or demographic.<br /><br />Based on the first novel \\"A Princess of Mars\\" the story centers on John Carter who finds himself transported to Barsoom (Mars) where he becomes involved in a war between factions on the planet. While he has little interest in taking sides he eventually forms allegiances while attempting to find his way back home.<br /><br />The film starts on Earth and really struggles there. The scenes are dull and the relevance of them are totally unclear. Once on Barsoom it begins to get more interesting though even then the sense of discovery isn't as compelling as would have been anticipated. Eventually the action picks up, the story gets its hooks in, and improvement comes through the second half of the movie which delivers a surprisingly strong conclusion considering the earlier struggles in getting the audience emotionally involved.<br /><br />While that sense of discovery is lacking there is feeling of wonder and imagination that shines through. Given that the source material is so old it doesn't always translate well but that forward-looking nature is easily identified. There are some decent laughs to be had but it's generally focused on providing adventure and it does a sufficient job of that.<br /><br />The special effects are suitable when keeping in mind that they're trying to convey scenes written 100 years ago and that means they won't always come across as realistic as one would imagine now. Outside of that though the alien creatures look great. The 3D is ultimately unnecessary - adding some depth to scenes but otherwise not enhancing the experience significantly.<br /><br />Despite some dreadful spots - which early in the film include jarring scene transitions - somehow I ended up enjoying the film as a whole. It's a tough one to recommend, and I suspect there will be opinions that stretch completely across the board, but there is a unique nature about it that struck me as being commendable. As an origin story John Carter struggles to gain traction but eventually shows some promise which would bode well for any possible sequels to come.ng scene transitions - somehow I ended up enjoying the film as a whole.

B0071PS7AC|3.0|This game is ok but there is no incentive to keep playing. The money you win cant buy upgrades or anything else. If you roll a bad ball you can just undo it.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|While 21 Jump Street is based on the popular '80s TV series it isn't a straight remake - rather it presents a modern day take on the concept of police officers infiltrating crime rings by going undercover within places like high schools. The film takes a much more comedic angle, while mixing some action in, and it all really works.<br /><br />Two inept cops - played by Jonah Hill (who also co-wrote the script) and Channing Tatum - get reassigned to the 21 Jump Street program and are tasked with finding and bringing down the supplier of a new synthetic drug.<br /><br />While they have become friends on the force in the past Jenko (Tatum) was the popular kid in high school while Schmidt (Hill) was the one who got picked on. Amusingly what represented \\"popularity\\" years before has changed and that throws a wrench into their expectations.<br /><br />Though their friendship is never completely established or entirely credible (maybe the only gripe I would have but ultimately an unnecessary one) there is a sense that the two genuinely like each other. How they play off one another, as they go through various experiences and challenges throughout the film, is flat out fun to watch. Basing their investigation on a fictional drug makes it especially hilarious as the characters and audience go along for the ride together learning about its effects and influence on events.<br /><br />Never having considered myself a fan of Channing Tatum he impressed with some great comedic timing - the movie was so good that it actually made me really like him. Meanwhile Jonah Hill brought exactly what one would expect out of him, Brie Larson was endearing as a love interest, and Ice Cube and Rob Riggle flat out stole some scenes. There are also some big payoffs in the way of cameos.<br /><br />21 Jump Street did a fantastic job of playing against expectations and cliches while providing some truly hilarious moments throughout. It's the funniest film I've seen since The Hangover - not only did it deliver all the laughs but it was more clever and simply a more complete movie. There isn't much more anyone could ask for out of 21 Jump Street and hopefully it's just the start of a franchise that would actually be deserving of one.d it deliver all the laughs but it was more clever and simply a more complete movie.

B006ZCWU5K|2.0|I've been a fan for over thirty years and have seen him in concert about 10 times. The music on this album doesn't sound like the E Street Band because they didn't offer much to it. That was a major mistake, Bruce is always at his best with the group that helped make him a rock icon. I don't want to hear Irish folk songs or ones that speak out against rich bankers. Give me rock songs and ballads that he has always done so well. Bruce, if you want to be angry at someone speak out against terrorists and killers, instead of the rich which you are part of. Another thing that ruins this record is the background female vocalists. We don't need to hear a choir on every song. 3 of the best songs aren't even new: \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" \\"American Land,\\" and \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" have been performed for years and have appeared on live CD's and DVD's in a superior way. One of my favorite songs is \\"You've Got It,\\" because it sounds like a classic Springsteen tune. I think most old Springsteen fans cringed when they heard \\"Rocky Ground\\" and it's hip-hop rap mess.<br /> \\"Magic,\\" \\"The Promise,\\" and \\"The Rising\\" are all great albums that belong in any Springsteen fan's collection along with the \\"Tracks\\" box set. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" takes its place with \\"The Seeger Sessions,\\" \\"Devils and Dust,\\" \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" \\"Working on a Dream,\\" and even \\"Nebraska\\" as efforts you won't want to listen to. I hope he doesn't perform too many of the songs from it on the upcoming tour.

B006ZBRMOU|2.0|May I suggest to Amazon that the title \\"Fifty Shades Freed (Fifty Shades Trilogy)\\" should be changed as it is extremely misleading.  I bought this on my kindle the other day, thinking I was purchasing the \\"Fifty Shades Trilogy\\" (meaning books 1, 2, and 3) as the title suggests.  I am 20% through \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\", just now realizing that I am on the last book of the trilogy, rather than on the first book of the trilogy.  This is very irritating because now I know what ultimately happens.  Anyway, Amazon,  you should take \\"Fifty Shades Trilogy\\" out of the title so this doesn't happen to other people.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|Okay, so first off: I don't have kids. I'm 30, love animals, am developing a keen interest in metazoan evolution, including that of the big reptiles like the dinosaurs, and basically I just had to indulge the science nerd kid in me because these figures look AWESOME!!!<br /><br />A friend of mine wanted to go into a local toy store in the mall. I followed and soon found a host of these toys. I purchased a velociraptor at the store, fell in love (as much as one can with a figure velociraptor), and just had to find more to build a collection. So this was my first purchase from Papo online and I have to say I was not disappointed in the least when the Allosaurus arrived yesterday.<br /><br />I can't say much about durability because I won't be playing with this figure. For me, it's decorative. But as decoration, it gets the kid in me all giddy again.

I thought When Christ and his Saints Slept was awesome, but Sunne in Splendor has definitely outpaced it. This one is going to be an all time Favorite. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in historical fiction.
0142419400|5.0|If you've read my previous contemporary reviews you'll know I'm not fond of the contemporaries. Thats just me. The reasons this has been sitting on my shelf for so long is that a) yes, it's contemporary and b) I've read a lot of school based books and I needed a break and c) I love the Paranormal genre and would gladly put those first. Sadly for me I missed out on reading a great book since I received it in March 2011!<br />So, you've read the synopsis and possibly even read the book. The first thing to say is that the first preson present tense really works well with this style of book. It's a style I'm getting more and more used to but learning to enjoy all the more.<br />So, Anna moves to a new school in Paris because of her horrid father and his insistance that she'll gain worldly wisdom from attending a school in a foreign country. Why Paris is chosen as that school is never really discussed. Probably because its a School of America. At the end of the day this isn't relevant at all as all of the characters are American origin.<br />Anna as a character was extremely likeable, and her new friends were easy to relate to. She fell into a group of friends quickly and stayed being herself, and they immediately included her.<br />Etienne St Clair is also a likeable character but certainly insecure when it comes to girls. His reluctance to end his previous relationship but be so friendly towards Anna gave me concern. Mainly because if it was me I would have insisted that he make a choice. Not straight away but especially after the Christmas holidays. Sadly Anna and Etienne face that age old problem that we all suffer from. The inability to really talk about their feelings. Yes, they play and joke around one another, they enjoy each other's company when they're in Paris and remain close friends. But the barrier is always there and Anna waited almost a whole school year before exploding at him after a drunken night out. Kudos to her for finally venting her feelings but I was frustrated it took so long! Although I did also cheer a little!<br /><br />Of course there's no end of complications that occur throughout. They start building up from the beginning when Anna realises her first friend Meredith has unspoken feelings towards Etienne. And Dave comes into the story early on as a would be rival. Josh and Rashmi have problems with their relationship that sink further and Rashmi's upset because of Etienne's girlfriend.<br /><br />But what I loved most besides the gradual growth of tension was Anna's acceptance that she isn't a perfect person, or a perfect friend. From the beginning we see her flaws and watch them grow but she makes amends when she realises them. Anna is couragous and towards the end we see her determination to help those around her, especially Etienne.<br /><br />Overall, you've probably guessed it - I loved this book. So much that I'm going to buy Perkins other book very soon! I can't wait!was frustrated it took so long!

B004RKXHZY|4.0|This was a whole lot different from Anna and the French Kiss, and almost a role reversal to that story. Lola is a gifted designer with a rock star wannabe boyfriend, two dads, no significant mother figure in her life and a fantastic best friend. Life is complicated enough with her boyfriend being so much older than her (her fathers don't approve wholeheartedly), but she expresses herself through her clothes and the costumes she wears, and she never wears the same outfit twice!<br /><br />Everything's hunky-dory and not so different from any other teenagers life. But when the Bell twins move back next door, Lolas life begins to unravel, like the seams of her creations and everything changes.<br /><br />What I loved about this book is my wrong preconceptions. When I first started it I thought Lola dressed the way she did becaue her mother was a non-existent entity in her life and she was brought up by two loving fathers. Possibly a reaching hand to empower the woman inside her and show off her feminine side. But a little way into the story we find out that Lola has always been this way. Wanting to create beautiful designs and wear them with pride. It's part of who she is - Lady Gaga style.<br /><br />Another preconception was that the Bell twins were almost perfect. As we examine the story we realise that Calliope as insecure as Lola despite her perfect skin and perfect body. Her achievements as a figure skater have diminished Cricket's significance in the family, he goes where she goes, and because of this I feel even more sorry for him as he really is a genuine nice guy.<br /><br />Max started off as a great character, going through all the right motions of being a great older boyfriend while staying sensitive enough that family-life is important to Lola and abiding by her father' rules. But gradually his shine wears off and we see his rebellious side peeking through that can only drag Lola down. When he started taking time away from her and revealed his nasty side to her friends he showed his true face.<br /><br />Lola's fathers, Nathan and Andy, were what held this book together. Being brought up by two fathers is nothing new these days and I loved that Lola was a really happy person from a loving home. This isn't something you see very often in YA books and made a nice break. Norah also proved to be exactly what we envisaged from the beginning. But Lola gave her hope, and for people who are in unfortunate circumstances, she really gave us a glimpse of her maturity.<br /><br />Overall, there are so many little stories going on within this book. All of the characters have their weaknesses and troubles and I loved how everything, through the heartache and the pain, finally came together at the end. Stephanie Perkins is now one of my favourite authors and I can't wait to read more from her.to her friends he showed his true face.<br /><br />Lola's fathers, Nathan and Andy, were what held this book together.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Game of Thrones is a fantastic collection all fans will appreciate.  I will not discuss the series itself, as I consider a Blu-ray review to be about the actual Blu-ray.  The video quality is fantastic.  I am certainly  not \\"videophile\\", although I have seen numerous \\"professional\\" reviews of this set who say it is among HBO's best, but the video quality is far superior to the \\"HD\\" of HBO.  Audio is also fantastic.<br /><br />The major selling point, and what got me to purchase this set, are the features.  First, the \\"Complete Guide to  Westeros\\" is fantastic.  The narrators were well chosen and performed fantastic (the one minor exception being Maester Luwin when Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) should have narrated, but that was the actors choice).  Mark Addy (Robert Baratheon), Harry Lloyd (Viserys Targaryen), Donald Sumpter (Maester Luwin), Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark), Richard Madden (Robb Stark), and Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) all give fantastic narration performances.  I feel the need to single out young Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark) who's performances during the narration were exceptionally well done, especially given his age. I especially Liked the varied animations of the \\"House Histories\\".  I only wish future houses were included (The Greyjoys perhaps).<br /><br />In addition, the  \\"In episode guide\\" were some of the best and most interactive features I have ever seen in a Blu-ray.  As someone who was new to GoT when it first premiered, the characters are hard to keep up with, especially in the first 5 episodes.  Having an up to date, interactive menu that will instantly tell you who is in what scene was a pure pleasure.  I wish I had had this feature when I first watched.  Even having read all 5 books to date, I learned a thing or two about characters and locations.<br /><br />I am yet to sample the other features, as it just came out today, but I am extremely excited for the \\"Anatomy of an Episode\\" on episode 6 (although I wish they did this on afew more) and the \\"Creating the Show Open\\", which I consider awesome.<br /><br />Overall, this is already a show and series I love, but I am usually not a DVD/Blu-ray purchaser.  In Particular I point to the \\"In episode guide\\" and \\"Complete Guide to Westeros\\" as features BOTH new and old ASoIaF fans will really appreciate.  The quality of the set and the discs are fantastic, and I would highly recommend.

B003UN409Q|3.0|Calling this movie \\"The Doors\\" is misleading. It would be more accurate to call it \\"Jim Morrison and Those Other Guys In the Band,\\" since that is how it's presented.<br /><br />It's always tempting to latch onto a rock legend in these rock biopics, and Oliver Stone clings like a limpet to the ghost of Jim Morrison. Acid-soaked scenery and mysticism are in every scene, but Stone seems content to wallow in the rock'n'roll debauchery rather than get into Morrison's head.<br /><br />It opens with a voiceover of Jim Morrison's poetry, as we slowly fade into a stalled recording session. Then it flips back to 1949, as Morrison's family drives through the desert. The boy catches a glimpse of several Indians by the road -- and one of them dies as the family leaves.<br /><br />Then it flips ahead to Morrison's (Val Kilmer) years at college -- he crashes a party for a pretty girl, makes arty films, acid-trips, and devotes himself to poetry. Then his pal Ray Manzarek (Kyle McLachlan) creates a rock band, with Morrison's poetry and voice as the centerpiece. Soon The Doors become a fixture in L.A. -- and then a famed band.<br /><br />But as the Doors become more famous, Morrison increasingly loses himself in the messianic-Dionysian-rocker role that has been set out for him. He weds a witch-journalist (Katherine Quinlan) but loves his fey girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). And when he outrages the authorities with the threat of public exposure, the spiral starts that will only lead to death.<br /><br />Stone certainly knew how to evoke the golden ages of rock'n'roll. Lots of sex, kinetic concerts, and bizarre behavior where Morrison jumps up on platforms and screams, \\"I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!\\" The whole movie just kind of sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />And Stone is quite brilliant with the direction. The movie is filmed like an acid trip -- shifting multicoloured skies, Indian ghosts, shadows on the sand, and eerie lighting. And it touches on other aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic. The other Doors are relegated to a frame for Morrison's bizarre behavior, and after the first half hour, they basically fade away. And he gets too enamored of his own style with the Indian ghost, and the arty \\"dead man\\" final scenes.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a shockingly good job with the languid, unpredictable energy of Morrison. He sings well too. Sadly, his performance is stuck in a one-note character -- Stone opts to potray him just as a random, sleazy, wild jerk, and we don't get a single insight into his thoughts. Sure, Morrison could be horrible. But this is Jim Morrison as rock cliche, not as a human being.<br /><br />And sadly, none of the other actors get much chance to expand on their roles -- the other Doors actors, including MacLachlan, basically play slightly annoyed accessories, and Meg Ryan plays a sweet girl without many other dimensions. Although Crispin Glover has a tiny, memorable role as Andy Warhol.<br /><br />\\"The Doors\\" opens into a beautiful psychedelic movie, but Stone fails to give it a soul.

B0055SWM08|5.0|What a wonderfully relaxing game.  A very pleasant way to waste a few minutes.  So happy I bought this.  Highly recommended!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always enjoyed this one, a good challenge for the brain. A good one to take to the doctors office to help kill time

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I have pretty good hearing and don't usually crank up the volume, but when I popped this CD in this morning and We Take Care of Our Own started, I just had to rock it loud...and it sounded GOOD. Wrecking Ball *almost* makes me forget that whole Dream thing. For me, The Rising is absolutely the best Bruce of this decade and I liked Magic a lot, but now Wrecking Ball rises to #2 for me. As always, the songs are well written and performed exquisitely. The slow ones don't hit me as hard as other slow songs have, but I like 'em too. And because I know Bruce is grieving and wanted to include Clarence, the Christianity references weren't too distracting. As more of an Earthy type, and decidedly non-xian, such references detract from the overall beauty...but Bruce gets it done nonetheless, wonderfully done.

B004P1JEXE|5.0|Regardless of what some people think and say... about this book being boring or disappointing or whatever... I found it most satisfying, well-written, and clever!<br /><br />That he chose to split his story into two books and to arrange his chapters with new POV characters for the Feast for Crows, is both daring and original, though I expected nothing less from this author whose plot development throughout the book series never stops to surprise me. Personally, I love what he's done, because the story has more suspense, while we get a better understanding of characters like Cersei, Brienne, Jaime and also Littlefinger (who was a bit obscure in the previous books, you never knew what he was up to) and of new places like Dorne and the Iron islands.<br /><br />George RR Martin is trully a master in creating fictional worlds! Historically-inspired fictional settings and situations, convincing social structures; his characters are very well developed and, in a sense, real. Through all of his books, including this one, he manages to bring his story to life for every reader.<br />Lastly, Martin has created a fantasy novel series that has relevance to the modern world, important messages to send in between the lines about power and corruption, religious fanaticism, honor and family, a world in crisis...<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next books, Dance with Dragons 1&2 and all else that is to follow them!<br /><br />If you are a fan of fantasy novels, I absolutely recommend this book series, including the Feast for Crows.

006197806X|4.0|I LOVED Delirium.  It was one of my favorite books last year.  So I couldn't wait to get my hands on Pandemonium!  And it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Lena is a such a strong character.  I don't know if I could be as strong as she is if I were in her shoes.  I liked how the story went back and forth between \\"Then\\" when Lena was in the Wilds and \\"Now\\" when is she is under cover for the resistance.  The only thing is, I can't remember how the \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" connected.  The last \\"Then\\" part I remember reading is when they are traveling for the winter and at the last homestead, they get attacked by Scavengers.  Can anyone please help me connect what happened after that???  Thanks!<br /><br />Anyways, in this story we are introduced to Julian.  I didn't want to like him.  I really didn't.  But I did.<br /><br />There are a bunch of twists and turns in this book.  Unfortunately, I saw all but one coming.  That didn't make the story any less enjoyable though.  The book is sooo easy to get into.  I get so caught up into Lena's world.  I can't wait to read the third book in the trilogy but hate that I have to wait so long!
0783240287|4.0|I was delighted to see this appear in video several years back.  I am a music teacher and I have wanted to use this in class.  Generally it serves its' purpose, but I was extremely disappointed in the racy costuming.  It is totally inappropriate for elementary age children.  I was surprised since I assumed it was aimed at children and families. You will want to pre-view this and make your own decision.
0385342063|5.0|Fun, witty, and engaging book by Sophie Kinsella.  Author makes it easy to fall in love with the main character while you also feel anxious about her lost engagement ring.  I had a few hurdles to put aside before I could enjoy the book.  First of all, she loses her engagement ring at her bridal shower and all of her girlfriends abandon her; she searches for her ring by herself.  I found that really hard to believe that at least 1 bridesmaid didn't stay behind to help her look for the ring.  Then there was the stolen cell phone incident.  She could have simply gone to the first cell phone carrier store and had a new phone programmed with her current phone number immediately.  And then she conveniently finds another cell phone in the trash..?  After I got over these unrealistic scenarios, I really enjoyed the book.  The author's witty writing keeps you laughing and sympathizing with the main character.  The book turns into a sweet love story, self-discovery journey, and mini-mystery adventure all rolled into one.  Another high-quality chick-lit book by Sophie Kinsella.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Give it a shot, its a great begining to a series and is a lot of fun to read. Suzanne Collins does a great job of world building and really setting the stage and pulling you in. I highly recommend this book.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|This album has some of the most beautiful melodies and productions I've heard in a long time from a pop artist. Her record producers made a gem of an album through full use of hip hop beats, real orchestra, and Lana's enchanting voice. Part of me wanted to dislike this album due to Lana's carefully manufactured image and career, but I will push that aside to review just the music.<br /><br />Many of the fan reviews here neglect to point out that Ms. Grant only co-writes some of the tracks. If you're an insider in the music industry, you know that this basically means that someone else did all the work (someone else = professional song writers).<br /><br />This album's studio recordings really shine in contrast to her infamously bad live performances. Even though Lana Del Rey is a cosmetic-surgery addicted puppet, at least we can take comfort knowing that she can make beautiful music with the right producers.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book! Couldn't put it down. The writing and imagery is fantastic, the story and concept amazing. A \\"must-read!\\"
B004EBT5CU|5.0|one of my happiest CD purchases: the entire CD is absolutely fantastic. i keep playing it over & over again, sometimes *trying* to sing along, but most of the time letting Adele's unique voice dominate while i just drive & enjoy!
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|alright, i didnt hear about this album until after listening to the wall, i bought this, and MY MIND WAS BLOWN!!!<br />it starts with pigs on the wing part 1, slow, but meaningful, then came dogs, a 17 minute gem that makes this album better than the wall, from the guitar solos to waters' ending, great track, then come the pigs, amazing, along with the wah piano solo, then finally sheep, the heaviest song on the track, it starts off with an organ, then bam! hits you square in the face, along with verses from the bible, then back to the slow, pigs on the wing part 2, a perfect ending<br /><br />if you havent listened to this album, GO BUY IT, AND LISTEN TO IT!!!!
B001DHXT2A|4.0|The code for the digital copy does not work.  I didn't notice the reviews that said this already until after I ordered the movie.  However, when I contacted Amazon, I was given a replacement after I sent back the ENTIRE product via USPS.  I wasn't too happy about having to go out of my way to get a new product when it is an issue with the product not because I decided I didn't want it, or something like that.  The replacement that I received STILL did not work.  But the DVD still works.  I contacted Amazon again and offered to reimburse me 25% of what I paid PLUS I would be contacted to get a new code for the digital copy to work properly. I said that I would like to have 33% back since that is how much is not working and the new code. The representative agreed and that is what I received.<br /><br />When Amazon contacted me to resolve the issue, I was told to call them back.  When I called, they weren't able to resolve the code issue.  However, they did reimbuse me the entire purchase price so I could purchase a digital copy through iTunes.<br /><br />Even though the digital copy did not work, overall I am satisfied considering I made out on the reimbursement. Only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because I had to send back the part of the product that worked.
B006M4RN3U|2.0|I gave this record 2 stars. I feel like I should explain what about the record I loved and what killed it for me. For starters, the lead singer of this group has a phenomenal voice. The pitch, the range, the inflection is all fantastic. The music is perfect. Its a wonderful blend of emo pop and that Neon Tree's/Young the Giant hipster pop that is all the rage, while being their own sound. They lyrics are fun and bright while telling a story about what goes on in this mans head. Some of my favorites songs on this record:<br /><br />Some Nights(Intro: This opening is so fantastic, you are just dying to hear the rest of this record. It really showcases the singers voice especially on that last night.<br />Some Nights: It picks right back up from where the intro left on with a bombasitc sound and amazing harmonies.<br />Carry On: Again, showcases the amazing lyrics, singing and overall sound of this band with a kickass beat.<br />Why Am I the One: Just a song I can relate to and feel like its a honerable mention<br />Out On the Town: All of the songs in the middle of this record are forgiven when you get to this last track. It is constantly on repeat for me. I cant even explain it fully, just listen and enjoy!<br /><br />So now that I got the good out of the way, on to why I only gave it 2 stars. The irony here being that I can explain its two star rating with two words: AUTO TUNE!!!!! This man has an amazing voice yet the bulk of this albums material is autotuning his voice to high hell. I was furious with listening to this record because it honestly takes away from the music being played and the singers amazing voice. It's a disapointment that instead of resting on their proven musical prowess, they turn to cheap production tricks to seem innovative and inspired. I really mean it when I say that the autotune is so distracting, I just started skipping songs to find one where he acutally uses the power of his real voice and the band playing. Thats where I got my top five list from. They are the songs where the band plays and he sings and their talent just speaks for itself.<br /><br />In conlusion, would I recommend this record? Yes I would. I would because the potential is hard to ignore and the talent is there in the songs and isn't that hard to find. What I find annoying is the overuse of the autotune and it bothers me because it's run rampant on this record but the music isn't bad. It is exactly what the band named it to be: fun. So I will recommend it to people and I will listen to the record on repeat, just not those god forsaken autotuned portions.e list from.

B004SOR4H6|4.0|Very good graphics and controls.  Must use strategy in later stages in picking armor and weapons to stay alive. The opponents get uglier and tougher as you progress through the tournament.  Stay alive!  Could get addictive.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the best book I have read in awhile (read it on my Kindle), and I have read a lot of books since getting the Kindle for Christmas.  I finished it in 3 days, I just couldn't put it down.  I cannot wait for the rest of the story!  I will check out more of this author, he is better than a lot of more \\"famous\\" authors, and young enough to keep cranking out stories for years and years!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Thought this was an excellent book. Have read some others with a similar idea such as Matthew Reilly's \\"Contest\\" but this was first with children as the protagonist's,  a truly frightening thought. Was up to 2 am to see what happened in the end and then had to immediately get the next in the series to continue the adventure. Hope that others enjoy the story as much as I did.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|Intro<br />This movie needs no introduction - the beautiful tale that is \\"Life is Beautiful\\" quickly puts it at the top of many people's top movies of all time lists. This is the fourth blu-ray that I purchased when I built my new HTPC, and I have quickly amassed a large collection, seeking after the best of the best!<br /><br />Image Quality<br />Let's get down to what you want to know. The image quality on the blu-ray is about an 8/10. Certain scenes are a little soft in their focus, but I was pleased to see that they didn't do too much de-noising on the transfer. I own this movie on DVD, and there is a clear difference in quality. The colors are better, and the overall sharpness is not overly-digital as you might find on some blu-rays!<br /><br />Sound Quality<br />Again, the sound quality is quite good, and again much better than DVD. I'm not an audiophile, but with a modest home theatre set up I was very pleased and the audio!<br /><br />Overall<br />Even if you don't care about blu-ray quality, this movie is a must have. A surprisingly clean transfer however, makes this a movie worth future-proofing!
B0071PS7AC|3.0|I read the help, played a few solo games, then I beat all the in-game players on the first try.  Just a tip, sending the ball straight down the middle doesn't work, you rarely get a strike.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|[This is kind of spoiler-ish]  I was reluctant to read this book, because I can't seem to get back into YA fiction, but, if the YA fiction of today means simple, concise, packed prose like this, that is so easily accessible, then I really need to read more of it.<br /><br />There is a great balance of exposition here, and just enough revealed, naturally or narratively.  I had an immediate connection to Katniss, which is something that usually takes a while to get into.  The story about her sister's cat was a great example of this, demonstrating both her toughness and the powerful love for her sister.  The first chapter is so powerful, it's a shame that the movie trailer gives the plot away.  The opening is also great, with the concept of bartering for tesserae.  While world-building can be stale, and not so creative, this brings out socioeconomic details, familial dynamic, and additionally, adds to the tension of the lottery.<br /><br />I don't know the terminology for this, but I enjoyed her use of experiential metaphor(?).  Using past experiences or thoughts as metaphor, instead of some sort of awkward correlation, helps us relate to the characters without being distracted by writing style.  Also, the use of memory along with the introduction of Peeta gives us perspective on how Katniss has gotten to where she is, and shows us her humanity.  If Katniss would have been the only person we would have gotten to know, we could have still really enjoyed the book, but only remained an observer.  But, when Peeta's true nature is revealed to Katniss on the train, our hearts quicken when we learn about the rules of the Hunger Games.  No child should have to grow up so soon.<br /><br />I also loved Haymitch's strategy.  It introduced a sort of device found in screwball comedies.  She is supposed to pretend to like someone she shouldn't like, and she is actually starting to like, but will never show she truly likes, except when she has to show she is pretending to.  Seems complicated, but adds so much the complexity of the relationships.<br /><br />I recalled stories of WWI, where, during Christmas time, everyone laid down arms, and celebrated the holiday, and, the next day, went back to trying to kill each other.  I was also reminded of how I was, at her age, feeling so strongly about something, and being in denial of what was really going on.  The passion of that age, that, in some respects, never comes again.<br />P.S.  I am such a sap and a sucker, and couldn't believe how emotional I was getting. I was emotionally manipulated as exactly as intended.  [shakes fist at Collins].  And, I am a HUGE fan of Jennifer Lawrence since I saw her in WINTER'S BONE, that I can't wait to see her in this movie.  So glad I read the book first, and you should do the same.
0307948560|1.0|I really hate to write this type of review because I understand that many people hold the struggles in this book so closely; however, \\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" has to be the worst 'chick lit' novel I have ever read.<br /><br />The characters are not sufficiently complex and the 'plot' really doesn't get going until chapter 35 when Kate tries to finally fight back to the establishment she just spent 30 chapters discussing.  These first 30 chapters are pretty much descriptions of what the main character is doing and there is no centralized goal she is working towards.  Her feelings are accurately and beautifully described; however, I just like to look forward to something happening to address a central plot line.<br /><br />Her decision in the end (I won't spoil it) and moreover, how that decision is portrayed will not jive well with any hard working woman.  It just seemed like an easy way out of the central problems the target audience is looking for: How can I have it all: Work, Family, Love, Fulfillment, etc.?
B0045DO8II|5.0|Here's what a \\"respected\\" rock critic said on a \\"respected\\" music reference site about the Outlaws's \\"Bring 'Em (It?) Back Alive\\" Album (I'll paraphrase to avoid copyright problems):<br /><br />\\"Of all...successful Southern Rock bands, The Outlaws...least distinctive sound....fine guitar work and nice jams on this live album....otherwise The Outlaws do not have much to offer....material is run of the mill....vocals are unexceptional. Includes There Goes Another Love Song and the Freebird wannabe Green Grass and High Tides....an okay live album by an okay band\\"<br /><br />Isn't that a crock of BS! While somewhat guilty of not crafting more easilly-accessible songs (i.e., more suited to top-40 or AOR/Classic Rock radio) more like Skynyrd, Marshall Tucker, Charlie Daniels, Molly Hatchet, and even the Awesome, er, Allman Bros., etc., (all GREAT bands, BTW), their blend of Southern Rock, Boogie, Blues, Country, Pop and even a little Jazz was/is most certainly unique and immediately identifiable as the Florida Guitar Army! While dedicating \\"Green Grass...\\" to the recently departed (at the time) members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, it most cettainly is NOT a \\"Freebird\\" wannabe. Most R&R bands of the immediately preceding and following eras had their own \\"Freebird\\", i.e., their tour-de-force and/or most easily identifiable song(s)...so what? That's Rock 'n Roll!<br /><br />All I can tell you is, I would have worn-out my vinyl copy of this many times over had I not been anal about my records and immediately dubbed them to cassette upon the first playing! I actually had to, much to my chagrin, try several times to record this album to tape because it was too long to fit on a std. 90min cassette, including speeding up the pitch of the turntable to save time, LOL!! I understand that the original single-disc CD version of this recording had the same problem: there were omissions due to editing. No such problem on this version! Here it is presented in all it's \\"unedited\\" glory: a great tribute to a great live band....one that met or exceeded their studio versions live....like all great bands of the \\"classic\\" rock era!<br /><br />As a bonus, I probably paid less for this CD than I did for my original vinyl copy (which I still have) and I don't have to worry abouut tape stretch, natural degaussing, stylus and groove wear or that bloody dusty Discwasher ever again, LOL!<br /><br />BTW, I've seen all the bands I've listed above live on multiple occasions over the years and I'd stack The Outlaws \\"classic\\" line-up represented on this disc  (yes I know, Henry Paul was the original third guitarist/vocalist, not Freddie Salem, amongst other personnel changes over the years) against any of those other great, great bands! They certainly deserve their rightful place in the Pantheon of Southern Rock Gods, and this record proves it IMHO.<br /><br />RIP, Hughie, Billy (and Frank).

B006UG90RM|1.0|The album is, unfortunately, a big disappointment. Some of my favourite albums are Van Halen CDs, so I was very keen to listen to this one. I put the headphones on, laid back and listened to the entire album. I hate to say it (and I hate to leave a negative review of anything), but this album was very, very disappointing. The songs are...boring. No hooks, no catchy choruses, no catchy guitar riffs. It sounds like a collection of uninspired B-sides. After listening to the CD I could not remember anything about it. \\"Immemorable\\" would be the mot juste.<br /><br />It was, however, nice to hear David Lee Roth's voice. His voice is still as strong as ever. It's just a pity that there were no catchy melodies for him to sing.<br /><br />The production is a bit odd in places, too, with audible artifacts (string scratches) left in and some editing on vocal lines that is uncomfortably chopped together and too tight. Also, the doubling up effect on the vocals with a deep vocal panned left and right gets old after a while.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but save your money, folks.
B0002HWJY6|4.0|This smurf house is very cute, and I like its small size (big toys take up too much room!). It's also brightly colored, detailed, and seems very durable. It fits the smurf set from the movie perfectly. My 2.5 year old was very excited to get it and to open and close the door. My two complaints are that the roof does not stay on (my son is constantly bugging me to \\"fix it\\"), and that the door height is slightly too short for the smurfs to walk into (my son said, \\"they're too big!\\").

1451673442|5.0|While I enjoy The Secret and The Power, in this new book Rhonda Byrne finally gives us some practical step-by-step exercises we can use to incorporate the law of attraction into our lives. Each of the 28 daily exercises focuses on gratitude and recognition of the abundance you already have in order to ensure that the abundance continues and grows. This concept is easy to get but hard to master which is why I am so excited about following the steps she suggested. You can do each exercise on its own or follow the schedule she lays out in the book. Well worth the money and your time. Thanks Rhonda!!!
B00005JO5L|2.0|While I disagree with the Turkey (1-star) rating given by [[ASIN:0345449916 Mick Martin]]--at nine words, it was also one of the shortest reviews in the guide: \\"A horror in the real sense of the word.\\"--William Friedkin's 1980 film is very far from perfect.<br /><br />I have seen Cruising three times, each viewing separated by several months. The film is disturbing every time. It's not just the unbelievable level of risk (and nonexistent backup) that the undercover assignment affords. It's also the unease with which Friedkin retells the [[ASIN:0812813235 story]]. This seems to be a case of not knowing how offensive to be. Protesters from New York City's gay community besieged the on-location production, and Friedkin admits during the commentary track that post-production looping was necessary due to the noise. Richard Gere ([[ASIN:B00005AQMJ And the Band Played On]]) was said to have been Friedkin's first choice for the lead, and maybe the first instinct was right. Al Pacino (looking eerily like a young John Turturro) seems willing to get his hands dirty--some of the club scenes, which may or may not include stolen footage, evidence fisting--but he remains hamstrung by the script. Ultimately, the filmmakers got it wrong: the film is too disturbing for the general public and yet not disturbing enough for enthusiasts of the genre.<br /><br />More objectively, the film is simply not shot well. Or maybe the editing is to blame. A late scene of Pacino stalking his suspect goes dark except for a spotlight around Pacino. Apparently this is a \\"Director's Cut\\" tweak to make the scene's intent more clear. The same suspect's father, seen in flashback sequences, is a confusing and unsatisfying red herring. Moreover, the director's decision to interchange actors as the killer in an attempt to deliberately confuse the whodunit seems misguided. Cruising's ambiguity leaves this viewer unclear whether that was the goal or whether Friedkin simply could not decide what story to tell (or how to tell it). Too, the film suffers from an inability to connect emotionally with its hero.<br /><br />The Village Voice's Nathan Lee opined recently that Cruising is \\"a lurid fever dream of popper fumes, color-coded pocket hankies, hardcore disco frottage, and Crisco-coated forearms.\\" Certainly it remains a time capsule despite its many faults. Clubs like the Ramrod are long since gone and sadly so must be many of the men who played extras here. Unfortunately, this exploitative film does nothing to dispel the posited association between homosexuality and antisocial behavior. Witness Friedkin's decision to intersplice frames of hardcore gay pornography into some of the murder scenes.<br /><br />Somewhat infamously, the film and its director were nominated for the first ever RAZZIE Awards. Poor commentary track here in the Deluxe Edition: Director Friedkin alternates between simply describing the action and dead air. It is much less informative and engaging than his insight on [[ASIN:B0006GANN2 The French Connection]]. Better is the long interview with Friedkin from the September 2007 issue of Venice Magazine.

1426308469|5.0|My son loves this book, we got it for him for Christmas. He can't read and it's very \\"texty\\" but he still loves to look at all the pictures of the dinosaurs.<br /><br />This book has him asking so many questions about all the different dinosaurs that I've started to teach him to sound out words so he can tell himself whatever it is that he wants to know, ie: what/where/who/when/how this dinosaur lived/ate/etc! He is so interested in dinosaurs and this book, that he forgets he's learning to read, so it seems like a game and it comes more naturally for him!<br /><br />Also, ths book is extremely informative. It's not only \\"cool\\" for my son to look at, the facts about the dinosaurs are interesting, complete, accurate, consistent from dinosaur to dinosaur (each dinosaur has the same info, so when your child wants to know \\"what does this one eat!!!??\\" to every single dinosaur in the entire book, you can answer him or her instead of responding \\"Uhhh, it doesn't say...\\" like some other books) and informative.<br /><br />Thanks National Geographic!!
B00664AM5C|3.0|The film \\"Contagion\\" plays on our media-fed fears of what might transpire during a global pandemic. The film traces the development of a mutant flu, its transmission, the response from the scientific and medical community, and possible societal consequences.<br /><br />The notion of zoonotic transmission of mutant flu strain lingers lack a nagging nightmare, and global interconnectedness and rapid transit via jets (think of them as disease incubators) across sets up the perfect storm. Couple that with the almost nonexistent screening for disease at airports, docks, and border crossings, and it is clear that an infectious disease outbreak in one part of the world can rapidly spread pretty much anywhere. \\"Contagion\\" taps into that fear and as the film shows in some of its strongest and well-crafted sections, in just a matter of days and weeks, a global pandemic could occur.<br /><br />Its initial depiction of the public health response to such an event seem realistic as epidemiologists plot the rate and route of transmission and infection, field staff try to cope with organizing a response as the health system is soon overwhelmed, and researchers beak out their microscopes and centrifuges.<br /><br />But this section is also the weakest part of the film. Public health researchers would actually be swarming the labs and facilities, not working in lonely pairs. The CDC director would not be calling his from a dark, empty room like the film's staged setting. The amount of activity would make a beehive in midsummer seem relaxed, and the film flubs this portrayal.<br /><br />The social and economic fabric would likely ravel to some degree, possibly as shown in the film. Desperate people would hoard food and drugs, other desperate people would loot, kill, and kidnap, and the healthy would in large measure shun the sick. Misinformation would proliferate via the Internet (e.g., the forsythia cure), and schools and workplaces would shut down. (Did anyone else keep waiting for the power to go off and wonder what Matt Damon and his daughter were finding to eat?)<br /><br />In real life, military-enforced quarantines and curfews might help curtail this breakdown---or perhaps fuel it---in some areas.<br /><br />I understand that movies cannot operate at the same pace as real-life, so the lack of temporal realism did not bother me that much---unlike the often pounding, jarring soundtrack that required keeping my remote available at all times.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" falls squarely in the middle of the pack, interesting enough, packed full of potential, but never quite good enough to trigger my \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\"the power to go off and wonder what Matt Damon and his daughter were finding to eat?)<br /><br />In real life, military-enforced quarantines and curfews might help curtail this breakdown---or perhaps fuel it---in some areas.<br /><br />I understand that movies cannot operate at the same pace as real-life, so the lack of temporal realism did not bother me that much---unlike the often pounding, jarring soundtrack that required keeping my remote available at all times.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" falls squarely in the middle of the pack, interesting enough, packed full of potential, but never quite good enough to trigger my \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\"

B0012GMW34|5.0|If you're a fan of John McLaughlin's music in general and especially of his jazz-fusion Mahavishnu Orchestra period from the 1970s, then you're going to love this album. If you're a Santana fan and don't know Carlos's music from this period so well, then this might be more of a surprise.<br /><br />The differing styles of these two great guitarists meld surprisingly well, as they knew each other and played together a lot. LDS is 100% instrumental (there's a background repetitive choral chant on one track, but this is not really a `song'). It's in the same vein as some of the lengthier and more complex pieces released on Santana's 1973 `Welcome' - on which McLaughlin guested - and `Borboletta' albums, and is particularly redolent of the sound on MO's `Lost Trident Sessions.'<br /><br />Both these musicians were during this period seeking after a higher spiritual meaning in life and devoted to the works of Sri Chinmoy (Santana later described Chinmoy as \\"vindictive\\" but said his association with the Indian had been a \\"good learning experience\\"). A spiritual intensity informs the music and it can't be described as `easy listening', but for those who appreciate the very best jazz-fusion played at a high level with virtuosity and passion, this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />Fellow members of the contemporary Santana band Michael Shrieve, Doug Rauch and Armando Peraza, and McLaughlin's fellow MO jazzmen drummer Billy Cobham and pianist Jan Hammer - described as playing `drums' in the sleeve notes - form fine backing combos on the various tracks and make the album a kind of summit-meeting for the jazz fusion innovators of the early 1970s.<br /><br />The original album came in at less than 30 minutes, but with no padding and every track a gem. The standout piece for most fans is the superlative `Let us go into the House of the Lord' with a captivating intensity which will likely leave you breathless. On this release, alternate takes of Trane's `A Love Supreme' with its insistent driving bass motif an anchor to the soaring guitar virtuosity, and `Naima' with its acoustic `Lotus-on-Irish-Streams' feel are offered as bonus tracks.nsistent driving bass motif an anchor to the soaring guitar virtuosity, and `Naima' with its acoustic `Lotus-on-Irish-Streams' feel are offered as bonus tracks.

140120841X|5.0|This has become one of my favorite graphic novels quickly. The characterization is excellent, the story is one that quickly draws the reader in, and the art is pretty good. There may be parts of the story that may seem worthless (and/or confusing) but the pieces fall into place. V is not the only character who gets characterization for many others get some excellent details in their character. If you keep an open mind it'll be very rewarding. Once you start reading this you'll have a new meaning for the letter V.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Some people are confused about this CD...It is a Bruce CD...every Bruce CD is different and Wrecking Ball is no exception...Just because critics are giving this record rave reviews DOES NOT mean they think it is his best ever...Nothing could EVER hold a torch to Born To Run or Born In The USA...or even The River...BUT...It is his best since that era.  Every song is different and heartfelt. We Take Care Of Our Own goes without saying...Other favorite tracks include Wrecking Ball and Land of Hopes and Dreams...We Are Alive may be the most different and coolest thing he ever recorded.  I loved the Rising and Magic...but I love this one just a little bit more.

B0010QEPLI|5.0|\\"Tri-State\\" by Above and Beyond contains a balanced mix of lush melodies that harmoniously combine music from the electronica and trance genres.  These songs are great for relaxation and include themes of strong emotion.

0553801473|2.0|In the afterword of Book 4, the author mentions producing lots of pages for us; indeed so many he decided to cover half the characters in one book the other in a second half (A Dance with Dragons) and cut the effort in half.  George, unfortunately it really does feels like this is what you are doing...creating pages, but in the process loosing the spirit and vitality of your story, and us your readers.  It feels like there are books to be sold versus a story to tell.  This is sad.  I hope you can get back to where you started in the first three books and finish with something your readers would enjoy remembering; rather than minucia with little or no purpose than filler.

B0071PS7AC|3.0|But ultimately fails to deliver. I like that I can't alter the trajectory of the ball by tilting my phone after it's been released.  However, the ball and pin action needs some pretty serious work. Once I got the hang of it, most of my rolls were pocket hits, but I've never seen pocket hits result in so many odd splits. The same applies for spare attempts -- for instances where the ball location should have converted spares, pins would be left standing.<br /><br />It was worthwhile to play around with the game for awhile, but it'll be uninstalled today. I'll give it a try at a later date to see if the action is improved.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm new to the watch world. Many reviewers (not just on this product) are watch connoisseurs and collectors; I am not. After years of not wearing a watch and instead just using my phone to tell time, I thought it would be a nice accessory to bring back. Much quicker and nicer for a quick wrist shot than digging my phone out, especially during a photo shoot.<br /><br />This watch feels really nice and sturdy. Metal case, thick and durable fabric band, metal clasp. I feel as though it tells time accurately, maybe only getting off my about 30 seconds over the past 3 months.<br /><br />I love the simplicity of the design. I was looking specifically for a military-esque design. I was between this and a MUCH more expensive Victorinox and I decided to go with this simply because of cost. I'm happy with my choice. The face is simple yet has nice detail and the numbers and hands glow in the dark.<br /><br />The only \\"issue\\" I've had is the end of the strap occasionally gathering some fuzz from a sweatshirt or flannel shirt. I don't really want to blame that on the watch, except to say it makes me feel like, because it's a fabric strap, it may eventually fray a bit on the end, but that's certainly yet to be seen.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with this Seiko and have no reason to give it any less than a 5/5.
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of the best mobile games I have played! Very easy to negotiate around program and move cards. Addictive, though not such that is a good thing! Thanks.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Good game.  Interface is easy, graphics are fun.  The app works well on my Kindle Fire.  BUT, it's a game that you can't do much with at one time.  You pretty much just have to keep checking in on it.  It's hard for me to see these types of games as &quot;games&quot;, but for some unknown reason they become very addictive.<br /><br />If you like all the Facebook games, you'll love this one and the others in the series.<br /><br />They should maybe change the titles, though, since there is no &quot;story&quot;.

0307891372|5.0|Everything (good) that everyone here said about this book is 100% true in my opinion.I got the book from amazon in perfect condition in WAY less time<br />than anticipated (since I got standard shipping and it took only 2 days to get here!)<br />The guidebook is BIG.Very impressive and FULL of important information about everything Skyrim.I mean , the VERY first day I got it (just less than an hour ago) I used it.I contracted vampirism in the game and instead of stopping the game to go to say TES:Skyrim Wikia , I paused the game and quickly learned to travel to Morthal ,meet Falion ,acquire a Black Soul Gem and have Falion perform a Ritual to rid me of the disease! Right to the point and I moved along to whatever I was doing at the time.<br />The quality of the book itself is VERY nice.Thick quality pages with very nice (although a bit small) font and illustrations.Plus you get a nice map to go with it although I dread ripping it out of the book.<br />If I had more money I would've went for the hardcover edition but this is extremely well done and I don't really regret not ordering hardcover that much.<br />Highly recommended to anyone who wants to get as much out of Skyrim as possible and also to the fans of this awesome and beautiful gem of a game.<br /><br />PS I'll buy the hardcover edition eventually -  but never use it :)

0399226907|5.0|My children love this story! This book explains the life cycle of the butterfly and introduces children to the days of the week, the names of fruits, and numbers as the caterpillar eats through different foods each day --two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, etc.-- until he finally weaves his cocoon and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.We enjoy reading his books again and again and the story was easy to remember. Beautiful illustrations and great story. Yet there are some mistakes like on the \\"Saturday\\" page according to the text, the caterpillar ate through \\"one slice of salami\\", yet the picture shows that he eats through the entire salami, the butterfly he turns into has its wings upside-down and the butterflies comes from chrysalis not cocoons.The reason I rated this book a 5 stars is because this is a beautiful,educational,imaginative and fun book for little kids. I highly recommend this book for younger children.

Some are beaten, starved, forced, born into submission to the demands of those who profit from and enjoy degradation. Salo is what resides behind the symbols we give our power to.

B0034G4P4O|3.0|This movie is weird!<br />Well for adults anyway.<br /> Now I freely admit I haven't read a lot of Tintin, but I always imagined him to be a boy,....oh say about 16/17 maybe.<br />The character as presented here is some sort of strange hybrid man/boy. He looks like a boy, (well sort of!), but has all the strength and abilities of a man,lives alone, carries and use guns frequently and is more than capable of knocking full grown huge thugs out with his fists.<br />It's sanitised of course, ......he shoots a lot but the direction is contrived so that you never see him actually hit anyone, ...much less kill them.<br /><br />It was conflicting messages for me, but then as I mentioned above, I'm a bit of a newcomer to Tin-tin.<br />Positives first: It's BEAUTIFULLY drawn in most cases. Clever, ...even witty illustration in parts, specially during the wipes; and the textures and effects are visually very captivating. The water, the fire, etc. are exceptional.<br />I do have issues with the motion capture process used, which at times had some characters looking like a human actor's body just wearing a huge caricature mask over their head. This was most obvious on the Captain character.<br /><br />Now I am one who can usually quite willingly park my brain in the foyer and suspend disbelief for the duration of a movie that creates a fantasy.<br />That being said, I enjoyed the beginning of this movie where it sort of stuck almost within the bounds of possibility, ...or even went just beyond.<br />However as it progressed, the action really \\"jumps the shark\\"! Shark? More like leaps the leviathan!<br /><br />Yes I know it's a cartoon but the extreme and constant OTT exaggerated and impossible action scenes just left me saying \\"Yeah right, ...like THAT'S ever gonna happen\\" after a while.<br />And it's kept at that frenetic level for most of the second half.<br />Spielburg has never been one for restraint or subtlety in any of his movies, and let's just say he doesn't go against character in this one. There's certainly no build up to an exciting action bit, then releasing of tension so that it can be built up again sort of thing. It's just full-throttle all the time. All of which has the effect of over-kill for me<br />I would have appreciated just a little more of a nod to the original Herg&eacute; material by way of keeping it more \\"boys-own-adventure\\", rather than the Indiana Jones on hyper-steroids approach.<br />I certainly enjoyed it for the animation, ....apart from the bodies with big carnival heads I've already mentioned.<br /><br />I still think Spielberg has \\"aged\\" Tintin too much, creating a conflict in the audience's mind between his appearance and what we see him do.

1401937519|5.0|There would be absolutely nothing like having a `death' experience to glean complete clarity and insight into, well, everything.  The journey that led Anita Moorjani to this death experience was wrought with struggle.  The expectations set by her family and her culture created a certain anxiety and fear, which stuck with her as she grew.  Although her parents pushed her to follow their own Indian path, Anita struggled to fit into that mold, which only fed her increasing anxiety.  She found herself fearful of most everything, but perseverated and lost sleep over her fear of failure, of not being lovable, and of disappointing the people around her.  In the years that led to adulthood, she found her true love, lost her father, and struggled to maintain her own ideals amidst the cultural pressures to conform.<br />In 2001, her best friend and her brother-in-law were both diagnosed with cancer.  The fear that ensued was overwhelming for Anita, as she incessantly read about the disease, its potential causes, prognoses, and treatments.  These obsessive thoughts led her to fear life itself.  Then, her worst nightmare came true on April 26, 2002, when her doctor called to deliver the news about the lump she had found on her right shoulder.  It turned out to be lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system.  The next four years were filled with alternative treatments, research, stress, and a search for salvation.  Despite her intense efforts, which included traveling through India and China, meditation, yoga, chakra balancing, meeting monks, enlightened masters and yogis, Chinese herbal medicine, and pranic healing, she continued to deteriorate.  Her body stopped absorbing nutrients, she was confined to a wheel chair,  and she couldn't breathe without a portable oxygen tank.  The day, then, arrived when her body gave up and she surrendered to the disease.  Her organs shut down and her body entered a coma.  The doctors believed that she was going to die.  Her family was notifiedand hope was lost.Meanwhile, Anita discovered herself in a realm of heightened awareness and, to this day, cannot find words in our language to describe her experience.  Sitting down to type this review, I'm at a loss for words as well, as I cannot adequately recreate the feeling of awe I experienced as I read her words.  Some of the adjectives she used to describe this experience, though, include words like indescribable, magnificent, amazing, liberating, peaceful, beautiful, healing, and enlightening.  The awareness of her purpose and her true essence came flooding through her entire being as she was filled with a feeling of complete and utter unconditional love.  In her experience, she was able to communicate with her father, receive messages from her best friend, have an awareness of conversations and discussions between doctors and family in varying locations of the hospital, as well as view her own body lying on the hospital bed.  Upon her realization that she still had purpose to fulfill in this human experience, she made a choice to come back.  \\"Now that you know the truth of who you really are, go back and live your life fearlessly!\\" was the message sent to her by her father and her best friend.<br />Anita came back to this life with a knowing about who she is, what her life experience encompasses, and an assurance that, without fear, her body would heal itself.  Defying all odds and completely flabbergasting doctors and specialists, she used the knowledge of her own magnificence and connection with the Universal energy to completely cure herself of cancer.  Cancer gone within weeks.  Really?  Yes, hospital records, scans, and tests all concur.  Cancer. gone. within. weeks.  She continued to gain strength in the weeks that followed, got her body back, and was able to live a `normal' life.  The word `normal' is all relative, of course, for her life had been forever changed.<br />\\"This (experience) has a big impact on my health as well.  Since I now see myself as an infinite being, the physical takes care of itself because it's only a reflection of what's going on within my soul.  Unconditional self-love increases my energy tremendously, and the universe acts in kind.  The external world mirrors what we feel about ourselves.  By letting go of any negative self-judgment, we allow our world to transform; and as it does so, we'll be able to feel greater and greater trust... we're one with the universe and our purpose is to be our magnificent selves.\\"  -Anita Moorjani<br />See the whole book review and a whole lot more on finding your soul's purpose... http:kirstentulsian.com
B0060Q962Q|2.0|The game does what it says. its just boring &amp; very predictable. If you're looking for a mind numbing, non-thinking, game then this is the game for you. It might be great for a 10 year old as it teaches logic,but other than that don't waste your time. Nice try tho.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is really fun.It so cool and I love the hippi blade.Its so cool my highscore is 426 peace out
B0058VW36U|5.0|I so love this game!!! om nome is so cute! I hope there will be some new levels soon, however.
B0067LXQAW|5.0|I was nervous buying this album because \\"Bury the Hatchet\\" wasn't good and \\"Wake Up and Smell the Coffee\\" left something to be desired. \\"Tomorrow\\", the first single from the album, restored my faith in The Cranberries and I bought this album. I am extremely pleased that I did.<br /><br />The album opens up with \\"Conduct\\" which reminds me of the old Cranberries with a modern twist that makes me want to watch a good ole nineties movies. Once you get past the second track, \\"Tomorrow\\", the album keeps more on the mellow side, much like their first album. They've gone away from the more rock like sound they tried to push in their last three albums which clearly didn't work well.<br /><br />I don't expect this album to fly off the shelves because The Cranberries were kind of forgotten but I really think this album can throw them back into their hay day in the 90's which I would love to see.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Tried to get it since it was the free app of the day, but I haven't played it yet because my kindle fire won't install it. Is anyone else having this problem??

B0059XTUB8|4.0|\\"Accept Marilyn on her own terms and you'll be OK, try to change her and she will drive you crazy. Trust me.\\" During the filming of \\"The Prince & The Showgirl\\" starring Marilyn Monroe (Williams) and Laurence Olivier (Branagh) tension toward Monroe began to threaten the filming of the movie. She would show up late and not know her lines. Olivier was at his breaking point when a young and ambitious assistant named Colin Clark stepped in and began to help Marilyn. I have to say that I have a love of classic movies and have seen and loved many Monroe movies. I have never seen \\"Prince & The Showgirl\\" but after watching this I really want to. This movie is not what I expected and is more of a love story then about the making of the movie. That said I still very much enjoyed this and the job that Michelle Williams does is absolutely amazing and you have to remind yourself that it is her and not the actual Monroe. Much like Joaquin Phoenix in \\"Walk The Line\\" she transforms herself so much that it makes the movie easier to get lost in. Besides the acting job by her, the movie is very good and is very much worth watching if you are a fan of bio-pics. Overall, not what I expected but I still very much enjoyed this very much. I give it a B+.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is lots of fun for myself and my kiddos (4,6 and 9).  It can be addictive.  I wish I knew why the birds are so angry at the pigs.. did the pigs steal thier eggs? LOL  GREAT GAME, ESPECIALLY FOR FREE!!!

B005ETA5K2|5.0|Many have reported a lack of functionality of this product in backtrack 5.  While this experience is somewhat consistent, it is not the nail in the coffin for this device.

B004SIP7AS|5.0|The movie follows the novel closely, avoiding the temptation of mediocre script-writers to improve on the original. The casting is good, the story will always be touching. I enjoyed it.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the power contained in this little device. It's an amplifier but it doesn't only make things sound louder, it improves volume range without distorting sound quality. Not bad for the money! My only problem is that the battery cannot be replaced. It can be recharged many times (hundreds of times according to the manual) but once the battery can no longer hold a charge, it'll be time to get another one.
B0071QIN00|3.0|It's a relatively good game, but as levels progress, there's no clear way to get past certain obstacles, and the checkpoints don't always make sense from a progress perspective (i.e. too many challenges between checkpoints that aren't always 100% likely to be cleared). Limited online walkthroughs limit the level for players who can't figure out some routes, and sometimes checkpoints are glitched, flinging players out in a way that immediately results in the end.
B006LS7DQE|3.0|I've played it on platform and loved it. All the mini-games and extra spells are on the Fire, too, but the game staggers too much between moves, and between battles. I don't know if that's a coding problem, or a processor issue with the Fire itself, but I'm going to bet the former. For five bucks, though, I expected a smooth, flawless transition, and I wish I had gotten that.
B0067H9W72|4.0|Season 2 is much better than 1. The story line is good. Season 1 was the same thing after the first 2 to 3 episodes.
B003Y5H57E|4.0|It appears that Ryan Gosling is going to take over the world - or at least your living room - because the guy is 'everywhere'. And like Bradley Cooper about six months ago - everyone wants Ryan. And I mean everyone. And on the strength of \\"Drive\\", \\"The Ides Of March\\" and this - it's easy to see why. Women are drooling over him - and guys want to be his drinking buddy.<br /><br />Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling play Cal Weaver and Jacob Palmer - two polar-opposites in the cool stakes. Cal has only ever had one woman and wife - the beautiful but slightly wayward Emily (Julianne Moore). Jacob has had more women in an hour that politicians have had billable brunches. His prey is sophisticated but loose business types that frequent the bar Jacob hangs out in - women with the corporate finesse of a piranha that hasn't eaten in a week. When Cal stumbles into an ill-advised divorce because of one mistake on the part of Emily - he enters Jacob's world - and with advice that appeals to a man's ego - enters into way too many easy lays. His journey back to his true love makes up the rest of the movie...<br /><br />Clearly relishing the witty and smartly written script  - the two wildly different male leads spar off each other very convincingly. Julianne Moore is her usual classy self as always (such a great actress). There's even a tremendously clever and funny pairing of young love in the 13-year old Robbie (Cal's son) who is besotted with his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (great work by both Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton). On the bumbling adult front - Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei bump up the cringe and laugh count too.<br /><br />But for me it's the fabulous Emma Stone who brings the whole macho proceedings to life - and like her breakthrough performance in \\"Easy A\\" - she injects some badly needed reality into the picture. Her character's bubbly nature is infectious and her palatable vulnerability fills her love scenes with Gosling with a sense of danger and thrill. Stone's Hannah wants her heart fulfilled - not used - not shattered by some smarmy barfly out to chalk up another notch on the headboard of his waterbed. Stone's Hannah is nervous, giddy, talkative, loving, trusting - she gives Hannah a 'this-is-how-a-real-woman-is' set of reactions - and the movie is so much the better for it - warm even.<br /><br />\\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\" is not pretending to be \\"War And Peace\\" - but it's a hugely enjoyable romp when those sort of things seem to be in short supply these days. Besides - it passed the ultimate litmus test - my missus and teenage daughter gobbled up every moment of it and could not be tempted away - even by morsels of Cadbury's Twirl...<br /><br />Do my girls want to discover the true meaning of love? Find out the joys of marital bliss? Bath in the wisdom of enlightened relationships? Do they bo**ox! They want to lick strawberry Haagen Daz off the Gozzer's rippling abs and YouTube the experience afterwards to make all their friends jealous. It's enough to make me go back to the gym (well now - let's not be too hasty my dears...).<br /><br />In fact - now that I think of it - forget the review. Can somebody please slip some soluble ugly tablets into Ryan Gosling's Spritzer...and do all of us mere mortals a favour!<br /><br />PS: my 18-year old daughter watched \\"The Notebook\\" for the 40th time immediately after...Hannah wants her heart fulfilled - not used - not shattered by some smarmy barfly out to chalk up another notch on the headboard of his waterbed.

B002BWP49C|3.0|Not bad. It's great to see improvement along the series of films. Everyone got a little better; they even remembered to thaw out the frozen fish stick that plays the female lead for this film. I'm pretty sure she smiled once for this movie. The films might have outgrown their original low budget director and the mistakes that go along with that since the first film but the screenwriter stayed the same, I guess that's why the films never quite got past the after-school drama/soap opera feel. No need to mention contrived love triangles and shallow story, that's what this is all about. Honestly, this is a great improvement from past films in the series, and it's nice to see almost everyone on screen coming into their own. It no longer has the cardboard cutout feel where you wonder if some of the cast were picked freshly from the mall and stuck behind a movie camera.<br />  The soundtrack I'd rate lower than the movie, and I don't think it's worth buying. I can only assume it's aiming for the all grown up feel, but it ends up feeling just plain middle aged, and makes you think maybe you're too young to be watching this movie instead of too old. Nothing memorable about the songs for me; it's the kind of music you have to try to shout over in a restaurant during dinner. Wonder what happened to Desplat, or that nice young fellow with the husky singing voice from the first movie? Won't even bother with the lyrics during the wedding scene, maybe \\"warm poison rat\\" would be a good description for Kristen, except that she lacks warmth. Yes I know you picked the song for the first movie, but still. At least thumbs up for the continuity.<br />  I'll complain about the usual things that get lost in translation from book to movie. The depth and connection you feel with the supporting cast gets supplanted in favor of extraneous fight scenes which the screenwriter added that the book didn't have, as well as lovely scene focusing on, get this, getting off a plan, being in a car, getting out of a car and walking through a very unnatural staged party on a street. Then a boat. Or wait, was that getting on a plane? Doesn't matter. Does it? So long and thanks for all the ambiance.<br />I do look forward to the next installment but I'm really just a glutton for punishment. It would be neat to see the remake in 30 years, I just wish they could retain some of the cast and remake it now.

0399159029|5.0|Bernie Gunther is a Nazi hating Berlin detective with a stellar reputation for excellence in solving crimes. Although this is a work of fiction, it involves actual historical facts as well as Nazi leaders. \\"Prague Fatale\\" takes place after the Nazis seized Czechoslovakia & Bohemia. Heydrich, the commander of the area, appointed by Hitler, sets up a lavish life-style in the seized Prague area chateau of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who was a wealthy Jewish industrialist, his wife, Adele Bloch-Bauer, is the subject of the famous 1912 painting by Gustav Klimt.  The Bloch-Bauer's chief butler is retained by Heydrich to run the chateau. Gunther is in the midst of solving a murder of a Dutch worker made to appear as an accident on the rails in Berlin when he meets a woman under mysterious circumstances who may or may not be an escort. They form an amorous relationship. Heydrich, who knows Gunther is not a Nazi although he had been sent to the Eastern front to participate in atrocities, summons Gunther to the chateau along with a cadre of high-ranking Nazi officials for a weekend gathering. The guests are plied with food and drink; Heydrich explains that it is Gunther's job to protect him. During the weekend, a young officer is discovered dead in his room, locked from the inside. Heydrich gives Gunther carte blanche to interview everyone in the Chateau, from staff to Heydrich himself. Phillip Kerr's story unravels and references are made to Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's legendary fictional detective.<br /><br />This is an absorbing and interesting work set within the Nazi milieu. I highly recommend this to those who enjoy historically accurate settings for works of fiction. At the conclusion of the novel, Kerr's \\"author's Notes\\" provides information concerning the fates of all the real-life participants and the fate of the doomed Check resistance leaders.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Works fine on the Dinc.<br />good graphics, physics and sound.  passes the time well.  not worth purchasing, but a good free app.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors.  All of the locations mentioned are based around my home town in Southern California so it has an extra appeal for me. Some of the events are also events I remember as a kid.  I love the Harry Bosch series because it takes me back to my old stomping grounds.
B001JEPVDM|5.0|Dallaire was there as a military officer; not a historian, reporter, or analyst.  He writes what he saw and he saw plenty.  Anyone who wants to know, understand, and work to prevent such atrocities should read this book.
B004SKJTY6|4.0|I originally rented dvd from Netflex but wanted to see it again and stream for my friends.  Used the Amazon's Instant Video to stream.  Nice to have movie available for a couple of days before it is removed from the que.  If you can't wait for the mail or rent Instant Video is pretty nice.  I use a Roku player, the picture was clear, sharp and was never interrupted.  Nice way to watch a current movie.
B0001EFTVA|4.0|The most accessible film of director Satoshi Kon's all-too-brief anime career. Where Perfect Blue and Paprika are more adventurous and challenging, they're also difficult to sit back and enjoy in a traditional sense without falling into a deep state of analysis. This one, of three bickering homeless chums who find an infant girl in the garbage, retains the quirks, charms and emotional punch of Kon's other works without challenging quite so many conventions. Sweet, funny and grounded, it's constantly flashing a dry wit and, although it often tugs at the heart strings, things never get overly soft or weepy. The trio of leads are diverse and interesting, each with an onion skin of personal history to explore, and their hunt for the child's parents amidst the overpopulation of a major world metropolis constantly jolts out in surprising new directions. Beautifully written, drawn and animated, it can also be a bit static and randomly fortuitous.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! It has lots of reading plans. I'm reading the One Year plan. I've also read the better reading plan. I like that it will synch between my kindle and blackberry, without missing a beat. It is helping me in my relationship with the LORD.
B001OSIV62|2.0|I don't know why many people chose to rate this movie so highly. I tried to give it an honest chance but it was just boring.

B000P0J09M|1.0|As I've seen Goodfellas many times I finally decided to look on amazon to buy it. The first (and only) time I tried to watch it the movie randomly stopped in the middle. I looked at the menu and it only went to scene 19 (right after Joe Pesci kills spider at poker). I tried it on another dvd player and it did the same thing.  I called the amazing amazon customer service and they credited the money back to me. The representative was super friendly! But the dvd didn't work properly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is AWESOME. I just don't get why the pigs are green. When was the last time you saw a green pig? I guess it's just to look cool. Still, it's a really AWESOME game.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|is really cool game and u can re-try playing it as many ways. an addictive puzzle with many endless possibilities of fun
B004A8ZWWO|2.0|This movie is a comedic representation of the stupid way of living of some ultra rich people.  It is not an exaggeration of that stupidity, but surely represents the ways of Bernie Madoff and the French guy who raped the hotel attendant.  I should have known it is a sort of fable lesson before wasting money making its purchase.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I'm not really a huge fan of \\"Video Games\\", so didn't expect I'd like the rest of Lana Del Rey's music.  I liked \\"Born to Die\\" quite a bit more, enough to check out the rest of the songs on the album.  Surprisingly, there are about 8 songs on the Born to Die Deluxe Version that I really really like.  Many of the rest are strong as well.  9 times out of 10, when I hear a song I like and begin digging into other songs by the same band/artist, I usually find that there are maybe 2 that I like on an album (at most).  That's depressing since I grew up listening to a CD from start to finish.  So kudos to Lana Del Rey for putting together a complete album with very little filler.  Of course music tastes are all about individual opinion, but I'm impressed.
0553801473|2.0|What a long and boring book.  Loved the first four but this book jumps around and nothing is finished.  What the heck!  Is Mr. Martin losing it?  I'm sorry I bought it.

B005EWDAFQ|3.0|Those familiar with Harris's previous work - in particular the excellent Fatherland - will not be surprised by the fluidity of the writing and the masterful story-telling. What may be the cause of some surprise and disappointment, however, is the nagging feeling as the plot develops that this story has been told somewhere else before. The plot centres around the world of high finance and hedge funds being managed from Geneva. Using an advanced \\"super-computer\\" one particular investment fund is able to use algorithms which can predict market movements better than any human analyst, thereby making millions for the fund and its investors. As the plot develops we discover that the management of this technology may not all be as it seems.<br /><br />The book certainly contains all the ingredients for a fast-paced thriller. The problem here is that we have seen it all before - in the classic movie, Superman 3!<br /><br />Harris earns 3 stars here for his taut writing which works perfectly in this genre. The unoriginal plot unfortunately deserves no more than 2. Approach with reservations.

0847835073|5.0|Having been disappointed with many photography book purchases on amazon, I was determined never to pick one up again.<br /><br />Then came this gorgeous book based on one of my favorite actresses, with classy pictures both nude and clothed, both color and black and white.<br /><br />Simply put:<br /><br />If you are a Monica Belucci Fan, get this book; you will not be disappointed.<br />If you do not know Ms. Belucci, the pictures are well done and artistic of this beautiful woman; you will not be disappointed.
0553386794|2.0|I heard wonderful things about this book from many people. However, I couldn't get past the way it was written. Each chapter is titled with the character it is written about. There was only one character I really liked, I found myself skipping to those chapters about 3/4 through the book. If you are looking for an action packed adventurous book, I don't suggest this one. Poor format and lack of character development will keep me from reading any more. I will watch the series on HBO though, I am hopeful they can make this something enjoyable.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|Each CD is a chapter in the book that is 'Enigma'.<br /><br />Michael Cretu is the true alchemist of music. He takes part of each musical genre and melds them into wonderfully unique sounds. Some of his songs are instrumental but they have no need of lyrics for they tell their own story. Others mix pop, rock and classical, such as 'Seven Lives'.<br /><br />I had the first CD of 'Seven Lives, Many Faces' but when I saw the availability of the second one in this 2 CD set, I ordered it even though I would have 2 of the same CD.<br /><br />From the sweet lyrics of 'The Same Parents' to the sultry sounds of 'Superficial', there is a song for everyone in this set. 'We are Nature' is fast becoming a favorite. Each time I listen, I can find yet another layer of music, a new sound or a note I hadn't heard before. This music has a way of seeping into every part of your brain, making you forget the stresses of the day.<br /><br />It's electronic, dance, ambient, rock and classical. Cretu can weave the sounds of music in such a way that it seems like you're hearing it for the first time, everytime.<br /><br />2 CD's come in an attractive case with an insert complete with lyrics to the songs, though not translated in English.<br /><br />CD 1:<br />'Encounters' (starts out like all 'Enigma' CD's but always with a twist.)<br />'Seven Lives'<br />'Touchness'<br />'The Same Parents'<br />'Fata Morgana'<br />'Hell's Heaven'<br />'La Puerto del Cielo'<br />'Distorted Love'<br />'Je t'aime Till My Dying Day'<br />'Deja Vu'<br />'Between Generations'<br />'The Language of Sounds'<br />Cd 2:<br />'Superficial<br />'We are nature'<br />'Downtown Silence'<br />'Sunrise'<br />'The Language of Sounds(slow edit)'

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun and it good definitely be a party game for most people from 9 to 99
B004LWZW8S|5.0|This is really the movie they should have made.  The original Clash of the Titans was horribly cheesy, but great at that time.  The 2010 remake left a lot to desire.  Immortals is a spectacular movie that does so much right.  It's amazing if you get over the fact that mythology isn't being represented very well which I fully understand people will hate this movie for.<br /><br />This movie was much better than 300, which I didn't particularly care for.  I think the pacing is a bit weird, it's a little too dark sometimes, pretentious and assuming at other times, but this is definitely one of the best graphic novel movies that have come out.  Sin City was great, but it felt too forced at times and got really goofy.  This movie managed to keep it's darkness more evil than campy.<br /><br />It's certainly not for everyone as the reviews show, but this was by far one of my top 5 movies of 2011.  This hasn't been a great year with movies as much as it has been an amazing TV season... but the movies of 2011 I've watched several times and know I'll watch again would be this, along with Limitless Unrated Cut, Horrible Bosses, and (gasp) In Time.  There are a few better movies, but some movies just don't have great replay value.  These are this year's movies that I've already watched several times and know I will want to watch again.  I'm not saying they're the best, they're just the movies I know I'll enjoy watching again down the road.<br /><br />I purchased this at costco today for the same price, sue me.  lol
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I have played this game before but it will not install on my android, it shuts off & resets my phone every time I try but never a successful installation.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|so why is it that so many app updates require control of the camera of the device its being loaded on?
B001AR0D4A|4.0|I'm not sure why I enjoyed this movie so much.  I think it was the character development, a familiar setting, and my suspension of reality.  And there were so many characters, from the terse neighbor to the radical born again Christian, each was given enough lines for me to care what happens to them(or not).  Put them inside a supermarket, a place we all know, and suddenly you realize what makes them vulnerable... both internal and external forces chipping away their strengths.<br /><br />There is little comic relief, except perhaps the attackers that temporarily breach the fortified supermarket walls look like their on wires.  I put myself in their shoes and accepted their circumstances as real.  As we all know, that can make movies a more enjoyable experience.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|the game is fun played three rounds won one so far you just need to figure out the curve on the ball had no problem throwing strikes got four in one game best bowling game so far
1451683405|1.0|I am going to be the contrarian here and say this book is too short to adequately treat the subject. It is more of an introductory essay, and that is all. Dr. Harris knows so much more about neurology that I wonder why he neglected to support his conclusion with more recent science to explain his anecdotes. I also was disappointed because it is impossible to glean why he bothered to publish this short essay in the first place as it adds little-to-nothing new in this fundamental human issue that he has not said before. If he hoped to convince the religious their hope in a savior is all a concoction of their brains vested in the environments of their youth and the DNA of their genes, it won't work. The problem with his conclusion that belief in free will is an illusion is that, like kids who have sat on the lap of Santa Claus, there is no convincing those whose experience - what he calls feelings - says something different. He never mentions the impact or source of faith and imagination in the human condition at all. For me, the acceptance of free will as an illusion must come from a mind that we do not control consciously any more than its opposite. Where thoughts come from he never explores. And, he never questions or explains at all who or what is the \\"we\\" or \\"you\\" or \\"I\\" that has or has not thoughts of this kind in the first place...that is the biggest mystery of all. In my view a more effective and practical approach to free will as illusion is covered in the new belief of Theofatalism, which you could google for more information if your brain so chooses. As for this one, buy it if you must. Your brain makes you do it. [[ASIN:1462022472 Theofatalism(TM): Personal Reformation for Troubled Souls]]
B0071PS7AC|3.0|It is what it is and that's bowling. It's a great time killer like waiting on your bus or your gf trying out clothes but this game is a bit lame. You only bowl then you bowl for fake money against a few opponents then the game is over. I thought maybe there would be a tournament or some kind of ranking system of some sort which would have made this a lot better. But the good stuff is the physics is nice and sound is good but again its only something you want to play if you need some time to kill for a few minutes.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|A great childhood throwback, and the original game is still around, so my 9-year old likes it too. I'm happy they made a 2 player option so we can play together. An added bonus, the checkers from this game won't be lost under the couch cushions.
B004LWZW8I|1.0|I looked forward to seeing this movie with some anticipation, but was very dissappointed when I did.  It was filmed after the style of the movie \\"The 300\\"  with deep sepia tones. Now the \\"300\\" was an excellent film, filled with fantasy, heroism, sacrifice, and excellent story telling. And even though the heros died at the end, you are not left feeling depressed.  Its too bad the same cannot be said for \\"The Immortals\\". Firstly,  \\"Immortals\\" overdid the sepia tone of the film, making it nearly impossible to see in many of the scenes.  They never developed any of the characters, and did not have a story that hung together in any coherent form.<br /><br />I found this movie to be very disappointing, and more than a little depressing.  The basic story of the movie is that King Hyperion, a tyrant apparently driven mad by the death of his family, has apparently decided to wipe out the entire human race to avenge himself on the gods.<br /><br />One of the main characters in the film is the god Zeus, who seems to be suffering from bi-polar disorder, considering how he runs both hot and cold during the movie.  Zeus, in disguise of an old man, has helped to raise and train the hero, Theseus. But he does nothing to help any other mortal, many of whom are suffering and dying all around him. When the other gods want to help the thousands of helpless human beings that are being tortured and slaughtered by Hyperion, Zeus orders that no god shall do anything to help a human, on pain of death.  His reasons for this are never made clear.  When the young god Apollo can no longer stand by and do nothing, he comes to earth and rescues Theseus right before he is about to be killed by Hyperion's men.  For this act of compassion, Zeus murders Apollo, his own son. None of the other gods so much as raise their voices in protest. Frankly I found little to choose between Hyperion and Zeus.<br /><br />The hero Theseus finds the supernatural bow, but loses it.  Even the way he loses it seems stupid. When faced with a mob of Hyperion's monstrous soldiers, he makes no move to use the power of the godly weapon. Instead he runs forward to engage the enemy with his sword. And promptly falls down a hill and drops the bow. The villians get the bow, and Theseus never gets to use it in any of the epic battles. Hyperion uses it to release the Titans, and the bow is destroyed by Zeus when the gods appear to battle the titans.  The whole idea of the supernatural bow seems more than a little anti-climaxtic.<br /><br />I could not find the point to this story. At the end, the hero Theseus gets killed, leaving his lover, the Oracle, to raise a fatherless child alone and destitute. All Theseus friends and most of the good guys get killed. Hyperion and all the bad guys get killed. All the gods (except Zeus) get killed. All the titans get killed. Basically everybody gets killed.  It's worse than the last act of Hamlet!<br /><br />There are some wonderful battle scenes that are worth seeing, and some fantastic special effects.  It is just a shame that they could not have been used in a better story.  Film makers today seem to depend entirely on special effects to carry a movie, and give almost no thought to telling a good story.<br /><br />If you want to see the movie \\"Immortals\\"  I would suggest that you rent it on cable, and not waste money buying it.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|Mediocre graphics and iffy controls definately make this one of the weaker games Amazon has offered. Like others have said it's not really worth the time it would take to become good at the game. Pass on it.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|I know there are a lot of critics who punish this movie, but to each their own, right? It is just a movie and cannot be all fact. Other than that, it was an exciting movie with great graphics and memorable characters. I definitely recommend this movie. I haven't stopped talking about it since I saw it.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|the game is good for what it is... it needs some work done, maybe a change in in the Backround. to make the game less boreing

B0052WKZZ6|5.0|There's no denying that this music comes from another place and has the power to transport the mind and soul of the listener. Oldfield composes carefully and expressively and the patient listener, without musical prejudice, can find in his first four albums something quite extraordinary. Incantations is the pinnacle of this stage of Oldfield's career and is the work of a composer at a creative peak. There is none of the whimsy or pastoral musings that can be found in Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge or Ommadawn, but instead we have a solid exploration of a theme, a cycle of four separate pieces that hold together impressively. If this album was received well at the time (and not befuddled by the arrival of the punk scene) I believe Oldfield would have been acknowledged as the excellent modern composer he is, and an album like Music of The Spheres, or something maybe a bit more experimental, would have appeared a lot sooner.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I bought this book for my kindle as my 15 year old niece is mad on it, and I see it is being released as a movie soon.  I started it quite late one night and found the whole concept of the book rather terrifying!  Am I a complete wimp, or is it the mother coming out in me, but I just thought it was awful, sending kids in to their deaths like that.  Subsequently I had a terrible sleep, with nightmares of people hunting me in the woods.  I couldn't stop reading it again the next night though, and again, more nightmares.  Finished it off today, during the day, and thank goodness they both survived, hopefully the nightmares will stop now.  Read some reviews for the next one though, and see she has to go back in the arena for Round 2!!  Will the madness ever end? (Well, obviously it does, after the third book!)  I am a 32 year old, by the way.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This cast is phenomenal. I was highly impressed by everyone. I'm not sure why everyone gave Nick Jonas such a hard time for his performance. While shaky in the beginning, he finished quite strong. You will not regret this purchase. I've already enjoyed it multiple times and look forward to many more times in the future. While it's not fully staged, the concert reading never leaves its' audience in the dark and through gestures and video images clues you in to everything that you don't necessarily see.<br /><br />Any Les Mis fan will find this enjoyable! Here's to 25 more years!

B0016492BW|5.0|As a Monty Python fan I've patiently waited for this movie to come to Blu-ray(2012) but didn't have very high expectations that it would look and sound all that good. Well I was wrong. It looks and sounds Great! And I'm not going to tell you it's an excellent movie, you already know that--great British humor(actually universal humor), ridiculously funny, great actors. And a silly price of only $9.99 (was $12.99 on release date).<br /><br />Sony did a 1080p transfer(1.66:1 original aspect ratio) of this movie that looks amazing! There's lots of strong detail in faces, clothes, as well as surroundings like buildings, grass, trees. Flesh and earth tones look very natural. Blacks are deep. Strong color is not going to jump out at you, but that's just the nature of the film as the outdoor setting of much of the movie's grass, dirt, and rocks(browns, blacks, grays & greens) never contained strong color elements. But what color there is (like in the tabards,coat of arms, shields) looks very good indeed. Is the movie without soft shots or grain? No, but they've brought out a whole lot of nicely rendered detail that makes the movie a joy to watch. Until now, I feel like I've only seen this movie through a fog. Well, the fog has finally lifted and everything looks sooo fresh.<br /><br />The audio is a lossless soundtrack (DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless). Voices sound very crisp and clear. Sound effects in general are very good. Audiofiles will notice some very rich sounding sections, but also some that are just acceptable. Overall, it is very enjoyable with nice use of surround sound and I think most people will be more than happy with it.<br /><br />LOTS OF EXTRAS: (Some New Stuff)<br />Lost Animations (1080p, 12:55) Features Gilliam animations deleted from the film. ***New for this blu-ray release***<br />Outtakes & Extended Scenes (1080p, 18:57)***New for this blu-ray release***<br /><br />MORE INCLUDED EXTRAS:(Some HD, some SD)<br />Subtitles for People Who Do Not Like the Film (From Henry IV pt. 11).<br />3 Mindless Sing-Alongs (480p, 5:10).<br />How To Use Your Coconuts (An educational Film) (480p, 2:58)<br />Quest for the Holy Grail Locations (480p, 47:00) Special Documentary<br />Cast Directory Photo Gallery (1080p).<br />Lego Knights (480p, 1:43): A lego recreation of the \\"Camelot's a silly place\\" scene.<br />Meanwhile, King Arthur & Sir Belvedere...<br />Elephant & Castle<br />Run Away!<br />The Tale of Sir Robin<br />The Tale of Sir Lancelot<br />BBC Film Night<br />Re-release Trailer<br /><br />There are a couple more Commentaries, a Japanese version of 2 scenes(English subtitles), a UV Digital Copy and some credits AND the first subtitle from the opening credits that was missing on the Special Edition DVD is back.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is great, esspecially when I'm away from home. It has all kinds of sounds and different versions of the same sounds. (like different types of frogs, or crickets w/ and w/o other sounds) and you can layer them for the perfect effect. My favorite is the Airplane cabin and fan.
0061120073|5.0|I had been meaning to read this classic coming-of-age story for years, and I'm so glad I finally did. Completely fell in love with young Francie Nolan and her family, immigrants who strived to make a better life for their children in poverty-stricken Brooklyn in the early 1900s. Heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time, this book had me both smiling and fighting back tears many times. As I reached the final pages, I slowed down my reading, because I just didn't want to say good-bye to the characters. Highly recommended.
B0050QV0RQ|2.0|I know a lot of people like this type of fighting game... but it's just not for me I guess. It isn't like role play at all. It's more like: pause: select what you want your person to do, hit go, unpause, see what happens...
0061726834|3.0|I loved the concept of this book, where a world without love was seen and mandated as a good thing, because LOVE is a disease that once plagued society and was responsible for far too many woes. The writing style was phenomenal and rich in detail. I just wish Lena had emerged faster. Like a cultist or victim of a life's worth of propaganda, her awakening did not come easily or quickly. I think it would've helped if she'd had a longing for a different world and a curiosity about it from the start, like the Little Mermaid. But she took soooooo long to start thinking outside the box that it created drag in the thick book, and it was hard to stay connected and interested. I will definitely read the sequel. I did enjoy the creepy world that was created just not the evolution of the story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app all the time. I  especially like the audio. It is so convenient to listen in the car or while doing other tasks  I enjoy listening to God's Word while doing embroidery.  It's a great way to redeem the time.  This app has a lot of nice features like reading plans, the ability to add notes and bookmarks.  Plus it's free!!  Try it; you won't be disappointed.
B0063GORYU|4.0|looks good on kindle fire . no annoying adds. able to view in profile and horizontal mode. best part is free.
B000B6CODO|4.0|I guess since your reading this you don't. Adventurous and suspenseful, characters get stuck in a board game that keeps throwing peril their way. Features Kirsten Dunst as a child. If you are a fan of her terrific acting, get Mona Lisa Smiles,in which she outshines an all-star cast.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I want to start off with that I never heard of Game of Thrones until I saw it on HBO and I loved it so much I bought the book set for my Kindle Fire and I absolutly love what I've read. Buying these all together is far cheaper than buying them seperately. I have been reading them as the first season is being re-aired on Sunday nights on HBO 2 and it has made the veiwing oh so much better as I am keeping pace with each episode as the replay. It's not only the book come to life, but it is knowing what is going through the characters thoughts as the plot unfolds in the book and TV show simaltaniuosly (now I have the DVD set which I ordered from Amazon last week and it arrived the same day it came out in stores). This is the best book series I have ever read it has surpassed Frank Herberts DUNE series as my all time favorite series ever. You feel as though you become a part of the storey as you go along.  I also love the extras with Gearge R.R. Martin explaing everything in the show and books on the 5th Disk (It's nice to get inside the authors head and here his thoughts on why he did something or his ideas in general.  I highly recommend the Game Of Thrones: The Complete First Season on Blu-Ray and say YOU ABSOLUTLY HAVE TO GET THE BOOKS AND GET THE DVD'S!!! Watch the discs as you you read the books take your time and you will have the experience of a lifetime. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, NOT EVER, NOT EVER, EVER, EVER!!! TRUST ME ON THAT!!!  I ALSO PLAN TO BUY THE ENTIRE FIRST SEASON ON MY KINDLE FIRE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT WITH ME WHERE EVER I GO (AND FOR YOU RISK FANS IF YOU BUY THE DRISK APP FOR KINDLE FIRE IT HAS EVERY VERSION OF RISK EVEN A GAME OF THRONES VERSION WHERE YOU CAN FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF THE 7 KINGDOMS WITH UP TO SIX PLAYERS EITHER 5 A.I.'S OR FRIENDS OR PEOPLE ONLINE. I RECOMMEND IT FOR GAME OF THRONES FANS)!!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app on the market! There are lots of  awesome features, its User friendly, and easy to navigate. Also very helpful for those who seek a closer walk with God and want to study the Bible more diligently.
0375869026|5.0|As a Children's and Teen Librarian, I read a lot of kid lit, yet rarely review.  I always think there are enough voices out there, but in the case of Wonder - I am making an exception.  This is one phenomenal book - the characters are well drawn and the various narrators' voices are authentic and individual.  I stayed up until 1 AM to finish my galley copy(quietly crying) and cannot wait to put the book into readers' hands.  What a debut!!!  I can hear the medals clanking already.
0375842209|5.0|I gave this book a five star review because, in the end, I was floored by how gripping the story was. I loved how the author interwove themes throughout the book -- the power of words, death, missed opportunities to express love/emotion. I'd reccommend the book, though.<br /><br />The book starts a little slow but the climax is incredibly moving and powerful. Do you know what else is probably moving and powerful? Hanging around a funeral home. But who would ever do that? Why would you want to have a front row seat to someone else's misery?<br /><br />Now don't peg me as someone who needs a story to follow a typcial plot arc, or someone who wants everything to be buttoned up in a nice clean, typical, formulaic package. I like stories that are outside the box, but I guess this one was a little too far outside the box for me. I cried hard and I can't say I enjoyed that.
B007CKB2AS|5.0|Bruce has the heart, the wisdom, and the skill to make excellent albums. And this is a good one, his best since the Rising in my opinion. It has a coherent theme, and although the music is diverse, the theme holds it together. I love the subject matter and the music. Thumbs WAY up.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I have probably read about half of Stephen King's library (including those written as Richard Bauchman) and I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The first quarter of this book was extremely interesting and I enjoyed the introduction of characters and the start of how this story was going to unfold. After we get through the first couple of adventures the story takes an almost unbearable stomp on the brakes and doesn't let up until the last ten percent of the book. And even then it's not that exciting.<br /><br />This was a real let down for me, especially since I am a fan of King's and I do enjoy historical fiction as well. This was a real drag to try and read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I Love it every one should It is awesome it rules every one should play this awesome game go on now
0061537934|5.0|This book sat on my shelf in for the longest time.  I think it was the front-cover comparison to \\"Marley and Me\\" that made me reluctant.  (I haven't actually read \\"Marley and Me,\\" but I tend to associate it with the \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" / \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" category of insipid fluff.)  After I started reading, I could not put it down.  Enzo is a wise, kind, and beautiful soul, as is his alpha human, Denny.  I'm a dog lover, and this book nails the inner life of a dog that all dog lovers know exists.  The tragic circumstances that befall Denny are not exploited for tear-jerking purposes, yet, days later, I am still tearing up.  Read, and you won't be disappointed.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very similar to the original game but with a few new twists to keep it new. Very pleasant pastime! Enjoy!

B007B8EGVI|1.0|I love this show, but the Amazon instant video is incredibly disappointing.  Although I hate Apple's ITunes store, I will have to use that in the future because this is so much worse.  I don't usually write reviews, especially bad ones, but I have had so much trouble downloading videos and completing payment (AND being doubly charged) that I will never use Amazon's Instant Video again, and I advise strongly against it.

B001BPDPTQ|5.0|Wasn't this considered a disappointment back when it came out? Despite the Raspberry hit. I liked it right away. It is a veritable symphony of Prince's talents. The introspection of Condition of the Heart has always been a favorite. Tamborine is quite an amazing little song. America rocks. Temptation had me cracking up with god sending prince to hades for his lasciviousness. I think there are probably a good number of people out there who like this one, but if you don't know it, check it out. It is quite a unique musical odyssey, one that only the uniqueness of Prince could deliver.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|I loved Connect Four when I was a kid and for the asking price of $0.99, this app is certainly cheaper than buying the physical boardgame. Of course, if you hated Connect Four, then this app is not for you, but it makes me feel like a kid again.
B004MOMT2M|1.0|First and foremost, I love Rush.  I specifically love 1979-1988 Rush, and Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures are my favorites.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS REISSUE!!!  Why?<br /><br />The CD.  The cd included has even more severe dynamic range compression than the late 90s reissue.  It's too loud and over compressed.  It sounds like total garbage, the drums are compressed into the mix and the rest of the music breathes every time a drum is hit.  Another victim of the Loudness War (look it up on wikipedia).<br /><br />The Dvd-a.  There is a high resolution stereo mix on the dvd...BUT IT'S THE SAME OVER-COMPRESSED TOO-LOUD MASTER OF THE CD!!!!  People that buy DVD-A and other high resolution formats really do care about sound quality, so why put the stereo version on it that's meant to \\"compete\\" with other loud, over-compressed cds?  And the surround mix suffers from the same issue.  On my volume meter, this music moved only 2 of the ten segments on my display.<br /><br />The surround mix itself is total crap.  Too call it \\"subtle\\" is a massive understatement.  Almost all the reverbs are lessened, especially on the vocals.  It kills the feel of the original mix.  The only things to appear in the back speakers are mirror images of the guitar track in the front, and sometimes a synthesizer.  It's the worst surround mix I've ever heard.  The Police's Best of and Depeche Mode's albums have what I would consider \\"subtle\\" surround mixes.  These Rush surround mixes are not immersive or  exciting in any way.  It sounds like listening to a stereo mix run through a DSP to spread it out a bit more.<br /><br />In all, this disc is NOT worth buying.  Save your money, if you want a good version of Moving Pictures, get the 80s Mercury cd issue or the MOFI remaster.  If you want a good surround mix of Rush, too bad.  Buy this disc and you'll be immensely disappointed.  I'd give this zero stars if I could.

1401937519|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best book ever published in the English language (and I suspect any language) of a single near death experience. It may also be one of the most important books ever published on the way we treat and view ourselves. I have known the author personally for several years, but the above statement (and others like it below) are not a result of this. Rather, the exact reverse is the case: Anita's scintillating honesty, her authenticity on all aspects of her experience, the love and integrity of commitment between Anita and Danny (her husband) who saw her through the entire ordeal of cancer, her compassion and care for the healing of others through the self-realizing of their own Magnificence, her intelligent, playful, wholesomely un-guru-like personality in the wake of such an extraordinary event having happened to a human being, is precisely what generated the friendship. When I had a most difficult and delicate personal issue to deal with a few years ago, I chose Anita to confide in, even though we had not known each other very long. I disclose this fact only to illustrate how highly I rate this person's integrity and authenticity.<br /><br />Those who know me on the NDE circuit know that I can also be a real stickler for evidence in the claims made for remarkable experiences (on this issue, more below), but with Anita it was just, purely and simply, never an issue. There is something about this kind of sincerity and honesty that just shines straight through, by the shortest path, like rays beaming through a stained glass window. I knew it. I saw it. And like the rays through the window, no one needed to say \\"we need to do some research to see if that is sunlight.\\"<br /><br />Anita is not a saint or an Ascended Master. I believe she would be horrified to be regarded as either. She is a real human being, not a Levitating Adept. She can be funny, silly, and just too plain fond of chocolate and ice cream, like the rest of us. In fact, I'm not yet*entirely* convinced that she didn't come back from the other side just for the ice cream...but that's another story.<br /><br />Okay, so to the book. We've come a long way since Dante's Inferno haven't we? Sinners punished in an obsessive and disturbingly peculiar hierarchy of levels, each described in a kind of manic, fascinated detail (this is the Inferno, of course). Anita's book is like the absolute antipodes of the `Inferno'. Instead of a world in which we are already corrupt, fallen, sinful, begging for salvation, stamped on the foreheads with cosmic wrongness from the moment of our birth, Dying To Be Me inverts this picture and says no, that's all wrong. We are not miserable, \\"sinful\\", imperfect fleshly contraptions groveling at the divine chair for admission and redemption, in the hope that some pittance of grace will be tossed our way like pennies showered from the gloved and complacent hand of some passing monarch. Rather we ARE the divine, both occupant and chair, as well as tapestries, draperies, and the entire royal chamber. We don't need to seek grace because we are the grace that we seek. We don't need to hunt down, Sherlock Holmes style, the light of the divine, because the very act of arduous seeking blinds us to noticing ourselves as a powerful source of emission.  This is Anita's message. How could we ever have fallen, before, for such a dysfunctional and crippling view of life and the cosmos? As if universal force creates us to pity us? To crush us down? To emphasize our smallness? The central message of this book is that we should simply *allow* the essential nature that nature herself intends for us.<br /><br />For myself, the section on Anita's younger years in Hong Kong really helped fill in some blanks and bring to life the whole picture for me. Everything from eating at the Bladerunner-esque Dai Pai Dong in the street, to sipping tea from little cups with tigers or dragons on them, to the vivid depiction of the `hungry ghost festival\\" andleaving empty seats at the dinner table for the famished dead. More importantly, based on what I hear in this section, it now seems a lot more evident to me, from the patterns she discloses of her childhood, that her fear really was a principal causal factor in her illness. You can sense its systemic presence through all the chapters of her childhood; it is there always, like a crouching bear, this sense of inadequacy, of trying constantly to measure up to essentially impossible and unreasonable standards, and of course (at that stage of life) failing.<br /><br />Turning to the issue of evidence, I don't think it is the most important thing in this case, but it is important enough in the subject at large, I feel, that I would like to mention it. The field of near death research is not without its problems. There are bogus experiences in circulation. Claims of medical events that evaporate when the least investigative pressure is brought to bear on them. These claims subtly (or not so subtly) undermine accounts like Anita's, because the public and the endless ranks of armchair experts, a nontrivial portion of which would still dearly like to dismiss ALL these experiences as not worth the paper they are printed on, are apt to tar all with the one brush. Well, the present account is not one of these. In fact, in terms of medical evidence presented, again even though I don't consider it the most important element of Anita's experience by far, it simply does not get any better than this in a published volume. The places and the doctors involved are named in the text. A full, detailed report written by a cancer specialist is included in the text. This is the only published near death experience I have seen, anywhere, EVER, that has got this right, and I have taken the trouble to make myself familiar with the great majority of them. The only comparison that even approaches was the case of Pam Reynolds, but that did not involve an anomalous healing. The evidential status of Anita Moorjani's case is singular and impeccable.<br /><br />The cancer reversal is (in our worldly thinking anyway) the most remarkable aspect of Anita's story. The aforementioned cancer specialist had this to say in his report:<br /><br />**minor spoiler alert**<br />\\"Based on my own experience and opinions of several colleagues, I am unable to attribute her dramatic recovery to her chemotherapy. Based on what we have learned about cancer cell behaviors, I speculate that something (non-physical...\\"information\\"?) either switched off the mutated genes from expressing, or signaled them to a programmed cell death. The exact mechanism is unknown to us, but not likely to be the result of cytotoxic drugs.\\"<br /><br />I have some background in biology, and genetics, and it is scarcely possible to overemphasize the significance of what is being said in this statement. But here's the problem: just another \\"medical fixit\\" is not going to solve this conundrum. There is *not going to be* an undiscovered protocol,  a daring surgical procedure, a new type of scanner, an inrush of nanobots, a new cocktail of drugs worthy of being shaken and stirred by Tom Cruise...that is going to solve this matter. Because Anita was healed, self-healed, by direct unobstructed agency of the same universal life principle acting in her and through her, as gave rise to genes and bodies and doctors in the first place. All attempts to hunt the snark down other rabbit holes will finally lead to frustration. That was the \\"information\\" provided to the system. When Anita's consciousness was aligned in the native state with this universal source of life, aligned like Atman-Brahman, she said \\"I/We want to live\\", and since it was the universe itself that was saying it, there could scarcely be any dissenters.<br /><br />Once that happened, what took place in the cells of the body was merely like \\"handing a clerk some forms to sign.\\" The miracle was not that she was healed. Nothing short of a miracle, eitheron this earth or off it, could have *stopped* her from being healed.<br /><br />This is the secret passage that medicine needs to explore, with humility and sincerity, if it really wants to deepen its potency for the ability to heal. Medicine has had its successes, and we should applaud those successes, but the fact is, even in a simple case such as bone-knitting,  that nature does the healing, and we simply help to clear its path. That doesn't mean that we can't do anything. It doesn't mean there aren't intriguing possibilities and new directions to explore. But it does mean that just another mechanism, just another medicine, is not going to cut it. If the cause is in a high level (meaning-rich) expression or thwarted expression of the life principle, colloquially what we call the \\"spiritual\\", then messing around with pharmaceuticals and high tech instruments will be like trying to get rid of political corruption by deleting names from the telephone book.<br /><br />Anita's particular cancer seems to have had this kind of cause. Now we live in a complex world of multifactorial causes. No one, and I'm sure Anita would agree with this, should conclude that the same cause holds in every case. BUT, even in those other cases, with different causes, such as ageing, exposure to radiation, or even other diseases altogether, so much unexpected light may in the future be shed even on those cases by open-minded pursuit of this type of case, that a whole-hearted exploration is more than worth the doing. There is more to all this than just some new age fad. In the fifties, a boy was cured, by treatment with hypnosis, of congenital icthyosiform erythroderma of Brocq, a hideous condition capable of causing almost total skin coverage of hard, horned scale (icthyosis). There's a thread here. The consciousness cannot be left out of the picture, not if we really want to get to grips with this. And this is surely the most important direction in which Anita's account should launch us:how others can also be brought to this kind of healing.  But it is not just the technique that will have to change; it is the people behind the gloves...and this is not a concept that Western Medics are used to.<br /><br />I was also glad of the way that Anita placed the emphasis on this life, and not the \\"afterlife\\". Although not everyone will agree with me here, I think another signal breakthrough of Anita's case, and her book, is that it begins to wrest the near death experience away from the somewhat clammy hands of the \\"life after death\\" brigade, with which it has \\"too long languished\\", to coin a phrase. Again, the message of Anita's experience is not some hurried affair in which we frown our way through life as quickly as possible, like so many grim commuters with the brims of our hats pulled down low against the rain, in  order to get to some promised land \\"elsewhere\\". Life, the universal creative principle, is pouring itself in to *this* world, to this universe, to the now. It is pouring itself IN, with passion, with vigor, not OUT. On this point I agree with Anita absolutely, and it has been my own view for a long time. \\"The main show\\" as the author states it, is \\"here\\", not \\"there\\". This doesn't mean that an extraordinary state or harmony and fulfillment is impossible. It simply means that we have been too hasty (as the Ents would say) in assuming that life was seeking it, building it, elsewhere, and not right here in the universe of action and expression. I think, myself, that this offers a much healthier vision of the near death experience, and Anita's experience may signal a turning point in the way that said experience is glossed and understood in society. Rather than a portal to a realm that is in some sense an idealized continuation of our human life, experiences such as Anita's suggest more that the near death event is a kind of interface between the dynamic, active, expressing realm of being (the \\"here\\") and the underlying Fundament or potential which is the high octane source behind it all. But the Fundament isn't satisfied just being potential. It wants to be active, it wants to express, it wants the \\"here\\". Thus Anita, the universe as Anita, realized not only that she wanted to come back, but that it was good to come back; it was good and joyous to express again as Anita Moorjani. In a sense, the needy hankering after an afterlife, like all needy hankering, short-circuits this joyousness. We need to trust that the Fundament is simply always there. It's not going anywhere. We will always be it.<br /><br />I don't agree with absolutely everything that Anita says. For instance, the commentary on rapists and murderers was not particularly convincing to me, for reasons I won't indulge to go into here. But I don't think Anita would mind this. As I say, she is not a guru and I suggest that people don't treat her as such. She does not have the answer to everything, nor should she be expected to. That's a bit too much responsibility for one person! And after all, one of the very reasons we may all be different is precisely because each one of us is capable of bringing unique contributions, and insights, to the structure of existence and this magical (though admittedly sometimes confounding) thing called life.<br /><br />However, that is a minor matter. I do in fact agree with the great majority of what Anita says, a situation that I can honestly say has occurred only about two or three times in forty years of reading.<br /><br />Make no mistake. You will count on the fingers of one hand the number of times a book like this, an opportunity like this, presents itself to you in your lifetime. I won't quite go so far as to say that you should drop everything and read this book. No wait: actually, I *will* go that far...you should drop everything and read this book. No, really. I'm not kidding. No...REALLY, I'm not kidding.  I am extremely selective in what I choose to endorse, and this is, without qualification, my biggest endorsement ever. I'm even slightly embarrassed because it is so out of character for me. Anita is not in this for the money. But from me to you, for the few dollars you spend on this book, I personally guarantee you that it will repay its value one hundred fold before you even reach the back cover. Don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />I am proud to call Anita Moorjani my friend. And I am profoundly glad she is in the world...first for Danny, and secondly for the world.

0374531269|3.0|A student gave me a book to read a couple weeks ago and it wasn't about vampires, werewolves or teenage angst, so I of course had to give it a shot. \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is a memoir written by Ishmael Beah, and gives a firsthand account of the civil war in Sierra Leone and the ongoing plight of child soldiers. It was both gut-wrenching and thought-provoking, and I was really impressed that a 13 year old appreciated it enough to pass it along to me.<br /><br />I do however, have a criticism of the book. While it certainly makes for a compelling read, I do wonder about the accuracy of the story Beah relates. It is as if every horror story of children in war happens to this one unfortunate child, and to be honest it stretches believability. My curiosity piqued, I did a little research and found I am not the only one who found \\"A Long Way Gone\\" a hard pill to swallow.<br /><br />  \\"In one instance, Beah describes in vivid detail a deadly brawl between two rival factions of child soldiers in a UNICEF-run camp in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown in January of 1996. Six teens died, Beah recalls--but The Australian could find no one in Freetown who could remember the incident, and no official report of the fight. Reporters who covered the civil war told The Australian that it would have gotten enormous attention at the time.\\"<br /><br />What is most depressing about the possibility that this story is embellished is that authors feel the need to do this in the first place. A quieter but more realistic tale of the experiences of a child in war would have been just as gripping and eye opening.

0307463745|1.0|I love finding great books to recommend to clients.  This book got so much great buzz that I read it with high hopes.  I really wanted to love it, but I couldn't.<br /><br />It wasn't the conciseness of the book overall, or the fact that only about half of the 271 pages contain real content (others have graphics and chapter titles or a couple of lines continued from the previous page.)  I like books that are simple, short and straight forward, if they make good use of the reader's time by packing a lot of punch into few words and a great concept.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think this book tries to cover too much ground in too few pages.  The topics are diverse and plentiful:  hiring employees, getting unstuck, doing damage control, being productive, creating company culture, competing... the list goes on.  Nearly 90 mini-chapters are arranged into 12 chapter headings.<br /><br />With only one or two pages (of large font with generous spacing) devoted to each topic, the result is a lot of advice that I read as overly simplistic to the end of being mostly unusable.<br /><br />For instance, in an early chapter we're told not to plan, because plans are guesses and that we should just wing it.  I think that is really bad advice.  Can people always achieve 100% of what they put on their plan?  Nope, sometimes they make their best effort and miss anyway.  Do they sometimes need to reassess their plan and change things?  Absolutely, but that's not a reason to throw out planning.  I'd rather they tell us how to do it right; when to use a plan and how to use it effectively.<br /><br />Likewise, a lot of meetings are badly run and unproductive.  The authors recommend throwing meetings out altogether and, for the reader that can't see their way to doing that completely, they throw out a few suggestions that miss the point entirely in terms of how to make meetings productive, collaborative, and \\"more than the sum of the parts\\" the way orgs need them to be.<br /><br />To be fair, there are some righteous pearls of wisdom.  They tend to come more at the end of the book so you've got to hang in to get there - or just skip over the other stuff.  But the good advice really isn't anything new.  One is \\"own your bad news... When something bad happens, tell your customers.  Don't think you can just sweep it under the rug.\\"  Another is to watch our use of the words \\"everyone, no one, always, and never.\\"<br /><br />This last is good advice and I realize that it pointed to the reason this book bugged me. Even when the authors didn't use the words explicitly, I heard the words consistently in the messaging.  Yet there was little in the simplistic advice that seemed to apply to everyone or no one, or always or never.

0439023483|3.0|This book has been getting so much hype lately and was recommended to me by some friends.  I happened to read it along with my 6th grade daughter.<br /><br />While the descriptions and fantasy in this book is extremely creative I had one major problem with it.  The fact that the main character a very strong young woman, needs a man to \\"win\\" the Games.  Not only that she needs to win-over the audience and in doing so needs to lead this young man on.  She basically changed who she was as a person to win and exchanged a real friendship for faux romance.  It made me sad that this was the case.  Perhaps this is a commentary on society, or it is just how it is but when will we have current literature that honors a young woman's strength and fierceness without the need of a \\"man\\" to help or to entirely change who she is?
B006JJBFK0|5.0|To piggy-back on the two reviewers before me, they are right on. This album is different from previous Xandria releases in that it sounds more \\"epic\\" (in lack of better terms). \\"Neverworld's End\\" introduces us to soprano Manuela Kraller, Xandria's new front woman. And they could not have found a better replacement. If only Nightwish had gotten their hands on her when Tarja Turunen left the band :)! With this change of vocal talent, Xandria sounds less goth/industrial oriented than they did before, and more operatic (think of old-school Nightwish). As the previous reviewer mentioned, if you liked Xandria's old sound, this may not be your cup of tea, but if you enjoy Tarja/Nightwish, Epica, and Amberian Dawn, this might be right up your alley.<br /><br />Again, I am nothing but impressed with this album. I am eagerly awaiting future releases.
B007CKB2AS|4.0|Let's face it: Bruce Springsteen thrives in hard times.  After 9/11, he and the E Street Band crafted their most diverse recording to date, THE RISING.  During the later Bush years, we got MAGIC, filled with political angst.  Even the hope Springsteen felt during the Obama candidacy was tinged with the crumbling financial and moral state of America on the criminally-underrated WORKING ON A DREAM.<br /><br />WRECKING BALL is similar in theme to the latter, with the emphasis shifted: the optimism here is shaky at best, transparent at its most haunting.  The title track and \\"Death to My Hometown\\" are perfect examples of this.  Even the go-get-'em lead single, \\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" isn't as rousing as it initially feels; beneath its currents, beneath even the hopeful \\"We Are Alive,\\" lies a troubled soul taking stock of America, and not hating, but not liking, what he sees.<br /><br />Sonically, Springsteen seems to go back in time.  WORKING ON A DREAM dug into the sixties/seventies sound; here, Springsteen goes back to the Americana and Irish-tinged ballads that gave us THE SEEGER SESSIONS (the deluxe version of WRECKING BALL includes a studio version of \\"American Land\\") and LIVE IN DUBLIN.  Strangely enough, this old sound meshes nicely with some of the newer, poppier tracks (see: \\"Rocky Ground\\"), reminiscent of THE RISING.<br /><br />Springsteen also delves into his own catalog for \\"Land of Hope and Dreams;\\" it's nice to hear a new, studio version of the song, though it would have been even nicer to hear a newer tune.  This bunch is strong, with a definite folksy vibe running (appropriately) through them, tinged with the arena rock that is both a blessing (he pretty much perfected it) and a curse (it's better live than on record).  However, the absence of the E Street Band is glaringly obvious, especially that of the late Clarence Clemons (who receives a touching tribute in the liner notes), and their reliable musicianship could've helped the Boss restrain some of his grander tendencies.  As is, WRECKING BALL remains nothing short of good, and occasionally great, but fans will probably be hitting that back catalog to remind themselves of albums that were nothing short of great, and occasionally perfect.f his grander tendencies.

The sound is a combination of the E Street and the Pete Seeger bands, which works well on this material. When all of a sudden Clarence's sax soars up in \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" as Linda Richman would have said, you'll get \\"faclemt.\\" This is the right send-off for the Big Man.

B000BKJ78U|5.0|I actually bought it for my dad as a gift and he loved them. I only buy what I like so of course I love the original Star Wars movies (and I wanted to keep it for myself). They qualify as 100% \\"Classics\\" in my eyes!
1451627289|1.0|I have never read a Stephen King book, and the premise of this novel looked interesting.  However, it is aganozing slow and repetitive and lacks suspense.  It is basically a short story that could have been told in 20 pages, but has been spread out onto 849 pages.
0060751967|3.0|This is a adult romance series. It's mostly about good vampires, but has some shapeshifters too. I've read about ten of them, and they can be read in any order. Usually we find a human girl falling in love with a good vampire, but in later books we have shapeshifters finding romance as well. The good vamps drink bottled synthetic blood and fight the bad vamps who kill humans. They must sleep all day while being guarded by humans and shapeshifters.<br /><br />The bad.<br />The vamps have silly outrageous powers like telaportation and mind control, and some can even be made human again! Serious vamp fans might find her vamps to be outrageous and even offensive. Most vamps are from some other country, Scottland? and talk in accents. They are all similar until they get to star in their own book. The actually sex is exactly the same in every book I read. Even the shapeshifters follow the same manual.<br /><br />The good.<br />The best thing about these is the comedy. Not far into the book and even during the foreplay scenes, you'll be laughing your head off. The star human girl characters are good and very interesting along with the star vamp she falls for. The romance is also nice as we watch them fall in love. The plots are always good. Though they follow the same overall guidline, each has something new and interesting going on. Kudos to this author always being able to make her new story entertaining and even enjoyable. You can really enjoy about five of these. Any five. Any more and the repeated romance formula, and ending action turn into a bore. These silly books won't win any awards, but if you like adult romance, vamps, and want to laugh, give one a try.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|This is the third time I have rented a movie without reading that is was a foreign language film.  And, this is the third time I was so happy I rented 3 films of different languages and I loved them all.  There was Sara's Key, Incendies, and now The Skin I Live In.  There is something about these foreign made films that is so much deeper than American's make.  The stories do not follow the same patterns as American stories do, and they suck you in and hold your attention because the endings are extraordinary and different and sometimes bizzare, but great.  I started the film with \\"Oh, another foreign film,\\" and became so mesmerized I couldn't leave it until the end.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|It's a lyrical masterpiece mixed with a heavy \\"call to arms\\" beat.  It's a revolution for the soul of a hardworking man or woman mixed and intergrated with the music that run deep in rock n' roll, folk and multi-cultural influence.  Brilliant move using session players on the tracks that make this gem come alive.<br /><br />Different strokes for different folks but I find the same arguments against Bruce's newer music from those either 1) do not want to hear music addressing political and modern social issues and their root cause, 2) what #1 does to the human spirit and how music can fortify the spirit, or 3) 70's Bruce fans wanting to hear about hemis and replays of \\"Out In the Street\\".  I remember Bruce fans saying he took a cheap road with the song \\"She's the One\\" and now its a classic.<br /><br />This album addresses uncomfortable situations and tells us that if we stick to our ideals, we can survive the battles.  The recording...perfect.  I wish Darkness on the Edge of Town had the same ambient noise instead of the muffled kill of it with an over-padded recording studio.  Folks, it's a beautiful album and heavy but Bruce let's us know we're all strong enough to pick it up!!!  Love it.!!!
1594744769|5.0|This book by its cover seems like a thriller and in fact turns out to be fantasy. I loved every page of this book and want more. I don't care how many adjectives he wrote and the tone stayed quite the same through out all of the book. I can't wait for the second book. Great Job!!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|it's amazing how the right choices aren't always the most beneficial. Great movie. The A's GM chooses to go against traditional methods of running a baseball team. Pitt's dynamic with his daughter and his trust for Hill's character truly make this an epic movie about knowing what popular belief is yet making the dedicated decision to stick to your core beliefs. 10/10...a deep thought type of movie tapping into the psychology/science/passion of modern American professional baseball.
0307279189|4.0|I've tried running a half dozen times since cross country in high school, which has led to minor injuries every time. After reading this book I decided to give it another shot- barefoot this time (well, with the Vibram Five Fingers). I also ditched my motion-control running shoes after reading the discussion about the running shoe industry.<br /><br />I wasn't even planning on running again before reading this book, which I picked up on a friend's recommendation. I don't even like the author's writing style- he seems to make things grander than they really are, and the book feels very drawn out. Nonetheless, the book inspired me to give it another shot. Its arguments are pretty convincing, and some of its characters inspiring. I've even made it my goal to do a 50 mile race within a year.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|the game controls are too easy. once you find the 'magic spot' to release the ball from, you get a strike every time. boring. also, when you win money, it doesn't go towards anything. no upgrade to the game play. it just adds dollars up for no specific purpose.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I found this to be an improvement over much of King's later works,for the most part it was well paced,& kept me interested in what would happen next.It was interesting that Mr.King was so readily able to make the reader feel as if he himself had stepped back in time,without seeming to give a history lesson.The premise of going back in time to save Kennedy I found intriguing,along with the characters King develops along the way.I won't give it away,but Mr.King doesn't disappoint in his ending of the book with the stock ending 99% of other authors would have used.All in all a good read!My one complaint is I was never able to access the 13 minute film narrated by King for some reason.
0446556750|5.0|This is my favorite of the Bosch/Haller books. I read it in one 24 hour period, not budging until I had finished it. It had everything: cold case, sympathetic witness, Bosch/Haller family interactions, evil defendant. And fear - wondering where the killer was going to strike....<br /><br />I'm going to say that I liked it so much better than some of the Bosch solo novels. Everything that Bosch and Haller did together was like music to the ears.

0439023513|3.0|I have to agree with most of the readers who sided with this book being a disappointment.  I felt the first two books were done well and you're hooked into the characters.  By the third book, I felt like we (the readers) missed some of the best parts because Katniss was either hurt or recovering.  I feel the ending was a total let down when I'm told the ending instead of the characters working their way back to each other and taking the reader along for the ride.<br /><br />Have I said I was disappointed?<br /><br />Overall, the series was compelling, but I wish the author would have taken more time to develop book three.  I felt it was really rushed with a lot of 'telling' the reader instead of 'showing'.

B0059XTV4Y|2.0|If you're a fan of films like \\"The King's Speech\\" (2010), \\"The Queen\\" (2006), and \\"Anonymous\\" (2011) that give you a peek behind the screen of the royal family, you're going to be woefully disappointed in \\"W.E.\\", a 2012 film about the love affair between King Edward VIII and a married American woman, Wallis Simpson - an affair that led to Edward's abdication in December 1936 and the ascension of George VI whose eldest daughter Elizabeth, reigned for more than 50 years and as of this date, remains on the throne.<br /><br />In addition to a cursory examination of the Wallis/Edward (hence W.E.) affair, there is a concurrent story about a former Sotheby researcher who is obsessed with the story, not only because she was named after Wallis, but also because her own marriage is under strain and she hopes in some way that learning more about Wallis and Edward may assist her.<br /><br />Two half told stories do not a good film make. Indeed, half told tales diminish rather than enhance a film, so that the two parts of this film - Edward and Wallis in the 1930s and Wally and William in the present - really do injustice to both stories.<br /><br />But all is not lost, because the contemporary story gives us a look at a really fine actress, Australia born Abbie Cornish whose work has been primarily in Australian and British TV and films. Cornish plays the modern day Wallis, and she does such a fine sensitive job that I wish this were a film about her, rather than a device to serve as a counter point to the Wallis/Edward affair.<br /><br />James D'Arcy plays King Edward. D'Arcy had primarily been a British TV actor. He's probably best known for co-starring in \\"Master and Commander\\" (2003) as 1st Lt. Tom Pullings.<br /><br />Pretty Andrea Riseborough plays Simpson. She was nominated for a BAFTA for the TV movie \\"Margaret Thatcher\\" The Long Walk to Finchley\\" (2008) and the British Independent Film Society nominated her for \\"Most Promising Newcomer\\" for \\"Brighton Rock\\" (2010). She is virtually unknown to US audiences.<br /><br />James Fox, who plays King George V, is the only well known actor (\\"Patriot Games\\", \\"The Servant\\", \\"A Passage to India\\"), but if you sneeze you'll miss him.<br /><br />Given the talented actors, what went wrong? Apart from the half told tale problem alluded to above, perhaps the major fault with the film is that it is virtually impossible to see what attracted Edward to Wallis. The film ignores anything to do with the central question - why would a man give up a kingdom for a woman? The film continually tells us that Edward is obsessed with Wallis, and it shows us Edward being obsessed with Wallis, but we are left to wonder why. In an aside, it's suggested that she dressed better than anyone else, and as seemingly silly as this may be, it is the only clue we have.<br /><br />There's another problem with the film, and this is the continual shifting between real footage (news reels and newspapers) of Edwards and Wallis and reconstructed footage with the actors superimposed. There seems to be no pattern to when this happens, leading me to think that they simply ran out of money to complete the task. As presented, the shift is jarring and is a constant reminder that we are watching a film with actors - a deadly thrust at the heart of any film.<br /><br />All these problems can be laid at the foot of writer/director Madonna who is best known as a singer, although her second career in film is also notable. She acted in more than 20 films, winning a Golden Globe for \\"Evita\\" (1996) although winning a Razzie (worst actress) for \\"Swept Away\\" (2002), \\"Die Another Day\\" (2002), \\"The Next Best Thing\\" (2000), \\"Four Rooms\\" (1995), \\"Body of Evidence\\" (1993), \\"Who's That Girl\\" (1987) and \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" (1986).<br /><br />W.E. is her fourth film as a writer and second film as a director. None of her other efforts received any type of award, although W.E. did get an Oscar nomination for Costume Design.<br /><br />Of course the film is not totally without merit. It is visually attractive and it's always good to get a peek at actors who otherwise appear on TV and films in other countries. There are also a few moments when the camerawork is exceptional as it visually tracks extreme closeups of facial features while underscoring the theme offered in the scene (something Sergio Leone did very well in a very different context). But these few crumbs will not provide sufficient sustenance for a 2+ hour film.<br /><br />Roger Ebert called it \\"an elegant, ambitious and relentlessly monotonous film\\" and said \\"there is little human interest or excitement.\\" The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"as easy on the eyes and ears as it is embalmed from any dramatic point of view.\\"<br /><br />The film opened in February 2012 and did less than $50,000 in its opening weekend. Poor as this may appear, films like this generally don't do well when they open - \\"The Queen\\" (2006) made only $122,014 and \\"The King's Speech\\" made $355,450. \\"Anonymous\\" was an exception with more than $1 million.<br /><br />Bottom line - a dull film that offers no insight into the Wallis/Edward affair.s not totally without merit.

B001DPC52C|5.0|My first experience with this band was \\"The Unforgiving\\" which I think is one of best Symphonic Metal studio albums I have heard.  I went back and picked up most of their previous recordings which were pretty good but I didn't feel any of them were as good as \\"The Unforgiving\\".  I then purchased this thinking that it would be like seeing a live show without having to go to Europe or wait for them to visit the US again.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by the level of the performances and the beauty of the arrangements.  I think Sharon is a gifted singer with a combination of a great natural voice and an outstanding sense of how to use it to really fit the songs.  She can sing just about anything and pairs that with a wonderful tone and stunning use of dynamics.<br /><br />The rest of the band can really play and the arrangements and use of the orchestra totally fit into each song.  Nothing sounds as good to me as live music played really well and I really love when bands change songs to make them sound better or change them to sound even better live than the recordings.<br /><br />On top of the music sounding great the video portion of the concert is awesome.  I've watched it repeatedly and I see new things each time.<br /><br />GO BUY IT, NOW!!!
030788743X|5.0|I bought this book solely on the hype created by its reviews... money well spent.  I am a product of the eighties so the story-line and associated subject matter couldn't have been more apropos - but \\"Ready Player One\\" exceeded my expectations.  I actually smiled and had to put the book the book down for a moment when Cline referenced the film \\"Better Off Dead\\" - not by using the title of the movie - but rather by mentioning an obscure Howard Jones' song that plays in the background of one of the most famous scenes from the movie - \\"like to get to know you well\\" indeed.  I felt like I was part of the game as I realized what he was writing about and could hear the song in my head and see the scene in my mind.  I immediately put the soundtrack to the film on in the background for the rest of my reading of the novel.  Well done Mr. Cline.  Thank you for a terrific piece of writing.  Keep up the good work.

B001NPDCFQ|5.0|A film which has everything perfect, combining music, humor, and drama, and executed by a first rate cast. Special praise must be given to the truly memorable performance by Margaret O'Brien, and the directorial skills of Vincente Minelli. The Blu-ray transfer is outstanding, showcasing all that three strip Technicolor is famous for. Very highly recommended
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really awesome app. eclveyone should download it and play it all of the time. it is so great!
0545265355|5.0|This is a must read, especially if you're going to see all of the movies! I was introduced to this book by my English teacher [I'm a freshman in highschool] and the whole class was reading it, even the guys! Now that everyone at our school is starting to be interested in the hunger games, we're planning on taking an out-of-school-hours field trip to see the first book's movie in theaters!<br /><br />Its a story of a girl, Katniess, who has a mom and younger sister, Primrose. Katniss goes hunting with her friend Gale to support their families. Then theres another round of drawings for who participates in the bloody, inhumane Hunger Games and her sister gets picked! Katniss volunteers as tribute to save Primrose from having to fight in the games and the story basically unravels from there.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|This game is so uninspired it's sad. Your opponent just fades on and then of the screen when it's their turn. The textures are just flat. You get &quot;paid&quot; when you win, but there's no way to spend that money. Just lame.

B002IFT1ZA|4.0|The show itself is quite possibly the best TV show I've had the pleasure of viewing in my life.  It encouraged me to read the books, and greatly anticipate the new season coming april 1st.  Heck this is the only TV show that I've ever purchased a entire season of. The show itself takes place mainly in the semi-magical world of westeros (magic doesn't play much of part in the first season, and in all honesty isn't too large in the first 5 books mainly thought of as non-existent). In the first season the show mainly focuses around three Noble Houses, The Lannisters, the richest family in Westeros, the primary antagonists, the Starks, The primary protagonists and honorable lords of Winterfell, and the Targareans a family formally ruling westeros before a rebellion removed them from the land roughly two decades prior to the show.  The show is mainly about the power struggle of a medieval society through a political aspect (their are some battles but are generally not the focal point and glossed over).  The plot is amazing the casting impeccable as is the filmography. The show itself well deserves 5 stars, it is a faithfully adaption of the novels, and is stupidly well done.<br /><br />The reason why it gets 5 stars, is because I was expecting some more extra content in the show.  The commentary is good so far, I'm currently on the 4th episode, the first one was informative with the directors doing the comments, the second fun using the cast of the royals, the third cute using the children actors, the fourth is alright so far it uses a writer and the bastard Jon Snow, the first three there was a lot of commentary between the first three and is a nice addition, outside of that there is much to talk about there is a character charts to help explain some characters from their actors perspective and a map.  I wish there was more like explaining maybe a bit about the different religions and the maesters who play a rather important part in the ruling of the lands of westeros,and really  just the large amount of back story that you can't always convey into a tv show.  So while the show it's self deserves 5 stars, the dvd box additions just aren't 5 star material and I'm review the box not the show, so I'll give it a 4.5, but since I can't give a half I'll round it down to four.

B0071PS7AC|4.0|Played this even before looking at the other reviews, not sure why so many negative votes. It's not perfect, but I still find myself enjoying this.<br /><br />Rather like bowling for real, I find myself doing the hip dance when the ball strikes the pins, like how we used to jump on the couch when making Mario jump. That's usually a sign of immersion, not the marketing-speak type of \\"immersion\\" but just forgetting your surroundings and getting into the game, like when you find your concentration drifting and paying more attention to the \\"players\\" on either side of you.<br /><br />Not sure why people haven't grasped that money thing is just a scoring system. Even simple games like rummy, with multiple hands, have a running score. Same here with the money. Even so, would be nice of we could buy different colored balls, or unlock backgrounds, music, and so forth.<br /><br />It could use some tweaking, things I'd like to see:<br /><br />Addressing the situation of a gutter ball followed by a pickup spare. The game logs it as a strike on the second roll, but it really should be a spare.<br /><br />I'd like some options to practice, or at least bowl single player.<br /><br />The girl is kind of funny with her expressions like when she misses what is an easy spare, but I would like to be able to turn her off to speed up playing.

1612130283|2.0|With all of the hype, I was really looking forward to reading this. After getting through half the book, I am extremely dissapointed with the writing. Half of the page content throughout the same reference to his deep grey eyes or her inner goddess. It almost felt a bit like Twilight with the repetitiveness and unnecessary detail at times. It felt immature at times but I understand the age of the characters created this perception for me. I will finish the book but don't think I will read the rest of the series. If you really want to read good erotica, O is the best book written (in my opinion). Captivating, original and not 600 pages long. I will say that while I am not a huge fan of this book, kudos to the author for having the courage, creativity and tenacity to get this published. Look forward to seeing what E.L. James writes in the future.
B0064X79JC|5.0|This book epitomized the noir-style that made the movie based upon it so successful.  You immediately connect with driver and understand the simple motivation behind him.  He drives.<br />The book flashes back and forth, which gives you an opportunity to learn a little more about the character, but the overall story is paced incredibly well and keeps you hooked from the beginning.  Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down.

B0071PS7AC|1.0|I have tried to install this about 15 times now on my Kindle Fire, but it keeps saying &quot;Download complete - tap to launch,&quot; so I tap and it takes me right back to the &quot;install&quot; button, over and over again. It is like &quot;Groundhog Day &quot; on my device...
B0052U59F4|2.0|This is a total ripoff of Twilight. In fact, its Twilight for the adults who were unsatisfied with Bella & Edward's steamy, yet chaste relationship. Here is the breakdown.<br /><br />Main Character: Anastasia / Ana hails from Washington state. Poor self-image, clumsy, never had a real romantic relationship, favors British literature. Divorced parents. Mother lives on the opposite coast, is kind of a dingbat but Ana loves her. Best guy friend (Hispanic instead of Native American) wants to be more than friends.  Old junk car. Bites lip and blushes frequently. Reluctant to accept expensive gifts from the love interest.<br /><br />Love Interest: Christian. Adopted, extremely wealthy, beyond good looking, frequently described with references to Adonis, \\"Michelangelo's David would be jealous\\" & women continually swooning in his presence, Copper hair instead of Bronze, silver/gray eyes instead of gold. Dark, dark secret that Ana can't share with anyone else, serious stalker tendencies, initially warns Ana away \\"I'm no good for you, baby!\\" but then keeps coming around. Adopted siblings, parents are accomplished yet down to earth. \\"Christian has never brought any girls home before.\\" just happens to show up in the nick of time to save Ana from a possible sexual assault, also saves her from being hit by a cyclist due to her clumsiness. Ana's friends are leery of him.<br /><br />Add to that sex, sex, and more sex, spankings and threats of spankings & that's the story. I get a little bored after the 18th graphic sex scene. Ana, an American who has never left the Continental United States, uses British slang & lingo, as do some of her friends on occasion. There are two more books in the series, don't think I care enough to wade through them to find out Christian's other secrets. Can't believe this got a promo on the Today Show and so many 5 star ratings.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|If you're at all familiar with the FaceBook game Cafe World by Zynga, than you will know how to play this game. For those who need neighbors, feel free to add me, my ID is nomnom4u .<br /><br />It's set up in almost the exact same way as Cafe World. You start out with a little restaurant with just a few tables for customers. You have a menu of foods you can make, each taking a different amount of time to prepare. These different prep times let you play the game both while your on your device and also have food cooking in real time while you are not in the game. What I like about these \\"story\\" apps is they are actually more stable than the Zynga games for computers. I currently play this on my Kindle fire and haven't run into a single glitch. There are also no intrusive ads. If you like this app, I highly recommend the Bakery Story app as well.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|My son strongly encouraged me to download this app. I'm glad I did. Interactive search and find, &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; kind of game.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|I think sally's salon is a wonderful game. I think there COULD be some improvements ... first of all,it has almost the same customers all the time. need some new people! And it needs to be more catchy. I mean, it has to be something someone wouldn't get bored of in. but I still think its a really good game.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|As a huge fan of the SHREK series, I knew it was only a matter of time before some spin-offs would ensue. I enjoyed \\"Puss in Boots\\" a lot, largely thanks to Sr. Banderas' smarmy and delightful delivery. Most everything about it was enjoyable, but I missed the manic cleverness that the original SHREK offered, so I wasn't really blown away. Little kids will enjoy it a lot. The original made viewers of all ages pay close attention to the brilliance that was happening in front of them. This one is a pleasant romp, though less clever and focused.<br /><br />Also, the original could be appreciated by all audiences, while this was more kid-oriented. Only my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game play is fun and progresses. nicely as you move into bee tiers of game play of a very robust offering of.over one hundred and twenty games.
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|Director Refn has a following in Europe, and by a legion of American fans who enjoy his slow, angst-ridden style to lead up to some powerful stuff. I can appreciate many things about \\"Drive\\", but, when it was over I sort of wondered if I really cared.<br /><br />I think Ryan Gosling is one of our finest young actors, and he seemed to be channeling his inner suffering (or ambivalence) to copy his performance in \\"Half-Nelson\\", which was actually more nuanced and centered. I'm sorry I wasn't more involved. Carey Mulligan brooded a lot, and the only breath of life I noticed was by the guy who played her husband. Albert Brooks had won a lot of awards for his heartless, nasty mob boss (I'd admired him for many years and was glad to hear he was back on the screen). Well, nothing against Brooks, but his character was written to be one-dimensional and there wasn't really any semblance of who he was, where he came from or where he intended to go. Ron Perlman was effective in his small role.<br /><br />I tried to put together what Refn was trying to do. I didn't think the story was fresh at all, reminiscent of \\"Collateral\\" and the noirish feel of \\"L A Confidential\\", a superb film, seemed to be present. It started abruptly, and ended abruptly, and in between was a little slice of one loser's life. A little adventure along the way, not much.<br /><br />Nasty, mean characters can be immensely entertaining (Hannibal, anyone?) I just wasn't very entertained.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Through thorough world-building, intensive character development, and masterful story-telling, Patrick Rothfuss brings to us the first part of what promises to be an amazing epic.  From the myth within a story within a novel moments that flesh out the ambient cultures encountered in Kwothe's flashback to the brief scenes in the present that allow us to guage the other characters' reactions to the story being told, every part of this book is elegantly designed to delight an active mind.  Kwothe's story will have you obsessed with this new world that Mr. Rothfuss has been kind enough to create for us.  I cannot possibly say enough good things or use enough hyperbolic language to impress upon you how much I think everyone should read this series. !!!!!!!! (There! See?)
B0071PS7AC|2.0|It really is a pretty bad app... it's just unpolished - and the hustler (magazine?) girl certainly doesn't help. (You're right as usual, Superman...)<br /><br />The only good thing I found is that there's an undo button, so you can bowl a 300 while getting extra practice.<br /><br />[Insert inappropriate joke about \\"screwing\\" or \\"cheating\\" the hustler (magazine?) girl here...]
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I read \\"The Name of the Wind\\" and could not wait to start \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\".  Kwothe is an amazingly real, likeable, flawed, conflicted, wonderful character, and I enjoy his adventures in past and present thoroughly.  The magic scheme is brilliant!  The setting is awesome!  The characters are complex and well-developed.  Reading this book might just make you smarter!  I am going crazy waiting for the third book of the trilogy!  Please, Patrick Rothfuss, please give me more!  Here are some more exclamation points!!!!!
B007AMMHSY|5.0|Don't watch a trailer or read reviews - you need to go into this knowing little or nothing to fully appreciate it. I've never seen anything quite like it. If you feel that it's a bit confusing at first, sit back and watch as it peels away the layers of the story and exposes the insanity and tragedy of each piece.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|a good variety of time wasters. don't play it very often. not an addicting game. play for a short time then got bored
B00457WZEI|5.0|When I first started to read this I thought ok this is going to start out in the horse's eyes and then switch.  Well it didn't and I am glad.  The book is well written and I enjoyed reading it very much.  Good book for younger teens.  They should really enjoy this book.
B005ZUR724|5.0|after the update this game works great! worth every cent!! plays really smooth and servers you can<br /> move to if you don't like too meny people. you can buy extra stuff with real money but you really<br /> don't need to you
0807014273|5.0|This book is definitely a must read for everybody. The first part of this book focuses on Frankl's time in the concentration camps, and the second part focuses on his ideas of logotherapy, and you definitely need the first part to really understand the second part. According to Frankl, no matter what situation you are put into, you can choose how to react to it, you end up choosing who you are. Frankl's Logotherapy is based around the idea that everything man does stems from his search for meaning, which I think makes a lot of sense. This is is a book that you must read, whether or not you are interested in psychology. It is a quick read, but you will want to keep reading it again and again.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|good chess app to run and play on the kindle fire. I like the difficult level you can adjust, which is good for beginners.
B000H5TH1Q|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Though not a true horror film in the literal sense, this film does have genuine moments of horror & dread. Beautifully photographed, cleverly edited, an amusing script with a wild story line. Brilliant movie score! My favorite movie of director Brian De Palma! His most Kubrick & Lynch like film, & of course, Alfred Hitchcock. A quasi, \\"Rearview Mirror.\\"<br /><br />A twisted tale of murder & deception, with the moral of the story, don't always believe what you see, & if you see it, don't keep watching, do something about it. A story of a man battling his inner most fears. A story of a man whose voyeuristic tendencies get in the way of his actions, as he becomes obsessed with his beautiful neighbor down the hill, watching her through a telescope. Watching her until...<br /><br />A masterful mystery thriller, that will appeal to not only fans of those genres, but many horror fans to.
B005HEWJVW|4.0|What happens after death?  This mystery of the ages gets a nice Star Trek style twist as Harry Kim explores just that.  It's a memorable episode, and another good stand-alone story.  Watch it if you like Voyager.  4.0/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a very fun time consuming game. me and my kids had a very fun time playing.we recommend it to anyone who loves fun and interesting games!!!!!
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|I had not read anything by William Boyd until now.  What a wonderful novel.  Definitely written in a sensory format and I felt as though with each page I was a participant in the story.  A keeper in the sense I know this is one of those few books I will read multiple times.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Not sure why everyone is having trouble playing? Playing on my Kindle and beat the computer 3 out of the first 5 games I played. Simple and fun.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|If you're a baby boomer or older, then you'd probably remember the blue & yellow plastic vertical frame that would hold red & black \\"checkers\\" or chips. This game app sure brought back some memories!<br /><br />The graphic size & text is easy to view on the Kindle-Fire. Graphics are also sharp & clear with solid, bright colors. There are three modes of play Standard, Christmas & Sport; all with matching Music Themes & the availability to increase difficulty from Easy, Medium, Hard & Expert. In spite of these different modes, the game play has stayed true to it's original format of connecting 4 chips of the same color in a row either, vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Sound & music can be turned off under settings in the Menu.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this app a well deserved 5* Stars!<br />I could not find a single negative to report! It doesn't get much better then this!<br />A Simply Classic game.....done well!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Addicting! Worth the download! I wish points were easier to get and there were more achievements. Will keep working towards unlocking them all.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|this app is really fun and the sound effects are very good.  I downloaded it just minutes ago and played 3 games.  Very entertaining.<br />l
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I liked the book.  I did not fully understand all the concepts in it so while I have read it once, I plan to read it again.  I have for the last year embraced a universal energy and I do try to tap into it when I meditate.  So I already had something of her concept.  I also could relate to a lot of her younger days when my parents made me feel as though I was not important.  I have had cancer three times and seem to have been cured all times.  So I am very lucky but I have looked back on it and because I was trying to be all things to everybody, I think that was the cause of my breast cancer.  I thought that before I read this book.  Since I have had the breast cancer--now 12 years ago, I have been doing a lot of meditation and some things like high blood pressure, seem much better.  Anyhow she comes along and talks about the universal consciousness and it makes sense to me.  For me, the living in the now and fully learning how to love myself will take some learning.  Indeed I plan to read her book again later on this week.  I think my biggest challenge will be to live in the now--probably the most important one also.<br /><br />She has some interesting ideas about the universal consciousness.  One is we can experience several lives simultaneously in sort of a parallel fashion.  Nobody is actually punished in Heaven for our behavior.  We are all one and we receive thoughts from other people.  We understand why they did things we didn't like and we love them. The Key Word is LOVE.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I honestly can't believe this is a free app. I play it more than any other on my Kindle Fire. The design is really attractive. Game play is very fast from the computer -- no waiting!
B005CS3VQ0|4.0|This book ended up on several Best Books of 2011 lists, yet I wonder if every reviewer read past the sexy title and consumed it from end to end. David Bellos is a professional translater (French to English) and has some very interesting and enlightening views on communication and translation. In this book, he doesn't shy away from radical overstatement (such as when he says that nowadays English is the only lingua franca that the various Belgian linguistic communities can still use to communicate with each other). But he is easily forgiven, because he really provides new insight on what a translation is or should be. Unavoidably, this leads to meta-meta-paragraphs about language which can be quite dense at first glance.  Other parts are seriously theoretical (such as the Axiom of Ineffability), which make this book's position on the Best Books list rather surprising, as I doubt that many people are interested in this level of theoretical analysis (I am, so I enjoyed it).
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I really like this book but it has too much hunger games action and too much darkness. I would have liked to have seen Lena spend more time in the Wilds instead of thrown into the darkness of the big city. Lena is a stronger person and you see that development. Raven is a teacher for Lena and had good character development. The two guys were just names or fillers and didn't get much out of them as characters. Julian was one of those characters you wanted to hate, but loved him by the end. The ending of this was a gimme and now we wait for the third book and hope we remember the sequence. The one real twist was a good one. Enjoy!
B0071PS7AC|4.0|the sounds make this game so much fun. it is hard to know where to place the ball, but i am enjoying the game!
B0060Q962Q|1.0|The app requires net access and it is not clear why. There are 4 versions on google for the app. Give or take some features, none require net access except this one. So it can not be for the reason of pausing the game like someone here said or else all the other games (which have no permissions at all) would close when a call comes in, correct? The misinformation here to justify this is unbelievably ignorant random guessing being announced as if it is fact. I noticed the dev took out location permission for this app and all their other apps on amazon. And all the other apps also want net access. Why net access on all the amazon apps and no net required on google versions, except this one?<br /><br />I am not condoning the work of a dev who wants net access for his amazon apps and took it out of their google versions. Plus putting in wanting to know your location on all apps on amazon and google and then taking them all out. Why and what were you doing with that information of wanting to know where we live before you took it out? At what point are you gonna put it back in is the real question. Paid versions dont have ads that need the permission, but the permission in in paid versions too, so whats really up with that?<br /><br />Gonna have to pass on this humongous bloated app by a dev who plays shell games with permissions on both markets that the apps dont even need in order to function!
B0059XTUMC|5.0|As announced today on the \\"Digital Bits\\" web site, this film is scheduled for release on April 24th, 2012. Can't wait to pre-order it when Amazon catches up with the buying public (can you say Magnificent Ambersons...Amazon :(...).<br />Have fun !!!
