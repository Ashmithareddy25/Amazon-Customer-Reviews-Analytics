B008Y7G1BI|5|Kill Bill!
B00JVFZR1M|5|Perfect everything!!!  No complaints!
B00UTJ9C1U|3|It's Okay
B00ATPVA78|5|This game has an excellent story line with a nice variety of tasks.  I was sorry to see it end!
B00005KAQP|5|An older movie but a really good one. Whoopi Goldberg has to hide out from the mob at a convent, a funny premise to begin with. But she finds a way to be useful by leading the choir, which sorely needed help. The church flourishes as a result and has a positive impact on the community. A fun movie to watch.
B00BUCXVPI|5|Good movie, but TC as reacher was a stretch. Should have been the Rock.  But he did well.  They made him look big.
B003O86FMW|5|If you have read the first book in this series, then you are in for another great surprise. This book has many twists and turned that were unexpected and kept my interest throughout. I recommend reading this book along with the rest of the series as it is good for both males and females alike. Def a great and easy read!
B00C33M2EE|3|I was disappointed.  Not nearly as good as the first album! I hope they will do other albums with more appeal.
B000G6R7B8|5|very good
B004J4WKUQ|5|the references to geek pop culture and continuous build of the hunt made for an excellent read. I highly recommend this book.
B00007LTIG|5|I love blues and psychedelic music, and this IS both intertwined with raw interpretation and originality that makes the Dead's sound so unique and transcending of time and style. <br />If you are not a \\"Dead Head\\" but love these two genres, try a listen.   <br />The Greatful Dead is really best live but this studio effort is priceless and the jams are addictive. <br />This one is an essential with either a \\"white-boy\\" blues collection or a 60's collection.  If you're a Dead Head, you already know.
B000AMWIVM|1|(big time spoiler) This is one of those movies that you hear everybody calling it the best horror movie in the long time, but actually suck. This is one of those Blair Witch Project movies that you wait 1  or 2 hours for something to happen but at the end the whole movie goes down the drain. A guy cuts his arm off (and doesn't bleed to death). A very young girl is gagged and the camera insists on her cries and suffering (which is so wrong), and at the end the killer gets away (who by the way didn't have any reasons to do what he did). This movie is so DUMB I couldn't believe my eyes. If you are a horror fan like me, try: Hellraiser (all of them) the entire Nightmare on Elm Street collection, Jaws (1&2), the original Exorcist, the original The Fog, The Ring (1&2) and the Scream trilogy - stay away from SAW; or watch it to see how bad it sucks
B009IEXKXI|5|Simple put: this book is wonderful. It is a must for anyone that enjoy dream with manned missions to Mars. Clear and well crafted, this book show us what the life can be on such extreme situation. In the same line of Mars Trilogy (Kim Stanley Robinson, 2009) here the author spare a long time in details about the technology and science background required to bring credibility to his adventure.<br /><br />Been a sci-fi story, one cannot expect too much about complex character development and this book not provide it. Mark Watney is a eternal calm, logical, well trained astronaut that always do what he need to do without fall in despair or stress even when he is left alone in Mars for about two years. However good sci-fi (good hard sci-fi in fact) is all about credible science foundation and not too much about anything else. In this regard The Martian is without doubt a very good hard-like-rock sci-fi story.
B00H83EUQW|1|Made a mistake ordering this DVD.  I normally collect DVD's from the Oscars that have won.  This one won Best Director, and Best Cinematography.  REALLY?  The Cinematography was all CG... so I think that's bogus.  The acting was worse than a B movie, and the plot had so many holes it makes swiss cheese look like the Berlin wall.  Also, the odds of stuff like that happening is like the odds of shooting a gun at 100 yards and hitting a piece of paper on the flat edge.  Like my daughter said,  &#34;Went to see the show, fell asleep when they were floating in space, woke up at the end, and they are still floating in space.... *yaawwwwwnnnnn*......
B0001EKZOQ|5|I would like to have in CD the BLANCO Y NEGRO Concert in live, that was base for this production
B000YDI9UG|5|I bought these Timberland boots for my 16 year old son as a Christmas gift and he/I absolutely love them. They look great with straight leg or skinny jeans inside the boots or with khaki pants covering the top of the boots. Very versitile and very comfortable per my 16 year old son.
B00881VLCE|5|This application is really high quality for being free.  I recommend it to anyone.  I like the adjustable piece size.
B00H58VGIA|4|A heartbreaking, yet inspiring story about slavery, friendship and the battles all women must overcome.<br />The brutal treatment of the slaves was upsetting, as well it should be, so I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a &#34;lite read&#34;. The story and the characters will remain with you long after you finish the book.
B0042RJWTC|5|Very good shape, love the movies.
1400067936|4|Taleb points out some of the systematic errors in human expectations of future events and the general nature of random processes. His writing style is not my favorite, he chooses it put in a great deal of his own personality which at times makes it somewhat unclear. He has a few points to get across but uses 250 pages to do so; a bullet point version could sum it up in a few pages. But the stories included make it more memorable and it is a fairly enjoyable read, so I would still recommend it.
B00K7C17QW|5|I have a good time playing this game. The energy should recharge more quickly and it should not charge so much to investigate the scenes.
B0030B621W|5|It takes a bit of time, but it's worth it. A great film, and a fantastic job by Sam Rockwell.
B00CL68BK2|5|Had no desire to see this, but the wife made me watch it and I can only say it was awesome and hilarious.  The acting was incredible and witty.  Very nice story, I'm glad I watched it.
B005CRQ4GU|5|I love this book because it is based on a kid who is special, it is a great book and I did not know that even though my whole school talked about it an tell I read it and saw the movie!!!  All ages should read this book .
B0054JZC6E|3|This is ok for a quick something to do.  Some games are cheesy, but those can be the most fun.
B00000DR5I|5|This album must be listened to in the dark. Pitch black. Seriously.  You don't want to be distracted, because this music can do stuff to you.  It has to me.  It is, to me, the audio equivalent of an 0rg@$m.  The cover on it is another description of the music.  Sublime.<br /><br />While this album is only 30 years old (unlike classical music which is obviously older), I seriously feel that, like classical music, this stuff can give off so many emotions like classical music, it's expressive without a hint of lyrics, can take you places, and requires your full attention.  Like one of the other reviewers, my hats off to you if you can describe the music in words.  This stuff can do a lot of images.  Heck, I'm just anaylzing it like crazy here.  And for those of you who want something emotional out of music (not just something for psuedo music fans that tickle their fancy dissecting technical music), it's here.  All those expressiveness and places will bring up emotion, although it's sublime.  Heck, get this album yourself and listen to it.  I look forward listening to this album...again!<br /><br />Before I wrap this up, I want to address some of these people calling this not music.  It's easy to say that because it just doesn't have a beat or isn't structured like a song by Kiss, the Eagles, etc.  It brings up emotion, it relies on the sequence of sounds to make something with a bit of repition, it has a structure, it has melody, texture, and timbre.  It's a collection of organized sounds and you get something by letting it consume you and basking, thinking, feeling emotions.  For the people who intend using this as backround music for reading or some other stupid ______, I'm sorry, but those people are missing something.  THis isn't backround music, it requires attention, and you people should put the ________ book away and turn off the light, and let this music do something to you.<br /><br />Hopefully somedays, people will figure out more about these guys.  Despite that this music demands attention and lacks any convential melodies like the disposable _____ today, even the MTV fanatic tween (hey they have feelings too!) could get something out of this.  Dammnit, if those people had an attention span, they could even get something out of this.  Seriously.  If you don't have a soul, than yes, you really will not like this at all.  But that will never happen, so there's no excuse for anybody for not giving this a try.  Create your own world inside Rubycon.<br /><br />10/10ds attention and lacks any convential melodies like the disposable _____ today, even the MTV fanatic tween (hey they have feelings too!) could get something out of this.

B001QOGYFY|4|You know it's not Gone With The Wind.  That being said, it's a solid albeit slightly predictable thriller that is actually a good bit of fun.  They do a great job personifying the weather, although at times it can be a bit overboard.  At a $10 price point it's a good buy, if you can get it on a lightning deal or cheaper it's even better,
B0071XO8RA|5|Immersive, suspenseful, heart-breaking, funny, brilliant. Even though there are thousands of reviews here on Amazon alone, try your best to go in cold on this astounding story. A remarkable book by a self-published author at a great price. Stop reading reviews and start reading this book.
B00000I14Z|5|smooth, talented, relaxing, impressive, I can go on and on. A MUST for every collection. Charles has it going on!
B009ZQC7MY|5|We've just jumped on the Downton Abbey train and are playing catch up to be ready for Season 4.  Great show and series.
B00CATSONE|5|This is a fascinating look at the life of one of the finest creative minds in history.  Edison may have over shadowed him, however his work was stellar and may have been appropriated in Edison's inventions as I have heard he was not a nice person.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|The story kept me captivated. John Grisham's storytelling can add mystery to anything. A story about a contested will that incorporates issues such as racism and greed is a true page turner.
B00HXYKYIE|2|An excellent description of the habits and lives of elephants in the wild .  The  discussion of psychic  phenomena and much of the rest of the story is difficult to follow and understand.
1452242569|4|Simply put, if you are going to do a case study based dissertation then you MUST site Yin, he is poosibly the definitive expert on case study.
B008OOYALE|5|this is one of the best games that I have ever played on my kindle and I would recommend this game to anyone under the age of 20
B0020BUWX2|5|One of the BEST books I have ever read.  Well written, great story & my only complaint was it ended too soon!  Sequel?
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Season three was amazing although the ending made me cry uncontrollably. But that's the sign of a good series that makes me laugh and cry.
B00CSR2J9I|4|This is the first game I got and so far it is still the best. Can not wait to keep playing. Thanks for the app.
B00APJLFEG|3|Kinda cute, but I'm glad I rented instead of buying.  I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. I don't dislike him, but I find some of his characters annoying.  His character wasn't too bad in this movie, but I did find his accent somewhat irritating.  I do think the movie could've been better than it was, but it wasn't bad.
B007J4T2G8|1|Terrible writing, terrible plot, terrible everything.  I'm amazed that this is doing so well.  Plenty of erotic fiction out there, why this one is on top is a mystery.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.  Rent a decent adult film
B009UX2YAC|4|it is a great game but it stopped updating after the Tokyo update but other than that it is a pretty good game.
0066214122|3|I have always liked Crichton and his work, but I was disappointed in Prey. He is either churing out the books too fast just for the money, or he thinks his readers are stupid. Most people familiar with Crichton are intelligent enough to understand - in a layman's way - the science behind his work. Otherwise we wouldn't pick up his books. But in Prey he spends too much time explaining the science and technology, which isn't that new. Scientists and other writers have been talking about and writing about nanotechnology for a long time. Even old Star Trek fans will recognize the plot idea of nanos-gone-wild.<br />I had this book figured out from about chapter two, but pushed through it to see if I were wrong - but I wasn't - very boring.<br />However, if you have a teenager in the house who likes science fiction, then he/she should like this. I used a basic formula and found the reading level to be about grade 11-12, so a wide and novice-science audience would like this book.<br />I hope that Mr. Crichton gets back to some serious writing in the near future and actually produces something that challenges us.
B00957T6X6|3|I ordered the books because I very much enjoyed the TV series but was not always clear who was who.  The books are too long and go<br />into too much detail.  Do I really want to know what they ate in 70 some courses at the king's wedding dinner?  I still get confused with the multitude of families and individuals despite a detailed list of each family's members, their spouses, off-spring and assorted other members of their group/castle/army.  There are hundreds which makes it difficult  to go back and check on the relationships.  On the positive side the books are well written and many chapters are exciting and fascinating.  I just wish the author were less detail oriented and got on with the<br />story.  In about half the pages we would have a great, exciting story!
B005GHN2GG|5|One of the biggest surprises this year was how much I loved this book to the last page, as I'm not really into PNR.  The love story was sweet and engaging, and the world of magic was (no pun intended) absolutely enchanting.  I'm a romance reader, and as such, have high standards for a love story, and ever hopeful the love scenes are well place, paced, and meaningful to the overall plot.  Master of Crows delivered.  Fantastic characters.  Great fun read.  A new fave!
0446310786|5|this is the best book i have ever read for school, and one of the best i've ever read for enjoyment
0811879542|5|This book is so much fun not only for kids, but for grown ups!  It is very interactive and really lets your imagination work!
B00HI0R80A|5|if you liked season 1, you'll really like season 2 as well, especially if you're a fan of snarky logan and ridiculous dick.  the main mystery is a bit less cohesive than in season 1 but whatever, you're still enjoying every second of it anyway.
B004GHNIRK|1|A perfectly good story is buried in hundreds of pages of tangents.  I have never skimmed so much and missed so little.
B002U5HKZ6|5|I couldn't be more pleased with this novel. It was on  of the best books I have ever read. My heart is touched by the beautiful tale Roberts so eloquently and cleverly put together. The hear  An  love of India is in this book. I only wish there were a thousand more pages to read.
B00992CF6W|3|I want this game but I want it to be cheaper like 3 bucks or something but I love minecraft its cool
014242417X|5|I feel like John Green writes for young adults, however I really loved this book
B00000K19E|5|I simply do not know where to begin; however, I will do as best I can.<br />When the movie was released the Wednesday prior to Easter, I knew something was up.  I mean, my exposure to Matrix equations in undergrad led  me to sense &quot;balls to bones,&quot; that this was a must see.  Therefore, I set out to see the movie when I left my office.  Upon my  arrival, the theatre was not as full as I anticipated; yet upon settling  in, it got a little fuller, and I was ready for anything.  Boy did I get  it.  When the movie was over, I sat there in awe.  I peeled myself from my  seat to leave.  Having done so, I, once outside of the theatre, decided to  see it again; that evening.  I have seen it so much, my colleges are  suggesting that I have a &quot;problem.&quot;  I reply, that seeking  knowledge, and its accompanying behavior has, for millennia, been regarded  as &quot;weird.&quot;<br />This movie is crammed with many levels of  information that I, like Morpheus, tell others &quot;The Matrix, no one can  tell you what it is.  You have to see it for yourself.&quot;<br />By far, this  movie is a thinking person's movie.  In that it deals with juxtaposing our  world as we &quot;know&quot; it with the created world of &quot;The  Matrix.&quot;  In other words, we create the reality, collectively and  individually, we experience at any given moment.  Be it our clothes,  careers, institutions, constructs, or places of residence.  We create it  all.  It is the proverbial &quot;dream world.&quot;<br />I am choosing my  words carefully in an effort not to give the movie away.  Yet, I must say  if you are looking for an understanding of the world around you, please  see/buy this movie.  Please remember, everything in this movie has a  meaning; EVERYTHING.  Its philosophical, theological, sociological, and  esoteric messages will cause you to become not unlike myself, a walking  question mark.  Let your journey begin.<br />Travel in peace.
B003XRELGQ|4|He is, without a doubt A BRILLIANT writer.  Normally more inspiring and not as cynical about our human condition here he still inspires thought, something most writers can only aspire to do.  Cats cradle brings the best and worst of man's most important obsessions religion and science, together and through an original story highlights the best and worst of each.  I loved it, again.
0670021652|3|I was very curious to see how Elizabeth Gilbert, our bohemian, man-loving, commitment-fearing, young woman would take to marriage to her beloved Felipe. I rather enjoyed her therapeutic trek following her divorce and ill-fated affair as chronicled in Eat Pray Love and wanted more. Just how did life with Felipe work out after they finally got out of bed and faced up to reality? Well, I was disappointed!  She offered us a few tasty morsels of real life with Felipe--Homeland Security's quest to deport the undocumented Felipe stressed them both out, traveling with Felipe showed us some of the reality of relationships (I enjoyed their bus ride), and some of her discussions with Felipe were enlightening. I liked Felipe's humble admissions regarding money and booze (he has always been good at making money but not at saving it and he drinks too much wine). Now this is a dose of reality (from her personal life). But I stress these were moments in a much larger view of marriage--the anthropologist's or the feminist's look at marriage encompassed most of the book and I found it to be draining and depressing for the most part.   Her basic premise is that marriage is not what it's cracked up to be and it's worse for women. She has plenty of recent interviews and historical information to back her up. But it's mind-numbing. I'm a widow. When I was married, it could be heaven, it could be hell--most spouses have said the words, \\"I could kill you!\\" But I used to love to read Judith Viorist's book Marriage is Better (I think it was called) because it emphasized the fact that you can want to kill him one day and the next day you're so glad that you didn't!  Had I picked up Gilbert's book Committed on a bad day, I would have ended up more depressed because she manages to find a multitude of negative information about marriage. For example, supposedly during the Great Depression when poverty-stricken spouses were unhappy they carved out their own separations by splitting their houses into two with bed sheets. This is to show us that when people say that in the olden days divorce was rare and people stayed in love forever that this was just a facade. Maybe so for some people. I recently saw an article in the paper about a couple who had been married for seventy years and were still in love and helping one another through the trials and tribulations of old age. This is the sort of thing that makes you feel good about the power of human love.    I suppose some people might feel that Gilbert's cautionary tale will teach them about what they are getting into when they say \\"I do.\\" But this book isn't an upper. It's basically a downer because she paints such a sad picture of the institution of marriage.   Granted, she says that Felipe tells her that they're free-thinking enough to craft their own kind of marriage. And she's hoping that this is true (but still feels that they could end up divorced). Maybe some would say that she is a realist. But all this doom and gloom makes for a tiresome read. I'm giving it three stars because I still say that she knows how to write. But then no one would deny that Shakespeare could write either, and yet he was a master of doom and gloom himself.
B0000VCZKW|5|One of Roald Dahl's best books make for one of our family's favorite movies! This was a hit with our kids ages 3-9. A nice, low priced DVD tht's worth 3 times it's price in fun. This also has Closed Captioning, a Must-Have for our family with a Deaf child that's not always included on these lesser known older films when they're put on DVD. Add this one to your collection today!
B002APU580|5|Love love love this movie
030771652X|2|somewhat thrilling, but the last 30 pages ruined this book for me.<br />the \\"twist\\" is a very unsatisfactory one, none of it let's you assume lupton's a great author. also the story becomes very foreseeable towards the end.<br />makes me not want to read anything else from her.
B00DV2D0JC|5|one of the nicest adventure app game I have played.  lovely music and immersive sound track.  artwork was top notch even down to the hidden objects.  story was detailed and intriguing.  puzzles ranged from easy to advanced but none were real stumpers.  the HO puzzles were not obtrusive and made sense as far as the objects in them.  map pointed to areas to give clues as to where you needed to be to progress which cut down on backtacking common to these types of games.  option to skip puzzles is a plus for those impatient.  the only comments I have was that the voice acting of the female lead and children could have been better.<br />a welcome refreshing change was having a female lead to the game who saves the day. very well done!<br />all in all an excellent game and well worth the cost.  replayable due to achievement goals.  has some requests to rate but not obtrusive.  lots of links to other apps but confined to main menu.<br /><br />will play other games from this dev
B005TPCQ5I|1|Got it into my head this would be a Before Sunrise kind of deal, but it wasn't.  It was unremittingly awful. The male character was detestable for 16 of the 18 years of this movie and the one day a year conceit got tired around 1992.
B0000AXE8I|4|The Matrix Reloaded is probably one of the finest jobs of using computer animation along with a movie. The car chase scene on Highway 101 is perhaps in the top three only to Bullitt and the Seven Ups. Interestingly, Agent Smith becomes a computer virus which replicates himself to kill Neo. A scene in the movie involves Neo trying to fend off about a hundred Agent Smiths. The potholes of the sequel are the following.<BR>1. The movie is more predictable than the last.<BR>2. Neo flying just sets a lousy vibe throughout the movie.<BR>3. The idea of a backdoor is corney.<BR>Besides that, this is a solid four star movie. If you enjoy sci-fi thrillers or enjoy big car chase movies, I would definitely buy the Matrix Reloaded on DVD. Buying the VHS would be a waste of the tremendous special effects throughout the movie.
B007EG9GQM|5|Amazing Album!! Can't wait until they release there next album! Great job One Direction, can't wait! Love how all the songs on here are not available on any other cd! Now I have some that I have never heard before!
B000VR824S|5|I bought this DVD for my husband who loves guitar music. A friend told him he should buy it and we weren't disappointed. It is truly an awesome listening experience. All the bands on this are truly some of the greatest around, and B.B. King is the best. If you love guitar rock and blues this is truly a must buy item. I have just purchased the 2004 DVD but haven't had a chance to listen to it yet. Can't wait until we get the time. Extremely fantastic viewing and listening.
B00OICLVBI|5|I've been married 25 Years and I feel like I experienced an epiphany. I've been trying to speak MY love language to my spouse for years and it's not been reciprocated. I hope I can get her to read this with me. I think our marriage has been great for 25 years yet I still have great excitement for our rediscovery.
B00BR9WB1Y|5|great!
B001M0HGR2|5|Husband and grandsons liked it
B000V801PK|5|It is certainly heartening to know that any day Annie Lennox decides to step into the recording studio, she'll be able to delight her fans and the world with her words and melody.<br /><br />Dark Road opens with its sunken melancholic before breaking into a rapturous bridge then closing with the quiet calm it began with. Such is a display of the multitudes of emotion Lennox is capable of packing in. On songs like Womankind and the archetypical anti-HIV/AIDS tribute, Lennox attempts to sing about female empowerment and knowledge, resulting in two gorgeous anthems. The latter, ambitiously includes the backing vocals of 23 female artists and a resounding sign-off that features a short African interlude. On other tracks (Big Sky, Lost), Lennox touches on love, loss, and hurt like no one else ever knew.<br /><br />At her most experimental, Lennox shows her mastery. Through the Glass Darkly (probably inspired by Jostein Gaarder) begins like a piece of Zero 7 while Coloured Bedspread is a damn fine electronic synth track destined for the clubs.<br /><br />Of course, Lennox's deep haunting voice is never compromised throughout the album.<br /><br />If there's one album (along with Feist's The Reminder and Radiohead's In Rainbow) you have to listen to in 2007, Songs of Mass Destruction is the one that serves to add some soul into music.<br /><br />The Deluxe edition includes extensive commentary of each song by Lennox herself as well as the video for Dark Road. If you get the Barnes and Noble exclusive edition, there's two bonus tracks - the acoustic version of Dark Road which features an entirely different arrangement to the original and Don't Take Me Down. Worth the money for fans.(A)
B007PT3QOQ|5|Takes me back to playing the original on that old Apple. This is so much better though. Wondering how I can get my family to work the farm too
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is the coolest  the part that was hard was the victor battle<br />But then later I got the hang of it but I wonder if there is a ending to the game I like how it shows pics frome the movie.
B007IXWKUK|5|I love the book....so good u can't put it down.  I couldn't wait to finish boom two to move on to book three.  And having an Amazon account makes everything easy.
B0054JZC6E|5|This game is fun. It is really fun because it is fun. It is also very fun. P.S. it is very fun.
B009U9S6FI|4|A book everyone should read.
B000059XYK|4|Is the remake of &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; a masterpiece? No. Is it better than the original? Debatable, to say the least. One thing is for sure, this film has been unfairly sliced and diced by blood thirsty critics, and it did not deserve that. &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; is indeed a very witty, smart, sexy (Angelina Jolie is in it, isn't she?), Buckheimer film. One thing though, like other reviewers here have said, this is a devout car film, and viewers who don't really care much about cars might spend a lot of time during the movie rolling their eyes. But, for all the car lovers out there, at least try renting it, huh?
B00I6JOD2S|5|This movie is so cute and funny.  I liked it a lot from the first viewing.  My kids like it even more and watch it all the time.  As in, every day.<br /><br />It has a similar sort of feel as Wreck it Ralph.  It's a little more humerous but overall not quite as good in my opinion.  If you liked Wreck it Ralph, you will also like this.<br /><br />Scratch that.  I think pretty much everyone will like this.
B0000584V3|5|Mixing acoustic folk, progressive rock, and death metal might seem difficult to pull off with class and panache, but this is just everyday work for a band like Opeth. Amazing riffs, wonderful vocals (both the brutal death growls and melodic singing passages), and skillful composition make this album simply one of the best albums ever. If you value great music, get this!!!
B00TKLOII0|5|Another Great motorcycle Doc.
B004Q1FDHO|1|I completely agree with the top review dating back a few months ago, and I don't think anything has changed for the better. Personally, I was disappointed as soon as I loaded this game for the first time, and found the display sort of like covered by a haze with washed-out colours &amp; all; a quick game left me hanging after I killed all the fish but the game knew neither to quit nor told me what to do next; tried the menu buttons &amp; it died on me... I won't bore you, so please read the other more detailed &amp; objective reviews. I have Ridiculous Fishing which I strongly suspect inspired (to put it kindly) this game, but it's both better &amp; cheaper. For 5 bucks that this game asks for, I'd run to get a refund...
B00847KFDS|5|Once upon a time every Creedence album(yeah, before there even were CD's) was ripped by Rolling Stone Magazine.  I have to say I mostly agreed with the criticism.  All the songs sounded somewhat the same.  Gradually, however, Creedence or should I say John Fogerty, since he was Creedence, does grow on you.  Now when you take some of these songs and add new singers and arrangements--well it is pretty darn good.  Rock-On John Fogerty!!
B00RY86HSU|5|great movie
B009UX2YAC|5|I got this game a long time ago and I love it. I especially like how subway surfers goes on a world tour and u can try to get new things! It's entertaining with totally different characters AND boards. I would recommend S.S.  to pretty much everyone. I'm not a skilled critic but I don't think there's any decent complaints except the ads. They're kind of annoying but otherwise u should get the game. And plus- I got one of the games from the ads! They're not that bad! :) anyway you can play this game on the go or at home. It's pretty dope.
B007SGM084|1|You don't need to waste your time on this trilogy.  Just imagine these words repeated thousands of times and you pretty much have the book:<br /><br />gasp<br /><br />blush<br /><br />flush<br /><br />smirk<br /><br />roll my eyes<br /><br />\\"stop biting your lip\\"<br /><br />bemused<br /><br />control freak<br /><br />raises an eyebrow<br /><br />Holy crap, holy cow, holy ____, holy ____, holy ____, etc...<br /><br />mouth twists<br /><br />squirm<br /><br />crap<br /><br />double crap<br /><br />gape<br /><br />\\"Oh my...\\"<br /><br />mercurial<br /><br />So repetitive, redundant, tedious, tiresome, and downright boring (see what a thesaurus can do for you!), I had to force myself to finish it just to see if it had ANY redeeming qualities. *(Spoiler! It didn't!)*
0736430512|2|Some of the words are not suited for book reading to kids
B000WTNCQS|4|So...  Just like 20yrs, 8mos ago, I was standing in front of the local CD retailer to be the first to pick up The Joshua Tree.  I succeeded yet again.  :-)    Being the looney that I am, I bought the \\"one-up your friends\\" version with the DVD and the book.  I've had a little time with each of the above, and I thought I'd share my findings with those who WEREN'T the first in line to grab the 20th Anniv. Ed.    The first CD, the reissue of the original material, is what you're REALLY buying this for, of course.  I haven't listened to every second of the CD yet, but after listening to about 20mins of it (pieces of every song), it definitely is an improvement over the original release.  Whereas the 1987 release sounded murky and muddy, with poorly-defined bass being its worst \\"feature\\", the new one is noticeably clearer.  It won't knock your socks off, but they did clean it up.  It also plays a little bit louder than the original, but not massively so.    The best feature of disc 1?  They no longer have the end of \\"One Tree Hill\\" cut off and tacked onto the beginning of \\"Exit\\"...  The chapter break (or whatever you call it) is now in the right place.  I don't know if later pressings of The Joshua Tree had this problem, but my first-run copy did (and does).    The second disc is mostly material that we've seen before, either as b-sides or in the singles collection of a few years back.  Only the last five tracks are \\"new\\", or at least new in the sense that you probably haven't heard them before unless you're a fanatic.  I'm not going to review these songs, or indeed the rest of the audio, since if you're interested in buying this set you probably don't care if the add'l material is any good, now do you?    The DVD, however, could affect your decision about whether or not to buy this set instead of the audio-only set.  To the contrary of the logo on the back of the box, the video material is NOT in Dolby Digital.  I thought that I'd made a mistake with the setup of my player, but after switching back and forth between a couple of other discs, I can only conclude that this is in fact NOT in surround sound.    The concert on the disc is a good show, near as I can tell after a half-hour of watching.  It's shot on video (in 4:3, like all the video on the disc) and is filmed at least partially at night, so there are occasional instances where the stage lights \\"smear\\" as the camera pans across them, but it's nowhere NEAR as bad as the Red Rocks show (which I bet we'll NEVER see on DVD).  It's interesting to finally have an official video from the era that's not \\"Rattle and Hum\\", and the performance of the band at the peak of its powers is quite engaging.    The two music videos are interesting but, again, nothing earth-shattering.  The alternate video of \\"With or Without You\\" isn't a giant departure from the one we're all familiar with, but I will say I'm glad they didn't use that one.  The video for \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" is presently up on YouTube so you can take a gander and decide whether or not you think it's something you MUST have.    The documentary is pretty cool (again, from what I've seen of it).  It even includes video of the shooting of the now-famous Time Magazine cover, among other things.  I think this and the concert make the DVD worthwhile.    Also in the box is the hardback book and a few photos.  The pictures are Anton Corbijn shots that are printed on heavy paper stock and sheathed in a cardboard envelope.  They're \\"suitable for printing\\", as they say, but I'll probably just leave them in the box.  The hardback book contains pieces written by several of the gents responsible for the original record, some more photos, the lyrics to all the songs, and several pages of credits at the end.  A nice piece that I haven't read every page of yet, but I will definitely set aside a half hour to pore through it.    So there you have it.  I'm giving this four stars instead of five because of the decision to not mix the audio for the DVD into Dolby Digital or DTS.  Another reason for the 4 stars is that I feel the remastering could've been a little more impressive...  It should've been in the SACD or the DVD-A format, for instance, and a little more time could have been taken to make it even clearer-sounding.    I'm sure that Island will happily produce a hi-res audio version of this at a later time and I can buy The Joshua Tree AGAIN.
0399226907|5|My son loves this book!
B00BEIYN3M|2|Wasn't that good of a movie compared to the hype it received.  I would not recommend buying this movie, rent it instead.
B00GLP84AQ|5|Outstanding Movie and even better in Blu-Ray
B000WAEJZ0|5|I've been wanting a Whitney Houston CD for some time now, and I looked through all of the ones on Amazon, and this one had a lot of songs that I like.  I love it!  Great CD!  I have had a little trouble playing it sometimes on my car CD player, but I'm pretty sure it's my car CD player.
B006BGZJJ4|5|An essential spare part for a Kindle fire.  Before some wiseacre mentions it, of course there are generics out there and they are cheaper and many of them actually work. As a general rule, I believe you get what you pay for. If you load your vehicle with the cheapest spark plugs, plug wires, filters, gas, oil etc. that you can find, that all adds up and the best vehicle out there will run like a Yugo with a bullet through the block. If you spend $200.00 on a Kindle Fire, why risk damaging the ports or otherwise screwing up something valuable just so you can post online about how brilliant you are?
B000RZIGVS|1|This set has episodes and whole discs that are totally corrupted, others have some or most of the episode intact and then you run into chugging, garbled, distorted sections that once again ruin the experience. This is a bad set, the packaging is unnacceptable, and I couldn't be more displeased with the product save that when they did play it looked great but its no consolation. Stay away from this product.
B008CPZNL6|5|Beautiful aggregator interface with lots of flexibility and an increasingly sophisticated social component. Very nice presentation on the Kindle screen.
B00947N6UG|5|This movie has a heart warming story that's appropriate for all ages. There is some fight scenes where each character uses their powers according to the holiday they take care of or related to their name. I chose to purchase this movie because I saw it in theaters and loved it.
B00006CXXU|5|Although many mock the fact that Christina Aguilera dresses trashy, no one can deny this girl has one of the best voices of this generation. She has great vocal ranges, and I love the fact that on her \\"Stripped\\" CD she has dance songs, ballads, and r&b/rock tunes and can beat out any other diva in a heart beat. I am personally not a big fan of Christina but this CD is definitely one of her greatest yet. Let her dress how she wants, let her love life run it's course neither of those should over run our opinion on her talent. It's strange that people would \\"hate\\" this CD and start mentioning how she dresses, which has nothing to do with her music...only her life which -- is none of our business. I believe that \\"Walk Away\\" was her strongest vocal performance on this album and by far the best song but not far from it would have to be \\"Beautiful\\", thats just my two cents. We just need to getover watching these celebrites and just listen to the CD's.
B00QW8TYWO|5|My 5 year old triplet grandkids love it, and play it every time they come to &#34;Mimi and Papa's house&#34;...my 7 year old has it downloaded on her &#34;Nobby&#34; and she loves it too...I haven't played myself, but if it keeps them entertained, then it is a good game. It reminds me of the arcade game &#34;Frogger&#34;.
B00AA0TJO8|5|its awsome i got  it for free but i cant get past one level you should get this game (:
B004YW4L5K|5|Loved everything about this book - characters, development, contrasts, story line.  Neil Gaiman at his finest. Probably one of his best works.  Made up for The Ocean at the End of the Lane.
B005723JSQ|5|I loved this book. Charming story with today's electronic world shortcomings.  Can actually see some of my younger colleagues in the story.
B00RW1J8RG|1|Garbage!!!
B000MKD9P6|4|This is a realistic portrayal of high fashion.  Perhaps a bit more.  It looks a little puffed-up to me.  In any case I would recommend a look especially if you like fashion.  Has nice story as well.
B0000683DH|5|This movie will go down in history as the all time best Trek movie ever made. Khan is the all time greatest villan ever, his onscreen presence is magnificant. Highly recommended.
B00M8NMN3E|5|Yes I know fellow ELP fans, \\"the best\\" is subjective, but my opinion. Following in the footsteps of their first two studio albums, [[ASIN:B007Q4Y9I2 EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER]] and [[ASIN:B00PUTCEZA TARKUS]], TRILOGY gets the Deluxe Edition makeover, with a new remaster of the original Greg Lake production and new stereo and 5.1 Surround Sound mixes from Jakko M. Jakszyk. For those unfamiliar with Mr. Jakszyk, he is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, solo artist and record producer. He is also currently the lead singer and second guitarist in [[ASIN:B00QJH5O9K KING CRIMSON]]. He had also worked with former KC members in the [[ASIN:B003WKFAEG 21st CENTURY SCHIZOID BAND]]. Jakko has had a long and varied career, check him out! Anyhoo, he was passed the reins from former mixmaster Steven Wilson of PORCUPINE TREE, another great musician with a busy and varied career who did the honors for the first two. Mr. Wilson has also remixed a slew of classic progressive-rock albums from the catalogs of KING CRIMSON, [[ASIN:B004TPXVKS CARAVAN]], JETHRO TULL, [[ASIN:B00IS3EASY YES]] and XTC, to name a few......<br /><br />EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER's first four studio albums are undisputed classics of the progressive-rock genre. It's hard to judge which is the best, if you even have to go that route. The first album (#18 US, #4 UK) was full of ideas bursting to get out of Keith Emerson's swirling overloaded auditory cortex and was their most \\"stripped-down\\" release. TARKUS (#9 US, #1 UK) ups the ante with the band's use of the best musical electronics of it's day. The side-long \\"Tarkus\\" suite is one of the most dazzling and tightly constructed progressive epics of it's era, but the rest of the album contained too-much filler, although filler some bands would kill for. BRAIN SALAD SURGERY (#11 US, #2 UK), their fourth, is probably their most well-known and feted release. Often near or at the top of most \\"best of prog-rock\\" lists, it had previously been available in a 5.1 mix on [[ASIN:B0000507R0 DVD-A]] and [[ASIN:B0017M8XS6 SACD]], with mixed reviews. There's a [[ASIN:B00M3C579M 2014 Super Deluxe Edition]] with a 5.1 DVD but is prohibitively expensive for most. It was supposed to be included in the 2CD+DVD Deluxe Edition but was pulled at the last minute, leaving only a High-Res Stereo version. Needless to say, fans are not happy. While side-and-a half long epic \\"Karn Evil 9\\" is an enjoyable long-form composition, their stately remake of the old hymn \\"Jerusalem\\" leaves me cold, while \\"Benny The Bouncer\\" is one novelty too many. That leaves \\"Toccata,\\" an impressive exercise in the then new technologies and probably the album's best cut, and \\"Still...You Turn Me On,\\" the requisite Greg Lake ballad, not a bad little ditty, but it pales compared to \\"Lucky Man\\" (#48 US) and \\"From The Beginning\\" (#39 US)......<br /><br />TRILOGY (#5 US, #2 UK) begins with \\"The Endless Enigma\\" a two-part composition with Emerson's \\"Fugue\\" sandwiched between. The (yes) enigmatic opening, with it's pulsing heartbeat bass (read the liner notes), eerie synths, punctuating bongos and stabs of free-form piano gives way to one of their most \\"classical\\" melodies and stately choruses. \\"Fugue\\" is basically Emerson rearranging the songs melodies into, yes, a fugue. Tubular bells and a clarion synth announces Part Two's rousing climax. The more I hear \\"From The Beginning\\" the more I like it. Pleasing open string guitar chords  one of Lake's best melodies. Emerson's synth may closely resemble his work on \\"Lucky Man\\" but at least he keeps it more concise. A not-to-different alternate take is included as a bonus. \\"The Sheriff\\" comes off like a second cousin to THE BEATLES' \\"Bungalow Bill\\" but is much less annoying. Keith gets his honky-tonk fixation on as a coda. The original Side Two leads off with the band's all too short arrangement of [[ASIN:B000003F5S Aaron Copeland]]'s \\"Hoedown.\\" Emerson's majestic synths ride over Palmer's galloping drums and one of Lake's most powerful(and Squire-like) bass-lines. The 5.1 mix is awesome. The title-tune follows with Emerson setting the scene for it's main theme, about three-minutes in all hell breaks loose and the band goes double-time. Palmer doesn't get enough credit for his complex percussion foundation, reminiscent of John Bonham's work on LED ZEP's \\"Four Sticks.\\" While probably the weakest track, \\"Living Sin\\" is redeemed by Keith's stunning Hammond work, which dominates the song and makes you forget the silly lyrics. The band couldn't wish for a better finale than Emerson's tour de force Ravel tribute \\"Abaddon's Bolero.\\" The composition was made for 5.1 , revealing layers upon layers. The swirling synth fanfares and Palmer's gradually intensifying tom-toms bring the track, and the album, to a grand finish.......<br /><br />While you can argue over whether this is their best work, you cannot deny it's one of their finest, and IMHO their most consistent. While the original and new stereo mixes are fine, it's the 5.1 surround that takes the honors, I'll be looking forward to more of Jakko Jaksyzk's work in this area.

B00006JJ1O|5|This is my personal opinion about the quality of this album, which is more POP ROCK than the Russian album which is more DANCE POP:<br />1. Not gonna get us: If you like Pop, Rock and \\"THE MATRIX SOUNDTRACK\\" kind of songs, then this one may be your favourite. The song tell us a story about a forbidden love, and how the 2 girls will continue with it, doesn´t matter what can happen, \\"They are not gonna get us!!\\" Really good one. 9 of 10. <br />2. All the things she said: The main reason to buy this album, the best song in it. One of my best songs ever TOP TEN. The best one. 10 of 10. <br />3. Show me Love: It starts with a phone call, in Russian, then with a slow and soft beginning charms you, it continues with one of the coolest chorus ever heard: \\"SHOW ME LOVE, SHOW ME LOVE, TIL I OPEN THE DOOR, SHOW ME LOVE, SHOW ME LOVE, TIL I AM READY FOR MORE\\". Really cool. 9.5 of 10.<br />4. 30 minutes: In how much time can pain kill you???, How much time does it take to forget pure and true love???, How much blood is it needed for true love to be free???. This is my favourite song, sad, melancholic and powerful song. Definetly one of the best ballads ever, and one of their singles, you´ve got to see the video, it is amazing as well. 10 of 10.<br />5. How soon is now: You are not dreaming, if you like the Charmed TV SHOW Openning, then this is your song, if you don´t it doesn´t matter you are going to love it anyway. It is the same song than the TV Show, the only difference is that this one really rocks!!!!. 9 of 10.<br />6. Clowns (Can you see me now): Are you ashamed of what these two girls are doing???, They don´t even care, this song tells us what Lena and Yulia think about those ones who always critize and talk about them. It doesn´t matter if you are straight or not, I am straight and believe me this song talks about forbidden love. If you love someone, then don´t care if \\"CLOWNS ARE AROUND YOU\\". Because pure and true love is simply that. 9.5 of 10.<br />7. Malchick Gay: If you like Dance, Trance, Electronic or any kind of this music styles then this one will be your favourite song. Tender and soft song, really good one. 9.5 of 10.<br />8. Stars: One of the coolest song of the CD, probably the 4th best of the album. The Russian chorus make it more than special, it makes it unique. It talks about desillution and the end of love. 9.5 of 10.<br />9. Ya Shosla S Uma: \\"All the things she said\\" in Russian, actually it should be \\"I´ve lost my mind\\". Whether if you know Russian or not, doesn´t matter if you don´t get a word, this song is the best, can´t denny it, can you???. 10 of 10.<br />10. Nas Ne Dagonyat: I love this song in Russian, in English it is \\"Not gonna get us\\". It is 10 times better in Russian than in English. The chorus sounds much better. 10 of 10.<br />11. Show me Love (EXTENDED): This version is the 2nd best song of the album, it is really amazing, it doesn´t matter your sexual preferences, this song talks about love, my girlfriend loves it, I do too. 10 of 10.<br />12. All the things she said video and Interview: Well, we must admit that Yulia and Lena don´t speak too much English, but it really doesn´t matter, because they really rock singing!!!!!. Yulia is really sexy!!!, Lena too. 20 of 10. The best POP ROCK video of the year!!!!!!!!.
B002BJGYTY|5|Love watching this with my thirteen year old daughter, and the feeling is mutual. How could I not give it five stars for that alone?
B003DZX3SA|5|we love it
B00005OCMR|5|I was thrilled with all the extras you get for your twenty-five bucks.  Six trailers, and 80-minute &quot;making-of&quot;, tons of other interviews, and then the movie.... When I would watch this classic film on videocassette, my big gripe was always that the soundtrack was fuzzy; it was hard to understand what people were saying sometimes.  Not here, though!  Here the speech is crystal clear, and the picture is beautiful.  If you're looking for a quality recording of this movie, this is it!
B005HSL626|4|Fun game,  my 5 yr old loves it!
B0015AARJI|5|This is great. Of course it should have been out during launch but who cares anyway. I didn't get a PS3 till the MGS4 bundle came out and this was included. I decided to get another controller to be able to play madden with my buddies and it couldn't be better. The only controller that is capable of competing with this one is the Nyko Zero and the only way I would buy the Nyko over this one is if it is 5 bucks which I did on Black Friday.
B004UID2LC|5|its a useful app I recommend it to anyone I dont have to pay to download any type of song its so GOOD......:-)
B008JGSM6G|5|It's fun and challenging........it gets harder each puzzle. It's a real brain teaser. Endless hours of fun. I really like it.
B00B1ME3DQ|5|This album hits all of Clutch's signature styles from blues to hard shouting &#34;HELL YEAH&#34; kinda rock. There's a little something for everyone on this album!
B0025VLELQ|5|Great movie to remember if you grew up as a kid in the 80s that loved Sci-fi.  Got this to watch with my kids once they're older to enjoy it as well.      Quality of the blu-ray was descent.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I love this game but was very distressed when after playing it for a year I couldn't transfer my progress to my new kindle.
B00ARF93AQ|5|A real action movie. From start to finish ALL ACTION. No stupid sub-plots or love stories. Just action. Real Dredd
B000LTAY1U|5|This watch is an excellent value, it has 21 jewels with a self winding movement. The size is ideal for me as I do not like large clunky watches.
0385512058|5|If you want to build a network of personal and business relations to help you succeed, have friends and be happy take a dose of this book and \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" by Dale Carnegie.  To me, these are the two seminal books on how to network, how to truly appreciate your fellow human beings, and how to exercise that network for the benefit of those around you and your own ultimate success.
0307388840|5|Beautifully written.  There's a scene in which the mother sits and thinks about her life that is a fascinating insight into her character.  I saw the movie first and still enjoyed the book immensely.
B00EL8I8IS|3|I like Brad Pitt as an actor and producer, however, a story about zombies leaves me cold.  I did watch the entire show and found it an interesting story to &#34;cure&#34; them.  I will not be watching it for a second time.
B00AEFXIIW|5|A great movie with Japanese and American Actors
B002UM5BXW|5|I could listen to Anthony read a 1st grade primer!!! This book is hilarious, if you are a fan of Mr. Bourdain's wicked and offbeat sense of humour.
1439156816|2|I hear writers talk about this book all the time. It's on almost every author's list of craft books no writer should be without. Unfortunately, the book isn't written to be an instructional guide to better writing. It's written purely as a biography with a few writing tidbits mixed in the story. If you enjoy Mr. King enough to read the story of his life, by all means dive in. You're bound to enjoy it. If you're looking for hints to improve your writing, be prepared to read the entire book. It's not written to be skimmed or digested in chapters. You find the writing advice tucked among the rest of the story.
B008NA3I30|5|A classic Michelle Williams Movie, excellent.  NO one could play this part like Michelle.  If you are a Michelle Williams fan, then<br />you will have to own this film.  I bought the DVD then bought the bluray version.

B004XJRQUQ|5|If you've read the book, you know. If you haven't read the books, you should. Good writing, cleaver plot twists, and the first person narrative of Katiness Everdeen make for an engaging read. (I read all three books in the span of 16 days.)

B00GH75V1S|3|All though this movie is well acted, it end up being not much more than an action movie. I thought the villain was not understandable verbally and motivationally. Ultimately I missed the retribution at the end and the emotional connection of the hero's sacrifice.
1878424114|5|I applied what I have learned from this book and it has changed my life. I have less stress now, and a marked improvement in my health. In addition a promotion that would not have been possible with out the things I have learned from T.S.S.L.of S.. It works for basically good people (with an  open mind) that want to be better. I gave a copy to a friend that was  having people problems at his work place. He was ready to quit his job. Two  days later he called me and said, &quot;Man this stuff really works!&quot;

B0006IJ5PM|5|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" tells of the 1988 Odessa, Texas high school football team.  In Texas, football is king, and the hopes and dreams of entire towns can ride on their team.  Odessa won state championships before, but this team is perhaps a bit smaller than usual, and the coach is new and untested.  Fortunately, they have Boobie Miles, a star player who could possibly carry them to the state championship.  The movie follows these players over the season, as the town alternates between rallying around them and vilifying them.<br /><br />Based on the non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" doesn't rely on the \\"big game\\" ending typical of sports movies.  The movie focuses on football, but it relies more on the characters.  It's about a town that is economically depressed and needs something behind which to rally.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" could be just another Cinderella sports story.  However, it's not about winning - it's about the pressure the town puts on the team and the coach.  Fortunately, the acting is superb, especially Lucas Black (\\"Sling Blade\\") as the glowering quarterback and Derek Luke (\\"Antwone Fisher\\") as the star, Boobie.  You feel for these boys; you want them to win; but most of all, you want them to have some kind of life after the season draws to a close.  That's what \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is all about, and it's a really terrific movie.
B000MKD9P6|5|As an avid reader it is very rare that I enjoy a movie more than I do the book, but with The Devil Wears Prada it wasn't even close. The movie took the book and the characters to a whole other level---and I enjoyed every moment of it.<br /><br />We get to see Andrea in the beginning going for a job interview at a magazine, just trying to get her foot in the door. At the time she has no idea what Runway is and what it means to others, but when she meets Emily and then Miranda, she sees that for some fashion is not just something to wear. It is a lifestyle.<br /><br />We then get to watch the evolution in Andrea's personal and professional lives, and at that point we can see not just the effect of Miranda on her but Emily opening herself up to what is possible for her.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is not as much about Miranda as it is about the choices we make about the life we live. In fact Miranda share that lesson with Emily in one of the most powerful conversations in the whole movie. \\"Everybody wants to be us,\\" she said. Everyone wants to be admired, respected and recognized for what they bring to the world. In that moment, Emily realizes that the confidence she has gotten from working at Runway can be hers no matter where she is.<br /><br />This is a movie that will entertain you, make you laugh and also make you think. It also shows that sometimes lessons can come from the most unlikely of sources.
B006ID6NDQ|5|When I was a young college student, I had the pleasure of attending a lecture by Simon Weisenthal. History was not a subject I found interesting. My dad served in the Aleutiann Islands in Alaska and by the time I was born in 1964, the war did not seem real to me. Mr. Wiesenthal changed that and I am now reading as much as I can about the war. I cannot imagine the atrocities the Nazi regime imposed on the Jewish. All the suffering, losing everything, losing your entire family and way of life. Mrs. Beer tells her amazing story of survival against all odds. It is a sad story in many ways, yet her strength and will to survive is inspiring.

B0001AVZA8|4|After watching this movie after two years of procrastination, I asked myself why did I wait for two years to find such a gem.    If you are a fan of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\", then, you probably know what to expect on this one.  To make a subtle comedy romantic movie isn't easy because the storyline has got to be good, the cast needs to have chemistry, their comic timing has got to be impeccable, and the scripts need to be tight. I have to say that other than minor glitches, this movie simply breezes through.  What other reviewers said about underutilising Frances McDormand, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet is true but what bothers me more is that whilst all efforts are made to ensure that Jack's and Diane's characters are as wholesome as possible, Keanu's character seems to be a cookie cutter character with a rather two dimension perspective.  Whilst the ending is what all dreamers like you and I are wanting, right in the snowy night in Paris, and that they all live happily ever after, I find it too formulaic and too good to be true.  Still, the journey heading to the final destination is such a joy to watch.  There are elements in this movie that reminds me fondly of \\"The Producers\\" which is now to be converted into a movie medium.  I find the DVD great with two versions of commentary, one with the main cast and the other with the Director and Producer who are covering the dryer and technical aspect of the movie.  The commentary of the cast commenting upon some of their funnier moments in the making of the movie is hillarious and funny for its own sake.  Well, don't miss this one like I did.  Highly recommended.

0439813786|5|<br />You know that feeling when you're sitting in a movie theater and the lights dim? The audience hushes, the curtain opens, the music starts to play, and suddenly you feel as if anything can happen, as if your very dreams could be projected up there on the screen.  <br /> <br />OK, on the other hand, maybe you don't know --- or remember --- that feeling at all. In this age of megaplexes, stadium seating, DVDs and home theater systems, it's hard to imagine a time when going to the movies was truly a magical experience. In his fascinating new novel, THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET, Brian Selznick brilliantly recaptures this feeling and repackages it for a new generation.  <br /> <br />Selznick's reputation up until now has been primarily as an illustrator, so it's no coincidence that nearly half the novel's pages consist of wonderfully detailed line drawings. What's remarkable about the way Selznick uses illustrations, though, is that the pictures --- often as much as the text --- help to tell the story, to set a scene, even to develop characters.  <br /> <br />Take the novel's opening pages, for example. On the first two-page spread, we see a full moon peeking out of a small white box in the middle of a sea of black. On the next page, the box opens up to reveal more of the sky. Likewise, in the third and fourth pages, the black border (like movie theater curtains) retracts to reveal the Paris skyline. Subsequent pages focus on the Paris train station, and finally settle in on one particular boy in the teeming, bustling crowd inside.  <br /> <br />That boy is Hugo Cabret, whom we proceed to meet in the text that follows. Hugo is a lonely boy, an orphan who has been charged with maintaining the many clocks in the train station. Hugo secretly lives in the station, too, stealing what he needs to get by. This includes not only food, but also small mechanical toys from the grouchy old gentleman who runs a toy shop in the station. Hugo needs the parts to help him repair the clocks --- and to try to fix his greatest secret and most prized possession.  <br /> <br />It's an automaton, an incredibly intricate mechanical man. Hugo's father found the machine and spent years trying to fix it. After his father's death, Hugo is determined to fix the automaton. After all, the automaton's mechanism should allow it to write --- maybe even to pass on a message from Hugo's dead father. If only he could find a way to make it work!  <br /> <br />Soon enough, though, Hugo's thefts get him in big trouble with the toy shop owner. Hugo's new connection to the man and his busybody goddaughter seems to threaten the future of the automaton as well as Hugo's own well-guarded secrets. Or could it be that these new acquaintances are just what Hugo needs after all?  <br /> <br />Inspired by real historical characters and films, Selznick's novel is a real breakthrough in storytelling technique. By using illustrations --- including not only his intricate drawings but also film stills and other archival photos --- to further the plot, establish setting and even develop his characters, Selznick's spare prose seems to gain gravity and importance as well. Readers will pore over not only the illustrations, but also the words, which are rarely wasted and often contain real wisdom.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl <br />

1932100385|4|I grew up in a small Chinese village, and vividly remember the faces of all the old-age people when I was a child. I have been back to the same village a few times in the last few years, have seen the difference between now and the time before the economic boom. Now people have much better life, and they are eating much \\"better\\", yet the villagers are dying much younger, with all kind of modern health problems: heart problems, all kind of cancers, etc. What I am saying is not scientifically based, yet I want to say it: I think the life span of Chinese villagers is shorter now than 20 years ago, when they were much poorer, consuming mostly \\"raw\\" stuff. This early deaths of the people in my home town puzzled me and my wife a great deal, and we have been wondering: why? why they are all dying so young when they are all enjoying a much \\"better\\" life? <br /> <br />I bought the book, and will read it with great interest. I am working in the field of medicine that treats cancer patients, and I always wonder why there are so many cancer patients in the States?, and I was surprised that the Chinese villagers are now having all kinds of cancers, and having the diseases unheard of during my child years. <br /> <br />I will try to share with you my persepctive after I read the book. <br /> <br />Kevin in California

B00FCQQ1IW|5|The fourth  book of the Clifton Chronicles like the first three kept me burning the Midnight Oil. Jeffrey Archer is one of the best<br />mystery writers of our time. The ending left me disappointed as I will be on pins and needles waiting for the continuation which<br />won't be available until 2015.  something for a past 80 year old to look forward to.  I hardly recommend readers to start with<br />book one.
B0000026J6|3|Laughin Lenny writes great simple melodies and brilliant complex lyrics, but he doesn't seem to take a firm hand when it comes to arranging and producing his records. When he's got sympathetic collaborators who give him folk arrangements, the albums are brilliant. When his collaborators try to bring him &quot;up to date&quot;, the results can be very frustating.<br />The songwriting on &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; is peerless - dry and sombre moralism, witty and self-deprecating. But the production, which may have been &quot;industry standard&quot; in 1988, is now so dated it's a trial to listen to this from start to end. Tinny drum machines, synthesiser washes, cheesy female vocalists. Not everything suffers equally: &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; has a beautiful flamenco guitar counterpoint, and &quot;Take this Waltz&quot; features gorgeous violin and co-lead vocals from Jennifer Warnes. But it's tough to sit through the stuttering artificial drums and sweetly anonymous backing vocals of &quot;Jazz Police&quot;.<br />This is one of the strongest available doses of Lenny's worldview, and I'd love this album like crazy if I could block out the 80's veneer.
B00KW272YS|4|Very good movie, was really a prequel to the Ryan series but in current time frame which was a bit confusing. I kept waiting for the dialog to mention his father. Good action packed film.
B00005QIPH|4|The Stokes CD was very hyped up, but this CD is just great. Some of the songs took a lot of getting used too, which is why this album didn't get five stars, but, there is a great majority of songs that when I heard, I fell in love with. I dont really agree with anyone detracting stars because of it being overhyped, the CD should be rated for the music.
B000HF6XV8|5|Tired of violence and sex? Maybe not, but if so, this is a great getaway from those movies. Wholsome and a great story line. I highly recommend for both adults and kids.
B008VVT51U|5|I enjoyed watching this movie, It is funny and a little bit sad. It was one of the most delightful films I have seen in awhile.  I just loved the characters, played by some of my most favorite actors. I highly recomend this film to all.
B00HBQWGXK|5|Reacher is 50+ now if my math is correct. Lee Child gives him his due, tho. Jack is just as analytical, just as strong as ever. I appreciated that he didn't jump in the sack, that Lee has let him mature in his own way. I adore this whole series, and have read each book at least twice. Jack (and I) may be getting older..but it's good to know doing well stays the same...

1451637500|5|The latest Vorkisigan novel delivers all the elements we've come to love in Bujold's tales: wit and intelligence, strategy and courage, and the best elements of humanity embodied in people who at first glance, are unlikely to have these qualities.<br /><br />Bujold also routinely tackles larger questions, but so thoroughly enmeshes them in the narrative that you might not realize they're being addressed: abortion, genetic engineering, empowerment of the \\"differently abled\\", abuse of power in the military and the government, and other weighty topics have featured in previous stories. Cryoburn is no different.<br /><br />The result is, once again, a solid read that captures us with its action and suspense, but satisfies on a much deeper level as well.
B007IXWKUK|5|The 2nd in a continued romance of a lost soul and the women who is trying to change him. The intense sexual references and times they have it are unreal.The author writes in simple easy to relate to language. Still, somehow, she keeps you wanting more. Fifty Shades Darker is definately a must read. It will make you think about what a person's past does and who would be strong enough to help overcome the obstacles (even if they are in the red room of pain).Yikes, as a bite my tongue!

B000009RC2|5|I never heard of this group until a few months back when someone recomended it to me. I was reluctant to buy it because of the name thinking it was some Indian group with a bunch of  chanting or whatever. I decided to give it a try, and I was totally and  completley blown away by everything and everyone on this album. I haven't  heard music that has blown me away so much since maybe the first time I  heard Cream or Hendrix, and even now on don't think they compare. These  guys just are so great! They go from fiery speed on some tracks to gentle  melodic songs on others. I now have bought everything buy them, and I wish  there was more. If you are never going to buy another album in your life,  make this your last one. It will be worth every penny and much much more.

0780622553|5|&quot;Dark City&quot; by Alex Proyas (The Crow) is a strange, wierd masterpiece that serves as one of the most daring and original movies ever made! Here we see great use of imagination as well as screenwriting and  plotting. The story is fantastic! It's like a murder-mystery wrapped inside  dark science fiction. Few films look so good! The cinematography is  incredibly well done. I especially loved Proyas's camera angles. We are  taken into a lush yet gothic city. We see strange and frightening  characters like the beings dressed in black. This is an astonishing triumph  in visual and dramatic qualities.
B007J4T2G8|1|Its typical BAD fan-fiction really. However it is good for a gag gift. Its really insulting to real literature. Is it really mostly desperate housewives that read this piece of junk?

1597801577|5|Fantastic Read! A plausible dystopian future. No clear good guys, or bad guys, people trying through a genetically engineered global environmental disaster, in the tiny pool of survival of Bangkok. Great writing style, one of the best book I have read in years. Its worth reading the \\"Windup Stories\\", that can be found on line, as an intro to this book.

B00005JN0T|3|I watched this one with my family over the weekend and, quite frankly, had a ball.  Yeah, to some extent it's a movie with a message, but mainly it's just plain entertaining.  If you try to read too much into it, you'll miss the opportunity for a good old-fashioned sci fi romp.<br /><br />Fast forward to the year 2035.  The monolithic company \\"U.S. Robotics\\" has put NS-4 domestic assistant robots into mass production, so much so that they are commonplace \\"members\\" of American society.  Their artificial intelligence is designed to be as much like humans as possible, but is regulated by the \\"3 laws\\" programming that is hardwired into every robot.  These laws are:  1. To protect human life above all; 2. To obey human commands except if it would violate law 1; and 3. To protect its own existence unless doing so would violate laws 1 or 2.  The laws seem a foolproof way to ensure that the robots would never pose a threat to humanity.  But all that changed when the man billed as the father of robotic technology and the 3 laws turns up dead in a very public, and very suspicous, manner, just as the new and improved NS-5 model is about to flood the market.  The death is quickly written off by all concerned as a suicide.  All except detective Dale Spooner, this is.<br /><br />Being a good cop and a sharp detective, Spooner (played by Will Smith) in not content that the professor's death was a suicide, and begins investigating with the lead suspect, an NS-5 robot named \\"Sonny\\".  Sonny's intelligence is so advanced, and his \\"emotions\\" so well simulated, that he appears to have something resembling a human soul.  Spooner believes that Sonny killed the professor, and sets out to prove it.  His (over)zealous approach to the task, coupled with his deep distrust of robots and their manufacturer, quickly lands him in hot water with some powerful people.  Some difficult and destructive encounters with the metallic menaces leave him looking like an obsessive paranoiac, and ultimately result in his suspension from the police force.<br /><br />Spooner continues his chase nonetheless, following a series of clues left by the dead professor, as step by step the mystery begins the unwind.  All along the way are some great action sequences, plot twists and one-liners.  However, except for Will Smith's character (which is the same as it has been in every film he has done since \\"Men in Black\\"), nothing about the story is predictable.  When the final shoe drops, most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the unexpected ending.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a wild ride with lots of great sci fi treats and effects.  The only downsides were the lack of character development on any signficant level -- this is a purely plot-driven movie -- and the fact that Will Smith essentially played himself, much as he always does.  Still, it's worth seeing.  I certainly don't regret the investment of two hours.spension from the police force.

B0000E1WKE|5|I had to actually hide this one.  I let friends play it and they tried to leave it in their CD player.  I guess you know I checked the case and it was empty, I politely waited for the owner to open the player and retrieve it.  It is a lovely ablum all the songs were great and the quality was tood.
B00003CWPL|5|Yeah that sort of word gets bandied around a lot. If something is just a little bit weird, it deemed \\" surreal \\"<br />This film however really is surreal and while I don't want to give anything away ( how can I? If I were to describe this you'd probably think I was a bit cuckoo ), it is brilliantly acted. I remember watching this the first time in a friend's house. I brought it over since I really wanted to see it and not some horrible Hollywood movie and all I can say is that when the film was finished and I went to the toilet, I looked at myself in the mirror and I was as white as a ghost. There was not one bit of colour in me. That's how bizarre and scary this film is.<br />However ( on a side note ) if you're looking for a similar film I would suggest getting Un Chien Andalou. Made in 1928 but equally as baffling and surreal. Watch both Un Chien Andalou and Eraserhead back to back and I guarantee you - it's not a pleasant experience

B001FB4W0W|5|If you enjoy vampire, supernatural amd romance genre, then this series is for you.  TruBlood loosely follows author Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse series of SciFi/romance novels and does it well.  The casting for the series is excellent with the actors fulfilling the temperments of the characters, and often as not the physical characteristics, also.  The plot lines differ to some extent but are still as anjoyable as the books and plausible within the story setting.  After awhile, one would not be surprised to read in the news that vampires have come out and are living in Bon Temps, LA.  This definitely is not intended for a younger and sensitive audience.  But if you are in the mood for horror and SciFi with a sexy attitude, sit back, kick up your feet, grab a bottle of TruBlood (yes, it is avaiable on the internet) and enjoy!

B00000K0E5|5|It had been the longest wait for a Bond movie, 6 years. But in 1995, Pierce Brosnan delivered! Goldeneye is always a fan favorite for it's gripping story, a brand new 007, a new M, exciting villains, beautiful girls, gadgets galore and the sophisticated class of it all. <BR>The story begins in 1986, with 007 and Alec Terevelyan,(006) working together to destory a chemical factory in the Soviet Union. The movie begins with a thrilling ski dive from Bond. The plot to destory the factory goes awry when they are caught by General Ourumov and the Russian soldiers. Trevelyan is captured and killed, (or so it appears to be.) Bond is enraged and makes a daring escape via a motorcycle, driving right off a cliff to catch a moving plane. He does this while being fired at by the Soviets. Bond finally catches the plane and we are sweeped into one of the best main title sequences in years! The movie resumes in 1995, with Bond driving the famous Aston Martin, and meeting the daunting Xenia Onatopp. He meets her again at a local casino, and the two exchange the usual Bond glib remarks. We then discover through a certain scene that Xenia is not what she seems to be and that she kills an officer to take his pass to a helicoptor demonstration the next day. Xenia and Ouromov steal a highly protective helicoptor and take it to northern Russia. They steal a secret space weapon called Goldeneye, that is able to destroy anything with an electronic circuit. They fire it on Severnaya and escape with a computer whiz called Boris. While this is going on, Bond is being briefed by M to get the Goldeneye back. Bond meets a CIA agent called Jack Wade and an old enemy-turned-ally called Valentin Zukovsky. They help him track down the mysterious Janus, who was responsible for the theft of the Goldeneye. Bond finally meets him and discovers him to be Alec Trevelyan, who is angry at Britain for the deaths of his parents. Bond meets Natayla, a beautiful survivor of the Goldeney attack, and they escapefrom capture to hunt down Alec, Xenia and Ourumov. Ourumov is killed on the train/fight sequence. There is also a stunning tank escape. Bond and Natayla go to Cuba, where Alec has another Goldeneye satellite, and plans to steal the money from the bank of England, and then destroy London. Bond kills Xenia and is then caught by Alec. There is a terrific fight between the two, with a deadly cat and mouse hunt. Bond and Alec eventually end up on the actual satellite, and Alec falls to his death. The satellite is destroyed and Bond and Natalya fly off to enjoy some peace. <BR>Goldeneye features a riveting title song by Tina Turner, and the music video is included. A Bond movie documentary and a audio commentary is also present. A behind the scenes feature and theatre previews are also included on the DVD.<BR>Goldeneye is one of the best Bond movies and all 007 fans will enjoy it!

B008MWBY6W|2|I prefer to leave the lens on the camera and when storing in the bag, The camera and lens does not fit well inside the bag and is definitely not conducive for an additional lens to be carried.
B000VWYJ86|5|Matt Damon does a wonderful job as usuall on this video! Hope we see another sequel. I've collected all the Bourne DVD's! Thanks for sending so quickly! It was received on time and in great shape.
B0036S4B6M|5|Wow!! Finishing the story made me feel as if I had finished a stay behind bars.  Although there were some stereotypes that I expected in the narrative, there were welcomed unexpected characters and events.  Piper Kerman moved me to tears and created a compassion in me that I had not felt before for those who spend time in criminal institutions.  I was really able to see the women as people that I interact with in my own life.  I learned that most can adapt to whatever life offers, even when freedom is taken away.  I cheer for those who have learned from their mistakes and will be a little less eager to condemn those who make mistakes in society.  Thank you, \\"Kerman,\\" for sharing the intimate details of your year in the prison environment.  Aunt Inny in [[ASIN:1419615378 Nothing But the Blood]] barely escaped a similar destiny.
B00319ECHE|3|After a large mess and FF being set aside the disc shows it. It's ok, but the same old FF without Chritian and it shows. There is no twist or track that stands out. Sad to say I'm not impressed. It doesn't hold the fire to get your frustrations out as in the past. The lyrics are about basically nothing; Burton is loosing his edge. Good if your a past FF fan and want some background noise to read a book to. If just now being introduced to FF try the previous discs 1st...
B00A8V3VVG|5|Lovely soundtrack. Enjoyed as much as the movie. Strongly recommended for everyone who enjoys QT movies and westerns and good tunes.
B004X75RK4|5|Loved it! Great movie for a girl's night! Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds were great in this film together. Enjoyed every minute.
B005K17RU0|5|Better than the Weather Channel app by leaps and bounds. I especially like how quickly the radar map loads. Excellent app.
B006LSZECO|4|Great story. It has a lot of twists. Gone is a  great summer read. It's a definite page turner.  I'd like to talk about the ending but I don't want to spoil it. Must read
B004XJRQUQ|5|With all the hoopla currently surrounding this series I had to give it a shot. The Amazon price pretty much matched the offer from the Science Fiction Book Club of which I have been a member since high school (I'm 60 yrs old now) so I took a shot. And found an incredible hypothesis for a possible future. A mix of ancient Roman and feudal culture for North America as seen through the eyes of a young girl caught in its sinister nets. So far, an engaging read and a must for apocalyptic sf fans.
B005EYP8PO|5|Well, I'm an U2 fan. And this album is one of my favorites, because it marks one of the many turning points they faced in their carreer.
B00LD1OHE0|2|Mmmmmmm another teen novel! Nothing special about it.. Predictable!
B00688628M|5|Similar in some ways to &#34;Pacific&#34;, this series does not disappoint. A couple developed and good characters, lots of action, sense of realism about human nature in war, and, of course, based on real history. Watching the series is a wonderful way to honor the memory of that &#34;greatest generation&#34; on the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Europe. I have also put Stephen Ambrose's book, on which the series is based, on my summer reading list.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Good addictive game just like floppy bird a very good concept for a game. Very fun best game of all time ever
B007V4QKKC|5|Love p!nk
B0040I09RM|5|Great!!
B00L23RZO8|3|The movie was very high brow, sort of black humor with a great cast of characters.  The actors in the movie were very well cast in their particular roles.  A lot of humor, tongue in cheek, type, and really wonderfully portrayed.
B00006AG5N|5|This CD is the absolute best remastering of an Elvis CD that I've ever heard.  The songs are perfect, it sounds like they were just recorded.  Its a must for any Elvis Fan !!
B0066WJLU6|5|A very helpful tool. Provides an amazing blast of light.
B00F88U4J6|3|FBReader is my go-to reader for simplicity. Moon+ is still on my tablet should I find a book format that need it.

B0083GQ2A0|1|This movie is horrible, i spent over an hour full of language and wasted my time on this movie. Very disappointed !
B00992CF6W|4|I have this for the kindle and the .5.0 update isn't out it is for the iphone and ipod and stuff but there is no update for kindle
B008IBPMZG|5|Excellent
B0071XO8RA|5|I couldn't put this book down.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|This was a book club suggestion. Everyone thought it was a good book. It was a fast read and the outcome was not what was expected. Some of the book club members could relate to some of the issues discussed in the book. We enjoyed discussing it.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Excellent movie. Quite enjoyable. They do a great job of paying homage to the original &#34;Star Trek&#34;.  After the death of Leonard Nimoy, it is nice to know that we still have this franchise to carry on the torch for a while longer.
B00BD99JMW|5|Love the whole series....the ending sucked only because I like happy endings which is unrealistic I suppose.  Really great read all around just the same!
B00ADS98FC|5|This movie is hilarious!! I can watch it over and over again and it gets better every time! Fat Amy steals the show!
B0086700CM|4|Okay I love the game and when it came out on the kindle I knew I had to get it.The graphics are wonderful. But when I go to turn sometimes it picks up as a jump, and then when I jump it picks it up as a slide. I can ignore it most of the, but what I really have a problem with is the glitches. I know there are glitches on a lot of games, but this one has way too many. That's annoying and irritating.<br /><br />Fix the glitches and the touch problems and I would give it five stars.
B00AEK9BKQ|5|The fact that the story is real makes this film amazing, the acting is flawless and the story is touching and beautiful and inspiring.
B00FAPF5U0|5|GET IT RIGHT NOW you will find it hard not to mention of it its awesome and the most important thing is that the game is challenging
B005544TRQ|5|Great!
B005LAIIHG|1|They must have made several copies of this DVD to sale because that is the only reason why it would not play in my DVD player. It does not play on regular DVD players. Trust me. I tried it on mine, my parents', and my grandfather's with no luck. It keeps saying bad disc. I could play it on the computer, tv/dvd combo and even my small radio/cd/tv/dvd portable boombox type, though. I returned it, and received a new one that did the same thing. I did not want to go through the hassle to return it, so I had to connect my boombox to my tv in lieu of my actual dvd player to get this to play on my tv. This is terrible. All my other dvds play even one that was new that I had not gotten around to opening.
B005544V6A|5|Watch the show, you hate some of the characters to the core, and some others you really like.  The lines are punchy and really good.  Go and get Litt Up!
B00AW0KHMY|3|It does not say in Walmart's description that you will get the extras with the extended part one. It mentions extras on part 2 ONLY. They may have put in this disc mentioned that doesn't have the extra features.<br />Buyer Beware
B00992CF6W|5|Amaze I love this game
B00L9B7IKE|5|It was so good! It was very hard to put down.
0446310786|5|Perfect
B00HDMMISA|4|A little different from her other books, but I enjoyed it.  Always a little mystery
B00O0MBHR4|3|was fair at best
B008PZZOF8|5|Just a plain fun Hollywood movie to kill some time on a laid back weekend.  Great Fun!!!  :-)
B00CWY76CC|5|HAD FUN playing this game with my 9 year old.  Levels are challenging, but not  over the top.  Waiting patiently for more levels to become  available.
B000002MY3|1|What makes Alanis such a treasure is the honesty of her convictions and her absolute allegiance to commoners everywhere. When she plaintively emotes \\"I've got one hand in my pocket,\\" you realize she could be singing about anyone.
B00NBXVKCU|5|A classic album from state to finish.  There was simply nothing like it on the radio.
B00HCOSF3G|5|This song just makes me happy, every time I listen to it. Thanks Pharrell Williams, we need more positive songs like this one :) wishing a happy day to everyone.
0312263120|1|The beginning of the story was good. As it went onwards it picked p momentum. Later on, it dropped behind. <br />I was able to predict even before I reached one quarter, that The Commander was the crook.  <br />Similarities.....similarities....similarities. <br />Decoding - common to Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Digital Fortress.  <br />Same type of second villains - Assassin in DVC; Hutolot in Digital Fortress. <br />Arch Villains - The Commander in DF; Sir something something in DVC; the Popes personal secretary in A&D. <br /> <br />Digital Fortress - after half-way, it is 'sodhappal'. <br />Know what a 'sodhappal' is? <br />Maybe Dan Brown will have to try his hand at decding this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was honestly perfect. It really brought out real emotion. couldn't have asked for a better book to read til three in the morning
B001BKVWYG|5|I bought this album after seeing the Searching for Sugar Man movie.  I loved the movie, I love the man Rodriguez, and I love this album.  I bought the other one too (Coming from Reality).  This album is the better of the two, but Coming from Reality is also highly recommended.
B000BYCAJE|5|Good music.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book is my summer reading program book for the college I'm attending in August. I bought it 3 days ago and completely fell in love with it, while it looked like I was on my phone constantly I just had my face stuck in the book. I recommend this to everyone. It is a must read! I've never fell absolutely in love with a book until I read this! Absolutely amazing.
B00BKTFABE|3|The video camera on the kindle fire hdx actually is better than this app.  These vidos were not as sharp.  I deleted this app... don't want to use room for something I don't need.
0385366752|4|This review is for the audio CD version of Gone Girl written by Gillian Flynn and performed by Julian Whelan (Amy Elliot Dunn) and Kirby Heyborne (Nick Dunne). Gone Girl details Nick and Amy's toxic marriage and Amy's disappearance on their fifth wedding anniversary. Gillian Flynn is an incredible writer and does a great job of understanding the human physche and shortcomings. I enjoyed this novel although I would have had a harder time finishing the book if I hadn't been listening to the audio version because it dragged on in spots. The excellent character voice choices added to the story and helped push it through the slow spots. I really liked the story but the ending was anti climatic. I would recommend this book to fans of psychological thrillers and other Gillian Flynn novels
B00I6IKSZ0|4|I've been playing this game for 2 years now and it was fun until the Christmas update came and they added op guns like laser mini gun mechs turrents jetpacks and the worst feature is gems I mean seriously the only way you can get gems unless you level up or buy them so they should either think of a way to get them easier or get rid of them and also they made armour so op so at least make the armour not as strong and one request for an update is score streaks like if you get 5 kills in a row you could get air support and also add a mini map that is all but overall it's a pretty good game
B000U0F7RG|4|Loved the series, was disappointed because some of the disks came scratched.
B001FB4W0C|5|as advertised
B0064X7FVE|4|The weather channel, nice to have when you need it.  Stupid to have to complete a word count on a review
B000089RV6|4|This is one of the best remasters I have ever heard.  Every instrument is clear & loud & thunders from my speakers the way AC/DC should.  The booklet is full of great photos & the essay covers the story of this classic album well. The reason I have given 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lyrics (which were provided with the original CD issue) are not included. This should be mandatory with ALL reissues.  <br /> <br />The digipak packaging is better than some previous resissues & overall this fan is extremely satisfied. The music of course needs no review. This is the classic AC/DC album & has never been bettered.
B00GH4R95C|5|The fight scenes in the movie were a lot better than the first one. And this could be the one that replaces the original Superman movies.
B0089LOG02|5|I very much enjoyed reading the Orphan Train.  It was recommended by someone in my book club and all members loved it.  What a good story.  Sometime a little sad, but I believe good books are sad sometime.
B0074D3CAQ|2|An exquisitely well written and seductive celebration of the meaninglessness of life.  I enjoyed the marvelous scenery of England and Harold's determination to escape the trap that passes for normal life on earth but his pilgrimage ultimately ends in acceptance of it rather than triumph, at least that is how it left me feeling.  This embrace of mortality has become increasingly fashionable as shown by the awards and accolades earned by this book.  If that is your cup of tea, you will not find many better examples.
B007JZW3VS|5|A real page-turner. Wouldn't let go of the book to the last page. I'll be looking for other books by McCullers.
B005K17RU0|5|Love it. I'm always looking at the weather as I live about an hour away from the east coast beach. It it always pretty much right. I'm pleased I tried it out & that it works well. I highly recommend this app.
B001TODCII|5|love it
B0054JZC6E|5|this Game is fun an I like how you have to earn points to unlock more games.  get this game
6303481345|4|I recommend this to anyone who seriously likes anme. If you don't, the vulgarity of the movie might seem a little odd.  It's not for anyone under the age of 15!!  There's a sex scene, rape scene (kinda sorta), and nudity.   But don't get me wrong!  The plot's great!  have fun with it!
0316776963|5|I have never read a book like this before in my life.  A few years ago, a friend and I spotted 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' in a local bookstore.  It looked interesting, so we both picked it up, opened it to any page, read only one paragraph.  We both hurled laughter across the entire store at the same time.  I always wondered if the entire book was that funny.  My question was answered in 2006.  I decided to use this week of Sring Break to read it and I am so glad I did.  I have never experienced a book bringing on this kind of laughter.  I would assume that I should not be reading it in public, as I've had some stares from people due to my fits of uncontrollable laughter.  But who's concerned about that?  This book is the absolute best laugh I've had in years.  Highly, highly recommended.
B00942S4OY|4|I have enjoyed listening to the CD, even though it's not what I normally listen too.  They are a really talented group and seem to have their priorities right.
1101946342|5|Loved it!  Was really nice to know his point of view.  Helped to explain his issues.  I hope E L James is going to do this for the other two books too!
B00FVVR2ZO|4|Hidden object games are my favorite. Only on level six, but I love it so far! Can't wait to see more.
B0002Y4T92|5|I think the DVD is great. It is an amazing once in a lifetime event. It is great to watch with a child who just got his first guitar. He will see all of the legends at work. I think that it was more a public jam session than a concert and more or less just the names attracted the crowd. They were jamming and having a good time. Not playing to impress. They've already done that.
B0058VW36U|5|He said it is challenging and fun.  He said it is also non stop action and he won't ride in the car without his tablet!
B008XG1X18|4|great app occassionally crashes but glad to have it for android and the kindle pretty fast and nice big pics
B00I6JOBTI|5|Great movie! My kids love it!
B0097EWK3A|4|Great graphics and story line. Really enjoyed the challenging games. Really looking forward to the next one in the series. Please don't let that take to long!!
B000066F6H|3|I don't know why this album in particular has instigated this tirade from me but for some reason all the bad reviews have really pissed me off.  For whatever reason I'm in the habit of reading the lowest rated reviews of albums I like first.  Usually I just laugh at the ignorant fools who say stuff like, \\"The Velvet Underground is the most over rated band in history,\\" and you won't find a more vigorous Velvets defender than me.  But the handful of lousy reviews for this album, which I don't even give 4 stars myself, really made me mad. <br />First of all, I think that in 2006 it's really idiotic to dismiss a band because they sound like another band.  So the Hives are obviously derivative of the MC5, the Kinks, Da Stooges, etc. and those bands did it first and better.  Of course they did... THEY'RE THE F**KING MC5!  But you know what?  The MC5 hasn't made any new music since 1971.  So any band that worships them as much as I do is cool with me.  As long as they don't rip off riffs directly I'm ok with \\"derivative\\".  Because if you like that old-school crummy rock it's hard to come by and you should be dying for more.  Besides in this day and age it's almost impossible to NOT be derivative of something (before you jump down my throat, I know there are exceptions: Flaming Lips, Sonic Youth, Tom Waits - off the top of my head).  As long as it's done right, with the appropriate reverence/humor, it's perfectly acceptable to wear your influences on your sleeve. <br />Secondly, when people complain that a 30 minute rock album is a rip off because it's too short just tells me that those idiots have absolutely no understanding of rock-n-roll at all let alone the history of the music business.  You see, in the glory days before Compact Discs destroyed music 30 - 40 minutes was the most music you could cram on an LP without losing fidelity.  More than that and you had to either cram the grooves so close you lost sound or you had to move it on to a second LP which was prohibitively expensive.  That's part of the reason some of those first 2 lp albums are real classics, i.e. The White Album, Exile on Maine Street, Blonde On Blonde. [Actually the White Album is a bad example because it was the first album on Apple Records but you get my point.]  In order to convince the label to put out two LPs you really had to have something to say.  Otherwise your album got cut to fit the medium, therefore you left the weaker songs off the record.  The CD's 75 minute format allowed artists to become very poor self-editors.  Whatever crap they recorded got slapped on the CD.  Rarely is there a 75, or even 60 minute album that is good all the way through but, now, the music buying public, in true American-Consumer fashion, has come to demand quantity over quality.  \\"If I'm going to spend $18 on a CD I better be getting 75 minutes of music even if 45 minutes of that is pabulum I'll never listen to.\\"  (For a few years a backlash to this has been building, hence the success of iTunes.)   <br />Anyway, my long rambling point is that - More Is Rarely Better!  The Hives' 30 Minute Veni Vidi Vicious is the perfect length.  No filler.  No tedious solos that need to be skipped over.  The longest song clocks in at 3:22; no time to get bored here.  Just 12 short kick-ass examples of garage rock in almost it's purest form.  I say \\"almost\\" because, despite what some reviewers here say, this album is overproduced.  Personally, I really cherish that recorded-in-my-parent's-basement kind of feel to my crappy rock records; this album is obviously meant to be a little bit more radio friendly.  I can't fault them for that but it's just not my thing. <br />Bottom line is that this is a fun record and I think that a majority of the reviews have missed this point.  If you understand that when I call some music \\"crappy\\" I don't necessarily mean it derogatorily or if you appreciate Lenny Kaye's Nuggets Collection or if you have a collection of cherished 45s you bought at local rock shows then I trust this album will make you smile.  No, it's not as good as the MC5 or the Stooges or what ever high water marks you want set for Rock... But what is?  If you can't get over that I can only suggest your life would be much happier if you get off that pretentious pole you've got lodged in your rectum.
B0067Q42BY|4|I really like this game.  It it quite addicting.  I did turn off the sound, that can be a little distracting.  I chose 4 stars because it is easy to play and there are several variations to it.  It is not boring.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Fun
B008OOYALE|5|Fun game.
B0010X745K|5|Some people think scary movies require some serial killer or ridiculous swamp monster.  For those people, \\"The Mist\\" will likely not be enjoyed.  For others looking for a more developed horror storyline, they may find it enjoyable.    It is the story of a father and son trapped in a grocery store after a mysterious mist settles over the town.  Hidden in this mist are creatures that kill anybody daring to venture from the safety of the building.  However, as the world outside grows more frightening, a crazy religious woman starts to mislead a few people into thinking the way to solve their problem is through sacrifice.  So, on one hand, this movie is a horror movie because of the monsters.  On the other hand, it is a horror movie because the \\"good guys\\" are up against a mob of frightened, mislead town residents that used to be friends and neighbors.    All in all, I liked this movie, as I found it to be psychologically intimidating.  It is not particularly gory, although there are a few bloody scenes from creatures attacking people.  The religious woman got to be a little over the top at the beginning, but she became really scary towards the end and fit really well with the story.  Lots of elements from the novella can be found in this movie, so readers of King may enjoy it.  The ending is different and, although many people say it was dumb and unrealistic, it was the only decent way the story could have ended different from the book and still have the same impact as the remainder of the story.    I give this film 5 stars.  I really like it and think others would too.  My only grievance is that the religious woman was a little annoying at the beginning.
B00EVW0SA0|5|Loved it!
B008D19WBQ|4|I realize many people are upset that these aren't the extended versions of the episodes with the \\"deleted scenes\\" included as part of the episodes as they did for the DVD set.  However, keep in mind, the sound and picture quality are amazing for a 90s sitcom, and the packaging and included booklet are fabulous. I've seen so much detail that I never noticed in the hundreds of times I've watched the DVD episodes. In summary, I choose to focus on the fact that I can finally watch my favorite show in HD widescreen Blu-Ray, instead of getting over-focused on the drawbacks. And remember, these episodes are how the show was meant to be watched. :)
B00EMXBDMA|5|Fantastic read.
B006LA6IW2|5|Very absorbing, well written.
B003F3FJQO|5|Although this book is intense at times, I couldn't get enough. Finished it quickly and can't wait to start the third one. The Cranks are scary and the characters, old and new, make me want to see much, much more of this story. I need to know what's going on!
0061714372|4|OK, I know, Dave Mustaine had some hard knocks, and I completely respect his work and the beast he has created. I love reading about his exploits (a la Scar Tissue from Anthony Kiedis) and his ever changing band. And I find it very cool that someone like Dave Mustaine, who presumably does not need the money, still takes time to write a book such as this. As a guitar player, I just wish he wrote a little more about actual guitar playing.    Regardless, for all your thrash metal fans out there, this is a very cool trip (and I do mean trip) down memory lane. Dave describes the circumstances and the creation of each Megadeth record, and to be honest, also of Kill 'Em All, of which the best song by far, The Four Horsemen, was essentially written by Dave Mustaine. If you're reading this you probably know this. Lord knows his firing from Metallica has been covered in enough magazines and films, but I still couldn't help but wondering what might have been. This was as if Lennon got separated from McCartney due to the instigation of Ringo (and yes, Mustaine is Lennon in this example for anyone needing further explanation).    But I digress... The book is certainly interesting. It kept me engrossed for a 10 hour plane ride and another day spent idle as I waited to climb Kilimanjaro. You will be surprised at his honesty. I knew part of the story, but it is still unbelievable that an album such as Peace Sells could have been made under such circumstances as the band was enduring at the time and yet still stand up as a classic decades later. And though they might have lost the plot in the late 90's (which Dave admits), they/he came back in force with Endgame (and a new Chris, almost as good as the old Chris). Dave Mustaine is the Keith Richards of heavy metal (and I hope I don't offend either of the two by that analogy).    So, a great read. But I'm still wondering, what happened in the unglamorous years of his teens to make him such a good guitar player? Who did he listen to? How much did he practice? How did he practice and what equipment did he use? Etc. This might not be as titillating as tales of drug excess, but for us guitar players, this would be golden.    Still, I can't fault this book. A worthy read for any fan. You can hear Dave's unique voice throughout, sometimes snarling, sometimes triumphant, but always honest.

B003VANOFY|5|I've always been hesitant about getting a wireless headset, but after accidentally yanking the wires out of the splice on two consecutive pairs of [[ASIN:B002BH3JDA Creative Labs HS-980 Fatal1ty Professional Series MKII Gaming Headset (Black)]] I decided it was time to try wireless.    The result has been fantastic.    Not only do they sound as good if not better than my previous sets, but they have 7.1 surround instead of 5.1. They sound amazing.    The wireless range is outstanding, I can go anywhere in my house and still have absolutely pristine reception.    The volume wheel is great, especially when using the set to listen to music or have a conversation via Voip from another room away from the computer. It feels smooth and accessible.    The programmable G-keys are fantastic, My personal usage is to bind one to next track, one to play/pause, and one bound to toggle mouse 5 (my push to talk button). The only downfall is that it apparently isn't possible to have it transmit while you hold the button down and stop when you release, in order to do push-to-talk from what I can see you have to do a toggle. (ie push it once you are transmitting, push again you stop). But still, the 3 G-keys and volume wheel let me use Voip and listen to music from away from my computer.    The battery life seems great so far and the meter in the program seems accurate. I haven't gotten to put it to a full test yet, but I fully expect that it at least comes close to the 9-10 hours it claims. And when you need to charge, all it takes is plugging it in to the docking station or any usb to mini usb cable, and you don't even have to stop using them! So the only inconvenience charging poses is that you have to use it like a normal headset while it charges.    It rests comfortably and doesn't hurt my ears even after hours of use.    I would recommend this to anyone who is considering a wireless set. Especially if you're like me and you've destroyed one too many wired sets.
034580404X|2|This book is the English of a college freshman level.  Teenagers enjoy this more than adults, I think.  I am sorry I bought it
B005SJIP1E|5|There's no need for me to go into a review of any length on this set as others have already done an excellent job of it.<br /><br />I can offer my unqualified recommendation for this set, which is now available at a ridiculously low budget price. The sound is incredible, natural and spectacular. I very much prefer this Sony cycle to Bernstein's DG remakes, which lack the objectivity he brought to his earlier recordings.<br /><br />Grab this before someone figures out they could be charging twice the price without ill abusing consumers.
B00KG2OZIU|2|Decent story.  Good cast but none gave noteworthy performance.
1416972250|3|I was hooked on this series. I thought it was very creative and well written, but am not so happy that there are going to be additional novels written after this. This was originally supposed to be a trilogy, and I think this series should have stayed that way. It should have ended with this book because everything was resolved! Valentine died, Clare and Jace ended up being together after finding out that they aren't siblings, Jocelyn's mother wakes up and finally gets together with Luke, Simon has a girlfriend and, gets over Clary, and Alec gets with Magnus. What else is there to the story?<br /><br />I was very disappointed by the foreshadowing. It was kinda obvious that Johnathan, the real Johnathan is still alive because his body was not found. So I am guessing he will replace his father Valentine as the new villain in the next books. Another thing I really disliked was when the Fairie Queen showed up and talked to Clary. She hinted that there were more secrets about Clary, and Clary herself felt like she hasn't recovered all her memories. That was annoying. What else could there be? I don't like the story being dragged on with fillers. I feel like that is what the next book will bring. Also, one thing that really ruined the ending of this novel for me was the doubts about Clary and Jace being together. Clary remember the witch Dorothea predicting that Jace would fall in love with the wrong person. That was just stupid. So after everything that happened and all that weird incest stuff, Clary and Jace are still not really a sure thing. I hated that. I am wondering what route this series will be going, and unfortunately I feel like it's going downhill if Clary is the wrong person that Jace fell in love with. I would hate it if there were new romantic interests for them in the continuation of the story. That sucks and that is mostly why I gave this 3 stars. The ending ruined it for me. I feel like the story should have ended with this very book and not with gloomy foreshadowing.owing.
B004BCT2HU|5|LOVE David Garrett and this DVD is great.  Saw him in concert last year.  What a heart throb and so talented!
6305363668|4|Based on the little known Philip K Dick book \\"Do androids dream of electric sheep?\\" from the 1960's this is one of Ridley Scotts earliest and probably best outings. Harrison Ford plays a futuristic Philip Marlowe type character, hired to track down some runaway and villainous human cyborgs. A moody and dark picture, it captures a pretty bleak image of the future, but carries some touching sentiments about the endearing qualities and failures of human beings, and the films climax is both touching and memorable. Initially a little disjointed at the beginning of the picture, and at times surreal in directorial quality it is nonetheless an exceptional movie, with an excellent script, and cast - Sean Young plays the very beautiful romantic interest, and there are also some early outings for Daryl Hannah, and Rutgar Hauer. Although the Sfx are somewhat behind today's computer aided wonders, the fact remains that this is a very well made and believable movie. As if this weren't recommendation enough the film also contains a stunning soundtrack by Vangelis, which was not actually released until recently. There are several versions available including wide screen and DVD but be warned however this more recent \\"Directors Cut\\" release was actually a bad idea, cutting Fords talkovers, and leaving more questions than it set out to answer from the original movie. One of the best Science Fiction Films of the last 20 years.
B00ALKO9WE|2|The Giver started of well and I loved the concept, however about half way through the book I felt like Author didn't know what direction to take and started to lose interest.  The finish was disappointing and left me feeling like I was missing the last chapter.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book saved literature for me. It's witty and fun, but also achingly beautiful. It's a love story that reminds us that heartbreak and love are often the same entanglement.
B006885LZM|5|Outstanding presentation of the marines fighting in the Pacific during WWII.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun game.  I love puzzles so this is right up my alley.  Great game to keep your brain young!  Fun!
B0029LCJJS|4|This series is well written and generally follows history fairly.  Characters are well developed and you identify with some of them and regret their beheading.  It shows the moral bankruptcy of the crown, catholic church and people of the era  If you tend toward libritarianism you are reminded why you dislike government.  I would rate it higher but it really is just soft porn.

B000006TRV|5|Well, well, well ... I finally broke down and listened to this album with an open mind and I must say that I am amazed.  My first exposure to these guys was the movie of the same title.  After watching that movie, my idea  of them was &quot;Those guys are crazy!&quot;  So I gave up on ever  actually listening to them after that.  This was about 6 yrs. ago and I  regret my shallow misconception of a decision now.  I'm going to try to  watch that wierd movie again and maybe I'll appreciate it more now.  This  album is basically the journey through the mind of an honest man caught in  a deceitful world.  It paints a picture that is full of emotion.  I've  declared that the song &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is the best on the  album and works well with any mood you could possibly be in while listening  to it.  This album has something for everyone.  I can't really define it as  a rock album because it has a lot of contemporary and &quot;pop-like&quot;  tracks on it.  My advice is to just buy it because how can all those people  be wrong?
B000002NJS|5|this is truly one of the best albums of all time. All the singles released have been good, but you gotta get this classic album!
B00A6CCF0K|5|Not as scary, but every bit as good as the first book!! Mr. King, you never disappoint! I Loved it!
B009WJ14FA|5|This disc plays very well, but it sounds as though this is one of those bands you want to see live, preferably in some small roadhouse.  There is a good amount of new R&B out there that borrows a lot of sound from the past and Vintage Trouble joins that from the more hard-rockin' blues side of the tracks than most.  Not every song is a &#34;5 star&#34; but a very good effort overall and worth the purchase.
B0042FZWC0|5|After concluding a 25 year military career, I felt stagnant, resting on my laurels. I did not want to live the second half of my life looking back at the &#34;Best Years of my life&#34;. This book and $100 Start-Up serve to be a kick in the pants as I look to define v2.0 of my Life.
B00005QCYC|5|This DVD set is an excellent opportunity to obtain the three movies inexpensively and with a free bonus disc of special features. The trilogy is terrific fun, with some of the most groundbreaking SFX you are likely to ever see, and an infectious sense of wonder and adventure. All three movies have had mixed reviews, but like the Die Hard series they are all different and strong movies in their own right. Personally, I like the second film the best - it gets straight into the action and never lets up, is more hard edged and genuinely scary than the other two, devotes more screen time to the wonderfully sardonic Jeff Goldblum, and is a real rollercoaster ride. The first film is almost as good, and will always be a favourite of mine since I will never forget seeing the T-rex for the first time at the movie theater and being awestruck (I still am). I think it takes too long to get going and to explain the premise, but once it picks it up, it is relentless. The third movie misses Spielberg's touch (he allowed Joe Johnston his dream to direct a JP sequel) and is far too short, but is an enjoyably straight forward action picture, if a little too similar to the first (down to the return of Sam Neill). With some great extras (documentaries, SFX featurettes, trailers, interviews etc) that actually may increase your knowledge of all things dinosaur and SFX, and a DTS mix for the third flick, this is a great set (almost as good as the Die Hard set) that is indispensable if you love the movies. And finally, the picture and sound on each disc is top notch too.
B007J4T2G8|5|I have never read an erotic novel until this series.  At first I was turned off by the s&m talk about the book and it took me a few weeks before curiosity got the best of me.  I am so glad I picked these up on amazon. This story is an ultimate love story about courage, love, sex and fantasy. This trilogy is a must read!!
0671015206|4|I have just started this and I enjoy it so far and I am hoping to learn a lot from it.
B000068TPN|4|I rarely bother to watch any Nam movies for a variety of reasons.  Mostly because I was there and none of them are really a good depiction of what it was like or what went on.  But this one was highly recommended to me by some other Nam vets so I gave it a try.  Yes.  They pretty near just about got it right.  Including the parts about cab drivers delivering telegrams to widows who didn't know they were!  I suppose the impact on the soilders' families is a big part of why this movie tells more of the real story than any of the others have.  It's not the usual action/adventure story that others have produced.  Want to get a much better idea of what it was like?  Watch this one.
B009R5GR1K|5|Terrific for anybody who loves words, where they come from, how to say them, how to spell them, what they mean and how to play with them. Great app!
B000268QB2|3|This is not normally my type of album at all. I mean I enjoy the occasional piano-driven rock/pop band from time to time. Ok well really just Ben Folds (and, I suppose, Muse if you want to count them) now that I think of it. Its not that I don't enjoy piano in my rock bands, its just that they tend to sound the same to me, and remind me of Billy Joel, who for a variety of reasons I can't stand.<br />These guys are a piano band. They have no guitarist, and therefore... no guitars. Bands with no guitars do not tend to spend time in my cd player.  After all, no guitars tends to equate with pop music, in my mind, and generally speaking I don't like pop music.<br />So what does this band have? Well for one thing, an amazing vocalist. He might have a better voice than the lead singers of either Muse or the Darkness. Maybe not quite the same range as either, but on some tracks he really does remind me of Freddie Mercury, not in his high notes (like Hawkins) but more in the way his voice is so full and commanding, the way it holds your attention. The band fills out their sound with some electronic touches. They sound somewhat similar, I suppose, to Coldplay or Travis, two bands I like, but hate to admit that I like... bands on the edge between being rock bands and being pure pop musicians. Sorry to Coldplay fans if they find that offensive.<br />I guess add these guys to the list. They make those sort of songs that bridge the gap between rock and pop music... which I guess to me means they make songs of substance, even if the lyrics, in the hands of a lesser band, would remind you of a cheesy pop star love ballad (and yes, thats why I think people say they remind them of Coldplay... read the lyrics to The Scientist and tell me those aren't pop vocals...)<br />Regardless, don't expect to rock out to this cd in your car, but its enjoyable counter-programming when you start to tire of all the retro/garage/new wave bands that you've been listening to. At least, thats what it isfor me.<br />The two tracks that stood out the most are definitely track one and track six, and those two tracks alone are good enough to buy this cd.  Hopefully next time out, though, the rest of the songs will be of the same quality.
B0013FFMOK|3|but a good 3, so let's say 3&1/2.    Agreed with most reviews which state that the 1st hour was good but then it gradually deteriorates.     So here's my list of problems with the plot:    How a cure for cancer became an airborne virus is not explained.    Why is Neville immune? He must know because he is making the anti-virus.    The zombie/vampire creatures are made out to be exceptionally stupid, but for stupid creatures they show some great signs of intelligence towards the end. Like:  laying a trap for Neville, which he falls for and ends up hanging from a rope.  climbing a lamppost in order to flatten his car.    Samatha's death - why did he not inject Sam with the cure that he knew worked on a rat, and ultimately worked on humans?    The woman and her son - they just appear out of nowhere with little explanation of how they survived the chaos. They bring a message to the movie that I have not seen revealed .. which is 'Human's screwed up and nearly wiped out their species, but god is finding a way to help the human race survive. She is a messenger from god, how else could she have found a human colony in Vermont?    Finally, the colony walls - what's the stop the creatures from scaling them?    Les.
B009NNCHGU|3|Such a GREAT movie! GREAT dancing :)
B00466HN6S|5|I really was expecting something funnier. The trailers had most of the funny stuff. I mean is was okay but it could have been so much more.
B0030IIZ4M|5|An instant Disney classic, featuring the humor of Tim Allen & Tom hanks! My granddaughter loves it!
B004ZH66XO|5|it an easy past time game that is callmig. you dont have to touch your screen. you tilt your device. fun. family approved (i think that anyway).

B000UX6THK|1|All those fans who waited patiently since 2001 when Season 1 came out without the Pilot.  And who bought Season 2 when that came out.  And bought Fire Come Walk with Me.  It's okay they love it so much they will spend their hard earned money during the Great Recession to get it all again simply to get the Pilot.  And the recording and movie industry wonders why people use bit torrent.  Idiots.  Don't reinforce bad behavior.  Don't buy this set.
B009XPGJYY|5|Great show!
B00FRQ32N4|5|This game is really good it has all the robots that was in the movie and even some added robots to have more fun you should really get this game<br /><br />This game is really fun they have all the robots from the movie and some added one for fun. You should really get this game.
B00634GHJA|4|Finally able to transfer my photos and videos on my Samsung S3 and S4. I received errors every time I tried to connect my phone directly through my USB to the computer. I researched the error online and found many of the exact same complaints, but not real solutions. I contacted Samsung who had me try one of their programs which also did not work.<br /><br />App is fairly easy to use. It takes a little time due to transferring over the network. I wish there was a USB option. Make sure to use the desktop app - it makes transfer easier.
B000YHG72E|5|Best Christmas movie ever! Epic!
B000S1M9LY|5|The only drawback to reading the novel has been the weightiness, and the need for two bookmarks while looking up the hilarious footnotes. With the price of the eBook under $5, there's no reason not to own one of the best books of the 20th century!
B002G1YPH0|5|I bought this cooler alongside with my latest rig that includes an AMD Phenom XT1090 six cores processor and istalled it from scratch so I can not tell the diference between the original cooler and this but I can tell the temperature of the cpu never goes hotter than 35 deg celsius, and I don't think I had ever heard the fan going over 1000 rpm so you just don't hear it at all.  CPU's cool, no buzzing around my ears, I'm happy. Instalation was a bit tricky but google how to video and you do it in 5 minutes. Great buy.
B007J4T2G8|2|This book is the xxxxxx-rated version of Pretty Woman.. it appears that the author is stuck on it's pwn  personal sexual insecurities . I never read such filth in my life... but I guess in today's society... that is what sells...Sex... and they wonder why we have problems with some of the young folks in this society...
B005HSL626|2|They rewind the game with the new updates blades have powers,leveling up,STARFRUIT,it's just dumb I loved the game before the updates, but the blades are pretty cool although I would NOT play this game ever again!
B000FZETIO|5|\\"Pretty in Pink\\" has always been a family favorite and this copy doesn't disappoint.  It's perfect!
B009XIXVU6|5|Beautiful writing.  Poignant story that grabs the reader throughout the book.  Loved Hosseini's past books as well.  Read it in three days and have to read it again.
B00CU0UE0E|5|I PREVIEWED THE ALBUM AWHILE AGO, AND I KNEW I LIKED IT, BUT NOW THAT I BOUGHT IT I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT. DEFINATELY WORTH SPENDING YOUR MONEY. GREAT POP ALBUM.

B004FOA84A|4|I'm at the globe and cant figure out the code....iv been to the study; found the poster but still no luck figuring it out.
B005USZML4|5|I liked the book a lot. Edge of seat read. Everyone should read this great book. Ages 8 and up.
B00QR7ZM8A|1|For me as actogenarian it was GREAT!
B004Y1WCDE|1|Horrible app, used it on the new Fire Stick.<br /><br />Plex content stutters consistently unless the Fire Stick is right next to the WAP. Other apps work fine on the Fire Stick.<br /><br />Secondly, about once every 2-3 times, when I access Plex, I have to manually refresh to see my libraries. This is without any network interruption from the Fire Stick.<br /><br />Very disappointed, especially for $4.99 when I already have Plex Pass.
B000QCS8TW|5|I'm just getting into this genre , I've never seen the show but wanted to know what all the hype was about ....let me say this book was great !!!!!!!!
B008XG1X18|5|Love it, so many great party &amp; craft ideas, plus some yummy recipes, etc.  I really love the DIY's for the home too. I really like having one place that holds all my recipes, DIY's, etc.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Loved this book and the whole series! Can't wait for the next movie to come out! Read all three books in three days. Couldnt put them down.
B00HXYKYIE|5|Anyone who has seen an elephant. Or has wondered about these wonderful beings,will be struck how this author weaves a magical tale around the lives of women,their children, elephants and their calves--- masterful writing
B000005HN6|5|Opeth has done it again! The seven song cd is nothing but pure blis. Each song progresses from one hellishly divine chord to the next, then with two instrumental scustic tracks, it sets the perfect mood for any situation.  The vocals, guitar progressions and extensively wonderful percusion with  double peddled bass drum gives this cd the greatest of possible sound.
B00F8L2VO4|5|love how fun it makes learning.
B003O86FMW|5|The first few chapters may seem a little slow, but press on and keep reading, you won't regret it. After finishing this book I had to instantly download \\"Mocking Jay\\". Love, love, love the entire series.

B007PT3QOQ|5|I loved this game as a kid, and love it even more as an adult.  I am so addicted to this game.  It has great graphics and I like the fact that I can move the buildings and people around as my town grows.  One minor disappointment is that some of the challenges require you to actually purchase things.  I wish that you could bypass those challenges so that they disappear from the list.
B003O86FMW|5|This book was so good. I would recommend this book to almost anyone. If you are looking for a book you can't put down this is one
1616550414|5|I was amazed when a I first saw the book, with those golden details and the texture. I liked every detail of it, you'll love it if you are a fan of the Zelda franchise like me.
B004MC8CA2|5|This app comes in very handy at Bible classes, discussing with others outside of Bible classes, discussing a certain scripture and proving you're right at that moment, instead of having to get back to them. Everyone doesn't carry their Bible with them, having this on my Kindle is convenient because I am always bringing scripture up in my daily life with others outside of my home I love it.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|we love Amazon fire TV with Prime video quality is the best
B0064X7FVE|1|I used to use TWC's app several times a day, every day. When this upgrade came out, it was a disaster. I have stopped using the app as it is confusing, difficult to navigate, it has lost features, and they added some ridiculous points and achievements thing where they want to sucker you in to doing tasks. DELETED. Please bring back the old version!!! There was nothing wrong with it!!
B00AIBZJLG|5|Having seen the movie on the big screen and loving every moment of it, I couldnt resist to have a copy to watch at home.<br />We are amazed on how well it looks on the small screen. It is a great story, and the Cirque Du Soleil never cease to amaze. What will they produce next ? We can hardly wait !......
B00IRISI42|5|Baldacci has created characters in John Puller, his brother and father, and has woven them into an interesting and intriguing military family.  Baldacci's tales are both entertaining, exciting and also have a cliff hanger effect.  You wonder what is going to happen with each turn of the page.  I am looking forward to book 4.
0812415086|5|I got this for my 88 year old mother and she loves it. She like to read it over and over again.
B00APUYWYA|4|The movie kept me laughing throughout. Perfect movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon on the couch at home. good work.
B000CC3SDW|5|Simply an outstanding recording.  I'm not a huge classical music genre fan, but good musicians like Yo-Yo Ma can sway you into enjoying it in no time.  Ok, these are songs from movies, but they're not Metallica or Rush (yes, I like those groups).  SACD sound is much more detailed and nuanced than regular CD quality too.
B0083SBJXS|5|love it a lot hanks just what i ordered and much better price then most sites have it for thanks a lot
B00GY0HJ4K|1|This game has in app purchasing which would be so bad if it didn't have a pop-up for stuff after every level.  The game itself is kind of annoying--it makes me think of an app version of tellitubbies.
B0012GTZC0|5|I'm not typically a reader of war stories because I dislike the brutality, yet romanticizing of the genre, but I've enjoyed other Ken Follet novels, so I gave this one a try and am I glad I did.  It kept me enthralled from beginning to end.
0307276902|5|I read the book and I very much enjoyed it.  I read very infrequently because usually books bore me.  Music is more my niche than reading for whatever reason.  This book however was the exact opposite.  It drew my attention so much that I neglected doing anything BUT read this book start to finish.  My mother got me this book after seeing the author James Frey on \\"Oprah\\".  It turns out that many of my friends parents got them the book.  Not a one didn't enjoy it.  I liked this so much that I am most definately getting his other book \\"My Friend Leonard\\".  Apparently its based on his friend Leonard from this book.  Im so excited!!!  Someone told me that Jame's girlfriend in the book has a book out about her life as well.  Can't find that one.  When and if i do Im not going to hesitate to get it.  This book is one of the most motivational writings i've ever read.  I highly reccomend it to everyone and anyone.  If you are an addict or alcoholic you'll find that it inspires you as well as reminds you vividly of what you dont wanna go back to.  If your not an addict or alcoholic but a family member or friend of an addict or alcoholic (i would guess that 95% of people are friends or know someone thats has this devistating disease), then your priviledged to get a front row exhibit of what alcoholisim and addiction are all about! <br /> <br />I myself am a heroin and crack addict.  Despite numerous treatments of all different varieties, I always go back.  My addiction has brought me to places out of a horror movie (physically, mentally, and emotionally).  Currently, my addiction is running rampant.  Despite offerings of rehab, meetings, and doctors, I continued to decline.  Continued until I started reading this book.  This book has motivated me more than ANYTHING I have ever encountered.  I am now a week away from entering a 6 month treatment facility.  And until then I'm gonna read Frey's next book \\"My Friend Leonard\\", and tough out the sickness.  Thanks to Frey for theseunbelievabe pages of motivation and inspiration.  And for those of you pondering getting this book.  I highly reccomend it, more than highly reccomend it.  I require it!!!
B000002W9P|4|This one stands out for many reasons: great songs like: future world or twilight of the gods, great guitarts (thanks to Kai Hansen and Michael Weikath), great new metal sound and the amazing sound of Michael Kiske voice. The only thing I can't handle yet is the Charlie Brown mention on Halloween's track. Otherwise, would be GREAT!
B000000W9Z|5|David Bowie has always been and continues to be an innovator in the music world.  This album is positively brilliant. If you skip past the segues (I find them unnecessary if not tedious) what you will hear is some classy  orchestration, fantastic vocals and lyrics to knock your socks off.   Particular favorites: I have not Been to Oxford Town, Thru These Architects  Eyes, and Strangers when We Meet. The eeriness, the moodiness, the full  body shiver comes from the material and the amazement that this man just  won't quit.
B007N85POS|5|Angry birds Rocks.<br />I really love it a lot and I never get bored..... Angry birds is my favorite past-time..
1444792474|4|Well worth the time to read. Why does Google work? They hire smart creatives, pay them well, challenge them and give them time to create in an environment that encourages collaboration. This was a good look into a culture built to succeed.  Lots of lessons here.
1905662327|5|This is a gorgeous book in every way.  The binding, the pages, the photography.  The book is huge and thick, worth way more than its price.  The pictures are great and a fascinating look through Jimmy Page's career.  He gives interesting detail and you really see his progression from child to session musician to rock God.  You see backstage and on stage, you also see his homes and the many recording studios he's been in.  He gives details about what songs he played on that were not part of the Yardbirds or Led Zeppelin.  He discusses the guitars he used throughout his career.  He even shows his passports and the extensive tour dates.  Tons of details  If you are a Jimmy Page fan, or a Led Zeppelin fan, you will love this book.
B00008DDSC|5|When I heard about this movie I was intrigued and rushed to rent it when it came out on DVD. Halfway through the movie I wasn't quite sure if I had been misled, but as soon as the sparks begin to fly for Mr. Grey and his humble secretary with a highly charged proofreading, the momentum of the movie really takes off and by the end I was left rapt and entirely satisfied by the entire experience. Men may view this film differently than women, but as one of the gals, I found some of the most intensely erotic scenes were after their first intimate \\"encounter\\" in Edwards office which concluded with heavy breathing and the slightest touching of fingers. Though the film may be quirky, it is deeply affectionate and I came away with empathy for almost all the characters in the film. Now that is a great movie!
B00992CF6W|5|Great game just wish it had horses
B001DTPZNY|1|This was a bootleggedvideo made in China. I was very disappointed in this purchase. It did not come with a receipt from who sent it so I could not sent it back or I would have. I did not intend to buy and illegal copy of the movie.
B008LFY6NI|4|I love the app except for when I played it for a little while and I exited the app I still saw a faint thing spinning in the background. Otherwise it is a very nice app.
0736092269|5|Very informative book.
B000WD66BM|5|Came across this album on Pandora, along with Edenbridge.  The eclectic combination of genres from ballad, movie, pop, rock, metal, and even opera is masterful far surpassing the simplistic music of top 100 groups heard on radio today.  The artists behind this group are truly genius.
B0089LOG02|5|Rather melodramatic, in places horrifying, but thus riviting.  A good read. Maybe not deathless prose, but<br />certainly gripping.  Dickens-like.
B000JK8OYU|5|I am, was, and always will be a Beatles Lover! To me the Beatles music is on the top of the all time music pinacle. Any and everything else starts miles below in my opinion both quality, excellence, variety and just everything in every way about music. I am  56 years old, and haved loved everything about the Beatles for over 4 decades now, with no foreseeable end to my love of this music. <br /> <br />Anyway, IF you are anything like me, I have to report the \\"new\\" album, The Beatles LOVE, is nothing short of a true masterpiece. It is created from the original masters created by the genious George Martin over 40 years ago. Him and his son, Giles, in collaboration with the creators of Cirque du Soleil, created a Cirque show from this music. (That I get to go see in a few weeks in Las Vegas) and the album collection was released last week as both a CD and a set that has a CD and an Audio DVD.  <br /> <br />The sounds, and songs are like no Beatle song you have heard, but yet are totally familiar. The mix of parts and pieces of songs, and how they transition is beyond words to describe.  <br /> <br />My only regret (WARNING HIPPIE CHILD about to speak) is that I cant listen to this stoned out of my face HAHAHAH . But alas adult responsibilities and mandatory drug testing pervade our society *sigh* <br /> <br />It is just to absolutely lose yourself in the most decadant of musical escapes. <br /> <br />The Audio DVD has a clarity, and musical layers of separation that just boggles the mind, and moves the soul. Just a tip here, IF you listen on a DVD player,  turn your tv ON and use the onscreen controls to select your audio output. I did not do this first time around and it uses the default PGM Audio. Using that, a few songs had a long pause, and even stopped at one point. Once I changed to Dolby 5.1, it not only did not do that annoying pause/stop, but the sound improved greatly! <br /> <br /> <br />OK, I must waft back down to reality now.. But seriously , IF you likethe Beatles, you will just LOVE this work of art! <br />
B004J4WKUQ|5|I really enjoyed this!  And I will encourage my kids to read it, also.  I hope to read more by this authour.

B002M7A79S|4|I watched this movie after tearing through the Firefly series on Netflix.  I found the movie a bit of a disappointment compared to the series.
1451695187|5|it was even better than I was expected. Everybody who believes in life after death should read that. he is the reall living proof of it, I believe.
B00GTCECVG|5|Fun fun and the best of my own personal information about the best movie that too lol that made  no sense
B003SOMYNQ|5|I read this book for my English class and looking at the cover I thought it might be a pretty okay story but I was definitely wrong! From the very first chapter I was captured by Lee's captivating and mysterious characters. Boo Radley, the classic camp-fire story character, reminded me of the stories I used to hear about monsters in the woods that were located near my house from the way he was portrayed as this secluded person with a strange and twisted history. The end of the story was far from what I expected because of all the plot twists. Scout, the little tomboy narrator of the story, provided the intriguing perspective of a 6-year old girl instead of the usual teen or adult point of view like in other novels. Looking through her eyes at the trial between Tom Robinson and Bob Ewell, I believe, may have let some parents who have read the story know that kids may be kids but they can still see and understand that something bad is going on. Overall I think that this is an outstanding book that everyone should read.
B009AOFNU4|2|The device itself is solid, well made, and comfortable to hold. However it has insufficient software support to be worth keeping. Unfortunately Amazon wants 8 dollars to ship it back so its not really worth returning either.
B00G5G7EXY|5|This is a great movie!  We even watch it without the grandchildren.
B00C7DGRL4|5|i LOVED THIS MOVIE . KEPT ME  ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT , SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE AWESOME , AND IT HAD  A GOOD STORY-LINE  ,
B00KMX5V8G|4|Good fun

0739376969|1|I bought the cd to go with the book that I was given for an executive leadership program for one of the largest mining companies in the world.  Same old material in a new cover when compared to other change leadership texts.
B008JMKN4Y|5|When I first bought this book I had no idea I'd be this hooked. This was an amazing love story that I just couldn't put down. I fell in love with the characters and couldn't wait to read what would happen next! I didn't want this book to end but I am looking forward to reading others by Jamie McGuire!!!!!
B001FB4W0W|5|A guilty pleasure! Just got it last night and have even watched a couple of the episodes again.  A little cheesy at times but totally worth it.  The books are awesome too and this first season is based on the first book only, \\"Dead Until Dark\\". Sooooooooo goooood!!!
B002HWRYJE|5|Awesome movie!  I'd have to rate this one right up there with Stark Trek \\"First Contact\\".
B0009X766Y|5|I don't care how many times I see this movie, every time brings immense enjoyment. Set in Chicago in the 1920s, Paul Newman and Robert Redford play two con artists who, with a gang of other pros put together by Newman, the mastermind, put a sting on a big shot Chicago gambler for a half million dollars. The story is perfect and unfolds flawlessly - it's just mysterious enough to keep us wondering while not being so much so that we can't follow it. The sets, costumes, and photography (by master Robert Surtees) are all done to perfection. Top notch entertainment from beginning to end.
B002ZG997C|5|Excellent
B008WOULPK|5|It is a substantial history and bibliography of fashion photography as well as an inspiring example of someone who is passionate about their work and creativity. Half way through, I started Google imaging all the names that were mentioned to reference the photographer, designer, editor or hairstylist to see and understand their work and contribution which added greatly to the experience, then immediately started re-reading it from the beginning to continue looking at the rest of the references. Then there are all the charming drawings, selected works, photos and an edited insider's view of the business - making for several days of creative entertainment, humor and wonder.
B00KK0PICK|1|This is awful on so many levels, but let's start with the author does not know vertical from horizontal. But, more power to her for cleaning up financially. Good job.
B0051UP5NQ|4|Overall I really like this app, and it has come in handy on many occasions. It is scaled down in functionality (which, on a phone, is to be expected), but does the job for me. My only issue is that some documents took a long time to load up for me, but once they did it worked very well.
B00Y6QF0PE|2|Just the same old stuf from book one
0470932139|5|I've only looked through it and haven't read it cover-to-cover yet but I KNOW I'm going to love it.  Great photos, great suggestions, very clear and concise -- exactly what I was hoping for.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Best book everrrrrr! It seriously made me cry at the end. I recommend this book to anyone. I love it!
B004YW4L5K|5|Neil Gaiman never ceases to amaze; a well told tale!<br />(Can't see how they'll make a movie out of it)
031606792X|3|*Spoilers ahead<br /><br />The Book<br /><br />I have to admit to being deeply disappointed in this book. If you're looking for an engaging read with an exciting plot, this isn't it. The plot skims along so shallowly, in fact, that I would recommend this as the perfect book to read when you need to concentrate on something else simultaneously. No one gets hurt, there is no angst, and everything gets wrapped up with a tidy little bow - hardly something that one needs to devote one's entire brain to reading.<br /><br />The pregnancy storyline could have been feasible, but was handled in such a ridiculous way as to be totally unbelievable. (What was she pregnant for - a couple of weeks? Come on.)  Moreover, Bella was able to miraculously skip over the whole newborn bloodlust inconvenience, showing remarkable restraint and able to move among humans immediately. Finally, Bella the Super Vampire, was able to develop her \\"superpower\\" in a matter of days, never mind that it took other vampires years, decades, or centuries, to develop theirs - if they even had one. In fact, Bella's superpower was entirely too convenient, ultimately saving the day in the showdown between the Cullens and the Volturi.<br /><br />( Now that I think about it, this is the book that should have been named Eclipse as the entire book seems to be devoted to how much stronger and better Bella is than Edward. (She's stronger, she has a better and more marketable superpower, she produces a vampire hybrid, etc.) I'm sure Ms. Meyer will write a follow-up to this book. To keep things consistent with this storyline, perhaps the next book can open with Bella and Edward in marriage counseling since Edward will undoubtedly be having feelings of inadequacy. )<br /><br />What Went Wrong?<br /><br />I suspect that Ms. Meyer is a victim of her own success. Like others, I am a die hard fan of the Twilight series. I subscribed to the RSS feed on her site so that I could be kept apprised of progress on not only the new book, but also the movie. (And I do suspect that Breaking Dawn was written in hopes of continuing the movie deal.)  Although the feed was helpful in providing updates, it was also helpful in illustrating just how out of touch Ms Meyer seems to be with her fan base.<br /><br />After visiting the site, it was obvious that Ms. Meyer has little, if any, active participation in her own site. This is a shame since she's missing a good opportunity to interact with her fans. It is run by someone named Seth, who also seems to be buying into the whole \\"Stephenie as a rock star thing.\\" There no way to contact her, or her minions, on the site. In fact, Seth says: \\"Stephenie is still much too busy to re-open her fan email or snail mail addresses. Also, I cannot forward emails. She is in the process of writing/editing multiple books, and I think we can all agree that we would rather that she spends her time writing instead of reading thousands of emails every day.\\" To Seth (and Stephenie)  I humbly suggest that maybe Ms. Meyer should look into reconnecting with her fan base - it's obvious from the reviews here that she's clearly out of touch with them.  I will leave you to draw your own conclusions after visiting the site, but my takeaway is that Ms. Meyer too busy doing promotions and living the life of a rock star to be bothered with mere mortals. (Yes, pun intended.)<br /><br />While we're on the subject of reconnecting with the fans, let's not forget the thousands, or maybe even tens of thousands, of Ebook readers Ms. Meyer and her publisher penalized for their choice of format. At the eleventh hour (August 1, I believe) the decision was made to delay the release of the ebook edition by a day because they didn't want copies being posted to the net. Meanwhile, print readers (like myself) were busy posting their first impressions, as were the audiobook listeners. Delaying the release of the ebook edition accomplished nothing, unless you count disenfranchising hundreds or thousands of fans as an accomplishment.<br /><br />In summary, my advice to Ms. Meyer is: lose the sycophants, reconnect with your fans, and stop worrying about movie deals and product tie-ins and write what comes natural.Ms. Meyer is: lose the sycophants, reconnect with your fans, and stop worrying about movie deals and product tie-ins and write what comes natural.
B00785P2QC|5|it is. a good game that anyone and everyone will love. it does not mater about how old you are
B00013M6NK|5|The real thing as opposed to the many fakes you find online.  I have had several of the fakes and they swelled up, very scary.  This arrived already charged.  I have two batteries and charge one while using the other.  Nikon's products tend to be very fine.
B00CQHZ2LW|5|Just as described. They are little figurines.
B009LDD1X0|5|Love this show!
0316666343|5|This is a great book that grabs you by the collar from the first page.  The author does a magnificent job of writing in a 14 year old's voice.  Everything she says sounds exactly like you would expect an actual 14 year old to sound.  The book is haunting, but somehow funny and endearing.  I loved this book and highly recommend it.
B00EJOCAYW|5|He's 8 and an experienced Lego builder.  The pieces look really small to me, but he didn't have a problem with it.  He has another Minecraft set also and had been wanting this one.  Minecraft Lego's are next to impossible to find stocked in the stores, so it was nice to get this set at the going rate price.  He was overjoyed when he opened this present at his birthday.
0767802519|5|Love Natalie Portman in this film!
147676459X|5|This is one of the best things I've spent money on all year. Allie is a genius. I must look crazy reading this on the train - constantly laughing out loud. If you're bothering to read this, do yourself and the world a favor and buy this book right now.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I was a little concerned because others have complained that the chromecast either does not work with ATT U-verse or requires that UPNP be turned on. I had no such problem. It worked right out the box. I hooked it up to my TV and used my U-verse cable box to provide power through the USB plug. Both Netflix and Youtube worked perfectly. The Cromecast does get quite warm but the instructions tell you it does and that apparently is normal.<br /><br />I might buy another Chromecast so I can have one on each of my TV's.
B008NW67E0|5|...so maybe I'm a bit biased to like this album more, but it really is just so good. It has more of a positive outlook than the last album, with no limited use of the banjo and terrific lyrics. The flow of this album is so great. It starts off as energetic, then slows down a bit for a few tunes, then right back up again for the end. It's hard to find albums that you can listen through continuously like this one.<br /><br />Just fyi though my cd came in a flip-book type of cover, and not in a plastic cd case. It felt more like a 70s record than a modern day cd. Not a bad thing and it doesn't bring the rating down any stars, just an observation.
B004DHAC04|3|This movie about British heroism was released in the shadow of the coming World War II.  There are, therefore, two ways to watch it.  1.  The first way is to say that it is racist, jingoistic, and full of old-fashioned and out-of-favor ideas about men and heroism.  You would be right.  If you got past that, you could say it was totally unbelievable.  You would be right again, although so was the book.  Finally, if you are concerned about animals, then there are some disturbing scenes because the SPCA was not around.<br />  2.  The second way is to enjoy it for what it is.  A boy's adventure story with beautiful scenery and fine acting.  It also had a few jokes at its own expense.  It must be said, however, that it starts slowly even for 1939 and the pace never matches the current frenetic pace of current action-adventure-superhero movies of today.  Still, I enjoyed seeing a movie I remembered from childhood one more time.
B000JQU1VS|4|Hadn't read this since a child.  Still worth a re-read of this old classic.
B00A2DIW3C|5|This is a book teachers should have smart high school seniors read to encourage them to become engineers.  There is humor and adventure, all told against the background of just how important math and experimentation are in building truly innovative projects.  Ben Rich writes a great book and made it even better by allowing &#34;other voices&#34; an opportunity to add their own view of the events Ben Rich mentions.
B00RGQ4674|1|Save your money. This DVD set was not worth the money. Only two extras, no deleted scenes, etc. And the DVD skipped. I am returning.
B00MO21WAY|1|IT WAS  WRONG, COULDN'T PLAY IN AUSTRALIA........ PITY AS I LOVE THE SERIES.
B001KVZ6FW|5|Very good
B00GPWEPZ8|5|Great performances and a compelling story. A shame it did not do better in theaters. While I normally do not like constant flashbacks, they work on this film.
B00499NHLC|5|I really enjoy this series! Of the recent remakes, it is my favorite. Benedict does a fabulous job with Holmes.
B0013FSL3E|5|this is one of the greats that should be in everyone's collection. heartwarming with a very inspiring message that still rings true today and that young viewers could learn from.
B0027CNFR4|2|I loved Bridget Jones Diary, but could barely stand to watch this sequel.  At first, I could understand Bridget's insecurities, but she became so thoroughly unlikable, I found myself wishing I wasn't watching.  This movie seemed to be undoing all that I enjoyed about the first movie.  In the first movie, I felt for Bridget during the awkward, humiliating moments.  Here, it felt overdone without the spirit of the first movie, and Bridget herself seemed as shallow as Daniel Cleaver much of the time.<br /><br />There were parts that I did enjoy, particularly around Darcy, but instead of rooting for Bridget like I did in the first, I found myself saying, 'How can he like this awful mess of a woman?'  'He's an idiot for wanting this faithless psycho'.<br /><br />I do wish I hadn't seen it because it does cause a pall on the first movie.  Knowing this comes after they finally get together, I want to say 'Run Darcy Run!'  I'm going to try to pretend like this never happened so I can just enjoy the first movie whenever I re-watch it.  It's not the worse movie I've ever seen by a long shot, but I do hate how it makes me feel about Bridget when I did enjoy her so much in the original.
B004SIP7F8|5|Dazzling performances by the actors in this movie, combined with a tragic compelling story, haunting music and evocative scenery combine to make this an unforgettable film.  I tried reading the book years ago and didn't understand it.  This movie made everything clear.  The relationship between Ralph Fienne's character and Kristin Scott Thomas's character was riveting.  Passion, heartbreak and tragedy against the senseless backdrop of the war shows the heartache and unspeakable loss in human history.  A film in which everything emanates quality. Most films can't live up to the novel on which they are based.  This may be one film that does.
B004FOA84A|5|I like this point and click style game of puzzles and storyline and wish there were more like it. This game was a bit short, but thoroughly enjoyable.
0553582038|4|I just finished this fourth book, the 5th is on the way (can't wait!). I'm coming to this series late after first watching the HBO series, and I was instantly hooked. I devoured those first three books. The second and third in particular were amazing. This is now my favorite fantasy series behind LOTR.  I give this book a solid 4 stars. It was a little dry in parts, but always engaging. I still found myself flying through chapters to see what happens next. I couldn't put this down until 3:30 a.m. last night, after a full day of reading.  Some of the chapters seem superfluous, but they are always interesting. This is a wonderful fantasy world Martin created. This series is EPIC.
B003G4W49C|5|You need to read this book then STOP.  The other books in the series are nowhere near as good.  But read this one.  Orson Scott Card's best work.
B005ZMUQCK|4|My children love this movie and it is so nice to have a digital copy of it so they can watch it anywhere! The only complaint is that sometimes it stops right in the middle and then we have to restart it and fast forward to where we were. This might be a problem with the Bluray player that we are playing it on, but it seems to only be a problem with the amazon movies that we watch. It doesn't happen that frequently, and it hasn't happened when we watch it on a computer so I am thinking it might be a problem with the bluray playing amazon. not sure. But I will continue to buy my kids movies on amazon because it is so convenient, and again it doesn't happen that often.
0792839749|5|My kid watches this movie at least 2 times a day, and has been doing that for the past 3 months. Great thing about this movie is that even we do not get bored and watch it every time whole heartedly along with our kid. I can only imagine how my kid must be feeling about the flying car, nifty gadgets and of course the child catcher. My kid just runs around the room jumping whenever the child catcher comes. A Truly Scrumptious movie!
0547258305|5|I will say this book caught me by surprise. I have had this on my books to read list for a while but never got around to it. Well I finally decided to read it and boy was I happy I did. I could not put this book down. Seriously I got so caught up in it I stayed up reading all night! It was such a unique story that I was so enthralled by. I also loved Katsa because she was a strong female lead (but also very stubborn and not always logical). I will say for a young adult book it does deal with some heavy topics at times. Just with discreet sex scenes or verbal abuse to women. But these elements were not a focal point of the book and they were in reflection of the time this story took place. Overall this was such a great read. I will say that I was thrown by the ending but I didn't find it bad just unexpected. This was such a great read and one of the few books I could whole heartedly recommend to people.
B00HA8WNZ0|5|The patterns are always fluid, but never the same - this is a brain teaser that will keep you busy for hours and hours.
B005SAP45I|4|My grandson loves this almost as much as the first movie.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|New family favorite!
B00HV8TN7K|3|Alright.  Just a little tedious at times.
B00OGTDZP8|5|This was a great book. It is a small view into the life of Grace and Ryosuke, living as an interracial couple and all the great (and not so great) things they experience. It is written in a fun and very approachable manner, as the comics easily convey more complex ideas. I'm a lover of all things Japan, so this is a wonderful read for me and anyone else that wants to know more about Japanese culture. All through the eyes of a Texan married to a Japanese man. とてもすごいです！ ありがとうございます！
B008JFUUIA|4|Loved the movie!<br />Movie worked well and didn't stutter or anything, but the DVD case was completely destroyed. The case came within the usual plastic DVD case wrapped in shrink wrap. The DVD plastic case it a very shoddily made one. It is a thin plastic and bents easily, the case was actually bent slightly when I received it as it has yet to fix itself even when I place it squeezed among the rest of my DVDs. I am happy with the movie, but not happy with the packaging, and not happy that the image on the actual DVD disc was distorted. not sure if it's the manufacturer or the seller.
B00BMT9C84|5|Very real to life and very funny.  Great story line delivered by two excellent actors.
B00584UD32|5|[[ASIN:B00584UD32 Kind Of Blue (K2 HD Master)]]  It's only once in a great while, that we see and hear from a musician possessing such great talent.

B00AHTYI5M|5|This was a great movie!  I really loved it.  The acting was completely convincing.  The story was so tense and, at the same time, patriotic.  I felt this was a very good historic event told at a time of historic long drawn out misery.  Many thanks to Canada,  What a great neighbor!
B00IKZX1ZI|5|I'm not really into games but this one is fun and I am really enjoying it. Love Frozen the movie and Love this too!
B00I0O9QJY|5|I am a Kylie fan and have been for a long time.  With switching her labels I was worried that the true beauty that is Kylie would be lost.  That fear was unfounded.  Once again, Kylie delivers a true toe-tapping dance album true to herself.  From the early release of Into the Blue we witnessed Kylie's return with anticipation for what else would be on the album.  The &#34;snippet preview&#34; released before the album's full release did not do justice to the songs on the album.<br /><br />My personal favorite on the album is If Only, but it is only slightly my favorite as the all the sounds on the album are true Kylie treats.  My least favorite song is the over processed Beautiful duet with Enrique, but even that song, once you listen to the whole thing isn't too bad.  Here's hoping in true Kylie form that song gets a good once over by the DJs and they come out with a stylized dance version to do it justice.<br /><br />Will this album be my ultimate favorite Kylie CD ever?  Probably not.  Is it an album I will listen to over and over along with the others?  Definitely!
B00AEFY0F2|5|Great movie! great price. Always loved this movie and now got it on blue-ray. The picture quality is great & you can't beat the price.
B00CL0J99K|4|What a great change of pace for superhero movies, the best Iron Man movie since IM1, this movie took a couple of great unexpected twists and turns and was much better than the second in the series.

0782008372|2|I don't understand why this was given a 4.5 on         quality. It's terrible. It was the first disc I bought after I got the player and I thought my new DVD player had a problem. And the disc is not 141 minutes,  it's 116 minutes. I loved the movie, but my VHS copy is just as good as  this.
B004XC5LP0|5|Received the copy in great condition and it played perfectly.
0446528056|5|First and foremost, I want to mention that this is the best Nicholas Sparks novel to date. YOu care about the two main characters, John and Savannah, but you also care about the surroundings of the two characters.<br /><br />The reader comes to love and understand John's dad, doomed, yet the reader feels it will happen, but when it does, you cry anyway.<br /><br />It is the novel by Sparks with the most twists in it, and the ending is happy, just not like the rest of his novels.<br /><br />It is brilliantly written, and very heart-tugging. It is my favorite Sparks novel. I loved it, and the ending is amazing, yet very lovely.
0804178755|1|Love the series, have read all of them.  They are fabulous.  Not this one.  Terrible terrible terrible.  I can't believe Lee Child wrote it. It is so utterly unlike all the others.

B00005N6KG|5|If you like something that is very lightweight, sounds very good, and you cannot stand to have those stupid in your ear things that pass only fallout you will like these headphones.  It looks to me like Sony is phasing them out so I bought a half a dozen pair to last me for the next 20 years.<br /><br />I wish Sony would make these headphones with a microphone so I could use them with my cell phone as well.
B009LQKHIO|4|Good read. Will read more. Unrealistic Innkeeper description. Interesting family. Iain is the most complex. Didn't like that Todd was not in love with Sara.
B008JFUN50|4|I fell in love with Neill Blomkamp's first film \\"District 9\\"; the South African filmmaker's take on a sci-fi film was really brilliant and shows how a filmmaker with a unique storytelling voice can create something new and exciting. It was an eye-opening experience and even more remarkable because it was the filmmaker's first full-length feature.<br /><br />His second film \\"Elysium\\" is not quite as ground-breaking or original, but it does add a unique voice, making it a more interesting sci-fi film. In a less talented director's hands, \\"Elysium\\" would be a routine sci-fi programmer, the type of film quickly forgotten and relegated to endless cable runs. But Blomkamp's vision and style help ensure that \\"Elysium\\" will be remembered as a highlight of the summer.<br /><br />Los Angeles in 2154 is an overpopulated, toxicly polluted, dry and brown landscape in which people toil at meaningless jobs and struggle to survive. Yes, I said 2154 and not 2013. The working class is essentially stuck on Earth in what is a police state. The rich and wealthy live on a space station that looks like Beverly Hills and comes complete with machines able to heal any sickness or ailment. The people on Earth make attempts to board Elysium, to take advantage of the healing machines, but Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the head of Defense, quickly orders these errant spaceships shot down. Back on Earth, Max (Matt Damon) gets involved in an accident at work and becomes irradiated. He soon learns he has five days to live. Struggling to figure out how to survive, he meets mercenaries who offer to help him; they will strap a metal framework to his body and use intelligence stolen from Carlyle (William Fichtner) to get past Elysium's security network. As Max struggles with these preparations (the framework is physically attached to his body), he reconnects with Frey (Alice Braga), a girl he grew up with in an orphanage. She now has a daughter who is sick and about to die, giving Max even more reason to get to Elysium. But Delacourt also has a rogue warrior, Kruger (Sharlito Copley), in her pocket and enlists him to stop Max and help her restore order.<br /><br />Written and directed by Blomkamp, the narrative of \\"Elysium\\" is presented in an economical way, which keeps the story moving and holds your interest. There is a very brief intro before we watch an unauthorized shuttle approach the space station. We watch Delacourt go into action and then focus on Max back on Earth. Max labors through every day, much like the other people living in Los Angeles, but he does what he has to do and tries to remain positive about everything. We quickly learn about his living situation, his job, what life is like in this Los Angeles. It isn't great. A lot of sci-fi films run over two hours and this is usually attributed to the set-up and backstory necessary to get us involved in the story. Blomkamp doesn't stop the narrative to give us details, he gives us the details as part of the narrative. It is so much more engaging to learn these things as the story unfolds - because so much is happening, we pay closer attention and enjoy the finer points of this filmmaker's work.<br /><br />Max lives in a little shack in the middle of an even more run-down part of town. This is the part of town run by Spider (Wagner Moura), the man behind constant attempts to get sick people up to Elysium for treatment. He finally comes up with a plan and Max is the key. But Max is a reluctant hero and takes some convincing. When he decides to help Spider out, the process proves to be painful, continuously forcing Max to prove his determination to help. Watching Max's journey also propels us further into his universe and life.<br /><br />There are a lot of things going on in \\"Elysium\\". Spider wants to get sick people to the space station, to receive treatment. This is a driving force in his life. But he also wants to get people up there - any people - to help break the exclusivity of this place, to smash the class barrier. He uses one obsession as a mask for another.<br /><br />Matt Damon's Max is an interesting reluctant hero. Max seems happy to be just surviving. In fact, after he has an accident and work and receives a dire prognosis, his desire to continue living drives him to take the next steps to help Spider and become part of his team. Throughout the journey we share with Max, we learn about him and his view of life, we see a few moments he shared with Frey when they were kids, moments that foreshadow who they will both become. It is a surprisingly complex character and Damon brings a lot to the role.<br /><br />Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, the head of security for Elysium. She is a steely woman who doesn't seem to think twice about ordering a shuttle of Earth refugees shot down before it reaches Elysium. Her focus is to keep the people of Elysium safe and her focus never wavers. Even when the President questions her and threatens to reprimand her, she seems to consider these to be minor inconveniences and continues forward with her duties, never missing a step. In fact, the threat of a reprimand only serves to make her take the next step in her plan.<br /><br />Sharlito Copley plays Kruger, a mercenary under the thumb of Delacourt, willing and able to do whatever it takes to fulfill his responsibilities. Copley, the star of \\"District 9\\", adds a unique character to the film. As soon as Kruger sees the power shifting, he takes advantage of the situation to the best of his ability. And this allows Copley to really allow Kruger to become larger than life. He is almost a human version of the Terminator, pursuing his goals with an unhuman tenacity.<br /><br />The fact that the name of the space station Elysium - where all of the rich and privileged live, and where they have no worries, no sickness - is borrowed from Greek mythology adds another level of interest to the film and shows the creativity of Blomkamp. It goes back to that 'unique storyteller' thing I was talking about earlier. Let's face it, many won't get the reference - many writers and directors probably wouldn't - so when a filmmaker does, you sit up and take notice. Everyone wanted to go to the Elysium Fields, paradise, like heaven, to be with family and friends, to never get sick again. The Elysium in this film is remarkably similar to Beverly Hills - large estates, predominately white marble, lots of green spaces. The only difference is the slight curve to the landscape to reflect the curve in the space station.<br /><br />Once Max and Kruger arrive at Elysium, the film falters a bit and becomes more conventional. They battle each other, fighting to the death. It is a well-orchestrated fight, but it doesn't offer a lot of new visual material for us to savor, material that Blomkamp has already earned a reputation for.<br /><br />The entire final act falters slightly, veering very close to a routine sci-fi conclusion. This is disappointing because everything up to that point is really good, memorable and interesting.<br /><br />Blomkamp is a skilled craftsman, capable of creating a unique moviegoing experience. I hope he continues to use his skill, his voice, to create many, many more films to come.e class barrier.

B00005JOVH|2|Another name for this film might be \\"And Then There Were None\\" considering the killing off of the characters.  The thing was very short, predictable and for the first time, hokey,almost as if the actors were playing at a movie.  Once again, special effects saved the day but after the first 10 times of seeing objects (or people) turned into molecules by Jean (or was it her evil twin?) you want to say, \\"All right, we get it, she's a Class 5.\\"   <br /> <br />The logical question one might ask is why, with all of Jean's galaxy-defying powers does Magneto need an army of Mutants to seize the \\"cure\\" (ball headed aloof lad in gownlike clothing)?We descend into pure teenage angst - will the Freezer & Roane ever make it or will he find true love in the arms of walking through walls lass? Will the school go on or must they give up the daily lectures on being good little mutants? (What DO they learn at this place?)  <br /> <br />To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Amazingly, the reaction of the audience was the same as mine - Is this all there is?  The story was trite - a mutant cure is found and they will be offered a chance to become human. Alas, the cure is a young lad who permanently removes all mutant powers. The evil Magneto sees a chance to lead the Mutant world in a fight for supremacy and gathers his flock. For some reason, the President's son is a mutant although how sprouting wings like the archangle Gabriel can be considered a mutant \\"power\\" fails me. He makes a couple of quick appearances then flies into the sunset.   <br /> <br />Then again, I may be trying to find coherence where none was planned, logic where illogic reigns and continuity where all that was called for was a series of individual vignettes loosely related to each other.  Here's hoping for a better Xmen IV. <br />  <br />

B000002JOF|4|With his Mark Knophler style smoky baritone voice with a cool, mellow delivery, Chris Rea puts together a dark semi-concept album with \\"The Road To Hell\\" that flows very smoothly with some of his best material of his career. Hard to believe this is the same artist that did the 1978 hit \\"Fool (If You Think It's Over)\\" as most of his career has taken place in the U.K. with very little exposure here in the U.S. Rea's tight band cooks very well with a bluesy assault throughout \\"The Road To Hell\\". <br />Though each song is enjoyable with the usual Rea wistful sentimentality, one song that stands out for all-time for me is the fantastic, smooth \\"Texas\\". This classic track starts out with Rea's mellow voice and dialog accompanied with a very enjoyable, keen vibe-keyboard rhythm groove backdrop as he \\"talks\\" to his wife to consider moving the family to Texas. The song eventually smoothly energizes with a tight Joe Walsh-like sounding/style bluesy guitar that again flows so smooth and is absolutely awesome. The state of Texas should be proud of \\"Texas\\"!!! You will enjoy this album!!!

B0038BBA4I|5|I love good music of many sorts, from metal to classical. This is album is by FAR they greatest folk/rock I have ever heard. Even if you're not a fan of folk music, you should definitely give it a try. Every single song builds to an epic climax, has an ebb and flow, uses every instrument at its disposal to the best possible end, and you will never want to remove it from your playlist. I couldn't be happier to have it in my repertoire at last.

B00IX9UTLU|5|I liked the book I like the love story and the sequential order of the trilogy I like the characters
B00CNQ7HAU|5|The plot is kinda easy going, leading you very slowly to something that will reveal itself later on.<br />This is the exact kind of books I love to read.
B00JQHON74|5|First things first; this is an album that grows on you. I started not by not particularly minding it (good melodies, strong performances, tight production) but, with continued exposure, I ended up not wanting to hear anything else for a bit and it's been my listening matter of choice for the last week. In other words, Heaven & Earth does what a progressive rock album is meant to do: insinuate itself into your consciousness.<br /><br />H&E is also filler-free, but, if forced to pick favourites, I'd have to use finding myself involuntarily humming them as a criterion and go with The Game or A World of Our Own. To Ascend, Believe Again, Light of Ages, and Subway Walls are also standout tracks (The Game and To Ascend are on the live set list and come over very well in concert) and other three songs are good; I expect that I'll come to love them too, in a couple of days.<br /><br />Incidentally, Jon Davison is a great singer and songwriter (he wrote one song on the album and co-wrote all but one of the others). I think his voice might be slightly deeper than Jon Anderson's, based on how Jon sang Close to the Edge at Yes's DC gig, but he's got passion and control, both live and in the studio. He's very energetic on stage, too--reminiscent of Chris Robinson in his prime.
B006LSZECO|5|Great novel. Kept me reading intensely, right to the end! Loved the book club questions, that have kept me thinking beyond the reading!
030746363X|5|At first I was skeptical I'd ever read this book. After all, the flip side of all that \\"obsessive research\\" Tim Ferriss has put into this, is length and detail.    Didn't happen for a moment though; plenty of anecdotes balance out the detailed 'how to' steps and the sheer craziness of some of the self-experimentation keeps you hooked.    Given that Tim Ferriss became famous for outsourcing - it's fitting his latest book has effectively allowed me to outsource a bunch of left-field fitness-research-experimentation (that I'd never even think of, let alone do).    The best way I can think to describe the book is real life meets google analytics. For anyone who ever discovered an unexpected massive boost to results from wild experimentation and obsessive testing... with a webpage... this is the same philosophy applied to your life.
B002U3CCKQ|5|As good as Gone Girl?<br /><br />After reading and falling in love with Gone Girl, I immediately bought Flynn's other books. It actually took me over six months to even bother opening this one, for some strange reason unbeknown to me.<br />I wasted six months.<br /><br />Where the protagonist is a likeable and relatable character, she's also majorly flawed. Her past, which is revealed right away (although the details are a mystery) is dark and sinister, and I simply couldn't help but flick the pages at lightning speed. A bit of a detective story unfolds, though driven by guilt rather than a satisfying wage. I just... I love this story. I'm trying not to say too much, so as not to run my mouth and spoil it for anybody!<br /><br />I simply cannot WAIT to see the movie adaptation, but at least I have her debut novel to read until then.<br />Books like this are the reason I read.

B005GY0Y8S|4|Well written, kept you guessing as to 'who did it'.
B006TKP2B2|2|Not a very griping story.  Not sure what the author's goal was.  I thought the premise and nature of the dystopian world was not well explored soot seemed fake the whole time.  It was sort of a political book but I didn't really empathize with anyone.
B007J4T2G8|3|I would've enjoyed the book more if the author had written it better. There was no transition in-between paragraphs and sometimes I would have to go back and re-read certain sections. However, the writing started to get better in the mid section of the story.<br /><br />I didn't consider this story erotic. Yes I understand that some readers would call it erotica due to the BDSM scenes, but I didn't get stimulated by it. Although, there were certain scenes that were sensual and even a tad bit erotic but this story is more psychological than erotic. It was very emotional and I plan to continue reading the next two books.

B000002UAU|5|Writing a review about what may very well be the most influential recording of popular music ever released is a daunting task.  To make matters worse, the fact that I am a progressive rock fan and that my perspectives on this album may not necessarily be welcome in this forum make it even moreso.  Suffice it to say that I am very interested in exploring the \\"roots\\" of English progressive rock as it existed during its heyday (1971-1976), and my search \\"tree\\" took me right to Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)...well that is after I listened to (and loved) Magical Mystery Tour (1967).  Just to make things clear, I loved the Beatles as a kid in the late 1970s and even signed this album out of the local library, although I can't say that I ever really LISTENED to their music; until now that is.<br /><br />Everything that has been said about Sgt. Pepper's and its relationship with the classic progressive rock style is true.  Many of the elements of the English progressive rock style are here including eclecticism; classical form; surrealism; great arrangements; sophisticated production; and incredible melodies/harmonies.  Although the unchecked virtuosity that characterized the music of bands like Yes, ELP, and King Crimson was not in place on Sgt. Pepper's, the seeds of progressive music had been sown.  In fact, I could go out on a limb and trace out one lineage whereby: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)>Moody Blues - Days of Future Passed (1967)>King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King (1969)>Yes/Genesis/Van der Graaf Generator etc.  Of course, I might just be getting myself in trouble here.<br /><br />The lineup on this album included John Lennon (guitars, organ, piano, percussion, vocals); Paul McCartney (bass guitar, guitars, piano, mellotron, vocals); George Harrison (guitars, fuzz, mouth organ, percussion, tambourine, sitar, piano, vocals, tamboura);  Ringo Starr (drums, percussion, mouth organ, bells, piano, and vocals).  I suppose that I should add producer George Martin to the list too - the significance of his influence on this album (along with his team of engineers) can not be underestimated.<br /><br />Specifically, many of the sophisticated studio techniques used in progressive music turn up on this album including tape manipulation; tape loops; and other electronic experimental effects - nearly all of which were prepared by Martin.  In fact, it was the otherworldly sounds and studio wizardry used on Sgt. Pepper's that made musicians everywhere want to rush out and push the envelope of music even further.  Furthermore, the addition of brass, string, and woodwind sections (including a full orchestra at the end) and the rich arrangements on Sgt. Pepper's are also impressive.  This symphonic fullness was duplicated on later symphonic progressive rock albums with banks of keyboards (mostly Hammond organ, mellotron, and tons of synthesizers) in addition to guitars/bass/drums (examples: Yes - Close to the Edge (1972); Selling England by the Pound - Genesis (1973)).<br /><br />The music on Sgt. Peppers is amazing and is chock full of stunning melodies and harmonies.  There is also emotional sophistication too; for example, a track like She's Leaving Home is very sad and the plaintive vocals really convey this.  The classical influences also come to the fore on She's leaving Home and the use of an instrument like the harpsichord on a few pieces also reinforces this.  There is also a bit of humor too with McCartney's When I'm Sixty-Four, a nice track that features Paul's bouncy bass lines.  I am however, first and foremost a rock fan, so the more psychedelic rock tracks like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, and A Day in the Life are among my favorites although George Harrison's track Within You Without You is quite nice.  Within You, Without You was heavily influenced by Indian music and features tables, sitars and the like.  When taken as a whole, the very differentpieces on the album seem to flow together as a single \\"concept\\" - of course, by restating the introductory theme at the end of the album really drives this point home.  Interestingly enough, this was apparently not the original intent of the Beatles.<br /><br />This version of the CD contains all of the lyrics and some informative liner notes although it would be nice to see this incredible album remastered.  The sound quality is OK.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent album of psychedelic rock that should be considered indispensable for any music fan, whether it is progressive or otherwise.  Very highly recommended along with my personal favorite, Magical Mystery Tour (1967).  Other psychedelic rock albums that might prove enjoyable to prog rock fans exploring the roots of English prog include two by the Moody Blues (Days of Future Passed, 1967; In Search of the Lost Chord, 1968) and Pink Floyd (Piper at the Gates of Dawn, 1967; and A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968).to flow together as a single \\"concept\\" - of course, by restating the introductory theme at the end of the album really drives this point home.

Unfortunately she didn't win the earthly battle, but she left music for us to listen to that directly applies to our relationship with God.  There's not one Whitney album that doesn't have at least one song about Jesus.  This one has &#34;I Look To You&#34;, and I get teary when she sings she's not sure she's gonna make it, but still it's her prayer to the Lord.<br />RIP Whitney.

B000002UAR|5|I'm grateful for Amazon's feature of posting reviews, as it gives me this chance to tell you all about my very favorite album of all time, the Beatles' 1966 masterpiece `Revolver.' <br />The Beatles were always evolving,  from the days of collarless suits of 1962 right to the hippie days of  `Abbey Road,' 1969, and as a result, each Beatle album is a neat snapshot  of the group at a step of transformation. The snapshot known as `Revolver'  captures the Mod, paisley-shirted, granny-glassed John, Paul, George and  Ringo with only a smattering of resemblance to the Fab Four from those  black and white days of `I Want To Hold Your Hand' but on the other hand  they're not quite Sgt. Pepper and band yet. The previous album, `Rubber  Soul,' had the group embarking on some more interesting musical paths than  the albums which preceded it, but `Revolver' went even further. The sounds  were more colorful (\\"Revolver' is the most colorful album ever issued in a  black and white sleeve.)  All the songs still followed those so-called  \\"rules\\" of pop music of the day...standard verse/chorus structure, nice  melody, less than three minutes, but the Beatles were coming up with ways  of taking these old rules and putting new fire into them.  Of course, the  next step would be abolishing the rules and creating their own, but  `Revolver' succeeds by taking the norm to its limits rather than  challenging it. In short, the music is out-there, but with one foot (or  four) on the ground to keep it accessible.<br />Even if you don't own this  album yet, you are most likely already familiar with several of the songs.  Take a look at the tracklisting and note the good number of truly classic  Beatle songs, like `Yellow Submarine,' `Eleanor Rigby' `Good Day Sunshine'  `Got To Get You Into My Life,' and `Taxman.' But what's nice is that  `Revolver' is not only a highly enjoyable album by its own merits, but it's  also a good starting point if you are discovering the Beatles music for the  firsttime, as `Revolver' presents all of the things the Beatles were known  for. For example, the Beatles were known for inventive harmonies, and  tracks like `I Want To Tell You' and `Good Day Sunshine' feature some of  their best ever.  The Beatles were also known for producing fine softer  numbers, and `Here There and Everywhere' and `For No One' are two of their  best light moments of their career (of course, if you'd rather hear them  rock out, refer to `She Said She Said' and `Doctor Robert.')  If you'd like  samples of their legendary use of studio production/trickery, or something  that shows their famous psychedelic influence, you're sure to enjoy  `Tomorrow Never Knows.'  Perhaps you'd like a taste of Lennon's legendary  `other worldy' lyrics.  If so, `And Your Bird Can Sing' and `I'm Only  Sleeping' will suit you fine.  Looking for a sign of their well-documented  Eastern influence? You'll find just that in `Love You To.'  <br />The Beatles  are not the only band to tackle many musical styles in the course of a  single album, but they are one of the few that still manage to keep the  album sounding cohesive while doing so. No matter how different the styles  of music, the tracks are logically sequenced.  <br />`Revolver' is as much a  treat to the ears today as it was upon its release in August 1966.  Please  find space for it in your CD collection...and your mind.

B007SGLZP8|5|I always look forward to the \\"lawyer\\" novels.  This one did not let me down!  Can't wait for the next one.
B00C8RFS82|5|Great movie, can't wait for the sequel..
B002MQYOFW|4|The book was great, not really a dull moment, I would have liked it to go on to the reunion at home.
B00A9ET4MC|4|I liked her other books better.  There are interesting discussions  in this book, especially on the topic of Race,  What does it mean in the United States?
B0000549B0|5|Out standiing movie... Atrue classis. I just saw it preformed on broadway. Thank you for leaving it black and white
B007SYWFRM|4|everyone complains that they cant get out of the game but you easily can when you go to the options. This is a cute game. Don't pay any attention to the people who gave it one star Bc they cant figure it out.
0316017922|5|Great read
B00HMAMM52|5|I have read this book several times and very much enjoy it. A good read about the inner struggle between good and evil.
B002XMGGJM|5|A Must See ! The Best Jaime Fox ever !
B006YM9JSW|5|Best CPU in the range for the money. cant praise this enough. just wish it was a bit more affordable but thats Intel for ya.
B000E41MS6|5|Our whole family loved this Doctor Who series.  It has great story lines, well defined characters and the best Doctor/companion relationship I have ever seen.  We are really going to miss this Doctor in season 2 and wish the lovely Billie Piper would stay forever.
B00B2V66VS|4|It is really fun, but there are some things I don't like.  With all of the turns in the road, when I first started playing, made me think I was supposed to turn there.  Now, I am used to it.
B00005JO20|5|Wonderful movie it makes me feel good
1878424319|5|I like it!<br /> I don't have 13 words to say & I don't see why its mandatory to have a lot to say about MY purchases ~ either I like it or don't like it ~ why do I have to write a book?  why don't you simply put a brief description in  the headliner or summary ~ you should be trying to make it easier for clients to want to leave feedback ~ this is to much work!
B009EHDU7U|5|The best read. I loved it want a movie of now. The style of writing is disarmingly different. Highly recomend
B0009P5YXO|4|I am a fan of the old and new Doctor Who series.  The thing to keep in mind is that this is a toy, so don't expect metal parts, superb simulated sound, and such.  It's plastic with batteries and a light.  However, once you accept it for what it is, it's great!  I love just fooling around with it.  Pretending to fix people's problems with it, especially with people who have no idea what it is (confusing them like the Doctor would, and just smile and be on my way).  I use it at shows and such like people would use a lighter.  And if I ever need help seeing something in the dark, it does come in handy.    It's not the most durable thing, it's all plastic.  The UV pen works great, but keep in mind the size of it's ink well, and it's hard to get a replacement, so use it sparingly.  The sound is of course low quality, and the two sounds it makes are very hard to notice any difference (there is some if you listen to it carefully).  However, it's not that loud, so it doesn't annoy people too much.  The light itself is very good, but just don't point it at anyone's eyes (UV light).    Now, there is a little problem with it.  When I got it, it was hard to keep the thing on.  It felt like there was something keeping me from pressing the buttons down.  When I opened it up to where you put the batteries, I noticed that the plastic thing holding them is right next to the 2 buttons, and that cover was sticking up on the edge when screwed on (because the pressure caused it to bed).  What I did was carefully sand down that plastic with a small piece of sand paper(a nail file would work too) so it was level with the rest of the tube.  Then I had no problems with it.  Don't know if it was only mine, but it's an easy adjustment.    All in all for this low priced toy, I love it.  Just don't expect too much, and you will love it too.
B009LGO88E|5|Excelent accessory for monster hunter 4 ultimate.
B00008BLB8|5|Great music.  Love it!  An oldie but a goodie.  Grand Funk Railroad was one of my favorites when I was growing up!
B008JGSM6G|5|I love this game it is engaging, fun , entertaining and kept<br />Me coming back for more.
6304509162|5|I remember watching this movie on t.v. when I was a kid.  Then I rented the video one day and there were parts they didn't put on t.v.  The movie made alot more sence.   The acting in this movie by the adults and the kids  is amazing.  I can watch this movie over and over again and never get sick  of it.  That is why I am buying the movie now.  I hate all the commercials.  The only part I thought was cheesy was, when the scientist is looking in  the mirror after he throws up and starts to peel away at his face.  But for  the time it came out (1982)  even that isn't so bad.   Buy this today.   You'll love it.
B008Y6U5AM|2|It just never got off the ground.  I bit stupid with not much of a plot.
B0039Q7QKE|3|IT is what it is....no more...no less! :-D
B00RHYBGEQ|5|Definitely want to get the bonus disc on this one. I don't know how they managed to make MacArthur Park interesting but they did a great job with it. As for the regular material Morse and his band have never sounded better. They used some extra vocalists this time around and the variety helps to make the sound fresh.
B00KG2OZIU|2|From the onset, this movie never gained traction. It was more a tedious drag and definitely not a movie where you can't wait for the next scene. Perhaps the plot itself has an extremely limited market appeal or perhaps the plot in the hands of another writer or director might have enjoyed some bit of audience appreciation,or perhaps not. If you're looking for a pulse pounding &#34;Jack Bauer&#34; lead here, there just ain't one. That being said,I recognize that personal taste varies greatly from person to person so I understand that others may thoroughly enjoy it. I, for one, dozed off in the middle.
B00003CWRX|5|Wow! Al Pacino (terrific and not overacting!) and Russell Crowe (devastating performance) in a \\"based on true story\\" about the tobacco industry, \\"60-Minutes,\\" Mike Wallace (brilliantly played by Christopher Plummer and conspiracy to addict Americans.
B00A0SKFLG|4|This overall was a good movie, but with all its updated graphics and modern twists, it still wasn't as good as the original.
B00KLUMS7C|5|Love this song!!!!
B004X2M3SI|5|With season 6, the revived Doctor Who hits new heights. Some of these episodes - such as The Girl Who Waited, The God Complex and Let's Kill Hitler - are among the best in the show's 48 year history.  The opening two-parter is set in America and is complex without being overly-complicated. The finale, too, as the Doctor tries to cheat death, is brilliantly directed. In fact, that's one of the things I noticed most about this latest series: it seems like the directors are becoming much more adventurous.  Even the dodgy episodes are at least watchable. I'm thinking here of The Curse of the Black Spot, which really doesn't have much going for it, and Closing Time, which would be a nice episode were it not for the fact that it totally mis-uses the Cybermen.  Best of all, this season brings back some of the genuine emotion that I personally felt was sometimes lacking last year. Bring on season 7!
B00BWBHIUG|4|Beautiful graphics make it easy to get hooked on this one! However, when we tried to purchase the in-app for extra 'pearls', the order went through, account was charged, but the pearls never showed up on the screen. Amazon was nice enough to refund the charge, but cautioned the in-app would never be available again. Since it takes forever to build up 'pearls' for the real fun stuff without buying them, this has taken some of the joy out of the app. Hard not to give this beauty the full five stars, but that problem still rankles.
B00J0I67XM|5|Interesting backgorund story of love and commitment of a true warrior
B008JGSM6G|5|I am completely addicted to this game! It gets really fun when you're good at it and you're speeding through each level. You don't have to be good at puzzles or anything like that, which makes it an even better and funner game.
0375703764|1|Some of the comparisons touted in the PR materials for this novel are  plainly insulting. Danielewski is to Nabokov what Kenny G is to John  Coltrane. They don't even inhabit the same planet. Nabokov had to struggle  for years with rejection from american publishers, reviewers and readers.  He was a writer, not a pop star.  Danieleski, himself the brother of pop  star Poe, is a hipster with good connections that is being obscenely hyped  by the huge publicity machine of Pantheon (none other than Random House) as  the next one-hit wonderboy of the week. That's all right if you want to  consume the cool disposable coffee table book of the month, but I'm afraid  delluding oneself to believe press releases is s symptom of how &quot;pop  culture&quot; is eating whatever was left of worthy and meaninngul in  mainstream publisher's lists. HOUSE OF LEAVES is amateurish, bloated with  self-importance and as boring as it gets. It reads like what a pretentious,  self-absorbed adolescent might write. Mr.Danielewski, who had his hair  tinted to blue &quot;because he likes to frustrate people's  expectations&quot; is a product, period, and a quite lousy one at that.  Enough is enough with all this shallow glorification of the banal, the  supposedly hip and the ephimerous media dear of the second. Major  publishers are dropping the midlist, with great authors and important books  getting lost forever, in favor of peddling this fodder &quot;for modern  hipsters&quot;.  Read Nabokov, or Umberto Eco or any of the names the  publicists have appropiated for the pandering of this object. And don't  wait for the movie, wait for the Multimedia set. This time, the Emperor new  clothes come straight from the Mall.
B006PKGO40|5|Old movie used to watch it years ago fun to watch again
0385341008|4|While I really liked this book, I did find it took a while to get into the story. I gave it to my Mother to read, and she couldn't stand it and put it down half way through.
B00005JKJA|2|David Lynch, who directed this movie, IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!<br />I learned many years ago that David Lynch is very talented but that his movies are hit and miss. When I see a title by Lynch, I am intrigued but ultimately ambivalent. I recall the cinematic pleasure I received from viewing &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. However, when I recall that this is the same director who gave us &quot;Dune&quot; (the worst science fiction movie I've ever seen) and &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (had one titillating scene but was too much like watching an overly melodramatic film on acid), I have passed other films of his by.<br />&quot;Muldholland Drive&quot; was typical David Lynch from the beginning. There is a compelling (if unbelievable) plot here, but there is an eerie sense of the unknown penetrating every scene that made me question thirty times in the first fifteen minutes if I was in the mood for this crap tonight. I gave it a chance and found myself drawn in.<br />I was engrossed in this film through the first ninety minutes. Then, I accidentally turned my DVD player off while trying to stop the movie for a minute. I was irritated to find out that this DVD does not have a scene selection feature to allow you to approximate with accuracy where you had left off. I never watched the final portion.<br />I was enjoying what I saw. I would have given this film 3 STARS, but the absence of the scene selection feature on the DVD makes me lower the overall rating to 2 STARS.
B004Q7CIFI|5|While the history isn't perfect (remember, it's still a novel), it's a fun read that sucks you in from the start and keeps you going. There are moments when you'll wonder if the book is about to feel boring or repetitive, but the author doesn't disappoint.
B00ECUARO8|5|Loved it made u think. everything in the maybe had a meaning. I would recommend it to anyone. best movie we watched in a long time
B00IS87HYI|1|Its just too  hard. I have been stuck at the same level for months. I give up. Not.fun when you never advance.
B006517W3G|5|I have three records from her , an this will i rate in the middle.  It was a little unusual but nice. But it are not so good as &#34;Frank&#34;. It have a good sound and she was a exciting artist.
B005CRQ2DK|5|I love diary of a wimpy kid<br />Hilarious great to read when you want a good laugh. best book ever!
B004Y1WCDE|4|can't beat free.  if it is still free when you read this anyway.
B001IF5YLQ|5|Anyone who replaces an older computer with a new model knows the inevitable quest for adapters for existing peripherals, such as flat screen monitors.  This adapter is for a current model Mac laptop to a desktop monitor.  On Amazon, it was about $5 less expensive delivered than at the local retail store.  Like all Apple products, it worked as advertised out of the box.
B004QK5N5W|5|I love this adapter.  I use it with my iPad 2 to watch Netflix on my HD TV, and it works flawlessly.  Just like with everything else, you have to consider that you should familiarize yourself with operating the device when the HDMI cable is hooked up (the screen goes black on the device when Netflix comes up), but a little practice makes this a must have addition to a cable collection.
B00KMILO1E|1|I downloaded the app and before I could open it, I needed to update. I ran the update, but the app still was unable to open. I attempted to update twice, but it still just continues to require an update. The app doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HD.
1582701709|1|This book is so trite. The author and her \\"experts\\" repeat themselves  and probably could've summarized the book in a short paper. It shouldn't take long since it is all so made up. While plausible that we can achieve a positive atitude through our thoughts I don't believe that (the author would say thats the problem) the universe is waiting to give things to whomever asks for them.<br /><br />I believe that this a universe with a loving God and free will and if you work hard and learn what you need to achieve what you want then you will get it. Not just because you thought about it enough but because you wanted it bad enough to do the work.<br /><br />This was a waste of time as a read and I would've stopped a couple of chapter into it if I weren't reading it for a discussion group.
B003XF1XOQ|1|I loved The Hunger Games, was okay with Catching Fire, but Mockingjay was awful. Eugh. Wish I didn't read it.
B0028IDXDS|4|My 2 month old has had her \\"wubby\\" for a month now, and we love it. She's not a real oral child - hated all other pacifiers, but she enjoys her wubbanub for both sucking on & just playing with. She likes to pull on the monkey's ears.<br />It's expensive for a pacifier (why I gave it 4 stars), I wish they were cheaper so I could buy her more! But overall, we love it.
0131103628|5|The crystallised definition of &#34;the original C language&#34; preserved in a useful form for admirers and practitioners alike.<br /><br />It begins with history and origin and proceeds into a tutorial and rather thorough delineation of the language, ending with a few appendices that make it a good reference on the standard(s), practices, conventions, lexical structures and standard routines for regular users and the curious.
B00755MHV8|4|Take your doubts and fears away. Classy! Well written and you can be sure  Reid is one that walk the talk
B00GXKVZSW|5|Not sure how I missed this on broadcast tv because this type of show is right up my alley! This show is absolutely amazing and I was able to finish season 1 in about three days, it was so good and engrossing. Everything from the writing, acting, and cinematography are top notch and I can't wait to jump into season 2; would highly recommend but be warned that this show is not for the squeamish :)
B00CL8DKE2|5|OK PSB fans, this is the album that should have followed up Very.  It is easily the BEST thing they've done since.<br />The deep bass rhythms are EXQUISITE.  Crank this album UP!  You are going to be dancing despite yourself.<br />Only throw away track is 7, it is just too frantic for my tastes, but 8 and 9 are AMAZING.  Seriously folks, this disk<br />is the best electronic dance music in many, many years!!!<br />MUST HAVE for PSB FANS.<br />AMEN, and long live the Pet Shop Boys
B002KKBVTC|5|Basically an Olfa scriber that in addition carries the Tamiya logo, this is an excellent tool for scribing and rescribing panel lines or scribing a snap line for sheet plastic. Tightening the blade's thumb screw holds the blade firmly in place for clean scribing. A tab-locked flap in the handle comes with two extra blades, more can be purchased separately. I bought mine from Samurai Japan who provided quick and efficient service with secure packaging.
B005Q1W10A|5|As author of a recently published book on the evolution of vintage fashions, I ordered the entire 2nd season of Downton Abbey, to see what I had missed: I was not disappointed! The intertwining  lives of aristocrats and their servants was riveting and the actors,completely believable...In fact, it was interesting that they could portray their dramas  without extravagant gestures and histrionics:...simple eye expressions were eloquent...body language revealing....voices,well modulated... The polite, reserved, but emotionally deep national English character that we all know and love, is  well displayed...  Most interesting to me, were the authentically designed and constructed costumes of the early 20th century,This validated a part In my book where I write, &#34;When I watch a film made in England, I am in awe of the meticulous recreation of authentic costumes --The cut, fit workmanship and knowledgeable use of vintage fabrics is a joy to see. This accuacy is possible because they have access to original garments from which to work--.Because of ancestral pride and sense of history original clothes were saved for posteriity&#34;..The costumes in Downton Abbey are remarkable examples of this authenticity.

B00F880BWG|5|Best show ever
B00FATEJYE|5|Excellent game! Definitely one of the best apps I have downloaded! I have almost mastered the game since last Christmas. I hope marvel comes up with something just as good for my device!
B00065F87E|5|Blocks out stray light and is beneficial to glasses wearers
B000AYEIZY|5|I was lucky enough to see the Cream live in Providence (I'm guessing '68) and would still rate it my best concert ever (including the Beatles, Stones and Hendrix).  I was simply blown away by their power and virtuosity.  The surprising standout was Jack Bruce, whose bass playing stood up to the best rock drummer and guitarist in the world.  Anyway, the new album did not disappoint.  In fact, I'm surprised all three are still alive...
B00EGMQIJ0|3|The ending seems a bit rushed and for me, that let the book down. But the subject matter gives opportunity for thoughtful musing on how our interconnected digital world erodes our privacy and the opportunity to be different without being seen as deviant.
B002BI6SMI|5|Girlfriend choose this, and it was a good watch. So I rate it five stars (it was good). ABC 123
B007XAYKX8|5|Fastest is one of the best racing documentaries period. The action shots are up close and technical. The interviews are short, concise and compelling. Do not miss it. It should be on your short list of racing documentaries.
B00005QFHG|5|I just finished watching this film for the 3rd time. Wonderful to have the time to watch it by myself this third time. To put all my emotions into it. Juliette Binoche has the appearance of a perfect flower. The acting, the lives of small town studiously religious inhabitants being interrupted by a chocolate shop. A movie to savour with all your senses.
B006O5XYWG|5|very well done. great character and story development, and the effects were good too.
B00499K9E0|5|I loved every minute of this show, from the characters, plots, themes, costuming, even the cinematography.  Far and away one of the best things ever made, this show brilliantly adapts the a time-honored character to a new age.
B00004RFFS|5|I first was introduced to this movie when I was 13, and it still haunts me today.  I read the book two years later, and suprisingly, I love both just as much!  I was also glad that Anne Rice that did the screenplay, since not a lot of authors get that chance.  By her doing that, she brought what she wrote to life instead of someone else.    Tom Cruise: Best performance I've ever seen, since he's very diverse in his career. I haven't looked at him the same way since, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  Very chilling, likeable and sexy!    Brad Pitt: Another great performance of Louis! I love the humanity still portrayed after he's turned, and adds a bit of light to the film.    Kirsten Dunst: Scared the life out of me!  Just as scary, and sick, as in the novel.  She touches the surface of her love for Louis, which made her such a great performer.    Antonio Banderas: In the book, Armand is much younger, but hey when you get someone sexy like Banderas, you can't complain!  Just the way he looks at the characters makes you wish you weren't really there.    Another thing I absolutely loved was the dark, beautiful soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal.  That is one any vampire lover must have in their music library.  The opening song sucks you right in until the very end.  But one thing I didn't like, since I'm religious, was the nudity and torture to the girl on the stage.  It was in the novel, and I'm glad they stayed faithful to it, but it was hard to watch.  But otherwise, the blood and dark atmosphere was amazing to watch.  This is highly recommended, you won't regret it!
B007KQ6XYY|5|We love puzzles and Cut the Rope fits the bill. Easy and difficult. Wish there were more games like this.
B0042U94UQ|5|I love this movie so much.  After I watched it with my little cousin, I was certain to order it.  This movies is extremely heartfelt and teaches the true meaning of love and family.  It was one of the first movies that I've ever teared up in.  My family and I watched it, and we all loved it.  It's entertaining for all ages, and the little minions are sure to make anyone laugh.
B00000JZC4|5|This cd is amazing. It has loud and angry songs and then soft and beautiful songs. Both types equally great. Although I've been listening to this cd everyday for the past couple weeks it is still not getting old. In  fact, it seems to get better with every listen. Right up there with NIN's  the Fragile (although completely different) as the best rock album of the  year.
B00DL48BM6|5|I love the movie.  Its make you stop and think what the Jews have gone thru.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|I thought that this game was amazing. If you like cod and minecraft this game is for you. Have fun!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5|Great depiction of integrity vs. selfish vindictiveness, romance, honor, and loyalty.  I LOVE it!
B005XQLBU4|3|Pretty fun little game. Nice graphics. Gets kinda hard in the higher levels. Worth spending a buck or 2 on.
B005LAIIHG|5|Great condition and fast shipping. The movie was great my family was very addicted to watching once a day and on weekends, but I am happy to say that we watch it less now, maybe once a weekend they still love it.
B005EPKS8A|5|great
B00AEFY6ZQ|5|I was never a big John Wayne fan but my father had seen them all.  I saw this on MoviesTV Network and feel in love with it.  I've now watched it so many times I can quote pieces of it back to you.  Well made film.
B00AA0TJO8|5|You get to draw a stick man and let it come to life! I always wanted to play something like this! All of the levels are challenging. This is what makes it fun! There is always a puzzle. I like how you play it. I love the different pencils. This is a great game! You need to buy it!!!!!
B006O6F932|5|My little one loves all things Monster High, so this was a must. Has really cute details.  And folds up for storage or travel.
B000AYEL6U|5|My favorite love story, along with Jane Austen's Persuasion!!!!!!
B000088E6D|5|I have to say that I was very impressed and surprised at the caliber of this young man's voice.  For a lad so young he has the sound of someone who has been singing for a decade.  He brings to life each and every song with his own special touch.  I feel that he is at the beginning of a wonderful and long career.  I will be looking forward to anything that this artist puts out.  I only hope that he stays with this wonderful style of music and brings us another c.d. as wonderful of this one
B00IMYSCR4|5|I love Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and the two of them together was amazing.  There were some parts that were a little slow - but very realistic.
B00HDMMISA|4|Was entertaining enough.  Quick read.  Good for a flight.
B000003CMB|5|This is one legendary CD. Just 7 songs on the original double album and the length of the songs alone was revolutionary. What they did with the extended time to play was remarkable. This is the original lineup in absolute top form. Gregg's singing and organ playing, Berry's bass, the 2 drummers interplay and Dickey's guitar work all shine but the real star of this is Duane. You'll never hear better guitar playing from anyone. Dunae has solos all over the album and what he does with them can not be duplicated 35 years later. A collection of rock music, great guitar work, or live in concert performances would be never be complete without this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5|It's free. It's angry. It's birds. How can you go wrong?
B008XKSW7M|5|I really enjoyed this movie - it was funny, cute and all the actors did a great job acting out what it would be like to be expecting.
B00A6CCF0K|3|Started strong with elements that dug into the Torrance family history, the undead ghosts of the past. But the plot supporting the portrait of Dan Torrance doesn't quite work. After awhile, you simply want the True Knot thing to be over with...
B00000JCOV|1|How do &quot;bands&quot; like Slipknot get signed anyway?  No Talent what so ever!  However, I won't say that Slipknot are Korn Klones. With Korn, you can actually hear some emotion in the music, lyrics, and singing. With  the exception of Metallica (old and new), RATM, NIN, Ozzy/Sabbath, &amp;  Type O-, I barely listen to metal. Slipknot make me thankful for that!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Just dwnld also dwnld the audible feature, I tried it and will enjoy listen to the book being read to me while I'm driving, very affordable feature, looking forward to future purchases.
B007J4T2G8|5|Absolutely amazing. This is my second time reading the series and I love it. Not just the sexual parts but the book itself is very well written. It's sad, witty, sweet, it's everything I love in a book. I'm anxious for the movie to come out!
B00CNBS40M|5|My 8 year-old son wanted this for Christmas and was extremely excited to receive.  He put it together over Christmas and was very happy.  He really liked the fact that the wings move up and down and they do it in parallel with each other.  We have tons of Legos and I like this one because it seems to stay together better than most.
B000SEIK2S|5|John Scalzi tells a story here that is kept interesting through out the whole book. His caricatures are very well written. One of the few books I've read several times and will read again.
B006VRDZ44|5|Excellent series, every episode keeps you wanting more just finished watching season one can't wait to start season two
B00729GQ0A|5|this is a great book. there are alot of vampire type books out there and it is good to find one that is different from the rest. great job Rebecca :)
B000Y7U98C|1|Having seen the trailers and knowing something about Danny Boyle, I bought \\"Sunshine.\\" Mistake. The film was arguably THE worst sci fi film I've ever seen. Confused storyline, incomprehensible plot, stock characters (and one who appears from nowhere with no explanation of how he got onboard the Icarus), \\"standard\\" special effects, woefully inadequate (incompetent?) editing. A total waste of time, except for Cillian Murphy's performance, but even that couldn't save this cinematic disaster.     There is no chemistry between actors/characters, and the idea that the film delves into \\"philosophical dilemmas\\" is laughable.     Save your money. Save your brain. This flick is on a par with \\"Battlefield Earth.\\"
B00K2CHVSK|4|good movie nice take on the franchise
B003Y3MYYU|5|This new Decca boxed edition of Böhm's Ring means you can now buy all four operas in Wagner's epic for the price that used to be charged for Die Walküre alone. When you take into account sonics, casting, conducting and orchestral  playing there is no better Ring. The Bayreuth acoustic is captured magnificently and there are no weak links in the cast. This makes a perfect first Ring, certainly far preferable to the [[ASIN:B0000042H4 Solti Ring]] which is the standard recommendation. No libretto is included so pick up Andrew Porter's classic translation of [[ASIN:0393008673 The Ring of the Nibelung]], with side by side German and English text,  and you're all set. For more reviews of this set see these reviews of earlier editions: [[ASIN:B000025ESY Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen [Box Set]]] and [[ASIN:B0000040YY Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen, WWV 86a-d (1966- 1967)]]. There are about forty additional reviews in all. The packaging is different but the content and remastering are the same.
B000JMKQX0|5|\\"World War Z\\" succeeds on every level. It is a zombie story with enough zombie goodness to please the most die hard fan of the genre. It also gets zombies right. They are frightening without being super-powered. Zombies have shock value when they first arrive on the scene, but not in the way that the old \\"cat jumping out of the closet\\" gag has shock value. The true horror of zombies is in their pervasiveness. It doesn't matter if you are in the bleeding edge most industrialized city on earth or the most rural of tribal areas, people die and their bodies are buried somewhere. Zombies can not be manipulated, they can not be reasoned with, and they can not be intimidated. This is the horror of zombies and Max Brooks absolutely nails it.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" moves beyond the zombies though. They are ever present, and yet they are not the one and only star of the show. The rise of zombies is a backdrop against which the story of human frailty is told. It is a story of the times in which we rise above, and the ways in which we utterly fail. Some of us face the horror with valor and conviction, others of us find a way to gain some advantage from it. Our actions can be commendable or thoroughly abhorrent, and yet they are always very real and very human.<br /><br />The story is presented as a series of vignettes. Each is a snapshot of what was going on during the war against the dead. At times characters will appear in each other's snapshots, giving us the opportunity to see someone's actions not only through their own eyes, but also through the eyes of those around them, and the rumors that spread about them. At first glance you may be tempted to judge certain people and their responses to the threat as \\"evil\\", but then you get to look at what they did through another lens and better understand why they did things the way that they did. You come to realize just how complex their decisions really are. \\"Good\\" and \\"Evil\\" become far less clear cut than we might like to believe.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" is an immensely entertaining zombie novel, but what makes it so much more is the brilliant social commentary that runs through the story. You do not have to be a fan of zombie fiction to be blown away by this very human story.ieve.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" is an immensely entertaining zombie novel, but what makes it so much more is the brilliant social commentary that runs through the story.

B00HAQAQME|5|Cate Blanchett is a marvel in this movie - can't say enough about how well she plays a troubled character whose pretentious life only took her so far.  I knew nothing about this movie before I saw it and, while it is depressing, it is well done and does have its comical moments. It's worth seeing just to see Cate Blanchett. Incredible.
B007FEFLTO|5|Loved it as much as the first one and can't wait to start the third. Putting it off because I don't want it to be over!
B00L9B7IKE|4|Great book - read it in 2 days
B00NN5JUOG|5|I've had this for about 2 months now and carried if everyday with some rough use. It's still working great and is very useful. The quality is really good and worth the money over the cheap alternatives.

B006ID6NDQ|5|Good and very sad as all such storys are.
B00JJHDX9A|4|Terrific set design and special effects. If you are a fan of  Jacksons Lord of the Rings Trilogy you'll love it but this film focuses on action scenes and lacks character development and level of acting found in LOTR.
0425263916|4|The story picks up immediately after the first book ended. The same formula works here with the back and forth and Eva attempting to self-therapize the relationship. We get as confused as Eva when Gideon seems to break up with her. Has he really taken up with his ex-fiance at the expense of the only woman he claims to have loved?
B000002C1W|5|If you are a Pink Floyd fan, this one is no disappointment.  Like Dark Side, this one delivers with great tunes, great lyrics, and smooth transitions from one cut to the next; something Pink Floyd has usually done very well.  It is my second favorite album from this band, not far behind Dark Side of the Moon.
B00003CXA2|5|This movie is a delight his perseverance not to quit. His love of one girl. His love for his son.
B004XJHBCE|5|I have an LG Optimus V and having this app really made things easier with tab space on my android. Using the folder widget makes getting my contacts and apps much more organized and easier to access. Highly, highly recommended since it's free for today.

B00280LYHS|4|My gratitude to the author of the book for writing us this marvellous book on Greek mythology but I can urge him to continue
B006G83G2O|5|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years, from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding, that puts the violence, fear, hope and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives, the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness, are inextricable from the history playing out around them.<br />Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heartwrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love, a stunning accomplishment.
6304711905|4|I love this movie.  I haven't watched this particular DVD yet.  I have always loved this one best of the Wyatt Earp movies.  Val Kilmer makes quite the great Doc.  He did a superb job.  I will post an update after I watch this movie to make sure it didn't get scratched.  It seems to me it was a Big Error in the Packaging at the Factory where they made the DVD.  It did not have anything to do with Amazon or their packaging.  I would recommend this movie.  Just a bit upset at the factory people for not doing a better job of the making and packaging of thier product before leaving the factory.
006202406X|5|I'm sad to see so many bad reviews of this book. I finished the series yesterday, and I think it may be one of the best I have ever read. Something about these characters just speaks to me. I love how they are strong yet riddled with inner demons, regrets and fears. I love that the author shared some of their innermost thought processes with us. Did the ending make me happy? Not hardly. But I also believe that it is one that opens up a great discussion and leaves the reader thinking. In a day and age where I personally feel like young people (an older ones as well) don't always know how to handle hardship, this book takes the reader on a journey. There are &#34;easy fixes,&#34; and there are other ways of going about things. I appreciate that this book doesn't always choose easy. I feel like I have so much to say about it, but I can't seem to formulate everything properly. I just highly recommend it! Read it. Read it with an open mind, and notice the &#34;moments that don't suck&#34; when they come around.
B007SYWFRM|5|Love It!! this game is really fun. it may have things you can purchase with real money but you don't have to to play the game. works great and has nice graphics. great free game!! lots of praise!! played on kindle fire.
0061900656|5|I bought this book for my 2 year old 2 months before I was due to have my second child. He took to it right away and we read it daily. He loved to point out the little boy and say it was himself. The book tells a story that it simple yet engaging. I highly recommend.
B001O1O71C|3|This one wasn't my favorite read but it was worth reading. The friendship between the two boys is remarkable although some other details are kind of unbelievable.
B0014JKJHK|5|No comment got just what I ordered
B00BAXFAJC|5|The Luminaries is worth wading through the slow start of an unpredictable story that captures a piece of New Zealand history by complex and varied individuals.
B0054SMIH6|4|Its a good movie although the book is better.  While the movie closely follows the book, the movie doesn't build the suspense as much as the book does.
B0000AXE8I|4|the first matrix grabbed the viewers attention because of its first introduction to its great special effects that dazzled the eyes of those who saw it and its intriging explanation of what the matrix was. So the second one didnt have much too talk about except the background info that nobody cared about because the first one gave us all the interesting stuff. The action scenes were good but they lasted too long to keep the watchers interested. The movie became more of an anoyance that kepted dragging on about alot of talk that made viewers exhausted and bored because of the things said that nobody really cared about. But the special effects were great and the movie overall, wasnt that bad.
0694003611|4|A little damage to the binding but my son loves it. Would order again. I thought it was the bigger version but it's a little tiny travel sized book
B004SBQAN8|2|The book was decent, though the plot could be described as \\"my girlfriend is more important than the universe itself\\".<br />The movie was so terrible! They should have called it \\"I am Number Six\\" because that was what the movie was about. The characters were all blonde (except Sam. Yay Sam!) Henri was a creep. The dog was a creep. Number Six was a creep.<br />I actually liked John and his girlfriend though. They got together wayyyy too fast, but it was still okay.<br />I find it funny, during the party scene where John goes to get his girlfriend, the sherriff walks through the party (where all the kids are drinking, as mentioned later by the Mogdorian who says \\"a drunk young man like you\\") and doesn't even say anything about the kids being underage, or having a party in his house, which, by the way, in the book, was a secret party because the bully's parents were out of town. (The house got burned down in the book. Yeah. That was kind of a big part.)<br />That's just it. The kids did not look like highschoolers.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />Henri died way too early. He dies during the battle at the school. And actually, most of the fighting with the beasts took place outside the school. In the forest and whatever.<br />END SPOILER<br /><br />The only redeeming thing in this movie was Sam, for one thing, and the floor polisher. That's like the one thing that didn't change from the book. What the HECK was up with those \\"Mogs\\", which, by the way, they were never referred to as in the book.<br />Their powers were all wrong. ALL wrong. Is Six Nightcrawler now? Her power is invisibility. It's John that is resistant to heat. What was up with his Lumen?<br /><br />The book wasn't great. The movie was awful. The author is going to get a big head and this is going to turn out Hunger Games/Transformers (\\"I know it's not my fight\\" - Sam &lt;- LOL!)/ Maximum Ride.
B004SDSSFY|5|I installed this the free version of this application on my Kindle Fire when I got the device immediately because I handles some complex Excel documents that I have. QuickOffice, the other office application that is available from the Amazon App Store and comes preloaded on the Kindle Fire, is very (and I mean very) slow with these large, complex documents. The full version of Documents To Go has a lot of features and works with all files that I have sent to it. For large documents, it can take a while to load, but the documents functions completely as expected on a mobile device, although some of the more complex formatting in Word documents can be simplified for mobile display. I don't think I would recommend Documents To Go for creating new documents, but for reading and making small modifications to existing documents, this application works 100% as advertised.

B000QCS8TW|5|Although I have been watching the series on HBO, there is still nothing like reading the book to get the true nuances of the characters personalities and traits.

B0092MKFIY|3|not a bad album to listen to overall, but it sounds like a compilation of several other artists, ones that I've heard before. I actually listen to it and go, \\"oh, this is the motion city soundtrack song, this is the killers song,\\" etc. but I think it was worth the 5 bucks. I especially like the song demons.
B007ZXK08C|4|Kept Me Interesred, Ending Was A Bit Different.
B000002H70|5|Disintegration is the CD I reached for in college when I couldn't fall asleep (that's a compliment!).  Within 1 minute of hearing the opening track, I would feel myself floating away, riding the wave of Robert Smith's vocals and the ambient synth &amp; guitars.  Hearing this CD for the first time is like reading a poem that strikes you in the heart and stays with you for a very long time. Feeling miserable has never felt this good! You can completely immerse yourself in this CD.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Disintegration,&quot; &quot;Plainsong.,&quot; and &quot;Fascination Street.&quot;  The raw emotion and intensity of the song &quot;Disintegration&quot; is simultaneously heartbreaking and lovely.  If you don't already own this CD, you are missing out.
B00006JL1Z|1|I must have received a different version than everyone else. My first CD contains no songs except those that are buried within Fleetwood.exe and Dreams.mov. This should have been a bonus CD and CD 1 should have been left the way it probably was originally. I don't want songs buried in QuickTime movies. For some strange reason, they don't want to play in my CD player. Pathetic.
B00FRVH3V6|5|Awesome! Rick is honestly one of the best authors I've ever read. I love percy Jackson, I hope he makes another series with him
B00846F1YW|1|I could never get past the intro screen and it wouldn't let me click on any buttons.  The screen looked like it everything was in the wrong place, so never actually got to play it.
B00O1YSGR0|5|This game is So much fun for my 5 year olds ! They both love it ! They love that you get to  pick your player and then you chase a different player through the maze. The mazes will change as the levels go, but nothing too hard for them to figure out on their own, or after being shown once how to do it. Fun for the whole family.
B005LAII4E|5|I love this movie!!!! All the action sequences, the story line. the ninja's and Road Block. The addition of the Rock as this character was really a good choice. Too bad they killed off Duke. They could have kept him for the sequel. This movie was fun. Watch without prejudice. =). I hope for a Scarlet comeback in the sequel as well as Siena Miller.
B00MG4CUH4|5|I will keep this review short and to the point as best I can. I'm sure others will provide great detail on specifics. My review is for those who want to know if it's  worth the money to shell out  for this set, when you most likely  own the collection in various formats, ( cd's, lps etc.). Absolutely, a resounding  Yes !!. I was having buyers remorse since I already have the last remasters of ATMP and LITMW. The sonic differences are great, especially in the presentation of his voice. This really made the difference  for me. The clarity and the warmth in the instrumentation hits you in that soft spot. These guys who remastered this are on their A game. It should make you feel very happy to listen  to these new upgrades . You can clearly hear the separation and perfection that we should of heard All those years Ago. I've been going through the set all day. Just superb. I wonder if some people who can't hear a difference are playing them on a semi descent set. I knew some people who couldn't hear the difference in the Beatles remasters. The look of the box set is a work of art as well if that means anything to anyone. A must have for George fans, As far as the music, well ,we all know it's a 10 out of 10. Enjoy everyone , you will not regret a penny !!
B0006L16N8|3|I haven't bought the cd, but I've heard most of the songs from it. Over the past couple months coldplay and their new cd has been so hyped up, someone called them \\"the most important band of the 21st century\\". What?! I like coldplay, but their music has never seemed all that memorable. And I try to like their new music(and I do like some of it-fix you, speed of sound), but all I hear is U2 being copied(whether they meant to or not). And all I keep hearing is how their going to give U2 competition for best rock band. Excuse me? For one their not exactly rock(even though they`ve tried to do that a little this album), and Coldplay is no where near U2. When Bono sings you can really feel it through his lyrics and singing, where with coldplay its just kind of there. STOP COMPARING THE TWO! It seems either two thing are going to come of all their hype. A)it will hurt them, all this build up then many disappointed or B)no one will say anything, and they'll keep on being overhyped. The guys in coldplay all seem like nice guys. But it seems like people are blind, no one seems to wants to give any criticism. Their a good band, but I don't think they deserve this supergroup status they've been given. Go listen to U2 if you want that. Anyways...over all the cd was good, but not all that original or worthy of its build up.
B00AEBBA0Y|4|Liked it a lot better this time. However, it is still a far cry from the book.
B002G01EPC|5|I was fortunate enough to find this figure for a reasonable price recently. I am glad I did because I did not want to pay the secondary market price. So I'm lucky.<br /><br />I really like the SH Figuarts line. These are literally the best DB figures you can find. They come with interchangeable hands, faces, arms,and unique accessories.<br /><br />I hope they make a few more characters. The price is a bit crazy on these things even for normal retail. But they are Japanese imports, come with tons of extras, well packaged, and well crafted. You get what you pay for, and these things are awesome.
B0044C5SCU|5|Excellent and exciting show. One of the better sci-fi shows out there. I have watched it several times.

B000002H2H|5|Its funny because i used to think thrash bands were slayer,sodom,kreator,angeldeath,testament,and such...Now metallica's ride the lightning was thrash and the idiot below me is correct about that, but when he called slayer? Deathmetal?You've got to be kidding me! I quess thats when he made his first mistake.Another thing, its not \\"reing in blood\\" its \\"reign in blood\\" misspelling one masterpiece THRASH metal album is a blasphemy and only rap/nu-metal fans do that because they've no clue about it.I  quote my idiot friend thats blows me, i mean below me \\"i burnt myself out on this album and metallicas albums in genaral\\" wow, your smart! Do me a favor? Go listing to some korn,linkin park,tool,staind,slipknot in other words? Something that suits you and leave real metal alone. Kids stick to nu-metal, because you all look stupid thinking you know about metal when you  dont know anything about it. Metallica's \\"ride the lightning\\" is a masterpiece! Recommended for real metalheads not posers...Like the loser below me.  <br /> <br />PS:When slayer first started? Deathmetal wasn't even born yet, so stop talking out of your ass. If you knew about metal? You would know that slayer was one of the first early 80's bands!Retard.
B004DLPXAO|5|Great app. Must get for your device
B005HWUBZ0|4|Some great motor city style music.  Hawthorne has the voice to carry this off, comparable to Robin Thick and that's meant to be a compliment.  All the music is original be sure to listen to &#34;The Walk&#34; and &#34;A Long Time&#34;, though pretty much everything is good on this album.
B00BUCXVPI|3|Lacking a central figure who resembles the physical size and character of Jack Reacher in the Reacher books, this was just another action movie.
B0013K1ALE|5|This is an awesome DVD set with footage of the band at home and then heading to the concert. It gives a glimpse into their real characters and hearts. The concert footage is awesomely good and i had to get my own copy because the footage is the group at the height of their excellence, power, and soul and there is no better way to appreciate all of that than to watch this footage and the concerts and have pure enjoyment of them! All the extra oare very cool, too!
0553269631|5|I only read this book because it was on a \\"Top 100\\" list a while back.  Much to my surprise, it was one of the best books I have ever read.  The characters were very identifiable and refreshing.   The writing style was easy to read and non-pretentious.  It was a great book on human understanding and emotion.  I thoroughly recommend this book!
0062273205|5|I typically can't stand business books and abandon most within the first 20 pages or so.<br /><br />This book was different. Ben drew me in past the point of no return with captivating stories about his rise and struggles in entrepreneurship. He then referenced back to these times to drive home points later on in the book. It was very well done and approaches subjects most other books don't.<br /><br />For anyone trying to start a business or current deep into one, this book WILL have something you have been avoiding, but should address
B0026772N8|1|This is an awful, awful book, one that fails on every level.  Poor writing conveying bad thinking.  Save your money and your time and avoid this like the plague, because it is horrible.<br /><br />You know a book is terrible when it ends up on the &#34;I Don't Even Own a Television&#34; podcast, and they had a pretty gleeful time ripping this book to shreds.  So at least it did *some* good.  Otherwise, this book never should have been written, published, or read by anybody.
B003PGNBO8|4|FlashForward was a sci-fi fantasy series broadcast on ABC during the 2009/2010 season, while Lost was in its final season 6. Designed as an upmarket, cinematic TV series, ABC probably hoped it would replace the magical island and its inhabitants, but declining ratings during this one and only season lead to cancellation, meaning Flashforward and Lost went into television history simultaneously. The 'complete' series is the full 22 episodes presented here (an earlier box, released mid-season, covered only the first ten. Avoid it).<br /><br />The series started out in very promising fashion. Wasting no time with introductory formalities, we are thrown into Los Angeles at a time when the people seem to drop to the ground and zone out in 'blackouts' which occurred around the globe. (Those operating aircraft and vehicles - and their passengers - were less lucky and added overtones of death to the proceedings). After 137 seconds, survivors snapped out of it and dealt with the ensuing chaos. It also became clear that they experienced flashforwards - seeing themselves in odd situations some six months later. Season one, it seems, was intended to follow a core group of characters as they navigate their way to April 2010, and the fates that await them. This meant unraveling the strands of their flashforward visions and filling in the details. The main character (played by Joseph Fiennes)  is Mark Benford, an FBI agent whose flashforward showed him dealing with a bulletin board of clues (the mosaic), lapsing back into alcoholism, and awaiting a certain fate at the hands of masked gunmen seeking him out as he ponders this mosaic in the office. In the meantime, his physician wife sees herself at home in the intimate company of another man. During the course of the season, these dramas, and those of their colleagues, get played out. This means we're focused on FBI agents, and hospital staff, for most of the season. More sinister elements and characters are introduced as the causeof the blackouts is investigated.<br /><br />One such FBI agent (sympathetically played by John Cho) has no flashforward, an ominous situation which suggests he will no longer be alive the following April. This presents one of the more interesting predicaments of the season, as one finds a whole host of citizens who did not experience a flashforward, a development which opens up a whole host of questions about fate and changing the future. In the meantime, Dominic Monaghan (in a major Lost reference) appears as Simon Campos, an eccentric who may have something to do with this major event.<br /><br />It's difficult to pinpoint just why this show didn't catch on with viewers as expected (the pilot drew 12.5 million, which dwindled to less than 7 million by season's end). The token Halloween episode is a high point, taking the trick or treat concept deeply into the ongoing 'mosaic' developments, showing what the drama was capable of when it was 'on'. The show went on mid-season hiatus, during which time the showrunners must have had a few meetings to determine just how to move things along. In my opinion the show jumped the shark as this second part began. The plot upped the ante with some confusing and temporary developments involving eccentric genius Simon Campos, some disposable characters who kidnap some of the good guys, and recurring references to quantum entanglement and its relation to consciousness. A few of the plot lines appear promising but provide little payoff (such as a major thread involving Afghanistan). A bright spot is chess playing eccentric who sends a core portion of the cast on a trek to Somalia, where a prototype blackout had been staged in the early 80s. Much of it is entertaining, but there are too many faces and tenuous connections to make a lasting impression.<br /><br />Comparisons to Lost don't always help. The sprawling LA basin doesn't afford the visual variety of Hawaii, and the cast of characters here, while decently played, are lesscolorful and eccentric than those found on the magic island. You'll enjoy picking up the Lost references (Monaghan, and Sonya Walger, who played Penny in the older series, are familiar faces). Benford's daughter is named 'Charlie', and the mosaic features a drawing of a swan. We learn about the 80s blackouts from leftover grainy videotape, with our chess player laying out the happenings in very Dharma-like fashion.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoy this sort of programming, and can handle an unresolved cliffhanger ending, I'd recommend a purchase, given the very low price now asked. There are a few extras, such as behind the scenes, interviews, and a couple of commentaries. While not exactly the crown jewels, they are interesting enough. Overall rating for the series: 3.5 stars (4.0 for the first half, 3.0 for the second).  Had the show continued, some of the roughness would have been smoothed out, but it was cancelled, and I can't change the future.
B005ZOBNOI|5|When one of my friends recommended I read \\"The Fault in Our Stars,\\" I looked it up and wondered why he was recommending it to a college age male. But it was a friend who I trusted so I decided to give it a try.  I took out a hold on the book from my library's ebook collection, (I was number 8000 on the list) and after 3 months I finally got my chance to check the book out.  I was blown away. The story is well written and absorbing, even for someone who is not necessarily in the target audience.  Along with the the story, The author also manages to dose us with a number of life lessons which can be appreciated by everyone young or old, healthy or, god forbid, unwell. The story left me with many ideas to ponder and I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone (though some elements, like the constant underlying discussion of death, as well as some of the aspects of the romance, could make it unsuitable for children and some younger teens). There were also some elements of the ending that I intuited as the story went on (I'm trying to avoid spoilers), but this, as is often the case, may have been intended by the author.
0385388896|5|The author did a great job with the characters and storyline on this book.  Put simply, it made me want to read the following books in this series.  I must say the language created by the characters that took the place of words you may fill in yourself was amusing and happy it carried over into the books.  I would recommend this book for those who like a good sci-fi novel
0671876813|2|Of the five Honor Harrington books I've read so far, this is the only one that had me skipping pages. Weber moves away from what made the series so enjoyable -- the military angle -- and the result is a book that's 80 percent politics, with only a smattering of the fleet-dueling, ship-maneuvering fun.<br /><br />Worse, there are seemingly endless passages of characters' introspection. Yes, it rounds them out to see their thought processes, but after 10 or 12 paragraphs that serve as either overdone exposition or needless history lesson, it's a bit tiresome.<br /><br />Imagine something like this:<br /><br />\\"Smith looked out the window at the fields below -- fields his father had inherited after the first civil war, which saw more than 80 percent of the farms in the region destroyed. His father, himself the child of a military man, had pledged never to let that happen again. And because his father was a Jonesian by birth, that promise also carried on to the younger Smith. Jonesians were known galaxy-wide for their unwavering resolve, a fact that had served Smith well. It helped, of course, that he had been trained at the Johnson Academy, known for instilling the virtues of both economic sense and military prowess in its students. But because those students often....\\"<br /><br />You get the idea. Now imagine it going on and on for several pages. So much for \\"show them, don't tell them.\\"<br /><br />There are other issues with \\"Flag in Exile.\\" Ironically, while such overzealous inner dialog gives supporting characters more depth, Honor Harrington is in danger of becoming a caricature. She's too perfect. Her officers are all incredible. Her staff is top of the line. Her crew is wonderful. Her plans always work. In earlier books we learned she's a perfect shot -- possibly one of the best there is. Her treecat, Nimitz, is the only one known to develop a two-way empathic link. In this book, [SPOILER WARNING!!!] despite less than a year's training, she's able to defeat one of the best sword fighters on the planet in a fraction of second while bruised, broken, and exhausted. [END SPOILER]<br /><br />To say believability is stretched is an understatement.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first four books in the series, and will be starting the sixth soon. But if I find myself confronted with overly long exposition and a lead character who can do no wrong, that's it for Honor Harrington.in a fraction of second while bruised, broken, and exhausted.

B00007BHOE|4|This was the best DVD I have ever seen in my life.  The performence was great, the crowd was great, everything was great. Although, the reason I am giving this DVD 4 stars and not 5 is because the amps for james and micks guitars were to quiet. But other than that it was great. My words of wisdome are...just buy the DVD, I have no other comments.
B0000TB01Y|5|Wicked was the musical that I had never heard of.  Men doing repair work on our house wanted to thank us for being so cooperative when they had to stay four extra months constructing.  So they bought us tickets to see some new musical called Wicked.  Well, I had never heard of it, but BOY was I glad I did! I have now seen it three times, have the soundtrack on my i-Tunes and i-Pod, and play the soundtrack in my CD changer whenever I have the change.  I fell quickly in love with Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenowith's voices, and as much as Popular made me laugh, I'm Not That Girl made my cry, and Defying Gravity made me gape as I saw it on stage.  It is an amazing musical, and the album is nothing less.

B000002VCQ|3|Whitney Houston's debut album was great because of Whitney's killer chops but the songs on here are pretty average. Clive Davis thinks he is the best thing that ever existed but he likes to control his artists every move, from picking the songs and what their image should be. Whitney should've been given better material than these run-of-the-mill pop tunes. How Will I Know is still my favorite Whitney song but overall, Whitney was told what to do and that's never a good thing.
B005L38QK2|5|Bought it for my husband for Christmas. He has a gaming laptop and plays MMO's and FPS. He said he can really tell the difference between the Diablo Gaming Mouse and the regular mouse he had been using. Says gameplay is a lot better.
B00IKZX1ZI|3|This game is fun but like many you get to a certain level and it is nearly impossible to move on until you buy something.  this aggravates me with these &#34;free&#34; games.  I'd rather pay upfront then be tapped for more in the middle of a game.
B001GJOL22|5|I was fortunate to see Rush twice on this tour so I was familiar with the show at the start. Fantastic! The camera angles are outstanding,detail is  great in hi-def,but the sound just blew me away. If you can't enjoy the lossless audio format do yourself a favor and upgrade your system. You won't be dissapointed. Movies are so real and if bands continue to do blu-ray discs of their tours,well,man oh man we're in for the best audio era since stereophonic recording became the norm!
0800141660|5|When Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman) walked into the room I think my heart stopped. This movie was an excellent adaptation of the original story. Of course being an Alan Rickman fan made it all the better for me. Excellent movie, great actors, this is one you want in your visual library folks. Trust me just buy it!!!!
B00B7Y0206|5|I initially side loaded Youtube, but I wasn't able to log in. With vTube, I can log in just fine. Performs as Youtube should.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is amazing!!
B0088TG252|5|A great story. Makes me even more cynical than I already am. Believable in that the authors were not afraid to allow main characters to reach not so good endings. A page turner from the get go. I enjoyed it very much.
B00004U8JU|4|This movie was expected to be filmed right after the end titles of Jurassic Park. The subject was so good that there was no way that Spielberg would let the oportunity to go away.  Even the book, by Michael Crichton,  was written after the first movie in order to have the storyline for this  follow up. The story is a little weak but the special effects are almost as  good as in Jurassic Park (due to, I think, the much less time they had to  prepare this, compared to the first). For those who have seen J.P. and have  big expectations for these movie, hold on a little bit and yo'll enjoy it  very much.  For those who just want to see a good action/family movie, its  an excellent choice.

B009XIXVU6|5|This novel is absolutely engrossing. It paints vividly the spiritual nature of family relationships that affect our lives from our  birth to our death. It illustrates how we all crave and need love, connection, acceptance and approval to feel secure and complete. This is a wonderful  book.
B00BSBR9N6|4|This was a quick and easy read, kind of like watching a whole season of The Big Bang Theory. I would recommend it.
0345428064|5|After reading Bravo Two Zero and Immediate Action I decided to take a read of Remote Control, being the first fiction book Andy McNab has written I was unsure what to expect.  After reading the first few pages I was hooked, it got my interest right away.  Andy McNab maintains his successful down to earth writing style, he is descriptive but to the point, its rare you find yourself bored by a flood of inconsequential technical details.<br />The character, Nick Stone, is like McNab an ex SAS soldier.  He now lives his life doing deniable operations for the British intelligence agency.  The rest you just got to read to find out.<br />It's this book that opens the door to what I hope will be a very interesting and somewhat educating series of books.  McNab's down to earth sense of things shows in the way he writes the book, Nick Stone is no super hero, he can't take out a whole regiment of soldiers with a few grenades and an Uzi.  This is the kind of book I have been waiting for, a book written by a guy who knows what he is talking about, he knows his characters limits and he doesn't breach these, I only hope this is maintained through the series.<br />I particulary like the obvious advertising placed in the book, it must be nice to be offered such a large sum of money to mention a product in your book, nice one Mr McNab!<br />I give this book 5 Stars.
B0097GVJWQ|5|this is a fun and addictive game. I get to solve a mystery and do puzzles at the same time.
B005J2V74C|2|100% predictable; 94% crappily acted. Had a few decent scares.
B00DURILJ2|5|Wow ... I was not expecting to like this film, and it blew me away. I particularly loved the atmosphere that exudes from the film -- the murky Mississippi somehow creeps from the screen and into the senses.<br /><br />So, what’s the film about? It’s about blindly discovering whom you can trust and whom you can’t trust. Who’s telling the truth and who’s lying? Who are the bad guys and who are really the good guys? And most importantly -- what is real love and what’s not? As the film plays out, we discover that the answers aren’t always clear, or, what they first appear to be.<br /><br />Finally, who is Mud’s true love? It's the one who left it all to run away with him, of course. But, you will have to watch the entire film to see who that is. I’ll give you a hint: true love doesn’t always come in the packages that we expect.<br /><br />The acting is excellent by all. The plot is engaging, intertwining and thought provoking. If you’re not comfortable with churning undercurrents, this may not be the film for you.<br /><br />Oh, help me, Rhonda!  Help, help me, Rhonda!
B00CWVGBEO|1|I didn't actually finish the movie.  It was that bad.  Poor acting, dumb plot.  Arnold is getting old and it shows
B00L9B7IKE|5|This is a captivating book that keeps you guessing the villain until the last few pages.
B000UJ48WC|4|We've all seen this one, know the lines, and you likely have this on VHS and DVD.    That being said; a really good Blu-ray transfer. Shelly Long and that hideaous gaping maw of a mouth has NEVER looked so repulsive. Her giant piano key teeth really pop out during the beginning of this movie. It was the first thing my fiance and I noticed.    Jack Nicholson looks just that much crazier in hi-def. If you like the original film/DVD/VHS this is worthy of your Blu-ray collection.     On a side note - the TV mini-series movie thing is also on DVD. In my opinion it is far superior to Kubrick's rendition of the shining any day. You'll know exactly what I mean if you've read the book. Get this one on Blu-ray and also purchase:    \\"Stephen King's The Shining (Two Disc Special Edition) (1997)\\"    Use the above text in a search on Amazon, it's only $7.50 - you won't be dissapointed!
B00GPWEPZ8|3|When  the author of \\"Mary Poppins\\" comes to see Walt Disney about making her books into a movie, we learn about her childhood and the inspiration for her characters.  She's a rigid sourpuss, immune to the warmth and charms of Mr. Disney, however, and won't even consider the changes he wants.<br /><br />The constant flashbacks to P.L. Travers' childhood are interesting but slow down the main story.  Tom Hanks is utterly lovable as Disney and plays well against Emma Thompson's brittle, control-freak old maid, Travers.  It's fun to see the two pros act together.<br /><br />There is trivia galore for fans of the Mary Poppins movie, but this is actually a very lightweight and inconsequential story, more suited as a \\"extra\\" on the Mary Poppins DVD, rather than a full-length film.  I enjoyed it but have forgotten most of it already.
B0037NVM1I|4|The directors cut includes more explanatory voice-over from Linda Hamilton, cut from the theatrical version, describing the story arc, but it doesn't detract because there is more action too. A great movie!
B00ABGEFWC|5|I love this game. The show on Tv too! Also there are littlest pet shop toys! I'm a big fan of LPS BUT I think the game is better than the toys and the tv show, because you get too busy the pets and play with them, feed them, and wash them it's just so much fun!!! I recommend this game for all ages : )

B0012QVJXS|5|Richard Donner's Superman resonates with me like no other superhero film.  I was 10 years old when I first saw Superman: the movie. It's a FUN movie, filled with instantly accessible and likeable characters.  Clark Kent is the product of his powerful and wise Krypton heritage, and his innocent, character-filled Midwestern adoptive parents.  He has god-like powers, but has a humility that grounds him in the most admirable of ways.  His Kryptonian father has sent him to Earth with presumably all the knowledge and wisdom of the Kryptonian civilization encoded in crystals.  All of this power and knowledge Clark uses to protect and inspire the people of his new home on Earth.  Of all Superman's powers the thing that resonated most with me was a statement he made in a conversation with Lois Lane.  He said he stood for truth, justice and the American way.  Lois, then joked that he would be fighting every politician in Washington, but then comes the kicker, Clark responds, 'Lois,  I never lie.'  That's something I can do!!  I thought.  I can be like Superman by always telling the truth!  This is something that has never left me after all these years.  What a beautiful thing for a film to affirm and inspire virtue in children and adults alike.  Of course there is the perfectly diabolical and yet hillarious portrayal of Lex Luthor by the incomparable Gene Hackman, along with his henchmen, Otis, and Miss Tessmacher.  Everyone in the film, right down to the extras was wonderful.  The effects, well, I still love to watch the opening credits, and there are moments where the flying really seems to work, and there are others where it doesn't.  The set design borders on spectacular at times.  Effects in a film are important for bringing the audience into the story, while lapses can cause us to momentarily disengage, but great effects never of themselves make a film memorable.  There is so much to love about this film that it's easy for me to lovingly overlook any technological shortcomings.  Perhaps someday it will be possible to improve those sequences where the effects kill the illusion.  Some moments in the visuals aside, Superman in a nearly perfect movie, that I highly recommend to anyone.comings.

B008SAZHLQ|5|If you can read this book and not flat out, openly weep then you are a miserable human being. I'm not going to talk about the book though, but I will talk about how it made me feel. Books should make you feel and this one brought all of those feels and set them off like tiny, well placed explosions. I read it in a day, even though I tried to force myself to stop. I had to finish and then wanted more and more and more once I did.
1400069181|3|Blake (not Tom) Mycloskie has written a short but fairy satisfying book that is part company history and part motivational business guide. The nice twist from Mycloskie's perspective is his belief that we are in an era where private companies can directly address public concerns in a constructive way that is mutually beneficial. Most of his ideas seem to be more geared towards new companies and generating inspiration for a way to serve customers and a charitable cause, but he tries to acknowledge that its never a bad time to do a good thing.<br /><br />The part that I found the most interesting was his description of just how barebones you can (and probably should) be when a company is still struggling make it past year one. His stories of handing off the same phone to different people in the same apartment to \\"transfer departments\\" is rather entertaining, and for someone who is still pondering the possibilities, this lays it out pretty plainly. Most people will believe you're the real deal with only a few things, a decent business card, a good website and a clear message. His message about how to treat employees and customers as part of the \\"family\\" of the company is also inspiring, he sounds like a great guy to work for or with.<br /><br />I don't much care for the format that Blake borrows from a number of different motivational books where he'll start a chapter out with \\"let me tell you a story\\" then give you some anecdote that touches on the topic that he's going to cover in detail in that chapter. Its been done to death and I find most anecdotes to be rather uninteresting (I'm interested in HIS insight, not someone else's story).<br /><br />I would only recommend a buy for someone who finds the TOMS story in itself to be interesting. The overall tone is that of one long motivational speech, which isn't bad at times, but you can get that just about anywhere. I'm glad I got a free review copy. This would make a good library read, but I don't think this book offers enough unique value to warrant purchasing. Its good, with a good message, but not great.o warrant purchasing. Its good, with a good message, but not great.
B000B7BRMM|4|The trouble with Christmas albums is that by December 26th they are usually consigned to the CD rack for 11 months -- I fear this may be another.  However, it is a nice album,with good, sensitive arrangements; both with the Clayton~Hamilton Jazz Orchestra{which gets one of the stars awarded this cd) and also with the string section. Diana Krall always exudes CLASS and this album is no exception.  It`s also \\"cute\\" that she finds it difficult to pronounce her \\"R`s\\" (Cwistmas; awound etc). This CD would be ideal as background dinner music or for a late night,romantic drive.  It`s not a great jazz album, but it certainly has good jazz tinges and it is very tasteful.

B008S80OU2|5|Bought this set on Amazon last week. It's quite simply The ultimate Blue Öyster Cult Collection.<br /><br />Comes with an exclusive code to download 4 separate unreleased concerts(52 Tracks) from their website, one of which is from the 1980 Black & Blue tour. The codes are still good as of late February 2014, so they're keeping it going.<br /><br />I own some of the original CDs and LPs, these remasters are so much better.<br /><br />TONS of extras and a fresh remaster makes this indispensable.<br /><br />If you're a big BÖC fan like I am, it's a no-brainer.<br /><br />16 CDs, 1 DVD, some of which are double albums for around $80(was $84.24 when I bought it), you just can't beat it.<br /><br />Buy it now. You won't regret it.

B007I2BZIE|5|I don't normally write reviews but after reading some reviews before I downloaded this album I feel the need to write one.  I think this is an outstanding album.  I usually need to hear an album a few times before I really appreciate it and this one took me two listens to realize how outstanding it is.<br /><br />Let me start by saying this is a band that REALLY needs to be in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame!!  The music is excellent as usual.  Getty, Alex and Neil have not lost a thing with their music.  They are among the best musicians at their craft.  I really enjoy the music on this album more than the previous two efforts.  It is different but that is what all Rush fans have come to appreciate with this band.  Some of my favorite music pieces are The Anarchist, Caravan, Clockwork Angels and Carnies.  They have a good drive and beat.  The Wreckers is a bit more of a medley but I really like it.  I have read some reviews that really did not like the lyrics.  Let me say that I don't think they are on par with Red Barchetta or Spirit of Radio but that is not what this album is about.  I think Neil is showing his songwriting diversity.  And let's face it classic songs are really hard to top and aren't produced every day.  I think the lyrics are very good but not outstanding.  In all I find this album a very good listen and for the past week I have listened to it every night when I get home from work and on my way home.  I think all Rush fans can appreciate this album.
0316044407|5|A beautifully tragic story about a life, a death, and everything that came after. &#34;My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.&#34; With these opening words, you are catapulted into a heartwrenching and yet ever hopeful story about a family trying to cope with the worst tragedy imaginable.<br /><br />Alice Sebold crafts her story brilliantly. From the father who loves his daughter too much to let her go without getting justice, the mother who is too devastated to cope, the sister who desperately wants to get out of her shadow, and the brother too young to understand beyond knowing an important part of his life is missing, this could be any family after a tragic loss. The emotional range and power are tremendous as you take an inside look at a family and community forever altered in some way by a horrible crime.<br /><br />Narrated by Susie Salmon, the reader is given a unique perspective on events, as Susie tells about her life and relates to us what happens on Earth in the aftermath of her death. While it is almost unbearably tragic, it is also full of hope. Life does continue, wounds don't disappear but they do heal, and those left behind can find happiness without forgetting those who they lost. It's a hard book to read in the beginning, but an amazing book to finish.

B00BP4SJKI|4|I first saw 'Peter Pan' in the 1960's, during one of its period re-releases by Disney; and remembered it a a pretty good \\"...kid's film...\\"<br /><br />I recently re-visited this movie, under the prodding of my 11 year-old daughter; and, I am grateful to her for pushing me into it. 'Peter Pan' features beautiful animation, well-choreographed scenes of fight and flight, inspired voice-acting and memorable songs. All of this supports a surprisingly funny and insightful tale of the dangers of either never growing up...or, growing up too much.<br /><br />Katherine Beaumont ('Alice In Wonderland') is beguiling as teenage Wendy Darling; whose childhood infatuation with tales of Peter Pan develop into a relatable (if very 1950's) teen crush. Bobby Driscoll, who was a well-known Disney child star, turns in a completely winning performance as Peter Pan. He captures all the bravado, hubris, good humor, pettiness, generosity and pure sense-of-fun that run chock-a-block through all teenage boys. The characterization of Tinkerbell (insanely jealous of Wendy and possessive of Peter) creates a very believable teen-age triangle; and, some welcome pungency to offset Disney's penchant for treacle. However, the prize goes to Hans Conried in the twin roles of Mr. Darling (Wendy's veddy, veddy British father), and Peter's nemesis: Captain James Hook. As Hook, Conried creates a truly great villain: charming, scheming, ferocious, vengeful, cunning and (where the hungry crocodile is concerned) hysterically nervous.<br /><br />Comments about the 'Indian' scenes are justified...but, not to the extent that Politically Correct critics condemn. The song: \\"What makes the red man, red\\" is classic (i.e. insensitive and stereotypical) Hollywood 'injun' stuff. That said, Candy Candido's floor-scraping vocals as 'Big Chief' are a pure hoot; and, should be taken in that spirit.<br /><br />Bottom line: 'Peter Pan' is one of Disney's most completely realized and satisfying movies. Its fun, insightful, exciting, speaks equally well to kids, teens and adults and does so without the sugary wallowing that came to epitomize subsequent Disney animation. Watch it, and smile.citing, speaks equally well to kids, teens and adults and does so without the sugary wallowing that came to epitomize subsequent Disney animation. Watch it, and smile.
B005XQLBU4|5|the upgrades come at good times. just enough to stay ahead of the onslaught! gets a little repetitious but in short bursts its fun
0316228532|2|I must be too dumb to appreciate all the nuances within this book.  It has taken me forever to figure out the complexities within each of the characters and how they relate to one another.  I am so over it and don't think I'll even attempt to finish it.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I  enjoy this game. It does take patience, but it is well worth it.
B005CRQ3NY|5|Dog days was a good book and I would share it with all my friends but half of them are already fans of this series like I am. The other half haven't read them yet and I suggest they see a doctor
0143123173|4|This is my first Craig Johnson novel and it is truly a delight.  His characters are engaging, the dialogue is fun, witty and crisp.  His main character Walt Longmire is the charming mix of down home, like a modern day Andy Griffith, deceptively laidback but never misses anything.  It is truly a pleasure to read it.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I didn't think the detective/mystery aspect of it was as engaging or suspenseful as some other authors.  I think good mysteries are a bit like reading poetry, everybody has their own taste for certain types.  I really enjoyed the novel and will likely read some more of his novels.
0452289963|5|I've read this author before and was mildly pleased with his insights but this book was not his usual \\"milk toast\\" offerring. If you're ready, and truly seeking, you will not be disappointed. If you're not ready and don't \\"get it\\", put the book aside and try again later when you are ready. This is knowledge that will change your life.
B007KOMTUI|5|It is wonderful to escape to the 1950s but it is also depressing.<br /><br />We can't stop watching madmen - the style, drama, etc. have hooked us.......it makes us appreciate the benefits of today.
B00BGZ8OLA|5|Rarely does the movie equal the book, but the direction and cinematography were simply amazing.  Thrilling and thought provoking as well.  Be aware that there are graphic and disturbing scenes involving animals.
6301025083|5|The best film I've ever seen! Need I say more
B00FAPF5U0|5|Finally!!! I stopped using Kindle because it didn't have Candy Crush. Just picked it up tonight and saw the app!!! Kindle will now be used again.
B00BC254I8|1|I'm a fan of Mike's. I've seen him fight. I've followed his career. I also kind of enjoyed his acting. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of this book. I had three issues with this book.<br /><br />1. This book is about Mike and his picture is on the cover. I wanted to hear the book in his voice. I don't know if the person who helped Mike write the book didn't take enough effort to write the book in Mike's &#34;voice&#34; or what, but there were parts of the book that were odd and definitely not Mike.<br />2. The book is filled with one bad behavior story after another after another. Mike didn't seem to really take any responsibility for his actions, feel any remorse or learn anything from events from his life. He didn't have respect for anyone, including himself.  Even years later looking back on it nothing really changed. he confirmed that his bad boy savage image is really who he is and not just an image. It also seemed that he was trying to make money by shocking us with all the bad stories.  This is the kind of book that I would expect from a no talent celebrity like kim Kardashian not a great athlete like Mike.<br />3. This book is almost 600 pages. This book didn't need to be 600 pgs.<br /><br />Sorry Mike
1400064627|4|I thought I knew what I was getting into when I started this novel, but I had no idea! I watched the movie about ten years ago and really couldn't remember too much about it besides there being a tom boy, a railroad accident and a nursing home. What I couldn't remember was the heart of the story... And wow, what a story! I must admit that when I realized I was going to be reading about the lives of two lesbians I almost gave up on the book. I'm so glad I didn't! Thankfully, this story wasn't a lesbian romance. It was a story about family and love and being happy with who you are. I wish I was able to more emotionally connect with the characters though. I wasn't too crazy about the layout of the story and spent a lot of time confused trying to figure out who was who in three generations of characters. I felt like all the newspaper articles and different narrations did give the story a more authentic feel though. In the end I was left with a smile on my face after I turned the last page and it was worth the time I spent reading it.<br /><br />I must get my hands on some friend green tomatoes and give them a try!<br /><br />P.S. I found Evelyn to be extremely irritating! What a weak, pathetic and annoying woman! I'm so glad I don't have to read about her complaining anymore
B003XF1XOQ|2|I guess it is targeted at a young audience but still thought it was a poor book. It felt like the author wasn't sure how to end it once katniss was in the city. I hadn't read the other two so can't compare them.
B00AFCEIB0|4|Everyone who is anyone likes the Google search engine. I use it everyday. I also like Google Images.<br />Always in proper working condition
B009UX2YAC|5|I am so addicted to this game its tons of fun. I recommend this game to everyone that loves to play apps
B005BDZN62|5|A classic that's well restored in color and in 5.1 surround sound.
B008VBYN80|4|it is fun my plays it not me its a little confusing I'm kaitlyn mayor I'm 6 I don't get this game a lot bye love you merry christmas
B000065BPB|5|Excellent product. Sound quality for PC gaming with Klipsch THX speaker control is outstanding, and the 9 foot cord allows for sitting well back of a 24\\" monitor.
B009FZHYKU|5|love all the season but this one was amazing  waiting for october yeah me love it love it love it
B002MQYOFW|5|This is a MUST read series. The first book is probably the best in my opinion. I could not put this book down.
1416594787|5|Dawkins presents a reasoned, easy to understand explanation of what evolutionary theory is all about, and more than enough information to forever debunk the \\"it's just a theory\\" folks.  As someone who has been frustrated about the inability to convince people, this helps me understand a lot of the central proofs, and also that some people will just never submit their \\"faith\\" to \\"reason\\".  A beautiful book.
B003H4I4JU|4|really interesting play on various cultural pieces.  Important to know your enemy.  It either avoids conflict leading to a peace or is valuable if conflict remains necessary.
B000002TQV|1|sorry, it just aint music real music is korn
B00JAQJMJ0|5|Phenomenal film.
B00LU0P9L4|4|Game flowed easily from scene to scene. Good graphics, color and detail. Gameplay had right amount of difficulty but was not so hard as to be impossible to figure out moves or where to go next.  Enjoyed it.
B000J3OTTQ|5|very sexy movie with lots of dancing!one sad part that will put a tear in your eye!
B000X5SPBI|5|yes my dvdwas great I love the show now season 9 is on the way cant wait<br />charlene
0783230079|5|This movie is awesome which is why I wanted it in our DVD library.  It's a good classic and clean for the whole family.
0618918248|1|Dawkins skillfully exploits America's post 9-11 stress disorder.      He directs all self-righteous wrath on brainwashed religious retarded fanatics blaming them in all the sins and troubles of America.      But he misses the point since religious does not mean religious fanatic or even somebody rejecting science and evolution. I do wholeheartedly accept both science and the theory of evolution and even despite all your skepticism in my ability to face your \\"immaculate argumentation\\", I do carefully read your book and will do it again six-seven times to able to expose all the paucity, narrow-mindedness  and aggressiveness of your atheistic worldview.      My God is a god of my heart, it is an Archetype of culture or spirituality which has nothing to do with science or even the outside reality in general.  Trying to prove or disprove God scientifically is like trying to prove Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  And I go to the synagogue and sorry for my fanaticism, I am ready to die for this privilege. Ready to die because it saved me from killing people in Afghanistan when I was sent to there by Soviet government. And my spiritual and moral convictions gave me power to defeat the Soviet army (disobey the orders and survive) and I'm proud of it.      And don't tell me which ideals I should carry in my heart: sorry, I have very high IQ in order to decide: as we say it in Hebrew I have been in your movie once. All your arguments are word by word repeating the theory of scientific atheism I was forced to listen in the country where my granny was imprisoned for just being a daughter of a rabbi.      You totally reveal yourself in your counting Einstein and other scientist as atheists Mr. Dawkins, though they have never ever considered themselves as such.  You say they were ashamed to tell the world their truth, but you know it better. How smart for you!!! Maybe absolutely opposite is true: as an educated Jew from the secularizing German society Einstein was ashamed of hisreligiosity?     Only two kinds of people were assured in their right to talk on behalf of others without any cast on doubt: communists and fascists. Only they knew the final truth and the way to make everybody happy.  Now point me to the concentration camp I should go, Parteigenosse!    Is it too far fetched, insulting and intolerant? But that is the only natural reaction on the insults and intolerance of your book.  By the way, in 60-ies so called fundamental Islam was virtually non-existing - it's rise is a reaction on what is perceived as thread and intolerant attack on traditional values, so next time you will give a lecture, please think about it: who contributes to further rise of it and future 9-11, Mr. Dawkin.
B0064X7FVE|5|Love love love being able to check the weather anytime.  Live in the mountains and the weather changes all the time from hour to hours sometimes.  Great!
B00DR0PDNE|5|I love this thing.
030758836X|3|A really loooong set up, then an interesting twist, then a quick semi-wrap and.... where's the end?  There's no end? Really?  The author just left it hang like that?<br /><br />Well written and entertaining but the author is a bit verbose and she definitely likes a literary phrase. The lack of an ending really, REALLY ticked me off though. I've read open-ended stories where that was appropriate, here it just seemed lazy.<br /><br />Rating 2.5 and the writing is good enough to round up to 3.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Nice
B00BEZTMQ8|4|A lengthy introduction to the Hobbit story.  Great for fans of the novel but perhaps a bit slow-paced for the casual viewer.
B0070UFMOW|5|For the price, this is a good deal. There aren't a lot of choices in this price range that will deliver as much sound quality as this little gem.  Go For It..
B002BU0DPE|5|This is the only gaming utility that i have ever truly felt was worth what it costs. i love this headset. the options are amazing, the setup is EASY, and with these turtle beaches there is NO hissing sound as there was before. i would recommend this to anyone and everyone. If your thinking about this and your are an avid online gamer, BUY THEM! thats all i can say. 100% worth it. I stay alive longer on games lke socom due to the fact that i can here footsteps REALLY clear sneaking up on me. and things like c4 charge planing \\"Click\\" noises. Its a great product! thats all i gotta say.
1476734941|4|I liked the concept.  I just couldn't do it long term.
B003M5AXN4|5|After having grown up on the classic cartoon (mainly due to my older brothers) I was very surprised to find that I liked this move immensely.  It's not Lawrence of Arabia, to be sure, but it really has the spirit of Speed Racer and the visuals to match.  Visually, this movie will knock you on your duff in no time flat.  I just wish a re-release would tender a Dolby TrueHD audio track.  Even with the Dolby Digital mix that is used, though, you might not even notice.  Definitely a worthy flick if you are a fan of the old series!
B005IQZB14|5|I felt like I was on the trail with the author. Her feelings- both emotional and physical were conveyed so well.
B00005JOA0|5|I am happy with this purchase - enjoyed the video and the shipping was fast and the item arrived safely and in great condition...I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves English type movies.
B002CGSYNU|1|This lens cap did not fit the lens size mentioned online.
B006LSZECO|2|I prefer to read a novel where I actually like one or more of the main characters.  I did not like, nor feel any sympathy for, either of the main characters in this book.  It was an interesting writing style, but not one that I found that captured my interest.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|more please from Christian's point of view
B00KYYS2VG|5|Excellent console quality game. The graphics are impressive for a mobile game and the music, design, and narration give it a sense of magic. My daughter and I have really enjoyed playing this on our Kindle Fire TV.
B000095K7A|5|Time has been very kind to this album; it's almost hard to believe this album is more than a decade old.  Like a soundtrack to a 16-bit video game mixed with the sensibilities of a John Hughes movie, Give Up's beats chirp and hum along happily while the singer sings tales of love and love lost.<br /><br />The vinyl itself is quality.  It features the recently remastered version, pressed to (what feels like) 180g wax.  Sure, this isn't the recent ( and more expensive) anniversary edition, but aside from a couple of great B-sides (the Iron & Wine cover of &#34;Such Great Heights&#34; and the &#34;Against All Odds&#34; cover come to mind), most of the bonus tracks are not essential.<br /><br />Regardless, the remastered album sounds better than ever.  Keep in mind that this album was recorded in parts and shared over CD-Rs via snail mail, and the original version of this album somewhat suffered in sound quality for it.  This is the definitive Give Up.
006145205X|5|The Rational Optimist is an inspired polemic, grand in conception and sweeping in its historical depth. It divides into two basic sections: First, why did humans, among all species, develop \\"progress\\"? Secondly, given our propensity to raise our standard of living and innovate, is there any basis for the popular pessimism that claims we are at a turning point?<br /><br />First progress. The basic idea is that, given a critical mass of population, our collective brains will be able to work in a way that an individual cannot. The collective whole is greater than the sum of the thinking parts. Specialization and an increased standard of living will result - provided they are not stifled. Ridley traces the history of this concept from the stone age to the development of agriculture, cities, the industrial revolution and to the present. He also demonstrates his point by way of counter example: what can go wrong? Depopulation and isolation, as in the case of the Tasmanian aborigines, led to a loss of technology - regression. Repressive government led to stagnation in the case of the Ming dynasty. But the central point is optimism: the more you prosper the more you can prosper. The potential for generating ideas is infinte.<br /><br />The second part addresses the issue of pessimism. Ridley shows that pessimism is not new. In the 19th century, for example, \\"peak coal\\" was a concern just as peak oil is now. Coal would run out in ten years, it was thought in 1865. Sound familiar? More recently acid rain was a source of alarm, followed by a hole in the ozone layer, followed by globalization. Then came Y2K. One by one alarm was quelled only to be replaced by another. The current cause is global warming. Ridley skillfully avoids getting drawn into the debate. He uses the confess and avoid tactic. His claim is that, even if the worst case scenario of the IPCC were to occur, the outcome would unlikely be catastrophic. Humans have the power to adapt.<br /><br />Ridley is a fine writer. His prose is cogent, terse and intelligible. He does not get lost in vapid speculation or idle digression. No doubt the book's contentious nature will provoke hostile reaction. Those who are convinced that we are heading for the abyss will not be mollified with Ridley's reason. For those who suspect that the world isn't such a bad place, this book will reinforce your optimism.t, terse and intelligible. He does not get lost in vapid speculation or idle digression.

0590353403|5|I found not only this one, but all of the HARRY POTTER book's breathtaking, thrilling, and enchanting. At some points I forgot it was fiction. That's how trapt you get in the story! I could not put it down (somewhat normal for me) but, not as much as these. I read the last one in  two days! The character felt so alive that you cry, laugh,and even feel  their rage, also many other feelings. This is a fast moving fantasy that  really captures the readers heart and puts it in the book.  Reading it then  makes it all the better.
B00MU9R5OI|5|This game rocks!!
B000NTPDSW|5|I got this collection as a gold box deal!!! I've been looking for all 3 in a collection for a while now and they are so expensive. $17 and I was hitting the buy it before I knew it. Happy girl!!!
B00EQ0CKRQ|3|I got this game for 99 cents but now it is free. It is actually the best racing game series on tablets, so that's pretty good. This is actually my favorite game on the app store until I paid for it and now it's free.
B00913DPW2|5|The only thing that could make the game better is more tutorial.  I didn't know the game can't be completed without all 99 puzzle pieces and I also didn't know that clicking on the Moth will tell you how many pieces are in the room.<br /><br />I did complete the game and yes, I had to use a w/t for some of it - but the game allows you to take your time and really enjoy yourself!<br /><br />I'm glad to have played it and started The Haunt 2 last night!  I am all excited that The Haunt 3 will be released soon!!<br /><br />5-Stars for sure!!
B00AREIAI8|4|I personally love it!!!!! I'm very very very serious! Even though it may be a little slow and the graphics could be better, I for one suggest it to others and totally love it.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|This was one of the first apps I downloaded once I got my. kindle.  I love being able to play offline.  I also love that my crops don't die.  This app was free for me but I would have gladly paid money for it.  I also love that I don't have to spend money to advance.  It may take me a while but I'm not in a hurry.
B00JB3MVCW|1|What a waste of 2 hours. The story was nothing like the real biblical story and not very well done to boot.
B000J159N8|5|I had the privilage to meet the wife of Lt. Col. Frank Vaverk. He was a member of the 7th Cav. and was in the battle shown in the movie and was friends with several officers there. I have the deepest respect for soldiers that are brave and devoted to duty. They are the reason we enjoy freedom. God Bless them and keep them safe. I must say the movie brought me to tears because it was so realistic.  Thanks  Joseph
B0000085N4|5|I have always loved these guys and been wanting this cd for a long time so i finally got it and it was well worth.......it
1101946342|5|Forget the critics! If you loved the FSOG trilogy,  Grey will not disappoint.  Christian's POV is more exciting and adds an9ther layer to the story. I've read it 4 x now and cannot wait for the next Grey book.

After reading this book I love him as a person now. Not many people can come from where he did and rise to such success in the hardest business in the world to make a livin. Music.

B007SOQBCM|4|It's a great app... No way to subscribe though... overall it has some opening troubles every once in  awhile...  but mostly a really good app
B0042TV4IW|5|Clean, uplifting drama. Characters have depth and good hearts. I find myself trying to exercise greater patience and wisdom in my own life - to assume good motives of others after watching!
B009ZQC7MY|5|Like reading a good book you can't put down. Delicious!
B00005JPAM|3|Nothing could be me fitting to see a movie about British politics on the U.S.A. election day in the rain.  The title of this movie was deceptive as it concentrated almost exclusively on the week after Daian was killed in the car crash in Paris.  When I bought the ticket, I said \\"I have come to see the Queen.\\"    We met her (played superbly by Helen Mirren) on Tony Blair's first day in office.  After being elected as Prime Minister of Britain, he is shown down on his knee asking Queen Elizabeth's permission to be \\"her\\" Prime Minister.  It was a factitious meeting to say the least.    The actor who portrasyed Blair was cute (showed a lot of teeth) and matured as the events occurred and he had to speak to the world on the family's behalf.  He was marvelous.  Diana died August 30, 1997, a lovely but deluded young woman who'd been ostracized by the royal family.  The monarchy watched t.v. like the rest of the world as they stayed in seclusion out in the country.  The Queen had deemed it a private Spenser family funeral, even though Charles had to remind her  of their responsibility, that Diana had been the loving mother of the future King of England.    As the Queen finally came to terms that she must make an appearance by September 4th, as worldwide disapproval was increasing, she shed a few tears (as I did when my ex mother-in-law died) and a beautiful stag appeared as a prominition.  It showed her humanity, though the whole family were old fashioned and set in their ways:  harsh, uncaring, in denial, thinking only of themselves instead of the two sons of Diana.    Blair carried on in a remarkably mature manner which won him many American admirers; almost ten years since those happenings, and he will retire in 2007.  He is almost as great now as Winston Churchill, even with his pajama top on which BLAIR was on the back.  He had a supportive wife and called Diana \\"the people's princess.\\"  Plans were changed from private to a public funeral despite the Queen's cold attitute.      It was very moving to see her looking at the mountain of flowers outside the gates of Balmoral Castle and to have her stand, \\"the flag,\\" at half staff.  It was a minute-by-minute, day by day account of that terrible tragedy and repercussions in September, 1997.  We will always remember the televised coverage just as we watched the beautiful wedding some years prior, which led up to this miserable day, and the funeral proceedings of JFK in 1962.    Some things are so remarkable that you can't get them erased from your memory, and the pain is always there.  I wasn't expecting this when I went to the movie, as I avoid painful memories in my subconscious as much as I can.  I could not see the 9-11 movie, but sometimes after we re-live emotional, painful situations there is a cleansing which is theraputic -- and this movie fits the bill in that aspect.  Go see it, or buy the video.  It is a good, though different, interpretation of how Diana was finally made a \\"Queen\\" in spirit.  Long Live The Queen in Heaven and on earth.
B00F35B8F8|4|It got pretty good towards the end.
B000VWYNOG|3|...and he didn't here, either. But wat are tracks 1 and 2 doing on this &#34;Greatest Hits&#34;ollection?<br />I bought it for just one song: &#34;Somebody Like  You&#34;
B00D7Z4GQY|5|This is a riveting novel with how the elements keep the reader fascinated to the very end. Beautifully written, wonderful character development, the best books I've read in a very long time.
0783242808|3|I didn't see the rated version so I don't can't tell you what the difference is. This movie is your basic high school comedy. Eugene Levy does an awesome job as the father who does a great job during all the embarassing scenes.  There is one nude scene which shows a girl topless. The language is raunchy as is fitting for a high school movie. However, the language was pornographic when one girl tells what she did during music camp. The unrated version is NC-17.
B001NHNG64|4|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose themselves to the plot and manipulation of the characters to the point you're thinking you can help our hero somehow.
B0050AV5MW|4|I loved reading this series although there were times when the author seemed to get too bogged down in minutae and lost me a little. Wished I hadnt then gone on to read book 5 which has a dismal ending.
B00H48ES7C|5|I am so happy to have found this game again. Haven't played it since 2000! This is really a great game.
B004SJ3BCI|5|can't beat free, right? my whole family is addicted to this game. we all help each other beat the levels.
B0024FAR5M|2|The hype on this show was amazing. I should check it out. I'm sorry I did. One of the cheesiest shows I  have seen. It was just horrible. And the obvious cliches are laughable. I could only make it through 2 episodes. I must say that the constant joint smoking is obviously a push toward the writers direction. Just laughable.<br />It's amazing people find any value or in the least,entertainment, in this joke.<br /><br />All in all...Horrible,horrible(and I didn't even mention the violence).Whew this is really bad. If you are interested in watching this series, be warned...
B0013FBS20|5|good
B005GSZZ1A|5|This story of survival was a tough one to read; however, the world needs to know what is going on in North Korea and other places like it. I commend Shin Dong-hyuk for sharing his difficult struggle and his successful escape out of Camp 14 and North Korea.
B009MF5BXK|5|Great movie.  My husband loves it.  He had already seen the first one, and was very excited to see this sequel.  Thanks for great service and fast shipping.
B000J10ERO|5|Despite the fact that I spent way too much time on IMDB reading spoilers for this movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly when I saw it in a theatre and even more the other two times I saw it. Singer effectively showed both the strapping, smiling public face of Superman as well as his troubled private life which was a result of his absence and also the fact that he can never be like everyone else. <br /> <br />The last 15 minutes were too maudlin for my taste, nevertheless, the movie did everything I hoped it would. It paid tribute to the Christopher Reeve movie that I loved as a kid, added menace to Lex Luthor and unapologetically ramped up Superman's powers. <br /> <br />A great movie, and the behind the scene feature was highly entertaining as well thanks to Singer giving us full access and chiming in from time to time as well.
B00DGNOMB6|3|Well credentialed cast, good performances but a story line that will not have you on the edge of your chair.  It helps to be over 60.  Enjoyed it though.  Dreyfuss?  Its been a long time since American Graffiti and Jaws!
B0074QGGK6|5|Very nice little book and great experience!
B00BSBXZDY|3|It was kind of cute.  More for young children instead of junior high.

B00DR0PDNE|5|Love it.
B0054JZC6E|4|wanted some easy games to play. some of them are not as easy as I thought, but decent for free
B008TRUDAS|5|I loved this book! The title caught my attention so I read the description of the book.  I had no idea what Slammed poetry was but decided to take a chance anyway. I totally lost myself in this book. This book is wonderfully written. The characters came alive and became friends I wanted to be in my life and never leave. The romance is beautiful and real.  The author makes it possible to actually feel every emotion as you take the journey with Will and Layken as they fall in love. I felt like I was young and in love again for the first time.  The real world fell away as I read the book in one sitting!  I am on to the sequel, Point of Retreat.
B00A27X972|5|I could not remember why I bought this book.however was bored and it was on the kindle.wow it sneaked up on me and I could not put it down. Will recommend it to one of my book clubs
B006PTL1GC|3|I liked the movie somewhat, but it just seemed to slowly fall into soft-core porn
B00OIG3CAC|5|Howard Shore's composition is most inspiring and touches the center of emotional expression displayed by the characters on the screen and those in the viewing audience.
B008XG1X18|5|Yay Android for getting a Pinterest app!! Ive been checking every so often for the app and I'm so glad its finally there!!!
B006LSZECO|2|I am not sure you want me to rate this book.  There were way too many f and b words that were unnecessary.  I really disike devious people and that was what Amy was.  I wanted to just stop reading it, but I wanted to give the author a chance to redeem himself.  So I finished it but am none the better for doing it.
B005C5A6C0|5|excelent album.
0596009208|2|The book has a very interesting layout. The issues is with the code. What is supposed to work, does not. Once again somebody forgot to test the code. Not sure what is wrong with it as I am learning the language. Even most of the the reference code does not work.
B004TI5N38|4|I gave this book 4 stars because I enjoyed it but do not consider it one of the best books I've ever read. The characters were well defined. I've enjoyed most of Baldacci's.
B008Y2X78S|5|Quite an intense look into the criminal elements busy during the Prohibition era.
B009UX2YAC|4|Unlike other free running games, this game does not make you spend ridiculous prices to win.
B00SH00N3Y|2|decent but akward beginning, not a great finish, i was dissapointed
B009ZQ8FQG|5|The turmoil is exhausting, but the period being portrayed is enticing and the acting superb.<br /><br />The estate and automobiles are fabulous.<br /><br />I believe I could commence watching season 1 and 2 again.
B00B22ASUM|5|This book had me laughing out loud!  It also had me in tears (of joy).  I sent an email to every person in my contacts telling them to read this book.  I've NEVER done that before.  I was reading this book in the car as my husband and I were on a 5 hour road trip.  He was listening to sports on the radio while I read.  I realized that almost every page I was telling him something that was going on.  Finally, my husband shut off the radio and I read the story to him out loud.  Yes, all the way to Boston and all the way back (10 Hours)!!!  A couple of days passed and he asked me when we were going to finish the book. I also have to add that during an intermission at a play we went to, he caught me reading it while he was gone and stated that I was not allowed to read it without him!  We loved it!!!!  Anyway, I'd love to meet Bob (and James) someday soon in person.
B0040FMG2G|3|Sometimes hard to understand, but good costumes and depiction of history.<br /><br />Best line is, &#34;Is that his brains?&#34;
B001XRLWPQ|5|I love this show. My husband and I just recently discovered it on re-runs on TNT. We had missed a few so we purchased all seasons so we could get caught up.
B008UCJ7KO|4|After reading the first two in the series I couldn't wait for June 4th for the final book.  It was amazing and everything I had waited for until...spoiler alert...I found there is now a 4th!
B00008S2VG|3|IVE BEEN A MADONNAS FAN FOR MANY YEARS, AND TO TELL THE TRUTH WHEN I LISTENED THE ENTIRE ALBUM I WAS JUST DISAPOINTED, I EXPECTED A BETTER WORK, BETTER SONGS AND RITHMS.IT SEEMS SHE IS BORED OF MAKING GOOD MUSIC. THE ONLY RESCATABLE TRACKS ARE &quot;LOVE PROFUSSION&quot; &quot;NOTHING FAILS&quot; THE REST SOUND JUST THE SAME. I LIKE MADONNA BUT I DIDNT LIKE THIS ALBUM.FOR EXCELLENT MUSIC, BUY CHERS &quot;LIVING PROOF&quot;, AND ITS SINGLES.
B008Y2VTIS|5|it was excellent
B00FAPF5U0|4|easy relaxing game
B000002LCI|5|DM has anchored my cd collection for 16 years and is this 30 year old's favorite band.  Music for the Masses, to me, is their quintessential album and an excellent introduction for newbies. For those of us who appreciate  their middle years when they had perfected their trademark sound, this fine  offering has it all. Operatic, sweeping, and epic, their unique dark beat  pulses throughout. The hypnotic effect worked by Never Let Me Down Again is  complemented by the austerely mysterious longing of Little 15 and the  pleading of I Want you Now. There are, surprisingly to some, 'light'  moments on the album w/ Pleasure Little Treasure causing brief uplifting  only to be plunged downward once more by the heavy, introspective To Have  and To Hold. Pimpf introduces one to beautiful piano and then the sonic  subtleties of a desperate work camp, complete with swaying chants. But, my  favorite of the album and also of the band themselves, is Strangelove.  Combining the boys' patent kinky take on love and lust, it throbs forth  infectiously, daring one to ... \\"give in to sin, because I like to practice  what I preach.\\" The DM mystique bloomed fully after the release of this  album and their subsequent tour. Their follow up live album 101 contains  the concert versions of the majority of these songs.  Similar offerings can  be heard in later songs like Halo and It's No Good. As the guys continue to  press on it's enjoyable to go back and listen to some milestones. Highly  recommended.
B0025KVLTC|5|Was there any other band in the history of rock and roll that evolved as fast as The Beatles?  Within a few short years, the Liverpool lads would go from making simple pop music (VERY good pop music, mind you) to creating the most influential music in history.  Revolver is an important step in that process and contains some of my favorite Beatles' songs, including \\"She Said She Said\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Taxman\\", and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\".  Not only was the music amazing, but Revolver was a technical masterpiece as well, employing the latest recording techniques of the day.<br /><br />Revolver was the first of the 2009 Beatles' remasters I purchased, replacing my original CD version.  In my opinion, the remaster is far superior to the original CD release.  There's more separation between the instruments, each now having a distinct voice.  It's almost like being in the room with the band while they're playing.  The recordings just feel a little more alive to me now, with subtle details I hadn't noticed on the original CD.  My one complaint with the reissue packaging would be the lack of a plastic tray to insert the CD into.  Sliding the discs in and out of the cardboard sleeve will eventually lead to scratching, so I've taken to storing the discs themselves separate from the artwork to better preserve them.  The album booklets are printed on thick glossy paper for a nice effect, but I don't think the packaging would have been spoiled by the addition of that plastic tray.  I've seen plenty of other albums that are a combination of cardboard and plastic that look just fine.<br /><br />The album is amazing and sounds better on CD than it ever has before.  Highly recommended.
B005IQZB14|4|I could not put the book down!!
B0064QNS62|4|Please add Chromecast compatibility to this app.  That would make this the perfect app.  I would definitely give it 5 stars once it had Chromecast capabilities.
B0063GORYU|5|This is my game of choice!<br />I hesitated to try it, but now I am hooked!<br />Enjoyable, fun and addicting!
B00AEFVRB2|2|Horrible Movie!!!!!  Best scene is the drumstick scene, if you get that far.  I already wasted most of my time, what was 15 min more.  I will NEVER get this time of my life back!
B008MEM24S|5|Fun and I love how they give you a mini story or line. I would recommend this for any age.
B007RE0SCW|5|It is a great product. good packaging, good price,absolutely, I recommend it. . . . . . . . .
B004QOB8SO|3|Fair sherlock movie
B009ZXT4BY|1|Cheesy game. Stick figures.  Reminds me of Atari Games back in those days. Very tired game. Pong comes to mind.
B00992CF6W|5|This is an awesome games for kindle but the updates come really slow but still and awesome game. If I could  I would've given it 50 stars. If you don't have it get it now!
B008JGSM6G|5|This is the most addictive game I have ever played!  Early stages are easy but if you stick with it you will be challenged!
B00KX4TORI|5|well made, strong built, doesn't bend. Fits the USB port in the computer or Surface nicely and sturdy. I got 3. one for the TV, one for the computer (back) and one for the surface so I don't have to keep removing it to plug and unplug.
B00004VWAF|5|this album is undoubtedly one of the most controversial albums ever released by Miles. many people were pissed off because it was not jazz. but with music this good, who really cares what label it's given? this is truly astonishing album that sets the standard high for improvisational funk. Miles and band set the meter to 'hot' and never really let up for the entire duration of it's playing time. there are lots of weird little percussive jams going while the keyboardist splashes a bit of colour here and there and the bass keeps it steady while Davis just commands the ship and chimes in with his 2 cents now and then. On The Corner is such a freaky album and i think it just went over most people's heads back when it was released. it probably still goes above most people's head 30 years later. this album (like alot of Miles's electric period) requires deep listening and an appreciation for music that stretches beyond what is safe. this is dirty and gritty music that feels like the humid stench of fresh asphalt burning on the sticky summer streets. you cannot ignore the genius of this record. listen with an open mind and it will own you.
1582406723|4|The series (which does get a lot better) starts of with a police standoff. Rick Grimes and his partner Shane are shooting at a man with a man in a truck with a rifle. The man takes a well-aimed blow, and hits Shane in the hand, knocking his gun out the same hand. The second shot, which Shane cannot now deflect, hits Rick right in the guts.<br /><br /> Rick then wakes up in a hospital. He searches around. When he gets to the cafeteria, he opens the door, (which had been locked for a reason) only to find it filled to the brim with the dead. Well, living dead. Turns out, he'd been in a coma for about a month. And so begins Image's epic The Walking Dead.<br /><br /> Yes, the first volume is the worst (so far, I'm only on volume 5) but it is a good beginning. And it is the volume that deals the most with the actual zombies. (As you read farther into the series, the zombies become a sort of backdrop, and a more sinister sort of villain takes place: how far would you go to survive?)<br /><br /> There are many characters in this series, and that's the sole problem with it. Like the remake of Dawn of the Dead, there are too may characters! The later volumes do what needs to be done though; they'll devote an issue (the volumes collect 4-5 issues of the monthly series) to a small group of characters, switching off between the many seen throughout the whole series.<br /><br /> Although this is the worst volume (still is 4 stars!!!) the series works out it's problems later, proving to be an amazing series not just about zombies, but about the essence of mankind itself. Grade: A-.
B00B7FOQCK|5|This is a great item.  It works as advertised and provides enough ports to connect all my devices.  Its the latest 3.0 USB hub that is jus tplug and play and it was at a grood price.  The shipping was fast and arrived when earlier than I expected.
B00B4VI8MQ|5|it is a fun game to play. a lot of searching.I didn't think I would like it but you can have fun and waste time doing so
B00001OH7U|5|I have the album version of this from the 80s...it was so great to get this, and here DB version of Wild is the Wind, along with all the other great hits.
B005LAIHEA|5|A very funny and well written film by Jason Segal and his partner. Really shows the extent of the muti talented Segal's career.
B008JFUS5A|5|A great movie.  I loved the first movie and I loved this one two.  I also have read and loved the books trilogy, so I can't wait for the third movie.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It is just like flappy bird get this app it is awesomely amazing so if u r looking for flappy bird and can't find this download this app
B00003CXI1|3|I saw the movie before ever reading a single book. I liked it I supposed, but it was just OK. After reading the book, I did find that the movie was pretty much spot on in regards to translating it from book to screen. The characters were perfectly cast I thought and I loved the score. I am still a huge HP fan regardless so I will watch this movie again and again if I happened to catch it on TV.
B00EDUTGB2|4|IT WORKS AND FOR FREE..... HOW CAN YOU BEAT THAT?  EVEN THOUGH THE AMAZON REP TOLD ME I NEEDED IT, AFTER I READ THE GUIDE QUITE A BIT MORE I FOUND OUT THAT I DON'T NEED THE APP WITH THE NEWER KINDLE FIRE HDX.
B003YL4LYI|5|A Song of Ice and Fire is in the class of books with Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.
B00169N0BK|3|The box that it came in was open so it is hard to tell if it was used or a brand new product. Other than that everything else is okay so far.
B0038BBA4I|5|Mumford & Sons is the most creative and cohesive band out there today. I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert, and it was an absolute honor to hear these guys play live. \\"Sigh No More\\" is an absolute masterpiece, with each of its songs containing intriguing melodies and contemplative lyrics that are easy to relate to. They make it so easy to connect to the music and the band members themselves. One of the things that makes them so refreshing is that they are so modest, and they play beautiful and honest music simply because it's their passion. I have always been a huge fan of all genres of music, but no band/musician has ever impacted me as Mumford & Sons has. Their second album can't come soon enough.
B006BGZJJ4|1|I bought this cable because the original one that comes with the kindle, died.  The new replacement cable has a bad connection to my kindle. My solution was to use this cable for my cell phone, which charges faster even with the bad connection, and use the cell phone's cable to charge the kindle.
B000VI70X6|5|Bought this for present for a friend. It is such a great upbeat DVD and really gets the party going.
B00EXVZZE8|1|I got this app for free on my iPad, the fact that I paid for this shows a bias. I was okay forking over a buck but seriously istom games? The ads are still pesky on an app that actually paid for? If I paid for an app that is free on iPad I definitely expect to get my money's worth with maybe an ad free game. But no you decide to include the ads to a paid game just so you can make more money.<br />Incredibly selfish!! I definitely will not be looking forward to any games by greedy istom.
B00004YLIU|5|Only one thing to say about this album other than it is terrific! Would have been nice to know that the lp is smaller than expected but still plays on the normal setting. I was worried up until the moment it was played that it wasn't going to work. It was a gift purchased a good amount of time in advance. It would have saved me the headache had it read as such in the body of its description.
B00D41AJ7G|5|I purchased this game and my  kids love the game so you should get this game because it is fun
B0094POZE4|3|Note: I saw this film via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />The sequel to The Crow starring the late Brandon Lee was originally envisioned as a different film by writer David S. Goyer (who has since gone on to greater fame as the writer/co-screenwriter of BATMAN BEGINS & co-story writer of THE DARK KNIGHT, and now co-story writer/screenwriter of MAN OF STEEL) and director Tim Pope. I hope that the Director's Cut is released on DVD someday, so we can see what their vision for the film was, before Miramax decided to re-edit it in order to make it similar to the first movie.<br /><br />As released, though, The Crow: City Of Angels is a sub-par sequel. Worth seeing only once. Vincent Perez did a good job as Ashe (his French accent and sinistrous voice were perfect for this film) and Mia Kirshner was under-used as Sarah. I wish there had been more than just a brief passing reference to Eric and Shelly. Thuy Trang was also under-used as Kali. And what was the point of Sarah befriending the little girl if the girl was going to remain on the streets?<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the profaning of God'a Name (ie. combining the Name of God with a mild profanity).<br /><br />Rated R (strong violence, language, including several uses of a religious profanity, and some nudity).
B00UUFZE4C|5|It showed up fast and great quality thank you
B009ANP48G|5|Grandkids love it!
B004Y1WCDE|5|Absolutely fantastic.  Easy to use.  Great looking UI.  On more platforms than any of their competition.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B009XIXVU6|5|I think I liked his first two books better, but this one is another epic. Very interesting, and it flowed well. So it held me to the end.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is amazing every update it gets closer and closer to the Pc. I just wish the servers would work on 0.9.1
0062409859|2|I loved the grown-up scout (Jean Louise) .  Not at all comparable to &#34;To Kill a Mocking Bird&#34; but it was nevertheless a good read for me.  I did first reread &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; and it was everything I remembered it to be---wonderful!
B00BSBT8M6|5|A really good film.  I enjoyed it from the very start of the movie.  It deserved even more awards.  Simply an excellent movie.
B005KDWUFA|3|I have purchased two other Il Divo CDs and enjoyed them very much.  However, \\"Wicked Game\\" was not as enjoyable because at times the accompaniment seems to drown out the voices.
B00HZ3BGPS|5|Great!
1451635672|4|This  a thorough telling of the history of Tony Spilotro and Frank Rosenthal ( Nicky and Ace from the movie Casino).  Overall a very interesting introduction to this part of the Mafia in Las Vegas and the Chicago syndicate.  A little dry at times and would benefit From some narrative from more than just Frank Rosenthal.  But well worth reading.
B0040I09RM|5|I was feeling left out every time my husband was watching SOA. Then Charlie Hunnam was cast in Fifty Shades!  So, when I got my Fire, I decided to take advantage of my Prime & catch up. I am obsessed! The writing and characters captivate you. The acting/casting is perfection!
B000NGTJTY|5|Exciting movie
B008SAZHLQ|3|Great writing, interesting, surprisingly complex characters. (I especially enjoyed seeing park's parents' characters get fleshed out.) couldn't put it down for the last third.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I like the really good music and animation GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!😇
B00R7FZ074|5|Loved this movie. Great acting & historical story.
0743277708|5|It's been at least 20 years since I first read this book - and coming back to it after all that time has been just as enjoyable.<br /><br />What I appreciate more this time around is the lessons the book teaches on effective leadership and ethics of equality and representative politics. Those are two topics I never would have noticed reading this in my pre-teen years. We'll worth rediscovering.
B00BD99JMW|1|A terrible ending for such a wonderful story! I dont know why she did it. I just wish she hadnt.
B00881VLCE|1|not smooth, slow, difficult to move pieces.  Used to be my favorite game on my Kindle.  take it back to the previous version.
B007FKI9G0|5|Absolutely one of the funniest movies of all time. The first mockumentary may still be the best.  Rob Reiners directorial debut, but with Christopher Guest and gang, it really seems like a team effort.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Fun play with many options. The in game options are not excessive like some other apps. Good for kids or adults.
B00CWY76CC|5|I've tried other escape games, and this is the best one yet. I look forward to other levels, it passes the time when your just sitting at the doctors office or waiting on the wife to finish shopping. LOL.
1582701709|5|Gives some helpful advice and wise thoughts.
B00IVFC6QC|5|Was just right. Does all it promised.
B00BC24NT4|5|I have read a large number of novels, including John Le Carre novels.  This is one of the better ones.  The built up tension was almost excruciating.  Do I put the book down and wait for awhile to give myself a reprieve or do I press on to get relief by finding out what happens.  The book is very well written and very well organized.  Most novels have a hard time with the ending.  This ending just made me want more.  I think I know what the delicate truth was, but I will keep that to myself.  Very well done.
B00B2V66VS|5|love this game. and love the updates now its a whole lot better then the first temple run. I cant wait for temple run three to come out
B0032JTV6U|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Glee.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see this amazing show until the second season, so I purchased this set.  Now, I want every season on DVD so I can watch and rewatch!  Great from order to delivery!
B00J8CGU64|5|This movie was great in every way. Leo was great. Even Jonah Hill was good. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B003KT3NRA|5|I love the album and the book. I think that it is classic Vince with a twist. If you haven't heard it yet go out and get it.  You'll love it.
B00FWLDHSY|3|Great director laboring with a bad script (His own).  I watched this on a 17 hour train ride. Good way to break the tedium.
B000XUBFE2|5|As a teacher, I don't get a lot of time to read over the year. When the school year ended, I immediately sat down with this novel. It was phenomenal. The descriptions were fresh, the structure was innovative, and the only question I have is whether or not I can add it to my HS canon. Bravo, Zusak.
B00000G3Q4|5|this movie is amazing! I loved it the first time I saw it (several years ago)and am very proud to own the DVD. Any horror fan must add this to their collection. My only negative comment is that it isn't in Widescreen. It  always makes me wonder if I'm missing something that was &quot;cut&quot; to  make it fit my TV. Other than that, it was perfect. I already own Army Of  Darkness and am going to buy Evil Dead:2 very soon. Go buy this now!
B0014C0BMU|5|GREAT MOVIE ... is a classic... must be seen... and the info contained is very useful, if you understand it...
B00DR0PDNE|4|First of all  if you got the netflix deal, this thing could be considered free. Let ignore the cost of the doggle and look at the cost of the accesories that came with it. A hdmi extender, usb charger and usb cable would cost around ~11 or more if you buy it at Best Buy or any retails. The netflix deals last 3 months, which total to 8 x 3 = 24. All these things added together already make this thing worth it. However, the functionality of the actual chromecast is still pretty lacking. I tried connecting to my computer and due to bad wifi or something, I get very bad picture quality and youtube videos lack. I rather just connect my pc to a hdmi cable and extend my screen. BEWARE if you have bad wifi.
B00C7KXUOE|5|Beautiful sets, fantastic costumes, well developed and amazingly acted characters. Mads Mikklesen, and Hugh Dancy are stunning in their portrayals of Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter. The story lines arc over the season, not a formula cop show, which is refreshing. I truly can not say enough how much I love this series.
B00NAXE8V6|3|Not a bad deal. One of my fav Kiss Albums. Remastering is good. I just wish they had included more demos. Two Peter demos should have been included  such as the demo for Hooligan I have heard it from bootlegs and not a bad demo at all. The other Peter demo is Love Bites though not as good it was still offered up at the time for the sessions. Shame on Gene and Paul for never including Ace and Peter demos
B000066744|5|I happened on this movie one afternoon on the independent movie channel and was intrigued.  I ordered it to share with friends who have all enjoyed it as much as I.  I think this is one of the five best movies I have ever seen.  I am a professional piano player so this might have colored my judgement.  It was great.
B00JRKZM0C|5|Unlike a lot of their other re-releases, the two extra songs on this album are totally worth buying it again.  While I would have preferred to just purchase those songs by themselves, they were not made available that way.  So I figured &#34;Why not, I've bought half their other albums more than once for a couple extra songs each.&#34;  While I love this band, I wish they would reward their fans who buy their album right away, instead of punishing them with these unnecessary re-releases.  That aside, what a great album!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Love the writers style, easy to read and enjoyable even though a sad story.  Very quick read (three days) couldn't stop reading it.
B004W2UBYW|5|Background:<br />Both me and my sister simultaneously read the book. I am an electrical engineer and she is an administrator with little knowledge or interest in technology. She seemed to find the book equally interesting and was able to follow everything despite the occasional tech jargon.<br /><br />Review;<br />I thought Isaacson did an excellent job with capturing the life of Steve Jobs accurately while still making the book intriguing and making you want to read more. I guess the fact that Jobs was a real \\"character\\" in himself made this all the easier. The book appears very objective, Isaacson seems to try very hard to offer insight into all aspects of Job's life, regardless of the impression it leaves on the reader. Jobs is portrayed as rude and inconsiderate of others while being incredibly smart, intuitive, and calculating in his every move. Though Jobs does not come across as a typical role model, he still offers many insights into his success, learning from failures along the way. When discrepancies in the story arise between Jobs and another character in his life, Isaacson always presents both sides and lets the reader determine the truth with only a small commentary on his impression.<br /><br />Despite the harsh character of Jobs and the sad nature of the ending, the book is enjoyable to read. It is captivating and written in a way to keep some suspense despite the fact that many of the stories are well known and the endings can already be assumed. The book starts chronologically through Jobs life and the beginnings of Apple. Around the middle, it changes and each chapter becomes more of a segment of Jobs life focusing on one idea, business, event or personal conflict. These segments tend to have overlapping timelines but Isaacson uses dates, relationships, and key events to keep the reader aware of how the stories interact with each other. I found it easy to follow and the way the stories are told keeps you wanting to read more because you can't anticipate exactly what will follow with the slightly altered timeline.<br /><br />Personally, I read the book because I always thought Steve Jobs was an interesting Character. He seems to have somewhat of a magic touch with technology and I was just hoping to learn a little more about him and what shaped his life and ultimately led to his success (and failures). After reading the book, I have the impression that he really was a remarkable businessman and entrepreneur but his real genius was in spotting talented people and great ideas and then refining (both ideas and people) until they were perfect at any expense. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B00IG2DOKM|5|Love this game can't stop playing
B00BAXFECK|5|A beautifully written novel that is a gift to the reader. The depth of each character and their situations will remain with you long after the closing lines.
B0094BB4TW|1|Every time I download this app it makes my kindle freeze and act funny and move slow if I could rate this a 0 would.
B00IEBE7GK|5|This is such an amazing game!  The graphics are amazing and the storyline is very intriguing.  I recommend this game to everyone.  This is just as amazing as the first game.  I really hope that they come out with a third game.

B008XG1X18|5|Great place for new ideas and pins
B00BWBHIUG|5|This app is fun and addicting!  The graphics are wonderfully done and even the music is nice.  Very good app!
0062073486|4|Without giving away the ending, I venture forth. I had seen the black and white American version of this and it was called Ten Little Indians and if memory serves it ended differently. Having said that I did some digging to see why the name change, and well frankly with today's times, the name change was helpful and in some areas necessary as 10 little Indians is not the original title.<br /><br />Having said that, the book does keep you wondering who the killer is. If you are a mystery fan who likes waiting till the last page to have the mystery solved, then this is the book for you. I also enjoyed that fact that there were just people here, no high self centered or elderly detectives. This my friends is the first murder mystery party!
0385344430|5|Best Series ever!
B004U7JYXS|5|I love Instax mini color film. I like to get the white, then you can decorate however you would like.
B007J4T2G8|1|Too dirty for my taste
B004ZMWUCU|4|My first reaction was to question why the characters behaved as they did. As the author delved into what formed their habits and personalities, the &#34;why&#34; developed into empathy and gave rise to hope for them.
B003G4W49C|4|This is a well done science fiction war novel. Yes, the story focuses more on the main character's training rather than than the war they want him to eventually win for them, but that doesn't make it any less a war story.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this story is so popular and also why it's stood the test of time. Through Ender's point of view, the author manages to capture just the kind of torture the military establishment puts him through. Because it's mostly a mental torture, much of the narration works to that advantage. The quick snippets of conversation between people in charge of training him breaks of the story nicely, giving you insight into their way of thinking but then see the immediate effects of how it hurts, pushes, or helps Ender.<br /><br />Good well written story. This will undoubtedly maintain its classic status among science fiction novels.

It's a good read and the ending makes it worth the ride!  But, more important, the ending was thought-provoking - it made me stop and think about my life and the decisions I've made...
0062315005|5|Love the book.  Great read!
0399536108|5|I absolutely loved the book.  The recession has really caused me take a step back and figure out what I want in life.  I'm tired of possessions owning me.  I'm tire of my job owning me.  I want a different life than what I've had.  I want a 'quality' life that brings me happiness.  This book totally motivated me to go get that life.  His blog is great as well.  I bought ten copies of this book and gave them to my friends.
B00005B6N7|1|U571 is perhaps the most absurd war film I have ever seen. Nothing about this film is believable. IT starts out with the absurd proposition that a German sub captain and crew stood by while approached by the crew of an American sub posing as another German crew. The Germans would have made radio or semaphore contact- not to mention the fact that the Germans could see the American sub and did not notice that it was American, not German. OK, it was raining, but then another German sub comes along, sees the two subs, recognizes which one is American, and torpedoes it. Apparently the other Germans were better at sub recognition.<br />Then a few Americans on the captured German sub take a 4 second lesson in German sub operation and proceed to destroy the other German sub- amazing! They encounter a German plane over the Atlantic. One of the American seamen orders another to shoot it down AGIANST THE ORDERS OF AN OFFICER WHO IS STANDING RIGHT THERE. The officer does nothing to this seaman. On Das Boot, the Captain almost shoots a crewman who panics. Who could believe US officers to be so easy going?<br />The American controlled sub approaches a German surface vessel, where the plane comes from. Once again, the Germans don't bother with radio or semaphore contact. The American man their deck gun while the Germans sit idly by, and get their radio shot out. Apparently German warships only had 1 radio during WW2, because now they cannot tell that one of their subs has been captured. If that is not all idiotic enough, remember that this has to be some time in 1943- what is a German cruiser doing out in the Atlantic in broad daylight that late in the war?<br />A German prisoner overpowers one of the Americans on 571 and gets his 45. Another superhuman American charges him, gets shot, but keeps on going and gets the German. Isn't it funny how Germans drop when shot but Americans keep right on going? Earlier in the film, when the Americans board U571, most of the Germans hide in the engine room and cower when the Americans enter. Fact is that the German U Boat crews were chosen for their nerve. Theirs was the most elite service in German military of WW2, but in this movie they are mostly spineless cowards.<br />I did not see the rest of this film, because it was just getting too stupid to be entertaining. One might point out that this in not a historical documentary, its supposed to be entertaining, but how can something so blatantly idiotic be entertaining? This film is worse than Holywood propaganda films during the war. Not only does it portray the enemy as incompetent idiots or cowards and the Americans as superheroes, it has numerous historical inaccuracies. War films do not have to be 100% accurate, but they cannot be completely unbelievable and still be entertaining. This film should have been made as a spoof or not at all. As a serious film it is pathetic and a waste of time. I want the producers to pay me for the time I wasted watching their idiotic garbage.the engine room and cower when the Americans enter.

B004LWZW4M|4|Frequently sequels or imitations or take-offs or whatever the designator you choose of famous older movies prove to be ho-hum to poor. If that is the thought about RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES then give this film a chance. It has a lot of nuances we don't expect from movies of this genre - introducing the concept of genetic therapy, for example - in addition to the fact that it has a superb cast on both extremes of the animal spectrum!<br /><br />The principal player is Caesar (beautifully enacted by Andy Serkis at the later age and by Terry Notary in the early phase), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from the experimental drug ALZ 112, a drug that causes neurogenesis, which allows the brain to grow new brain cells (something that doesn't happen after birth) and heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to the eyes. Raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco in a very fine, sensitive role) and a primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned in an ape sanctuary in San Bruno. Seeking justice for his fellow inmates, Caesar gives the fellow apes the same drug that he inherited. He then assembles a simian army and escapes the sanctuary - putting man and ape on a collision course with dire possibilities.<br /><br />Blended into this story are some fine subplots and the presence of such excellent actors as John Lithgow, Brian Cox, David Oyelowo among others. The screenplay was written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver whose ideas came form the Pierre Boulle novel,  `La plan&egrave;te des singes'. The direction is in the sure hands of Rupert Wyatt and of course considerable credit is due to the special effects and costume/makeup crew.  This is a fine summer evening's entertainment!

B003U0I9TQ|5|...a band that quotes Shakespeare and writes music based on Steinbeck novels?  But more than they appeal to the intellect, it is the rawness of emotion that keeps me hitting the \\"replay\\" button.  The lead singer has this edge to his voice, and he is well backed by the instrumentals as the songs become more frenzied. There isn't a bad song on this album, although there are some  I hit listen to more often than others.    The lyrics evoke powerful images, and straddle the line between love songs and religious transcendence.  There have been very few rock bands over the years that have intrigued and excited me to the level that this band has.  The only problem?  I want more!  More songs, more albums...  I've found a few songs on Youtube that don't seem to be available on CD or even MP3 (Like \\"Liar\\")and I want them! The funny thing is, I was never a fan of the banjo until I heard \\"Little Lion Man\\" on the radio late one night when I was driving home.      If you're on the fence, just buy the album.  It's worth every penny, and then some.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This app is awesome, it makes you not want to stop guessing what it is. Also this app is good if you take adventures and like mysteries. Hope you enjoy the app as much as I do!
0553106635|5|Wow, I don't know what can be said that could do this book, or this series justice.  I can say this is the best fantasy series ever written, and this is the best book within the series.  I strongly recommend A Song of Ice and Fire. The book to start with is A Game of Thrones.  Once you read that there is no doubt in my mind you'll pick up the rest of the books.  Enjoy
B00006JSS8|4|A very comprehensive list of his best songs ranging from his beginnings to his latest.  I highly recommend adding it to your library, especially if you don't have any dedicated albums of his yet.  It ranges from the beginnings to the latest and is a great album.<br /><br />However, apparently, if you're a major heavy duty audiophile and Wonder affectionado, there are sound, choice and mixing irritations.<br /><br />For me, though, this album is wonderful and has all the memories and enjoyment one could ask for!
B00L9B7IKE|4|The author is great at keeping one in suspense.  I liked the fact it took place in Norfolk England.  The reader could empathize with all three women, who were complex characters
B00H58VGIA|5|Inspiring and an amazing story
B0054YHB8Q|5|The music on this one is great and are timeless classics.  I’ve been listening to this album since it first came out, and now my high schooler and associated friends love listening to it, also (or they are humoring me by asking me to play it).<br /><br />One thing to point out on this CD version – strangely, it is not available in MP3 format here on Amazon (maybe Tom is suing them, too) – while not in the product description the CD insert says it is a remastered version.  I’m not too sure as to what was remastered, as for someone like me who has this album memorized I couldn’t tell a difference in anything except a little less treble on some the songs.<br /><br />If you’re looking to replace your lost or damaged Boston album, or you are someone who is just now discovering Boston and enjoy timeless rock, I would recommend you get not only this album but Boston’s self-titled debut album.
B008ROVTEW|5|Great
B001QOOCTE|4|The CD & DVD Playing for Change is one of the Best. The people that sing and play in the CD and DVD are Very Talented. They also have a great love of music. These talented people are showing that music is but one language. This My Friends is Kick Ass!!!!!

It will do this just until I give up and stay off Facebook for a few days .. can something please be done for that.
0307387178|5|I saw the movie first and just knew I had to read the book. I still have mixed feelings about this guy. I envy his nerve but he was too smart to have been so ill-prepared. Maybe he was a little arrogant and spoiled. I also question why he seemingly wasn't fishing more. I recommend this book, but I am always drawn to non-fiction. I like the way the author adds his own experiences as well as those of other similar characters. It's a very good read.
B000I8ES2A|5|That's a tall statement to say that this smaller lower budget movie is better than the Matrix.  They're very different movies.  The Matrix is an action movie where this is more of a mystery drama.<br /><br />To be fair, this movie was more like GATTACA than the matrix in terms of speed.  It's an interesting exploration into virtual reality worlds.  Definitely consider getting this movie and watching it.  It challenges you to think about the limits of our humanity.<br /><br />This is a first rate movie with excellent actors and a very tightly woven plot.  It does have a few twists and turns which is nice in a movie like this.  In the end, it turns out to have a wonderful surreal dreamlike quality to it that is mesmerizing.  I highly recommend it with a glass of wine.<br /><br />If you're looking for heavy duty action - go for the Matrix<br />If you're looking for a surreal ride with great actors, solid acting, and great filming - go for this.
B00006SFLV|5|This show is real. Forget Dawson's Creek, no one talks like that. Forget anything else you've ever watched. This is what it's really like to be a teenager. If you've forgotten... it sucks. But you survived, didn't you? This series will remind you how. And maybe scare you a bit if you have kids of your own.<br />The acting and script-writing in this series is mind-blowing. If you've never seen it, you've missed out. Technical issues like poor sound quality, and the occasional episode with slightly ropey colour, would mar it a little were it not for the fact that these are the best five DVDs on the planet. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />What are you waiting for? Buy it now.

B00005BL2A|3|I bought this the day it was released and held off on the review until I had ample time to listen.  Having said that, it isn't my favorite Depeche Mode for sure.  I, like many others, hold high expectations from this cutting edge group.  Therefore, anything less than perfect, I suppose is a bit of a let down.  It isn't really the pace that's the problem.  I have always enjoyed their slower tracks.  The infusion of more guitar, that's fine. Something, maybe in the delivery wasn't emotional enough for me, yet rather forced at times.  There are moments though, I liked &quot;Shine,&quot; which is about as old school DM as it gets here, with a catchy bridge and chorus.  Also &quot;Freelove&quot; is good, with a smooth melody and groove.  I like &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; with its industrial beat and distorted guitar riffs, which will probably either be loved or hated.  &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; is quite pretty but I think would've been better minus the low bass or drum track that plagues it...The so-so tracks are the snappy &quot;Dream On,&quot; with the half sung half spoken lyrics and sparse synths, the house style of &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; (a little played), &quot;I Am You,&quot; is fair with a floating reggae-eque bass line and the closer &quot;GoodNight Lovers&quot; is again, not bad.  Usually, Martin Gore's contributions are my favorite, here, the opposite.  I didn't care for &quot;Comatose&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; is bad.  On a more positive note, the production overall is good, the lyrics are honest and introspective, and the inside CD sleeve is glossy and slick.  Exciter could've been worse, then again, it could've been better!
B00271B752|5|Loved this movie years ago and decided to see it again.  Al Pacino is the best and deserves accolades for being the most talented actor around then and now.
B0001Z52RU|5|I went into Butterfly Effect with only one expectation: to see Ashton Kutcher in a serious role. After seeing him on &quot;That 70's Show,&quot; &quot;Punk'D&quot; and the deliciously stupid &quot;Dude Where's My Car?&quot; I was ready to see what the serious side of him could bring to the table. What I got with this film is more than I had bargained for. Sure, the previews promised a lot (and delivered on it), but this film is one of the most intense and gripping movies I have seen in a long time. First time directors  J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress do an outstanding job with the material, and although the initial premise is far-fetched, it's forgiven because of how the story sucks you in and makes you feel involved. Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student with a dark past, who can't remember key moments in his life because he simply blacked them out. He is told his dad is crazy, and as a child, sees him die. Evan's doctor told him to start writing journals when he was seven years old and when he reads a passage in the present day about a moment that he blacked out, he finds himself in a dream-like state where he is reliving the moment he couldn't remember. After a few experiences, Evan figures he can control these dreams and try to change things and maybe create a better future for him and his three childhood friends: Tommy (William Lee Scott), Lenny (Elden Henson) and most importantly, the girl he has loved since as long as he can remember (Tommy's twin sister) Kayleigh (Amy Smart). However, everytime Evan goes back in time, things in the present get shifted around severely, and most of the time, end up the worst. Evan finds himself going from frathouse to prison to wheelchair and each time he experiments, his window of hope for saving his friends seems to be waning. The most powerful scenes involve Evan's childhood, where we slowly watch how deranged Tommy can get, how disturbed Lenny can get, and how messed up Kayleigh's life can get. All of the actors in this film turn out exceptional performances. Obviously Kutcher does a great job, and is natural as Evan. But props must go to the underrated Amy Smart, who plays so many different characters in this movie and covers so much area. You can tell she put a lot into the role and it translates onto the screen. The movie (well, the theatrical cut) revolves around the love-story between Evan and Kayleigh, and basically serves as Evan's motivation. This movie is a bit disturbing, if you have certain childhood scars that you would rather not bring up, I wouldn't recommend this movie. But the bottom-line is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is a great movie and exceeds all expectations. The Director's Cut found on this DVD, is basically the original movie, with some cut-scenes pasted here and there (and it's easy to see why some of these were cut) and a completely different ending. Personally, I liked the original ending better. It just seems to end perfectly, exactly the way it should. But The Director's Cut, while being risky and bold, just doesn't seem to fit. But, it's all open for interpretation. The extras are somewhat disappointing. The extra deleted scenes are always nice and the commentary from the directors is rather interesting, but there isn't much else going on.n this film turn out exceptional performances.

0316017922|4|We all know that being in the right place at the right time has a lot to do with success.  Malcolm Gladwell gives us lots of examples, the first of which is about being born in the right month if you aspire to professional hockey in Canada.  He also stresses the importance of ambition, hard work, and the influences that shape our lives.  The most disturbing section has to do with cultural influences and the devastating airline tragedies that occurred partly because of a co-pilot who was overly deferential to the captain and to air traffic controllers.  The author often reminds us that it's not necessary to be exceedingly smart to be successful; it's just necessary to be smart enough.  He gives the example of a man whose IQ is in the 190s but didn't finish college because of his inability to negotiate a class schedule that would allow him to continue.  In contrast, another man attempted to murder a professor and still went on to become immensely successful.  Near the end, he takes a linguistic approach to explaining one of the reasons Asians excel at math.  I had never really considered how the English language makes arithmetic more difficult than it needs to be.  He also presents a strong case for year-round school.
B00GX59QO2|4|I just love action!
0316666343|5|Once I started I couldn't stop reading this book.  This is a totally different perspective in that it tells the story through the eyes of  the victim of a brutal murder.  The writing was outstanding in that you can visualize the places and people along with her perspective of what \\"heaven\\" is.  You will laugh and cry as you see what happens to the lives of Susie's family along with her experinces past and present.  I am looking forward to reading more of Alice Sebold's works she is a gifted writer.

B001H5X7I4|4|You'll laugh but this movie isn't for the easily offended. Heck, even a few hard-to-offend viewers will cringe, too. A comedy hasn't had this much in-your-face political incorrectness since [[ASIN:B0001Z4OXS Blazing Saddles]].<br /><br />You'll be worn out by the end of this two-hour movie but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The hardest laughs come all too quickly before the film settles down to a slower pace.<br /><br />The story follows a group of high-maintenance actors on the set of a Vietnam war movie that is spinning out of control and likely to become the all-time box office flop, pushing aside [[ASIN:B000NQRR1G Cutthroat Island]], [[ASIN:B00003CXWS The Adventures of Pluto Nash]] and [[ASIN:B000FS9UK8 Basic Instinct 2]].<br /><br />Ben Stiller has the most screen time but Robert Downey Jr. steals the scenes as an Australian method actor who manages to eclipse Robert De Niro's famed transformation in [[ASIN:B00062IVKS Raging Bull]].<br /><br />Jack Black (in a nod to Eddie Murphy's [[ASIN:0783225539 The Nutty Professor]]), Brandon T. Jackson, Jay Baruchel round out the rest of the main acting troupe. In smaller roles, Nick Nolte portrays the author of the book, Tropic Thunder, which \\"got\\" the movie deal (there's an in-joke). Matthew McConaughey appears as Stiller's TiVo-crazed agent and Tom Cruise appears nearly unrecognizable in creepy make-up as the film's producer. Not a single actor displays anything approaching subtlety or sanity.<br /><br />One final warning: skip the DVD extras at your own risk. The viral video for MTV is hilarious.

B006LSZECO|5|AMAZING!!! Every chapter is an OMG moment. Would recommend this book, and have to many people. Enjoyed every minute of it
0307010856|4|This is a really sweet storybook I remember from my childhood. Similar concept to Monsters, Inc. movie - teaches children not to be afraid of monsters. Helps with the 'afraid of the dark' phase. Only thing is it's a small Goldenbook. I thought it would be a bigger size. Spend a couple dollars more and buy the big version.
B00BD99JMW|5|I really liked all three of the books. I only saw the first movie and after reading the book my opinion is: read the books, don't even bother with the movies. I will probably see the second movie when it's available on Amazon Prime, but the third one, Allegiant, is the one I really want to see. I want to see how they are going to reconcile one glaring discrepancy between the first book (Divergent) and the movie of the same name that is consistent in all three books but is a contradiction between the movie Divergent and the book, Allegiant. But the books, all three, are wonderful and unique.

Glad to have a full CD of his material and especially since some of the songs have been re-recorded vs. previously releases.  Great variety and lyrics that leave you wondering at times \\"did I hear that right\\"?.  Looking forward to seeing him live at the Fox Theater later this month.
B009NFHF0Q|4|Great read (:

B00HY7VU60|5|Loved this series. I decided to watch them in two days and was I pleasantly surprised. Talk about some cut throats. You never knew who to trust. The queen was pretty decent and loved the king, so why didn't anyone see that? Jealousy...pure and simple. I don't know how anyone would want to be royalty...it seems like a lot of incest and inbreeding-No wonder they were all crazy! Looking forward to the next season!
B008XX6J4C|5|I've been so impressed with what I've seen come out of the Piano Guys!  They are such talented musicians!  The music on this disc has been very uplifting and fun.  I aspire to be that great a the piano one day.  Everything down to the solo by Alex Boye in Peponi, just a really well done selection of music. 5 stars, 5 stars, 5 STARS!!!
