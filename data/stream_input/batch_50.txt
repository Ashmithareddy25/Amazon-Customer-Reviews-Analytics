B00GSAUHB8|5|Works perfect! I always had a problem with my car feeling so hot when getting out of work and this car shields does help to protect it from the heat. Do recommend and such a great price.
B00684TAYY|5|Excelente
B00EECL90U|1|One bulb went out after 2 months, it gonna take me another 2 hours to change the bulbs..<br />Well...I bought this because it was given high rating but I am still disappointed.
B007WISFC8|5|Perfect. Lay down nice on my window
B000UXV9VG|5|Fits amazingly well on the C Class!  Much better than the one size fits all
B008EWPHZE|5|Great buy
B00DLMGJWW|5|I bought a similar set years ago. I paid almost $500.00 for them, and these are almost the same quality.  I highly recommend these to anyone want to upgrade your lighting system.
B005DN5L4O|5|Working great
B00PWJ2RM8|5|Fits really good, just for parking sensors is hard because a need to take off two of them.
B004A58LUM|5|For the price that I paid for this brake hose totally exceed my expectation. The fitment and quality built so far very good as I've driven my car for 3000 miles with this brake hose trouble free.
B001D9DP0E|4|Good quality and shipping. Came as descripited.
B007EA6R0Q|5|Very rugged!
B00EA2DMJK|5|This 24&#34; length definitely improved my reception over the 13&#34; version. I was looking for an antenna that had just the right look to it when I purchased the 13&#34; but I sacrificed some reception. I bought this slightly longer one and the reception is much better without sacrificing the look. In fact, it looks better than the 13&#34; one and certainly better than the original stock one that came with my Wrangler.
B000HEBR3I|5|It world's great. Wish I would have got this sooner.
B00YTZ9EEK|4|While some of the hardware is cheap and easily overtorqued I love the kit. I just need to get aftermarket stuff for it now... muahahahaha!
B008GT1J2K|5|Came on time and as advertised.
B00G69EKV4|5|Works great
B00IX5MRD2|3|I bought this for my 2011 Audi Q5. To figure out how to fit this light was not easy (I tried watching some videos for help) and another issue i have is that there is no instructions on how to change the filter with the package. Mine came installed with USA Flag logo and i realized this after installing the lights. I had to remove the light and reinstall it bcos of this. Also oen of my light is upside down (displaying upside down when projected on the floor). But the light is bright and at night(when it is really dark), you will be able to see the logo clearly. Gave this 3 stars because :<br />1) one light is upside down<br />2) not enough instruction with the package
B003Y323NC|5|Excellent setup for keeping a close eye on your engine, I added the egt probe<br />Money well spent would definitely recommend this product
B000RFGYBW|5|One of my favorite shop items. Awesome.
B00BR035VS|5|Great product great price
B0076D5OI2|5|Perfect fit. Had to do no mods.  ( plug and play )
B008506T20|4|This resolved a continuing aggravation for me, trying to latch the seat belt at the same level as the seat.
B00A6X07I6|5|Hope it fit well for my 2015
B005FKTWOK|4|So far so good
B000C9GJFO|5|Very good
B00XULVDHK|5|Great product! They adhere perfectly to the window, and they are so easy to take on and off as needed. I use them on the front side windows to keep the sun from beating on my arms, and they keep me nice and cool. Even though they block the sunlight, they are still very easy to see through. I definitely recommend these shades!
B008XN7NUG|2|ABS reset options are very limited
B001GPX41K|5|Quick delivery and very satisfied
B000CIXMIC|1|Very poor quality! all gaskets on it leak and the screw/bolt receivers usually break. Definitely recommend spending a little more cash on a aluminum one.
B00042KG3A|5|We have it mounted on our 09 wrangler and it's great!
B00JA396BC|5|I purchases the 24&#34; and 19&#34; PIAA Aero Vogue Silicon wipers for my mom's 2005 Camry. It has been using Bosch Icon wipers for the past 3 years and have worked well, but a recent storm cracked the windshield and had to be replaced. When that was done, I installed the new PIAA wipers. They do an amazing job since they are made from silicon. It cleans the water off, does not streak or chatter, and there is no noise. It was a toss up between the Aero Vogue and the Si-Tech, but the Aero Vogue is still made in Japan while the Si-Tech is now being made in Vietnam (lower quality).<br /><br />On a side note, I did try PIAA wipers on my 2009 Altima. The Aero Vogue 26 or 28&#34; on the drivers side and 17&#34; on the passenger side, but due to the curvature of the glass, several inches of the blade do not even touch the glass. I then tried the Si-Tech 26&#34; and 17&#34; on the Altima, and they do it and make full contact with the glass. But when used at high wiper speed, part of the wiper place arm is turning under and makes a loud squeaking noise. So I ended up buying a new pair of Bosch Icons for the Altima.
B000C3ZDR0|5|Very heavy and very stiff shocks-noticeable improvement in ride & handling after install. Mix-up on shipping was handled instantly and actually shortened shipping time! Great vendor!
B000HUQACU|5|Worked great. Ordered these because they are metal and not plastic like so many others today.
B0049MHU9Y|5|Good
B003CWYXVK|5|this is my 2nd coverking cover for this car - the first one was a lower grade and basically dissolved / tore in the sun, hoping this one holds up, it cost double the other one - keeps car cool in sun and clean
B000W0PMUG|5|Great lock for the price!  The chain is super strong and looking at it I feel it is &#34;intimidating&#34; to anyone wanting to steal my motorcycle.  I lock it to an eye bolt anchor I have in concrete and I feel it is very well protected.  Will it stop everyone, probably not but the majority will look elsewhere.  The description said it came with 1 lighted key but mine came with 2 and they both work.  Pretty cool!
B000AA4RWM|5|Nice product, easy install, useful for adjusting tow rigs.
B000C40RV6|5|As with the shocks, these are very heavy duty and rugged struts, at the best price around.
B0049CK6W2|3|Plugged in tester first time and both left and right LEDs flashed when either blinker was used.  After some checking of wires, I found that the tester showed my harness worked correctly (each blinker flashed independently) if I did not push the tester completely into the harness.  I haven't yet tested it on a trailer but assume it will operate correctly.
B0001MQ7EK|4|We like this cooler. The only trouble we had was getting the packaging off when it arrived. The way it was wrapped around the lid made it very challenging. We also noticed that part of the handle where it locks was bent. We found that leaving the handle in locked position for a while helped it mold back to it's correct position. All in all, a handy cooler for sure.
B000RGPZ02|5|Listing indicates it's for up to, and including, model year 2000.  I have a 2001 (last year the Cherokee produced) and this product fits fine.  About a 10 minute install.
B00M9MYV5M|1|the flow is very small, spend 10 min to cover a quarter size chip .
B000FOL0AA|2|did not work.
B00Z09Q334|5|A very chic complement to my Cadenza
B00192JGDU|5|Great damp table. Very sturdy when set up. Lots of areas to put kitchen items.  Did not have it out in the rain but will seal the wood shelves as others have stated.
B00D3298A0|1|Too small
B000C17GM2|3|Dorman is hit or miss.  Most of their stuff works ok as cheap OE replacement, but you get what you pay for as far as quality.  On this particular item, 620-800, I got 2 bad brand new ones (1 from ebay, and 1 from amazon) before the 3rd one worked.  Same problem on both, Fan was tight and motor smoked once it stopped spinning.  I think a bad batch got through Dorman's Quality control department.  I was patient (and trying to be cheap!!) so I got Amazon to send me another one.  It finally worked.  Obviously price point is what drove me to choose Dorman and to be patient with their horrible quality control.  I paid $70.xx for this one vs $200.00+ for oe.  Like I said 3rd one worked, but he plastic is a little cheap and somewhat flimsy.  Just be careful installing it as it will break.  I put this on my personal car.<br />About me:  16 year ASE Master Technician,  Ph.D. Mechanical Engineer,  etc....
B00EEMJBYQ|5|Cute item, delivered fast
B00BITHROY|5|Oem fit,
B00144EIBI|5|These are great speakers, easy installation and awesome sound.
B0028ZKMM6|5|Bought this to use with my stebel nautilus. This unit is plug and play, but there may be some cutting and crimping required if you don't want a whole lot of extra wire. Overall I'm happy with this product and would order it again.
B00KTL2AJ4|5|Great part and brand new
B000EFXJ6S|1|Bought it to get info on the 2005 Cummins charging system.  It was no help at all.  It gave no pertinent info and referred me to the dealer for repair.  It was of no use to me.
B00H3IU26E|5|Love it!!!!!
B00HAQBEH0|5|Really like these, decent magnet and perfect for hands free when working on a panel.
B002MWNT84|5|Offers good protection
B00GK6WWFO|5|I got this for my younger brother and he loves it! Great gift for the baseball fanatic in your life.
B00R1EMWJ0|5|Very good starter
B00EE23VA6|5|Works great with the stock board from an '05 Dodge Dakota.
B001FNG7BM|4|all new starter at a great price, has a little bit of a high pitched whining noise, but it's been working well... dunno what's going to happen... we'll see, but it's working fine now..  very shiny, all new starter with lifetime warranty for half the price of motorcraft  ....  great deal
B000UK65IG|5|These make loading and unloading a sled super simple. I used to have to screw in the old tie downs on my friends trailer, but with the screw part staying in, and being able to drive over them without causing any damage to the sled, it now takes mere seconds to tie down the sled instead of minutes. Also like I can lock these, and not have to worry about tie down straps as well to hold the back down. Got the matching superclamp for the front. Installation took less than an in my brothers enclosed trailer to add a set of these with a backer plate.
B0023VKUJ0|5|Excellent part, fits perfect, thank you.
B00CLBTHJ6|5|I was very happy with this it wasnt cheap looking or anything. Very happy
B00029WYEY|5|I had my K&N filter installed at least 18-20 months in my Subaru. I figured that might have been more than enough time to keep it in.  The typical paper filter lasted me 8-12 months.  So I order this  K&N recharging kit and set out to perform some routine maintenance.<br /><br />To my surprise, the K&N filter did not look so bad.  I banged the filter along the side of my garage wall to shake out some fragments of fall leaves from last year.  I closed and locked the garage door and took the filter into the house with me.  I sprayed the filter thoroughly with the K&N cleaning agent and then I took a ordinary plastic grocery bag and place the filter inside and closed it air tight so the cleaning agent wouldn't dry out prematurely.  I did a few other things around the house.  Forty minutes later I removed it from the bag and ran tap water from the clean side out to the dirty side.  After I cleaned it, it looked brand new.  I wasn't going to drive the car that afternoon so I left the filter to dry overnight.<br /><br />The next morning I sprayed the K&N aerosol oil on both sides of the filter.  The oil has a pinkish color which helps to determine which parts of the filters have been coated.  I let the oil soak in for a few hours and took a old but clean dry towel and tapped it against the filter to soak up any extra oil to eliminate the possibility of some of it coming off and coating the air sensor.  Easy peasy, worked well.  I probably won't clean it again until another 24 or 36 months because it really didn't look so bad after 18 months.  Of course everyone's  YMMV.  I live in Connecticut so the filter wasn't bad at all.  Thumbs up for K&N!
B000CMDCZ6|5|excellent fit and finish.
B000CGV7UE|5|Quality brakes for my MB w211!
B000B8N3FU|5|Exactly what I needed.  Stant makes best locking fuel caps I have ever used and I have tried other brands.
B00W7724P8|3|I used this product for a week and after it get broken. It is not good product. Sorry! but that is my experience.
B009WKWSMC|5|just what we needed  good price an fast shipping
B00UMQ5P8O|1|Cheap, outside gas cap spins around freely and there's a gap between jeep and cap
B00HZOBP62|3|It's what we needed.  I bought it would feel softer and more rubbery...but no.  Little concerned about slipping on the hard plastic, but it certainly covers the surfaces adequately.  For the money, I would have wanted something more pliable and slip resistant.
B00EKN2P60|5|Awesome color and brightness one year later
B001G4Z5J0|4|The carrier came in in the time it said it would.  It was easy to put together and works great on our 2014 Ford Edge.
B005O25D38|5|A smooth, sleek alternative to bulkier looking vent shades. Easy to install, and factory appearance. Directions could be slightly clearer, but this a great product to help keep your car interior cooler when sitting in a sun-baked parking lot.
B00CMV9HDG|1|The part was incomplete/missing the receiver where the door cables attach. (Labeled as part 6 or 11 in the diagram).
B00HRSPUCQ|4|Despite that the part and its fit is very tight and I had some difficult for installation, the delivery was on time and the part was the correct one. After fighting a little, went in and now is working as expected. Good experience so far.
B00CMP3Z4E|5|Jumped my buddy's car four or five times within a couple weeks with this. No problems.
B0016LG0CY|1|Piece of crap product. Never worked straight out of the package. Instead it blew the fuses in my car so now my outlets don't work. I read reviews and changed fused even though it never blew and still didn't work. I do not recommend this product at all.
B00CPYC98K|5|Great ebayer fast delivery product properly packed and fits description.
B0009XQUKW|4|Works fine, good length was able to crawl under pickup and try and start the engine.  The clips are a little too well protected had to slide the cover back in order to clip onto the terminals and contact points.
B005A573ZU|5|Exactly what I needed. Fast shipping
B008CE0R40|5|does its job
B010OYOHO6|3|Good design for the price. A little heavy at first, but I got use to it very quickly. Sound quality was very good, once again, for the price. The original headset lasted for exactly one run and one-half of a bicycle ride; nothing but static afterwards. However, the Apollo customer service department was as responsive and customer focused as could be imagined. A replacement headset was provided within two days. That kind of determination to provide customer satisfaction is worth four stars alone. If the replacement headset lasts for a month of jogging and bicycling, I will raise my rating to five stars.  UPDATE - The replacement headset lasted for one-half of a jog, then, once again, nothing but static. This product has been a waste of time.  SECOND UPDATE: Before throwing away, I tried using the headset one last time. After reseating the micro chip I then secured the rubber cover to the USB port and micro chip access well. I then turned the device on. It emitted nothing but static for about 10-15 seconds - then music. Perhaps the headset went through some type of booting process. In any event, after securing the rubber cover with a plastic twist tie, the headset worked as advertised. I have used in for one three hour bike ride, throughout which it worked. The headset fits very well, it was comfortable to wear and its sound quality is exceptionally good. However, despite the excellent customer service provided by the vendor, it has taken far too much effort to get to this point.
B0024E2POE|3|Just Penney nails rusted in one week
B004QEF970|5|Fits great since I have a Curt trailer hitch.
B00K3XW4TO|4|long scratched line on the right side of the lip but hey this is the cheapest lip on the market and it makes the car look good
B004QEKG8C|4|nice light carrier, bonus that it folds up.
B0001MII88|5|hose seems to be very well made,pliable and not stiff. seems kink resistant as advertised.....David A.
B00Y07TZ3C|1|Horrible. Don't waste your time. No instructions, just a lame diagram.  I returned them
B0041U61HG|5|What's not to love!!!
B001IN5KUI|5|Good
B005FG28K4|4|Great light down side only 3 flash patterns
B004X5QNYA|4|The radiator was almost an exact match for my 2002 Jeep Wrangler, and it was very good quality. The transmission oil connections were not the same, but it came with the right ones. The two issue. It did not come with a radiator cap which I had to replace and the existing fan shroud screws would not work with the new radiator. The holes were too large. I had to purchase four bolts and nuts to attach my fan shroud to the radiator. Not a big deal, but I wanted future buys to know
B00JQI9LPW|5|Very well built, works as expected. I'd like to have seen a baffle inside but it wasn't advertised as such and was easy to add.
B00FLSG6V8|4|Sturdy. Great style. Shipping great. Packaging great. Rear mats way too small for the space in my truck.
B00EB30YHQ|3|This is ok, the reason I can't give it more stars is that it sags reallty bad in the middle, I have to prop something against the bottom in the middle to keep it against the window.  The size is right, it's just a huge front window on the 2014 Escape, it needs to be a little thicker to stay up there right.
B00PT18QAQ|5|excellent pressure gauge, just as described.
B00AO6HOAY|5|EXCELLENT
B000CMDA1C|5|Ordered these when I got new rims to match the new chrome. Worked great and I love the locking feature as an extra protection.
B00ODCT4W6|5|It works
B005OK402K|1|It's very flimsy and flaps off the back of the seat because the Velcro strap that's goes around the chair is not short/strong enough. The bottom half broke the first time I put items in it.
B00BG0QUAW|5|This lanyard is great.  The ribbon is silky soft and about an inch thick.  I chose the black one with pink ribbon because the dirt won't be as noticeable as it would be with the white ribbon.  Length is great, my ID hangs slightly higher than my belly button. The metal clip at the end freely rotates around. Would purchase again if necessary.
B00EC0YSC0|1|waste of money.
B0040CRWMS|1|Not very strong I can easily bend them in my hand.
B001GJ3EJS|5|very nice for detailing car
B003BHE3QQ|5|All fine
B00YHNL8L6|5|Awesome.
B0085KGOH0|4|We bought this because where we were going camping didn't have full hook ups. All I can say is, this is the best invention ever. Between 2 camper trailers, both at about 2/3rds full, we were able to fill up the tote and dump at the parks dump station.
B00S8A0932|5|This worked great in my Lexus IS250. I love the extra storage and they look like they were always there.
B000WEOQD6|5|I bought this wheel cover as gift to my cousin. He put this one his wheel as a protection and he loved it so much which still using it up till now.<br />This is my first buying car accessories on Amazon, and it doesn't disappointed me after all.
B000T2W336|5|Perfect Fit - Replaces my really old worn World Straps, yaaa
B00F7GXNX8|5|love it
B004WWUBCO|5|Love it! Put it on the back of my orange Jeep. No mistaking a redhead droves it now.
B00TEC8GGK|5|they look great in my 2013 frontier but not able to use the back because it is a king cab but will save it
B00COYNWP0|2|Material is SO cheap, big holes ripped at the seams within he first week. Would not recommend.
B000C5G43A|5|Perfect fit helps clean up the old interior.
B00K8SEOYC|4|Worked Great.
B004N0IZNC|5|Product is incredible. Must be used with Major Shine.
B00651CBO6|5|Love it! I actually pick up channels better too!
B00AMT37V8|1|it is not sturdy enough to hold heavy item.
B009DJWNTK|5|Great replacement taillight. Looks better than stock actually. Great price too. Will buy again if I have to get another one. Quality is great. Shipping was fast and item was packed securely. Thank you.
B00E1WS3DY|5|Love it.  As a Jurassic Park fan it's a nice item to have for the collection.
B001VLK0RA|4|A little slow on the pumping, but works ok.
B00J594B5C|5|Bought this for my 2004 Toyota Corolla. It was rusting very badly in front of the rear passenger tire. An automotive collision shop recommended this. I bought the kit because I did not have all the products handy (meaning de-greaser, latex gloves). The kit is very complete. If you already have the listed items, then maybe all you need is the POR-15.<br /><br />This stuff went on very smoothly. It's been a month and I still can't see the rust holes.
B004DRXWEC|5|Good!
B00GD8CMDQ|2|I had the same oil leak problem as several have also mentioned. My kit included a flat copper washer and not a crush washer.  Had to buy proper washer from MINI which promptly stopped the leak. Appears to be a nice filter and I have used this part number before with no problems.  Not sure why KN apparently changed the washer.  Very disappointing and annoying.  Back to OEM kit for me.
B00CZ4VFOE|5|I finally had a chance to use my UCLEAR HBC100 Plus communication equipment and am very satisfied.  I bought it so that my partner and I would be able to communicate while biking, etc. even if we get separated.  I also purchased  a set of the long earbuds to go with it.  The earbuds allow me to use the HBC100 inside a bicycle helmet.  (Bicycle helmets don't allow space for the ear/mouth pieces that are standard.)  We were both impressed by the clarity!  Even when separated by distance it sounded as if we were right next to one another.  It makes biking a whole lot more fun when you can carry on a conversation!<br /><br />And the customer service is as good as it gets!  I had trouble pairing my first set due to a faulty unit, but Mark quickly and accurately diagnosed the problem and quickly sent a replacement unit.  After initial pairing, they pair automatically and are extremely easy to use.
B005JCS7JK|5|Super easy to replace my old tensioner for this new one.  Works great and would happily get one from Dayco again.
B006EGAIII|5|A great price on an item that cost much more in the local stores. It was free shipping so this was a great deal on a great product!
B004JK95US|5|Great quality. Much nicer than a typical keychain.
B001R9UTJ0|5|good product
B0068C4KPK|5|AAA
B0009IQZY8|5|AAA
B0031HBDDC|5|Perfect fit and Look!  Could not find it anywhere else.  Amazon is the best deal.
B0048J01RG|5|After 12 years my 2003 Sierra needed a little freshening up. These worked great to return the speed of the power windows. Only takes a 7mm and 10mm socket and a screwdriver to complete removal and installation.
B00X5FLEVQ|1|We ordered two and put in the year and model #.  It doesn't fit and we don't have a 3rd auto start button.
B000G72VHM|5|Worked great and fit just right
B00CFCHT0U|5|These are great floor mats and a great price too.  The quality is excellent and the fit perfect.<br />Craig Hill
B00E5XXFZA|5|Great! Very good quality
B00FMTHM3M|3|Not terrible for factory quality would probably consider an aftermarket brand
B00NAI5PHM|3|It was nice.I good have been better
B0041QEKZ0|5|Awesome deal
B00ISUNBPU|3|Missing sub cable. No web site listed to buy oprions.  poor instruction manual.
B000NP3AFE|5|Great product and vendor
B00VZO35QG|5|Worked great for what I was using them for...
B00IPS4APU|5|worked great, spider chip fixed, no stores in area had in stock, delivered to my door in 2 days....love it!
B004BWU8H8|5|Great product!!!  Easy install and great piece of mind.
B00LFL8K96|5|Fast shipping perfect fit
B000KKPFFA|1|The website shows this material (J-B Weld 8272) with product number 8272 having a 20-25 minute set time.  The actual product that I received is exactly the same as on the website (J-B Weld 8272) but says that it has a 4-6 hour set time.  See attached photos.  This is a deal breaker for me, given the location where I have to install it.  Did the product change?  I don't know.
B00UM8BZIQ|5|Had it installed by a profesional mechanic and he said he had no issues during the installation. It was installed in May 2015 and four months later its working as it should. Great price, customer service and shipping was fast.
B006A2VYPW|1|I was really disappointed in Anzo.  I had problems with the install.  I had to talk to the tech there three times before he figured it out.  Turns out you have to unplug a factory plug installed by Anzo and rotate it 180 degrees and worked fine.  No instructions came with the kit.  I found them on the Anzo Web Site.  Once we got it figured out, they look and work great!  I've emailed them and have not received a reply.  Not really impressed.  I wish they would have come wired right and with some instructions or at least a suggestion to go to the Anzo Web Site to get them.
B004ZF3A94|4|they great but at first the you turn it on the driver side didnt light up so we have to play with it other than that its fine Would def if you buying this get the anti flicker
B00GI81T0I|5|Heavy duty, durable. Only downside is white shows dirt like immediately, but that is to be expected.
B000C2PBC8|5|Perfect fit.
B00Q7HV6NA|1|Lasted 2 days I would say it's junk
B000ZIZHKK|5|My 2000 Ford Crown Victoria was misfiring and stuttering.  Replaced all 8 ignition coils and now running like a dream again!
B00355GPQA|5|This is definitely my favorite boat wash.  I have tried the regular Meguiar's soap, mothers, and sea brite.  Meguiar's flagship line is the best, hands down.  This cuts through everything, and leaves a nice vibrant finish.  Wish they made a bigger size!
B001AMAB0Q|5|Just what the doctor ordered.
B00CFPGDN6|5|Good fit, product was as described.
B00L4DN5CW|1|Keyless entry will not program... consider an alternative  supplier..
B00R59INIU|5|didn't last as long as i hoped
B00JRE38EA|5|Great product very bright white
B00AX03E2I|5|Nice product very satisfied
B001D6GYWS|5|8&#62; Thank You $$$ 8&#62; :D ^^
B0040UAVOG|4|So amazon can't bear an other language than English ??. Open your mind . You 're not alone!! The product is correct.<br />I apologize for the translation
B0031I5SZU|5|Looked like really nice exhaust. Well packaged in shipping box. Instructions clear.<br /><br />Unfortunately will not fit 2004 330ci Manual Convertible. Magnaflow tech support verified this fact over phone call. The xpipe brackets do not align. Also the 2.5&#34; pipes do not allow the use of existing bracket imediately after the downpipe flange or the crossmember support on the drivers side rear to bolt back on correctly.<br /><br />The only solution for catback bolt on system is Borla.
B00ITABX0O|5|Cute, quick and easy to apply.
B004JNJPLY|5|Perfectly designed for my 2008 Expedition. Only took 1 hour from start to finish. Very helpful video on YouTube.
B00IKWAD0C|5|They Look Great!!! I'm going to get another set of headrest covers for my back seat as well. Good quality Very pleased,Thanks
B00CCXE77U|4|Smaller than expected but still cute. Shipping was fast.
B00C5RB03W|5|Perfect fit
B00A2V6QRS|1|This is not for the 2008 Accord as indicted by Amazon compatibility. The manufacturer website confirms this is not compatible as well. This is for older model 2003-2007 and below.
B008JH6MJO|1|Ironically, I had the same experience.  3 different units, all three DOA. I would steal clear of this one.
B00GIZZGLO|5|Exactly like the stock one and good quality. Very fast shipping.
B002JJX2DW|5|Excellent quality.
B006RL3IZ0|4|Great product for a great price. The head rests are really loose on our 2015 fusion and the covers on the front seat are a tad loose but it still worth the buy.
B0033WNMA2|5|Fit my truck perfect. I have a 2005 Dodge Ram and this kit made the brake controller install too easy!
B00A3UNYW8|4|Works good on a 2014 Chevy Silverado, took about 5 minutes. Arrived quicker than expected.
B002UC8OWM|3|It works fine but attaches directly to the RV and door. My old one had a base plate in between and seemed to seal better.
B000F3RYGA|4|About what I expected. Allows me to secure trailer (and chains). Glad I have it, for peace of mind.
B00EJFH6YA|5|Awesome value, she really lights up what is in front of you!
B00H5D47K4|5|The back back is pretty cool. As soon as I saw it online I'm like yes, this would be very cool for back to school and help protect me on my motorcycle.  I just got the backpack and its alot larger then I thought it would be. If the picture looks about medium size then the actual bookbag is a good large for sure. The plate feels legit enough, The rivets will def need to be replaced with actual bolts for complete &#34;safety&#34; but other then that its great. Lots and lots of space, good buckles. They flap around alot so I bit of customizing for your body will be needed. But dont cut them off because after you actually put stuff in the bag your gonna need the extra straps to keep it snug on your body.
B0006Z9SQQ|5|This product is really great! I had some &#34;gunk&#34; stuck on the backseat of my car and this helped it get right out. I agree with the other reviewers that it has a nice smell as well.
B00IZR6F22|1|followed instructions to the letter and three days later my rav4 got a blinking check engine light. ended up taking car to dealer and installing factory plugs.
B00KTJ8D38|5|No matter what anyone says -- none of these can be programmed at home for the 2007 and later Hummer 3's.  They have to be programmed at a dealer -- locksmiths I tried couldn't do them either.  The keyless fobs just fine when programmed at the dealer, but a bit pricey (but what car dealer isn't pricey?)
B007AONLZK|5|I really like these shades. They fit perfectly for my van and thunderbird.  they cover the whole window which I wanted.
B004WO15F4|5|To the guy giving it a one star rating must have installed the struts with a potato. Seriously it's a great ride and gets rid of the goofy rake the stock ride has. Don't go above 2.1 if you're using stock upper control arms.
B011VNB75Q|5|Seems to be very sturdy. The metal part is much wider than it looks in picture. The handle is solid hard rubber.
B007X6OEYW|4|Does a good job of holding the wash water and gives me good reach for the top of my van.
B001DRN9EI|5|Perfect fitting , arrived on time
B00FQ0ROZS|5|date received excellent product
B00LHUI4XM|5|Beautiful and heavy duty!!  Great product and a company that cares about my satisfaction, thank you!!
B0000C6F6L|5|Fit the trailer perfectly!
B00B99U088|4|please
B000CN4XZI|4|Haven't had the product long enough to rate this a 5, but works great.
B000UV4V36|5|These turned out to be more of a purple color then pink but they look great paired up with my green and underbody kit!
B0006MTR7Y|4|Nice product, definitely much heavier than the standard hose.
B00KRNVPWM|4|works great. don't use heat on it or it shrinks up fast....
B00M78820I|5|Excellent car sun shade. It is flexible, easy to fold, gives good coverage.  The quality is very good. I would recommend it.
B00P1RU8PY|2|I used this product to attempt to secure a weak hinge on my laptop. The product smells like rotten eggs and the odor never goes away. Even worse, after two days of sitting to give it more than ample dry-time, it never held and the actual epoxy just flakes right off; making it useless. It doesn't actually bond... at all. After following the instructions to the letter, I was very disappointed at the results. I ended up paying a professional computer repair service to thoroughly clean the smelly residue off and to replace the hinge entirely.
B003NOAIHK|5|Thanks for the product
B0032YVDEI|5|Came when expected, quality is great
B0019I9SV4|5|It fits nicely to my 2001 Honda Accord Cat.<br />(But you will need Walker 31645 gasket too.  Front and back are different shape.)
B0030DCV42|5|The Strong Arm supports arrived when promised and were easy to install after viewing the email sent with the order confirmation.
B0040CYWX0|5|Perfect for 05-10 Mustang fender liners. Does not work on radiator cover or wiper cowl but absolutely PERFECT for fender liners and side skirts.
B00S9OW71Y|4|I bought the right and left, both seem to be made very nicely, but can't provide any long term feedback on performance at this time, since they have not been installed yet, but the cost was really competitive compared to others.
B00NAMDW9Q|4|Took a while to get but does the job and worth it.
B00LHSO5GO|5|This seemed hard to put on at first, but followed a YouTube and succeeded, with a small wrinkle. However, in the summer head of the car, it all adjusted to be perfectly smooth, and we are happy with it.
B00A8E0DIW|5|Works just as good as the Kia counterpart
B000CB50FC|5|It's been two years, and works perfectly good
B000M5ZWBA|5|THIS IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE, AND BUILT TO LAST.
B003G9FR8M|5|the pilot on the water heater would not stay lit.after replacing the thermostat the pilot would stay on and the water heater operated fine.
B000A6TIFM|5|It arrived the next day which was a pleasant surprise. It fits like a charm and looks good, too.
B001FSN6NO|4|I've had this for a few months, its smaller than expected, but doesn't leak.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Hi, I love this product but something broke. how can you help?
B0087OVL8G|5|Very good fluid highly recommend
B00XBEJZA8|5|Perfect light bar for my fourwheeler, wired up easy, did not come with a harness but I used some extra wire and added a fuse in line.
B000F3C3BQ|1|Made from great material BUT it didn't even come close to fitting correctly!
B005TDKZP8|3|I had to return. They sent me the wrong size. Well made and sturdy thick composite plastic.
B000CPI6VI|4|works as advertised
B001C4ROKM|5|Definitely does worth the price!..<br />Its white and strong, much better than stock 35w bulbs.<br />Also the shipment speed was faster than expected
B00U9YZ3MM|5|Everything great
B006ICL7MY|5|love it
B003YMBO2E|5|These look great and are durable. Attaching them to the Jeep is quick and easy. They have glue strips that hold them on securely. If you take your doors off, you definitely need these to prevent the dreaded door dimple. They do not look cheap and enhance the look of the Jeep.
B0046BFXD8|5|I like it and it feels great while driving.  I had to it on the floor of my truck with the heat on to stretch it over the steering wheel
B00RD2WE20|5|Excellent
B008YFSH44|5|Just what I needed for frozen trails
B00ML5K7Q4|4|Nothing to say.....it's just neat.
B0009PSA4O|5|I love this mirror on my pontoon boat. Can see everything going on behind me.
B00D38VU5U|5|It was perfact
B00OOY12EQ|3|A little fiddley to clip the glasses on and take them off. But just ok.
B00029K018|5|A+. Highly recommend
B001TK7CYM|3|Got these for my boyfriend when he got a new bike. He says their cool..don't know what that means but I guess for the price he likes them.
B00FBQKPI0|5|product came on time and undamaged. its great to go with my 98 Durango and is very good quality. very happy!
B004ZF3FJO|5|Great hid kit for the price. Packaging was a little sloppy as the parts had moved around inside the box. Everything worked great the first time though. Easy install.
B00Q2HTHTK|5|Works great on a 2011 Camry SE 2.5
B0074EJ9UM|5|Love this steering wheel cove so soft and comfy.
B00TQ044DO|3|I was really thrilled when i got this key change but over time the silver coating eventually turned a bronze color. If your fine with this one flaw i suggest u get this key chain cause thats the only problem that i right now. Pretty solid over all though
B00GHHU5NM|4|Awesome for the price and savings over OEM!!
B007EA6R0Q|5|As our three kids grow and get involved in more activities, we finally decided to trade in our Camry for an Odyssey and fix up our 2003 Pilot for the long haul. Being a guy, the first thing I did upon inheriting the Pilot was to trick it out with a new stereo--I went with the Pioneer App Radio 4, which has a touch screen, features Apple's Car Play, and can connect to other devices via Bluetooth and auxiliary cables. So far, I love this stereo, especially for the microphone and hands-free calls, texts (Siri reads them to you and takes dictation), and navigation through Car Play. Next up, I researched trailer hitches and decided on the Curt hitch for its durability and positive reviews. I had our mechanic install the hitch in addition to other work we had him do to make sure the Pilot is in good shape for years to come. Once I knew the hitch was good to go, I researched hitch-mounted bike carriers. This took a lot of time, as I wanted a carrier fit for 5 bikes that is both rugged and easy to use. The Yakima and Thule carriers are awesome, but they are expensive and get just enough mixed reviews that I decided to keep hunting. Eventually it came down to Allen and Curt. Curt won out because it is incredibly well built and attractively priced. The tapered arm design is ideal for adult and kids' bikes, and the straps are durable and don't leave black rubber marks all over hands and clothing. The carrier arrived a few days ago and was easy to assemble and install on the 2&#34; hitch. It mounts easily and does not shake or rattle. Yesterday we loaded up 2 bikes and drove to a bike trail about 8 miles away; the carrier and bikes remained perfectly stable, including going over speed bumps and through a construction site. The Curt carrier includes welded loops for a cable lock to secure bikes. The only thing I need to get now are a couple of bolt locks to secure the carrier to the hitch, though it would take some doing for someone to detach the threaded bolt that ensures a snug fit to the hitch itself.
B00B2QGBSG|1|Nothing Fits My Car What So Ever.
B009XIUFBE|4|As with all clymer manuals I've seen,it looks to be very well written and complete.
B007VSVQ52|5|I love this product. You can use it for so many different things. Works great with vinyl.
B0042HDM6G|4|The part worked beautiful  good job
B001AVSIOI|4|I really like the lock but ru be cover broke & fell off.
B000CFQ2XM|5|wrong fit sent back.  but looked like a very good air lift
B002ZTGLCK|5|Works perfectly.
B009M118OA|1|Didn't work, should have read earlier reviews - to date we have not received a refund.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Don't write a lot of reviews but I'll put in 2 cents for this carrier.  Mounted up easily on a Ford Focus then drove from Texas to Wisconsin w/ a pretty good amount of rain.  I stayed tight and everything stayed dry.  It was the daughters car so I left it for her to drive to Boston.  Don't know how long it will last but I would say it's well worth the $$$.
B000EDSSMA|5|Works great! We opted not to screw it down and it works just fine.
B0009IQXM2|5|Good product.
B00PUOQRK8|5|Very nice protector. It has a neoprene surface that faces the seat and a fabric side that faces out. You just put the top over the head rest and roll it down the seat. Mine did not slip at all while driving or getting in or out of the truck. I don't think there will be any issues of getting the seat wet.<br /><br />You can roll this up from the headrest end and there are two elastic loops at the bottom that you can use to keep it rolled. This was a nice feature. I have not decided on a storage area yet. I ordered one to evaluate it and I have already ordered one for the passenger seat. We are scuba divers and I wanted to keep my seats dry when I jump in with not so dry clothes.
B00K6L79K2|5|Fit perfectly, awesome delivery!
B00DK8Y92O|4|looks great, Ordered Black, got Silver. Still looks good so I can complain too much.
B002GTKAHQ|3|Definitely not the best mirrors but worth it for the price. These are very easy to install won't take more than 10 mins of your time. They have good and wide area of visibility but they do start to vibrate around 60mph speed also depending on the road condition will start vibrating at low speed.
B00183IRVM|2|I hate the disclaimers that come printed on the plate. No need.u think Hawaii police will know...or like me a fron
B00IWSS7X4|1|I purchased this item as a replacement for a 2010 Mini Cooper (R56). The quality is too low and I ended up going to the dealership to buy the OEM one for roughly $50 or so. I was able to juxtapose this item with the new OEM and the quality is absolutely different, from one side of the spectrum to another. Most noticeable difference between this and the OEM item is the spring strength (this one has a very weak spring) and the plastic housing itself feels much sturdier and tougher on the OEM. This may save you a few bucks but quite frankly the quality is too low for this to be an effective replacement.
B00HW1TLYQ|5|Love it!
B0002NIJVC|5|fit perfect
B00FC7SH9W|4|It's a nice product, but GPS shakes a little. Could be a little sturdier.
B001AKQCYW|5|My wife couldn't be happier with this.
B0009OMY9C|5|Works great
B004PXWKLA|1|The ones I got don't match the picture
B00BHYBPLG|5|Works well lots of car supported with updates available from website.
B0018L2LR0|5|My wife loves this. Great feel and fit our fusion great.
B0065FRBZ6|4|Perfect to the Suzuki Boulevard.
B0067UC02S|5|Perfect fit
B0048GJXJQ|3|pumps a little slow for me.
B003EP2QGO|4|Pretty good product overall. I'd like to of had more options though. It definitely helped my 09 Honda SI. I lowered the i-vtec 200 rpms, raised the rev limiter to 8500 and uped the speed limiter  to 186 to match the Michelin Z rated tires. The rev lag is still there but not as bad as stock. The throttle response at lower rpm's is noticeable. When under hard acceleration all the way to 8500 she really pulls then shift to second your still in i-vtec, it really does make a difference!
B00LDNH0CE|5|The customer service is great! One of my bulbs went out and told the seller about it. He sent me a new one and it worked good. I will buy more from Apex.
B000CPAVIY|5|Yes great paint :)
B007V5CT7E|5|Nice hitch.  Solid.  Ball slides on and off better than any coupler I have ever had.<br />Pay a little more, get quite a bit more IMO.
B00D3OVG1M|5|fit perfectly and work as described. love them, and the ability to pop them almost flush when not in use.
B00BABBNOU|5|Good looking sticker, is very small though.
B005O0QQ1S|5|Bought these for my Kia and Ford truck. I am a big guy with arthritis in my hands and these make using the seat belt a lot easier, to the point I want to use the seat belts all the time. Without these it was nearly impossible to buckle up ,so I rarely did. I even got a pair for my Mom's car and she loves them. Very well made and look nice in the car
B0002M9SCM|3|These are some of the higher-end Hella lights and as such, are made in Germany. So what? The quality isn't any better. I purchased these because they were the only amber fog lights available from Hella. Everything else had clear lenses and that's not what I wanted.<br /><br />The housings are still plastic and the lenses don't QUITE fit correctly. There's about a 4mm gap between the front of the reflector/lens and the face of the housing. It's really shoddy looking and is frankly disappointing for nearly a hundred bucks. On top of that, the covers don't really fit correctly so I had concerns about them falling off. To put it in perspective, the &#34;Made in Taiwan&#34; Hella 700's are actually made BETTER than these.<br /><br />As far as performance is concerned, these produce a truly amber beam that is wider and sharper than the PIAA 520s I replaced them with. The beam is extremely wide and the cut-off is on par with a projector/HID light; pretty impressive. Likewise, these throw down light that would make a yellow canary disappear.<br /><br />If all you care about is performance and nothing else, these are the lamps for you.
B00G1Y4F5A|5|Great product. Shipped quick and installed in 2 mins. Much better over stock levers.
B00407RRGY|5|Works OK for old car....
B000BO71M0|5|Used on my RV. Really sticks tight, reflects well and seems weather/winter ice and snow proof (so far).
B009X1X3V0|3|Good concept but Weight capacity on Jeep O.E.M. tailgate is 50 pounds (need upgraded tire swing to handle the weight of this item & its cargo)
B006GCJ4UI|5|Worked great easy to install all of the wires were numbered
B00EPFMFZ4|4|This works fine but don't think you'll be able to read the instructions and the website listed no longer exists. But a half smart person can figure out how to use it without help.
B000AA4RWM|5|Sticks well, good size, in my RV.
B003RQBKLC|4|Works great is bulky...I set it in one cup holder..
B0027FT8BI|4|Fits very well and looks great in my 2015 pro-4x CC.  The only reason I can not give the mats 5 stars is because they seem to shift around a bit too much. These mats do not have the plastic/rubber spikes on the bottom surface so the only thing holding them in place is the 2 factory floor mat retention studs/posts.  Great product, but could be better in regards to this detail.  I chose a husky liner for the back because the frontier forum said this was the best combination. There is no cut out for the factory sub enclosure with the Weathertech, whereas the husky liner has one to allow for proper fitment.
B005EGMUKS|5|works great
B00ONHDZ1C|5|just what we needed
B000CKJEI2|5|Better quality than the switch I was replacing.  Installed in an aftermarket tilt column that had broken due to the turn signal arm being caught on my cargo shorts.  This piece fit perfect and appears to be sturdier than the one that came out.
B000CLMX0W|1|Guys! These are not what they proclaim to be. I ordered these for my 2008 Volvo C30. I know they fit other applications as well, so hopefully this review reaches many of you. Well, while they &#34;appear&#34; to be OEM, they are furthest thing from it. First off, I want to mention I took the vehicle to an ASE-certified technician for installation, to dis spell any user-error theorists out there reading this. The two horizontal small raised &#34;pins&#34; you see pictured on the lower right pad (which is the outer pad) conflict with the rotor-to-caliper clearance requirements needed for proper wheel rotation. And the vertical pinned pad (lower left picture) is designed to rest inside of the female pins on the caliper piston face, which they do not. As soon as the job was finished, the problem was detected. Both rear wheels were completely frozen. So after tearing back into the job, the pins were ground off, the pads were reinstalled, and after a test drive, the brake pedal was way too low. I initially thought they would pump up after a little bit and restore my pedal, but nope! I drove around for about 30 miles in city, and when I stopped I could smell the asbestos protruding from the rear wheels. I stepped out to inspect, and both sides were smoking. Yes, smoking, indicating that the wheels were dragging thanks to these ridiculous pads. I went to the nearby Volvo dealer 5 minutes later and purchased the OEM organic pads, and also had to purchase new OEM rotors since the blazing hot friction action of the Wagner pads likely warped and ruined my otherwise old but still good rotors. I returned to the ASE certified mechanic with the new bundle and had him put everything on. End result: normal pedal, no sticking pads and free spinning motion of the rear wheels was tested before lowering the car. Bottom line: 'Hit the brakes' on these and do not purchase them if you at all care about your vehicle.  They cost me an additional $200 just to replace the rotors they ruined, endless time, and the OEM pads from the dealer were only about $40 more than these Wagner nightmares are at retail. Wagner needs to go back to the design board and re-evaluate the genetics of these so-called higher-end pads.
B004BCJ6T4|4|👍
B006WQSF4O|5|Several thousand miles on this bearing and no issues. C6 vette
B004I0FF0I|2|Colour does not match oem
B004I0YK2C|4|The fog light assembly was exactly as described, arrived on time, fit perfectly, worked perfectly, and was at a very good price.
B008VT1PZ6|3|It is a good product
B004IARHFE|5|Perfect replacement for my stock unit.
B00JH0NVDW|5|I had a question about the belt,was very pleased they took the time to help me.The belt works fine.Bob
B007V2EKYM|5|High quality
B000V92BD4|5|Excellent craftsmanship. I've recommend this site to all my friends.
B00BITJCKQ|2|It got shipped to the wrong address,  then when I finally got it, it was missing the coil on the inside so I had to take the coil out of the old one, which was covered in oil so idk if it's working as good as it should be.
B0036QZ8VQ|1|First time taking the bike up on the rear stand and after rotating the rear wheel a few times when applying degreaser, the bike tipped over.
B000GU293U|5|Overall improved design. The inside is truly water tight. Not like the old design tail light.
B000NBKI7Q|4|Worked great - instructions are very general. This is a home mechanic job if you have patience and the right tools. Only problem was that I needed the smaller (70mm - Gates #38008) idler pulley mentioned in the instructions, but not included. Was happy my local NAPA store had it in stock as the car wasn't going anywhere without it. It appears this belt will not be slipping off anytime soon.
B00BMPXGHQ|1|I order a 240 volt adapter and receive the 250 volt adapter so it doesn't fit my generator and have no idea haven't returned it!?!?
B005GNUOTS|3|It's okay.
B00B3YN928|4|Just got the bag and it is awesome. Would have given it 5 stars but the box it came in was two small so the packer bent the back of the bag in 1/2 to get it in and the back of the bag is the hard side. When I removed it from the box it seems to have a permenant bend in it. I have put a piece of wood in it to see if I can get it to staighten out. If not I will return it for another one. Otherwise I love the bag and I haven't even used it yet. If you order it please ask them to be sure and not bend the bag but to ship it in a box big enough for the bag. Update 09-02-15 Well it seems to have resumed its original shape although the back panel sitll has a slight tendancy to resume its bent shape. I am going to keep it and hope everything goes well. Like I said you can't beat this bag for the priced. It seems a little heavy for the luggage rack on my Goldwing but I will pack it with the light stuff we want to get at quickly. Love the bag.
B00SH2CX2Q|2|Cheap and thin feeling.  I never actually put it on a bike.  Shelled out the extra dough and went with a Progrip.
B00R33UUQQ|3|Great product at a fabulous price.  It was supposed to come with additional cheek pads to make it a better fit for narrower faces, but it didn't.  I have yet to contact amazon.  If they correct this, I will edit the review.
B00JQ95ULA|5|Very nice!!!
B00QN86FC0|5|Works great. Easy installation. Gives a perfect amount of light to keep the waters lit while we are pullin up monster catfish from the lakes and rivers. You can't pull up monster catfish like this when it's pitch black out without having a light to light the way.  It's the Rudoplh of lights!
B004I12424|5|Perfect!
B001DKM3SI|5|Great replacement for another long-handled extension car washing gizmo that I had. It does what it says it does and does it well. Price was right. Seems sturdy enough. So far so good after about 10 washes with the durability of the extension plastic handle which, along with the actual mop connector to the head are the two things I have always had trouble with in the past with similar tools. What more can you say?
B00F0VMMSW|5|Great product
B000C2ZJIY|1|didn't match the picture, the one that came is straight.
B01093PU2K|5|These are all really great, great addition to my mouse pad to extend it and take pressure off my arms!  In the car nice and comfortable!  For these prices I have several!
B00A7MIWFQ|5|These are Bilstein's OEM replacement series shock W/spring, which were design to provide equivalent ride height and quality compare to the rear SACHS shock & spring that came with your 2005 and prior Mercedes Benz ML350.<br /><br />* * * This is for 1 side (either side), not A pair. And do not purchase it for your front end suspension repair, that is torsion bar. * * *<br /><br />I was worrying about the changing in ride quality. Bilstein are know for riding harsh, but that's not the case here. these are not any harsher or softer than your original SACHS shocks and springs.<br /><br />Installation would not be an easy task due to mounting location of the shock (4+ hours). That's why I recommend these complete package over changing the spring alone. You'll save time and money on labor.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied after 3 month of use.
B00JW1WU1A|5|Absolutely perfect fit, easy install, great price!
B00L35NEUY|5|These are fun and ridiculous. The install was really easy, required no tools and look very similar to the pictures.
B00JUIY2UW|5|Excellent buy. Saved me a lot of money.
B000KEUFME|1|No mounting bracket. Power meter doesnt work. Swr is off. The antenna function doesnt work at all - and this is after thry gave me half off for not having a mount bracket. Junk.  Threw it in the trash.
B0102RMK0S|5|Good color match. Pearl really popped when cleared
B00ESBOL3E|4|I was interested in ordering a light bar from Amazon and after clicking on millions of selections and reading tons of reviews I chose this light bar from ZHOL. The price to review ratio was pretty good so I thought I would take a chance. I live in Mass and shipping took about a week from Cali. When it was delivered I was taken back by the box. On the side of the package it clearly states LED LIGHT BAR. As a recommendation if you live in a high theift neighborhood I would have this either picked up from UPS /FedEx or have special instructions on delivery. The unbox was very surprising on the quality of protection it came with. About an inch of rigid styrofoam all the way around. When inspecting the light for defects I immediately noticed one minor thing. The sealant they used to waterproof the lense dribbled across the inside of the lense. A little upset with that discovery I reminded myself I only paid $70 for it be happy. As a precaution i put a thin layer of clear silacone around the lense so it would not leak and cause condisation. I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING EXTREMELY CLEAR . . . THE BAR IS NOT 50&#34;. With three measurements it comes up around 51¾&#34;. The hardware that came with it seemed a little cheap and if not using the side mounts you will need some washers and lock washers. The housing does seem fair probably could take beating from branches on the trail but not a limb at 50mph. The wire that was prefabricated on the light was about 14&#34; long and 10Ga. Wire. When lit its no joke it is bright, but probably not like a Ridgid Ind. Overall I am extremely happy with this light and just can't beat the price for this product if any questions let me know before buying I'll do my best to anwser
B00O06NFTS|3|They did not really fit the rear seat in our 2013 Chevy Silverado 2500 HD.  Further, they were not labeled as to what fit what and it had to be sorted out by trial and error to start with.  Finally, it was extremely difficult installing the rear seat covers as the seats are bolted to the back of the cab and it made passing the straps that hold the seat coves in place very difficult.  In sum, they were quite difficult to install and do not fit well.  The front seats were fine and easier to install.

B0033WDI0G|3|I have a 2012 Transit. I installed the CURT receiver hitch in 20 minutes. However, when I went to install the wiring harness I had no luck. I called my Ford mechanic. After 3 hours he had it installed and it works great. Not sure if a cheaper one would work any better or worse.<br />The only way he could route the wires was to cut them. Thats right he had to cut all of them. The 2012 transit doesn't have large enough holes to pass the connectors thru. The only way to get them thru was to cut the wires and route the wires only. That is why I did not attempt to install the harness myself.<br />It works great now but not being very good with cutting and splicing I would not do the job myself. I did save over $200 from the quote that I got from Uhaul. But it was anything but plug and play. I gave it 3 stars because the quality of the parts were high.
B000M8IF1Q|5|Easy to use, does the trick.  Even quieted brake pads that were new and squealing by applying the grease to the back of the pad.  It is a little messy to use, but that is the nature of grease.  The tube is big enough for two to four all round brake changes depending on how much you like to use on each brake set per caliper.
B00AYI1EPI|4|Nice<br />Tough to put on<br />Makes for a thick steering wheel<br />Overall very happy
B00029WYEY|5|great product
B00HR0BCZI|5|Works and fits great. Does what it is suppose to do.
B00FMV0WFA|5|Not much more to say than that. :-)
B000C5FL84|5|Easy to replace.
B00CC4LX2G|1|Doesn't fit Toyota RAV4
B00A46GPBI|5|perfect  thanks
B0010G5X6Y|5|Quick shipping exact replacement and no need for the wire connector like in the passenger side
B004L0P1M2|5|I got this pretty quick that works great
B00E9HWQ2U|5|great fit for toyota 4runner
B0046VSD6W|5|very good
B00BDPFPNI|5|So happy to find this easy-to-install part on Amazon. The only place I have been able to find it (and I've looked at several auto part stores). Literally took me less than a minute to install. Easy. Perfect. Done.
B003SRHNE8|1|It sucked , didn't even fit my jeep pointless piece of s***
B00ELBCSZY|3|Material is kinda thin expected better outta dickies
B0009H51MG|1|my bad...i ordered the wrong one, so I don't know how it is
B000P3WW76|1|This item would not fit the original equipment hitch on my 04 Tahoe. The holes were in the wrong place.
B000C59XKG|5|It worked great !!!!!!!! It worked great !!!!!!!! It worked great !!!!!!!! It worked great !!!!!!!!
B00VAY6C8O|4|Fit my Honda Civic Coupe OK after trimming with everyday household sizzors, good quality mats with no smell, nice raised channel to keep spills off of carpeting. I am pleased with this purchase, arrived quickly!
B00AQ4VIWE|5|A++++
B00HTOB0NG|5|Actually I didn't need these but am giving a five star review because with Kensun's help we determined that I didn't need them and Kensun provided a return shipping label for a refund. From what I did see, they appeared to be well made and not flimsy.
B008N21SX0|5|A little bigger than expected, desired but otherwise perfect.
B00K8VQNGG|2|Cute, but smells like vomit. Luckily, the smell only lasts less than a week.
B00AZ9ZZZ6|1|Purchased this product specifically to monitor Dex-Cool antifreeze.  I used it to test a newly purchased gallon of Havoline 50/50 premixed antifreeze (-34 degrees F freeze point).  This tester consistently gives readings indicating a -10F freeze point for the new antifreeze.  I called the Havaline tech service and was advised that the only way to accurately determine the concentration ( freeze point) of this coolant was to use a Spectrometer / Refractometer.  I will be returning this product.
B00E1L72RS|4|its doing a good job for what it supposed to do.  I attached picture showing it shading my 1997 BMW 3 series.  The front one is actually big enough to cover most of the window, especially when I let the window down a bit for air circulation.  for back window I wish its bigger.<br />I also put a putty between the suction and the shade.  so far its been working very well. I can fold the shade and the suction cup stayed on.
B00NQF51DM|5|Was very pleased with all 3 items, it was a birthday present for my son. I would have liked the 3 items to have arrived together. Next time will have to choose more carefully.
B005FG28K4|3|This light is good for vehicle visibility, but would not suggest it for use in an emergency response. Not the brightest light around but still a great price!
B009PPL604|5|Works great
B00KBB8AUU|5|Exactly as described. Just what I needed
B003VUY72S|5|Quick nice
B000K3EV0W|4|Sits straight, doesn't move, but I do wish that jackets laid a little better on it.
B00877SL2M|3|They don't last that long when I use them on the license plate,  they start blinking a week after they are installed
B00HQZNOQO|5|The part came on time as promissed and looks great with the leather seats and fits just like OEM.
B000C53XRK|2|It is too early to tell if it is satisfactory yet or not.
B0095TC6I6|3|The quality of the hardware and setup is good. The visual quality and clarity of the mirror surface is not as good as my vehicles side mirrors. Somewhat distorted. Since factory tow mirrors are not available for my year of Ram pickup (2013) with heated mirrors I thought these would work and they do for the most part. It is just the clarity of the mirror is just not that great. Maybe I got a defective pair that the factory did not catch before shipping. I did email Milenco in the UK where the mirrors are manufactured about the lack of visual clarity. Will see if they respond.
B00553SMKM|5|Thanks
B00CMX20H4|5|You more or less have to plan to fabricate a mount for whatever application you're going to use it on. The instructions are pretty specific, you want to mount it as upright as you can. Not too difficult. Comes with a relay, but I recommend the horn relay wiring kit to make installation a little easier.<br /><br />But holy crap, this thing turned my 650cc bike into a freight train. Highly recommend. Might put one on my car now too lol.<br /><br />Oh, and not any real discernible delay when pressing the horn button. Maybe less than .5 seconds to build up air pressure.  And I used the snorkel option since it was being mounted behind my front wheel. Piece of fuel hose worked just fine.
B00IV735L0|1|not the right part.
B00KTHX8NU|5|Fast shipping, good product. Had the local Dodge dealer program the remotes. Only $49 for them to program them.
B00SSJA122|5|Love this! Perfect size too. Put this on hubby's truck. Looks awesome
B00NUM7NU0|1|Poor quality wires - 2 failed within 3 months and 2000 miles of install. One completly came apart at the plug
B0083G3AXC|5|I purchased for my Brylanehome Padded Zero Gravity Chair.  It works great but you do have to remove (just slide off) every time you fold the chair up.  I just put between the folds for storage.
B002MEOZNK|1|Lens is falling out...very cheap.
B000C31J9G|5|I have been using these Fram Cabin air filters for years now.  Well made and reasonably priced.
B00JQQJOEW|4|it worked  as advertised
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Excellent lights for the money, I'm buying more myself!!
B000E7SY02|5|Product as describe
B0058WXNOK|2|hard to use...so I didn't/
B00842A7F4|5|Works great.
B000O51VJ0|5|Love this thing.  Campfires are banned in our state this year, so using this at our campsites is wonderful.
B00CXBFG3U|5|Will fit just fine in RV when rerouting heating ducts in kitchen area.
B000GU5IH4|4|It's ok. Does not keep moisture out though. Heavy humidity, bikes still damp. Keeps blowing dust out though.
B0015CIYMS|3|Tight fit and clearances not exact, had to do modifications in order to make it work correctly.
B00XG3X1SQ|5|Good look to my Nissan Xtrail 2016, fits perfect
B0041CDORE|5|only have it on about 2 weeks now but easy to install and works really well
B005DX6BKW|5|I installed these on my 2011 Kia Optima [no running lights] Installation took about 1 hour  and had no problem wiring them up. Because the mounting brackets were lightly painted metal ,I coated the brackets in neversieze  before bolting them to the grille to keep them from rusting prematurely. The lights are metal with a bonded glass lens and very sturdy. Have had them on for a year and am very satisfied with how they look and how they work. Well worth the money.
B00Z7ZH08I|5|Great product,fit perfect and bolts were the size needed for cb750 handlebar.
B000CKSXE8|1|Returned unit.  Did not have shroud, tube was bent
B00877SL2M|4|Delivered on time as expected, one out of the first three did not work,  considering the price still a great deal. Will order again.
B001G7W3CO|1|it was too short
B000S88HSQ|5|Fit perfect on my cobra backrest. I have a 2008 dyna superglide.
B00SVD37NK|4|I got the large size. Perfect fit my lg3. Has a inside pocket also. Strong magnet hold well.
B007TKJMB2|5|This is my second time purchasing the cover. These are half the cost of the ones I used to purchase and last as long or longer. I live in Arizona where the Sun and wind can be tough. Holds up pretty well to the elements where I live.
B0024NSWTC|5|Honda Pilot aftermarket headlight assemblies work well.
B008IK7TSA|5|Great
B00GRHRTEU|4|A necessity for doors off driving, Easy to attach, but they do whistle like crazy above 30mph, have to do the tape trick someone mentioned in a previous review. Need lots of tightening to stay in place. Included bolts rusted in 1week.
B000LQ78YY|5|These things are actually fairly eye catching on flash mode and I love being able to stick them to a vehicle. I have a set of 3 in each car and as finances allow will be buying an additional 3 per vehicle. Highly recommend the Amazon rechargeable batteries as these do not come with batteries as the description notates.
B0070YPITW|5|I can't believe I waited so long to get this! Absolute best invention ever to combat the hot Florida sun turning my pleather seats into infernos! No need to fight other people for the shady spots. If you live where it's hot and are sick of your thighs and lower back burning and sweating every day due to the flimsy sun screens that come with your mini, buy these!
B0055DO40Y|5|Great product. I works better than I had hoped.
B0024GU198|4|looks great but it sit on top of my head too high I think
B000FPX5M0|5|Makes car much louder.  Not sure about increasing HP.
B00029WYVW|4|This is a must have item if you own a K&N drop-in air filter. The cleaner is very strong and a little oil goes a long way. Just read the direction on the bottle and you'll be good to go. I wished the cleaner came in a aerosol can and not a pump...finger gets tired quickly. That's my only issue with this product. Hope this review helps.
B00CELSRW6|5|Very nice,but expensive...
B0000UUU4Q|4|I like the manuals over the unreliable automatics, that's a given. But these hubs have some shortcomings, apparently as cost-cutting engineering from Warn.<br /><br />First, they still have the 1/4-turn actuation, which is not much leverage. Engaging -- no problem, you just twist and the spring load will push the splines into place as the axle turns. But disengaging, now you're fighting spline friction with low mechanical advantage. You just have to have the wheels loose/unloaded or you won't be able to disengage -- not always an easy requirement to meet in off-road situations. The other 3/4-turn designs from MM or RR are superior here.<br /><br />The real bugaboo is that the actuators are plastic. Ordinarily, this won't be a big deal, keep them lubed and they won't wear out. Don't use pliers EVER and they won't break. Sadly, my hubs got very hot due to a braking issue, and the dang plastic pieces actually melted. The hubs went into partial engagement, with ugly grinding noises and the potential for lots of metal filings getting into my wheel bearings. Bummer.<br /><br />My next set will be all-metal and 3/4-turn.
B000SBCHCA|5|Works well
B004XG3R3O|5|This is the 2nd one I've purchased. The 1st got hammered by a traffic accident, so I need to get another.
B0011YHOE4|5|So far very satisfied with this part.
B00ZQXTZNE|5|Nice and bright
B001AMCC80|5|Easy install, took about 15 minutes each when done with a leaf spring swap.
B00390BS7C|5|this lil lifesaver was worth its weight on gold it made the job of removing and installing the Oxygen sensor a total breeze if you need to replace you sensor  get you ONE!!!
B00BITLPII|4|Works great
B009JTCLDW|5|Fit perfectly!!!
B007JOHHWY|5|nice and bright, easy drop in upgrade!
B0000AY4YJ|5|I bought this item not realizing it said rv and marine but it works great for my car couldn't be more pleased at how clean and shiny my interior looks after application...I would definitely recommend
B005LXTOEY|5|Perfect fit. Easy install via Youtube video I found. Only only took me 30 minutes. Delivery was VERY fast. Which was important due to the fact that my window was stuck DOWN! I would recommend these sellers.
B00T3TQLKW|4|Got exactly what I wanted, Only rated 4 because I haven't had the fan for long enough.
B007TYLQ8A|5|Perfect fit , good price
B002UC8PRG|5|Perfect! Rockwood pop up camper.
B00C7Y8FGS|1|Threaded insert came undone.  Difficult to remove because it just spun with the bolt.  In all fairness, they offered a return, but it was too much trouble for a $12 part.
B00681BE2S|5|Worked perfectly and took literally two minutes to program!
B001AD1GEA|5|Great shield. Been using it for several months with no cracks or chips.
B00S1F51MS|5|Great Price, fast shipping, good quality fuel filter at half the OEM price.
B000CCMLD0|5|Does what it's supposed to. Would buy again.
B00075XCJE|5|Definitely a Great Purchase for Class 3 hitch, Installed relatively easy and all hardware/install info was included. Very strong reviews online on various searches for this hitch.
B007WEQP6U|5|Good quality.
B011BTMDQM|5|Work great
B001ZTUTSI|5|Snapped right onto my Scorpion EXO helmet! No problem at all. I love how dark it is. Wearing with my prescription sunglasses is borderline too dark but it's ok if I'm a passenger. I wouldn't try to ride myself with both on.
B009FKWTO6|5|My daughter was quoted $1100.00 for a new compressor with installation and all that goes with it.  I talked to my daughter on the phone and she said she still had AC but just a loud growl. I researched it and a new clutch is all that is needed.  I paid 109. Easy install. There are a few videos on u tube that will take you through it step by step.
B00QEJD0P8|5|Better than expected heavy vinyl high quality
B003CR2ILM|4|Overall fitment is okay but could be better. Love the performance! Much better response. Absolutely love the growl the truck has when at full throttle.
B00IZQ0LKU|5|Just what I wanted
B00AUMKVN4|3|love the price and it fits just fine on my bike
B00S1IAW4W|3|They are pretty tricky to install, and they don't look amazing (fashion wise), but they do the trick of keeping my seats protected very well!!
B002ZBWKAU|4|I was surprised at how small it was and, therefore, skeptical as to how well it would work.  When I first ordered it, I didn't need it but was no longer in an environment where I could just get my tire aired up if it was low.  Then, about a week or so after I got it, my low tire light came on.  It didn't work at first, but I think it had to be plugged in for about a minute or so before it would work.  Once I got it going, it was fine.  It is a little loud, but hey, you got a flat or a low tire so who cares!  It took a couple minutes to air up my tire 10-12 lbs.  It fits in my spare tire compartment just fine.  It's a keeper.
B00O0PPRLI|3|This is very difficult to get over the camper for me and my husband. Even with the hooks provided to help, it still took us around 30 minutes. It did seem to last well the first year. We had a few winter storms last year and it seemed to hold up decent. There are a few holes in it now, but nothing I wouldn't expect due to the weather here. Not bad value for the price.
B00G8W0KWW|3|not very good, the light is dim
B00KPWBDZY|5|Love these side steps looks awesome. easy to install.
B0080MXQFQ|1|They're not as shown in the picture. The color is not gray, it's some weird light blue or aqua. I hate them.
B000IY2B5U|5|Works perfect, my mustang had a noise and didint whant to start ,it fix it the only hard part was putting it in in the same position but it work
B00V9QK266|5|on the original order, 1 was bad. the company replaced quickly and I have not had a minutes trouble since. These are bright as I needed/ expected. I would buy more in the future.
B001IJ33EW|1|The purpose of a sticker - by it's very name mind you - is to indeed...stick.  This one does not.  Great pic though.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Just received my scorpion and, although I've no used it it, I love the looks. I look forward to using it soon. It came charged and ready to go.
B00KTIYXLU|5|This review is for - 2 KeylessOption Replacement Keyless Entry Remote Control Key Fob Clicker Transmitter - Black sold by World Wide Remotes and fulfilled by Amazon. They arrived quickly and as described. I purchased these to replace our one remote that stopped working. We own a 1999 Ford Explorer. It was easy to program and they are both working great! The price was affordable and I even splurged on One Day shipping to get it faster. I would definitely recommend World Wide Remotes. Thanks for the great product!
B01088DY2Y|5|This is a great product unless you have a suitcase size purse. I bought it to hold maps n stuff when travelling but I use it for all kinds of stuff.
B003L9K9HQ|4|I can now open wide my windows which were never open more than a few inches.  This stuff wqorks.
B000CSW7GK|4|thanks
B0110CO95S|3|A lot nonsense stickers kindof sad but there some good one in here
B0000AZ6WB|4|Good quality and cheaper than west marine.
B001DDH088|2|The product that is shown is not what you get, you only get a needle and a holder.  You have to build the rest.
B000GTYLZ0|5|Just what I was looking for and for a decent price
B00Z7KIZPA|2|Did not work for my car. I have a transit connect. Also it will not hold a large purse
B001EOV46U|5|Another inexpensiuve tool that will help with any wiring using it's format.,
B0066QWCA8|5|Worked perfectly.  You have to be careful not to bend the pins inside when attaching though.  I learned that the hard way.
B001AIZ5HY|2|This unit of lens restoration failed to meet the needs and get my covers clened
B00KCQSM9S|3|Cheap Fabric But was good for covering the seats when we move things around, etc. Not a long term fix.
B001C6L5H8|5|Great fit fast shipping<br />Thankd
B009ZSKNEG|5|My Alfa SeeYa motorhome has a very high roof line as it has 71/2 foot ceilings. I needed the extra 18 inches to provide the proper clearance and this worked out just fine.
B007ZH6HMQ|5|Great product
B000CPIJOC|1|Listed incorrectly by Amazon.  It did not fit my 2005 Chevy K3500 dually.
B00FAV94I8|4|As stated in other reviews it can be difficult to position this guard centrally. It is not quite the same curve as the Countryman bumper but does provide protection to the top surface with a thick ridged mat.
B001DF9PRU|5|Very nice kit. It's quiet. Easy to clean filter. You have to cut a little plastic out of air box but nothing that would keep you from returning it to stock if you wish. I installed it and it went smooth and took little time
B00EIR7QM6|4|Fits perfectly on 2014 spyder st. At little hesitant to place during TX heat.... Afraid glue attaching Velcro will melt.
B004D0I11S|5|Great!!!!
B002LGEMOQ|5|Installed in a Marine application.  I own a 29 Sea Ray and was looking for an AC power solution while away from shore power.  It was between this and a small gas generator (Honda 2000).  Having friends with the gas generators, even though they are quiet, I couldn't imagine relaxing with that going in the background.  Connected to 3x 31M deep cycle 100 AH batteries in series and 0 Gauge 3 foot connections and a 250 amp fuse as recommended by the manufacturer, this inverter was able to easily power my fridges, fans in the cabin, and cell phones etc, plugged in, very stable power, lasted 6 hours on the water, batteries did not drop below 12.5 volts all day.<br /><br />I did try to push this by plugging in everything I could find, ipad, cell phones, 120v air pump, all at the same time.  I got it up to a constant 1500 watts via the inverters panel, which alternates between system volts and output wattage.  The cooling fans kicked on for a bit, but was cool to the touch after 15 minutes.<br /><br />After reading some questionable reviews on Amazon for this product, I have to assume people are incorrectly connecting this unit, or are using a power source which doesn't supply enough Amps/Voltage for the inverter to function as its capacity.  I am glad I gave this unit a try.  Very good, clean power, seems to be very efficient as well.  Xantrex knows what they are doing.
B000E3VHW8|5|After I purchased my catback system for my 2013 Dodge Dart, I was worried that my exhaust is too loud, especially for kids and my parents, decided to get this resonator and oh God, I should've done this earlier! such a huge difference... might be getting 2 more to make it even quieter !
B0006MWPZU|2|fit poorly
B00559O9A8|5|I put these on a 2010 2SS Camaro and it was a simple install all I had to do was trim the dust shield
B00EZBSBHY|5|Looks just like OEM perfect fit on my 04 Rx8. Super easy to install just need a socket wrench.
B00BMU93O6|5|The rim covers are actually quite nice, taking into consideration that 1 rim cover alone will cost you $50 these 4 covers are a no brainer. They aren't the most expensive looks rims but neither are the $50 dollar ones you would be getting. The installation was easy and painless and overall this product is a great deal for bargain shoppers.
B003Y3ZI5W|4|Works good once I figured out how to use it
B007WMY64A|1|Really?
B00K5MW7ZE|1|TOO SMALL IT NOT FIT TO MY CAR IN BASE OF MEASURE  IN ITEM DESCRIPTION<br />BUT IT IS MADE WITH EXCELLENT MATERIALS
B00CIGE67M|1|junk did not fit seller charge aloot to return buyer beware
B000SOM9GQ|5|I don't know how  Anti-Theft they are. With a nut on the back I had no trouble taking the nut off and removing the bolt. I do think it would take a someone extra time to remove the plate with these.  I bought two sets, one for my motorhome and one for my Harley. So far they still have the plates on them. Would buy again.
B0068EQ9W0|5|good deal
B000B6CVZU|4|Adjust rubber hood stops for a lighter pull on lever after installation.
B003NTV8EC|1|These are junk! Not only did the protection cap fall apart the first day but the coax center conductor from the male part of the PL259 adapter was missing, luckily I had a spare!
B000WJZ4DM|5|Perfect fit
B00EKTIBKS|5|Great looking addition to my 2011 Chevy silverado. Very durable covers. My brother recommend these to me after having them on his truck for 2 years, I thought they were factory chrome. These are also a fraction of the cost and labor of replacing the door handles with OEM chrome.
B00JBIDCOS|5|Arrived quickly! looks nice on my gold 02 civic
B002CN2812|5|Worked perfect.
B0002SR8AK|4|The tool made the adjustment easy on my 2003 crown vic. Worth the money to use one time for me.
B00GSZQ8NE|3|Interior lights work well with the exception of the vanity mirrors. The LED bulbs are ~2 mm too long and will not fit. Exterior are OK, but the license plate bulbs seem to direct the light in the wrong direction.
B003TM6ROE|5|Looks great on my new Terrain but they should give these to you for buying from the dealer.
B010GC0HPY|5|Nice heavy duty wrench.
B004MDEV38|5|Easy install on 2001 Honda Odyssey. Looks and works great.
B00KTHV5SK|5|Saved me a lot of money instead of going to the car dealership!!
B0006H92RY|5|Always keep a package around the RV. Good buy for us folks in the country.
B00V8IPF8U|2|It doesn't come with instructions.
B006RUJ2D8|5|Worked very well.
B006UBKRN8|5|Always been a fan of quality helmets. This is ther lightest helmet out. Best of all has the largest window shield to see the road and everything around thus less chance of getting into an accident. Yes this helmet is one of the most expensive ones but ask yourself, how much is ur life worth.
B004VY6M3A|5|Love it! I throw all the receipts in there.
B00BF2DH6Q|3|My original keyed gas cap (2003 Z-1000) was getting corroded shut. This cap looks grate. My bike is primarily garage kept, but I do have it outside about a month or two during the riding season.<br /><br />- I bought this in October 2013.<br />- Cap faded to light black (see pics)<br />- Opening and closing of cap is pretty easy, but can sometimes be tough if pressure is built up in tank after riding.
B003ZIMKXO|5|It's a great headlight.  Looks great, bright, very visible
B007ZDFV4U|5|Very classy looking! Perfect addition to my caddy! Definitely not like the &#34;cheap&#34; ones you find in stores. Love it!
B001AIZ5HY|5|If you take your time, this kit does what it says.  I used a corded drill, not a cordless one, since I don't think that my cordless drill, even with two batteries would have lasted long enough to do the job.  My drill is a 600 RPM model and I ran it on high.  The instruction with the kit say 1000 RPM, but I got excellent results.
B0071JJYLO|4|its ok
B001P2F34U|5|Quality and simple instillation
B00V312RVK|5|Freightliner Cascadia/Jensen VX7022
B0093XZG1S|3|purchased Bestline for three different vehicles.  I have used one in my 2010 Mercedes R350 Too soon to make proper evaluation of product.
B004QBNA8I|5|Fit perfectly. Dealership wanted $175 to purchase and install.  Took me 10 minutes!
B00WZXA7EO|4|This is the first time I've used a replacement hubcap. They are easy to install but I've noticed a few of them are not tight enough to prevent it from spinning on the wheel. The adjustment, bending a heavy gauge wire, looks to be tedious. I was hoping they would all just fit.
B000OQHRZ6|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B000H6W42Y|3|are hard to use and do not work well on lines that are in place for a long time.
B007ED84XG|5|The quality is great much better than photo's. The delivery came earlier in a well protected package. I ordered it as a gift for new car of my friend, cant wait to see it on :)
B0042Z0XWY|5|Nice looking!
B001D9E41I|5|We bought this larger product to cover a vent with a handle and another to cover the door window.  We have had one SunShield covering the back vent over the queen bed for 6 years with none of the issues reported by others.  We attached it to an Airstream's aluminum ceiling after cleaning the spots with alcohol.  Tabs have held up through storage in freezing and very hot conditions and in travels where outside temps were over 100 degrees.
B005IUP9LC|5|Seems to do the job. thats all I was asking for.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Does the job for the price you pay..... no complaints here.....
B009HCRMS0|5|Worked great, fit 2011 razor EPS 800.
B00Y1O2MIE|1|I can't speak to the quality of the product, because it didn't fit my standard plug. I ordered these bulbs, described as fitting size H8.  Be very careful.  The prongs on the GP Thunder were too far apart to fit the sockets on my automobile.  I had to return these bulbs, and instead buy standard Sylvania bulbs to fit the fog lights.  These bulbs were listed as H8, 35w bulbs, but make sure the prongs fit your sockets.  I was eager to add the look of a brighter, blue'r bulb to my fogs.  Make sure your plugs will accept prongs that are farther apart, more toward the outside of the assembly.
B000WJ87PY|4|Smells like plastic but that's because it is plastic. Other than that it's perfect. Fits my car and its working well. I think it's very comfortable
B004LF15QI|1|I like the product but when I go to register for the warranty they wouldn't take it on line. So you have no warranty!
B000C9P3E2|5|This OEM switch fixed the big oil leak my wife's Impala had. Be sure to purchase an oil pressure switch socket, or else you won't be able to get it off. There is a YouTube video that shows how the process is done, and it's quite simple, but you won't be able to see what you are doing. It was about a 5 minute job, and this high-quality switch should last a long time.
B00DVF81KW|5|Great deal & fit want, to buy another pair!
B001KQD7XA|5|It works like an OEM part. Great price. Easy to install.
B00KNMKRU8|4|It was great
B00M1XJV72|5|Does a great job of moving the window frame to get the lock out tool in and lets me do my job.
B00B9F1S1K|5|Just what I expexted, came exactly on time too
B003VZLJFG|3|It partially works but I guess it depends on how yellow the headlights are.
B001A4FKA0|4|This code reader saved my marriage.
B00DZKCXD4|5|Best $30 I've spent in a while. Easy to hook up and very bright on the front of my 1996 Jeep Cherokee. A great buy!!!
B00SVEHLW2|5|Great quality, fast shipping and lots of laughs. Just the right size.
B00B8YA66A|5|Purchased this for my 2005 Nissan Pathfinder. The OEM rear door shock had failed and decided to purchase this one. They work like a charm. They lift the rear door with very little effort and keeps the door open with no problem. The fit was perfect and the pressure was more then adequate to open the door. It was fairly easy to install. It would be harder to explain here then to do it in person as you need to see how the old ones are installed but i can tell you it was fairly simple to install. Had a friend of mine hold the door up while i removed and replaced the shocks. Took me less than 5 min to replace both of them.<br />  If your sick of holding your rear lifgate up then buy yourself a set of these. Its a great investment that will save you a lot of trouble in the future when loading/unloading stuff from your rear trunk.
B004MXN71U|5|Great!
B000C2G6UO|5|Decent part.
B007Y1DJDI|4|I received my torque wrench promptly and in good condition. I have never used a quarter inch torque and it's kind of small compared what I'm used to. The only problem I have with it is the case it comes in is about 8 inches longer than the torque wrench is. It appears they use the same case as the 3/8 drive torque wrench. It's only an issue if you have space constraints. All in all a great torque wrench
B000IYII4S|5|works
B00A6AS6LY|5|A+++
B00WFHVF1O|1|Didn't notice a difference,  feels like money down the drain.
B000VAXDHQ|1|The items in this pic us brake pads idk if I'd order this part till it's changed
B004GCU17K|5|Perfect match. Easy installation and prompt delivery to where I was going to be for a long weekend. VERY satisfied!!!
B004DPJFZE|5|Very nice mats
B000CNBNEC|5|Great brakes. If you are looking for street stopping grip, these are a good choice. Mileage; not so much. Dust; mucho!
B00DFMP8F2|2|The arm rest was smaller than the OEM. It's awkwardly made for the space, has no latch to close the arm rest. I regret purchasing this item.
B002UC30AS|4|Harder to put on than I expected. Never got all the bubbles out. Placed it on a slide out on our fifth wheel camper. The slide has been in and out several times with good results. With the exception of FL., the state stickers have fit well. Would recommend it.
B002JFQFNA|1|Not the same glasses
B00K8BN8QO|5|OEM Ford part was exactly what I expected. If you don't know what you're doing you absolutely need a professional technician to install.
B00171X63Y|5|Worked like it was put in from the factory.
B0016IA6XG|5|Solid unit. Easy Install. Many practical applications
B00KWLL268|5|Nice product and good shipping, is what I expect... Thanks.
B000TYSB8K|5|Just as advertised, Thanks!!!
B008H9H0V8|5|Works perfectly, good fit
B00BI1EVSW|5|Replacement for what we had perfect. Fast delivery
B002SSMGCW|4|Mostly what I expected when it was ordered.  Two problems occurred:  [1] I was having a hard time hooking up the existing hoses, and discovered that the heater had been manufactured crooked, so that the face, when fastened to the outside of the travel trailer and straight with it, was not in alignment with the rear, by about 1 1/2 &#34; to the right side, which made the water line hookup interesting, and [2]  only after installing and testing the water heater did I discover that I had no control over the temperature of the hot water.  This was in small print within the installation manual.  The actual heater worked first time, made temperature, and turned off.  Further testing found that it also turned on when the internal temperature lowered by use, both of these being good things.
B0081S4DCE|5|Arrived on time and in good condition. Was fairly easy to install, even by me, a totally un-mechanically inclined person. Very nice upgrade to my '09 Subaru Forester.
B00LLNXTWG|1|Not water proof, doesn't fit well
B00230E7KY|5|Easy to put on and nice clean shifts
B00KTIF652|1|Didn't work at all
B00FEZM8YW|4|Nice looking, stays on and gives the tailpipe an upgraded look.  Not factory so not sure how long it will keep it color.
B00PB4G676|1|won't fit
B000WK8XEI|4|Working fine so far
B00SEKQOWQ|5|Cheaply made. Looked nothing like the ad. Do not buy from this seller
B00KAPYM1I|5|Look and work great.  Not sure about long term durability yet, but they seem to be mounted solidly to the lights.
B005ESDBT0|5|Working
B004BF8UAC|5|Bought because I don't trust Them stupid car idiot lights, I want to know if battery is getting to much power Excessive power to battery is just as bad cause battery to boil and lose battery fluid which is corrosive will burn and is toxic.,
B000H2BPMS|5|This is my second pair of these headlights. The first pair I bought was in December of 2011. Incredible life out of these bulbs and I'm very satisfied with the light output.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Great product works as it's supposed to
B00B2E6LE2|5|No shedding keeps my hands cool in the blistering 100+ degree vegas heat.
B00XUPZ9Z8|1|As far as I know, I did good prep work on the car mat carpet.  The dye wore off in the heavy use areas.
B000COBANA|5|good quality
B00BSZ0Z5G|5|Perfect fast shipping,will be doing another order when km ready for another oil change.
B000BRGAJ2|4|All of the Royal Purple brand products are top of the line stuff.  I don’t really have the equipment to test it this really cools my car down better or not but I can say that it was packed well, sealed cap, and sent in a sealed plastic bag in case it was damaged.  My engine is running fine and I took it on a 12 hour drive to NC Outer banks with no issues or overheating in 80 to 90 degree temps.  I would definitely purchase this again.
B00MFB7R94|5|Product worked great for mounting extra driving lights on the grill guard of my Jeep. Good quality and great price.
B008I7P64M|5|The reflection is a bit distorted compared to the OEM glass, but for the price it is better than driving with a broken mirror.
B005GL8Y9W|1|Didn't fit the car
B00470RA66|3|Solid
B001JPB5UY|4|GOOD FILTER  SAVED ME MONEY
B000AMAE1S|5|Worked great...
B00ESD93CQ|5|The system is very easy to mount and the auto set up for high and low alarms is easy to activate.  I am very happy with my purchase.
B00H5F2G00|5|These look a lot better than the green caps that the manufacturer put on.  These are well made, light weight and look great.
B004RCOY5O|5|Just what I needed.
B0031BORGS|5|This charging system is great!!!
B0001EW01W|1|Not made to fit a 97 crv even if it stated on the package that it did.
B0068EQAAQ|5|good deal
B00LCBJBMY|5|Great
B0131GOKJQ|5|I will state that this trash can is incredibly tiny.  But it fits perfectly in a cup holder and I would use this trash can more so to throw away cigarettes, gum wrappers and/or straw wrappers.  Anything else would be too big for this sized trash can.  Nonetheless it is a sturdy thick plastic and has a spring type lid.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B0010GG7YG|5|Got this part about 10 min ago and took less than 5 to install it. Works and fits perfectly.
B00SH6FCUW|5|So sturdy.  We ordered them for both of our Jeeps and also for a friend recovering from Heart Surgery.
B000Q6QUV6|5|Quality item for its intended purpose at a great price.
B00Y5LJ4PC|5|Cccc
B00AGKJ6N6|5|Fast delivery , no problems and quality of items is good and sturdy metal. Love it .
B010TE15PK|5|This a very nice sunshade.
B002ZRQ4A6|5|Fit perfectly, easy install, very satisfied!
B00KC9HIG8|5|I hope I never need to use them, but I feel more safe with it in my car.
B0095TC6I6|5|Great product, worth the premium price.  Extended mirrors were sturdy and easy to adjust.  Worked well for 2,200 boat tow at speeds.  Mounts are adjustable to most mirrors.
B000IYHENE|5|Easy install, quick shipping.
B003EOJJ4W|5|Fits perfectly
B00ZKMIU2I|5|This is a combination cable helmet lock and I requested a pre-launch sample to test. The combination is very easy to set and took me about 30 seconds. The carabiner opens out which is very cool, other similar locks that I have seen open inwards and so can be a bit cramped to use and release the cable.<br /><br />When the lock is open you can simply release one end of the cable and feed it through the helmet and then secure it to your motorcycle, it's very easy to use and you can attach it to various part of your motorcycle.<br /><br />And the cable is long - just under 6 feet so is plenty long enough for an extra helmet so I can attach my partners helmet as well as my own.<br /><br />The entire lock / cable is black and is coated in plastic (the cable) or rubber (the actual lock) which means that it won't scratch either your machine or your helmet. It might also be waterproof but I have not yet tested it in the rain, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't.<br /><br />In summary it looks good, it's lightweight and it's easy to use. Highly recommended.
B0073WEZU4|5|Excellent.  Used a different brand on my other truck and it was ok but not to the quality / standard of this one.  Perfect fit and easy to install (just screw it in).  Recommend.
B004A0RACM|5|works very well
B0024E6V30|5|Awesome Product !!!
B000MIT5VA|4|This is a great sound bar. It was even better when I replaced the stock front speakers with Kickers. Not sure it they were hampering the amps or what, but everything sounded so much better after that. The only issue was that it did not come with the same plug as my stock 2002 Jeep Wrangler Apex. I had to cut the plug off and splice the wires in. The lights are very dim. Sure we something could be done about that.
B000CGVQ8C|5|Ordered these for a 2000 Monte Carlo. Look great and work even better. Do give a whirring sound when you drive but you can only hear it with your windows down and without any other cars around. I like the sound but it may bother some. Easy to clean also.
B0087XOTWW|4|I replace 16 regular bulbs in my camper with these LEDs. The whiter light is much better for reading and seeing clearly. They also draw so little electricity that our converter fan now never comes on to cool itself even when all the lights areally on. Before, turning on four lights at a time would cause the converter  fan to start up. I might change a few of the bulbs for the next brighter ones in those fixtures near where we do the most reading.
B004TCAFDC|4|Good quality. Fit perfect
B0044U1CGS|5|Love these and came quickly!
B008NO5QDQ|2|This product was fairly easy to install and fits well. That said, it has had no measurable effect on my fuel economy in the month or so I have had it installed. The only thing it does do is make a bit of a whistling noise when I'm accelerating. Upon consideration, the entire premise for this product doesn't make any sense. The product claims to improve fuel atomization and mix, but the Vortec engine on which it is installed is a direct-injection system, which is to say the air and gas do not mix in the intake manifold as it would on a TBI or carbureted engine. The only way this thing is going to improve torque or anything else is via the increase in plenum volume it creates, which is only going to be a few cc's. I would take it off and get a refund, except I've got better things to do and it's not hurting anything. You're better off spending this money on a better air filter or spark plugs to improve performance or fuel economy.
B0000DYVN9|5|Works great! love the 30-45 minute auto shut off.. I put mine just over the top of the top bed sheet put 3 more blanket ontop... works awsome..
B00BFDHBFS|5|Awesome product with fast shipping thank you
B005JU5W54|5|had them on a month...so far no squawking.
B001OCTKEA|4|I like it.  Has plenty of room, a way to lock it, and it installed easy enough on my hitch tongue.  I see no reason why it would not be water proof unlike some of the other comments.  Sure, if you open it in the rain or snow it will get inside.  Lid left closed, good to go.  Its crap you can sit or stand on it.  Maybe one time.  Not designed for that.  Bring a stool.  My fear is the intense northern california sun is going to eat it alive.  I give it 3-5 years max if exposed to the weather 24-7-365.  Let it bake in the sun a couple summers and then try sitting on it....<br />All in all, for what it is, its great.
B00NWGZ3A6|5|A good unit for a decent price. I would buy another one without hesitation if the need arose.
B00666KSE0|5|Fit like it was made for it, it was chrome over plastic.
B000Z9BMB2|5|Fit my Yamaha motorcycle perfectly.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Good product ry
B00NI6U6UM|5|It was exactly what I needed and what they said the Part # was and so far this part is working great thank goodness, it  is Very Hot in South Carolina!  Thank you Parts Square and AMAZON!!
B00VMXDK92|1|The fender flares went straight to the body shop and has them painted the same color as the truck. Then they called and I dropped off the truck to have them install them. Well when I picked them up the owner told me that some didn't fit up next to the truck, he is correct the rear ones have gaps and don't look good at all. I hope if it sits in the sun it might make them lay down next to the body of the truck. If not I'll replace them with bushwhacker ones. Not happy at all how they install.
B00VWT4WO8|5|Good product.
B008ETMV8I|5|Great straps and I love the way they loop through themselves giving way more strapping options.
B000VB4WAM|4|Great price,everything lined up..so far so good..been over 30 days...cold ac
B00X43GXMO|5|Great Quality and Fast Shipping!!
B0031I86JU|5|These installed easily, and solved my rattle problem.<br />The hard part was getting the old ones off, but some WD40 and some grunting and groaning got the job done.
B000M5YZBI|4|Useful dead blow hammer set but three hammers is a bit of overkill.  Two sizes, large and small, would have been sufficiently versatile.  Otherwise, the hammers themselves are perfectly adequate for the intended uses.  The plastic coating is reasonably durable but can be damaged by pounding on sharp metal edges, etc.
B002XM3IP2|4|This unit only works with other SHURFO products, which is perfectly understandable.  Had to modify another pump to have the twist on input make a watertight seal.
B001OBTL04|5|Everything I wanted and much more!
B00CAKILAO|5|Great mat!
B006DWYDZC|5|I have installed this tensioner on a 2006 4-cyl Dodge Caravan.<br />I was aware that Amazon does not recognize that part as a fit for the car, but I bought it based on the application catalog on Veyance website<br />I have inspected the tensioner against the original from the car, and it is identical. There is also an advantage to it, which is a 3/8&#34; square female drive, making it much easier to retract using a 3/8&#34; square drive than using an open wrench on the 14 mm tab at the end of the lever.<br />I could say also that the tensioning force it provided was identical to that of the original part.<br />All in all, this part fits perfectly the Dodge Caravan 2006 4-cylinder engine,
B007Y86BU4|5|Been driving about a week with this in my car, so far it's been working great.
B0093207XQ|5|Just right to cover and haul my XL883L Super Low.
B003TO7NRW|5|Good book
B00121BPI2|5|I purchased this product through the prodding of a friend. I read all the reviews I could find.  I watched a number of tutorials that were at the company website and at YouTube.<br />I am very happy to say that I am pleased with the results. I washed the car first.  Put the first application and let it dry.  Washed that off and dried the car. Then proceeded to use the product. As they instructions recommend, only do a small sections at a time.  It dries fast enough and wipes off better than any other wax that I have used.<br />Even if it doesn't last five years, I would do it again in a year.  I will buy the companion products for washing and yearly tweaking of the shine.  That way I will see if it last five years.<br /><br />Just make sure your car is very clean before you start the process.  It does take about four hours. I had enough to do a full size car with a little extra.
B002T49LH8|5|Perfect for in the car
B00UIO4DI8|4|fits perfectly. thanks.
B002H9CMCQ|4|My favorite to keep the underside and wheel wells protected.<br />Sticks good and dries fast. No mess unless you're a drunk.<br />Well, if the baby is crying and the dog is barking and the phone is ringing , I guess you could botch the job sober.<br />Too many variables but generally its simple without incident.<br />Best I've used.
B0066CP786|4|Noisy.On Off switch is hit or miss but puts out plenty of air.
B008QDWGN2|5|As described
B00407YPPK|5|Works/blends well on my '95 Jeep YJ (Wrangler). Bed-lined the floor boards and then sprayed this over the top - NICE, blends right in. Also painted diamond plate pieces with it, looks original (be sure to scrub/prep those extra well, or they will peel).
B0002V9IFU|5|Smells so good and looks so clean I could lick my seats now
B0009Z840O|4|Liked it very much
B00QN8WGNC|4|Very nice product.
B00E1SMC12|5|Fits like a glove came ready to install and so far so good on quality I will buy again thanks for awesomely fast shipping and a great product.
B005NLQAHS|5|Worked as expected!
B008O9DV78|5|I bought this instead of buying a holding tank flush kit that you install by drilling a hole in your holding tank. My new motorhome does not have a window in the bathroom and I wasn't going to try to drag a hose through the living area. I installed this and can fill either tank up to rinse multiple times if needed. Very happy with this purchase.
B00ONH4VV0|5|Unit did not come with the update harness connector.
B005OXVO5S|5|Fit and works great. I used the shortest nut driver I could find to remove the screws. Was easier than trying to use a 1/4 inch drive socket.
B00N8063LO|5|Top quality product! The fit and finish is spot on.<br />I have purchased other products from this company for my other vehicles. Floor mats and tray liners. Quality! Quality! Quality! With every penny you spend no one else comes close.
B00NFFPUKC|4|Key chain I like, the valve stem caps, well, they don't over the valves stem
B00009K762|5|works great
B005VLXP14|5|Worked great
B003904GHG|5|Good quality for the price.
B010C5709Q|1|DO NOT GET THIS if you own a 2013 Hyundai Accent. The mirror width is completely off. It says it fits but unfortunately it doesnt.
B004YA2726|4|beautiful I llike it.
B00VB2OG9W|5|Great value! Fits well.
B00YNF8SSE|3|Tip to Tip it is in fact 1 ft.  The wire between the two plugs is only 9.5 inches.  I was hoping for 12 inches of wire and then the plugs on the end.  It will work, but not a long as I anticipated.
B00KTJ0BHY|4|These worked perfect for my needs..they are more difficult to program than the instructions claim but it only cost me 20 dollars to have it programed..I am a satisfied customer..
B001FZNIL2|3|This tailgate net is very good for the price,it fit my Toyota Tacoma perfect, easy to install, took me about 15 minutes after taking off my tailgate!  But I wanted it tight on my truck,so I pulled it as tight as I could get it and the strap riped, Do NOT OVER TIGHTEN this gate,just get it snug, I got a needle and thread and put it back together,it has been just fine after that!  It's still on snug and hasn't moved at all, so for the price,it is awesome!
B004LX3AS6|5|Now this is a great product came two day before it was due and works great easy to store and two kinds of hook ups buy this
B00APOALHS|5|No problem. Item sent right on time. Will definitely try them again..
B00IGIZ9NG|5|Very nice license plate. Nice bright colors.
B0016C3STQ|1|Wrong
B00X8JPJCE|5|Well built
B000HM99EE|3|The product was OK in lines for its look, but they did not come close to fitting my Chevy Silverado as they claim they should.  I had huge gaps all around the top rail, and they supplied spacers that they said should be used to take up space.  Not a thing I want to do to a vehicle where a custom fit was needed.
B00EFFY6BK|5|Excellent stuff at removing stains from aggregate finish concrete!  Completely removed an oil stain from my driveway.
B006HD1GCK|5|Great fit factory part
B0002SQUVI|4|Works fine, but does have a small ding from shipping on the edge that matters (good thing the ding is on the end).
B001CC6N8I|5|I purchased one for each family member's car or truck.  When you see in the news about children or pets trapped in cars, or a child needing to be quickly released from a car seat in an emergency, this tool makes me feel more confident that I can be of help in a bad situation.  I keep it right next to the driver's seat in my vehicle.
B006VJO61I|1|Cannot be used in a vehicle with a manual transmission as the design does not allow it to fit behind the shifter boot. Even if you do managed to get it to snap in place, which I did, it will not allow you to shift into 3rd gear.<br /><br />It would have been nice if this information was specified in the part description.
B00KQSLKKK|5|way worth the money!!I lost my keys and this was a cheap way to replace it!!
B000IYSYO2|5|Great product A+++
B00JLJRE4G|5|Works well on my 2005 Ford Taurus. Vulcan Engine.
B001UCD4NW|1|didn't fit my vechile is for v6
B00WV7ZP3M|5|The light arrived quickly from California, and was unblemished in the box. The end of box had split open a bit however, and some of the nuts had spilled out. No worries, I had to go and get stainless steel hardware anyway. This thing installed like a dream using the Omotor brackets shown in the photo, which I also got here on Amazon. In fact, the brackets cost as much as the light! This thing does not have Cree LEDs, because the LEDs in this light are circular, while all Cree LEDs are square. But for 80 bucks I wasn't expecting Cree LEDs, notwithstanding the title of the product. They are plenty bright, and they look just as cool as as the Rigid. The only thing I haven't tested is the waterproofing. I will come and update this review once I drive through the pouring rain at 70 miles an hour and report whether there are puddles in the light. Oh, one more thing: it doesn't whistle at high speed, which I have read is a problem with other light bars. Perhaps it's just where you mount it, not the bar itself, but this bar and my mounting brackets equals no whistle. So far, so good.
B00INTTIK8|1|Needed a small litter bag, so I found the Bell bag on line.  The size stated on line was 8.6&#34; H x 4.1&#34; W x 2.3 D.  The bag I received was very large. The stated size on the box was 12&#34;H x 9&#34;W x 4&#34;D. The bag would have been exactly what I needed except it to large for the location I need it for.  Sent it back (Amazon) and will try to find another smaller bag.
B000COCTXA|2|too much work to install and no directions come with it.
B0066COXY0|5|After buying a Koolatron 12v cooler and its matching 12v converter, I quickly learned the converter that goes with the cooler was noisy and overheating to the point I couldn't even touch it. I decided I wasn't going to wait until it melted and burned the house or hotel room down so I sent it back and replaced it with this Schumacher unit. On a recent 3 week road trip, it performed quietly and with next to no heat. I highly recommend this unit to power a 12v cooler, over any of the tiny ones w/o fans.
B000C9C84K|1|Amazon web site says it fits 2000 chevy silverado 1500 v6 but it does not.<br /> It is smaller than the original gm part.
B00GHGGYYM|5|Excellent fit for my 2007 M109R. Purchased for when I ride with a passenger. Go for it!
B001P2HMQM|5|Best thing I have bought for the car since I purchased it. Easy to install and fit great plus look nice on the car.<br />Dean<br />Waterloo, IL
B00MMKPK0G|1|Too big.
B0007LVJ2A|5|Worked great. Just sprayed with wd 40 to prevent rust.
B0070YM43A|5|This is great! Better than advertised. I bought it for my wife's Mini Cooper S and it installed as easily as it said in the directions. Even works with the sunroof retracted.
B00AZW30M8|5|Arrived on time and my son loved it!
B002ECL0TW|5|Came quickly and was just what I wanted.
B001EP28XW|5|As advertised!
B00EJY85XW|5|Great product. Came as expected and looks perfect.
B00QF0NI3A|5|Exactly as expected and described.
B00TZ5Y67O|5|Good buy
B00DY6FMMI|5|Have had this for about four days and have really liked it. Able to have the freedom tops off even with the temps in the 90s. Have noticed a difference on the temp on the middle console and the steering wheel along with the glare being reduced greatly.<br /><br />Able to install and leave on even when the freedom tops are in place, sites not interfere with them at all.
B001CA8W6Q|4|This is an OEM replacement for a 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 Hemi. It is identical to the original part. Only reason I can not give it 5 stars is because Dorman should have made modifications to the poor design of having the a/c cooling lines go through the plastic housing.  As a result a straight cut through that plastic area, which is not structurally needed, makes install very simple with not having to discharge and remove the lines and then reinstall the lines and recharge the a/c system.  In other words this DIY repair with some minor tweaking was a huge money saver.  The battery and fuse box did not need to be taken out. With some patience you can easily work the fan assembly out and the new one in place in between the radiator hose and fuse box housing.  After this 90 minute repair my a/c is now operating like new again.
B008DQV88Q|5|If you have a Jeep jk '07-'15 this should be your first upgrade with bulbs!! Next move on to a wire harness. You will put a lot on light on the road.
B00SLKQHXK|5|work good easy to put on
B00P8897SK|5|Still can't believe it. These mats are identical for less than 1/3 the dealer price
B00NPZSD38|5|These are the plugs you want if you have a 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2.0T and are the exact match of the OEM part.
B0006FKFMC|4|Worked OK but didn't get the bigger dings out
B00FBKSDDA|1|They look like stock light i think the stock lights light up more
B0031I5Z6M|3|AC delco made in china !!!! not good
B007J0V7MO|1|The led barely work...has 13 less per bulb and only 2 on 1 work none on the other....
B000C5DUN2|5|Parts were new and are identical to the original parts on my 2000 Ford Ranger....easy to install and a perfect form, fit, and function.  Well priced.
B00PSRORH2|2|Design is beautiful for sure BUT do not be deceived. It does not provide the adequate sun protection I was hoping. Leaving the looks aside, it does a very poor job. Sadly. It was good enough for Spring time but for California's Summer weather, it's terrible. I had to buy another shade a month later that actually prevented the sun from reaching my baby.
B000IZ3K4U|1|Lasted 2 weeks and it blew out.. The old one still works so I had to put it back in... I only replaced because it started to smell like burning I thought replacing it would help instead it left me with a dead A/C until I out the old one back in now my A/C works again... Wasted money...
B00J5EYRUQ|1|Too thick for a car neck pillow.
B00RU9QV7K|3|I was really excited to find the complete mat set for such a cheap price. Its really heavy duty, I like that. However I was a bit bummed that the trunk mat didn't fit my Camry as advertised. But for the price I used a little creativity a made it work. Wish it was available in other colors.
B0006307GI|5|Thanks for the product
B002RSIK4G|5|Love this stuff!!
B00F3XBX46|4|worked on kawasaki VN800. spring and washer were too large, however.
B0094X3XW6|5|Fast shipping and just how advertised.
B003178XE4|5|easy to put on sound really good
B007FF5VAC|4|Have not used. Programed fine. Spare fob. Found keys LOL
B000F3IKDG|5|I bought these pistons for my d16z6 bottom end. I have not assembled the motor yet but the Pistons look amazing! You are definitely getting what you pay for. I'm only gonna be pushing 300 or so who but they will definitely last longer than the vitara pistons. I'll update when I get the car running with boost.
B00HUHY47Q|5|Wrote to wrong person but love this one
B001V8UKBY|2|One star for a good idea and one star for good construction, but minus three stars for failure in execution. The ramp raised the axle enough to get the flat tire off, but not high enough to put the inflated spare on. About 1&#34; too low. The wheels on my trailer are close together. I had to deflate the spare and re-inflate after mounting. If you carry a compressor, this just adds some time to the job (not that you wish to add any time while on the shoulder of an Interstate highway). If you don't have a compressor, you are out of luck. If you buy this, make sure you try it out before you need it. Or have a Plan B (i.e., carry a jack).
B00871CJ1W|1|complete junk on windows 7. Save your money because you can not return item. Listed as new but no way in hell it was new. Will not even let you instal driver and will not recognize when you plug into usb
B00B8W06R6|1|The co. that make the front seat cover , this is the 2nt cover and the seam that connects the top to the bottom is pulling apart please do some thing about this. the seat  cover is not easy to change out.
B00H1ES6S6|5|love these and they are a great deal
B0064R7XRQ|5|Very high quality.
B00EG283BQ|5|A+
B003G0KX7G|5|Item fits well in the back of my CC with subwoofer. Had a nice cut-out to accommodate the sub enclosure under the drivers side seat, i don't think the Weathertech accounts for the factory sub enclosure in my truck.  Seems like it could be made to be thicker and more rigid, but overall it fits excellently and thoroughly covers the floor. I went with husky in the back and Weathertech in the front because of what I read on the owners forum about fitment.  Good combination.  Have yet to test the functionality of the mats as its summer time.  Should do great in the snow from what I can tell. I'll find out once I move to Colorado and will update then.
B0093ISJ30|4|Works fine but bulb has plastic base that connects to aluminum square piece versus all aluminum Philips or Sylvania, needless to say I broke one handling it a bit too rough but at $10 per bulb not really upset
B000XBHE82|4|Met expectations.
B011PCW7W0|5|It fits
B000BGM8D0|5|Good price, easy to install, and very hardy
B001B0VCBE|4|has held up nice and work good
B0045V8CKU|5|easy to install .. quality product
B00PUH1SCW|5|Excellent product. Note: requires drilling (or cutting) a small hole into the front passenger-side fog light cover so that the tow bolt can be accessed.
B000KL1HVK|4|works good
B0034ND4JO|1|Not what I thought it would be. Wanted to send it back because I was disappointed but I would have spent more on shipping than I did on the purchase of the helmet. Gave me a huge mushroom head look. Extremely unattractive. Not the style I was hoping for.
B006CSUQQW|4|Good item it will be great if will bring the steering wheel controls cables
B009Y7MJVS|4|works good
B0035AMPFK|5|Great value for the price!
B004GEYCAK|5|Fits  perfectly -- installed in about 5 minutes
B009DIW40Y|5|Fast shipping, Fantastic product, fit perfectly... Will recommend company and product...
B008IFYP1Y|5|excellent
B00P2D3VZG|5|Good quality, bright lights, fit perfectly.
B000C8T86M|5|I love this filter kit.  The replacement reinforced gasket alone is worth the price compared to other kits.  Kits at parts stores have a simple rubber gasket that has two problems;  They are more prone to possible leakage (especially if they are cork), and they are difficult to torque to spec because they stress the holes in the pan without a reinforced gasket.<br /><br />Buy this if you are seeking a quality alternative to the OEM hardware.<br /><br />Additional note:  The original gasket is supposed to be reusable but I prefer to replace each time.
B00KWQRC4O|4|It's great ...just the trash compartment is very shallow....i still like it because it keeps most of my kids trash off the floor..
B000C32M7Y|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B000COTKDM|5|Works great
B003271CLE|5|These mats are very excellent in quality,  however, just make sure that when ordering,  that you speak with someone, as to the color.
B00X6FQ7Q2|4|they are good so far, used for like two month and are like OEM.
B00QF5ZLS0|5|What I was looking for.  Pleased.
B0022ZV1KE|5|Fit perfectly, awesome delivery!
B007H2Q01M|5|Excellent gravity chair! Very nicely made and extremely comfy. I got the Wide recliner and would recommend this over the skinnier one. It's so much bigger and more comfortable. Definitely worth the money!
B004APM12G|5|it work as described
B00N9S9MM2|5|Follow product directions and it will make an old seat look new and clean.  I bought a 2008 Volvo that needed some TLC and detailing.<br />I had a terrible looking dirt stain on the driver's side of the Volvo.  I used this spray, first on a rag to wipe in a base coat, then sprayed the finish, and you cannot tell the stain was ever there.<br />Make sure you mask around the leather you are treating, and don't overspray.  Use several coats instead.<br />This stuff added hundreds of dollars back to the value of the car.
B00P2D4C36|5|Very good replacement bulbs, crisp, clean, bright white light.  Replaced Volvo S80 low beams using the Philips H11 Vision bulbs. Good idea to buy the 2 bulb pack, to replace both at the same time.  Easy plug and play install.
B00QQUV3QI|5|Fit great in my 2010 hyundai elantra
B000CB0KDO|1|I don't know if the length was wrong but the belt squeeled. I did change the tensioner. I then bought one 10mm shorter and it fixed the problem.
B000ZN03QI|5|The fuel pump for my mercury grand marquis was a perfect fit, and I saved over $200.00 shopping with amazon. I would recommend anyone to try amazon for all of your car part's and accessories.
B00ULNY60Q|5|They made my car looks more sporty!!!
B009DS1BV2|5|SMOOTH PURCHASE PLEASE AND THANK-YOU!
B00VNBEBCS|2|I bought these for a 2008 Ford Focus because the OEM bulbs really are hard to see at night.  They were VERY difficult to install in this model and took quite some time.  These bulbs are fairly bright, but are noisy (I can actually hear them while sitting in the drivers seat) and the high beams stink.  The high beams don't project any further down the road, they're just brighter off to the sides.  I live out in the country and I had a terrible time using these while testing them down some dark country roads.<br /><br />Also, these bulbs arrived in a plain envelope, not a box.  The box containing the bulbs was badly dented, but the bulbs seemed to be OK since they were LEDs, not glass bulbs.  I also purchased these off of Newegg.com, not Amazon because they were back-ordered.
B001G8AIMU|4|worked very well....charged my battery over night,,,,saved me money by not having to buy a new battery.
B00HZ0E8P6|5|Delivered on time & performs without any difficulties.  Charging time cut down dramatically
B003AVQQTA|4|This product is great, however the tie rod end boot is not the right size. It looks more like it matches the ball joint. Unfortunately I trusted the packaging label and I already cut off my tie rod end boot.<br /><br />Frustrating, but all the other parts seem to be in order. I'd give it five stars if all the parts matched up.
B0049Z6TC0|5|This is a must for infiniti owners, size is perfect and looks great with keys. Shipping was fast.
B00AQIL05A|5|Perfect
B002XYZYBG|5|I am satisfied.
B00CAKILAO|3|It is oversized, however it is meant to be trimmed to fit. The manufactured odor smell as many reviews I have read were accurate. The smell is very pungent and lingers. Other than that it is useful and does the job.
B000CP8FF0|3|Didn't fit snuggly. Had to hammer it in place and ended up leaving a bolt out because the holes didn't line up.
B00J8D5SF2|2|Purchased for my 2014 Silverado with bench seat. The back of the seats and console fit fine. But, the actual seat (part you sit on) doesn't attach securely. The instruction say to feed the securing straps under the seat and pull tight. But, the seat has a large sensor that prevents the strap running from under the seat unless your willing to have it pinch the sensor. Additionally, the cover has a strap that looks like it should run from side to side but it isn't mentioned in the instructions or shown on the you tube video instructions. If you do feed it under the seat, it hits the same sensor.<br /><br />The seat portion of the center console only has two small Velcro ends that are suppose to attach to the front and back of the console. It isn't enough to hold it in place. I wound up removing it and putting a towel over that area.<br /><br />The material and stitching are high quality. Just does fit very well
B00WID0OEE|4|The squeegee works fine and it came with 2 replacement blades. If the handle was longer I would have graded the squeegee a 5 instead of 4.
B00CGTGO1M|5|Installed just like the instructions said.  Nice quality hitch and looks factory installed on my CX-9.  Wiring was a little more work as you have to rune a power wire from the back of the car directly to the battery.  Lights work great.  You can install this hitch by yourself in less than an hour, including the wiring.
B00QSLYYGG|4|Awsome n looks great. EASY TO PUT ON
B0014JUHA4|5|Fast shipping I will buy again
B00GGZ8U5A|5|This is a great light and the company selling them is top notch. I had a small issue and they handled it instantly.  Great!
B007EERHYM|5|Being a V'nam veteran, I have received many compliments on style and colors and a few &#34;Thank You for your service&#34; after over 40 years passage. Time does heal wounds!
B00LEUOKLA|5|Look great.  Easy to mount.  Excellent price and service.  Needed to replace the aftermarket bags on my '96 Magna.  These are the absolute best alternative I could find.  Nothing bad to say.  All positive.
B00CMXCJLQ|4|I returned it for credit, two lights were out
B000C9C1YW|5|OEM is the only way to go when it comes to compressors!! Most aftermarket compressors are junk and will last a year at most. Do yourself a favor and buy the real parts when it comes to A/C stuff.
B00D49Z1NA|5|Absolutely love this sticker! I've gotten many compliments on it from my SOA friends!
B00UZE8C1A|5|worked great although lost a few bristles
B00SH1SN6C|5|[[VIDEOID:f91863fd0025ed7db51133fea1c663]] A friend of mine told me about this product a few months ago after I had to deal with a dead battery.  I was skeptical that something so small would turn over a car engine, so I went out and bought a larger jump starter pack.  That unit includes a compressor, so it's larger than I'd like, taking up a lot of room in the back of my SUV.  Then my friend surprised me a couple of days ago by giving me one of these RAVPower units.<br /><br />Last night, while out playing a gig, I left my car lights on and drained the battery.  There was enough juice in the car's battery to light up the dash board, but the engine wouldn't turn over.  The RAVPower was still in the shrink wrap on the front seat - I didn't have a chance to take it inside to check it out or charge it up, so was worried if it had an ample charge from the factory.  I decided to give it a try any way.  Cut through the shrink wrap, clipped the alligator clips to the battery and plugged the other end of the cable into the RAVPower unit (all without reading the instructions) and started the car right up.  My 2006 Acura MDX fired up quickly - no slow turn over like I've experienced with other jump starter packs.<br /><br />With my bandmates huddled around my car all amazed as I was that such a tiny thing could start up my car, I think RAVPower has at least four more customers in the near future.  That it doubles as a USB battery bank to charge small electronics like iPhone and iPads is just icing on the cake.  I don't think I'll use this one as such - I want to make sure it's always in the car in case I need it - but I'm tempted to buy a couple to have on hand for other emergencies.  It's hurricane season now in Hawaii.  I'm certainly going to make sure there's one of these in each of my immediate family member's car.<br /><br />I did read the instructions when I got home - happy that I actually got the operation of the unit correct by intuition.  I just plugged in one of our iPads (original Retina, which is something of a power hog), so jury is still out on that functionality, but I assume charging devices will be no problem for the RAVPower.  The attached video shows my iPad attached to the unit and going into charge mode.  Pretty simple, really.  Wish I caught some video of the unit being used to jump my car last night, but with a flash flood advisory in effect for the area, I was in a bit of a rush to get the car started.<br /><br />I owe my friend a huge thanks for this timely gift.
B000701HF0|5|Works good - Thanks
B000XECJES|5|Use every day.  Easy care.  Great product.
B00TXQVEIO|5|We all have goals!
B0074UTQI6|5|Perfect
B00CJUW3HW|5|It is what it is
B00BJ4EF0C|5|Fast and no worries. A reused cap but all new parts where it matters
B00JVVCHAU|5|Great look and style. Ive recieved so many compliments on it.
B000QDHENM|5|I have just filled my cans so I will know more when I empty them into my lawn mower.
B00JBHY0PO|4|So far, the seat covers fit very nice and are very pretty. The only problem I have is the headrest covers are too big and I haven't tried the rear seat cover yet. In due time, I will sew the headrest covers so that they too will fit. Thank you so much for such a nice product.
B00BQ052X8|5|A must have!!
B000CMJANO|5|great styling and functionability
B0024E6V9E|5|One size does not fit all but, with ingenuity, it will .Pushed in side down enough to keep it from tipping over inside  an old 5 gallon paint bucket drilled two holes drilled out in and out lines on side wall of bucket with lid,and some Insulation wrap will keep from freezing and a easy carry from RV Site To Site take down.
B000KL8R5Y|4|Had to go to the hardware store for longer screws.  Very frustrating to install but once it's on you'll love it !
B003CYBMNA|5|Very nice car cover I should have gotten this long time ago, keep you car free od dust and dirt, nice soft texture to protect your paint. Worth every penny.
B00NGOVSF8|5|It came to us VERY quickly.  The install was very elementary and quick. Will purchase from this vendor again...
B005JU5TUM|5|As advertised, works well
B0043063JU|5|Very satified. The second season on a problem patio. Holds up well under the southwest sun.
B001O0VPBI|2|I installed these myself, but got brake noise; when I took the car to my mechanic, he said the pads were a bit too wide for this car and installed a completely new set.
B0077CSNGW|5|Has a strong smell, otherwise love it.
B000JLOXE4|3|After 2 months, I finally have a decent tune on the 1975 Porsche 914 1.8. The kit is ok, a lot of china here. PROS: Complete as pictured. Carbs are Weber. My highway mileage is 43mpg and street is 22-27mpg. (you can set either way better low or top ends, but the in-between is crap)CONS: Instructions specific to vehicle non-existent. Instructions with kit? One page and worthless, Period. You will need to fabricate a accel cable bracket. You will need fuel line and clamps/or balance hose. Using the stock distributor Mine is vacuum advance and retard. I ran the advance to the carb base  and currently have the retard open, but plan to t into balance hose. Hex tub linkage system not good at all. Far too many adjustments and moving parts. Springs on Weber for throttle close or return are far too weak to return gas pedal to idle.. The parts are there, you are on your own after that. You will spend a lot of time on the linkage. The intake manifolds are difficult to install the thickness at bolt holes make getting a socket on the fastener impossible on two of them had to grind a bit. Basically not a plug and play system, and intakes could be a bit taller. But the basics are there. Air filters are cheap, and you need to oil them .
B00DJ3N3SQ|5|Works, but ill be sure to be more precise for how long it does if it ever malfunctions
B00KC6LXSK|5|Fit great and arrived fast.
B00WA4ARO8|5|Nice tight fit<br />More pliable than other makes.<br />Easy to clean<br />Would buy again
B00JIGZXMC|5|These work great for the rear side markers on my 2016 WRX.  I orignally used white LEDs in there, but with the red housing the light output looked more orangy.  These red LEDs are the way to go.
B000MNN4WQ|2|Poorly designed S hooks.  More like a Z
B0049DNUTW|5|Great value vs retail bought.
B00WTSW02M|3|Everything works but the temperature doesn't work in the heat.  I had to tape the compass down because the &#34;stickem&#34; doesn't hold it up very well.  Also sometimes the top part gets loose and falls forward so it has to be kept tight with a screwdriver once in a while.  I really bought it for the actual compass part and that does work well.
B00PUTF8MQ|2|Assembled it good and the thing broke off the next day
B009SX0J88|5|works great
B004PX8BC2|5|Perfectly use.
B002SSBPQK|4|I read the other complaints about the hairs falling out, so I spent some time up front brushing out the loose hairs before using it on my convertible top. Minimal amounts of hair came out on the top. The little bit that did rinsed off easily.
B0055B121U|5|Perfect OEM fit.  Helped me clear my Check Engine Light.
B00B0DGRF8|5|So perfect!
B00JBICD8Y|5|Changed the look more than I thought it would. Would recommend.
B000FQ0W1G|5|product still working good as new.
B00NR9WVJ4|3|Not easy to put on you definitely have to know how to apply tint to be able to do it. I ruined the vinyls and had to throw them away.
B004A30UHG|5|Exactly what we needed at a great price and shipped quickly.
B00HFWZ1NW|4|Perfectly fit for Camry. Nice !!!
B000Z0HVHA|5|Seemed to work perfectly for what I wanted so Im very pleased.
B00MUAI7JO|4|These are OK, but found them to actually be too long for what I had intended to use, but they are bright.
B00JI5OA68|5|yes this was fit and look love it!!
B000DINKPQ|4|This is a great replacement for the wimpy OEM horns on motorcycles and scooters, even better than the horns on the old Volkswagen beetles.
B004OKP4WG|5|Actually the thin green line is for Security Officers, we're the unnoticed department sadly
B000KL2E1W|5|Good price and delivery thank you
B001UE04OM|5|Works great!
B0030BUP56|5|Solid!!!
B000CMDA1C|5|Nice nuts. LOL
B00H87CQUU|4|This did match the original pinion snubber on my 1968 Impala quite well with a couple of minor exceptions. First no hardware was included which would not be a big deal except that it is metric fine thread. The thread is M10 with 1.0mm thread pitch. No way was that factory original for the vehicles this is listed for but other than that the part looks and measures extremely close to the original. It is a part which assembles once and is never removed so I was ok with the strange thread but wish it were more common so options were more readily available.<br /><br />Second point is that the M10 thread is just slightly larger than one of the 2 holes where the snubber can be assembled at least on the 1968 Impala. I'm not certain why there are 2 positions but both frames I have do have 2 holes and the second is not used. They look the same but only 1 hole would accept the M10 and the other would need to be enlarged slightly. Again no big deal but I suspect the factory original is slightly smaller thread..<br /><br />Incidentally this part is listed on Amazon for the A-Body but the Parts Place does show other body styles with the same PN.If the alternative to finding metric thread was no listing at all I was very happy they chose to list the part.
B001C6N7BU|5|Awsome product works and fits perfectly mahalo, thank you
B000BM3B3A|4|It did what it was supposed to.
B00F4JOOG8|5|Smaller than what appears in picture but cool decal. I will probably just use the skulls and pitch the J and P. Price is pushing the bar on this one. Free shipping makes it worth while.
B00JA3BMDW|5|simple to use and accurate
B00ONGXNPG|5|This part came earlier than expected, it was well packaged, was free of damages, and fit well. Thanks
B00K71AZ5W|5|Love this APC. Use it for everything and smells great.
B00COYMPIK|5|items were exactly what were advertised.
B000N9LCH8|5|I installed this fuel pump on a 1976 9.9 Evinrude and it fits and works fine.
B00T6S94R2|5|Great kit... Makes installing a light bar so much faster, swapped the switch out though for a backlit rocker. The supplied switch is garbage.
B007ZU4JNC|5|good
B00CD6FL6M|5|Excellent product, good price, very happy.
B00IISLUOQ|5|Works perfectly.
B003E3OF9M|5|looks great
B002MY6ZZG|5|Absolute must if you have a synthetic cable. This prevents the winch clevis/hook from damaging the fairlead which can abrade your cable.
B002JBDH26|1|This part lasted approximately 5 uses before it broke again.  Poor quality of plastic used in manufacturing.
B002JOVUO0|2|Not as strong as claimed
B00LP7ZY9O|3|These pedals do look cool on your ML350, which is why I'm giving this a 3 star.  I just wish all the pedals fit!  The accelerator and brake pedals fit perfectly, but the EBrake DID NOT FIT AT ALL on a 2007 Mercedes ML350.  Also, one of the screws that holds the metal onto the rubber base on the brake pedal was stripped out and was very difficult for me to get out (though I did finally get it). And these were fairly pricy for what you get here, I would expect all pedals to fit perfectly.  Maybe I can modify the Ebrake pedal to work by drilling a hole in the car's pedal to secure the rubber base?  3 stars is probably better than this purchase deserves!
B000C2NOI6|5|both were great fit just right
B004JC19RI|5|Simply to apply, and I've had no problems with peeling. I highly recommend this type of decal to show off all your fandom interests. Shiny!
B00UD3Z3EW|5|Great!!!
B0009H52AW|5|The standard, used them for 45 years.
B00VEMKZAI|3|Decal is really nice. Got it for my car, but I would go with at least the 5 inch
B00UZ0OHIQ|2|I was primarily interested in using this to measure my car's average fuel economy based on the types of trips I was taking, but after using it for a little over a month and measuring it against the odometer and gas pump, its mpg estimates are over 15% off of actual.
B000MCXOZ4|3|Has to be on the zerk just right for grease to go in. If not positioned correctly it just makes a mess. A little frustrating in tight spots where visibility may not be the best.
B0035R3Q3S|5|Great Price fast shipping
B00U60MH3W|5|Looks great
B0002UNON8|2|I was told it could remove some paint from a minor collision, but it doesn't.
B013DXR3ZU|5|Very bright! Hardware is strong! Mounted on rear bumper and hooked to switch in the cab for hooking up trailers. Great deal already got them soaked and didn't leak at all.
B002J7VWWC|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B001BW8BCU|5|Very well built. I like the cover, gives it fit and finish. Had same one on boat for 10 years and use it every weekend, so it will last.
B003VCDI7G|5|perfect!
B00NHD026E|5|GREAT... easy to detail the bike and work on it. Bought the side extensions also, fits perfect! Love the whole set up!!!!
B00RVUFOUS|3|they look cool - strange shipment - comes directly from China in a non marked package … easy to install and they look good in my phantom black A7 …
B000VBCCKE|4|Pretty good. Doesn't quite have perfect fit like people say. There's some gaps between the edge and the carpeting. But it'll be a godsend come winter.
B00DBESE64|4|I have not had any problems with the lights.
B00TSV2XIO|5|Just perfect
B001TLITTI|1|Very low quality said it fits and didn't
B00HQSP96Y|5|This plate is awesome! Well made, and the appearance on the truck is great. I have LED license lamps on my 2016 Kenworth T680, that really make the plate stand out at night. It almost has a ghostly look. I added a chrome frame, a clear protector, and chrome bolt caps, and it really pops. This was a great addition to my new truck.
B0082GKQQW|3|Mats were good quality but did not fit my 2015 Hyundai Tucson.  They were cut to fit, but came too small to cover all areas of carpet as I was looking for.  I kept the floor mats and would buy again.  But if I was looking to cover the entire area of carpet, I would need to have it professionally done by WeatherTech.
B0023W17TQ|5|Exactly what we needed.  We used them to replace broken lights on our Infinity.  Took a little effort, but my husband and a friend of his replaced them over their lunch hour, so money well spent.  Saved us hundreds compared to going to Infinity dealership.
B0063MI65K|5|Fit great look amazing
B000CLMJR4|5|Matched up perfectly.  Ended up buying spring kit and brake adjuster kit as well on my 21yr old Ranger.  Take care: if Amazon says something fits your vehicle don't just accept that, as it is not always true.  I sent back a brake cable, a belt that was too short (did not differentiate between a/c [compressor] and non a/c belt length, and other items.  Try visuals and questions.
B00DBEOM56|1|These are terrible. They'll last maybe 2 months, before individual led's burn out and then eventually the entire thing will stop working.
B001PRX7WK|5|Works great. I had shoulder surgery and it really helps my turns while i am recovering.
B0010VO8PQ|4|These lights, all things considered, offer a great value. For less than a hundred bucks you get a complete kit with everything needed to mount them to just about any vehicle. There are, however, some pretty big issues that should be addressed.<br /><br />First, the relay and wiring harnesses are NOT suitable for anything but 55w halogens and even then, you're really pushing your luck. Ideally, for 55w bulbs, you would have 14AWG wires and for 100W-130W bulbs, 12AWG wires. I'm not sure what size comes with the kit, but they're definitely way too small. They're also not copper core wire; maybe zinc plated something or another? Regardless, they're not copper. If you do decide to use the included wiring, be VERY careful as it is quite fragile and the insulation tears easily.<br /><br />I had the best luck by throwing away all of the wires that came with the lights and running 12AWG wire directly from the battery and into the light and to the bulb. I also threw away the included relay and purchased a 30/40A 4 pin relay from RadioShack. Running 100W or even 130W halogen bulbs is no problem. The relay gets slightly warm but the wires are cool to the touch.<br /><br />The beam produced is OK but I feel like it could definitely be better. Can't really complain for the price, though. It's not a pencil beam nor is it a flood beam - it's a &#34;driving beam&#34; which is supposed to offer a mix between spill (flood) and throw (distance).
B006N9F46M|5|Fit my 2003 Honda Odyssey EXL good and is working fine so far after 200 miles of city pot hole filled driving.  I would recommend on an Odyssey to replace these and the front strut units every 80k miles.  The Odyssey is very abusive on front end components and tires.
B0009IQY7G|5|Just as advertised, thanks
B002C7DSIK|4|more anchors would be great
B008LNQ7IW|5|Doesn't get any more accurate! The light is really brite at night but my kids like it cause it's like a traveling party!
B007WS4ONM|5|Perfect Match
B000CHML8A|4|It fits my car correctly.I like it.
B00U8RP7T4|5|If you've ever had to install stereo speakers or replace a mirror or window motor, it probably required removing the inside door panel.  I've done it before with a screw driver and angled cutters that would slide under the lip of the plastic clip.  I either ended up cutting right through them or breaking the lip.  These tools help save that trip to the auto parts store for new clips.  Each tool is made of durable ABS plastic, so they shouldn't scratch your surfaces like metal can.  The angled pry bar design of allows you to get under the lip of the clip or trim piece while still giving you leverage and strong, solid coverage to pop it out of place.<br /><br />No matter which part of the car your working on, something in this tool kit will assist in the job.  There were no instructions or details about each piece, but as each of the tools is of the same design, they should be interchangeable depending on the space you're working in.  The tools aren't very large, but they should be of good size for any size hand while maintaining control.  You should always follow proper safety precautions, and these are definitely safer then using a incorrectly using a tool designed for something else.  Please note, I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
B012TZ552G|5|Great price from Amazon, and a very easy installation in my 2000 Pontiac Montana. Clean air is flowing into the cabin once again!!!
B00GKQN12C|5|Got this for my daughter and she loved it. Prompt shipping.
B00FEZ4MEG|2|Item only works after turning on power of light itself not the power button on plug. I wish I read the reviews I never would have purchased  it.
B008A5Y0HG|5|Works good got on time
B00Z3ZWB68|5|Works great for controlling high voltage items. These are a must have in anyone's collection.!
B002N2MVWS|5|On time, proper packaging, perfect fit, hard to ask for anything more.
B003V9TC10|2|These metal valve extenders do not seal properly.  When the extender is fully tightened on to the valve stem so that air is not leaking out the valve is stem is not depressed enough for air to be added to the tire or for air to exit the valve so the pressure can be read with a gauge.  So...they are essentially worthless.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Best thing going but over price, After buying I found that SAM CLUB had them 1/2 the price I paid.
B005CO9GX6|5|Excellent
B00FS98XB6|5|Very good part. Thanks
B000IDUW5C|5|Nice backup emergency escape tool if I cannot reach my LifeHammer after an accident.
B0055AW0N0|3|Takes up a little too much room in the Camaro
B00FIU54BW|5|after hearing good reviews about the product, I tried this on my 2010 HONDA PILOT exterior plastic trims which was colored white already from the residue of the waxes/sealants I have used in the past. I agree with the other users about the lines the applicator creates but found a way to apply it properly, so instead of going back and forth with each application I tried to apply it on the surface top to bottom in 1-2 stroke only and not to go over it again in that way it will saturate the area more and prevent the foam from absorbing the dye. it might be too much but it did made the trims look nice and new. Thanks.
B0002JM69W|3|You get what you pay for.  It &#34;works,&#34; but you can definitely feel the wires.  I am upgrading to something nicer after using this for two months.
B00OUTEQT8|5|Price was right and they all worked!
B00K3WPL0Y|5|Great product
B000EQ8HH8|5|worked great
B00XOKN0XW|3|When the car turns on. You have to turn it on everytime.. very annoying. Other than that, I think it does what it is suposed to do, Clean air.
B001ECULXY|5|Installed myself on a 2000 Monte Carlo. Worked great and easy install if you know what you are doing. Remember to get an alignment when you are done.
B0010DQX6Q|5|perfect in honda 1999
B00SVKSF80|5|Very happy.
B00EK5EVQA|5|Great product. Had one issue and the company replace one in a couple of days
B0072UQ0EG|5|I put this on my 2011 Toyota Tacoma TRD double cab. The product matched up with factory mounting holes and was on in no time. I'm thoroughly satisfied with the look and quality of the product. It was packaged well and didn't have any damage upon receiving.
B000P18N6W|5|Great.
B00O3MOLTM|5|Sticker for all to see free ads for you
B000COS0PG|5|No problems
B00PGRGSH6|5|These bulbs are great!!  I'm using them for the rear turns for a 2016 Subaru WRX.  I was using a more expensive pair of Morimoto bulbs that were nice and bright, but they did not put out enough light to the sides, so in the day time, you could hardly see the light reflecting off the inner housing area of the turn signal location.  These JDM ASTAR LEDs have alleviated that problem and for only 2/3 the price of the Morimotos!  I can't speak to the longevity of these lights, but I've been buying a lot of different LEDs from JDM ASTAR since about July 2015, and have had zero issues so far.
B008032QSI|5|Very good
B001KSG3QQ|1|The description said it would fit on Honda accords 03-07 but it did not fit my 04. I tried to push it into the casing hoping it would click in but it just broke. If you have a 04 accord go somewhere else for your replacement.
B005EY2X16|5|We have a 2014 GMC Terrain and these fit perfectly. Super easy to install and withstood a 900 mile drive.
B006N9FWBY|5|great
B000FFY8VC|5|I switch cars frequently and this product is really helpful. I can just take it out of one and stick it into the next car. The suction mounts are strong. Not sure how long they will last but so far so good!!
B00SZK1L7I|4|I have HID's stock on my Avalon.  But the bright lights made me sick.  So I bought these to change he high beams out.  That being said,  if your low beams are dim and you need bright light on back roads.  Don't do these.  They are bright to a point.  They do look cool,  but not functional.  DRL's at best.  These are not bad and the description is correct.  Just so people know,  they do exactly what they advertise.
B004AGAWV2|3|DO NOT ORDER FOR A 2008 HONDA ACCORD EX-L for the front if you have a North American Production car Identified By 1st Digit Of VIN 1, 2, 4 Or 5.  These vehicles need an 11.81 inch front rotor, which these are not.  These should work for an LX, but I would double check the measurements. Ignore what the BOSH site has too which as the time of this review is also incorrect. I have included two pictures. One you can see the measurement. The other is the installed pictured. In the installed picture you can see the brake pad overlaps the Disc.  Also, In case anyone is curious, these are made in China.
B000CMFRJK|4|Mat fits great. Nice deep tray to hold in anything that may spill. It needs to have the grippy points on the bottom to keep it from sliding around though. The Husky liner I got for in front of the seats have them. I'm not sure why they don't put them on the cargo may though. Would give 5 stars if they did.
B005ZWM0R4|5|Great Deal. Thank You. Love it! Works Great
B00OOGCMXY|1|Not a good items because within a few minutes burned.
B005C2ADX0|5|Works great, arrived on time. I would recommend.
B001D9E41I|5|Works great...
B0024NSUH6|4|They look great so far and were an exact replacement for the original with the exception of the wire spring-clamp that holds one of the bulbs.  Fortunately, we still had the original unit and were able to swap out for a perfect fit.<br /><br />It would be nice if they came with installation instructions too.
B000C21GKO|3|after bending and twisting I finally got the bracket to line up, it took way more time than I had planned on spending on the install fit could be better
B001FANSGM|5|If you got 4inches of lift this is must even three inches of lift it corrects bump steering the ones they say are for up to 4 inches of lift are not long enough
B00WL0AXDG|3|Thought the construction of the top rail cover was not long time durable
B00OCAICC2|5|Fit perfectly!
B002O7AKJI|5|Perfect fit, super bright, installed in a 1996 Honda cbr 600f3.
B000I4JPZE|1|Product was used despite new purchase and new purchase price.  Also thinner than most trailer tires above small trailers.
B00KQFOL0E|5|I love this kit as it is one of the first kits I purchased. It looks fantastic and is altogether a great purchase.
B00BHH1QMG|1|Follow-up review...<br />I applied 3M Paint Defender 18 months and 12,000 miles ago. I followed the instructions to the letter, including applying the 3M synthetic wax first, to aid in removal. The product looked good for about 6 weeks, and then began to yellow. After 6 months, it was dingy yellow. The surface was rough and held dirt and bird droppings to the extent that the area with the &#34;protectant&#34; did not come clean in car washes.<br /><br />Today, I went to remove it, and discovered that it does not simply peel off. Despite the pre-wax, the coating resists removal, and I ended up using my fingernail to tediously scrape it off, bit by bit. After an hour, I had removed about 1/8 of the coating. I have seen youtube videos where it just peels off. Perhaps you are not supposed to leave it on more than a few months. Perhaps I did not put it on thickly enough, although I used the entire can on 2/3 of the hood.<br /><br />At any rate, don't buy this product. You won't be happy.
B0002KKIJQ|5|I have used this on three small tires and so far so good.
B001JEIHAG|1|These lights are not what I was expecting.. I ordered three and put them all in and one of them was burned out and never worked so I had to changed it back to a halogen light.! Extremely disappointed with this product I will never buy them again
B003YJJS2U|5|Keeps moisture off the electric jack controls.
B004VROJ32|5|just as advertized.  a great addition at a very low price
B000221M94|5|Does the job and won't rip when installing if brute force is not used. Measure where door will touch and easy does it.
B002YL1U5C|5|Came quick and was easy to install. Love it
B000ET525K|5|Works.  Probably the best out there
B003IHKXKY|3|Kinda Cheesy but it works.
B00T2GT9L4|5|I was skeptical, especially when I saw how small the Anker jump starter is (10000mAh model).  After receiving it I decided to test it before I got rid of my jumper cables.  I ran the battery in my 2014 Honda really low.....the Anker started it with no problem, as advertised.  The next day my neighbors' F-250 pickup truck wouldn't start. It has a 6.2 liter gas engine (the Anker is suppose to start up to 5.0 liter gas engine.  Well, it started the truck.  I let it stand connected until the ready light went out.  Then I reconnected the Anker and it started right up.  Note it was summer time which may or may not make a difference.<br /><br />Pros:  Small, not nearly tiny size.<br />Everything I needed in the (very neat) carrying case.<br />The Anker has a built in flashlight and to USB charging ports that can charge a cell phone or tablet.<br />The base unit is small enough to fit easily in a glove box.<br />Kit included:  USB to micro USB cord, charger cord for cigarette lighter, charger cord for 110 volts, battery jumping cord (of course).<br />Good for an astonishing 25 jumps<br />4 LED lights that indicate the charge level of the unit.  (After 2 jumps mine still read 4 lights.)w<br />The battery within the Anker needs to be recharged only every 3-4 months<br /><br />Cons:  The battery within the Anker needs to be recharged every 3-4 months.<br />The complete kit, while very nice is too big to fit inside under my seat or within my car without being in view.  Solution: I store the base unit with a flashlight and USB ports inside my car.  I store the kit containing the jumper and the chargers with the spare tire (I have an SUV.)<br /><br />Today's new cars have MUCH more electronics.  Many of which are on when your not looking.  The batteries are lighter and smaller.  In ten years of owning my previous Honda SUV I had to get the car jumped once.  In the first six months of owning my 2014 Honda I need to have it jumped 3 times.  Now I am self sufficient.
B00IPS4APU|5|This is a fantastic product. It worked well and did exactly what it said it would do. You cannot even tell there was a chip in my windshield. It came with very simple step by step instructions and was very easy to use.
B000CNA032|1|Does not fit Dana 35.
B003K00B24|1|You get what you pay for and these are cheap.  The metal bends too easily.  One end of the box actually had a reject sticker from the manufacturer on the box.  The metal is cheap and scratches easily.  They do not sit right in the holes of the tundra we bought them for.  It says universal but they really don't fit to cover the entire section of the opening.  One of the foot pads had rust on it.
B00XULVDHK|5|The shades were easy for me to put on. I haven't used the suction cups, not sure I need them. I like the shades and have no complaints.<br />I was half expecting them to be ruined when my husband tried to roll the Windows down without realizing it was on there, but they weren't. A customer sales representative from Jomolly contacted me to see how I liked them which Was a nice little touch
B00W2RBI0K|5|I bought this Thursday morning and received an email with the expected delivery being between the 26th to the 31st, so I was surprised when I got a delivery confirmation Saturday while out of town. I couldn't gather from the description exactly how this fit into the cargo area since there are the pockets/bins towards the hatch. Since this is the first and only SUV I have owned or even looked at I assumed the tray would just be a flat liner that fit only the main compartment, it is not.<br /><br />I was happily surprised to find out the tray is not only of good quality, but it fits into the pockets as well. While they were slightly deformed from packaging, rolled up, after a few hours it was back to shape. This was purchased in case of spills or other accidents in transport and to also help keep dog fur from getting throughout the area.<br /><br />The only concern I had was how my dogs would react because the one is very particular about certain surfaces and materials; she had no issues when put directly on the tray. Another plus is that it seems to keep whatever is being transported in place during transportation.<br /><br />I would not only highly recommend this to any person looking for full coverage in their cargo area, but I would buy it again should I ever need to. The price from Amazon was also better than from Mazda; they wanted $30 for shipping and even with it being on sale it still would have been more expensive.
B00PRTXTMK|1|Piece of junk.  So lightweight it felt like it was going to fall apart.  Little suction.  Didn't try the wet part.  No instructions.
B00O83ULPE|4|They fit and work. The three clear plastic circles stick out too much, looks like rockets. Reminds me of the old Cadillac fins.lol
B0026N33TY|5|This crankshaft sensor is a life saver.  It arrived fast and my husband installed it on my 2002 Sebring.  It had stopped on me twice and I took it to a shop and was told they couldn't find anything wrong.  I did a lot of research online and learned the problem could be engine sludge or a bad crankshaft sensor.  Since I've always gotten oil changes, I opted for the sensor being the problem.  It cost less than $20 and my husband saved me a several hundred dollars by installing it himself.  So far the Sebring hasn't stopped on me again.
B00DJ2D45O|2|Didn't work as advertised.
B00NYCGFIW|1|What you see is not what you get 90.00 for a20.00 hitch.
B000PEQMNA|1|not easy install that
B00JAPDJZO|5|Great product customer service through email was perfect but would rather talk to someone on the phone.
B00AYC5IQ0|5|No complaints, although I recommend getting a pair of goggles for eye protection. I bought an L sized, worried it may have been a little too big but it fits perfectly, maybe even a little snug. Might want to pay careful attention to the dimensions. Easy to wear and buckle. Not as bulky and clumsy as other helmets with visors. Gets a lot of compliments but doesn't draw unnecessary attention.
B00PB625C4|4|It works... nothing amazing but it's convenient
B00IKKS4W8|3|Bought this as a replacement for a broken stabilizer jack on our new to us travel trailer. After the first use, the jack broke where the wrench attaches to the jack when I went to raise it back up to come home. Had to completely remove the stabilizer jack prior to traveling as the jack would no longer stay up. Looks as if the locking mechanism broke where the rod was held to the jack.  Update, after some investigating, found the pin behind the washer had snapped off. Replaced the pin and jack is working again. Updated to 3 stars.
B00C4ON3OU|1|I bought this product and payed 275 $ to have my mechanic put them in and 1 was faulty so I him replace it again for another 275$ and the second one was faulty. This product is garbage. Waste of money. Now I'm out $ 550 + 60 on these pieces of garbage.
B001TI5IIQ|4|With this kit, a little determination, and a lot of elbow grease, you too can have clear headlights. My headlight began to fog up approximately six months after but my vehicle is also fairly old (1998 200k miles) and the headlights could have been restored previously.
B00JLJU9R0|5|I was very pleased with the part work great
B000BWEH6K|5|perfect!
B000FF76KM|5|Great
B00B3YKUDY|5|Plenty and I mean PLENTY of room. Very well made. Easy install but I would definitely use a couple of small bungee cords to help hold it down because I do not trust the plastic buckles on it.  I don't trust plastic clips and buckles on anything that will be holding some weight.
B000C5UFQC|4|Fixed the problem.
B004AQVQ3A|5|Been using boat all summer without any issues.
B00IEYDZTC|5|Great replacement wheels.
B009SAQ28C|5|Fit perfect & works great
B001GRQQFE|5|Very good
B00I4X48R6|5|excellent
B006GFLI0O|4|Fits betterm than a different one, it is bigger which is nice. The sweat band portion works well and the rest is vented to breath well.
B00E8HGCEY|5|works great
B00VSC6BDY|4|This is way better than just having a visor.  You can unsnap the visor and slide this to the right to block out center-windshield sun.  You can move the visor to the left as in the photo, then slide the extender toward the back of the car to block side sun.  I'm guessing that for fear that some would fold down the tab in such a way as to block the rear view mirror or side-forward view, and that must be the reason the fold-down tab isn't long enough to keep side sun off of the arms nearest the doors.  So, sad to say, the fold-down tab is pretty much worthless, but still and all, sliding this extender as described above, makes driving much more pleasant on sunny days.  UPDATE:  It's a year and a half after having got these and still love them.  I live in the South where the sun is strong - I drive south every morning to work with the sun on the left side of my face, and drive north every evening home from work with the sun on the left side of my face.  These protect the left side of my face from sun damage.  So glad I found them.  They're still just like new.
B005C1Y9D6|4|The lights are all bright and really good looking. Installation was alittle hassle because not all the lights worked right away required a bit of moving in the socket.
B00MFY94RY|4|This ribbon was just the right size for my rear window of my car.  It looks good and is just what I expected.
B004SFTO28|5|Smoothed out the ride in my 05' ram nicely.
B0027ETJ9U|5|Works great with my car.
B0002SA5MS|4|Works as designed and adds a little custom to your Tracker. The only issue I have with it is if you use it with the Bestop bikini top it will leak a little from the slits that have to be opened to install it.
B00PLLVP98|5|Amazing purchase! Fast shipping!
B009S4SZFG|1|Bought this to pull the 5 finger clutch hub off my Shovelhead, it didn't fit so Amazon sent a new one & that won't fit. Very disappointed but I don't blame Amazon.
B0041WCV50|5|Love them!
B005PZMKZI|2|Colors great,but doesn't fit very well
B0006IX7Y2|5|Works as described. Easy to take out and put away.
B0053CMPI0|5|It is very nice.  Thinking of ordering another for my other set of keys.
B00OGOWWJ8|5|Very nice
B008VGJ2F4|5|Gone are the days of hand jacking the camper! perfect bolt alignment, easy wiring.
B001F0I4SE|2|Mirror moves going down the road by itself!
B00O2IMGKS|4|I have used this brand before and they perform and last as long as any other top rated, so based on price, getting all four for the price of 2 or 3 was a good deal. The FJ Cruiser has 3 front blades, so I'll replace them all at once in the Fall
B000E4OHXI|5|Fit like a factory made part.  Works beautifully.
B007Z8VG30|4|Smaller than expected but good quality
B0019O1BS6|1|It did not fit on my 2012 Honda Civic, as they say it would... If would have been five star if it did...
B00U2NHLTI|1|They work well they do as advertised however the lumen output is less than a standard halogen h11. It is bright close to the truck but at a distance it looses intensity quickly. Doesn't replace a headlamp that is h11 it really is just a fog lamp.<br /><br />Update. These didn't last as advertised. I have contacted philips for warranty. I have heard nothing. These are a definite do not buy. Neither of them are still working.
B000GU3NKS|5|Good quality product! Arrived just in time for installation before heading to Sturgis 2015!
B00480J4QY|4|Great set of bulbs that I have been using for about half a year now. Still alive and bright!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Brighter than stock bulb<br />Plug and play<br />Whiter in color<br /><br />Cons:<br />None<br /><br />Recommend?<br />Most definitely for the better performance and value!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4/15/16--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Bulbs just went out, used it from 3/10/15 to 4/15/16, got stopped by the cops :(<br />Changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars because I wish it would last a little longer.<br />I estimated I used it roughly 0.5-1 hour a day.<br />Overall, I'd still recommend as I understand it does use more energy than the stock OEM thus producing more light and heat in the process. Just look forward to changing every year and possibly having some on hand.
B00ZQW0660|5|Honda really cheaped out not including a nice exhaust tip on the 9th Gen.  Civic.  I bought this unit off Ebay for slightly less, but it is the same part as many outlets sell it.  Although made in China, it is a solid piece, well engineered, and nicely chromed.  It bolts on easily and securely.  The oval shape is perfect as is the size as it compliments the rear lines of the Civic. As this is a 1 pound hunk of steel secured by only 2 bolts, I installed a safety wire from the exhaust  tip to the muffler hanger  to keep this from flying off onto the road if it should shake loose.  That would be very bad for cars behind you.  Even though the tip almost touches the rear fascia, it does not rattle against the bodywork.  In the 3rd photo you will see how I added a short piece of plumber's tape from the attachment bolt then simply attached a length of baling wire from there up to the support bracket. I am very pleased with my bang for the buck quotient, this is one mod you should absolutely do!
B004B61B34|5|What can I say, it's a trailer hitch? Installed the hitch on a 2014 Jeep JK and did the wiring in 20 minutes. Then hauled a cargo rack with bicycles from Florida to Tennessee and back without fail. I'm an ASE Master Auto Technician and the fit and quality reflected genuine Mopar/Jeep parts.
B000VKYD70|5|just what we needed
B00AC5J7Q6|5|If you need this, you know it.<br />Mostly I want to talk about the company, Signal Dynamics.These folks were AWESOME.<br />I have H7 bulbs on a motorcycle that does NOT use H7 connectors. (Honda CBR300R 2015). There's a weird adapter from Honda that is completely proprietary.<br />So this could not work on my motorcycle. I had to get the universal harness (you can order only on their company, Amazon doesn't have it, and you need to call to get the part number/order). Anyway, they helped me get the part I needed, and were really helpful, fast...<br />So kudos for that company. And if you have the same motorcycle, get the model with the universal harness, i.e. get ready to splice your wires.
B003MB4NUC|4|Real nice fit and they look good also.
B00U15L3H8|5|It does what it's supposed to do and is definitely loud about it worth buying for that little bit of protection to help your mind be at ease about your moped/bike
B00FRHOLK6|5|Great wiper blades. Have used this style and brand for years on all my vehicles. They last for years and just keep on going. You will never know how bad your old blades are until you change them out for a high quality set.
B000E9QF0Q|5|Just like every other product I've tried so far from them, the California Gold Instant Detailer also has a pleasant, almost spice-like aroma to it which makes it nice to use. It sprays on clear, and with one wipe you get a great looking clean shine from your vehicle's paint. It doesn't seem to pick up any dust the day after either. Good stuff, I've used other quick detailers and they are all very similar in performance, so the nice scent of the Mother's product is a nice little bonus that just makes it great to use.
B00802GIW4|5|Great lights look good. Great price
B00SDFFN2O|5|The backrest was excellent. For the price it is great. I returned it because I just didn't like the feeling of it.<br />I'm giving it 5 stars because it is a great deal it's just I don't like the the fit for myself
B000HVTERW|3|Good
B00D8TWSTQ|2|Bought this to proudly display on my truck.  Unfortunately, the &#34;for prison&#34; part of the sticker is so small that people though I was a Hillary supporter.  Ugh.  Had to remove it ASAP.
B005JU5YCU|1|Should have returned these the first week.  They were leaving streaks from the very first use.  Now, after a couple of months, they are so bad that I'll be replacing with something else.  They obviously had defects in the blade edges.  The driver's side was leaving two streaks, and the passenger side, one, when still new.  Mounted on a 2014 Honda Odyssey, and the windshield had been clay barred before putting these on.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|It's small enough to fit in my bag and compatible with SO many devices its eliminated all my portable back-up batteries, with the added benefit that I can use it to jumpstart my car in case of emergency.
B001JT5PCY|1|Adhesive fell off less than 12 hours after I applied it. Had to use superglue to secure it
B000CD382M|3|I bought these for my 2003 Ford F250 in 2008.  They still hold a charge and absorb shock.  However, the metal has rusted very badly.  There are holes through the dust shields and I expect the gas to start leaking soon.  They come with a lifetime warranty and I am going to try and replace them under the warranty because they worked well.  I think I am going to paint the new pair with better paint than Monroe uses.
B00K1L27JK|5|Great look & sound. Not to loud. Can't hear inside at highway  speed. A little more pep in the step and slight increase in MPG. Can't be beat for price.
B0045JYUY4|4|fit the roof rails just fine but the bolts were a little tight, and you need to be careful not to strip out the aluminum threads. Once on, worked perfectly. Took almost 30 minutes to install and align.
B00BSG3AIE|4|Fairly good, not supper bright.
B00F3KK9JO|5|FOLKS GETTING A REAL LAUGH FROM THIS ON MY ENTRY DOOR TO THE HOUSE
B0067PUMXW|5|Came with a little bonus sticker and they applied nicely!
B00S1E1KVA|5|Excellent - way better than paying $35 at jiffy lube!
B005CLMQJ0|5|Working fine,fix good and good quality<br />Thanks
B006O85P9I|5|Seems to be holding up ;)
B004M4WHHE|5|Will it fit on a malibu 2013 ????
B00HFLEEB8|5|Perfect replacement for my RV - license plate tail light.
B001AWLJG6|5|Works great.
B004EBS7GK|4|Does a good job of protecting the paint when using the lockout tool. Does a better job when I put a light coat of baby powder on the lock out tool. Tool does not have a tendency to stick or rub the door gasket as bad
B00LG07MZE|3|Very lightweight easy to apply it does its purpose.
B0031GVTPA|5|It was fine..!
B0074FQKDA|5|Good job.
B00A59IBWK|5|Such a good thing to be able to find this online for 1/3 the price it was locally. The balljoint broke while I was driving. Somehow, I got to a parking lot without dying. The control arm was scraping the inside of the wheel hard, and that saved me from crashing.
B00AZOH9EG|5|as advertised
B001PWFPRU|3|It works okay.  Cable likes to get stuck between gate and fender.
