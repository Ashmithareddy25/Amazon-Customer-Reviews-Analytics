B0081JAED0|5.0|After so many amazing songs and albums, they always have a new,fresh way of presenting it... It is definitely one of those albums you just play from track 1 and let it go to the end.
B009O07NDY|2.0|I'm very sorry to disagree with so many others, but I have to say that as a long- time fan of both Peter Jackson and Howard Shore I found this soundtrack very disappointing.<br />Unlike the 2-disc soundtracks released with the Lord of the Rings series (which are now almost impossible to find for under a small fortune), this set IS NOT the film score! It is a collection of songs that feels like a slightly- extended basic soundtrack, along with a few tracks added which we never heard in the film (Previews for the next film, I suppose? What will go on that album then?).<br />The way the music is arranged, you never really have that sustained feeling of majesty that the other soundtracks achieved. Instead, you're constantly jerked around between music that is too quiet, then too bombastically loud, then on occasion showing a little of that glory you know it is capable of.<br />Cosmetically speaking, the case is disgraceful considering how much it costs compared to the \\"basic\\" soundtrack. It's overpriced cardboard with a bunch of silly iphone app features printed into it, a book about the album mostly dominated by pictures, and slots that barely hold your CDs in place. Yes, I'm sure it's cheaper for the record company and better for the environment, but it doesn't provide much protection for your discs at all!<br />All negativity aside, there are a few absolute gems in this set, including recordings of \\"Blunt the Knives\\" and \\"Misty Mounstains\\", though I am disappointed that these were not recorded longer for the album. Would it really have been that difficult to ask Mr. Armitage to sing the entire song, or at least more than a minute's worth of it for the fans who shelled out the money for this?<br />A few of the instrumental songs are glorious, showing the genius that made Howard Shore famous, and \\"Song of the Misty Mountain\\" is a wonderful piece.<br />If I could do it again, I would probably go online and listen to different songs on the soundtrack, find the best tracks, then just download those ones.<br />A decent effort, but certainly nowhere near as good as it could have been.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|John Hiatt is one of the more prolific song writers of our era, and a great one. His music is simple yet sophisticated with lyrics that always touch home.
B001A3AA0G|5.0|I really like this album.<br />Fast download<br />Cheapter than any other place I could get it.<br />Highly recommend album<br />Buy it
B008O69SZ0|4.0|Haven't purchased an Ian Hunter release in several years. Stummbled across this one. Has a great balance of melodic and standard rock count numbers. Fresh.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|My daughter downloaded it.  I am not a game player.  Appropriate for all ages.  It seems like lots of action is in it.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Caught the video &#34;Gotsta get paid&#34; and was so happy to hear ZZ sounding rough, hard and back to their rocking roots. The rest of the songs continue this direction and hit the mark.
B006YC74E8|3.0|It's a bit tricky trying to take pictures.  You have to play with it to get a decent picture.  It can do what it's suppose to do.  I am used to high tech technology and I felt that I had to play too much with it to take a picture.<br /><br />It's good for all ages.
0307592731|5.0|I think that the author has spoken her mind very candidly for the past which she had experienced from the time her mother had passed away.<br />I've never read this kind of a non-fiction story. Especially anyone could be healed through contacting the Mother nature, like her hard-working and painful tracking. It made me moved from the deep in mind, reading the books. So many painful remember of her past time in the book could be felt and I wish many people to get the good lessons to recuperate form the pains in ourlives which we have to overcome. We could be healed from our old sufferings or pains, as she had overcome her pains.<br />I would rather recommend this book for the people in pain now.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|My daughter downloaded it.  It seems like she enjoys it, but me personally I am not into the game.  I can be good for all ages.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|OMG addicted to this and have gotten so many other using this as well.  Really makes you think outside the box!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good reading.  I was intense at times and had me coming back for more. Book is appropriate only for adults.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book...just about finished with it and looking forward to the next one.  Easy reading and at time it was very difficult to put down.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I really needed a calculator that breaks down percentage.  Unfortunately, this one does not have the capability.<br /><br />Anyone can use it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm My little ponies biggest fan. So when I saw the game I just had to get it. So if you are a My little pony fan get the app.

0345525558|4.0|Had not finished reading this book yet but the title was intriguing and my book club decided to check it out.  Book arrived on time and in great shape.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a good way to get my nephew when he was bedridden and the best way to get him to go back to bed JJKK!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|i very much enjoyed this game. it was engaging and time passed quickly while i was playing. i hope to see more of this kind.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is a fun game.  You get to use your creativity to make vehicles to get pieces that you need to beat the level.  I like the challenge.  I would recommend this game to people who like angry birds.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|interesting movie, kind of nice to go back in time a bit.  Of course Helen Hunt was as usual a great actress.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Similar to Downton Abbey, this show focuses on different aspects of English history during the 1930s. This family and their servents are caught in the middle of the politics of London. Very good representation of the times.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I got this because it was 3.99 on the kindle store. I had seen this on a bunch of best of lists so decided to check it out, even though I have never read any Steven King before. This is such a page turner and so well written!! I can see now why Mr. King is as popular as he is. The book does dip a little in the middle, but it picks up and keeps the momentum going til the end. It does not end the way I thought it would. I would also like to add (hope this isn't too much of a spoiler) that I could read an entire novel of King writing about 50's America and Jake Epping's adventures. Such a pleasant surprise.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you think that this show is just about killing zombies then you are wrong. That's the reason why I refused to watch it for 2 years but then I decided to check it out and I was hooked. If you like Dexter and Breaking Bad then you will LOVE Walking Dead. The writing is excellent.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|having some trouble seems i missed something and cant go back to get it  pretty good good game till then
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year old grandson and I have a ball playing and putting the puzzles together. He's to the point where he tries to do it faster than me. Great game!
B00BESCUKK|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who like Qunton Tarentino movies. Always hits hit off the charts. Might buy this and add it to my Martial Arts Collection.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great CD! One of the favorites listened to on a 12 hour trip in the car. So emotional and relatable to everyone!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I missed the characters when it was concluded.  Reminded me of a darker Maeve Binchy.  Well done!  I really enjoyed it and hope for a sequel.
B0013FNC38|5.0|So many different sides of Jason Mraz is shown in this CD! I would recommend this CD to anyone. He is so talented! And, I'm an old lady!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|While the Shining is still my standby favorite, this was positively the best Stephen King book I have read in years.  I wanted life to stop while I was reading it.  Such a terrific read.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Although Michael Jackson had over successful and number one hits -- these are<br />the ones I will always remember him by.
B00846F1YW|3.0|The only thing I would change is it is too wordy.<br /><br />I understand they would like to make it more interesting with a story line, but really I just want to play the game.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Classic short stories with understated emotion.  worthy of re-reading over and over!  Highly recommend to all who apppreciate stunning writing and good story telling.
B005HJAOLY|1.0|I was disappointment with the length of this short story vs the purchase cost. The story itself was not one King's finer publications and it felt like the ending was put together in 5 minutes. This really should be part of a compendium of short stories rather than a stand alone novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well it is official that this is now on my kindle, ipod and my husbands phone. the kids and my husband are always playing this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is quite interesting. I love Horses allot so this really is great for me. The graphics are excellent. They never seem cartoonish at all. I recommend that you get this app
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my dad because he has been searching for it for years and we could never find it. Thankfully amazon.com had it available and I ordered it right away. It is a very good movie for those who havent seen it. The delivery service was quick and easy. I ordered the product on Monday and it arrived at my door on Wednesday. It seems to be in great condition, with no issues. I am very sastified.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Very exciting and entertaining. Addictive and miss it when the seaon ends The story line and actors are so great
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The plot is well written, and the characters are well-developed. I'm kept in suspense and surprise as the story continues.
B005PK56TA|4.0|An interesting series--I got hooked.  The pilot, so-so.  It got better in the second episode.  I didn't find it particularly frightening overall.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I WANT MY 5 DOLLARS BACK. I bought a 50 pack of gems..I bought nothing except I saved myself from dying 4 times and now I have 19 left. WTF is that??? Its a fun game but the money sucking bs has to go. Deleting from all 9 of our devices and posting it all over DO NOT BUY
0714844659|5.0|For people who like to read and cook, especially small meals and tea meals, I recommend this book.  I encouraged my son, while he was living in France for a year, to go visit the Rose Bakery.  He sadly didn't have the time before returning home, but I assured him I would make him some of the recipes.  I find books like these inspiring for trying new recipes.  I am grateful for those who write down their recipes, and experiences, and I will try them out with great hope that they will please the ones I cook for!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I think that this game is pretty good. I like the challenge of looking for items.  I like that it has a story with it, makes you part of it.
B00846F1YW|3.0|It's fun doing the various &quot;missions&quot; but the conversations take toooo loonnnggg in between.  Still fun, though.  I may try it on my Kindle.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|I don't think I need to say anything, this is such a great movie! CLassic from when I was a kid, now I get to enjoy it as an Adult on Blu-ray!
B0083VP2KQ|3.0|I gave it three stares because it had parts of other video's I have of Dinosaur's.  There is some new parts, still a keeper and not a send back.  If this was a first time video of Dinosaur for me it would be a good one.  I just hate getting these and finding parts of other video's in them.<br /> This rating is for the one's that made the video ,  not the one's that sold it.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|It took me a while to get through it...but I'm glad I did.  Still trying to figure out what the moral of it all is though...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game! Challenging yet easy enough for any age. Great for passing the time or playing on the go. You should defiantly download this game you won't regret it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Can't wait for the movie.  I'm not a big zombie fan but this was written in a way that felt like I was reading a real documentary.

B001IXXYBA|5.0|This movie is so sad but yet so touching and no matter how many times I watch it, its like watching it for the first time. I am so happy that now I own it and can watch it anytime.

B003VPWX6K|5.0|I cannot remember the last time I was so captured by a novel. This is a gem of a story, masterfully told by a brilliant author. A motion picture based on this story was released in the nineties, I think, with Anthony Hopkins as the emotionally restrained butler and Emma Thompson in the other leading part. I liked the movie very much, but the novel works on several deeper levels. The main character is a butler at a countryside mansion who strives his whole life to live up the highest standards of his profession, to the point that he compromises everything that is most valuable in life. Though it is set during the first half of the 20th century, many modern professionals will no doubt identify with this character. He finds himself witnessing interesting developments in international affairs in this mansion at the time around world war two, but these are mostly a backdrop to a story about his choices in life. What I like most about this book is that, although it is evident that everything that should be valuable to the butler is slowly going down the pipes, the story never becomes sentimental. Disaster lurks beneath the surface throughout and the tension and attraction between the characters are beautifully understated. I don't know how Ishiguro managed to do this but you simply find yourself glued to the book. Why are you still reading this? Read the book instead. You will love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game they need to make a part 2<br />Me and the whole family playing this and many of my friends to please keep up the good work
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really liked this book. It kept me wondering who really did it. It was definitely worth reading. A must read.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|We were so looking forward to seeing this and so terribly let down when we did.  Very few parts were watchable.  So sad to see Bond ruined like this!
B000X2H8G4|2.0|The Sonic SE4000 does work and for the money, I guess it is so-so.  It does pickup a lot of background noise which I guess is to be expected but I was more unhappy that the headset is nearly impossible to adjust.  Just doesn't fit very well at all.  I haven't yet checked to see if a different headset could be used in place of the one that came with the purchase, but I would have preferred to pay a little more and got a better headset in the package.
B00A6D5GBE|1.0|No instructions on how to play game, I removed it from my device, myabe its to simple and its meant for children.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Has many different pictures and levels of play for each picture.  Can't beat it for the price.  The only hitch is that scrolling and choosing a puzzle piece; it can flicker and have difficulty bringing the preview piece to the puzzle itself.  I would advise others to get this app, and try it out for themselves.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Seriously Amazon, don't solicit a review when I'm just trying to improve your recommendations. I liked it. A lot! Thank you.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Makes weather easy to access! Only The Weather Channel can give this easy to read access to the weather! It's free and easy!
B00533D3CQ|1.0|This seems tired and formulaic, as if he's not even trying, and let's face it, he's too long in the tooth for this stuff anymore.
B004XISI4A|5.0|There are times in this book that will frustrate you. The story is slow developing but it's all worth it. The amount of detail is amazing. I can taste the food at times. The plot, as always, is amazing. When you think you know what's going on, George throws a curve Ball. Amazing book!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is a wonderful movie. It's a rare princess movie that is about her relationship with her mother, not about getting saved or finding a man. And, being Pixar, you know it's stunning and fun to watch.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As a latecomer to the Downton Abbey &#34;mania&#34; I am sorry it took me so long to watch this incredibly entertaining series. Each character is well written and well developed. I even love the characters that I dislike! O.K., I'll admit that it is a soap opera but so is Mad Men and I love that one too. The difference between the two is that I could watch Downton Abbey with my sons or my parents. As the Dowager Countess of Grantham said &#34;Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.&#34; Plenty of wit and no vulgarity in Downton Abbey!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a great way to waste time.  When you have a few extra minutes (spare time) this is the best way to spend it.  Good job, great game.
B005N09L5C|1.0|I would have given it no stars but you have to give at least one. It was dark, dull, vulgar, and I didn't care about any of the characters. I actually stopped trying to watch it after about forty minutes.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie is informative and eye-opening. I appreciate the tone in which it is done. It is serious but not harsh. It does not try to be unnecessarily alarming, although the topic is. It calls for a thoughtful response in terms of how we live on this earth.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This show is one of my favorites. The plots are always interesting and they lead to more questions than they answer. The actors are overall good, although Anna Torv is a little one demensional. Joshua Jackson and John Noble are very good and both have some great one liners.<br />Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes the whole syfy, paranornal, conspiracy theory type of show.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun to play and always is ready to go when you are bored.  I recommend this to everyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if your bored and want something to play then download this app. it does take a while to earn enough points to get more games but its very simple.
B000Y96EWK|5.0|I loved the movies, I wanted to add the CD's to my video collection. I found the price of the CD's to be reasonable.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|great movie overall!!! excellent weapon of choice.........lol. I will be reading the book asap!!! I look forward to more movies like this one!!!
B009RH9FR6|1.0|Says it only fits Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; but was too big when it came.  It does not close and doesnt swivel freely.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Love this game! I've played through it twice now! No negative comments here! I was very excited to see this as a free app. Finally a app of the day that was worth trying.
0345505387|1.0|While I like this author, I discovered I hated the graphic style.  Not for me at all! I can't imagine why I didn't know that already, but I certainly do now.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfers is a nice game for kids and I enjoy it also. Inflicted a lot and it gets on my nerves a lot.
B006X08FDA|4.0|Gives a little insight to music of the past from the black perspective. Good music for those interested in the progression of music of the south during this time period.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book pulled me in immediately!  I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking about the characters and frequently would stay up to read more!  It was fiction based on fact, so I really enjoyed learning about the relationships between the master and the house slaves as well as the interactions between the house and field slaves.  Much of it was hard to read due to the abuse by the master's son and the overseer of the slaves, but I grew to love the mistess of the house and the slaves she loved.  It was a lesson on perseverance and love.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It held my interest to the point that I had trouble putting it down. I found it to be a good, fast paced read.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|game is ok but its the second edition not the first one that came out back in the day, like the one in the arcade when the wheel shakes when you crash.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|i loved the book. the part about the guy being her teacher was a little predictable. i could see that coming before it happened. the part about her mom was a shock to me though. I'm starting the second one now!:)
B0091W5UWG|5.0|Whitney was great. Kevin Costner was excellent.  The movie brings back memories of a very young and successful Whitney Houston and Costner was super.  It is a good combination of action and romance.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Dr. Who is something I watched as a kid and now as an adult I am getting caught up on the updated version on Amazon streaming. I watch and episode per workout on the treadmill and it's a great way to pass time!
0307887448|4.0|This book is about a quest for 80's pop culture knowledge on music, video games, and movies in a virtual world set in 2041. OASIS is an online world created by a recluse video game genius, Haliday.  Haliday being obsessed with the 80's, realizes he dying, and makes a quest in the viral world for control of OASIS and all of his vast fortune.  Their are gunters who are true to the quest and create a counter culture of their own obsessed with 80's folklore and then their's IOI also known as the sixes who want to make money and profit off OASIS who's free to everyone, to enjoy. You do have to pay for teleportation and other various things, but it is accessible to everyone.<br /><br />What's cool about this book is the all the references, it's reminded me a lot about my grade school experiences when we discuss movies and music back in the late eighties.  It made me revisit War Games the movie, it made me listen to the Ladyhawke soundtrack and Rush's 2112. This is what's cool about the book the story is still good, and the book goes places that I didn't think it would go.  There are slow parts like after the gang solves the first puzzle, then the story slows to a crawl, but when the quest picks back up the story gets good and has an amazing finale.<br /><br />The dialogue is weak in some areas and often redundant, but his descriptions of the world reality and OASIS worlds are truly great, I found it very easy to picture everything that was going on very easily.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to most of my friends, I think this is a good starter book for people that don't read, people that love Godzilla and Ultraman, there's a huge payoff.
B00AN0KBJC|2.0|The series is excellent but I could not watch it because it kept pausing.  It made viewing difficult.  I don't know if it is a settings issue but I could not find any help
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, and season 3 does not disappoint!  The relationships and story development, this show is about much more than zombies!  Even if you aren't a zombie nut, you will love this show!
B009FZFONO|5.0|While this show is not for everyone, it certainly has something for everyone. This show is the purest form of e-crack out there, and it is wicked awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great way to not be bored when your at home or have nothing to do. It`s a great game you should play it once in a while.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Great effects.  Awesome queen.  Pretty good movie :)  I would watch it again and recommend it.  Blah blah blah blah....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's an in between stuff game, something to do when you're bored, or waiting. Don't like the new Valentine's day background though.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The lower levels of this game are real easy the mid levels are challenging for the mind.  It's a good time waster.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't book the book down. Suzanne Collins really knows how to keep you interested. I can't wait for the movie.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Worked perfectly to attach my iPad to my flatscreen during a recent hospital stay. It was great to be relieved of the stock programming.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Of all the books the books I have ever read none have touched the very core of my soul the way this one has.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This will quickly become a family favorite and holiday tradition!  Wonderful remake of an old story line that crosses generations!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had read a review recently saying this season was dull and all about happy endings. Well first off -- nothing could be farther from the truth, lots of plot twists and some heart-wrenching sad endings. Besides, is there something wrong with drama that brings a bit of joy to entertainment?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nifty app, and I can actually see it without my glasses. Keep on improving it..<br />I will definitely be buying the paid app.<br />Wattsaia
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|. . . now should contain Skyfall. This is the best Bond film in years (it may be THE best Bond film, I'd have to think on that a while). Some of the longer reviews here will give you some reasons why you should at least give this one a try or a buy. Typically, Bond films are chock full of gizmos and other deus ex machina do-dads that they seem almost cartoonish.<br /><br />Not so this Bond -- Q (a new Q, BTW) offers Bond nothing more than a pistol and the spy-equivalent of On*Star to be used if he gets into distress. The rest of the film, although full of action, seems to actually have more than superficial depth, exploring somewhat the issues that come with age -- although Bond does get off a good line when he says something to the effect: \\"Youth does not gaurantee innovation!\\"<br /><br />If you loved many of the previous Bond's with their many impossible toys, you may not care for this one since it goes light on made-up technology to bail Bond out.  Further, more time is spent in conveying meaning rather than simply displaying how far special effects have progressed (but there are special effects that should satisfy most.)<br /><br />This is one of the 100 discs I'd take with me were I to be exiled to an island in the middle of nowhere.  Just don't ask me, yet, to name the movie I'd drop in order to make room for Skyfall . . .
1419701533|5.0|Purchased for my grandson for christimas he loved them. Its nice that the books are available it encourages reading. I recommend
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I've heard the movie is nothing like this so I'm not going to see it, though I love Bradley Cooper.  The book, however, is awesome.  I was surprised by how much I liked it.
B004DM0UII|4.0|The best part of this app is that you can set an alarm to go off and play your favorite streaming website.
141694737X|5.0|I originally got this book for my baby nephew.  It's his favorite.  If he's fussy, I just start reciting it for him.  So I bought a second copy to give to a friend who's having a baby in the spring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My children, who range from 5 years old to 11, all LOVE this app. What a great idea and pretty funny at times. Five stars *****
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The English episodic programs are wonderful!<br />They are so engrossing. The fact that Downton Abbey was filmed in an actual country home just makes it feel like you are there.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I think the other reviewers have nailed the description here, so I'm not sure how much more I can add to the reviews. (However the additional 5 Star review definitely helps).<br /><br />This book is fantastic for all IT Managers, (and actually for non-managers too IMHO). It is written from the perspective of a newly minted VP of IT Operations and written like a fiction novel rather than a drab management manual, but the senarios are VERY real.  The IT Ops team has been so busy figthing fires, it has barely any time to do the planning and proper execution for a gigantic \\"company saving\\" project called the Phoenix Project. The plot goes on to show how the management finally manages to streamline IT operations and IT development by applying manufacturing/plant operations principles to IT.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Makes for entertaining reading while teaching key IT management principles!
0425252868|5.0|Heard a review of this book on NPR...knew my husband would love it.  He could hardly put it down once he started reading and he is not really a reader.  Yup, it was a good one!!
B009E9R1IM|5.0|I am really glad I purchased these LP Vinyls. The performances are amazing and the recording quality as well. If you are a huge Led Zeppelin fan or would like to hear how they sound live, this is a great way to do both.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have learned so much about that time in history and love how the author has developed the characters.  I have had difficulty putting it down and then when I finished I had to get the next one!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a good read, moved at a quick pace, plenty of twists to keep the reader from wanting to put the book down.  Though at times I was annoyed that Katniss  comes off like a major brat.  I would recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Second in the trilogy, I am grieving a little because I am almost done with it and now I have to wait for the next one.<br />That is a happy problem!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I love Rebus and this was a great 'come-back' novel. A great road-trip book, especially if you have travelled in that area
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a wonderfully great story and the clothing and setting are marvelous.  It seems like a great social commentary for the times.  As well as being provocative for our own times.
B000UJ48O0|4.0|I really like the oc so was happy to get it at a good price, only problem was that the case it was in was a little damaged.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This app has good graphics, response time is good, and the story is engaging.  The puzzles get a little repetitive, but overall, the game is a good time-killer.
B007Y612KA|4.0|Liked the way the movie simulated a comic book while providing some fun action.  Acting was ok, not Oscar material, but fun.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I think the play is ok except for the fact you cannot drop as many coins as you want or have. Game tells you how many.
8866130907|3.0|Not what we expected but it is okay.  Wife uses it like a diary and does have enough space to jot down the highlites of the days.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I always like Nelson DeMille and I especially like his John Corey character.  This book moved a little slow, but was a good story.
0307593312|5.0|Written by a Japanese author, the writing style is refreshing and new to me. The book itself is very absorbing, and although it's quite a thick book, I LOVED it. The elements of fantasy and suspense draw you into the book along with getting to know the cultural mindset of Japan. I liked it a lot.
B006LSZECO|1.0|For a while, it held my interest, but then it began to skip from one improbable situation to another, and the ending was ridiculous and unbelievable. Also felt the writing was stilted.
1878424319|5.0|My Hopi Elder in the Medicine Circle I have attended recommended this book 6 years ago and I have bought numerous copies to give out to friends.  A very practical spirituality and approach to life's issues!
B00846F1YW|4.0|Nice to find a game t hat you don't have to tell. Everyone that you are playing.<br />Good story and you can bypass if you want.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|There have been too many instances when my normal music device has a drained battery and I've got nothing to listen to on my too-long daily commute, except for the loud talkers. That was the case until I installed Amazon MP3 on my 'droid phone. Now I can drown out those who don't use their inside voices on the commuter train.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I don't know why I purchased this because I really don't need it. I have a weather guide already installed, a better one.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I will be very interested to see how part 2 turns out in the movie, I was however disappointed when I come to the realization that they almost didn't follow the book at all considering that in the book there's 3 parts not just 2! But it was a very good ending that has inticed me to look into the exending versions out there. Now reading: The second Life of Bree Tanner.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I'm trying to access some of the features like font size/color and the like, but when I hit the buttons nothing happens. What am I doing wrong? I realize that I wasn't doing it right. It works fine now that I've figured it out.
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|I wanted a home run and got a double instead. This film should not have been split up! Too bad!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|A fine performance from Denzel Washington and a riveting airplane sequence made this movie perfect fare for the weekend.  Didn't need the woman-degraded aspect of the film, so weary of that sub-plot.  Otherwise it was very entertaining.
B00633W614|5.0|I was totally hooked on this story before I was 10% in.  It is a real page turner.  Characters are well developed.  A great read.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The Blu-ray of 'Skyfall' has about one-hour of special feature short-documentaries that you can choose to watch individually or together. It also has two commentaries: one by Director Sam Mendes, the other by Producers Michael G Wilson & Barbara Broccoli (along with the production designer). The documentaries are interesting, but its clear they've held back on what could have been included as special features to make part of a future release of a \\"Deluxe Double-O\\" Special Edition.<br /><br />The DVD has no special features, and is just the movie with an iTunes (off the disc) and Ultraviolet digial copy (off the internet).<br /><br />As a movie, it is amazing, and certainly the best Bond movie in over a decade. Daniel is not my favorite actor to play Bond, and in his first two movies his performance was not \\"Bondian\\" enough (but neither were the movies, as a whole). Even Daniel recognized this, as he's acknolwedged in interviews for Skyfall, that he wanted to incorporate more humor and recognizable elements of the formula back into the franchise. In his previous films, just wearing a tux and saying \\"Bond, James Bond\\" were insufficient in convincing me the action movie i was watching was truly a Bond action movie. Daniel spent his first two outings looking miserable and pissed at everyone; now he is actually enjoying the part, even smiling. I don't think it was so-much that it's taken him three movies to become comfortable in the role, as instead the first two movies were written this way, making the character perpetually angry.<br /><br />The smartest decision Skyfall made was in being proud that James Bond is \\"old fashioned\\". There is not only a place for him in present day, but a need. The film has scene-after-scene where Bond's relevence in today's world is questioned. The argument made by the film, especially in it's final 90 minutes, is 'just because something is old, doesn't mean its outlived its usefulness.'
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think the game is very... what's the word skill like game. you haft to have a lot of finger skills tho.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. I could put myself in Abbys shoes and loved Travis as much as she did!!! Didn't want it to end!
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|Definitly a new take on what they have but set the world on fire is something worth buying from BVB!

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Only HBO could pull this off. If lik this show look for the Wire: Ionly wished they had not killed off Sean Bean.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was well written but still contained some of the same old language as others of its ilk. The author gave too many hints not to guess the ending.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|A fun movie for the entire family.  A good mix of humor about family life and how to live in this world!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Our grandson rolls it all over the yard and has a wonderful look of authenticity about it. We will definately buy more Bruder trucks for his collection.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Much the same as in theatres. Samsara's blu ray is a must have for all film connoisseurs. Visually captivating and thought-provoking as any film I have seen before.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It seems easy at first, too easy even.  The farther one goes in the game the trickier it gets. Good job.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great read<br />Wonderful composition by Jeff Kinney that made me laugh and relate to some of the things I face in middle school
B001EN71CW|5.0|It's hard to imagine a show better than star trek: TNG, but firefly succeeded. I'm not a fan of westerns yet love the western flare.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|I got this thinking it was a comedy. But it's not funny at all. It's just weird. I got bored and stopped watching after about 30 minutes.
0345534379|5.0|Great fun. My daughter loves to read it. It came fast..fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.

1592407889|1.0|Well, I must say that the reviews here are passionate, though I will have to agree with the reviews that take a skeptical look at the truthfulness of the stories in the book.<br />On the positive side, I thought that it was interesting, and there were some funny moments, even some touching ones.<br />Having said that though, I didn't really enjoy it because throughout the book I felt that the stories were, as another reviewer said, \\"fantastical\\", embellished, and most of the funny moments were at someone else's expense, which makes them in my opinion, not funny. I too had a problem believing the whole \\"older prostitute\\" story, the airplane ticket story and I also had a hard time believing that Shirley MacLaine would spend so much calculated time trying to sabotage her daughter's career.<br />There were many themes running through the book for me and one was about lying...Ms. Parker getting caught in and accused of...another was Ms. Parker's seemingly desperate need to be a famous actress...and another was money...mostly the lack of and why won't her mother give her some. I like to observe and listen to what people are saying on the surface, but also to what they are saying beneath the surface and those themes were a red flag for me.<br />There was also what I felt was a mean spirited and sarcastic delivery of the negative Shirley MacLaine stories. To me it felt like the author was getting a lift from telling most of these stories rather than heartache.<br />Before reading the book, my red flags were already activated having watched Ms. Parker's interviews on both 20/20 and CNN. As I watched the first of those interviews, what struck me as strange is that in my own opinion, if you truly love and want to \\"protect\\" someone, which is what Ms. Parker claims in regards to her mother, then you do not publish stores like that even IF they are true! But, it was the CNN interview that really got me wondering. Ms. Parker seemed flustered at times and I noticed that in the 20/20 interview she said that the last time she spoke to her mother was in the summer and when asked on CNN, she said it was December.<br />Why is this important? Because Shirley MacLaine says that her daughter's statements about her are \\"dishonest\\" and \\"virtually all fiction\\". Why would I believe her statement? I don't have any reason not to. Shirley MacLaine has never been afraid of sharing her life stories and adventures that have put her in a place of possible public ridicule. I really don't think that Shirley MacLaine cares what people think of her....as long as it is the truth. I think that her public statement shows class and dignity, and unfortunately Steve Parker is no longer with us to defend himself.<br />At the end of the CNN interview, Ms. Parker says something like, \\"I only hope that my mother understands that this is \\"my truth\\" and then she very quickly changed it to, \\"THE truth\\". I think that she has inherited her mother and uncle's talent for drama and storytelling. Unfortunately, she did not seem to inherit their class and integrity.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it's on my laptop and my kindle. I play for hours. It's not complicated and my kids love it.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Love it and that sums it up.  It arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged. I hate writing these reviews.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a real page turner! Each time I thought I had figured the author out and &#34;knew&#34; what must be coming, the writer took it in another direction. I loved the full circle of the story line, and found the ending very interesting. I definitely recommend this to the mature reader.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Game is way too short to pay for. Though it was fun while it lasted. Needs many more levels to be worth the money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a great game. I like it much more than the first. My kids like it better too.
B00B8PMWJI|1.0|Movie was super lame. Some letters were good or funny but for the most part it was lame. Good idea but still lame
B0037VNX44|3.0|Well done by Tom Hardy. He is a big time up and coming actor. His toughness and psychological ferocity bleeds out in this movie.
B00846F1YW|5.0|best hidden object and mystery game that is free! very interesting and captivates your attention! love love love love love
B001AITGWE|4.0|Michael Douglas makes losing it artistic as he tries to cope with his failed family demons and economic struggles with being trapped as an introvert in an overwhelmingly changing world. Robert Duvall plays the classy cop as he juggles with being a great husband and a dedicated member of the law enforcement community.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Such an awesome story and an amazing ending. Riveting. I started this book because I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. Then I heard that many had said the book was \\"unfilmable\\".  Now, I can't wait to see the movie because the book was unbelievable (especially the conclusion)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This app, along with many more from this developer, will not download onto the Cruz Tablet. This really disappoints me, because I enjoy playing this game. If it would download, it would be great..Compatiblity would be great, too.<br />- Disappointed.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|kept going to the instructions no matter how many times i opened it up and trying to get me to upgrade then when i finally tought i had it set up it failed to go off!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its ok but needs some more activity's. and feeding the horse cinima is sillly. I would like to customize the horse
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It was a innovative take on the Zombie story.  Couple of loose ends for my on why the zombies were eating non-humans and if so why did the animals not become infected.  Also the zombies at the bottom of the ocean I would assume would have their bones crushed by the pressure of the water.  Over all fun story and the individual interviews worked as interwoven short stories.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Love American Horror Story,the first season is a must see! So many twists and turns and crazy characters. I was dying to know how all the stories were going to resolve and go. Keeps you guessing for sure. Definitely recommend!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great story and great characters.  The reader must suspend expectations of reality in order to thoroughly enjoy this book.  I saw similarities between this book's fantasy story and many real lifeHollywood star stories as well as our American athlete stories.

B000TERG6S|5.0|Great compilation of all around great music. Full of variety in composition & instruments. Not your average gypsy guitar music.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|My sister turned me on to this app. The process is fun and any age could do it. One person draws and sends it to the other person to guess. Depending on your drawing ability (mine is awful) players fill in the word that describes what you drew.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Good book I extremely enjoyed it now I want to go see the movie.<br /><br />The hunger games<br />Catching fire<br />Mockingjay<br /><br />All in one volume I am sure to read more of this author's work as well as watch the movie!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|If you are not a fan of the new Batman, you should be.  This is a great movie and very stunning in BR.  We love this movie, but I warn you that it is a bit dark.  It is not the Saturday morning Batman.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Enjoyed him throughout the show - American Idol and he has been the one true singer since Kelly, Carrie and Chris Daughtry to bring something out that sounds like a true artist.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was resistent to watching this series, but decided to see what the hype is about.  I love that it offers quality acting as well as accurate historical references.  Well done Masterpiece Theatre!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a pretty good book, a page turner at times.  A little too much on the sex side but a necessary I guess for the plot.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|I gave this a one, if there was a zero I would have given it a zero because I ordered a two disc platinum edition I got one disc and it was bonus features. I tried contacting the seller and no one has gotten back to me. I feel ripped off.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Christmas present for twin Grand girls.  They love storing their doll cloths in the bin and then being able to use the playmat.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game!  It helps pass the time at doctor's offices and I am looking forward to using it this summer at my beach house.
B009FZFONO|3.0|I love the Walking Dead & the 3rd season has been fantastic after the second one dragged. But I'm dinging it two stars because Amazon's streaming has sometimes been patchy, & they still, after all this time, do not provide closed captions.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|It sounded interesting but you could get lost and disinterested in the story wading through all the technical stuff!Too bad!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very exciting and fun. I enjoyed Ana's journey. I will recommend this book to all my friends. I usually never finish a book and I read this one in eight days which is a first for me. It was great.
1616614609|5.0|Simply put, Netrunner is the most fun I've had playing a card game in a long time.  The player interaction and the amount of hidden information force you to play your opponent, which contrasts with many other deckbuilding card games in which you simply play your deck for most of the time.<br /><br />The one downside for newer players is that the rules can probably be daunting at first.  I would recommend a tutorial video to anyone who isn't already familiar with this type of card game.  I think that once you know how to play though, you will find it a rich and rewarding experience.
B005LAII80|5.0|It is too bad that this movie did not do well in the theater.  It is very interesting take on the original comic.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson writes as if Robert Jordan was sitting at his elbow.  Fantastic conclusion to the series.  It wraps up the wheel of Time leaving enough undone for a sequel.  It makes you want more and more and more.......

B002NUULNG|3.0|For such a classic anime to be upgraded in a less than stellar way is quite sad, I say this in comparison to the Evangelion series of upgrades which are flawless.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Wish they had a sesion three... This was very good can't stop watching it ... It really gets in depth
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I can't believe I held off on buying this but I've owned the complete DVD series for years and thought &#34;how much difference could there be?&#34; well, it turns out quite a lot. It's almost like reexpereincing the entire amazing story in hyper vivid flawlessly fluid alternate universe.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I had not really paid attention to The Black Keys before, I saw them on the Grammy's. bought the album the next day and have not stop listening to it. I have even played some of the songs during free work time in my class.  The kids love them too!

0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain has written an insightful and practical book highlighting the power of introverts in Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.  This is an excellent resource for both introverts and extroverts.  If you are an introvert this book will provide insight and realization of your strengths and if you are an extrovert it will help you to understand and appreciate the strengths of introverts.<br /><br />All of us have aspects of both introversion and extroversion in our personality but most people have a preference.  Introverts are drawn to their inner world of thought and feeling whereas extroverts prefer the external world of people and activities.  Susan Cain chronicles that we have departed from a \\"Culture of Character\\" to a \\"Culture of Personality\\" celebrating the personality type of the extrovert at the expense of the introvert.  Her TED talk, The Power of Introverts, provides a good overview of the content of the book.  A Reading Group Guide has been prepared to process the information from Quiet.<br /><br />The book contains helpful \\"A Manifesto for Introverts\\":<br /><br />1. There's a word for \\"people who are in their heads too much\\":  thinkers.<br />2. Our culture rightly admires risk-takers, but we need our \\"heed-takers\\" more than ever.<br />3. Solitude is a catalyst for innovation.<br />4. Texting is popular because in an overly extroverted society, everyone craves asynchronyous, non-F2F communication.<br />5. We teach kids in group classrooms not because this is the best way to learn but because it's cost-efficient, and what else would we do with the children while all the grown-ups are at work? If your child prefers to work autonomously and socialize one-on-one, there's nothing wrong with her; she just happens not to fit the model.<br />6. The next generation of quiet kids can and should be raised to know their own strength.<br />7. Sometimes it helps to be a pretend-extrovert. There's always time to be quiet later.<br />8. But in the long run, staying true to your temperament is the key to finding work you love and work that matters.<br />9. Everyone shines, given the right lighting. For some, it's a Broadway spotlight, for others, a lamp lit desk.<br />10. Rule of thumb for networking events: one genuine new relationship is worth a fistful of business cards.<br />11. It's OK to cross the street to avoid making small talk.<br />12. \\"Quiet leadership\\" is not an oxymoron.<br />13. The universal longing for heaven is not about immortality so much as the wish for a world in which everyone is always kind.<br />14. If the task of the first half of life is to put yourself out there, the task of the second half is to make sense of where you've been.<br />15. Love is essential, gregariousness is optional.<br />16. \\"In a gentle way, you can shake the world.\\" - Gandhi<br /><br />Anaïs Nin wisely observes,<br /><br />\\"Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.\\"<br /><br />As an extrovert I have found this book helpful for enabling me to be sensitive to the introverts in my life.  Jesus modeled the strengths of introverts as we see His desire for solitude and prayer,<br /><br />In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there.  (Mark 1:35)<br /><br />This book is helpful for enabling you to celebrate your strengths and recognize your corresponding weaknesses.  (I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review).ut in the long run, staying true to your temperament is the key to finding work you love and work that matters.<br />9.

Love is essential, gregariousness is optional.<br />16. \\"In a gentle way, you can shake the world.\\" - Gandhi<br /><br />Anaïs Nin wisely observes,<br /><br />\\"Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.\\"<br /><br />As an extrovert I have found this book helpful for enabling me to be sensitive to the introverts in my life.  Jesus modeled the strengths of introverts as we see His desire for solitude and prayer,<br /><br />In the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and was praying there.  (Mark 1:35)<br /><br />This book is helpful for enabling you to celebrate your strengths and recognize your corresponding weaknesses.  (I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review).
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good graphics with lots of options and different playing levels. I've used this game for years on my iPhone and never get bored.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Another purchase for my teenage daughter to share the &#34;horror&#34; I loved so much as a teen.  Subsequent Phantasm movies can't hold a candle to it.
B003TEFFT0|5.0|Such a brilliant book, for those interested in weaponry, the armed forces and tactics, i really reccomend reading this book, and for those who have already read it, read it again. Worth it!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My kids watch Lion King often.  Very good movie good for all ages. A little sad in some parts of the movie.
B00A77II0U|2.0|I think this game should be recommended for those who have played this type of game before.  I know I'm not the brightest bulb in the pkg. but I can't get past Chapter 1!!!!  At the very end it says to tap anywhere on the screen to watch the movie, but I've tapped everywhere and no movie!!!  I'm finished with it before I get started.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|My kids loved this movie.  I did not get to watch the whole movie with them.  They are 4 and 5 and really liked it.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed Sheeran is the best. His music is so fabulous. There are a few songs I wasn't as keen on, but the songs I loved were WELL worth it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG I can not wait to read the final book. Incredible - spectacular - amazing! A must read. An easy read. A page turner.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This album is so much fun! All the songs are super catchy and I enjoy singing along in my car. It's probably they're most fun album yet.
0525953728|5.0|this was a gift he read it the day he got it and could not put it down. thank you
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Alcoholic drinks, does wrong, seeks redemption. Yeah!!<br /><br />Get over it!!  Go to rehab!!<br />This is tired, same old crap and waste of film and money!!<br />I used to like Denzel but seems his career is over so he sells this crap!!<br /><br />Total waste of time!!!  Unless you're a drunk seeking redemption!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|received quickly thank you, anxious to try it just bought a new tv and this looked like the best 3D movie to get
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Truthfully, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It was my husbands pick and I thought it would be stupid and ridiculous. However, I did laugh out lout on several occasions.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book! Great story and easy read. First book in a while that I actually finished. Not a depressing ending.
B00AMS4YVQ|3.0|The CD works fine and it's the edited version that I prefer but I have not been able to play the video.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It is a copy of mine craft so why get it i know there is birds and other animals but mine craft still beats it.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love this movie....I would watch it again...and again...the quality of  the movie from this site was very good I had no problem downloading it
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|A movie was , in my opinion, lacking realism regarding a flight officer who was an alcoholic and drug user.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I liked the mad panther, but it was not as good as the other books so in your face and bye bye
B005LAIIHG|1.0|The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it recreates the experience of sea sickness without actually being on the water... The intense nausea that will come from watching this movie on a big screen (and in 3D) will distract nicely from the intense boredom that would otherwise be experienced.<br /><br />Had to leave early as I couldn't take it anymore, I'm aware there is some twist at the end (and I also know what it is) it however in no way makes this movie any more bearable or watchable...
B00006I53S|3.0|It has auto focus problem on my 5d2. Sometimes it try and try and can not get the focus forever......
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|There are lots of screens, everytime I think I have reached the end there is a new twist and more HO to find.  Worth the money!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it needs to give u more coins its a great game everybody needs to try it
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love playing this game its fantastic, I would recommend it to everybody! Im a grandma and never thought I would like a game like this
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great story from the master!  I enjoyed the way the plot moved and how the author surprised me once again  with the final conclusion.  I wait with anticipation for John Grisham's next book.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its too hard for me and its a little frightening that a gorilla is chasing me, but my son and grandkids love it and spend hours playing it. I would recommend it to young adults and teenagers
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This is a really smart show that goes beyond the cool scifi action and explores deeper issues. The episode we watched last night explored the issue of torture: is it every okay?  is it okay to withhold pain medicine to get someone to talk?  Is it okay to return someone to their enemy if you know they will be tortured?  Challenging, in a good way!
B00564GPKY|5.0|Absolutely love the way this book blends neuropsychology, behavioural plans and great stories. I recommend this book for business people, health professionals and anyone wanting to make changes in their own lives.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I found this book to be an engaging read.  The integration of history was fascinating as well as educational.  The plot twists kept a rapid pace and held my interest.  The science, while bordering on true science-fiction still held the story together well and leaves the reader thirsting for me.  I definitely recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is amazeballs  it is addicting and very fun I love it and p.s.I'm addicted to saying amazeballs I love it it's glorious and ally willbanks is a idiot
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Finally they are getting it right.....the way Ian Fleming wrote his James Bond...and Daniel Craig is spot on.  This film is brilliant...an end...a beginning...can't wait for the next one!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Works great. Only used it in a trial situation. I guess it will work if I need it. Retired, so I don;t really need an alarm clock. Better to be prepared in case I do.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Complex and engaging and addictive!  Love this series.  Hope Amazon gets Season Three soon - I am waiting not so patiently.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Only used it in a trial situation. I guess it will work if I need it. Retired, so I don;t really need an alarm clock. Better to be prepared in case I do.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I love P. Cornwell books, but this one isn't up to the her usual stuff.  Not sure why, just not as intriging as her past books.  Would still recommend, but hoping next book out is back to her usual stuff.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I keep it on my Kindal's screen for instant diagnosis of my battery. Nice app. (Five more words required to submit).
B005KITL16|5.0|LEGO - always a great item!  Received a little before stated which is always nice - made my nephew very happy!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Nice product, but it takes a little getting used to. Does not work like MS Word thouigh. I have trouble with hyperlinks, but that is probably my fault, not the program.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|How is it that some low-rent Glee clone rates five stars? Because it's not, of course. Written by a 30 Rock alum (and with a college-age Tina Fey stand in as the lead), Pitch Perfect plays more like John Hughes with musical numbers. Good ones. Go for the hilarious ensemble cast, all of whom are funny, but stay for the surprisingly effective teen love story, and be prepared to hate yourself for how much fun you're having. Take that, Zero Dark Sucky.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|We liked Season 2. Fascinating insight into the class system of the time and how the servants could be more snobby and bigoted than the &#34;upstairs&#34; family.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I do like this CD.<br /><br />I was hoping for a few more of my favorite songs though.<br /><br />All in all - I am glad I bought this item
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved the book. Its something different and not all sex. It has a life story. I love the way he totally loves and want to protect her.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|While this show may be quite fabricated it is definitely entertaining. This is a time period that has always peaked my interest do I was happy to see it available free on Prime as I do not get any of the pay movie channels on TV.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I love Bejeweled and this is an excellent Kindle game.  Classic Bejeweled will always be the best but I liked both the mineral and arcade games too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was a pleasure to have the chance to see such a good Show through the web on Amazon.com  .  Thank you.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|another great Jack Reacher book, sooooo much better than watching Tom Cruise attempting and failing to be Jack. Hope he doesn't do another one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG I could not put this series of books down!!! WOW !! I want more from this series & the writer . She is wonderful !!! Come write more !
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Thought it was going to be a &#34;girly&#34; book, however great read.<br /><br />Loved the character depth and how your feelings for them change so dramatically
0790729342|5.0|Grandson loved it, uncle loved it, I remembered it well.....loved it
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Everyone from parents to kids ages 5 through 11 LOVED it!!!!! This is very funny and entertaining :)  We would watch it again!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an outstanding showing on Masterpiece theatre..and wish everyone could enjoy this..<br />so seldom we get such quallity<br />So classic
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This turns out to be a really useful app to have on my kindle fire hd. One can select from an infinite number of colors and easily adjust the brightness. At its brightest the light is comparable to that of a fluorescent bulb.  It is far superior to the light from an ebook! Above all, the price is right!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has another hit, enjoyed the read and looking forward to the movie in a few years.  Love, anger, new relationship makes life.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I agree with a previous reviewer, directv and cable just steal your money that's why I rather buy the shows and can watch them whenever I want, for tv well I bought this antenna from Mohu I bough the leaf model and is superb, mohu is a company that makes antennas for free tv and I was impressed, here in Las Vegas, NV I get over 40 HD channels for free, the antenna was like $40 bucks or so, I'm never paying for cable ever again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Addicting! Much better graphics than the first version. Hard to put down. Still trying for 10,000,000 meters run. Fun for the whole family.
B0040GR01M|5.0|The funny thing about One-X is that I know almost all the songs, but never knew they were all on the same album.  Pandora Hard Rock Radio apparently loves this album, and that's what clued me in.  So even though it's 6-7 years old at this point I figured I should buy it.  And right now it's only $2.99 so that sealed the deal.  Again, a GREAT album that I can listen to all the way through from front to back.
B001VDJ5PG|5.0|When Harry Met Sally is my all time favorite chick flick.  When I am sick in bed and feeling a bit depressed, this is my go to film for comfort. Four Weddings and a Funeral, number 2 all time fun favorite.  Say Anything is a welcome bonus.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Had a good price for two DVD's, one was blue ray and the other was a regular DVD.  Very happy with the product and price!
0061339202|5.0|I learned the importance of flow, various areas of life where we experience flow, and who to get more of it.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Interesting and fun project software.  Kept my mind alert<br />Would recommend it to both adults and children of elementary school age.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I haven't had any problems, no glitches or bugs, just smooth operation and accurate results. Plus it's free lol so yeah it's all good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is great for short, fun play while waiting.  Both my husband and myself are addicted to the game. Will probably buy the full game
B0063IH60K|2.0|The play logic is not customer friendly and not enjoyable for very long, I like to play basic  solitaire every so often.
1599290642|5.0|I purchased Spectrum 19 because my son's art appears on page 251. I am very please to say the book has amazing art in it submitted by about 300 artists from all over the world. I have looked through the book cover to cover and placed it on my coffeetable. I would suggest this book to all art lovers.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is a very interesting character, this author spends considerale time and effort in explaining most every aspect of his charactor and situations.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|A great revelation of the primary influences running the White House. Democracy is dead. How can I get one of those jobs on Wall Street? I want a new 'cottage' in the Hamptons.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Game works just fine, you don't have to post on FB or Twitter. If you enjoy Hidden object games, with a couple other small games included, try this game.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The first half hour or so is amazing. The rest of the movie went by at a bit slower pace, but continued to entertain. All-around, very good movie.<br /><br />I think Krispy Kreme says it best: &#34;Denzel Washington, the best actor ever. He's so darn cool, he's so darn clever. I think that you're the man, and Mike does too. Denzel, if you want, you can join our crew.&#34;
B002RI9UBS|5.0|A fascinating book which is very different from other books that I have read. The twist at the end makes this book much more real and adds a darker element to it. Well worth a read,
B007HU7NBK|4.0|This was a very good read indeed. I especially liked how JT spoke so sweetly of his parents at a time when so many celebrities blame their folks for their own bad choices in life. He did not slam anyone as far as I could tell, not even the ex-wife. I think it would be interesting if JT and Gela would write a book on blended families.
B008D30K7E|4.0|If you like Tom Sharpe you will probably like this. I love the way that world politics was simplified to the level of a game. It lost a star only because it was a little too long for me- but a fab read, all in all
0525952926|5.0|Heavest book I ever tried to read...I'm still not finished with it...but I love it as I love all of Ken Follett's books!!  It really is a history lesson and not to be read quickly...of course, at 900 plus pages, you can't read it quickly anyway!!!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I have read all of Gillian Flynn`s novels now and she is twistedly amazing. This book was surprising and shocking waiting for more from her.
0451232852|5.0|Great book.  I read it much more quickly than I'm reading Winter of the World.  I like almost anything Follett writes.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I was very unhappy with this product.  I thought it would help syncing with my office computer, but it didn't.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Very unique and a little weird at times, but had amazing acting and a great message. Emma Watson was absolutely electrifying throughout the film.
0307744434|5.0|Once and a while, a book comes along that just sweeps you off your feet.  &#34;Night Circus&#34; is a wonderfully magical book that creates a world in which the reader just aches to belong.  This book is an exemplary example of love, magic, and sacrifice all rolled into a circus.  I hope that you will enjoy this book as much as I did, there is nothing like falling into a world of magic and never wanting to leave.  The longing to be apart of this circus has stayed with me months after finishing the book and is what keeps me coming back to reread the book time after time.<br /><br />This book has inducted me into the society of the rêveurs, and I will always wear a red flower on my soul.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Didn't care for It thought it was kind of silly. Wish I could figure out how to delete it off my kindle fire
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first the boards are fast and easy. Than as you think you are getting real good at the games it becomes much more challenging. Thoroughly enjoy the challenge.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My boys promised I would like the Angry Birds Games.<br />They were right I is a real fun game top play<br />once you get started you can't stop.<br />I even have some angry Bird shirt I ware to work
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Graphics are great, with bright colors and designs. Response is excellent, I run this on my Kindle Fire and my HTC Incredible 4G phone with perfect touch on both. Wonderful time killer and mind relaxer.
B005HSL626|3.0|it's an ok game .I Guess if you like slashing fruit and such<br />Sorry But it is not Angy Birds
B006VRLNV6|5.0|This album is fantastic; I personally think it is one of their best, but aren't all of The Doors' albums?<br />A good buy from Amazon MP3, as well: 5$ for two-disc 40th Anniversary is an awesome deal.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|By boys promised I would like  Angry Birds, and thy are right .<br />It's A very fun game It's hard to put down once you get started.<br />and  easy to lose track of time when your playing.<br />best game ever
0385737955|5.0|Not remembering anything but his own name, Thomas wakes in the lift surrounded by boys. He doesn't know how or why he's there. He couldn't even remember what he was doing before he got there.<br />There. The Glade was a large area encased with prodigious stonewalls. The boys were once just as perplexed as Thomas was when they first arrived at the Glade. All they knew was that behind the walls that would open and close every night, lay the complex Maze and that every thirty days a new boy would make his way to through the lift and into the Glade.<br />The Gladers knew Thomas was coming but what they didn't expect was for a girl would come through the lift the next day. The very first girl to enter the Glade. She was a holding a note it said something that surprised everyone, even Thomas. They had always thought the maze was meant to be solved but now the Gladers aren't so sure.<br />Thomas feels connected to the girl though he doesn't know why. He feels as though he can help everyone escape if only he can find the memories he lost.<br /><br />I love this book because it's so suspenseful and filled with twists and turns. Every chapter ends with a sentence that just makes me want to read more. I just love this book! 5 stars!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|There is not a lot to say about Angry Birds but my boys have  got me  hooked on it<br />I sure lose track of time when I play the game But I love it
B00846F1YW|4.0|This  game is easy to follow and is not confusing. You can follow the story or zip through it and get going. I have played a lot of games and  I like the pictures because they are  easy to follow.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|I was very excited to get this game I'm like pin ball<br />All I can say about this pin ball  game is don't wast your time it not worth it.
B0078XGEK2|4.0|The author has done very good job in explaining the drive in decision making, and our &#34;subconscious&#34; decision to be who we are. Very clear and precise, and easy to grasp even for those without psychology background.
B009IK5UVC|1.0|I can't believe I spent $18 on this remaster. This is supposed to be A SPECIAL EDITION CD REMASTER, but the fidelity is so horrible. It sounds like they attempted to make a \\"modern,\\" \\"extra-loud\\" version but they obliterated all the magic and soul of the original recordings. I am frankly disgusted.<br /><br />\\"A Walk Across the Rooftops\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time. As to Wikipedia appropriately puts it, this album \\"was noted for its use of empty space and detailed separation of each musical instrument, designed to showcase the Linn hi-fi equipment to best effect.\\" Whoever was pulling the strings on this remaster had no concept of this. They crushed it (compressed it) likely in order to make it come through Spotify, iTunes, laptop speakers and earbuds immediately \\"louder.\\" They also totally hyped Paul's vocals to the point at which they are so abrasive and distracting that I could not even finish listening to the album.<br /><br />Congratulations mastering engineer (or record label), you followed convention and trend and gave no consideration to the fact that the target audience of this remaster MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT DYNAMICS. If anyone from the label is reading this, my gosh, PLEASE PLEASE remaster this. I am die-hard Blue Nile fan, but I am not even going to pay 18 dollars for a bunch of hyped/crushed bonus tracks. I will stick to the beautiful jazz/classical-esque dynamics of the original masters. I remember the first time I heard this album. It was an dream-like, ethereal listening experience unlike any I'd ever had before. I remember falling asleep to this album on numerous train rides throughout Europe. Everything I fell in love with is gone on this new remaster, and no I am not a purist. It is truly that bad. Anyone with a copy of the old masters and a decent set of headphones or stereo will agree with me.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This is a great book for anyone in high school. There are a lot of feelings that some kids may relate to,  but there are also some adult situations.  As an adult I found it hard to read,  but I think my kids would have enjoyed it
B00499NHLC|5.0|I am so happy we found this show!  This is a brilliant show, with fast-paced, interesting dialogue and great story line. Mystery lovers will really enjoy it.
B007NUP80C|1.0|The music is great, but on the CD/DVD deluxe version don't expect to see any video performance of Melanie Gardot on the DVD. All that you get is the title plus music, brief interviews, and you have to select the songs one by one.  Don't waste your money.
0670024813|2.0|I loved his 2 prior books,  Collapse and Guns, Germs and Steel. This latest book has none of the originality or uniqueness his earlier work.  About half way through it I put it down, it is terminally boring.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This product was everything i thought i was going to get. a great cd as a present for my mom. The only problem i have is that when that when the CD is playing in the computer the song names come up wrong. but that i can live with . Great CD in mint condition.
1451696191|5.0|This book was such an amazing thing to read. It's so deep and thought-provoking and I loved how real the characters were for a teenager like me. I recommend this book 100%.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was taken by the premise of this show before it came out, and when I did finally see the first episode, I was not disappointed. It was great that each show that I missed could be purchased separately on Amazon.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Skyfall is stylish and exciting as only a James Bond film could be.  This movie fits well in line with the previous two Daniel Craig Bond offerings.  You will be entertained.  You will get action galore.  You will get amusing character interactions.  The new Q is wonderful, arrogant, and very useful.  You can sense that this guy is going to take the Bond films into some more modern approaches and create realistically useful gadgetry.  M is harsh yet bursting with hidden emotion as always.  You will get a series of death-defying scenarios that leave you wondering how Bond will get out of them.  Interestingly, you also get to see a side of Bond you never have before: the aging operative pushed by higher-ups to doubt himself and pushed by circumstances to worry that his injuries and age may get him killed.  Loved it.  New twist on a beloved character.  Cannot wait to see where the next films go.
B008JFUMT2|4.0|Yippee-ki-yay! (If you know the rest, you may be part of the audience for whom this R-rated action-packed demolition derby was made...smile...)<br /><br />He's baaaack.... John McClane is our favorite Energizer Bunny. Bruce Willis's dependable \\"Die Hard\\" action franchise (1988, 1990, 1995, 2007) continues to print money, so why not? I'm sure the DVD will sell for Amazon, too.<br /><br />This time Mr. McC. is off to Russia because his grown son seems to be off the grid, and his daughter asks him to find him and bring him home. This prompts an unending series of vehicular smashes, gunfire, rocket fire, helicopter crashes, fist fights, suicidal leaps off roofs and down fire escapes, plus other violent action that I have forgotten. I have NEVER seen so many thugs shot, vehicles smashed and interiors destroyed.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Bruce Willis (\\"Looper\\") is John, he tries in vain to speak Russian but the cabbie just laughs at him and treats him to a Frank Sinatra song.<br />  * Jai Courtney (\\"Jack Reacher\\") is Jack, who seems to be in a tight spot, but does NOT want Dad to get involved.<br />  * Mary Elizabeth Winstead (\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\") is Lucy, she doesn't know who she should worry most about, her dad or her brother.<br />  * Sebastian Koch (\\"The Lives of Others\\") is Komorov, a former gangster worth the price of your ticket.<br />  * Yuliya Snigir (\\"Kokoko\\") is Irina, the gangster's resourceful (and beautiful) daughter.<br /><br />Blazing guns, fast cars, skidding semi trucks, non-stop action, blowie uppie stuff...you know the drill: Suspend disbelief, watch for five minutes, lather, rinse and repeat.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read this book and throroughly enjoyed it.  It's an entertaining read and it's not all about zombies.  It's more about humans after zombies arrive.  Politics, economy, human experience, etc.  It's just something you should read.  Especially if you are a fan of AMC's Walking Dead.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|What a cast! We are in a small southern town which our young hero Ethan longs to escape; his long-dead mother told him that the secret was the town library. As a result of meeting the new girl in his high school class, he uncovers a dark history about his town, his family, and a whole bunch of hocus pocus that seemed to involve immortals. There were flashbacks to the Civil War and something about a medallion. I found that part confusing...The DVD from Amazon will make it clearer.<br /><br />This PG-13 Fantasy/Drama stars:<br />  * Alden Ehrenreich (\\"Twixt\\") is Ethan, our young bookworm longing for better things, but he understands the human condition. This actor has such an ingenuous manner, it makes him winning, witty and sweet.<br />  * Alice Englert (\\"Singularity\\") is Lena, the mysterious new girl. On her sixteenth birthday she may or may not join The Dark Side. She thinks being a mortal might be the answer to all her problems. This actress has a charming toothy smile so we can see why Ethan finds her so appealing.<br />  * Emmy Rossum (\\"Phantom of the Opera\\") as Ridley, the siren calling our heroine to The Dark Side. I first saw this actress as a gawky, barefoot hillbilly in a charming 2000 movie called \\"Songcatcher.\\" She's come a LONG way!<br />  * Jeremy Irons (\\"Margin Call\\") as Macon, who knows the only way to protect his niece from The Dark Side is to get that mortal teenager out of her life! Irons can certainly pull off a good Southern accent!<br />  * Emma Thompson (\\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is Mrs. Lincoln, always on guard against sinful books and unsavory people (gays, blacks, Democrats, the list goes on and on). This wonderful actress steals the show with her authentic accent, creepy attitude and convincing delivery.<br />  * Viola Davis (\\"The Help\\") is Amma, the local librarian who has helped raise our young hero ever since his mother died about 10 years ago. Davis raises the bar for any movie she is in.<br />  * Eileen Atkins (\\"Cranford\\") makes an elegant Gramma, who understands all about \\"The Spell,\\" but hopes her granddaughter can break it. This wonderful British actress earned a BAFTA for her work in the miniseries \\"Cranford.\\"<br />  * Margo Martindale (\\"Seabiscuit\\") is Aunt Del; her top-heavy wig never falls over, and that in itself is noteworthy. This is the actress who was so chilling in both \\"Justified\\" and \\"Million Dollar Baby.\\"<br /><br />The script by Richard LaGravenese (\\"Water For Elephants\\") offers wonderfully witty, characters; my main problem is that the direction by Richard LaGravenese (\\"Freedom Writers\\") leaves a lot of plot holes...smile...
0679805273|5.0|This book was for my daughter who started kindergarten this year.  We have plans for it and her teachers as she goes through school  I hope she'll appreciate it when she graduates.
B005LAIHTA|4.0|I guess I'd call this a PG-13 romance with an edge. We have attractive leads, mysterious pasts and dark secrets..... The book on which this is based is by Nicholas Sparks (\\"The Notebook\\") so it MUST be romantic, right? And there has to be an idyllic boat ride on a bayou...and two lovers caught in the rain. The movie is directed by Lasse Halström (\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\") so it will feel like real people in a real situation, with humorous bits tossed in just for fun. As you can tell, this is actually pretty good because we have plenty of people to root for.<br /><br />We watch:<br />  * Josh Duhamel (\\"Transformers,\\" \\"New Year's Eve\\" and lots of TV) as Alex, a widower of two years, helping his two youngsters cope with their loss and helping his uncle run a little grocery store/gas station/tackle shop in a North Carolina fishing village. BTW, this actor is really good with children!<br />  * Noah Lomax (Lots of TV) is Josh, his older child who remembers, and still misses, his mom.<br />  * Mimi Kirkland in her first movie role, is Lexie, the younger child who only remembers the idea of her mother. She's a precocious, loyal little busybody.<br />  * Julianne Hough (\\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Footloose\\") is Katie, fleeing for her life from Boston and trying to find a safe haven beyond the reach of her pursuer.<br />  * Cobie Smulders (\\"The Avengers\\") is Jo, the lovely neighbor who befriends our heroine.<br />  * David Lyons (Lots of TV) is either a cop, an abandoned husband, or both.<br /><br />There are plenty of other characters, but time does not permit... I could have done without some of the bucolic photography, but it was only 115 minutes. Suffice it to say, this had no profanity and some chaste love making, but had a real nail-biter of a climax and a totally unexpected twist...plus Duhamel is VERY easy on the eye! When I get the DVD from Amazon, I can back it up a time or two...smile...
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This is a great book.  I read this after The name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss and many had referred my to Lynch.  I enjoy his work and his writing style.
B00821OX98|4.0|good show in that it makes me wana find out what happens next. i like how ruthless the invaders are. the acting is good esp noel wiley and the captain i dunno who the actor is but the's good the rest of the acting is kinda over the top but still good cause the story is good.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Can anyone really not love this show? Every season has been outstanding.  If you love to be entertained, this would be the show to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Did not like that Katniss's character seemed to fade in this book, especially the ending. Hated the killing of her little sister!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have personally known some people who have had \\"life after death\\" experiences. Always been fascinated by other dimensions of life that seem to be cut off from our humanity due to the limitations of our physical bodies. The mind and the spirit, however, seem to have the potential to experience these other dimensions. This gentleman is believable: liked his ability to scientifically refute others who challenged him, including his own mindset that he assessed along the way. Good read.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|This is a movie that should live forever especially with the Blu-ray improvements. Audrey Hepburn is magnificent in her role.
B002XWXPC8|4.0|Charlie sheen is dynamite as usual, and there is just enough of a plot to keep the movie rolling along.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My grand kids chose this game and they have hours of fun playing it.Moves to fast for grandma to play
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|first game seemed harder. the first time I died,  I had 20 men, lol. now I'm stuck on level 8-8 cause I cant climb the darn walls.  fun game though, hope there's a part three
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My grand kids downloaded this game they love it and play it for hours. I tried to play it but to fast for my old eyes.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As usual Harry is dedicated to finding the killer of a youg woman, even though the muder occurred 20 years ago.  Harry goes off in his lone wolf fashion, but this time he gets help from a very unexpected source.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Honestly, it's angry birds, it's pieces of plastic.  I think it works great, the kids load it up and let it go.  It may not be as entertaining for older groups, but my 3-8 year olds love this game, you can always tell when they're playing as they start cracking up.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game was a challenge which keeps the brain active and its also fun for all ages more games like this please
0811874192|5.0|My mother got one and I saw it (open) on her coffee table. really unique and beautiful. bought one for our house and a couple to give as gifts. really like the elastic bands attached to the cover and back that helps hold the page/layout you want open. I have another pop up book and it doesn't have these and its hard to display open as a result.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome addictive game with a whole bunch of new places like last,New York,&Rio one of the best ways to pass the time
B00ARPMIJE|3.0|an easy read.. quite entertaining story of hardship turning into triumph through interconnecting circumstances and dedication<br />by the principal character.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|A great book with many details I am a huge fan of diary of a wimpy kid it was a great book
159514188X|4.0|You've Got to Read This!<br />13 Reasons Why?<br /><br />This novel is about A young girl that committed suicide  and sends out 13 cassette tapes out to 13 different classmates of hers. Those 13 people all play a part in why she killed herself. The tapes have to passed along or they would be released to everyone at school. The narrator of  the novel is a classmate of Hanna the girl that killed herself , he had a huge crush on her.<br />The book starts off very strong very suspicious with a lot of suspense && it stays with that tone throughout the entire book.<br />I believe the whole message the author is trying to convey  is that bully can cause a lot of hurt and so can hiding things .<br />In conclusion I believe that this  book was a very well written book that doesn't lose your attention  at any point
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it best app in the app store but the problem is you can't switch from creative mode to survival mode otherwise BEST game ever, get  it now people.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|we listen to this cd all the time, cant get the songs out of my head. even the grandkids love the music.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I stumbled upon this book and wasn't really thinking it would hold my interest. It was a pleasant surprise although it didn't end the way I had anticipated it would. Very thought provoking subject.highly recommend this read.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The true story of how IT operations and developments can work together for joint business success!<br /><br />The &#34;story&#34; format made it a compelling read.  It honors &#34;The Goal&#34; by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt while covering new territory in the information technology factory of today.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story, good ending! Kept me guessing up to the very end! I recommend this book to all! Will definitely read another Nicolas Sparks book!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it was cool, so i thought i might as well rate it and i really really loved it everyone should download it
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This book was an easy read and easy to put into use immediately. If your shy or just not sure what to say in social settings this book is for you!
B00358ESI4|4.0|I work with Vets who have PTSD.  Some go back to the Vietnam war.  Mel does a good job as the Colonel.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed reading The Misremembered Man. It's a tale set in Ireland in the 70's that hold your attention and entertains you. The characters are warm and interesting. I really enjoyed the book.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Very well done.  Seen it before.  Dicaprio does a great job as a soldier in Africa.  Four more words ok.
B0055OMBIU|5.0|This is a very fun puzzle.  The first layer is mostly brown and difficult.  We ended up having to fit the last 50 or so pieces by trial and error as we couldn't tell where they went from the image.  The second layer was somewhat simpler.  The end result is very informative.  We are planning on taking a trip to Paris and it gave us a good idea of distances and the layout of the older city.  Be prepared for a challenging jigsaw!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Lot of words i didn't know there but now I do  thanks again. I hope more people enjoy this 2
B0041O40EI|5.0|The completed puzzle is very useful for picturing the relationship of the old buildings in London.  I wish that a bit more west of the current puzzle could have been included.  The first layer was challenging but not as difficult as the first layer of the companion Paris puzzle that we found had very indistinct pieces.  Most of the pieces for the first layer are the same shape so one must go by pattern to fit them in rather than piece shape.  A fun puzzle.
B004OR199G|5.0|Everyone should read this Book!!!Everyone should read this Book!!Everyone should read this Book!!Everyone should read this Book!!Everyone should read this Book!!!
B004H1V5RU|3.0|Do not buy this one unless you have bought the other Perplexus products first.  This one is extremely difficult.  After several attempts I was only able to get to obstacle 15 (their are more than 100 obstacles).  I bought this because I thought it would give the students several hours of entertainment before they would be able to complete it, but I think it would take them several years before they would ever be able to complete it (that is why I only give it 3/5 stars).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just discovered Downtown Abbey. Watched Seasons 1 and 2 through Amazon Prime. Been telling my staff to start calling me &#34;My Lady&#34; but so far they are not following through. Where's Carson to straighten them out??
B007REW8AC|5.0|This was or is not your ordinary CD. Most or IMO all the songs were great and very enjoyable to listen.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game.  a lot of units and equipment to chose between from. the combat isnt the greatest but it will keep it interresting.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|I was enjoyed Train. This one in particular was good. Like their previous CD's, there are two to four songs that are great and the rest OK. Just like most CD's, no matter who the artist is....in most cases you may get one good song. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is the it has three or four great/good songs maybe five and the rest were fun to listen to.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun game - problem is it freezes my MB520 to the point where shutting down the phone is almost an impossibility.  I might get one or two games in then freeze time................. won’t even force close from the pop up (if it comes up).  Very frustrating, will probably uninstall - too bad!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Don't know what to expect from Bruno Mars CD. Never really heard of him, until he was on the Grammy's. I heard his song on the radio, before then, but never really knew who he was. Glad I purchased the CD, it was full of energy and very enjoyable to listen to.
B00007L4OM|5.0|My opinion of course:<br /><br />A great entertaining movie that is just that .... an entertaining movie!! It's by no means an Oscar winner but it is funny and cute.<br /><br />The movie / story flows pretty well and the action sequences are well timed. Jean Reno is great, as usual, and so are the supporting actors, Ryôko Hirosue (Yumi) and Michel Muller (Momo).<br /><br />Casablanca it's not, but as I stated before, it's just an entertaining movie.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Wife loved the CD. Didn't expect too much overall. Wife wanted to buy the CD for just one particular song. Tried to suggest of just downloading that one song, since most CD's usually have the one song that they play over and over on the radio that is the &#34;only&#34; song that is good. But she insisted on getting the whole CD.songs. Surprisingly most of the song were good.
0062082353|5.0|This was a great book!  Chris did a great job explaining all the technical terms so it was easy to understand.  I could almost feel like I was sitting there having a beer with him, as he told his story.  I cried, and laughed ALOT!! Great job, Chris!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved this series, clean, wholesome and outstanding characters. I would recommend this to anyone of any age. Good, fun, pure
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Very effective light!!  Easy to use. I was surprised by how much area the light illuminated in a completely dark area.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Although the beginning of this books is a little difficult to sort out all the charachters, it grows very interesting and hard to put down.
0783240287|5.0|Very good experience. My daughter love this story and was thrilled to receive it for her birthday! Thank you very much.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  The book opens a person's eyes and is a really good book for yound readers !
B0065AVS0K|4.0|Not for the squeamish; over-the-top gore, but humorously done. After I saw movie I read some of the g-novels: very true to the original works.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|Watched this as a kid in my grandparent's house. I don't remember any specific episodes, but I remember the opening well.<br /><br />The series made leaps and bounds as it advanced. Early on, sets end or the painted backdrops are a bit too painted, but throw in trips to Hawaii and actual footage of various Air Force and NASA instillations definitely improves things. Several musical and other entertainment guest stars appear, which was a surprise. Fun to see the era in this show.<br /><br />As for the seasons overall, there are some moments where I just hate Roger for trying to steal Jeannie, but he's forgivable in the end. The episodes and seasons progress well. Early on the episodes seem more interested in connecting and really playing on being discovered. This occasionally resurfaces, but the series has crazy fun. Becoming a rodeo, piano, and every other kind of virtuoso only for the episode appears a lot.<br /><br />I wish there were chapter skips within the episodes to skip the opening song (though, I watched it plenty of times). Not enough series do this. No big deal. My only real disappointment with the series itself is that there is no real end. You watch the last episode of the season, and it doesn't wrap up anything. This is odd considering that the last season does include an episode that seems to do just that--and ends up being a dream sequence. Huh.<br /><br />Other than this, everyone's disappointment over the packaging is about right. I never keep such things so I didn't mind this.<br /><br />All in all, if you ever saw the show, this is a good buy. I'm glad that I got it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love all the tips, recipes and craft ideas.  Maybe a little addicting at first, but  the information you are getting is worth it! Totally love this app!!
B0019TYQ38|5.0|This movie is the best one made of Sense and Sensibility. It arrived as advertized and in the condition advertized.
0385336810|1.0|This is one of the few books from the chick lit genre that I have read.  I am quite disappointed as the characters were two dimensional and the plot was predictable.  Not to mention the ridiculous and obvious ending, that I will not go into to avoid a spoiler review.<br /><br />I bought the book for an easy read on a flight (another mistake due to the fact that the main character has a panic attack on a plane), though I do have a minimum standard for expectations in any novel that I read.  If you are any type of feminist, avoid this book.  The heroine does not have a strong character and smacks of desperation....
B000AQJPQE|5.0|I think too many people are looking for a wow toy for a good price. I feel like I got a good toy for a good price.<br />I liked it so much that I bought another one for a present. Works  for a mobile for a baby that I am watching too.<br />And for the person that says that it eats batteries either they have bad batteries or I got lucky. I have the same batteries in it since Christmas<br />and it is Valentines Day. We use it every night before we go to bed and before nap for the baby. I think it is great for the money. It is better than the TV or ipad or video games. Thank you Uncle Milton who ever you are.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|Great horror movie good story. The quality of the streaming is excellent  I enjoy watching this movie. I also purchased the blue ray version
B008MEM24S|5.0|very fun way to pass the time while waiting in doctor's offices and while traveling. A truly fun for all ages, from small children to senior citizens.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and he read this book in a day. The only fault I can find in this book is that it was too good since it only kept him occupied for that day! :)
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick Riordan has another terrific addition to his series. As usual, Percy and friends band together to face another legendary collection of villains as they try to stop the plans of Gaea to overthrow the world. I can not believe the ending.
0143115014|5.0|They are opinionated, they hate a couple of my favorite fragrances, and some of the reviews could be categorized as &#34;snarky&#34; (something I'm not overly fond of). However, this book is so filled with information and honesty, and often so laugh-out-loud hilarious, that I can't fault it for any of these. You get a real feel for what the perfume will smell like, more than you would from an advert.<br /><br />The authors state their biases up front, so you can take the reviews within context. They do an excellent job of differentiating between a nice-smelling fragrance and a skillfully-created one (not that a perfume can't be both). Additionally, they rate/review without regard to perfumer or price: Vanilla Fields (hello, 90s) comes out surprisingly well.<br /><br />If you're interested in fragrance as an art, this is a great field guide to begin the journey with. It's definitely expanded my idea of what I can wear and has made the perfume counter even more fun to visit.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Christopher Nolan did a great job on this film, both the time of production, and budget of production.  Great Flick!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|There's very little I can add to the other positive reviews of Planet Earth. If you like animals or plants or stunning cinematography, you'll be very pleased.
B004AQR29C|3.0|A lot of fun to watch despite being completly unbelievable which made the movie work for me. A great rainy day movie.
B00BC3IKWE|1.0|I think this is one of my all time favorite bands of all times they should have won a cmt award, I LOVE THEM ALMOST AS MUCH as ICP JUGGALO FOUR LIFEZ!!!!!
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Simply a paycheck movie.  There are some fun moments when they make fun of each others movie signatures like &#34;I'll be back&#34; and others which bring a smile to our face.  Having Jean Claude or as I call him Jackass Clod essentially ruins the movie.  Let's face it, the guy stinks as an actor and seems to be about as stupid as a stump.  The first movie was much better and lots more fun.
B002BG6H9O|5.0|I won't say it is my favorite, because I love them all for different reasons.  There is no part of Origin of Symmetry that I want to forward to the next song.  It is a whole experience.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|I enjoyed the acting and the story.  the acts were funny but also serious.<br />Jon BonJovi was great I loved the songs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hi This app is good but warning very addictive. I play Pc version and its as addictive as pocket edition. ok so this game is about placing blocks to build anything you imagined and to survive the nights of monsters. buy this then later by Pc version. Pc has things like witches and enderman and etc. Plz Buy this app. buy Pc too soon.
B005USZML4|4.0|John Grisham has always been one of my top favorite authors, but I have begun to see a great deal of unwarented, graffic sex seep into much of the books by authors I usually turn to for great entertainment such as Baldacci, and Cook.  I very much appreciate clean, good story telling and the theodore Boone seems to fit the bill.
B000000OTY|5.0|Love this album. I have the CDs and the concert on DVD. It doesn't matter how many times I hear this version of &#34;In Your Eyes,&#34; I always tear up. Beautiful album buy an extremely talented guy. Love Peter Gabriel!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I enjoy reading great story telling without sex and violence and this fits the bill.  Still adult entertainment.  Great read.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great book and it is nice to be able to read it on my iPad. Also, loved the price (FREE!) :)
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My 5 year old and 16 year old love Monster High.  Great price for a popular item! I recommend all monster high movies!
B000001FKY|5.0|Love this album. Wish &#34;Photograph&#34; was on it, but oh well. Still a favorite and a classic album by Def Leppard
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What's to say? They're birds, and they're angry birds! Angry at some nasty little pigs, who had the audacity to get hungry! Pigs bad, must punish pigs......
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Love this classic christmas story and loved reading it on my ipad. Especially loved that it was free. Thanks amazon!
143911000X|4.0|really funny and a quick read just wish it had more material, i skimmed through the whole book in less than an hour
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Love this classic story by Emily Bronte and loved reading it on my ipad. Especially loved that it was free. Thanks amazon!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the Silo Saga and I am now compelled to share my thoughts, especially since it is my very first review.  It's rare for me to be entranced by a novel and this did it for me. The characters, setting, and plot caused me to continue reading until the wee hours of the morning.  Definitely a must read!  AND the Kindle price is a ++
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Just good writing. Keeps you interested, and I read during commercials on TV, because I can't wait to see what's going to happen
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I saw a few of these on the the TV. But my daughter and I are going to do a marithon on the weekend to watch these. I can't wait. Nicely packaged. Thank you. Cannot wait to get the next season.. LOVE THEM.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I was 21 when President Kennedy was assassinated.  This book brought back of lot of memories of what the country went thru at that time.  However, we will never know how or what situation we would be in if President Kennedy had lived.  And of course, it was a fantasy going back in time to save someone' s life.  But I enjoyed the book.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This was good. Great show, quality also looks very good on the kindle fire. Very good buy. I like it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn does it again. He never disappoints. Don't fail to get this one. You won't put it down until it is finished.
0307592731|4.0|Wild is a memoir; so by definition. Strayed is a broken woman at the age of 26. She mourns her mother, who recently died; she has cheated on her husband and destroyed their marriage; she has dabbled in heroin. Her life is a mess. Then she has an idea: she'll hike the Pacific Crest Trail for 1,100 miles - from Southern California to Oregon - alone. It's a journey of self-reliance, self-discovery and physical rejuvenation.<br /><br />Many of the reader reviews were critical of Strayed, saying that she was stupidly underprepared for her journey, foolish and very full of herself. These criticisms are valid, and yet, I'm inclined to be more forgiving.<br /><br />Strayed doesn't shrink from assigning herself blame. She's a mess, it's her own fault, and she knows it. She doesn't ask for sympathy.<br /><br />Raw is the word that comes to mind when I think of the book. Strayed's pain is stripped to the bone. Her fears and doubts keep rising to the surface, and over the long hard miles of the trail, she slowly sheds them just as she sheds most of her toenails. But it isn't an easy task.<br /><br />You may read Wild and question Strayed's life, her decisions and her journey, but she is a talented storyteller. The story had momentum. I read well past my bedtime, and at the end, well - I just wanted to flip the book back over and start again immediately.<br /><br />It's a rewarding story, as worthy of the word \\"inspirational\\" as Eat, Pray, Love is not. Is it \\"great literature?\\" No. It's too introspective, and Strayed is a fluid writer but not a great one.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend it. It's a keeper.
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|bad
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great graphics and more obstacles than the first. So addicting! I have noticed the game glitch once in awhile though, but overall I love Temple Run 2!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is a great series: great casting, great script, great acting, based on a true story. If you're interested in the real story, read \\"Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey\\", written by the Countess of Carnarvon. Highclere Castle is where Downton Abbey is filmed. It's not a phony Hollywood stage.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|great. Very very clever twist on our childhood fairytales.  NOT for children.  Great for adults.  This storyline is better than the originals!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is a great read. I will be re-reading it over and over again.  I am so happy the FBI agent finally has something special in his life.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was highly disappointing when the show was cancelled, but at least Joss Whedon was able to make a movie out of it. The pic of actors/actresses for this show was superb and they all did an awesome job. One of the best sci-fi series that I have ever seen.
B0001I561E|5.0|Bought for my son and this is one of his favorite movies.  He is very happy with it so, I am too.  Thank you
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The special effects were awesome and the acting was superb. I was happy to see leonard nimoy play in the movie.
B00BESM14U|5.0|A well thought out story with fantastic acting. I was impressed with how well the elements of comedy, drama, and suspense came together so smoothly.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The writing, acting, special effects were ale superb. This was a great movie that shows sometimes the little guys win when they are in the right. There were a lot of funny, quotable lines in the movie. As always, Summer Glau delivered an awesome performance.
B007PFD90G|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book about Mr. Rushdie 's undercover life and the events that led up to it and since.  I am in
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This was a great movie and while it could be described as &#34;delightfully awkward&#34; it was funny, charming, heartwarming, and action packed all at the same time.
B008NMT684|3.0|Great puzzles. Fun rewards. Would be really improved if a voice came on and said the name of the vehicle once it is completed.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I must preface this review with the fact that I am not a big Bradley Cooper fan. But I must admit that he did a spectacular job portraying a manic depressive. His manic episode was a bit too shocking for me, as one who suffers from manic depression, I had never seen it from that perspective. Kudos to the makers of this film!
B003ZZAXNG|5.0|i heard so many different opinions about this some said it was dark some said drug induced thisd cd is full of talent  and i think it was brilliant for that time period  i loved this cd ..

B003O86FMW|5.0|Followed the first book seamlessly and had interesting twists and turns. Hard to put down. I wanted to finish to read the 3rd book
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the 3rd book as much as the first two, sorry it came to an end. Wanted more adventures with Catniss and the crew.
0061992860|4.0|Good book but I should have paid attention to the dimensions because it is a pocket sized edition. Tiny font on small pages but it was my own fault. Still a great buy.
B00BF8OYJO|4.0|Pop the kettle on and take a break with Aggie for a few minutes. It's nice to catch a glimpse of her about her business in the agency, and get a whiff of the fresh air of the Cotswolds, while we await the next novel in the series!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Great writing, wonderful acting, delightful handling of a sensitive subject.<br />William H. Macy is wonderful, as usual.  The two leads couldn't have been better.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I'm not a big TV fan, especially with the drivel they have on these days, but this is THEE BEST SHOW out there.  I can not say enough good things about it.  My wife and I have watched the first season 5 or 6 times.  I am constantly in awe at how well the story flows, how great the actors are, the advancement of the plot in each show.  The only complaint I have is that the season is only 9 episodes!  ONLY 9!!  There should be 90!!  But past that this show is so VERY much worth watching..  OK, I lied, I have other complaints about the show, Season 3 is HARD to deal with.  The changes to the family and the loss of members has weighed heavily on my wife and I.  We LOVE each and every character and to have some ripped away like that is horrid.  We've got an emotional investment in these people.  Perhaps I'm too invested in what is essentially a hyped up soap opera, but it's such a well made soap opera!!!!  GET THIS SERIES!!  You'll not regret it!!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Conflicts are unresolved.  He's a great pilot but a drunk.  So what?! His inebriation didn't prevent him from functioning effectively.  It may have helped.  He's a better person sober but that doesn't advance the plot.
1603420398|5.0|I know it's not a very manly thing to do, but I have taken up Crocheting.  And so to that end I purchased this book in the hopes that I could learn some shapes and motifs that I could use to put together a blanket for my daughter.  And WOW!  There are a ton of great designs in this book.  I'm very pleased with the instructions and pleased with the designs..  I'm not all that keen on the color choices they have for the examples they show, but I suppose they had to do contrasting colors so we can see where the color changes are.  I purchased this book in conjunction with the &#34;Connect the shapes Crochet Motifs: Creative techniques for joining motifs of all shapes; includes 101 new Motif designs.&#34;  and I love both of these. And I'm finding out how much fun it is to just sit back, relax and pick up my crochet hook and start working on some simple triangles in a myriad of different colors..  I'm sure I'll probably not be all that relaxed when it comes time to join them all together..  But I truly am very happy with this book.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Ok, only because I have not seen the whole season. First season was good; second<br />season seems like it will be even better.
B001DPDVE8|5.0|I really liked the story line in this movie, and I loved the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was in it as well.<br /><br />The only issue I have with the movie is that I would have liked to have seen Richard Dean Anderson in more of it. I think it would have been even better if he had gone with them to save the world at the end, but regardless of that I still have to give the movie 5 stars.

B0014ERKO0|3.0|--Spoiler Alert--<br /><br />This movie was enjoyable to watch, however I found some of the aspects of the story line somewhat cheesy. Bringing back the replicators might have been OK if it wasn't for the cheesy replicator-infected guy who seemed more like a bad ripoff of the Terminator than anything related to Stargate SG-1.<br /><br />I have to admit that I considered giving the movie 2 stars, but after thinking about it for a few minutes I decided that the rest of the movie was good enough that it didn't deserve that low of a rating.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I recommend seeing the movie, however I recommend you look elsewhere if you really want to use the digital copy. There is no simple, easy-to-use iTunes code. This has some retarded Ultraviolet digital copy redemption which requires the creation of 3 different accounts to redeem your code. Then, you have to pick a streaming video service that nobody uses in order to watch your movie, and then it is available to stream only. You can forget about being able to download a copy to load on your iPad, so you can watch it on a plane or what have you. I recommend this product to those who want to watch a well made, highly entertaining movie on either Blu-ray or DVD. The digital copy is so useless, they shouldn't even be allowed to advertise it on the box.<br /><br />**Correction 2/14/13**<br /><br />It has been brought to my attention that you must insert the DVD containing the digital copy into your computer in order to download the digital copy via iTunes. Since I have no disc drive, I wasn't able to do so. Hope this helps others out there who do not have a disc drive in their computers.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought I could be hooked onto a show about zombies but this show goes beyond zombies and draws you in with characters you fall in love with!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Wuthering Heights is a pleasant read if you enjoy classics.<br />I enjoyed the unexpected twists as well as the absurdity of the characters.<br />Without giving away too much, its a tragic romance which doesnt just affect the main characters but those around them as well. I enjoyed it.<br />The old phrases and jargon are quite a bit to handle, so if reading on the Kindle, its great with the built in dictionary!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall has it all action, suspense, emotion, humor, and charm. Daniel Craig is perfect as Bond not quite \\"Connery perfect\\" but Craig gives  a hell of a performance.

B009FZFONO|5.0|The directing makes a very believable scenario. My wife ,who is quite intelligent,,,loves the show and even though it can't be real,,she keeps talking about how they will get out of their situation. I myself marvel at the zombie makeup and dummies. Very real and scary presentation,,and in the High def format,,well it makes you feel like you are right there! Does not seem to get stale at all ,I guess because the story line is so interesting and involved. Holds your interest and leaves you with a &#34;I can't wait to see the next episode&#34; feeling.  Wifey and I give it a TWO thumbs up!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is out of the norm from other Nicholas Sparks books that I have read - this is a very touching story, but not the typical tear-jerker one would expect from him. I am so glad I read it and am looking forward to seeing the movie.

1451695195|1.0|Dr. Alexander claims that he knows what a \\" Near Death Experience\\"  is.<br />Fine and well. I myself have also had such experience and so have many others. The problem  with this book is that instead of approaching and studying as much as possible about this phenomena from not only a medical perspective but with the added dimensions of philosophy, psychology, physics, cultural anthropology and especially other religious/spiritual angles included for the purpose of trying to correctly interpret and make sense of his own personal experience, Dr. Alexander instead interprets his \\"spiritual\\" experience rather exclusively through the lens of one who has  been conditioned by our cultural Christian theological format and those  visualizations from popularized myths that arise from this \\"spiritual\\" cultural theological atmosphere which dominates in the west-- even if he is openly skeptical of the traditional tenets of Christian theology and its belief that the Jewish man named Jesus was God in physical flesh. I am sure, that were he raised in the Hindu culture his visualizations would have been quite different even if he were not a practicing Hindu and he was openly skeptical of those deities. He still is interpreting a mental or \\"spiritual\\" experience via certain and particular cultural symbols that exist in one's own social environment.<br />This is not a serious book. It is for those wishing to find their \\"spiritual\\" beliefs about the \\"afterlife\\" re-enforced by the credentials of one whose  profession is in modern western medicine. This  seems to be an attempt by the author to capitalize on the current cultural interest in \\"near death/out of body\\" experiences. He neither confirms any religious belief through synchronizing the interpretations  of his experience in accordance to any particular religious doctrine (as did the author of 90 Minutes In Heaven) or sets up any objective schedule by which  others can  follow in order that  a tactile explanation  can be built upon in order that we as humans are able to understand what is going on when the brain ceases to function according to conventional medical clinical standards and when the mind seems freely able to travel into some greater and more expansive state  that is beyond the physical dimensions of the cranium.in order that we as humans are able to understand what is going on when the brain ceases to function according to conventional medical clinical standards and when the mind seems freely able to travel into some greater and more expansive state  that is beyond the physical dimensions of the cranium.

B00A81MV3U|1.0|Think of a jigsaw puzzle.  A little is missing on the left, a little is missing on the right.  What do you do?  Fit the two parts together and voila, you've got a whole!  That's exactly what we were supposed to fall for with this movie.  Put Pat (mentally ill) and Tiffany (mentally ill) together and what do you get?  A couple who magically make a whole, and who are now (drum roll please) mentally healthy, ready to face the world together!  Such a stupid premise.  Really stupid. After viewing Silver Linings Playbook, why wouldn't  shrinks all across America start thinking, \\"Hey, I think my 9 o'clock and my 10 o'clock would make a great couple!!! Say, how about my 3 o'clock and my 4 o'clock???\\" It's nominated for so many categories for the Oscars, (even Best Picture if you can believe it), we're going to be inundated with clips from this wretched movie for the whole night.  I love love love the Oscars, but this year I am going to drive to Niagara Falls, go to my favorite casino and play the slots all night and forget the Oscars are being televised.  And as for the reviewers who called Pat and Tiffany quirky?  Oh my.  If only mental illness was simply an issue of just being quirky.  My suggestion: Avoid this dreck at all costs. Instead, rent Joe Wright's brilliant and sumptuous Anna Karenina or sit by the fire and read a good book. Let's face it. It's the middle of winter and we're all going a little stir crazy.  Don't let the idiocy of Silver Linings Playbook take away your last little shred of sanity.<br />P.S.  I am writing this review as my public service announcement for 2013.
0425252868|5.0|I ordered this book for my dad, a WWII veteran and both a military/small-plane pilot, but accidentally had it delivered to my home, not his. So I decided to read it and was mesmerized. Dad later was too, finished the book in three days and went back to read it again before forwarding to two other pilots/history buffs. The story is told mostly from the perspective of an elite German pilot, many personal details about life in the German Air Force before, during and after the war. I wished there had been more about the American pilot's experience but he flew many fewer missions. The book might be difficult for anyone who fought in Europe during WWII but for us, it was a page turner.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is everything the best reviews say it is -- entirely engrossing, superb acting, subplot after subplot -- impossible to stop watching.  Like a great novel, the characters just continue to live with you.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I admit, I was skeptical.  I picked this up based on a few otehr reviews and the low low price, thinking \\"what've I got to lose?  It's 99 cents.\\"  The page blurb \\"The adventures of an astronaut stranded on mars\\" did it no favors.<br /><br />But this turns out to be one of the most gripping, funny, and strangely human stories I've read in the past several months.  I've read a lot of the recent \\"best of the year\\"s and most of them were quite good, but this?  This blew me away.<br /><br />There are some editorial mistakes - a few typos, an odd sentence here or there, but it never detracts from the story.  When I started, I thought the narrative trick of \\"log entries/diary\\" would get old quick, but when he did switch to other characters partway through I found myself kind of wishing to get back to the main story, because I wanted to know what happened next to Watney.<br /><br />There isn't a ton of \\"character development\\" - a few flashbacks, some office politics at NASA, but nothing beyond \\"there's a guy trying to survive\\" and \\"there are scientists trying to help him.\\"  And yet, you don't really miss it - anything like that would feel superfluous to the very taut main plot anyway.  The science fiction is pretty hard - everything that happens is fairly plausible, and based on current real-world tech (or, if not what we have right now, what we could have in about 5-10 years).  Admittedly a lot of the Watney's survival is due to lucky breaks - everything left behind just happens to work - but it's balanced by some near-catastrophic incidents to remind you that his luck isn't always good.<br /><br />It's also remarkably funny.  Mark Watney's character is presented as a bit of a joker, which in-story helps keep him alive, and as a literary device provides a way for his logs to be something other than dry laundry-lists of facts.<br /><br />The only real stretch of credibility in this book is that NASA would ever have the funding to put together a series of Mars missions on its own.<br /><br />It's not a perfect book, but it's a great read, a good story, and it's hard to put down.
1594745692|5.0|I know Zombie's are all the rage right now, so a Zombie Tarot isn't too surprising. But this is such a unique spin. The art has a 1950s post-atomic-bomb-apocalyptic feel. It was perfect right after the Housewives Tarot. They balance each other.<br /><br />It comes in a pretty heavy-duty cardboard box similar to the Housewives Tarot. The cards are made from a thick cardstock that seems like it will last forever!<br /><br />I adore the artwork but the numbered cards didn't always make logical sense. Look at the Seven of Swords above, there are no swords or knives, there are 8 zombies...see, there's no number tie-in. I'm not enough of an expert to know if this is a problem or not, after all the cards are clearly labeled. And from what I've read in the booklet, the pictures can pull you toward their meaning.<br /><br />It's a little gory without being too off-putting. These are so kitschy, you just gotta love them even if you don't read the tarot. But what better deck to learn from than one that makes you laugh and you enjoy looking through. In one tarot book I've read, the author says you should play with your cards to learn them better. This deck encourages much play, even my children keep digging into it, and they have their very own tarot deck.

B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Its cute.  I wish there was a way to earn peanuts or add friends from their zoos.  Otherwise it is very cute and I found myself quickly addicted.  Unlike a lot of other games like this where you just breed animals and purchase them, in this one you get to go 'rescue' them.  You never know what you may find.  You level up quickly which opens more areas.

0321784421|5.0|This is good book to get familiar with the HTML5 and all the new API's and specifications that are<br />or will be implemented in HTML5.

If you<br />like to know more about some specific topic like canvas, geolocations, ... it is best to buy specific<br />book for that topic.<br /><br />The only difficult thing for me was to understand some words or phrases because English is not my native<br />language and this book is written in British-English which for me is more difficult to understand than<br />US English.<br /><br />It good if you have some basic knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript because the authors are assuming that.<br />Very big plus for this book is that the authors have big background/experience in HTML and web related<br />technologies and they are very well familiar with the evolving HTML5 specifications.

B00170KA0C|2.0|In some ways, it was hard not to like Mona Lisa Smile. The cast of female actors was truly amazing. Really just watching their facial expressions and gestures was nearly entertaining enough that I almost didn't need a plot. The 50's outfits and hair styles were eye candy and the setting was gorgeous. Just watching the girls interact and sit and talk together was fun to see. The campus setting is, of course, beautiful and nostalgic.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin was a major show-stealer portraying the girl at her college who cannot find a boy to date. (Though I think she is breathtaking to look at... hard to believe SHE can't find a boy!) Her potential in this film is extraordinary and she outshines more experienced actors like Kirsten Dunst with ease. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Julia Stiles were their normal awesome selves... and I enjoyed seeing Krysten Ritter in a small sleeper role/ cameo as &#34;art student&#34; (even silent and in the background she is drop-dead gorgeous). Of course the list of amazing young women (and some of the professor roles) goes on and on.<br /><br />I just wish this film had a plot that made sense or was inspiring. Julia Roberts as the inspiring professor, Ms. Watson, was wooden and bizarre. She played an unusually unlikeable character. I had a feeling she wasn't exactly sure what to do with this role or how to make this part work. In some parts she is perfect as the inspiring professor as we see her sitting with the students in a casual position by their desks and talking, sharing special moments with them and opening up during girl time, tears in her eyes as she shows advertisements of women selling out to the ideal of the housewife and pleading with them to ask for more than what is offered.<br /><br />I wanted this movie to stick to this ideal and to really develop it. But there are such confusing plot points.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILERS TO DISCUSS FILM:<br /><br />First Ms. Watson has an obviously distant relationship with a man she's not intimately close to. When this relationship is first shown via a phone call, it seems like it is obvious this man is not committed to her and he is probably her &#34;back up&#34; boyfriend. Later he shows up, suddenly the romantic suitor who puts a ring on her finger without her answering his proposal. I wasn't sure what to make of this relationship. At one point Watson calls her boyfriend &#34;Bill&#34; who is the male professor she later sleeps with... BUT there's been no real development of a relationship with the Bill guy yet. (Bad splicing of film? Sequence of events didn't quite make sense.)<br /><br />The film sets up Watson as a liberal who is a feminist and teaches her girls to be so too... but it seems like she's just a woman who is afraid of commitment, intimacy and marriage. I couldn't actually tell if she WAS a feminist or a liberal or if she was just terrified of relationships. She's encouraging her students to not marry and makes fun of them when they do. Instead of seeming like she wants them to succeed as independent women, it comes across like she's jealous, angry, frightened and downright disturbed by marriage.<br /><br />Watson breaks off her very short engagement to the sensible, loving fiance and then immediately turns to Professor Bill, the Italian professor who has been sleeping with one of her students until the week before. I found this to be a turn-off on so many levels. It further proved the point that this film has nothing to do with educational values or independent females, but everything to do with a disturbed professor who fears men and marriage and so leaves a sensible one to be with a reckless one who not only seduces his students and breaks their hearts, but is a liar and a fake as well. All this with a man she barely knows but she falls all over him at a student's wedding and makes it obvious to the world and the staff that she is sleeping with him. Very unprofessional and strange. Feminist? Independent? This woman seems weak, insecure and desperate. She pulls the irresponsible man toward her and pushes the sensible opinions away. Meanwhile setting an example for her students that is confusing and contradicting. (So it's &#34;strong&#34; to be easy in bed? What?)<br /><br />In a cliche turn of events, one of the students who is &#34;typically 50's&#34; eventually &#34;becomes independent&#34; when her husband of two weeks is already having an affair. And the student who is showing promise to already be independent suddenly becomes &#34;typically 50's&#34; when she decides not to go to law school and gets married instead. I don't know what sort of point the film was trying to make with this. Neither story adds up or makes sense or is inspiring... but neither is it discouraging. It's just... shrugs.. there. Again, what's wrong with getting married and having a family? Obviously the girl didn't want to go to law school. The girl who &#34;becomes independent&#34; didn't want independence either... it was forced on her by a cheating husband.<br /><br />When Watson takes off at the end to go to Europe I was thinking (but wasn't she upset the MAN didn't go to Europe... what?) Why is she going? Who cares? Is she still terrified of men... YES. She leaves two men in one film for the lamest reasons. Is it because she's a liberal feminist? Nope. Or I missed something.ecure and desperate. She pulls the irresponsible man toward her and pushes the sensible opinions away.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Outstanding novel!!  Connelly and Harry Bosch are an unbeatable team.  Well written and interesting from  beginning to end.  If you enjoy a good story and crime solving, this is another Harry Bosch winner.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Being a fan and collector of most of the Warner Bros Batman movies for the past 20 years, I have found the quality of each of the fikms to vary from good to excellent.  This one rates up at the excellent end,  great story, music, smooth animation, and love Batman and Commisioners Gordons voices.  Not a film for young kids, but more for those who appreciate the grimness of the batman myth.<br />If you liked part 1, I think you will love this
B0090XK9CC|5.0|As many times as I've watched this movie, and practically know it by heart...I've never seen this movie this VIVID!!!<br />LOVE IT EVEN MORE!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have this on my phone my pod pad and now fire I love this App and that id all I have to say j would even pay for it you will love this app sk get it it is a lot better than the regular temple run

B009K72RRS|5.0|As a long time fan of the Star Wars franchise I love how this season is developing, It gets darker and keeps me on the edge of my seat.
B007REV4YI|3.0|With the world faced with many real villianous groups we get a another bad british spy story. Instead of gadgets we get none, we get a story of revenge on the british secret service. Why not a story about terrorists? or other groups? This is a ok story but it's like the endless bad cop movies , they can't seem to make anything but that kind of movie. IN hollywood all spies are betrayed by their own agencies and then go around killing their own people. This is getting old. Bond needs to bring down some commies ,world domination nuts , mad scientists, muslim terrorists or something other than just another betrayed spy story. Still the picture looks great in hd and the acting is fine. THe villian is superbrilliant at least.<br />It's my least favorite bond movie for sure but it's still a good bond flick in a dramaitic sort of way. If they can give us real villians and then throw in a drama like this one , most of us wouldn't care but...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this. I use this all the time to read on my tablet when I'm waiting at an appointment or wherever I am and need to read to kill time.
B00AXVZKOM|4.0|This fun tv show that intermixes fairy tales and classic  stories to make a interesting fantasy show is a hit show for abc. In this episode Regina is framed for murdering jimminy cricket. She's set up by her mom and from this point on we begin to see her perhaps return to being more evil. Not that she wasn't evil in the first series, she killed a man by squeezing his heart to pieces in that season. The second season is as good as the first one and it's different in many ways. You do need to see the first season to understand the story arc.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I love the game, but after I play it for long enough, it wont open. on my kindle fire. la.
B009LZDGSI|5.0|Each episode of this show features a murder and holmes must solve them. but there is a back story that unfolds as the series progresses. And in this show watson is a woman , played by lucy lui!. The show is a monster hit and it's engaging. I missed the second episode and therefore had to go back and watch it on amazon.com video. THis is a good show for mystery fans and for fans of sherlock holmes. IN this version sherlock is not a sociopath like in the bbc modern version 'sherlock' , he's a guy struggling with addiction and such. It was a gamble that paid off for it's network and the strong acting of it's leads makes for a compelling show. It does need more of moriarty though.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|this one kept us laughing for hours.  i reccommend it as a party gag.  the kids loved it.  i think there are different versions/characters by the same developer.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|I got the uk version that is sold here in the u.s. and it's cheaper by far. It's the same disc as the other versions and works just fine on north american blu ray players. The picture is excellent and the 3d is really good on this movie. The story is a good horror one for young viewers but it may be intense for kids under 7  years old. Still it's nothing compared to what you can see on tv these days!. It's a well done animated show like 'the nightmare before christmas' and others. It's eccentric and the characters in this movie are very well developed. It's worth owning and  you should buy the uk region free version that is only around 10.00 as compared to the u.s version which is 22.00 or more bucks.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|Great read.  life is definitely a cycle.  we all end up where we started.  what lies between is up to us.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I am not going to go into details here as I'm sure that this has been covered from every angle possible. I will say that this movie stinks. It may be some kind of prequel to the Alien films, but it has none of the magic and suspense of the original Alien nor the sheer fun of Aliens. It does however offer a contrived, derivative storyline with a plot that is very similar to the original Alien. Seen that. Done that. Why bother?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|ok guys if you dont have this app get it...one of the best educational tools ever created, better than Guttenbur's press.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was the best of the series . I had heard so much chatter about this book, from reviews to to television pundits. I can see where it got the label of &#34;Mommy Porn&#34;. I don't normally read this type of fiction, so was pleasantly surprised that it held my interest. I have encouraged my friends to read the series. Had a decent story line, well written, at times a little too mush sex, but did get through it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|this is another one of my favorite christmas movie.  i watch it every year and love it.  it just wouldn't be christmas without it.
0375805613|5.0|My 2 adult children loved this book as children.  We wore out at least 2 copies, possibly 3!  Now my grandsons are loving it just like their mom!<br />The rule was whomever read it had to read \\"expressively.\\"  The child is in charge of turning pages.  Grover must sound exasperated (in a LOUD voice) when the child turns the page against his orders.  Hearing your child laughing each time is joyful music!<br />In contrast on the last page of the book Grover must sound very embarassed & speak more & more quiet until the very last word.<br />Every child I've ever read it to wants it read repeatedly.  They end up knowing the story by heart & help tell the story.  It's delightful to see a preschooler with the book (sometimes upside down:) ) telling his version of the story.<br />If the reader didn't read it properly the child would, with a similar Grover exasperated tone, take the book away & find someone who would!<br /><br />I see it's available as an E-book.  I will never own this book in any format but print.  An E-book cannot effectively substitute the effect you get from turning the printed paper page.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone with children in their life or in need of a child's gift.

B00821PCJS|5.0|I love'd it! It caught me by surprise; it has good acting and  a good story line! Directing is good to!
0553801473|3.0|Look these main characters are really good.  We all know by now that Martin can write and he's not afraid to take leaps that many other writers would never dream of and I applaud that but there are some serious problems here.  First it is beyond obvious that Mr. Martin is milking this series out.  The last book did literally NOTHING to advance the plot or solidify main characters.  Another problem is THERE ARE ENTIRELY TOO MANY CHARACTERS.  With it taking so long between books you forget the minor char's and what has happened.  I'm not at all opposed to an author killing off main characters if it develops the plot or has meaning in some way.  However, so far we've seen only 2 main char's deaths actually mean something relevant to the story.  Its like this author is killing main characters just to prove to the reading community or more likely, his peers, that he isn't afraid to go against the grain.  RR Martin is seriously in danger of the Robert Jordan and George Lucas curse in that their popularity has those working with them and for them afraid to do AND constructive editing at all.  Someone needs to tell RR Martin to let an editor methodically work thru his drafts to make them better.  When I was reading the Wheel of Time books I started wondering \\"who the hell is editing this drivel\\", then I found out it was his wife.  Fans of your work aren't the best to add constructive criticism.  I can honestly say I think I am done with these books just like I stopped on book 4 of Wheel of Time.
B004SI893A|4.0|As are all Grisham novels, they are fun, even if he is somewhat repetitive in descriptions of people and events, weaving characters in and out until you begin to wonder, &#34; what happened at the end &#34;, and then he finished with explanation in a few short sentences and paragraphs.

0765325950|5.0|It pretty much wrapped up all the important loose ends nicely (there were a few unimportant story lines that were just left to peter away into the mystery).  Great epic story with a fitting ending.
B008KEQMDC|4.0|While I realized that this is a &#34;chick'flick&#34; when I bought it I must confess that this movie made me laugh and laugh. It probably also probably helped me gain a new perspective on the trials and tribulations I will never experience.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think you should update it for the five stars you want, I know because I love puzzle games like this but if you can't finish it no one will buy it and, no one will rate it at all!

B00A4B9A1U|5.0|It is the first History of USA from the point of view of Stalin!!!! So great to know that finally Stalin has sons whose he could be proud of - two sons who are doing their best to show how himself ( Stalin) was a great man, a man of peace, a man of kindness. I find this idea to tell the history of USA through Stalin's eyes absolutely genius.<br /><br />Of course nobody asks to Stalin to be totally fair. Each reader asks Stalin to be right, to kill all of those who are anti-communist, all the types of social-traitors among them not only the Republicans but most of the Democrats.<br /><br />Of course Stalin will have had always right. He will have won all the battles - he was a genius - even the ones he has not really done as the one against Japan in 1945 and against South Korea \\"fascists\\" in 1953.<br /><br />Of course Stalin have lost no time to read the best new researches made by among the best historians regarding the events such as why the japanese Emperor has decided to surrender  - i.e. Herbert Bix \\"Hirohito and the making of  Modern Japan\\"  (2000) neither the great book by Timothy Schneider \\"Bloodlands\\" neither numerous American, European ( included the Russians ones as Vassily Grossman \\"Life and Fate\\" ) , Asian ( Japanese, Chinese, etc ) Historians and writers who have demonstrated precisely step by step all the non sense of what these two great sons of Stalin  ( Oliver Stone and his friend) have written in this book.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />But it is the reason I love this book so much - first because I love Oliver Stone's films so much - I love his provocative attitude. I am totally sure that he doesn't pretend to become an Historian - he wants simply to make a good provocative film - and he has succeeded. His serie is brilliant. The editing is genius. His Stalinist comments hilarious and always surprising. I know that he dreams will have been to have met Stalin, to have made an interview of him. What a pity! Stalin whohas had a great sense of black humor ( cf Martin Amis's book \\"Koba\\" ) will have appreciated to discuss with Oliver Stone - probably after he will have ordered to shoot him . But that it is another story.<br /><br />I find this book really great for all the lovers of dictators - and specially for the lovers of Putin. I suggest to Putin to propose that Oliver Stone becomes like Gerard Depardieu a citizen of this great peaceful nation.<br /><br />One of the most funniest things of the book is the way they treat George F. Kennan.  They hesitate to make him in the category of \\"Cold Warrior\\" or of an anti-Cold Warrior. But one thing they don't do for sure is to read George F Kennan's essays and his incredible deep understanding of Russia.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />But we don't ask to these glorious sons of Stalin ( Oliver Stone and his friend) to understand Russia or the incredible suffers that Ukrainians, Polish, Jewish Russians and all these minorities have supported from a part of the elite and of the slaves of Ethnic Russians have done during the last two centuries until today.<br /><br />Please read this book it will make you so so furious because of this way to make History as pure propaganda than just after who will ri-ush to read some great historical books as the one by  Giambattista Vico \\"New Science\\"<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />or Niccolo Machiavelli<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />etc etc<br /><br />or Karl Marx<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, 1852<br /><br />or Fernand Braudel \\"Civilization and capitalism\\"<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Oh how great historians help us to understand the present and our future. Surely they have had influenced them by their deep visions of the Past Events.<br /><br />Thank you from the bottom of my heart to Oliver Stone and his friend to have made such effort to write this book and to make their TV serie. It will be for all of us a reference to what must NOT be done.<br /><br />One detail: howis it possible to be a \\"moralist\\" when you pretend to speak about History? After what Niccolo Machiavelli told us? Is it possible to think that there are good and bad leaders who are making history? Only children could think that way. People with no great culture.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I honestly had heard a lot about the book from my best friend. I decided yesterday to start reading it and I fell in love. I honestly don't know how to explain this book. It's a perfectly unfortunate love story with so many plot twists. I don't think I'll ever look at the world the same. But that's the thing about books, they change the faults in you.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|It is my all time fav Austen read.  The Kindle version has a few flaws such as odd spacing or spelling errors but nothing that you are not able to figure out.  The price is right at FREE.

0525478817|3.0|Have you read John Green's The Fault in Our Stars? What was your view as if you thought it was a 5 star read and an OMGher book . Then I suggest that my review might not be to your likening and may offend you in parts . Please remember though , that I am being honest and have made this review not to come across negative about the book as that is not my intentions.<br /><br />So, this is a book that I have had sitting on my Ipad for a while waiting to be read , luckily ebooks don't gather dust otherwise this one would have.  To be honest, I am not too sure why I took so long in reading it , was it because I'm not a huge John Green fan or maybe it was to do that it was a book about Cancer. I'm not too sure exactly what it was that took my time in reading it , but recently in a FB group that I belong to called BA which you have seen referenced in my reviews before. One of the girls there we shall call her S, had been pimping this book hard out and so I thought ok, I've got time to spare, I'm sitting on a bus with nothing to do and a lot of time on my hands so I cracked open my Ipad Bluefire App and started reading it and I did read it until the very last page and to be honest , I felt blah and disappointed at the same time as to me this was an average alright book, nothing great- no sad teary full on crying moments in which I had braced myself for. In fact, it was just another I have Cancer and I might die and I have friends with Cancer and they are sure to pass on as well , but what the hell life is short - so lets set ourselves up for disappointment and date. Another irritating thing was that they chatted about an Author in the book and they get a wish to see him, this perked me up a bit only to find out he's an alcoholic drunk and messed up man who couldn't even take time out of his precious life to be nice to his fans who had come all this way and even on top of that sick just to visit him.<br />So to me, The Fault in our Stars is a hit or miss read and if you do love John Green and reading about people with Cancer etc then this will be the book for you but if you are like me and have read lots of the same type of book - then I wouldn't personally waste the time<br /><br />#This was an ARC from Netgalley.ove John Green and reading about people with Cancer etc then this will be the book for you but if you are like me and have read lots of the same type of book - then I wouldn't personally waste the time<br /><br />#This was an ARC from Netgalley.

B008QMMEOE|5.0|my two year old grandson loves this and other puzzles by this company.  the puzzles that are alittle too advanced for him I do with him, I drag his little finger to the correct spot. To me, it was just good one on one time with him, there is one puzzle that he can do by himself. oh! the happiness and self esteem glows on his face!  this was a really sweet. I thought I was spending good quality time with him never thinking he would be able to do any of these by himself. so for a good couple of times it was me holding his finger. and it still is. But there is one puzzle that are one piece :) that's his.... there is an ocean puzzle by this same company.  Same thing. One that he can do by himself. when he sees me he goes to my purse to pull out my kindle fire and wants to do this puzzle. we really like it. Thank you.

B004SRPXWQ|1.0|My husband has this app on his I-phone, and we both really like it.  So, when I saw I could get the same app for my kindle Fire HD, I was thrilled....only to be disappointed majorly!  I found the app's pictures to be blurry, and I don't think it really was configured right for a larger HD screen. (You know how pictures are when they get enlarged, and they look blurry because they don't have the right number of pixels. That is what the blurriness reminded me of.) Also,Tom did not always hear all of my words, so there were many times he only repeated part of what I said.  I am just assuming that this app is better configured for smaller screens like on phones.  I really do not recommend it.

1423140605|3.0|\\"The Mark of Athena\\" is the third book in The Heroes of Olympus Series (a spin off from the Percy Jackson Series). It follows Annabeth Chase's quest to find her missing boyfriend, Percy, who is a demigod. She learns that Percy has had his memories erased, and now lives in the rival demigod camp of the Roman's, even though he is the son of his father's (Poseidon's) Greek entity. For centuries these two groups have been unable to get along, but now they are trying  to unite against a common force that could destroy them both, Gaea. After having slept for millennia, she is re-awakening. Will the two camps be able to join forces? Will they defeat Gaea? Will Percy and Annabeth be reunited? To find out, you will have to read the book.<br /><br /> In \\"The Mark of Athena,\\" my favorite part would have to be when Leo is possessed by a spirit, while the heroes of the two camps are first meeting. While he is possessed, he fires at, and destroys many parts of the city of New Rome, destroying any talks the two camps were having with each other. The Romans believe that the attack was intentional, and the Greeks must quickly escape, to save their lives. With the two groups fighting between each other, it is unknown if they will be able to defeat Gaea.<br /><br /> All-in-all, I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars. Although, the book is good once you get into the thick of it, I found the book to be very hard to start, because it doesn't really hook you in like the Percy Jackson Series does. The same can be said of the other two books in Riordan's new series. They really are a let down compared to the other books, which were amazing. Also, while the body of the book is good, it is not great. This makes me give the book 3 stars. I believe that anyone who read the Percy Jackson Series, will enjoy this book, but not love it. This would be a great book for children aged 9-13, but really, I know adults who would enjoy the book also.<br /><br /> A good read!<br /><br />Review by Young Mensan Ryan P., age 10san Ryan P., age 10

0765348276|2.0|John Scalzi's view on fighting men: ALL veterans are terrible warriors, responsible for the deaths of more than anything other race in his imagined world. Marines in particular are just awful. But homosexuals, well they're just the best warriors he's ever heard of. And women? They're even more awesome. So awesome in fact that the most hardcore human in the book is a woman. Also, don't judge a book by it's cover.  Just because something looks scary, doesn't mean it is. Seventy-five year olds need a lecture in this, apparently, despite decades of life experience. And, lastly, it seems the absolute best way to live life is to live one in which you've done nothing that anyone could find offensive in any way. At least up until you're given a genetically modified body to go out and kill everything you see. It's pretty annoying to read blatant politically correct statements like this in any book. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by this, based on the posting on his blog.<br /><br />The book is okay and is an easy read, but it's basic premise is seriously flawed. The mystery behind why old men are recruited is weak and leaves an even bigger why: if you have the technology to create genetically modified clones, then transfer consciousness to another body, and you have technology that is directly tapped into your consciousness such that you essentially become a telepath, why don't you have the technology to store that consciousness and essentially make your warriors immortal? What a waste to think that all the experience lost in the 75% ten year loss rate is lost permanently. It's hard to suspend disbelief when the basic premise has such a serious flaw.  Despite all this, the characters aren't completely two dimensional, and the action is pretty good.
0143112724|2.0|The illustrations are pleasant, even beautiful at times. I agree, however, with some of the other reviewers who were disappointed because the illustrations add little to the original Strunk and White classic. What is the point of illustrating examples such as, \\"Somebody else's umbrella\\" and other snippets of grammatical examples that in illustrated form are out of context and irrelevant to the book's purpose? Do we really need an edition of Strunk and White for the sake of whimsey? The book is a tool for writers and is beloved for decades for a reason. The addition of illustrations feels like an exercise in distraction.

B003JTHESA|2.0|Wow.  This is not what I went in expecting at all.  Of course I realize the band members are entering their mid 50's.  They aren't young anymore.  They can't write music the same way anymore.  As a result, I strongly believe Iron Maiden should have retired before creating the Final Frontier.  This is an abomination, seriously.  A strong contender for one of my favorite heavy metal bands from the 80's but the stuff I'm experiencing on the Final Frontier reveals a band that shouldn't even be around anymore.<br /><br />Bruce Dickinson used to have one of the most invigorating, soaring and distinctive vocal ranges in the history of heavy metal.  Now however -at least for this outing- he's basically a middle aged man either incapable of hitting that distinct higher range, or unwilling to stretch his voice and make magic happen.  He's comparable to Ian Gillan of Deep Purple fame- he's another singer that no longer makes his voice soar to the skies.  This *severely* interferes with my enjoyment of the music because, much like Deep Purple, I identify Iron Maiden with a lead singer who can sing his you-know-what off.  Without that voice... this is not worth buying I'm afraid.<br /><br />Most of the songs on the Final Frontier are overlong and lack memorable guitar riffs and solos.  I'm listening to \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" right now to remember the good old days.  You know how the song suddenly switches into a really cool guitar riff a couple minutes in with an energetic and melodic guitar solo, and it's stretched out for a few minutes in epic progressive rock style?  This song captures the feeling of bombs flying through the air on a mission for total destruction.  More importantly, you can remember the notes.  That's half of the reason they were so intimidating and awesome back in the 80's.  The other half is that the notes were actually good.  I can't remember a single song from the Final Frontier because every single 8, 9, 10-minute song is based around mid-tempo, distinguishable guitar riffs and uninteresting guitar solos.  What the?  Again, this is NOT the Iron Maiden I grew up with.  Really disappointing on so many levels.  Oh and just because these songs are long does NOT make them progressive.  Progressive is when the guitar riffs and solos actually *progress*- not limp forward in the most generic way imaginable.  Ugh.<br /><br />The production doesn't help matters.  It does nothing to make any of the guitar riffs or solos stand out, and instead Dickinson's voice is tucked in the back of the mix (which isn't really a bad thing in this case since, again, he's not singing as interestingly as he once did).  Still, this album flat out does *not* rock.  None of the notes are memorable and... it's a really big disappointment in my unfortunate opinion.  With a sad, angry, shocked and disappointed facial expression, I have to say... avoid this one.  Man it's hard to criticize such a legendary band.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ana and Kate were about the same age as I am, and it was hard to feel for them because they just do not converse the way American college-aged girls do. I understand that the author is British, and I feel that maybe she should have done a bit more research on American college life before claiming that the girls lived in Washington.<br /><br />Other than this, it was an easy read and a good story. I will definitely read the other two at some point before the movie comes out.
030746363X|5.0|I read the first 2/3 of this book (slow-card diet, workout) and plan to read the rest when I'm training for something specific. The book was life changing for me. Abs are made where? In the kitchen, and slow-carb is the how.
0525953728|5.0|The story \\"No Easy Day\\", by Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer, is the first hand account of the raid on a secret compound housing the world renown terrorist, Osama Bin Laden.  \\"No Easy Day\\" does an outstanding job placing the reader in the jump seat alongside the operatives of Seal Team Six.  Honestly I couldn't put the book down, and I enjoyed every aspect of it.  The book is a excellent contribution to history, giving an accurate, visceral recount of the events that lead up to one of the most significant military operations of my generation.<br /> In keeping with most books of this genre, the book opens with an introduction to the special warfare community, with brief flashbacks to important events which contribute to the timeline.  The stories are interwoven, giving a much more satisfying perspective of who Mark Owen is, what he stands for, and the sacrifices he made to get to the top.  I never realized that there are two types of Navy Seals.  There's the first kind, the Navy Seal, hardened to the core special operator who will not quite.  Then there's DevGru, the best of the best.  Translated, DevGru is U.S. Navy Special Warfare Development Group, Seal Team Six.  These guys are vetted Navy Seals, who don't quite, will not die, and most importantly, will not and cannot fail.  They simply don't know the meaning of the word failure.  It doesn't exist in their world, and the sacrifices made to defend freedom and democracy go beyond what most normal people can imagine.<br /> This book was very specifically written towards one event, to fill a void left in an emotional scar left upon this great country.  In comparison, a book of a similar nature, \\"The Element of Surprise\\", by Darryl Young, is written to tell the story of a young man and his transformation into a Navy Seal, documenting many events in great detail.  \\"The Element of Surprise\\" is the story of Juliette Platoon, Seal Team One, covering the training (BUDs, etc), the platoon's six month deployment to Vietnam, and the transformation of a young man into a Navy Seal.  That book was comparably enjoyable, and extremely detailed, in covering an entire deployment, along each step of the way.  By comparison to \\"No Easy Day\\" gives an accurate background and focuses on important or key events in Mark's progression thru the ranks of Navy Seal, to his position on Seal Team Six and the deployment for one historic mission.  Both are satisfying to read, with different focal points, one to tell the tale of an adventure in a young man's life, the other to tell the tale of the fall of Al-Qeada, to provide closure in an emotional scar, and to celebrate that closure.<br /> Personally, I cannot recommend this book enough.  A quick easy read, lots of action, a good introduction, and a compelling story make for a very exciting book.  Although as quickly as it begins, the book ends, it retains its entertainment value with the historical and emotional investment made in the subject.  9/11, is a day which will live on in infamy amongst our generation, and will populate the annuls of history books, alongside the other historic, infamous, military events of our century.  \\"No Easy Day\\" delivers the mail, putting you into the shoes of one of the most elite special forces teams in the world.  The story rings true, from what I've heard, to the message told to trainees on first day of BUDs.  That yesterday was the last easy day of your career.
B0076DELIG|3.0|The Black Box started out with a good premise, the story line unfolded slowly and it picked up when connections were made to solve the mystery.  Having inadvertently skipped about 50 pages or more, I was able to follow the plot without any unanswered questions.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|I thought this my have slow issues due to 3D effects but no. It is super quick. Gameplay is straightforward and the timer counts up so I don't feel frustraded by a termination if I'm not quick enough. I'm only besting my score. I only saw one small flaw as the drag feature tended to deselect a cube and select another random one but it didn't seem to hurt gameplay at all since matching cubes were easily found on a single visible screen. But it wasn't so easy I got bored either. I did have to rotate often but selecting even the slightest corner of a cube was no problem. Someone put a good effort in to the touch reponses. Well worth the download for sure.

B003VXMMTK|5.0|Tess is a beautiful girl. She drew you into her character and the strength she gained as a person through her struggle. She was inspirational to do what needed to be done, to be forgiving and loving with Angel considering the rape and how her parents did not support her, they used her and she unconditionally supported them. The ending was sad and I wish the story could have go on longer before she was killed in prison. It would have been great to see her happy longer with Angel before she was taken away for murder of that self absorbed,heartless Alec.  Thanks for sharing
B001OGRQ92|1.0|Bought this album for $4.99.  Downloaded the 'free' version as part of amazon prime.  They messed up the shipping and had to resend it.  Because the original order was returned, I got charged $9.99 for the digital download and then $4.99 for the cd when it shipped the second time.  Just wait until you get the CD then rip it.  So far my 'free' downloads have cost me $9.99.

I hope there will be many seasons to come.  It's amazing to hear how many people are now hooked on Downton Abbey.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!  Thanks!
B007O4XX9K|5.0|I enjoy listening to this album, and that is about all I can say.  I enjoyed Joe Walsh for many years, but hadn't bought one of his solo albums since &#34;But Seriously Folks&#34; until this one.  I now have to go back through his works and see what I have been missing.<br /><br />It seems ironic that in the title cut, &#34;Analog Man&#34; Joe Walsh describes himself as someone quite a bit unlike me, since I am a techie, and have been involved with computers and digital media for most of my adult life.  Yet the song was very meaningful to me.  It is as if it is general enough that I can see myself not quite fitting into the world around me, and seeking someone with similar attitudes to share life with.

The edge on the knife was not great. It was reasonably sharp, but it was not centered at all. The grind was visibly canted to one side, it will take a good bit of work to get it where it needs to be. I planned on making it convex, so not a huge deal, but I expected better. Overall, I'm happy with the knife, but the QC from the factory did not impress me.

B00ARF92HK|5.0|Forget Stallone's take on the Judge. This one is it. The movie is well thought out. It starts and ends with a bang. Urban and Thrilby are capable actors that shine in this truly underrated film.  Heady is also a capable villain who wants nothing more than her 15 minutes of Mega City fame. The corruption of that many people living together is evident and the methods of justice are truly brutal and justifiably violent in relation to their crime.<br /><br />Check this movie out for fun, action and a few laughs.
B001795SH8|3.0|Karita Mattila, Soprano; Violetta Urmana, Mezzo-soprano; Thomas Moser, Tenor;<br />Thomas Quastoff, Baritone; Swedish Radio Choir; Eric Ericson Chamber Choir;<br />Berlin Philharmonic; Claudio Abbado, Conductor.<br /><br />This 2001 Rome-based remake of Abbado's 2000-released Berlin Beethoven cycle seems to be preferred over his earlier version.<br /><br />Oh, that it were so simple.<br /><br />First off, the 2000 cycle features decent performances that one can either consider low-key or elegant. I choose the later. In fact, I tend to find the 2000 version better overall as a cycle. It's more in line with Abaado's general approach to music making over the years and features fine, well-balanced playing and clean open sound.<br /><br />This 2001 Rome cycle features less-cultured, more in-your-face playing from the band, with a recorded sound that is best described as raw and a bit shallow. Compare - for instance - the first movement of the Second Symphony in the two versions. While the \\"green box\\" cycle features some really wonderful and balanced playing, the \\"purple box\\" features raw and aggressive playing, especially from the French horns, whose interjections in the slow intro to the movement sound blatty and kinda ugly compared to the earlier set. This is symptomatic of much of the cycle to various degrees, and it comes off as a sop to HIP principles that seem to be a construct for Abbado, rather than something he embraces wholeheartedly. Yes, the performances have more surface excitement than the 2000 cycle, but surface excitement is overrated in my books.<br /><br />Considering how little time elapsed between the recordings of these two cycles, one shouldn't expect major differences between the two. After all, what would it say about a musician who lives with music for his entire life then has a major change of heart out of the blue? In the case of this 2001 cycle, I think it says that Abbado went off on a tangent to some extent, endeavoring to produce a quasi-HIP Beethoven cycle that isn't all that different from his norm.<br /><br />Both cycles share the same performance of the Ninth. Yet surprisingly enough, the recorded sound still sounds better in the green-box version to my ears. How can that be?<br /><br />The major complication to deciding which Abbado/Berlin cycle to get actually comes from the EuroArts DVD version of this Rome cycle, because the recorded sound on those DVDs is more natural and far superior to the sound that DG produced for either of their CD versions. In addition, the performance of the Ninth on the DVD set is a different performance than the one captured for the CD versions, a live performance that is notably superior to that of the DG CDs, especially in the case of the bass soloist Eike Wilm Schulte, a Wagnerian who sings circles around bass Thomas Quasthoff on the CD versions (the change in baritones is the only personnel change between the CD and DVD versions).<br /><br />If I had to recommend one Abbado/Berlin Beethoven cycle, I would say to get the EuroArts DVD version. The sound for this \\"purple box\\" DG CD version is supposedly drawn from this DVD soundtrack, but DG have somehow screwed up the transfer, making the purple box the least desirable cycle from the perspective of the recorded sound, even if it's the cheapest option dollar-wise. Which leaves one with the more-expensive green-box version of Abbado's first cycle as the one to get if you need it on CD, no matter what the marketing team at DG or Abbado had to say about their displeasure with the green box from 2000.<br /><br />Recommendation: get the EuroArts DVD version.P Beethoven cycle that isn't all that different from his norm.<br /><br />Both cycles share the same performance of the Ninth.

Also, a couple of the songs which they re-recorded from an earlier EP don't have the same energy and bite as the originals - look back to diydui for the better versions of Max Can't Surf and Wake Bake Skate.<br /><br />And definitely check out their videos on YouTube - both the live stuff and the 'official' videos.

B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|A polio victim living in an iron lung decides to lose his virginity...a sex therapist decides to  help him. Helen Hunt plays the therapist in a moving, sensitive portrayal that is courageous in its honesty. She plays in the nude, without fear, and with an amazing lack of self consciousness. Because the nudity is not portrayed as erotic, it is the most interesting nude performance I have ever seen. Hunt is as natural as a long married woman would be with her husband, and it is amazing to see Hollywood finally accept being nude as simply not having clothes on. This is a wonderful performance, and a great movie!

It is one of those albums that I can listen to repeatedly and it is great all purpose mood music. It isn't too harsh or loud. It is however distractingly bizarre so I can't give it 5 stars. The combination of nonsensical lyrics and the way the vocalist performs at times actually pulls me out from enjoying it as much as I could be. It feels like someone is trying to imitate Adam Sandler singing with that goofy voice that he does.

Different computers, cords, wall charges, etc..  nothing.  Pull the unit off the charger or cord and it dies.  This isn't a complete deal killer for me.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|Hey, I make joke in my headline!  Seriously, I can't imagine anyone reading yet one more raving review of this series and suddenly being convinced that it's worth the time, but I will say it emphatically... absolutely, one of the (if not THE) best TV series ever produced.  I came to the show late (only a few months back) as I have such a disdain for so much TV.  Only a relative handful of programs win my respect, and I think perhaps none more so than \\"Breaking Bad\\".<br /><br />The premise is simple- so much so that it's the reason I wasn't interested sooner.  How could a series built on a chemistry teacher turned drug maker/dealer sustain or rise above anything but some silly, stereotypical, profanity-laced, overly-violent drudge that is so much a part of our entertainment media.<br /><br />What I learned by about the 3rd or 4th episode is that it is written by people fully aware of the pitfalls and predictability of modern television; they have, instead created characters with such depth, and plot twists so complex, that I had become sucked in like some drug addict, suffering the joys and anguish and yet demanding more.  Characters are multifaceted, and you are expected to hate them and root for them at the same time.  This is such an amazing achievement in writing and acting... the acting, of course, is first rate.<br /><br />TV is really reaching a magnificent period.  Of course, network and cable are being dragged down by those bored enough to obsess over \\"reality\\" television and obnoxious crime stories.  Beautiful actors and actresses under 35 adorn most of the roles (being beautiful, smart, and fearless is also \\"reality\\" in the TV world of crime), all of which make shows like \\"Breaking Bad\\", \\"Mad Men\\" and a smattering of HBO shows, exceptional.<br /><br />Again, among the best, \\"Breaking Bad\\" rises to the top.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It's pretty slow for a little while, but by the end, SO worth it. It's truly inspiring-- thank you Mitch Albom!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I will only complain that, on my Kindle, the screen freezes every now and then.  Still, overall it works, and when it does, it's terrific fun.  My only other complaint is that I don't know if there will be additional levels and courses.  I hope so!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The only thing I would say is stick with it through the first 25 pages--it starts a little slow, but I found myself looking forward to reading it every night.  Development of characters is well done.  Nice way of switching gears to tell the story toward the end.
B005LAII80|4.0|Judge Dredd 2012 was a pretty good action movie.<br />I was actually expecting more sci-fi elements, but once I came to the realization that this was going to be straight action, I just went with it. It's definitely no \\"Blade Runner\\"<br /><br />Sorry, but I have never read the comic, so I was not familiar with the back story.<br /><br />In any case, if you're looking for a fun \\"popcorn\\" movie, you could do a lot worse.<br />The acting was pretty good, and definitely as over the top as you'd expect from something like this.<br /><br />The sound was really good.<br /><br />Video quality was good overall, but I did not like the \\"grainy\\" look that the filmakers chose to use in several of the scenes.<br /><br />I did not watch the special features or try the 3D option.<br /><br />Overall I would give the movie itself a 4/5 and the package a 4/5
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It gets harder the further you get.  If you like moving puzzle games this is the one for you. Very addictive.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is a simply breathtaking book. The intertwining plot and characters create a beautiful maze of ribbons, set in black and white. The setting, of course is magical. The ending makes sense. Although some parts are confusing, all dilemmas are easily solved thanks to the dates provided. Will recommend this to any and all.
B00003CWOL|5.0|if you were raised or are catholic and not too uptight about it to poke a little fn at it, gotta se this, George Carlin as an archbishop/Cardinal and Chris Rock as the `13th Apostle,do I really need to say more?
B003VANOFY|3.0|I tested this headset on two devices: a MacBook Pro and my Windows 8 desktop.<br /><br />Though the audio quality of this headset was quite good when listening to music in Mac OS X, using it with Skype was frustrating. In Mac OS X, there's no sidetone. This means that you can't hear yourself speaking at all. Because the headset is over-the-ear and does a good job of blocking external sound, it basically sounds like you're talking in a fishbowl. Though some people don't care for sidetone, I found it really frustrating.<br /><br />In Windows 8, I was able to get the headset installed using supported software from Logitech's website. This software allows for control of sidetone (which is nice, though that software isn't available for Mac OS X). However, the software crashed when I attempted to change the sidetone setting at which point the headset became unrecognizable by the software. I had to unplug the receiver and plug it back in again to get the headset recognized. This happened several times when testing settings.<br /><br />In short, it's a decent headset but I wouldn't recommend buying for Mac OS X if you're looking for a headset for use with Skype in addition to listening to music.
B000HEVALC|5.0|I loved this, have played it everyday since I got it.  Great to be able to hear history being made.  I loved all 4 of the singers, and together they are magic.  Having seen the Million Dollar Quartet, I was anxious to have a lasting momento, so glad I got this one of the real people and not the cast one from the show.  It is terrific, one of  my very favorites!!!!
B000002MJR|5.0|gotta have for the Dire Straits Collection, The masters doin it live Cant beat it.  All great tunes better than studio stuff
030758836X|2.0|I was eager to read GONE GIRL, the fabulously successful novel by Gillian FLynn. Frankly, as a writer myself, I find there is much to learn from most best sellers, even ones outside my own genre. The verdict on GONE GIRL is decidedly mixed. Flynn's descriptive powers and character building are excellent as is her dialogue. She infused both Nick and Amy (the POV stars) with strong voices and provides enough details about their proclivities and flaws to hook the reader. Initially. Midway through this novel (not really a mystery, folks), I felt restless and wanted it to end already. GONE GIRL is at best a psychological study, an intense and overlong look at the implosion of a marriage.<br />Although neither character was perfect (who is?), my sympathies resided with Amy. Nick is the type of smug bounder who populates both fiction and true crime accounts. There's a very Scott Peterson-ish tinge to this superficial, essential stupid fellow who has been indulged by women all his life. I also found Amy's passivity unconvincing in a woman who spent her life on the upper fringes of Manhattan society. Move to MISSOURI? Come on, no man is worth that. Better to do hard time in an east coast prison.<br />For the reader who enjoys wallowing in the mind of a protagonist, GONE GIRL should be a satisfying read. I fail to see how any mystery reader could be satisfied with a plot that is so trite you can see it coming early on in the book.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Different story and characters, same actors.  Season two has a lot more juicy twists without any of the confusion.  Most of all is has a GREAT and SOLID ending.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Very interesting story.  The history is fascinating.  I enjoyed the fiction intertwined with facts. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Oh give it a 5 star, no as Alpha & Omega was really much, much better.  But this is good and for adult entertainment, so us old folks enjoyed but questioned the sanity of this being for the young???

B009AVCAJ4|4.0|classic anime. looks good on blue ray. my only problem with it, is that its not 16:9 format. its 4:3 and not remastered. and if its going to be on blue ray these details need to be hit.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|Classic James Taylor.  If you like James and who doesn't you will enjoy this sound of the season.  Well worth the investment.
B000002G7E|5.0|The best record ever made and more influential than VU & N. Think of all the bands who sound more or less exactly like this. Jesus & Mary Chain, Roxy Music, My Bloody Valentine, Joy Division, early Modern Lovers, early Fall, early Feelies, Big Black, Nearly any band on Touch & Go, Human Switchboard, Josef K, Stereolab, Mirrors, Rocket from The Tombs, Pere Ubu, Suicide, Dream Syndicate, Luna, first 2 Eno albums, and on and on.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was great! I liked it and it kept my interest all the way through from the first chapter until the last! I would strongly recommend this book, especially if you are interested in the Navy Seals and a true boots on the ground account of what went on to take out OSBL..
1616550414|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It has information and artwork on almost all the characters you meet in all the Zelda games.  I was surprised to see the direction some of the artwork went with some characters.  It amazed me to see how the stories of the various games tied into one another.  This is a perfect gift for any Zelda fan out there.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|the game has exactly the same things as Minecraft PE and you only get like 15 min people should get Minecraft PE it is 1000 times better

B000N3SSVM|5.0|I was not expecting the cardboard sleeves, but all in all, this album is very well-presented. The music is high-quality and the DVD is crisp and clear. If you like this kind of music, you will be happy with Silent Shout.

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This has got to be Daniel Craig's best Bond outing.  I loved the other movies, the co-cast and the overall.  This movie simply had a bit of everything, and was able to deliver on many fronts.  That, and I don't really dig the &#34;emotionally impaired Bond,&#34; after his &#34;love&#34; died.  Great flick, IMO.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love to watch adventure shows/ movies. One of my colleagues recommended it to me. From her description, I was so amazed that I started watching it and then I knew right away that this is perfect for my choice. Sci-fi, action, adventures, horror - you will get all the feels :-)<br />I am watching season 2 now and that is even more exciting.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Great read. Espionage is a favorite genre of mine. While a little long, Clancy and Greaney keep you wanting to not put the book down. I thoroughly enjoy the Jack Ryan character. I give it four stars.
B002XTXG1G|4.0|Although this movie wasn't nearly as action-packed as I had hoped it'd be, I still found it pretty entertaining! Tom Hardy had a terrific performance.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|If you've seen the movie, you know what to expect on the CD. However, the soundtrack is missing many key songs. It's a huge disappointment.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|The story is engrossing from first to last scenes, the acting is superb, a bit of history comes to life as a simple tale becomes a great one.  We cheer the character successes and marvel that they are able to deal with the complexities of British society as well as they do.  In the end there will be a smile on your face.  .
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot of fun.  Time seems to pass quickly when playing.  Some people are annoyed with the pop up ads, they don't POP up until you start a new game and they are easily deleted in just a few seconds.  If you love card games you will love this app.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works like it should without glitches or any frustrations. Incredibly useful. I use it on Kindle Mac Windows &amp; Android.
B004ZISVRW|1.0|The dumbest movie I have ever seen. I think I actually lost brain cells watching this movie. Waste of time

B005MMY9A8|4.0|Surprisingly good. This movie was way better than I thought it would be. I would watch it again. Overall a pretty good movie
B009VB97EY|3.0|I found this movie a bit slow.  I had a hard time getting into the movie.  I think the guys were hot and the dancing really good, but the story line was kind of a snoozer for me!

B00846F1YW|1.0|On the kindle fire hd,  the last item on level two is hidden behind the top bar in the game, making it a useless game. Deleted.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you need to be able to make big chests;buckets;not allow zombies and spiders to climb up your walls and do not have baby animals.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The book is well and clearly written.  The subject is compelling and handled somewhat differently than most books about NDE.  It has great potential to be helpful to all who read it with an open mind.

B005CA4SJW|5.0|There really doesn't need to have anything else written.  It's the walking Dead. I've watched it all and had the episodes recorded on my DVR.  Now I have more room and I never have to worry about losing a episode!

B002SSUQFG|2.0|So i purchased this watch on amazon, expecting an identical version of the last two snk809's i had. What I got instead was a cheapened version made in Malaysia. My old watch the movement was made in japan, the stem was at 3 instead of 4. This watch is lighter than my old watch (i compared my broken watch the kids play with to the new one). I am very disappointed setting the day is a bitch.... It's water resistant and my old one was good to 200m. Bummer seiko sent me back to casio again. it does seem to keep time rather well but I really dont have a good feel for it because i change time zones frequently....I wish this was my last watch.<br /><br />Pros- Harlidex crystal (not sure it still has this either).... cheap....Not huge....<br /><br />Cons- Setting the time.....Not made in Japan like old version.....Not water proof.....
1476704163|5.0|As an animal--this is definitely something to be collected. As someone who slightly doubted her at first at her debut--this will definitely clear a lot of things up about Ke$ha, her background, and her fame. It's not so much a memoir as it is a sort of photo-journal-scrapbook of her life. Which is the perfect medium for a retelling of Ke$ha's life because she's the crafty creative type anyway.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who stumbled onto this product :)
0345803485|4.0|still reading it but plan to read the other two of the trilogy. xxx x xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
B0086700CM|5.0|yeah its fun... fun to swap with your wife and keep taking the high score from one another.<br />get it

B009EEFTMC|5.0|When I got my first glance at this game, I thought it might be similar to that sadistic puzzle from the 80's called Rubic's cube.  Thankfully it's nothing like that. Instead, it's more akin to mahjong.<br /><br />The concept is simple: Match the small cubes within the large 3D cube. When a pair of small cubes is matched, they disappear until all the cubes are matched. That's how one plays in \\"Puzzle Mode.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Cube Attack\\" mode, the game becomes more like a 3D Tetris.  You begin with a small size cube containing several smaller cubes.  One matches the smaller cubes as quickly as possible.  However, as time goes by, the cubes multiply and the size of the overall cube begins to grow.  If the overall cube reaches full size, the game is over.<br /><br />In both game modes there is a timer to challenge the player to play faster than previous games.  There is also a leader board to compare one's game stats with other players.<br /><br />I love this game. The concept is very simple, making the game easy to begin playing.  Watching the video posted on the game's description page makes learning the game easy. The 3D aspect of the game is cool and visually appealing.  I highly recommend this game. It's fun and addicting!
B00005YXZH|5.0|The title of this review pretty much sums it up. If you're unfamiliar with Wilco, you should change that. Jeff Tweedy is an incredible (and somewhat anonymously underrated) song-writer and if he has a masterpiece, this is it. It's an \\"album,\\" in the true sense of the word and although it has many great songs that can easily stand alone (Jesus, etc. is one of my top 5 favorite songs of all time), YHF is best when listened to in its entirety (much like the record that succeeds it \\"A Ghost is Born\\") and is a collection of songs that range from atmospheric to rockin'. Wilco transitioned from alt-country pioneers in their first two albums to more of a rock/pop sound with the album that preceded YHF (\\"Summerteeth\\") and transitioned further to create an experimental record that is multilayered and complex, while maintaining a certain simplicity. Tweedy ingeniously incorporates myriad instruments and sounds (bells, chimes, piano/synthesizer, glockenspiel, violin, cello and beautifully rhythmic acoustic guitar) in a way that's very easy on the ears. I fell immediately in love with this album (and the band) and it didn't leave my car's c.d. player for probably 2 months, in the fall of '02. It remains in heavy rotation and always will. \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is an absolute classic with a great back-story including how one of Time-Warner's subsidiaries rejected it for not being \\"radio friendly\\" enough only for a different one of its subsidiaries to release it 7 months later. Its original release date was 9/11/01, coincidentally containing political/war themes and a tower reference in \\"Jesus, etc.\\" with the lyrics \\"tall buildings shake, voices escape singing sad, sad songs...\\" On the album's cover is an artist's photo of the two towers in Marina, Chicago...the album was complete LONG before the attacks, adding slightly eerie tones (Personal and personnel conflicts within the band to boot, all documented in Sam Jones' \\"I am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" a documentary on the makingof YHF, which is very well done). It was ranked #3 on Rolling Stone's top 100 albums of the 2000s (behind and The Strokes' \\"This is It\\" and Radiohead's \\"Kid-A\\") Very simply, it is the best studio album in the past twenty years and one of the best of all time, in my opinion at least.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I have a extreamly wide rangeing taste in music . But if I was held at gunpoint and forced to pick two favorite artists it would be Lifehouse and Killers . The Killers are great . Brandon Flowers writes lryics that are very symbolic and almost poetic . This is a great album . In fact the almbum as a whole , I think is the best album they have made . I just like the album better than hot fuss .<br />Heres my favorites<br />Runaways- Just epic ! Extreamly catchy and powerful lryics .<br />Here With Me - Beatiful peice of music that is a slower more depressing song .<br />Heart Of A Girl - Beatifuly written with touching lryics and a amazeing melody .<br />Here On Out - Poppy upbeat rock . Different but it makes a nice standout for the album<br />Miss Atomic Bomb- After a couple listens this quickly became my favorite song on the album . Sad but powerful and catchy lryics intertwine with a melodious compostioin .If you havent already , wactch the music video for mr brightside and then watch the music video for miss atomic bomb<br />Awesome Album !<br />Bye It !
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Simply put, this movie is excellent! Emile Hirsch leads a great ensemble cast and portrays Christopher McCandless about as well as one can. It is a tale of a young man that chooses a simple, spiritually driven life over the materialistic life he witnessed growing up (in a dysfunctional household with an abusive father). It is aesthetically pleasing (including one of the best soundtracks ever, written and performed by Eddie Vedder) and very well acted. In a similar spirit to \\"On the Road,\\" it awakens the seeker that exists within many of us. It's narrated by his younger sister, with whom he shares a strong bond. It's beautifully sad. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend that you do.
B003SI605K|1.0|The Joy Luck Club should be condemned, not praised!! These women are sell outs!! First of all, why is the film only about the women? What about the Asian men? There isn't a single leading Asian male character! This film portrays marriage to an Asian man so negatively, while the rich white husbands are portrayed so positively. This is shocking because the Asian men I know are not like this at all. They are much more caring, strong and masculine than this. In fact, I have heard of many white husbands in the news who get drunk and beat or even kill their Asian wives. The Asian men I know are worthy candidates for marriage and are never aggressive toward women.<br /><br />These Asian mothers toiled through sweat, tears and blood, surviving a brutal war to come to America. And what do their daughters do in return? They forget all the hardship their mothers endured and marry the first rich white man they meet!! Instead of working hard for their money like their mothers, they want to be pampered by their rich white husbands and live an easy life of luxury through marriage! These women basically sell their bodies, beautifying themselves according to Western standards of beauty, while trying to sound educated so they can enter upper class society. They basically use their sexuality as a tool to move upward in social class through marriage. This, my friends, is a form of PROSTITUTION!! Whether these women are doing this consciously or subconsciously, they are engaging in prostitution. Is that really all an Asian woman has to offer society?<br /><br />This is an absolute disgrace and an incredible insult to all the real, hard working Asian-Americans in the United States, many who struggle in poverty and have no real voice in society. Any dignified Asian woman should realize that this film is Westernized propaganda, teaching Asian-Americans that white is better, that Asian men are terrible lovers, and to look the other way as their heritage gradually erodes. Tell me, how many objects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives? Can you find even one painting or vase?<br /><br />This film teaches Asian women to scorn their Asian men, even their own fathers, and to learn to \\"put up\\" with their mothers, who are an \\"obstacle\\" to be dealt with. This film does not empower Asian-Americans. Instead, this film brainwashes them to gradually despise themselves as they develop a crippling inferiority complex and a bitter sense of self-hatred. To make matters worse, The Joy Luck Club portrays the so-called \\"Asian-American experience\\" solely through the voices of women, while completely ignoring the male experience. This film is damaging and should be viewed as a negative scar that Asian-Americans must move away from.bjects of Asian cultural heritage can you find in the homes of their white husbands, even after marrying their Asian wives?

B009E9R1IM|5.0|All i can say is that it is Led Zeppelin and is a super album, a great compilation! It's truly worth every dollar I've spend on it.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Perhaps I should have started with this book when reading Flynn's novels, but since I read this after Sharp Objects and Gone Girl, I was a little disappointed.  Oddly enough, I think this is because this book isn't as dark as the other two.  There weren't the big twists like with the others and it read more like a regular mystery novel.  Even so, it is still a good read.  If her other books were a bit too much for you, then this would be a good recommendation.
0740748475|5.0|The Calvin and Hobbes series is a must buy, 10 yrs worth of comic strips for the true fan. I ordered a used book and it was in great condition. I saved $50. There are 3 Hardbound cover books if you buy the Hardcover version, each page giving you the dates that the comic strip was first published in a newspaper. Definitely a must buy for anyone who understands the true C&H sense of humor !
1589944607|5.0|If you and your friends enjoy the BSG reimagined series, get this game. It's a good game that will take about 2-3 hours (more if you sit and talk for a bit like we do). Plus, as the game progresses, you lose precious resources while someone (or some people depending on the number of players) work against the Galactica's mission.<br /><br />The delivery time was early and the package was good. The product itself was in perfect condition.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my god when I first got this I was soooo addicted to it!!!I couldn't stop playing when we went out to eat, nope I brought it with me!<br /><br />This game is awesome and addicting trust me!! Get it! now
B003B02O0A|4.0|Very well written. This is the first novel of Grisham and certainly it was good. The jury selection process and long n slow.<br /><br />Rest of the novel moves fast
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I usually love all his music but was a little disappointed with his newest cd.  The  songs were a bit too slow.  Most of the choices were similar.  I missed hearing the high strong voice that he does so well when he does opera.<br /><br />I do receommend it for those quiet timmes at home .
B007P06DO0|5.0|Paul Simon is great! I like the bonus tracks very much and especially the note book with the handwriting songs!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Nice job on making this book Rick Riordan you are a great author I rate this book 5 stars nice
B004RJMUJO|5.0|So much fun for the whole family. Different ways to play will keep you entertained for hours. Challenge yourself to beat your score.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's an amazing game with awesome graphics. All the new features like the zip line an mine cart are some much fun.  You can also use a save me which charges one gem and starts you right up again.The only tiny little problem that I have is that sometime I try to use a &quot;save me&quot; and it freezes then sends you back home and you lose all the stuff from that run but it still takes your gem.
B005HSL626|5.0|A really fun game with different ways to play. Keep you entertained for hours. Great for all ages. Highly recommend
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another delightful book by one of my favorite authors. A fast-paced adventure that kept me reading long after I should have been doing something else.<br /><br />Can hardly wait for the next book by this talented writer.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|I have been playing Freecell since it first came out from Microsoft.  I now play in numerical order, and have completed the first 15200 games, except 11982.  I don't play much anymore, but occasionally get the urge.  My problem with this app is that I cannot find a way to choose the game I want to play; they seem to be dealt only in random order.  The Freecell app from Mobility Ware permits selection, so I will remove the Brainium app from my Kindle.
0316017922|4.0|What I take from this book is that success may not always come from just hard work in some cases. This book gives an overview of the factors behind the success of others. I enjoyed reading through some of the stories and compare some of the information to books like Freakonomics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game in my spare time its a really cool game. I tell all my folks to log to facebook and compete against my high score. Its really a great game and I do love it.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This movie was the starting domino to the rise of the recent Avenger craze in my opinion. Sure the Hulk may have come out first, but Ironman with Robert Downey Jr, as Tony Stark ignited the fuse for the blockbuster that is the recent Avenger Movie
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|just awful dont buy its not worth the time the thought and its just one big mess after another don't download whatever you do don't get it
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Some episodes of this season as well as past seasons upload very slowly, cut off unexpectedly and skip but that could be high internet traffic in our area. Otherwise, the audio and video in HD is terrific.<br /><br />\\"Sons of Anarchy\\" is absolutely fantastic - great writing, plot lines and characters each season!  We have been really enjoying this particular series and highly recommend it.<br /><br />We do wish that Amazon Prime would update their video library to offer more FREE streaming of additional seasons of their offered series.  The final season (Season 4 of Sons of Anarchy) is dated 11/2011 and Season 5 has to be purchased - expensive at almost $32 per season (HD).  Also, Amazon Prime does not offer that many \\"free\\" videos/movies or series as part of it's yearly subscription fee so we have been majorly disappointed in the Membership and not sure if we will re-subscribe.  We are looking into if we may be better off subscribing to Hulu Plus, Netflix or Blockbluster to have more choices than what Amazon offers.

0810993139|5.0|My daughter loves this book. It's not just for boys. We own the entire set & she was devistated when she lost the first copy. It's not very often any kid asks for a 2nd copy of a book they've already read 10 times. Your child will probably enjoy it too.<br /><br />One cavet though-I think Greg is a bit of a jerk.(SPOILER-sort of)  You may want to talk to your child that despite all of Greg's scheming & talking bad about Rowley---Rowley always comes out on top! In evey book his attempts to be cooler by making Rowley look bad get turned around & succeed in helping Rowley. That lesson seems to be subtled & may be overlooked if not pointed out.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|The movie was awesome at tying all the loose ends up enough to satisfy me.  No matter how much I wanted the series to go on, at least I have this movie to give me a little closure.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Okay, so the actor didn't really look that much like Lincoln and actual history is really tinkered with in a big way. But consider the title! If you just watch the film for the fun of it, it is well done. I enjoyed the special effects and didn't worry about historical accuracy (for a change, as I'm usually a stickler for that!). It's a goofy movie based on a goofy idea, so just relax and enjoy. Don't expect too much from the film, but I did enjoy it.
B00A6SMN8I|5.0|I want this pack badly and my mom is getting me a gift for valentines day but it already passed. I hate when mattel does this. They put the price up really high on a popular product and people still buy it then they lower the price.<br />Im really sad because i wanted this pack. If you want any pack get the mummy\Gorgon girls. :3 thanks
1594487154|5.0|Pink ( Drive &  A Whole New Mind)  has done the world a favour.  This is never a book about how to sell, its a book explaining how sales permeates all our lives.  That said, Pink points out (and explains so well) very useful research (some new, some applied in new ways ) which will help anyone who ever needs to persuade, whether its a client, a manager, a child , a partner or a ticket agent.  This is a story that needs to get out into the wild. Those of us lucky enough to be paid to sell realize that persuasion and movement are essential to today's selling and we use this everywhere.  Way too many great ideas here, but one that stuck out for me was that problem finders fare better in life than just being a problem solver.  This is a skill which will outlast whatever changes occur in the marketplace.  A life skill book -perfect for a four hour flight.  Buy it and pass it onto your family.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I'm so in love with this, downloaded digital copy and have played it about 20 times in 2 days! I like true alternative not emo or pseudo rock that sometimes gets thrown in the same genre. I rarely skip tracks on An Awesome Wave, just let it play-only regret is that its only 45 minutes long as I am never ready for it to end. Amazing number of single-worthy tracks.
1451626657|2.0|I've always been interested in reading this legendary book, just not 450-pages interested, so I was pleased when my book club selected it and I was \\"required\\" to read it. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the end, I was much less pleased. I found the book's much-vaunted humor to be tiresome in the extreme, the characters far too cartoonish for me to care when bad things happen, and the entire enterprise to be about twice as long as necessary. Which is not to say there weren't some things to like: the non-linear, non-chronological structure is kind of interesting at times (unlike some, I didn't find it confusing), the convoluted machinations of war profiteer Milo Minderbinder are kind of amusing, and the sly insertion of anachronistic elements to signal that the book is about Korea and not WWII, are all worth mentioning. But the book leans far too heavily on extended circular conversations that reminded me of nothing so much as a series of Abbot and Costello \\"Who's On First?\\" routines. To be fair, a number of my fellow book club members couldn't read these without audibly giggling, but I (and others) found them to be very painful going. And it may be that the book just hasn't aged well, or has been succeeded by so much tighter satire ([[ASIN:0671422448 M*A*S*H]] for example) or ridiculous wars, that it just can't reliably have the subversive effect it must have at the time it was published. For military satire that's more contemporary, and to my mind at least, funny, try the excellent Gulf War farce [[ASIN:0802120326 Fobbit]].

B007REV4T8|4.0|I have always been a fan of the James Bond franchise.  To me, the movies represent a celebration of the very best in Western classical culture.  In other words, Bond is the antidote to Hip-Hop.  Bond speaks the language properly and dresses impeccably.  You can count on a Bond movie to take you to exotic places around the globe.  Ofcourse, James always travels in style.  Preferably in an Aston-Martin.  And his drink of choice is a true classic.  He wears his hair short.  He speaks English like he came from an upper-class, private boarding school.  And you will definitely not see this guy wearing an earring.  And so, in this latest installment, Bond stays true to the same formula.<br /><br />The plot of this one strays slightly from the typical Bond story.  Instead of trying to save the world from some genius madman, this time, James is attempting to protect M.  During her many years as the head of MI6, M undoubtedly has stepped on many toes, hurt a lot of people, and sacrificed the lives of many agents to get the job done.  As a matter of fact, the movie opens up with her deciding to sacrifice the life of two of her subordinates.  Including Bond's.  A former agent whom she had exchanged to the enemy, in return for a peaceful transition of the colonies to China has come back to kill M.<br /><br />To make matters worse, this former agent has stolen a list of secret operatives' names stationed in dangerous areas around the planet and blew their covers.  Agents and operatives start dying one by one.  The Prime Minister thinks it may be time to dissolve M's department, as an obsolete relic that is no longer needed.  As befits her high position, M is given the option to retire and a promise of recognition for her years of service to the government.  Bond returns to service, out-of-shape and slightly rusty.  His mission is to recover the list, and find the person responsible.<br /><br />This is the most character-driven story out of all of the Bond films.  Typically, Bond movies have been plot-driven.  Here, Bond and M reveal more about their pasts than in any previous installment in the series.  Daniel Craig probably gave his best performance to date.  And this time, Judi Dench was given the chance to really show her acting skills.  Unlike the few scenes and even fewer minutes that M normally gets, her character got a lot of screen time here.  Javier Bardem is perhaps just as good a villain as Le Chiffre.  He played the part of a slightly-insane, revenge-driven former agent to perfection.  Albert Finney, Naomie Harris, and Ralph Fiennes round out the cast.movies have been plot-driven.  Here, Bond and M reveal more about their pasts than in any previous installment in the series.

B003M6FGTE|5.0|I really am enjoying this show and can't wait for seasons 5 and 6!  Make no mistake, this is NOT a musical.  I've always felt that choir in the schools should be more performance than it usually is.  This show is great.  Great characters, realistic story lines.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|Gary has much talent - great guitar player and great voice. For me there are too many styles on the CD.  Over all I really like it - some are not my style.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|The movie that brought 3D into the twenty first century and started a 3D revolution in the movie industry, directed by James Cameron - the man who brought you the Titanic, which was only available as a bonus through the purchase of 3D Panasonic plasma TVs, is now finally available on Blu-ray. Award winning special effects studio, Weta Digital - responsible for bringing Middle Earth to life in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, returns to bring you awe-inspiring 3D effects and probably one the finest 3D movies ever made.<br /><br />The story revolves around the hero, played by Sam Worthington, who is paraplegic, replacing his brother as the link for an avatar developed by a conglomerate bent on an exploration to extract a precious rock embedded beneath the scared tree of the Navis in the distant world of Pandora, and having Sam, animated in the form of his avatar, attempt to persuade the Navis to relocated so that the company can level the land and begin to drill for the precious commodity.<br /><br />However, the Navis, refuse to move from their native homes and are drawn into a battle with the armies of the conglomerate, and witness the devastation of the native homes through violent bombardment of their homes; they, themselves, nearly defeated by the army forces until Sam calls upon Aeywa, the life force that interlinks all sentient beings and elements of nature in Pandora, which the Navis can tap into, for help, thereby, culminating in one of Hollywood's most exhilarating battle sequences ever captured on film.<br /><br />The Navis finally prevail, and the movie ends with Sam, who having his life force being transferred to his avatar and relinquishing his human form, and his new found race expelling the humans from Pandora.<br /><br />For an anti-war movie that constitutes an allegory for the Iraq war, it ironically relies heavily upon elements of war, not only as the climatic finale of the movie, but also to render the movie exciting.<br /><br />James Cameron is entitled to his own misguided tirade against the Iraq war.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game! !!!! its just like temple run. its adicting. its a fun family game! fun fun fun!
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|One of the few Woody Allen movies, featuring Allen in the leading role, but not directed by the maestro of comedy. Without a doubt one of his finest efforts on the silver screen.<br /><br />The story revolves around Woody's character, being obsessed with Humphrey Bogart, constantly having conversations with the imaginary muse, who constantly advices him on how to tackle women after his wife, played by the always captivating Dianne Keaton, had left him, and finds him being set up on match making dates that leaves something to be desired and are totally wrong for him, dates fixed by his ex-wife's husband - who also happens to be his best friend, and, finding the opportunity to rekindle an affair with Dianne when her husband is out of town, he is faced with the dilemma of whether to pursue his romantic interest with his ex-wife and jeopardize his relationship with his best friend or to respect the marriage institution between Dianne and her husband. He decides on the latter.<br /><br />The movie is interspersed with scenes from Casablanca from which it draws inspiration.<br /><br />Surely one of the best early films by the maestro and a classic work du art.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I gave it three stars because it only worked in the begging. now it wont even load. please fix this app.loved it.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I don't normally get attached to many films but this one is worth keeping if you like to watch movies over again. Nothing that I expected. Some laughter and much misty eye action. Even my significant other had to clear his throat.<br />If you were ever a high school student, you'll understand the theme. Funny, touching, and a movie that may lend itself to kleenex. You'll be surprised.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I like this type of adventure game. This one had great puzzles and a good story line. I agree with an earlier review, play it on the hard level. I can't wait until the next one comes out!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Started out great, but I guess I expected more action. I think if you're in a mellow mood and looking to just chill it would be OK, but honestly, the guys an idiot and it just angered me.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Solid game. Puzzles are fun and challenging and the story isn't half bad and makes sense. Great game for anyone who likes puzzles and challenges.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I like this game a lot. It is a really good exercise for your brain and fun too. I am an older guy and need all the help I can get.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is by far the best one of the series! If you think the first book was good this one will rock your socks!
0545265355|4.0|product came sealed and everything. it arrived quite fast. However, due to the material of the cover, two out of three were a bit torn. If people really care about this detail, you should buy the books at a physical store. I must clarify that the books themselves are in perfect state.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was a little worried about HBO adopting the book into a show  but they did wonderful. I must say you should read the book then watch the show or the other way around. The book as so much more information that makes it great. The show is amazing there is no way to knock it though
B00A88FLI0|4.0|It is a funny toy for Ninjago lovers. Even though kids have to follow directions to build this kind of Legos, that have fun an put their imagination on work.
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|This book is not an easy read - but then it's not meant to be.<br /><br />It challenges the preconceptions that we hold dear and have held dear for generations.<br /><br />I enjoyed the mixture of politics, biology and belief systems.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great writing, but detailing to sexual transactions in explicive terms, too often.  This teen age girl has a much too matured mind for the setting.  But well written and a great read with good story connections, especially.  I could not stop reading, and understandly my age may have gotten quite enough of the sexual graphics in the first paragraphs.  Great story line all the way through and that kept me reading....  I will recommend this book to book lovers, and if not a book lover, they will become one.  Thanks.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|It had an interesting premise told from the mother's point of view but it was so boring and dull. This should have been a much better movie.  I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun app, takes up all your free time but in a good way. Could be some more choices for clothing and tack for the horse.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is sick! It's like mah jongg on acid, floating in space. Totally enjoyable. Super simple, crazy fun. Worth at least ten times the price I paid.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great book if you're a fan of Nicholas Sparks. I recommend this for all the ladies :)
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is a rare case where the music may be better than the movie, though I loved the movie too! The music inspires thoughtful memories and moods I have associated with 2003, when the movie came out. Truly a classic!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This documentary is fantastic, just as good as PJ20.  It was really cool to see and hear where so many of my favorite albums came about.
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|The plot lines were pretty  good, however, I just got tired of the explicit sex scenes that went on and on. Frankly, many of these scenes were simply pornographic.  Such scenes detracted  from  rather than added to the story because and they were unnecessary. The same message could have gotten across without the degree of crassness shown by these explicit scenes. So, If you don't mind explicit sex scenes (the nudity, humping,noises etc) then go ahead  and enjoy. If you, like me, take no pleasure in watching others have sexual intercourse then you may want to pass. I did after the third one - enough was enough.

B002AKPECW|5.0|This novel was a little unforgiving in the way it introduces you into the universe Alastair Reynolds has created but it more than makes up for it with some interesting future tech ideas and great interplay between the characters.  I love the depth he is able to give to even his supporting characters and by the end of this book you really do care about the lives he has created.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|There is a good amount of space given to people who download the free app. Also this note app lets you bold, italicize, underline and create bullets in you document as well as lists you can check off<br /><br />The only downfall really is that the text in the documents is always small.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a cute and fun game for kids if u can't own a real horse this is the game to get you do everything like real life just not as hard of work it's all with the hands lol
B0063GORYU|4.0|Though in real life, I cannot stand spiders and all those creepy legs, I find this a fun and quick paced game. Just what I need for a break here and there throughout the day (or night). Rules are simple, but there is a challenge involved.
B0086QS7N2|3.0|Being only familiar with Rush's big radio hits, I took a chance on this new concept album on a whim. I'm always looking for new and interesting music. The album starts with a bang with Caravan, a hard-driving, pace changing song which hooked me almost immediately. BU2B also quickly clicked with me, although I don't care for its anti-religion tone. From there the songs seem to get too long and too repetitive for my taste. I would prefer lengthy solos without hearing the lyrics repeated ad nauseam. An exception is the beautiful Halo Effect (clocking in at 3:14). The album regains some steam and momentum with Headlong Flight, and finds a pleasing ending with The Garden. The digital booklet is beautifully illustrated and helps the listener to understand the story Rush is attempting to tell. Purchasing this album has spurred me to investigate more Rush music on Pandora. So far, I'm still partial to Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Subdivisions, and New World Man.
B0011WL8MK|5.0|A definite Collector's Item.<br /><br />This movie was made in 1942 when the War was on.<br /><br />We knew that the Germans had concentration camps, but we had no idea what was going on in them.<br /><br />Jack Benny is in his prime.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the lovely Carole Lombard died in a plane crash, a few months later. She was married to Clark Gable. It must have been terribly sad. If you get a chance watch her dance with George Raft on YouTube.<br /><br />Robert Stack is also in this movie. Amazingly, he looks the same in 1942 as he did in 1982. He never aged.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this movie.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|Gone Girl started well and I got quite absorbed in the whole plot, however by the middle I was thinking \\"these two people are so irritating\\" - I suppose by the end I justified it by saying to myself \\"it was just as well they were married to each other because they deserved each other\\".<br />A book that I couldn't put down because I wanted to know the final outcome, however the ending left a lot to be desired.<br />I expect I need to read another of her books to find out if (for me) all her books have irritating characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg this game is epic its like the game temple run that we all know and love but better and I didn't know that was possible lol. you have ziplines and mine carts and I think your in China or something. also instead of o bunch of small mutant monkey thingys there is a giant one that is on steroids or something and you even have curves where you have to tilt your device. this game is the boss and its free.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was a great game. Lots of fun and very challenging, can't wait to play another game. Will recommend this site to all my friends
0446693804|5.0|I have not read this book yet but am anticipating reading it soon.  I know it will meet all expectations of the typical Nicholas<br />Sparks outstanding books.
B008HFWF3U|4.0|This great an enjoyable but it has been 10 years since PMG has been in the studio! I wonder how many more albums PMG will release before they are done? These guys are not getting any younger. I know these are not great economic times to record and tour. Apparently Metheny once told The Globe and  Mail that PMG does not make money on the road. This must be factor. Now if we could just get people to stop being thieves and actually pay  for someone's intellectual property and also stop posting cd's on Youtube! Maybe they could do it( PMG old school) and do a short  tour and record the stuff in a week or two. They are high level guys that are certainly capable of this.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|I have enjoyed these movies ever since I can remember!  I grew up between 2 homes, my dad and step mom and my mom and step dad, where action and sci-fi movies were played often, so needless to say I grew up on a lot of the classics such as these films, Star Wars, Die Hard, Terminator 1 & 2, etc, etc.  These ones were a popular watch at my mom and step dad's house.<br /><br />I think the first one I ever saw was 2 back sometime around 6th grade or something like that, and from there I went on to eventually see 1 and 3...and then 4 when it eventually came out.  2 was the favorite movie until 4 came out, but we enjoyed all of them!  I have loved these films ever since!  Some of the best buddy action comedy movies ever!  Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are awesome together in these films, and their chemistry together on screen just flows well.  LoL, I love the chief too dealing with the 2 of them, and Mel Gibson's exchanges with the precinct shrink...classic!  Acting is all around pretty superb.<br /><br />As far as humor in action movies, you don't get much better than this, and they get funnier with each passing film!  The exchanges between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are often pretty comical.  Then throw in Joe Pesci in LW 2 and his shennaigans, and it just adds to it.  Then you throw Chris Rock into the mix in 4 and it's all a riot...4 is probably the funniest one of all of them.<br /><br />Action wise, it's off the hook!  Quality car chases, lots of shoot em up moments, explosions, all that action packed goodness!  Again, 4 probably takes the cake in this department too, having probably the most action of them all.  All of them are great though as far as action.<br /><br />As far as the packaging is concerned, I like it!  And a whole lot better than the DVD copies I had too, which were in what I like to call the stupid cases...those taller ones with the plastic bars on the top and bottom, and the plastic bar that you open on the side to open up the DVD, and you have a hard time fitting them into your shelves next to other DVDs because the stupid plastic bars snag on the other DVDs.  Yes...those kind of stupid cases!  I'm glad I finally have this Blu-Ray set because it meant that I could get rid of those stupid cases, LoL.  I'd been trying to upgrade to the Blu-Ray set for a while now and then my wife finally got it for me for Valentine's Day, (she's awesome like that), and I was glad to finally sell of the DVDs.  I'd say the only thing that I thought was funny about the packaging is that there's 5 discs, LW 1-4 plus a bonus disc, but the casing had 6 disc slots.  Why on earth would they make a 6 disc case for only 5 dics.  Seems kinda funny to me, but not really a big deal.  What matters is that I have some of my favorite action films of all time in high definition and in a set that fits much more nicely in my movie collection than the DVD copies, and I'm super excited!  :-)<br /><br />For any of you action lovers who have not seen these movies yet, what are you waiting for?  To any of you who love these movies and are looking to upgrade to Blu-Ray, do it!  Choice material!  I've marathoned these movies many times, and I'm looking to do so again very soon!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good so far. Takes a while to start up or change screens sometimes, but overall well done for a free app.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I was hoping for a bigger bang at the ending because it had my stomach in knots most of the way through, but still a solid novel.
B002TZ3C8G|4.0|From time to time I revisit an early book in some of my favourite series to see how they have stood the test of time.  Plum Island is an early book in Nelson Demille's John Corey series and when it was released it knocked John Grisham off the top of the US bestseller lists and held the no.1 spot for five weeks. I have just read  and enjoyed \\"The Panther\\", the latest John Corey adventure and wanted to see how the character had evolved over time.<br /><br />In \\"Plum Island\\" Corey is still a NYPD homicide detective and is staying at his Uncle's beachside house on Long Island recovering from three, almost fatal, gunshots in the course of duty. His neighbours, Tom and Judy Gordon, biologists who worked on Plum Island, the site of animal disease research for the Department of Agriculture, are murdered and Corey is hired by the local police to consult on the murder investigation. A smart and attractive detective Beth Penrose leads the team.<br /><br />Inevitably the investigations focus first on the possibility that the Gordon's were involved in selling viruses or vaccines to terrorists. The investigation team gets packed with FBI and CIA agents tripping over themselves to prevent a life-threatening tragedy.<br /><br />Corey quickly dismisses the Plum Island disease connection and works on his own to look at unusual things in the Gordon's lifestyle which is well overspent. They have a rarely used but very expensive speed boat with a missing ice-chest, and recently purchased an isolated block of land on the beach-side that can't be developed. He also looks at their membership of a local historical society and meets and is instantly attracted to the president of the society, Emma Whitestone.<br /><br />Corey is still full of smart alec wisecracks, but IMHO they are better in \\"The Panther\\" as he matures. Most people are disarmed and annoyed by his attitude which makes him look a bit idiotic - but it really is a technique to keep people off balance so they don't realise how smart he really is.<br /><br />I enjoyed revisiting this early Demille which has an interesting and somewhat unusual plot. The characters are well crafted, and the plot moves around and around, finishing with an exciting but somewhat unbelievable boat chase.<br /><br />On balance I enjoyed \\"The Panther\\" slightly better which I gave 5 stars. This earlier book is a good read, but slightly lengthy and the plot is a bit unbelievable so I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />My favourite Demille book is still \\"Word of Honor\\", which IMHO is one of the best novels about the Vietnam war.art he really is.<br /><br />I enjoyed revisiting this early Demille which has an interesting and somewhat unusual plot.

1597801585|1.0|I tried very hard to like this book, I really did. Unfortunately I couldn't make it half way through. The characters were flat and unlikeable, the constant use of foreign words was both distracting and unnecessary. The world impossible and poorly thought through - no oil, no electricity, and apparently no solar, nuclear, hydro, or wind power to generate it. I found The graphic sex scenes completely over the top.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|This model is an attractive and durable watch for everyday wear.  Helpful, since it must be worn almost every day for it to stay powered and keep close to accurate time.  As with a wind up watch, this model requires motion of the arm to keep in charged.  No batteries needed...just wearing it provides the power.<br /><br />Would be nice if the watch face was more illuminated at night.  The hands do glow, but not all night.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|Just the fact that this product has been reviewed over 1300 times says quite a bit about Game of Thrones. There's very little that I can add to what has already been said---this is an excellent series considering that its a television adaption of George R.R. Martin's best-selling novels. In fact, I've never seen a television adaption that did more justice to its source material. The writers made a remarkable effort to stick as closely to the books as possible. There have been a number of criticisms from other reviewers, some of which seem fair and others which are way out in left field in my opinion. It is these I'm going to address in my review, and by doing so, offer a review of Game of Thrones itself.<br /><br />1) It's not like Lord of the Rings, and therefore is not true fantasy:<br /><br />My response: hogwash! LOTR was written 50 years ago and targeted to children and teens. LOTR was a great series, both in literature and film, but it is not the definition of fantasy. GOT is for adults, it's fresh, and it's author, GRR Martin, specifically took great pains to correct or address many of the faults found in traditional fantasy epics; that is, untarnished, invincible heroes who can do no wrong and never die. In GOT there are no angels or saints, and anybody can die at any time. This makes for great edge of your seat viewing.<br /><br />2) It's graphically violent.<br /><br />True! Both the books and the television series are extremely violent and gory. For me, this adds to the constant tension and sense of danger, and brings a real-world grit to the show often lacking in traditional fantasy. But for those who do not like a lot of blood and violence, this series is not for you.<br /><br />3) It's gratuitous and pornographic.<br /><br />Agreed. That's HBO for you. The books had their fair share of sex, but nothing like what's in the show. It doesn't bother me personally, but it also brings nothing to the story and seems to be there for no other reason than to titillate over-sexed heterosexual males. There is far more female nudity than male, in fact, almost comically there is an exposed breast in every third scene. Again, not a problem for me, but it adds nothing at all to the entertainment.<br /><br />4) It's soap-operatic. Again, true. It's the nature of epic television series in general, but this is a soap opera of huge proportions.<br /><br />5) It's boring.<br /><br />Huh? On what planet could GOT be boring??? It's chaulk full of violence and intrigue, with dashes of romance and revenge, mystery, horror, and magic. This is the definition of entertainment!<br /><br />6) It's cheap-looking.<br /><br />I'm on the fence about this criticism. For television, it's at the very top of production quality and attention to detail. For a feature-length film, no. But this is a television series, folks. We're never going to get movie-quality production in a television series---the budget and time constraints just won't allow it. It looks really good for what it is.<br /><br />7) It has a homosexual scene.<br /><br />Yes, unfortunately it only has one, and there's not much to see other than two young men nude from the waist up. They don't even kiss. If you can watch a series with over 500 heterosexual sex scenes, and find fault with one homosexual scene that doesn't even contain sex, then you need to move to another part of the world---say Uganda or Iran or somewhere else stuck in the dark ages.<br /><br />To sum up, GOT is a fantastic series, as good as television entertainment gets. However, if you demand unicorns and elves in your fantasy, turn squeemish at the sight of blood, and do not want to see gratuitous nudity every 3-10 minutes, than GOT is definitely not for you.
0525953728|4.0|This is a terrific story about the account of the SEAL team which managed to find their way to killing Osama Bin Laden.  Mark Owen does a tremendous job capturing the real-life/human element of what SEALs deal with on a day-in/day-out basis.  His description of the raid and the multitude of tasks required from not only the SEAL team, but countless individuals across numerous agencies to make the raid a success was gripping, informative and invigorating.<br /><br />My only hangup on this book is that it does not give an adequate background of what it takes to actually become a Navy SEAL.  Having read numerous books on SEAL training, I felt that this book left some out some necessary background information on being a SEAL.  Before reading this book, I would highly recommend reading the book \\"The Warrior Elite\\",[[ASIN:B001HZQWKO The Warrior Elite]] \\"One Perfect Op\\"[[ASIN:0380809206 One Perfect Op: Navy SEAL Special Warfare Teams]] or \\"Lone Survivor\\"[[ASIN:B0035YDM4Y Lone Survivor]].  I believe this would give readers of \\"No Easy Day\\" a much more enjoyable reading experience.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is such a wonderful/beautiful  movie. One of the greatest romantic movies ever!! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!
087795223X|5.0|Triple was excellent, but of course I am a Ken Follett fan.  A great way to stay away from other modern media. How old fashion is reading a hardcover book?  The younger folks may miss out on this type of entertainment altogether, it's a shame.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|This is an excellent movie! It is about two gorgeous women-who end up having an incredibly romantic encounter! I highly recommend!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I liked the last version. wording is small. doesn't flow nice when switching accounts. don't like at all. wish I could undo my update.
B0002KVULG|3.0|I LOVE this movie-but the DVD i received skipper/as well as completely stopped 4 minutes from the climactic ending. I still highly recommend it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|On my Kindle, it showed this book was over 60 hours long. I am still reading it. I stopped midway to watch the movie on Hulu because I was impatient with reaching the ending. Great literature, poetical, rich details of life in the 17th century. We should have been assigned Les Mis in high school....maybe we were and I slept or skipped....but I sure appreciate it now!
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I LOVE this movie!! I would highly recommend it to anyone! It has beautiful scenery, is well acted, with a wonderful plot!

B003UBTX6S|4.0|I wanted to read this series before my teens did. If  enjoyed it very much. It does get annoying to have such a cliffhanger at the end pretty much forcing you to purchase the next book. If you read one, be prepared to read them all!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have so enjoyed the series. Now I understand all the love and interest in the series. I can't wait to catch up with the current season.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm sitting here trying to come up with words strong enough, or perhaps even descriptive enough to say how I feel about this book. While reading it, I felt a sense of clarity come over me. Like it was a book written just for me.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Again this series is just to great. If you have never seen one, just start with the first and you will be hooked for life
1451637500|5.0|All these books are AWESOME. LMB has a gift for witty and humorous dialogue that is rarely seen, and you will quickly fall in love with Miles Vor'Kosigan.

B005RDF2NA|5.0|I sure could not. Shrek keeps you entertained from the moment you start to the moment you end. Another great series for family entertainment
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this nice little clock is very easy to use, and has not let me down yet. thanks guys! I will use this one for a long time.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game and sfind it very addictive.  I like that you can earn points instead of having to pay for extras.  The game is fun and you only really play against yourself.  I haven't had it lock up on me or freeze the screen.  I have no complaints
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I love this movie so much I had to own it. Another great movie that all ages can enjoy and never get enough of watching it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game but I think it might encourage children to run on train tracks but I like the character it's cool.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|You get tangled all up in yet another great family entertainment movie. Another fine production for people of all ages
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love to Play it it is so amazing I wish the brave one was for free I.agine how many people would play that but I like the first one better than anything
0307346617|5.0|This is a great book. You already know that. You don't need me to tell you to get this and enjoy it. Make sure that you read it before the lame movie comes out with the same name. The book has no central character (Brad Pitt is made up for the film). The movie will almost certainly suck, but this book should not be punished for that. This is an amazing story and it is really well written.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it. thanks for this app. calculator very easy to use. nice and big and easy to read. and it is free!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicting I love it though you just can't stop playing it! It's fun for me and my friend and I do recommend it (you can never stop playing)
1926778103|5.0|The artwork is absolutely fantastic, but the thing about these artbooks is that you can never fully open them for fear that the binding might just tear apart. It was painful to flip through the pages so carefully as normally you'd want to actually flip through the pages with ease.
B0013XS8A2|4.0|I've been a Mike Oldfield fan for years and had planned to own \\"Music of the Spheres\\" for a long time, yet did not take the step to order it. This year I finally did so and I'm so glad the day arrived when I could listen to Oldfield's epic composition.<br /><br />It clearly has strains of his older works, which makes this instantly recognizable. That occasionally could leave one with a sense of \\"duplication\\" and perhaps even some unoriginality, however it also links his music together, which I'm happy about. This is possibly the most listenable of Mike Oldfield's CD's, since the songs are all smoothly melodic, without any abstract or obscure-seeming diversions. It's harmoniously flowing and touchingly beautiful and is still enjoyable after numerous listenings.<br /><br />I only wish the whole piece could be performed worldwide by live orchestra. It's so amazing and should be receiving much, much more attention. If I could, I would shake both Oldfield and Jenkins's hands with a definite \\"Bravo, gentlemen. Bravo!!!\\".
1926778537|5.0|The item came in perfect condition, delivery was fast and smooth. Item is exactly as described, lots of goodies to be seen in between the pages. Artwork is top notch!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|If the movie is half as good as the book, it will be an instant classic. Inspirational. Heart warming. Sad. Terrific.<br /><br />I finished it at the gym, and before I realized it, I was tearing up in front of all the muscle heads.  Glad none made eye contact or I might have ended up prey.
B00005K424|5.0|This is a simple, easy-to-learn game of strategy to play with children around 7 and up.  I seriously need to be focused and look forward a few turns to set traps and to make sure I don't slip up.  Otherwise, I get burned by my 4th grader.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Every song is excellent. And considering the same album is at least ten dollars everywhere else it is also a real steal!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Read this book if you care about how we bring up and educate  kids in the US.<br />Paul Tough tells stories that are both heartbreaking and inspiring. What does it take to succeed? you may be surprised!<br />The difficult part is how to be sure that all kids get the support they need. and we are not talking just about underprivileged kids. Privileged kids have issues which have some of the same roots.

159420411X|5.0|This is not a technical book (… it actually mentions only one formula, Bayes’ theorem …) but it gives a broad and sufficiently deep sweep of different areas where prediction is used nowadays, from financial crises, over baseball game bets and so on till climate change and terrorism attacks.<br />The book is well researched, resulting in a full 55 pages of explanatory notes at the back, while unearthing some anecdotic gems in the process such as : “…prior to Gutenberg … the going rate for reproducing a single manuscript was about one florin per five pages (about 200 US$ in today’s dollars) .” and “ …At one point, [Fisher] argued that lung cancer caused cigarette smoking and not the other way around – the idea, apparently, was that people might take up smoking for relief from their lung pain.”  ; further there is the enticing story of how Kasparov finally lost out to the chess computer Deep Blue (with some surprising twists indeed!) and the clever observation that “if you can’t spot the sucker in your first half hour at the [poker] table, then you must be the sucker” ( whose veracity is subsequently shown based on statistics.). Also the holy grail of predictions, the stock market, gets a thorough treatment, starting with the “Efficient-Market” hypothesis and showing why it does not always work like in “…members of Congress [in the USA], who often gain access to inside information about a company while they are lobbied and who also have some ability to influence the fate of companies through legislation, return a profit on their investments that beats market averages by 5 to 10 percent per year, …”.<br />In short, the real life examples, facts and interviews bring the probabilistic theory to live and show how to adjust your thinking, how to take into account your (implicit) biases in order to make better predictions for the future, a feat very useful indeed in many areas of our lives.<br />The only thing I regret is that, not being from an Anglo-Saxon country, I missed out on the intricacies of Nate’s baseball statistics and tribulations.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never heard of colleen Hoover before I found this on Amazon.  I read the reviews and I thought why not?  I wasn't expecting much, but I was shocked. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It was absolutely amazing. I didn't want it to end. It made me laugh, cry, and angry along with the characters.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent book!  Have not yet seen the final book of this trilogy.  When will it be coming our?  Soon, I hope...  I have gained a great deal of historical perspective from Mr. Follets writings.  He is rather liberal,left wing, but is usually as even handed as he can possibly be, given his prejudices.

1568363931|5.0|This is my favorite cookbook. If you are just starting to get into bento-style lunches, then get this book. The recipes are pretty simple, even the Japanese ones. It also has full color pictures of the bentos so you can see how they all come together to make a lunch. She teaches you about the basics of bentos like the types of boxes, how to cook rice, and how to make onigiri.

0140282033|4.0|This gentle story follows one Vianne Rocher, a wandering woman who comes with her six-year-old daughter, Anouk, into the tiny French hamlet of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes.  She falls in love with the place and decides to put down roots there for the first time in her life, and accordingly she opens a chocolate shop right across from the town church.  The priest of the church is Pere Reynaud, a dour man with ugly secrets who takes an immediate dislike to Vianne and Anouk, and the battle is joined between the hippie and the priest.  Caught in the crossfire between these two enemies are a number of the townspeople, some of who side with the priest and some of whom side with Viannne.  Things never get too out of control, though, as this book is essentially about people's basic decency, and the ending is a surprise for the priest and a funny one at that.  Along the way we meet about a dozen interesting characters who pull for this side or that one and add their unforgettable voices to the struggle.<br /><br />The book is not all sweetness and light, however.  The priest harbors dark secrets from his own past, there is a wife-beater and his downtrodden lady, and one of Vianne's best friends is slowly going blind and is fighting it all the way.  But the overall tone of the book is one of uplift, and having faith in people.  It is a good message, and an enjoyable book, and a fun read.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I won't be looking further for dictionaries, this is the best! I liked it before I bought the pro the pro is the frosting on the cake. I also like that it pronounces the word if you chose to do so. Thank you for this app.
0802798225|2.0|I was originally going to give this 3 stars, but I read The Sky Is Everywhere right after that, reducing my opinion of this book even further.<br /><br />With all of the rave reviews on this site, I thought I would like this book. Sometimes I like to leave literature behind and just read romances. Sometimes I like to leave romances behind and just read young adult romances. I decided to do that, and this book was really disappointing.<br /><br />Fabulous Brittany Ellis has to be lab partners with lowly gang member, Alex Fuentes. In an incredibly contrived plot, they become friends due to the immense amount of time spent together. I don't know about you, but I remember having lab partners in high school and being able to work with them just fine in school while not ever even exchanging phone numbers. But, they become friends and then more. Yawn, snooze, blah.<br /><br />My problems with this book:<br />1. THE DIALOGE. How did this not bother anyone else? I found myself constantly cringing!! Someone definitely needs to give Simone a wake up call as far as teenage dialogue goes. I'm 20, and I'm almost positive that many phrases in this book haven't been used since 1999. Groan-worthy examples:<br />\\"Rockin'/sexy/smokin' bod\\" (wash, rinse, repeat - used over and over speaking about the heroine)<br />\\"...leave these lame-os alone\\" (when has lame ever been used as a noun??)<br />\\"He was dissing me\\"<br />\\"Sexy mamacita\\"<br />I wish I could remember more. I found myself actually embarrassed for some of the main characters and the way they talked.<br />2. Cliche. Good girl meets bad boy. Bad boy is in a gang. Good girl is perfect, but she's not really perfect. It's all just an act. Good girl sees that bad boy is actually good. Good girl helps bad boy be good too. Now it's about a good girl and good boy and how happy they are. Except they can't be happy forever. Problem arises. Boy and girl manage to overcome problem.<br />3. Brittany is so offended that everyone judges Alex for being in a gang. Guess what!!! GANGS KILL PEOPLE. No wonder people judge him! She acts like it's so ridiculous, when it's NOT.<br />4. The epilogue. Oh goodness. It was terrible. I find that I rarely like epilogues in books because they tend to be overkill. In this case, it wasn't just overkill. The author took the story, put it in the middle of the road and ran over it with her car. Repeatedly. She then picked the story up and pounded it over every single one of her readers' heads. When she was done with that, she put the story through a food processor and rammed it down everyone's throats while repeatedly screaming, \\"Happily ever after! SEE???? THEY LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!!\\"<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. Then I got about half way through and wanted all the characters to shut up already. 2 stars for effort, Simone. Maybe next time.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|Too wordy and self-serving for the authors pet peeves. Otherwise the book is pretty good reading for his ecomonic insights.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Best drama on TV in years. Captivating plot, sub-plots, characters. Leaves you wanting more. The international cast is wonderful, so a man has said
B0098460O4|5.0|Incredible, hands down my favorite record in recent history. I simply cannot wait to see these two amazing singer in a live venue
B0040I09RM|5.0|How did I miss this show for the last 5 years....Watched all 5 seasons in a week, can't wait for season 6
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|It may not be factual, but if I wanted all the facts I would watch a documentary. Easy to follow movie with suspense around every corner which kept me glued to the tv. Plan on watching a few more times which I can't say about many movies at all.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|When I saw all the commercials for this show. I thought I would hate it. One day I found nothing on tv and decided to give it a chance. I was instantly hooked. I bought this set along with season 5 and watched it in about 3 weeks! Each season gets better and better. You will not regret buying this set. It's very addicting though, just a warning.
075695195X|4.0|I had read a third of this book about a year ago and for some reason I had left it there.  I guess it hadn't clicked or I wasn't receptive of its style.  However, I got the reading itch a week ago and decided to browse my bookshelves, effectively re-discovering it.<br />  In just one night, I read half the book, finishing it a couple of days later.  It is definitely a recommendable book that I was a little surprised belonged to the young adult fiction category.<br />  The main character is a young magic apprentice that has a penchant for getting himself in troubles much more perilous than what would be normal for his age.  The second main character is the djinni he summons, a sarcastic, ancient \\"demon\\" that is the primary source of humor in the book, especially with his condescending footnotes explaining all kinds of magical stuff to the reader with a very biased tone.<br />  So if you are in the mood for a quick read of light fantasy, ignore the hideous cover of this book and delve in its rich storytelling.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Everything about this show is superb. Acting, special effects, plot, cinematography. This may be one of the greatest TV dramas of all time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the  costumes and the interactions of the family with servants, just so human. Great story, scenery and intrigue.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|A view that I've held for some time, it is refreshing to see it elevated, if only slightly, in the public awareness.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there is only so much to be said on the subject and I feel like Sam Harris belabors the point.<br /><br />Although his view that the illusion of free will is itself is an illusion was provocative and I view I'd not heard before.
B00992CF6W|1.0|wont let me download and shows a downloading error and so I cant download it so then I cant play
B003MOHX8S|5.0|If you like music that sounds like it came straight off of an action movie's soundtrack, this album is for you. Their work is described as epic and that sums it up well. I am an amateur writer and I get a great deal of inspiration from music. Two Steps from Hell is like a buried gold to me. Every time I listen to a track I get all new visions of scenes for my books. Buy it, listen and love it! You won't be disappointed.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Nice easy reading book. Enjoyed the story line. Did not expect the ending. The main character touches your heart from the  beg to the ending.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This is a great album. My favorite tracks are Blackheart and Dark Ages, but every track is great. Personally, I prefer the songs without lyrics. These are the most inspirational, but I am sure you will find much to enjoy in this album.
0736063684|4.0|Nice book with good, simple instructions, do's and dont's. A book for anyone that want to get more out of their training.<br />Colorful pictures that are easy to understand.<br /><br />Advanced athletes that already know most excercises and how to perform them probobly won't get much out of it.
B0049CVUNG|4.0|This is a beautifully produced concert version of the beloved musical.Alfie Boe and Norm Lewis are simply amazing as Jean Valjean and Javert. The orchestrations are stunning. Te only weak link is Nick Jonas as Marius. Poor casting there. He needs to atsy in the Pop genre because his voice does not compliment a classical sound and thre is nothing Pop about Les Miz music
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Pi is a fabulous character and y o u really get to know and care for him. The plot was slow and I thought, from all the hype the book is getting, it would be a real p age Turner.
B00846F1YW|3.0|It is more fun than part 1. The  GAME is quite relaxing and the objects are quite clear. I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is fun and i enjoy it very much. i just wish that i didnt have to wait as long for some things
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The entire family enjoys this game from ages 6 and up we all think it's fun.<br />Would recommend to anyone with or without kids.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It crashes after I try to click out of an ad sometimes. Would be rated five stars if it didn't crash so much

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|While I was surprised at the end, it wasn't as engaging as I hoped it would be. Not sure if I'm going to read the sequel or not.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|This album is a great continuation of Muse's unique flavor blending of rock, classical, and at times punk and techno. A fairly new ingredient in this mix is the more blues chord progressions and hints at funky rhythms.<br /><br />&#34;Panic Station&#34; takes on this new approach, with Matthew's vocals reminding my of tones found in more indi bands such as Vampire Weekend or Ok Go. But not to worry, he will not disappoint those who crave his eerie and classic singing quality and ceiling shattering high notes.<br /><br />Certain songs, such as &#34;Follow Me&#34; and &#34;Big Freeze&#34; are reminiscent of soundscapes that U2 created on their Joshua Tree album, an inspiration which I enjoy immensely in Muse. Guitar solos are more prominent throughout this album than in previous releases, and the guitarist in me jumps for joy with these well composed and improvised runs.<br /><br />The last two tracks, &#34;The 2nd Law: Unsustainable&#34; and &#34;The 2nd Law: Isolated System&#34; stand out from the rest of the album with their mostly instrumental arrangements. &#34;Unsustainable&#34; will reverberate through listeners who enjoy Muse's blend of classical and industrial/tech flavor, as well as those who enjoy Muse's critiques on current society and politics. (On a side note, any sustainability studies student will now have a truly awesome theme song). &#34;Isolated System&#34; provides a cool-down for the previous track, blending soft yet morose piano with a collage of audio and soundscape to tell a story without &#34;lyrics&#34; per se.<br /><br />My only nick-picky part of this album is the &#34;Explicit&#34; rating; I've listened through the album and I found only one use of f***. I understand the needs for rating systems, but really? Seems like a bit of an overkill. Oh well. :P This all round well balanced and crafted album gives listeners the classic flavors of Muse while evolving and adding new ingredients into the mix. Highly recommended for both old and new fans alike. :)
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I love this book!! It's a fabulous read that never gets old, and is still applicable to today's world. I read this every year at Christmas.
B0091JQH76|5.0|Poulenc has a humorous flavor which is unrivaled.  I don't think there is any other 20th century composer who's jocularity comes through with near the liveliness.  If you want to experience a *different* flavour in 20th century music.... check it out.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|makes my experience very easy when using my new kindle fire h d and i would get it again if i had a need
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book is written well, and has an amazing story.  It really delves into the true nature of humanity, and the evil that can exist in all of us.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|The Heavy has a new reworked sound blending ska instrumentation with old electric R&B. A pleasure to listen to and it just makes you want to sing along and tap your feet.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This TV series got pulled after the first season, simply because the pilot, which sets everything up, wasn't aired first. I blame the network for this, NOT the TV series. It's a completely original TV series about space pirates and cowboys, going against the oppressive, universal, corrupt government. If you have seen the movie Serenity, this is the TV series it was originated from (same actors and everything). If you see this and like it, watch Serenity.
1616550414|5.0|From the introduction by Miyamoto, the great insight provided by the progression of the concept art accompanied with notes, the timeline, to the outro by Aonuma, this amazing hardcover is about as perfect as it gets. I would have liked to see more concepts from the earlier games but it's understandable why newer titles had more coverage. A must have for any long time Zelda fan and a fun flip through for the casual/new fans.
B005R32L66|1.0|I love skype. I use it as one of my only forms of communication (outside of in a game). That being said, I was highly disappointed when I went looking for a skype program that I could use on my tablet. This particular one would not install for me, it just said that it did not install, every time I tried. When looking for an alternative (perhaps, a communication lump app that added skype), I couldn't find any options. This was highly disappointing for me. Tablet is a cruz,
B0066WJLU6|1.0|i hated it for my kindlei,  i  would use differnt  app , if you have a light on ouyr phone it would be ok !!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love the firefly season, and I love the serenity movie as well. Without seeing the Firefly series, you may not completely understand the story, but if you love space pirates and cowboys, this movie is awesome.
B009ZE27US|3.0|It was okay  just not what I expected, but that's okay it started interesting conversations. I would  recommend to younger age group.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i love this app. i use it alot for my baking and to keep in check.... thank u<br />I would recommend this to everyone<br />:-)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I don't know what makes this so much fun, but I love it.  Very addicting, so don't start playing if you have something to do immediately.  Recommend to everyone.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|This movie is my preferred type of romcom - not completely predictable and actually could be based on reality while still being cute and entertaining. I definitely recommend giving it a try if you've ever experienced the dating scene.
B000VX4X1I|5.0|Been wearing this model of Timberland shoes for more than ten years.  I walk lots and wear out the heels in less than a year.  Repairing sole or heel is very costly; this new pair from Amazon cost less than repair of my oldest pair.  This is great shoe for those who need Timberland's size range; comfortable out of the box, great a week later.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Never knew how beautiful the background of the movie was until, we viewed this blue ray<br />The story line is great and J. Wayne nailed it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Great price and service. I received my dvd in a couple of days. I would use Ray's video company again.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Product is in Perfect  CONDITION, Plays outstanding.  Just what we anticipated and ordered<br />Price was excellent and delivery was rapid and well protected.
B00499NHLC|3.0|Not wild about the selection of actors to play Sherlock Holmes, but the storylines are interesting and the acting is good.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Having grown up on Maui, the music of this motion picture brings me home again. The movie and it's music makes me homesick.  Beautiful scenes, and I have spent many hours of appreciating Hawaiian traditions and music.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Great singing!  Yeah!  I think that this gives the viewer a better idea of what Les Miz is, was and should be.  If it's a musical, Just sing it!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Performances were excellent.  Very compelling & interesting material to consider.  We are looking forward to the release of Season 2.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Enjoyable characters, fun plot, clean humor.  Had to wonder about the music.  It just didn't feel natural, but all in all, a fun movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love  0.6.1 Sky Qoutz<br /> And more when is the next update?<br />it is a good game to become a great game for the world People lie when they say there is no monsters
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This series is a classic. I have watched the complete season as well as the commentary. I will treasure it.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Not the best 007 there is but in the top 3/4. Lots of action but a little drawn out near the end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|his game has alot of interesting and addicting games. really good for when you are board. I played this game all summer long and loved it.  Games might be challenging, but they are fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 5 year old loves this game. He cannot get enough unfortunately. It is very similar to Tomb Runner however I think the graphics in Subway Surfer are  more kid friendly and i am not a mom who approves of many if any games at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it! I give 5 &amp; 1/2 stars i wish i could change modes from creative to survival. Maybe thats the next update.... anyways buy minecraft. play it. You will love it. Cant wait till the next update. Peace out - Silvershimer
030726999X|5.0|I have read all the books. This was a great ending to the trilogy. This was quite enjoyable. I could not put this book down.
B004VWH3KI|5.0|Book is still the Best in Science Fiction, as-well-as the Best Sci-Fi Author, Ray Bradbury! Great condition; still a Fantastic Read!!  love it!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Good game to play with grandkids, 5 & 6 y/o.  Easy to undersatnd for kids their age, and it was easy to control.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Fantastic series - can't stop watching!!  We give it 5 stars - keep 'em coming!  Can't wait to see what happens next!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My 3 yr old loves this game. Her favourite thing is to stir up the feed. Requires good hand eye coordination.
B00062PN6I|4.0|Buy them.  Great price for a very nice pair of pro headphones.  Comfortable and very versatile.  I may just pick up a spare pair.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Series hits a high point with Ghost Protocol. Great action film w/ quality acting, cool locations, and a nice bit of humor
B004LWZWGA|1.0|While in turn the first movie was a decent start, the rest of the franchise was a failure but to be honest the whole franchise was doomed from the beginning due to christopher nolan's inexperience to direct a master piece. Nolan is a garbage director and his batman franchise sucked. Personally i wouldn't mind having the legendary 'Tim Burton' back on board to save this monstrosity and put these average and ill informed movies back on self where they belong. This movie in particular did not offer anything spectacular and rather came across with major cheesy and lame effect's and sequences and i'm glad i'm not the only one who sees this and thank's to those who can think for themselves and not be brainwashed by the media into thinking this garbage franchise is good.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Cable arrived quickly after I ordered it. The connects easily to my Nexus 10 and does what it is supposed to. The magnetic connection seems solid. While it snaps securely to the tablet, it is easy to remove as well. My short experience with it so far feels like it is charging faster as well, though that is not the main reason I wanted one.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It is a great book. I wish that there were a way for a follow up now that Chris Kyle is gone.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I just love this series and highly recommend it.  Everyone in it plays an excellent part.  Anyone who liked Upstairs Downstairs will like this.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I ordered this app and paid for it, but it never arrived on my device.  This is the second app I've ordered and haven't received.  I hope SOMEBODY at Amazon reads this.  I love my kindle fire, but this is inexcusable!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I have this app for both my phone and Kindinle Fire. My wi-fi printer is not listed. I don't know who to contact about this so I posted a review here
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book.  Different from the usual Nicholas Sparks love story books. Highly recommended. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Too many sub-plots away from the main plot!  Good read, but too many characters. Very disappointed that on of Clancy's main characters is retiring.
0446547573|5.0|This book is amazing, I cant wait to see the movie...Katie is so strong and powerful and true inspiration and Alex is HOT HOT HOT... Plan on spending the whole day enveloped in this love story... Best story since the Notebook...Could not put the book down. Getting ready to start reading THE LUCKY ONE today.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. It's fun and it helps pass the time.  It can be a little bit addicting though. :) My kids also love to play this when I let them on my kindle.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|AMAZING! Eaily one the best western animations ever created. a MUST see! DEFINETELY NOT for kids. adults will love it for sure.
0345803485|1.0|This is, by far, the worst book I have ever read. I would rather be condemned to an eternity of reading William S Burroughs' Naked Lunch than have to read another page of this simpering, horribly written, juvenile drivel. And I'm a bloody masochist! I like pain!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is a great game to play in your spare time. It is also very fun to play and once you start the game for the day you really get hooked to it for really most of the day.  Also it is I think a neverending level game so you can play if forever and forever. I really like it and I think that you will like it to partly because you can help animals but the animals look completely fake so that part isn't that exciting to me but you might really really enjoy it maybe for even the rest of your life. So that's all for now hope to talk to you soon but for now I just want to say goodnight and I hope that you have a wonderful rest of this year and the years to come. Goodbye!
B008TMA1LY|2.0|Ok so when I first bought this app, I was like ok, this is actually kinda fun :) but I'm level 8 now and I'm on day 28. This game is harder than it looks. I thought every customer was going to leave because I am so slow. I am a teenager and this games looks like it was for probably a 6 or 7 year old and I can't even make it past a day anymore without getting frustrated!! The customers get too impatient, too quickly! :(

B0013LL2Z2|4.0|I haven't watched this movie as of yet, only because I have purchased many movies from and through Amazon. Just haven't gotten to the letter 'L' as of yet.  I first viewed Logan's Run on TV a few years ago.  I thought the movie was pretty dang good, considering the lack 0f the phenominal audio and video effects we see in today's movies.  The plot was well established, and the acting was very good, considering what the actors had to work with at that time.  I thought the director (s?) could have done a little bit more with what Logan and his lady friend found when they escaped to the 'outside' world.  That part was really minimized I thought.  All in all, it is a very good family SCE-Fi movie from the \\"old days!\\"
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love this game. It's a really fun hidden objects game, but with a story attached. The story is a little cheesy at times, but it's fun and it keeps you playing to find out what happens next. I would recommend this game.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Exquisitely acted and strongly written, Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" sets out to disprove the notion that explosions and nudity are required to keep a modern audience interested. This it accomplishes, and much more.<br /><br />The film revolves around the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution, fertile ground for a tale about an American icon who has been so examined that the most recent film about him prior to this threw vampires into the mix in an attempt to say something new.<br /><br />The importance of this particular fight and the historical grounding for the film is established early. Once set, Spielberg expertly crafts the tension, creating suspense if not actual doubt about the outcome of the story. Not an easy task, but a challenge superbly risen to in this case.<br /><br />The pacing is admirable. The time in the theater is never a factor, despite the truth that it is a long movie. The obvious anticlimax is somewhat avoided, although many will see the wrapping up as influenced by the recent trend of multiple endings such as Peter Jackson played with the Lord of the Ring's finale. But it is necessary, as onscreen closure helps cement the importance of what has gone before.<br /><br />The threads that need tying off are joined with elegance and the emotion all the more raw despite it. The end of Mr. Lincoln's tale is, of course, well known. If the movie seems self-aware of the fourth wall at this point, and it does, I find that a trap that would have been all but impossible to avoid. Instead of attempting it, Spielberg uses it to his advantage. It allows him to create depth.<br /><br />The temptation to prematurely anoint the principals involved in this film with Oscar front-runner status grows from the very fact that this was always going to be a movie which required abnormally powerful performances. The subject matter is too overwhelming, especially in an election year. Yet I would be extremely surprised if at least nominations were not forthcoming in great number. Already, Daniel Day-Lewis is receiving justifiable praise... and he will be nominated. So will others, and so should they be.<br /><br />I am aware that my great interest in the original subject matter influences my feelings about this film. I would advise you to ignore that obvious bias in this reviewer, and get yourself to the theater. This is rare work, and it deserves its chance to play with your emotions as it did with mine. We can only hope that critical and commercial success will result in more attempts to make films that achieve this much impact with acting and writing rather than visual effects.<br /><br />~ James Glass for Glass House Reviews<br />(c) 2012 Glass House Reviewsorthcoming in great number.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern gets 5 stars!<br /><br />\\"People see what they wish to see. And in most cases, what they are told that they see.\\"<br /><br />Morgenstern takes a place of dreams, wonder, oddities, sleight of hand, excitement--a place where the young at heart and the open minded are allowed to believe anything can happen--and turns it into an intricate game; a battle of life and death. It's the story of a love that cannot be, one that could mean the death of the circus and the player that loses the game.<br /><br />The characters are vivid, complex, and magical. I purchased the book on Amazon, linked Whispersync for Voice, and it was as enchanted an experience as a night at the circus.<br /><br />Susan Stec, author

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|After watching all the Alien and sequel movies it was nice to have this prequel..It explained alot and was a good movie in and of itself..
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Best book I've read to date. Kept me intrigued and guessing right to the very last page.<br />Next to nothing was predictable, and when I thought I'd guessed the outcome, it took Another turn!<br />I recommend it to every woman who likes a little mystery & intrigue that is laced with amazing romance without the smut.<br />I'm now going back to read all of Kate Morton's earlier books.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Plays well but does not save your game progress upon exit.<br /> Next time you try to log in the game starts from the beginning and not where you left off.
0131480057|5.0|As a long time Windows systems administrator, I inherited several Linux servers from someone who left.  This book got me up to speed on Linux quickly.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|They went overboard on examples of drugs, sex, and drinking....Pervasive swearing, sex & drugs....gross. They spent little time on the actual plane crash...There was very little to keep interest & one of the worst movies I've seen to date....very disapointed....
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book, for lack of a better word, is intriguing. One minute you're crying and the next, you're laughing. You feel every emotion that comes with each page, each moment, each person. And for those of us that read almost on a daily basis, maybe we wouldn't expect something so great in only about 300 pages. But it is. This is one book I'd actually like to see be turned into a film. Mainly because these are feelings and situations that the media has and will always be afraid to get involved in.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|We ordered this because of all of the people we know who like the show. It wasn't what we expected (more comedy) but we do enjoy watching.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I have found these earphones so frustrating because they are the best for running and the sound is great, until 2 or 3 months later when the sound goes out in one ear.  This will be my 4th purchase of them.  I'm going to try to get some kind of warrantee or refund next time.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|Animated feature films that kids can enjoy are a-plenty, but films that are able to capture adult audiences are few and far between.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I loved this book- Travis is hot and Abby is snappy! You will fall in love with them instantly!! Great read, finished in a day!!
B008J34466|5.0|Best P!NK album ever! Most of the songs are a fast paced catchy kind of tune, and the few slow songs have great lyrics. All the songs have great lyrics. Buy this album, if you like Pink, you won't be disappointed.
B008476HBM|5.0|best book ever!! draws me into it so much! makes me stay up real late at night to read it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is great, I couldn't put the book down.  The characters was so real, they made you feel like your  there were there for most of the scenes in the book.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I often look for books for escapism from the worries of life.  At least as something uplifting.  This is not that happy story.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I really got this because for a long time I have wondered what all the Angry Birds fuss was about. Well, it reminded me of Mario and Luigi (sort of). The graphics are really good, especially for on such a small screen. Grandma could actually play this once she figured out how to do it, but it is not my type of game. I may come back to it once in a while just for a change of pace.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|It is a part of my movie collection.  A touching metaphor of the romantic and harsh life of a cowboy - the west.  Excellent writing &#34;Larry&#34; and of course great acting.  One has to see this movie several times to enjoy, first the story, then the the story again, then the acting, last the photography and sceneries.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Often times these hidden objects games are so simplistic at the beginning they become a bore before they become a challenge. This is not the case with this game semi challenging from the first mission on.The story could use a little more development and their seems to be a bug with the Facebook option, but other than that a very enjoyable and stable puzzle games. I look forward to more games from this DEV.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|My friend and I watched this when it first came out and she really LOVED it. So, I bought it for her for Christmas and she LOVED it as a gift! The disc didn't skip, it wasn't scratched, it came in a factory case (nothing flimsy or fake), and had excellent quality. GREAT BUY!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was pretty good I loved all of it<br />Hxhhfgyufgdhh h chapel f f d f d f r f
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I built a PC with gaming in mind and this processor is wonderful. Couple this with a good video card and plenty of memory;  you cannot go wrong. Intel does it again. I can only imagine how good the 3rd gen processors are. I highly recommend this one because it is a little cheaper than the 3rd gen processors and performs very well. Plus there are plenty of motherboards that can use it, which will bring down your system build cost.
0756405890|1.0|I can't understand how this book has so many high reviews.  Maybe I am different or am missing something but I did not enjoy this book at all.  First of all it is a Harry Potter rip off. Boy orphaned by evil wizard has a hard life then goes to wizard school where the he makes enemies of some of the professors while being the darling of others, makes enemy of spoiled but powerful rich student...etc..etc..blah...blah....blah.  Except, unlike Harry Potter, it is all way too long and extremely boring. Once he gets to the schoool nothing much happens, .... at all.  We learn nothing more of the evil wizard, he learns no new valuable skills as he seems to know just about everything before he gets there.  Nothing remotely interesting happens.  The whole \\"dragon\\" thing at the end was just dumb.  I just wanted thus book to end.  No way will I read the second as I hear it has even more of the same.<br /><br />I just can't figure out how so many people seem to love this book.  I thought it was quite terrible.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I got this as a gift for my sister who is most fond of MGM musicals. She loves the dancing and is a real Shirley Jones fan. She highly recommends it to fans of MGM 50's musicals.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the better 007 movies, you don't have to be a fan of Bond to like. This movie is why Blu-ray is still relevant. Even the dark scenes are not murky, good detail good color.
034580404X|5.0|I got this as a gift for my former girlfriend. She thought it was a little kinky for her taste. I never read it, but she did. She did not sell the books so I assume she enjoyed them. You be your own judge.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is a great way to have fun with your food. I would want to be a ninja since you never eat fruit . The creators of this game should also make fruit ninja but instead of slicing fruit, you should be chopping vegetables! :)
B007M45PMU|5.0|I purchased this based solely on the one song I had heard and couldn't get out of my mind.  Hey Ho, or Ho Hey...whatever.  It sticks with you.  Note that I am not a spring chicken and it had me on my feet dancing and stomping.  My husband came in to see what on earth I was doing....anyway, you can't classify this as any specific type of music.  It isn't really folk.  It isn't really bluegrass.  It isn't country or Irish or zydeco yet when you listen to the songs you hear influences of each.  I'm really impressed with these musicians and will look forward to seeing what they produce in the future.
1451695195|5.0|A wonderful and thought provoking book.  As we get older and think about life after death, this book will provide something to consider about our own lives.  I have always been interested and read some of near death experiences.  I believe you will find this man's journey quit interesting.
B005LAII12|5.0|i heard great things but waited to get the dvd to watch i did not want to see it on the big screen but worth the dvd so i can watch it again from time to time
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this series--when it was on TV, I was watching football.  Received as a gift for Christmas....Now I can watch it whenever!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Not what I'd call a great fantasy read. Characters aren't very well developed. Certainly not up Martin or Rowling even if the review says so. I did get the next book in the series I'll hope it will improve.
B000001H00|4.0|My problem is, I do most of my listening with a set of excellent Sennheiser headphones (the best I could afford).  And Milstein's occasional humming just bugs me.  It spoiled my experience of the Chaconne.  (He's not as bad as Glenn Gould, who's OFF-KEY humming/mummbling can be heard without the aid of headphones.)  Actually took the headphones off to see what was going on while listening to this recording.  Nothing.  Backed up the track, listened again, there it was.<br /><br />With respect to the humming, the first instance is the Fugue of Sonata #1 between 2:19 - 2:24.  There are two other instances in that movement nearer the end.  In the Chacconne, at 3:33, 3:36-7, 3:52-:53, 5:47, 5:53-:54, 6:00, 6:02.  In the Adagio of Sonata #3, the first instance is 0:06-:08. It's not my intention to cite every instance, nor tear down the work as a whole.  However, in response to comments that I am in error, one implicit, the other more direct, I wish to be clear about my remarks in regard to \\"humming\\".<br /><br />I like the music, owning 9 artists' performances of the Bach Partitas & Sonatas for solo violin, among them; [[ASIN:B00000417N Bach: Complete Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin]], [[ASIN:B000003FIT Bach: Sonatas & Partitas]], [[ASIN:B00077F96Q Bach: Partitas for Solo Violin]], [[ASIN:B001SB1KHW Johann Sebastian Bach: Sonatas & Partitas for Solo Violin]], and [[ASIN:B000001GXY Bach: Sonatas & Partitas for Solo Violin]].<br /><br />In Milstein's DG recording, I like the tempos (nothing fast feels rushed, nothing slow drags), the dynamics, the phrasing; I would compare all very favorably to the most preferred of my others.  I decline to choose a favorite, though this one isn't it.  All in all, I found it quite enjoyable, making its annoyance all the more lamentable.<br /><br />This review is of my local library's copy.  I mean to find the earlier EMI recording.  Maybe he doesn't hum on that one.  It's such a small thing, I know.  It's probably not something one would notice in their living room ... I may not have. (Heifetz would have rather faced a firing squad than be caught humming.  I'm sure of that.)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't notice it in the car ...<br /><br />I know enough about playing to be truly appreciative, and enough about music to engage in intelligent conversation (for the most part). I can articulate what I like, what I don't, and why. But criticism of a musician's performance or their ideas on interpretation from me would be ... blasphemous. Lastly, a note about how I choose to assign stars to classical music:<br /><br />5 = a definitive performance for the opus and/or performer -- a must have;<br />4 = a very enjoyable performance, essential to a well rounded musical library -- a definite keeper;<br />3 = a pleasant listening experience, but if the time comes to thin the ranks, find it a good home elsewhere;<br />2 = disappointing in one or more respects - wish I hadn't spent the money -- donate it to the library for their frequent fund-raising sales, maybe a Philistine will buy it;<br />1 = donate it to the Humane Society to sell in their thrift shop. (It's for the dogs ...) And discourage anyone I know from making the same mistake.d notice in their living room ... I may not have.

B00846F1YW|4.0|Hours of challenging game time...  Great fun app... challenging. No issue with my kindle fire... works great.. would highly recommend for all ages...
B00992CF6W|4.0|well how do you use dropbox to get texure packs and stuff like that I don't know how it all works please tell me
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I love these lights they will come in handy during the next power outage that occurs. Hopefully I won't need them.
8866130907|4.0|This is is just what I was looking for.  I slightly prefer the one page per month calender view in the 18-month version (this version's month at a glance has several months in one page), and from reviews, I knew that this didn't have it, but that was the trade-off for having just the 12 month.  Anyway, another great planner.
B007SGM084|3.0|The Trilogy Bundle was okay but it could have been done in one novel. I feel so many scenes were repeated too often, same scene, different page -- you knew what was coming next.I did not recommend it to anyone.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|like the movie was really good too bad that I missed it in the theaters.  Will recommend to all to watch
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This is one of the few great JRPG style games that were seen a lot on the NES &amp; SNES systems. It allows you to save pretty much anywhere. Has a good if slow story, and is worth picking up. I was lucky enough to get this title free a while back. Though I will say its worth the price. If your an old school gamer who loved the JRPG style games of the NES &amp; SNES generation then you can't go wrong with this game.
