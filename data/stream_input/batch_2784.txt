B000JMKQX0|5.0|I picked this story up originally at the airport when it was first published several years ago. I had quickly snatched it up after recognizing Max Brooks on the cover (as I had my zombie survival guide frequently read sitting at home). I picked my world war Z book back up after seeing the movie release.<br /><br />This was such a fun way to read a zombie novel. By going forward in time AFTER the zombie war and reliving it through a vast array of different accounts.<br /><br />Each story/recount is unique and meshes reactions of the story teller with their heritage. I highly recommend this to anyone that loves the recent zombie bandwagon that has appeared everywhere.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|I just had to get this album.  Old man and Ohio are just the tip of the iceberg with my favs.
1476733953|5.0|I was unable to put down the wool omnibus. The story reminded me of playing the Fallout video game so I was able to visualize what the vault looked like. There was such underlying sadness and emotion in the stories. The points of revenge, murder mystery, and love are sophisticatedly integrated into the novel. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes post-apocalyptic stories.<br /><br />When picking up the book and reading the title \\"wool\\" I thought of sheep... after reading the story I think the subtle title and how it integrated into the story was one of the most clever titles I have read in a very long time.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Love every song on this CD. Never really listened to this group before now. Very update music and well done.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|This was awesome. The premise that everyone wants to spend their hard earned money on fake animals was both sad and hilarious at the same time. Philip's writing is hard for me to follow sometimes (like in his story Ubik) but this was a good read from beginning to end. A timeless classic- it is amazing to read this story and totally agree with other people that originally read it the late 60's.<br /><br />This is one of the top sci-fi stories of all time.
B008133MDK|5.0|He really is. Martin Freeman is also great. Moffat and Gatiss art terrific writers. I would whole-heartedly recommend this to literally everyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This has become one of my favorite stories or all time, the progression of the characters was fantastic. I totally did not expect the ending. I was greatly impressed with the quality of this story.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|listen to this one all the way through. Bet you'll go back, again and again.Some of what she's sharing may stick with you well beyond your last listening. Mavis's persuasive voice is powerful gospel.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This story was much more than I expected. The best part is that it relates to our current day situations, the probable future, and our past all at the same time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed video games growing up, or modern day massive multi-player online games looking for a great read
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|and getting a taste of the title track. Now the &#34;dang&#34; thing's stuck in my head. Authentic and enchanting; a good way to get real during a P.C. day.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|What can I say about Nicholas Sparks......have read all of his books.<br /><br />Love his characters and settings.....feel like you are there as he is telling story.<br /><br />Never boring.....waiting for more...
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|I saw the Tavis Smiley interview & Hosseini explained that the book started as short stories which made a lot of sense to me & it took his fantastic writing to weave expertly the characters together. He writes such human stories that transcend borders & religion!
B0063IH60K|5.0|ITs's just a fun game to play does not require a lot of thought....love taking my Kindle along to DR's office<br />or other places that I have a waiting period and can pass the time and surrounding noise does not interfere....
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a great game. Finally I am very pleased with a good game on the kindle. So many of the games are not worth the download time. Thank you for something worth playing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love books that are different and give you a different perspective on life I instantly was hooked I recommend it to anyone that wants to have  a good read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this game is a creative fun game for horse lovers. i think this game is very entertaining for me
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is quite good and I would recommend it to other people. The game makes you think and make your brain work.
B000QY9WOU|5.0|Totally Cher, she and her team have a wonderful concert.  I wish I could've been there in person! Are you Cher fun? Must watch if you are.
B005DJREJS|4.0|I thought it was a fairly good show. Its not for the young or immature. I thought the guidance counselor was really funny. A lot of sex for the actors just being teens I wouldn't have minded so much if they were older, but I guess that's what our society has become.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun and thought provoking. Graphics are pretty good. Even my 7 year old is intrigued! Have to remember to sometimes connect the clues on the side. I would rate this 3 of 5.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I honestly thought that this app far exceeded my thought from looking at the picture. This is a very fun game to play with friends family your children and just anyone really. I mean hey you can even ask your mailman if you want but let your dog get him first!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the more realistic approach in these books.  Kept you on your toes from romance to suspense !!  Loved it!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game. I think kids would like to play it. I recommend the game to the people willing to play it.  It fun game to play. Just try it once and you'll see what I mean
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved this book!  It is funny and truthful at the same time.  The story is told from the male's point of view, which was a surprise and a nice change.  The romance between Drew and Kate is emotional, engaging and hilarious.  The secondary characters, especially Drew's sister, are well-written and developed. I can't wait for the next book in the series.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Fast paced and hard to put down. I enjoyed it from start to finish.  I will read more of Ken books
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you love music and comedy, you can't help but love this movie. The tunes rock! You go Anna Kendrick!
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Besides conveying a strong sense of what it might feel like (and smell like) to be in a U-boat submarine during WWII, the alternating periods of extreme fear and boredom seem to accurately portray a submarine sailor's life in a war time situation.  Not for claustrophobes. A great movie.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I enjoyed the different approach to the zombie apocalypse stories that seem to be popping up everywhere. The movie is cheesy, but cheesy can be endearing and it is!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|it is a good movie, but the others in the series were better. for one, I do not like subtitles and they made it hard to follow.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|My wife and daughters like this movie.  If they enjoy it that much, it must be good.  I had no problems with receipt of this product.  It arrived in perfect condition.
B004SVM7BW|2.0|Adobe Reader does just what I need without jumping through hoops like this one.  Read the review about all the limitations.  When I read that, I uninstalled it.
0802473156|5.0|The best advice I ever got! I highly recommend to anyone who wants to raise their lovelife to a better level.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I specifically wanted to watch this one episode of Season 5 - without a doubt it is my all time favorite episode of all TIME.  I have been watching Dr. Who for a very long time and I am impressed with the writers every single time.  BUT BY FAR - VINCENT & THE DOCTOR is my ALL TIME FAVORITE - EVER!!!  For those who have never really understood Dr. Who maybe this one episode would clear up some of the mystery.  True, he's NEVER taken anyone character to show them how they influenced history because of him being careful not to change history; but for some reason this episode worked.  I CRY every time I see this.  After watching the Dr. Who series for over (ok - wait for it) 35 years (out of the 50 years it's been on BBC) this BY FAR stands out as a CLASSIC Who episode.
B008CP92ZO|4.0|OK, I'm going to give this 4 stars because my wife and I both liked it - but we're glad we didn't pay full theater price. Paul Rudd and Jenifer Aniston are solid performers almost all the time, and they didn't disappoint here. Their chemistry might have been a little better, and I think it would have been interesting had Rudd been cast as the more \\"let it all hang out\\" type with Aniston as the uptight one, but no real complaints. The other characters were funny if one-dimensional - but we weren't really expecting deep, soulful insights with a movie like this. Rudd's brother was hilariously repulsive. The only thing that was a little annoying to us was the neat, wrap-it-all-up-in-a-nice-knot, Hollywood ending, with the obligatory meanies.<br /><br />This was one of those Hollywood movies that got us thinking how, with a few tweaks and a commitment to true artistry, they could have actually ended up with something that would have something serious and lasting to impart - rather than an amusing, forgettable trifle. Imagine a version where (SPOILER ALERTS): (1) Aniston and Rudd don't get back together, and the tensions between their love and history and their desires for enriching life experiences are more seriously explored; (2) The commune's breaks with modern-day culture aren't quite so hollow and comedic; (3) The leader of the commune isn't such a one-dimensional villain but instead is a real person trying to make the best of an impossible situation; (4) The theme of how a commune can be so liberating in some ways, yet so stultifying in others, is more deeply explored.<br /><br />But I'm going to give it four stars because this never pretended to be that type of movie.<br /><br />PS: The title makes no sense, really. They weren't lustfully wandering. They were just two yuppies who, through a confluence of circumstances, ended up in a commune for a while.
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|The score by James Horner elevates this Trek film from 4 to 5 stars.  Star Trek movies are best when they are submarine movies and Wrath is the best.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|As always SAMCRO brings the action. The plot twists are awesome this season and there are a lot of unexpected surprises. Can't wait for season 5 to be available.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|super movie great plot and good twists and turns to movie i highly recomend for adult viewing  watch multiple times
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This continuation of Kvothe' s tale is just as riveting as the first. It shows how he grows into manhood and makes his name legendary. I'm literally breathless for the next book
B0090SI582|3.0|This is probably my least-favorite movie with Wolverine in it, as the first 4 movies he was in were really good, and IMO this one's just \\"ok.\\"  I would recommend renting it if you're interested.  A convoluted story with not much action lowered the score for me, but as always, Hugh Jackman does an excellent job as Wolverine.  It seems like this movie was just a place-holder between X-Men: The Last Stand and the next X-Men movie (which is teased 1/2 way through the end credits).  I probably won't watch this one again, as it just didn't do it for me.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|I have been in the Military for awhile, and got tired of my issued rig because I could never get it to fit right and it had a bunch of unecassary material on it. I am a firm believer in carrying only what you really need to get the job done, especially when you are on your feet for hours on end. I was surprised to see such great quality in the Condor rig. Sewing is good and the material is strong. The only down fall is the sewn in pouches. I personally like the location of the pouches, so I have no issues with them being sewn in, but others might. Absolutely a great product for the price.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I've been a Yahoo mail user for 8 years.  For pleasure and work.<br /><br />Works very well 95% of the time.  But the rest of the time it crashes or asks me to try again later.  30 minutes without email for work can be a real problem.  I might make a move to gmail -I'm simply addicted to Yahoo as my homepage.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Fun and challenging. Darn gopher...gotta watch that guy! You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this game.  Very highly recommend!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|How about less than 24 hour service???? I love, love, love, the customer service and the analysis/diagnosis was exactly what I needed for my Kindle.Thanks to Kindle  customer service for repairing my Kindle Fire micro USB cable!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book came highly recommended and it did not disappoint! The book can be very sad at times but it is definitely worth the read!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Really like this game, it isnt as easy as some but if ur good u will b done quick. Iloved that the voices actually played &amp; not just have to read it, that made it better for my daughter to play also.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|But still good.  Need to listen to it a few more times to get the full effect.  Love her other CDs.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Edit 9/4/13:  The developer read this review and fixed it.  I tried all I could to make the Maybes go away and they stay.  What else could you ask for?<br /><br />If you exit and come back and resume a game, all the \\"maybes\\" are wiped off the board.  That's kind of a dealbreaker for a game like this.  Both because the Maybes are needed in harder puzzles and because this kind of game tends to be a pickup and put down game.  If that's fixed then this is a great implementation.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Ok, I'll preface this: I don't like Wes Anderson. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure he's a fantastic person. It's just his movies. I just don't like them. But I like this one. It's so much fun, and silly and Wes Anderson's style seems particularly well suited for stop animation. Everything that I didn't think worked in his other films seems to work here.<br /><br />Maybe I do like Wes Anderson and just don't like the people in his films. This one had foxes.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This one's a winner. It's a great brain challenge game, especially when you start getting into the higher levels. I think this one can keep my attention for a while.
B00406O7YK|5.0|I LOVE Hello Dolly! The way the dancers move toward the camera really draws you into the production. The musical numbers are fantastic and the actors are right on their mark. I adore all Barbra Streisand's work and this is my favorite musical of hers. I would fully recommend.
B001MTENOC|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot. I especially found the early chapters to be educational. Some of the book was a little toagical for me but it ended well.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I love this show, super great actors, story lines are interesting.  The only problem with this season was when Bond came to the firm and abruptly left.  The story line felt rushed and not told very well.  Other than that I plan to watch all the other seasons.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Always have loved uno as a child and now I see I still do as an adult too:):):) Love it!!!
B001CDWFPC|2.0|I believe there is a problem with the download.  I cannot access the books of the Bible as needed, only able to read the introductory portion of the ESV.  Hoping for a solution to the problem.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I've lost so much sleep because of this series. I keep on watching one more episode! Just one more episode turns into 3 more episodes! Haven't turned on regular TV since I downloaded the series. Very violent, but the characters are great.
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|A good disk with good tunes that showcase Via's mastery of the guitar, but didn't have the hummable ear-worm that other disks offer.  None of the &#34;funny&#34; songs that mark other disks, either.<br /><br />Overall, good but not great.
B0061S0A64|3.0|Just didn't get into it much, it is interesting and I may try it out more later but for now &#34;it's okay&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby Season 3 is great! Anyone who watches even one episode is hooked. Thanks Amazon for making this available.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Well what can I say other than it works, I have not had any crashes but then again I don't use it a lot.
0307593525|5.0|I love these books! They are a beautiful addition to my kitchen. They aren't just recipe books like other books...they go into great detail about just HOW to do things. Whether you are a beginner or pro, these books are fabulous. They are also great reading.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Great for timing different stuff. My biggest use is cooking, works great when you have multiple things going that require timing. I have not had a crash so far but I have not put it through MAJOR paces either. I think the most I have had is 3 or 4 going at same time. It would be nice if you could set specific sounds to different ones though not necessary just be nice.
B007SGM084|3.0|I probably would have liked this book a lot more when I was in my 20's. I think the point could have been made just as well without being so graphic. Plus, I couldn't talk with a lot of people about it. :-)
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Fun to play and a great time killer. I just use this when I have to wait for something or I just have nothing to do. Kills time well.
B008M721MS|2.0|I have been helping people with Skype for Kindle tablets and they have been having quirky problems. We have to delete the app and redownload it every time we want to use it. It opens but does NOT recognize itself as being online. All contacts remain dulled out and when called from another tablet or pc, shows the Kindle owner as offline. If Skype doesn't fix this, they should stop providing it for the KINDLE!! The one on my iPad works everytime--so Skype needs some Amazon help!!!
B00004XPPE|5.0|There is something about this movie. Grab hold of your suspense of disbelief, go back in time and look at the United States during the Cold War in an Alternate Timeline. Henry Fonda is a believable President, Larry Hagman is a believable Russian translator and even later to be comic Dom Deluise is believable as an airman.  This movie is not high tech (the shots of planes were filmed secretly because the military would not let the producers near its film archives) but it will have you on the edge of your seat. The surprise ending could have happened but for the fact we never suffered a complete computer mishap.
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|Peter Jackson's \\"Kong\\" was not just a movie but a thrill ride. A hyper thrill ride that touched me in so many areas. Especially visually. As a artist I almost quit painting after llooking at the astonishing hyper realistic detail in the movie. The texture, color, detail was incredible. The narrative was just as powerful as the visual.  Kong's battle with the two T-Rex was the best special effects I have ever seen. The intricate attention to detail as they fell down the cliff was uncanny. I found myself cheering for a alpha male like myself. Kong transcened his beastiality. Any XY chromosome male could identify with his sheer power, masculinity and battle scars..I rooted for Kong as if I had a front row seat at a Mike Tyson fight. I think Kong is one of the most iconic creature in moviedom history.  I almost quit painting after gazing at the color, texture, and detail of Jackon's epic movie. The only flaw was the depiction of the natives they came off as caricatures-----without any humanity.The other flaw was when  the ship started its epic voyage the smoke from the steamer looks pasted on the sky-- no movement.  In closing Peter Jackson's Kong is a classic why not a sequel or prequel?
B00005R2IS|5.0|It is so cool to hear Mel Gibson speak in his Australian accent (which he has now lost) using Australian slang. The whole cast was dubbed over (including Gibson) for the American release. Some of the Australian slang is dirty so censors in the U.S. covered it up with American words. But come on, who in the United States would would have understood Australian slang in 1980. The extras are great, especially if you like detail. However, it's stuff you have to read - about distopian societies in Science Fiction and such.
B009RX85N0|3.0|I'm actually surprised reviews are open, seeing as the DVD doesn't officially come out til next week.<br />I am not a HUGE fan of s2 as a whole the magic is gone(the magic for the fans-pertaining to season 1), the plots are predictable,its just not that great. To be honest, I'm looking extremely looking forward to Wonderland(the spin off) and given the option wouldn't give the s3 trailers more than one glance.Ariel and all.<br /><br />~EPISODE SPOILERS AHEAD~<br />2x01 Broken: The curse is broken. It begins with what is in my opinion a poor copy off of the Snowing scene from 1x01 featuring Aurora(who i have grown to hate with a passion) and Phillip.There is the mystery man in New York scene-at the time it was all who is he??Why is he relevant??? We would later find out.The Charmings unite. The entire force of good SB characters go to knock down Rumple's door.Demanding why are we still here?? That is after trying to mob Regina.Meanwhile Rumple has a plan-aqgainst Belle's wishes,of course-to get revenge on Regina. Oh and BTW I'm pretty sure Mulan and Phillip were together-and in no hurry to rescue aurora when Cora froze time.<br /><br />2x02 We are Both:In FTL, Regina is trying to escape the life her mother is trying to force her into-ie marrying the king. She eventually is stopped by both Rumple and mom-at separate times. And hurls mommy dearest Cora into a mirror and straight into,surprise,surprise,Wonderland. Meanwhile in SB, Regina is trying to keep Henry from leaving her whilst everyone else is trying to figure out how to leave.Charming makes a stirring speech in the nature of the title,Regina eventually forks Henry over to Charming for safe keeping. Meanwhile, in the modern FTL Snow and Emma are being held captive by Mulan and Aurora.<br /><br />2x03 The Lady of the Lake: The Lancelot episode.In modern FTL, Snow and Emma find themselves imprisoned with none other than Cora. In FTL, Snow, Charming, Red, and the good guys rally against a new enemy who turns out tobe...Lancelot. Snow is then taken to king George and given a potion to ensure she never can have a child. With the help of Aurora,Mulan, and Lancelot*cough*CORA*Cough*,Snow and Emma try to return home...to no avail-in order to win against Cora, Emma kinda had to torch their ride home.<br /><br />2x04 The Crocodile:AKA Rumplestiltskin(you can argue about my spelling of it later).In FTL, we discover the loss of Rumple's wife,Milah, to a love affair with a pirate,Captain Hook. IN SB, Belle is kidnapped and essentially pushed through a mine shaft by her father to make her forget her love for Rumple. The Ruby/Belle friendship is introduced in this ep.<br /><br />2x05 The Doctor:Dr Whale's identity is revealed. Jefferson convinces him to fake not being able to help Regina bring her love back to life. In SB, he succeeds only in the end to have Regina lose him again.I'm no evil Regal but that scene did move me.<br /><br />2x06 Tallahassee:Emma Swan's love story revealed. She meets a guy.She thieves with a guy. She falls in love with a guy.Pinocchio approaches guy. Emma ends up in jail and pregnant with Henry. In modern times, she's trying to steal a compass from a giant with Hook's aid.<br /><br />2x07 Child of the Moon: In FTL, Red encounters her mother who tells her she must embrace her inner wolf. In the end she kills her mom to protect Snow.In SB, Mass killings are happening and Ruby is convinced she is to blame. She is..but its not entirely her fault king George has put more than his fair share of this into play. Eventually, destroying the only object retrieved-from Jefferson-that could bring Snow and Emma back.<br /><br />2x08 Into the deep: Regina and Rumple use Charming. Snow and Emma must keep compass from Cora and Hook. and ooh zombies.Forgettable episode.<br /><br />2x09 The Queen of Hearts: Winter finale. Regina and Rumple try to find a way to keep Cora from coming through a portal to SB. Snow and Emma after a complete pity party on Emma's part and with the help of Mulan and Aurora return home. Meanwhile, in FTL Regina enlists Hook to kill her mother. Which after meeting her, they both agree to a fake out. Then Cora freezes time in her part of the fairytale world to protect it from the curse.<br /><br />2x10 The Cricket game: A weak return, in my opinion. Regina wants to be accepted. Cora wants to alienate Regina. Archie is kidnapped.<br /><br />2x11 The  Outsider: Rumple seeks revenge on Hook. An outsider arrives in town-actually running over Hook in the process. Belle is forced outside the town line. In FTL, Belle must defeat a beast. Which actually she ends up working with Mulan and rescuing Phillip.<br /><br />2x12 In the name of the brother: The only noteworthy part of this episode,Frankenwolf. We met and loved Rumbelle in 1x12 and now this. Otherwise, what do we do with the outsider???Do you remember me?? Hi mom. Frankenstein creates his brother the monster.<br /><br />2x13 Tiny: The story of the giant/Jack(and James) and the beanstalk.Another forgettable episode actually 2x14 and 2x15 are no better by these standards.<br /><br />2x14 Manhattan: Rumple enlists Emma's help in finding his son. It was no shock to approx 90% of viewers. We knew Neal=Bae since 2x06. Henry meets his father. In FTL, Bae tries to convince Rumple to come with him to a world without magic.<br /><br />2x15 The Queen is dead:We meet Snow's mother who them dies thanks to a petty axe to grind with Cora. In SB, Snow refuses to celebrate her birthday. Choosing to mourn her mom instead. Snow's nursemaid is killed by Regina and Cora.<br /><br />2x16 The Miller's daughter: Rose McGowan guest stars as a younger Cora. The first consequential-in my opinion-episode since 2x11.Cora is challenged to turn gold into straw by her king. Rumple teaches her magic. They fall in love.Cora removes her own heart in order to gain power. She marries the king and has Regina. A battle occurs in SB. Snow tricks Regina into killing her own mother.<br /><br />2x17 Welcome to storybrooke: My most hated episode of the season. A)the curse is annoying-seeing how it worked, I'm surprised Regina is not bowing to Emma in thanks.B) Owen=Greg. Capital DUH. C)Waste of Sheriff Graham. When this episode wasn't boring me to tears-it was causing me to laugh at the ludicrous nature of things..at times when I'm pretty sure laughter was not wanted.Snow pissed me off with her moping. I mean HELLOOOOO,EARTH TO SNOW!!!She was going to kill your ENTIRE family.<br /><br />2x18 Selfless,Brave, and True: August ep. He realizes he's turning back to wood and tries to stop it. Snow comes out of moping to practice her archery a la princess fiona. Runs into August.Slaps Gepetto. August tries to warn Emma about Tamara and her magical taser of doom(LAAAAAAAAAME). Hot august is turned back into awkward looking Pinocchio,WTF.<br /><br />2x19 Lacey: In SB, Regina implants Belle with false memories. Turning her into Lacey a slutty,non-informed,bar hopper.Well, Rumple needs to get her to fall back in love with him. In FTL, Rumple captures Robin Hood(I may not give a horses tail about s3 but it does piss me off that they're recasting him),Belle releases him. Belle convinces Rumple not to kill him and Rumple lets Robin and a pregnant maid Marian get away.<br /><br />2x20 The Evil Queen: IN SB, Regina and Hook formulate a plan to get her and Henry back to FTL.In FTL(past), Regina enlists Rumple's help in making her unrecognizable to her people. It backfires and Snow saves her. That plan eventually backfires when upon seeing a field of dead people.Yeah,oops. you're the one who said \\"Kill them all\\". She gives up her identity to Snow and ends up crawling back to rumple with her tail between her legs.<br />\\"The Queen is dead. Long live the evil queen.\\"~Regina<br /><br />2x21 The Second star to the right:After finding the bean field destroyed the Charmings seek out Regina who was kidnapped by Tamara and Greg and tortured. Meanwhile, Bae finds himself in 19th century London where he meets the Darling family.And Eventually is kidnapped by the wraith Peter Pan's shadow and rescued by Captain Hook.<br /><br />2x22 And Straight on til Morning: Greg and Tamara attempt to destroy storybrooke.The town turns back into the forest it once was. Regina keeps the fail safe from working at its full power. In the end it takes both Emma and Regina to save everyone.In Neverland, Bae is kidnapped by the lost boys.Henry is kidnapped by Tamara and Greg and transported to Neverland. Neal falls through a portal and Emma presumes him dead but really he's saved by Aurora,Mulan, and Phillip.Rumple,Snow,Charming,Emma,Hook, and Regina journey to Neverland to save Henry.<br /><br />One last complaint, dear writers leave the initiative type storylines to \\"Revenge\\" please. The fans don't think it has any place here.<br /><br />~The Bonus Feautures~<br />Sincerely Hook: I'm not a hook head like some others therefore I don't really care what Colin O'Donoghue has to say about playing Hook.<br />Girl Power:This one I like. If I get(or rent the discs) it'll be for this how women have grown so much since these fairytales were first written and how the writers brought more power to our favorite ladies.all of them.<br />The Family Tree thing: Talking about the effed up family tree again. Yeah,we know already.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It was fun to play...wish it had more levels and maybe clues if you get stuck. Helps with your memory too..
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the coolest game on a tablet. It is where you have to build things by mining stuff. If you have heard of minecraft and wanted to try it, it this is the cheapest one as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is amazing. But I was just sometimes there is a button where you can switch from the world tour part to just the regular Subway Surfers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is where you have to get away from the train cop. You have to go through a train yard and get as many points as you can, but, don't hit anything or you are done. I would recommend it to anyone!
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This story is very good for the soul.  It is just as good each time I read it.  BEST of all in French.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|An action story with a believable and well acted plot. This is a story of determination and perseverance.  Leaves the viewer with the feeling of reward for the man who never gives up.  Has an inspirational aspect.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I went to the theatre to see Red 2 but never saw the first. I truly enjoyed the movie, but liked the sequel better. Watching the original gave me history on the characters in Red 2
B00637D114|5.0|Simple and funny. Also I used to watch this cartoon as a kid so it was pleasant that they kept to the story format of the old cartoons. I enjoyed. Although it is unmistakably targeted to children I still very much enjoyed it.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|I have seen this movie countless number of times and I find something new in it each time I view it.  A slew of great quotes have come out of this movie: &#34;Play it Sam, Play it for me&#34; (Ingrid Bergman); &#34;Of all the saloons in all the world, she has to walk into mine&#34; (Bogart); &#34;We'll always have Paris&#34; (Bogart); and so on.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|You should watch it. very simple, not too long and beautifully written. It may be the first zombie-human love story.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Completely lives up to its reputation. Entrancing and embracing. Characters are beautifully designed to conjure u<br />a bit of something in US all
B006TLZIII|5.0|Always love to watch this movie! It's a classic...a must watch...if you love scarface then you will love this. Shottas is one of my fav and a must have in every collection. Bless up
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I started with their other app on my iPod called \\"Simply Being\\" as an aid to 6 weeks of anxiety. It helped a lot, but then I left it for awhile because I kept associating the tape with the anxiety. A year later I started this app along with the Simply Being and I prefer this one, as it really is a guided meditation and relaxation. The other is meditative but doesn't take you through the sequence of body part focus and relaxation. I prefer the music as an accompaniment rather than the nature sounds and find the sliding bar which adjusts the voice and music volume in relation to each other is very helpful. Now, I use both as part of my bedtime routine to shut my mind off and most nights it works like a charm to ease into sleep.  If I wake up in the night, I set it up again (sometimes the shorter version) and zzzzz again.  The ipod ear plug also helps!<br />I really like the woman's voice on the app. Have heard some other meditation tapes and they always seem to be read by male voices with British accents, which for some reason I found disconcerting. This voice is very soothing.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|my wife cheates on me with a midget cop, i know because when my wife comes home i check her purse for little lollipop gulid pops. -_-
B00632HWOG|2.0|Love the app EXCEPT for the fact that I spend half my time deleting the same emails over and over! I started &quot;starring&quot; email so I could tell quickly if I already read it. Too many times emails come back that I just deleted. Very frustrating!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game really entertaining fun to play with friends hi Apple Bob from ooh and DVD high high high back
B001AACEP8|5.0|Liked this earlier album. Very satisfying tone, love hot n cold. Cute video like a movie. Her voice isn't in the same category as some singers but very expressive personality when singing on vid. Centers listener as if it's spoken lyrics, nearly is for most.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I started playing this game and have to make myself put it down.  Wishing the playing the game was free instead of costing those gold tokens.  Still though worth the buy.
B007JOM7C4|5.0|I liked it ~<br />Got Katy Perry after watching her bio filmed by MTV and then youtube vevo videos. Her personality really makes the music, and the storytelling is very satisfying for this summery album.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game but the only thing is you cannot change the look of the tiles.  There are however challenges and different difficulty levels.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It touched my heart and hope that many more people read this book.  This Doctor is to be commended for his courage to write this book.
B004UPANAI|5.0|I really love this movie a lot huge fan of xmen and can't wait to rematch all of them again
B006TJXZ30|3.0|I can't figure out why the changes i make to my account on my pc don't show up on kindle.  for instance i delete unwanted mail on my pc but it still shows up on my kindle.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Who killed Laura Palmer? That was a the popular question in the 90's on this tv series. It is very entertaining in a campy, weird, soap opera kind of way. Love Special Agent Cooper!
B0094K1WZE|2.0|This movie never really grabbed our family's attention, even though the stunt work was very polished.  Sort of a typical MI movie.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|a bit smaller, than i expected, but anyway, easy to work with and good quality. wish it was a bit larger though
B005F2BBLK|3.0|Our family watched this movie, and both kids stated at the end of the movie, &#34;It's weird.&#34;  Overall, it was an okay movie, and if you want to watch it, feel free.  Would I highly recommend this movie? No.  But it's an okay way to spend an afternoon indoors during a rainstorm.
B00BYISRC0|4.0|I like this album; it's poppier than the amazing 'high violet', but the songs seem to be much of the same, again and again. I like it, but doesn't compare to their last one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun challenging game that lets you challenge yourself but not to the point of frustration. Right when I think I can't figure it out bam I get it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app there is never a whole week I don't go on at least five times LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I'm probably biased because I'm in law school, and a lot of stuff in the series is not very realistic, but it's still worth your time for sure.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|really enjoyed these with the viewing of his story on 60 minutes and the documentary movie that won an Oscar!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is by far the best hidden object type game that I have encountered on Android. A combination of multiple types of mini games makes this app very enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing! Made me want to read the second book immediately. The suspense of wondering what happens. It was an incredible book.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|This SlimPort SP1002 adapter works with the new Nexus 7 (2013). It is as simple as plugging the device in.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill is a household name for any country music fan, but not so much for Paul Franklin. Most fans don't realize that a great deal of the time when you hear superb (pedal) steel guitar licks on a recording, it's probably Paul Franklin making beautiful, soulful, music - and not just country. He's played with the likes of Mark Knopfler, and many more, and with this wonderful album/CD you'll see why. All of the cuts are so musically wonderful, you'll be playing it over & over.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I thought this book was interesting. I saw the twist coming, but not exactly the way it turned out!! Makes me want a sequel.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I watched the first 3 seasons of Glee on Netflix over the summer and was instantly hooked. I tried to find season 4 online, but failed and it was expensive everywhere else so I came on here and found it! The entire season is only $29.99 whereas if you purchase each episode individually it will be around $45, so I would definitely recommend buying the whole season. I think season 4 is one of the best seasons yet!
0553593714|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book but honestly it was very cumbersome. Do NOT get the Mass Paperback it really is a pain and shouldn't be read in such a small form and terrible flimsy paper.<br /><br />I suggest going for a hardcover to get a better experience.
0817439390|5.0|This book is a must for photography library's<br />It explains in lay terms that you will understand<br />The examples are easy to perform
0767903854|4.0|I always enjoy Bill Bryson's sense of humor.  This book is more serious than many of his, but I learned about Australia's history and geography and wish I could have been there myself.  It was a good purchase.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Good savory, southern movie. Similar to the southern genre of Fried Green Tomatoes, Sling Blade or Bernie. Had not heard of it before we streamed it. Glad we decided to watch it.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  Can't get enough of it and love the extra's that are added to the package.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As I wipe the tears still I have to admit this book moved me. I am a teacher for students with special needs & work with all students on how to defend each other from the unkind people out there. Once again, the irony of where this unkindness stems is that probably the adults are ones who need to be taught. I love how this book chronicles different perspectives with my favorite, a 5th grade boy who wants to blend in.  Excellent writing with powerful messages for ALL ages. This book made me ready to start school again, refreshed again that the human spirit of kindness does matter.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|Thanks so much for Amazon having all the seasons available online...I am on season 5 now and wishing there would be more...
B00CO8TBR4|5.0|I have been using the i5-4670 for about two months, and I haven't experienced any problems or BSOD. I also ran Prime95 for 24 hours and there were no errors.<br /><br />I am not using the stock Intel heat sink, instead I am using the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus with a new Noctua NF-P12 fan. On idle the average temperature for each core is about 30 degrees Celsius. On full burn the temperature increases to about 65 degrees Celsius. I upgraded from an Intel Core 2 Duo E6550 and now my room doesn't get as hot as before.<br /><br />I also got a new motherboard and memory. The performance is amazing compared to hardware from three generations back.
B0091UAEA6|5.0|A very accurate look into the lives of our nations special operators. I get goosebumps just thinking about this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is what I have been looking for. it has so many games that you cant ever get board with it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I loved the way it followed the books and I really liked their choice of actors. I think it was very well done. I particularly thought the  actor portraying the dwarf was excellent. Would give it at least a PG13 or R rating because of the explicit sex (although done tastefully) in the series.
B000FZETIO|5.0|Sorry the filmed version of Everything's Duckie Edition (apparently) no longer exists, glad they got footage of the actors speaking about it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I loved the way it followed the books and I really liked their choice of actors. I think it was very well done. I particularly thought the  actor portraying the dwarf was excellent. Would give it at least a PG13 or R rating because of the explicit sex (although done tastefully) in the series.
B00005RDAF|1.0|There is a Pepsi ad, an ad for her concert in Las Vegas (like 30 secs long), a performance of hers on MTV awards, two music videos, and that's about it! It's amazing that they are selling this as if it has a ton of her videos on it. Wow! What a misleading name for this DVD! Don't waste your money!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game! The graphics and theme are very good! I played the previous version and I like this one even more!
6305718954|5.0|Great movie, one of the greatest horror type movies i have ever seen, i am obsess not only with what the movie is about but by the great performance by my favorite actress Patricia Arquette.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Playing it on repeat; catchy and interesting mix of beats, vocals, and instruments. Quality music for a low price: yes please!
0425269205|5.0|I am a big fan of the series and i felt it was appropriate to add this to my collection. I love the way the book looks i wish it would have more pictures within the book but either way it's great. I love the cover the decoration the binder the book is in and the signature by the author. Great book to have if you are a fan and are a book collector.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|My daughter likes this app - it has kept her busy! She is 7 and I'd say it's perfect for her age group.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|this book was really good for me after going trough a tough time, all the experiments work more than i had imagined specially the first one, you get a lot of surprises and its worth it
B00136Q342|5.0|This album is Johnny Cash at his finest. All the early classics are here and performed by one of the greatest singers of american music ever.
0812550706|5.0|I enjoyed Ender's Game, especially given some of the technology (iPad, the Internet in general) that it imagined long before those were real things.  Fun action, quick moving, worth the read.
089381525X|5.0|A must have book for anyone interested in 'real' photography of the 'real' world, especially aspiring photojournalists. Salgado is one of a kind.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Its a good mix of scifi and romance without the romance being too overpowering. The main character is a bit of a pompous ass but it works for him and the supporting cast is pretty decent.
3836538725|5.0|Arguably the greatest photojournalist of all time. Genesis is a showcase for his great eye, his ability to work intimately with his subjects in the most remote, challenging and dangerous environs. A true testament to a rapidly disappearing (and extremely important) genre of photography, IMHO.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|What can I say... I'm addicted...can't put it down!!  My cat is mad at me for ignoring her!!  I love it.
B00007KQA3|3.0|First of all, I must say that the LOOK and ATMOSPHERE of this movie is very UN-\\"80s\\"...the movie looks like it was made in the \\"40's\\"....yes, I understand the BOOK was written in the \\"40s\\", but maybe someone should make an UPDATED version of the movie...might be a thought.<br /><br />Second of all, the movie is weird, dismal, dreary....no attractive people to look at, fair warning...and a bit CONFUSING to watch!  That was the FIRST time I watched it.  By the second viewing, I had started putting things together and the movie made more sense. So be patient...if you are a bit confused by things after your initial viewing, give the movie another chance.  Things will click.  As for the dark dreary atmosphere?  Well, I guess that's the look they were going for!<br /><br />The message of the movie is disturbing.  You realize just how awful it would be to live in a country where your every move is determined by \\"Big Brother\\" (i.e., the government).  You also realize that the government has the ability to lie to you and brainwash you.  You can't even have your own thoughts, or you will be accused of \\"thought crime!\\"  No individuality; no difference of opinion...no personal life, even (because that takes time away from your support of \\"the government\\" and love of \\"big brother\\")...and horror of horrors, you can' even enjoy sex!<br /><br />Yes, speaking of which, there is plenty of odd nudity in this movie....you have been warned!  Full frontal (and \\"backal\\") nudity of a young girl....(yes, something else that is disturbing...the main guy in the movie, although supposedly in his thirties, appears to be in his late forties or fifties, whereas his love interest appears to be 17 -18...again...you have been warned)!<br /><br />The love story is a priority in the plot....<br /><br />All in all, I feel this is a movie worth seeing due to the important message of what can happen if big government is allowed to take over every aspect of our lives...a world is created that you would never EVER want to be a part of......however, this is no upbeat la-di-da type flick...and do NOT view with young children!ver EVER want to be a part of......however, this is no upbeat la-di-da type flick...and do NOT view with young children!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|This movie is really great for what it is meant to be, G.I. Joe Retaliation! So many people put a bad reviews because they don't like this kind of movie, not because of the movie itself. It's like complaining about a particular meal in the restaurant because we just don't like the particular style, not because of the food quality itself.<br /><br />It's a G.I. Joe movie with Dwayne Johnson, Bruce Willis, etc. C'mon! What do you expect? This movie is awesome as it is meant to be. A much better G.I. Joe movie than the previous one by far for sure. Better story, better action, better jokes, and way better actors and actresses. If you like G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra, you will love this even better! If you don't like the first G.I. Joe movie, this is still a solid action movie.<br /><br />Go watch this movie, it's awesome as it was meant to be. Don't trust people who critic a movie just because they don't like this kind of movie, not because of the movie itself. It's just not relevant.<br /><br />G.I. Joe: Retaliation is awesome!<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|This is a well written mystery with many twists and turns.  I am looking forward to reading more of his books.
0064471837|5.0|Do you like magic? Good against evil? A female heroine? Mysteries? Zombie-like creatures?<br /><br />If you said, \\"Yes\\" to all of the above, this book is your cup of tea!<br /><br />I dare you to read the first chapter - I guarantee that after only one chapter, you will see just how brilliant of a writer Garth Nix is.<br /><br />Happy reading! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|ABSOLUTELY outstanding. This book is awesome... I feel like I know these characters personally. It is very well written. The email exchange brings a funny edge to the writing and to the reading experience.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Enjoyed it on my iTouch when it first came out. Loving it again on my Kindle Fire HD! Thanks guys!
B00EE3KMOI|4.0|I was fortunate to see all of this ITV broadcast series (8 episodes) not long ago...<br />David Tennent is brilliant as usual and I'm strongly hoping he'll be back for Series 2 as they're making another Series for ITV which is testimate to how good it was as it was originally devised as a one-off. The Fox Broadcasting Network announced that they would produce a remake of Broadchurch for US audiences to air in the 2014-15 season but I wouldn't expect it will be quite as good and rich with character as this one.<br />The town of Clevedon just outside Bristol is the fictional town of Broadchurch with a murder of a young boy at the beach (West Bay in Dorset)as the setting... Like all good detective stories, there are plenty of suspects and the series leads you from one to another as the series goes on. Olivia Colman (Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller)and Tennent(Detective Inspector Alec Hardy) play the investigating Detectives at odds over the case... Having mostly Seen Olivia in comedic roles such as Peep Show, The Green Wing and That Mitchell and Webb Look among other parts, I was very pleased to see her skills in a serious dramatic role. Tennent is very deep and brooding in his character with issues that come out over the course of time. I won't delve into any details of the plot.<br />Watch it!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Movie plays fine, no quality issues. Four year old loved it and it brought back some old game playing days.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|Downloaded the GMAIL CLIENT.... but will not let me go on to the next step.... so I am not too impressed... probably will uninstall it since  nothing has happened,
B000002HMH|3.0|Though the early 90s were a period where grunge replaced heavy metal as the hard-rockin' genre, Metallica's popularity persevered well into the 90s as the premier metal band on the planet (not just the United States, mind you, but planet Earth!)  After touring to support the immense popularity of their [[ASIN:B000002H97 self-titled release]], the band went back to the drawing board and started to record their follow up, Load.  Though metal fans waited with bated breath for the latest release, they were a little dismayed (to say the least) when Metallica came back with short hair, guyliner, Lars rocking a single bass drum, a new sense of fashion that made them look \\"sophisticated\\", and an entirely new sound that replaced their thrash beats and metal riffs with a radio-friendly hard rock sound.  The end result was a record that sold very well and provided some fantastic radio singles, but also disillusioned the hardcore Metallica metalheads to the point where many stopped considering them as a metal band.<br /><br />Make no mistake, if this album were released by any other hard rock group, it would be considered successful beyond a shadow of a doubt.  The album went platinum five times and released several singles that either garnered significant video play (back when MTV actually played videos, you'd be hard-pressed not to see \\"Hero of the Day\\" or \\"Until It Sleeps\\" as part of their regular rotation) or generated significant radio play (King Nothing, Bleeding Me, and Ain't My Bitch were in regular rotation on rock stations.)  Yet as far as Metallica's legacy was concerned, this was the last studio album that would sell north of 5 million copies and proved to be the album that led to a decline in their popularity (keep in mind, though, that even in \\"decline\\", their new albums still sell around 2 million copies in the U.S. alone.)  Though the Napster suit didn't help, more fans began to justify their Metallica fandom by saying they liked everything before the Black Album, which had a trickle-down effect by either discouraging established metal fans from supporting Metallica or discouraging new fans of the genre from checking them out because they weren't \\"metal\\" any longer (conversely, Slayer saw a career renaissance for remaining \\"tr00 to metal\\" throughout the years.)<br /><br />So who all will like this album will depend on what their stylistic preferences are.  If you're the type of person who enjoys rockin' out to the tunes that you hear on radio stations that play hard rock, you're probably going to be familiar with some of the tracks on the CD and will throw the horns up when they start playing away.  Yet if you're someone who's hoping to hear something that thrashes like \\"Trapped Under Ice\\", \\"Battery\\", or \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\", you're going to be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of hard rock and mainstream rock.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I felt as if I could hear the author on each word!  I am now ready to apply this to my life!
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Cruise is building up some good SF movies in his repertoire. Great special effects, a reasonable plot, and slightly corny romance. Overall enjoyable entertainment.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|My book club enjoyed reading this hard to put down book.  It inspired many topic of discussion.  As an added bonus, our group enjoyed trying the recipe in the book too!
B0011MZOEI|3.0|if you like bruce willis in all his incarnations, this is okay.  lots of action but a bit ho-hum -- not his best
B002SM2QDC|3.0|It was good.  Some nice effects.  The kids liked it.  I'm glad I didn't go to the movies for it but it was nice to see overall.
030789701X|5.0|It is an awesome book, if you have a question, this book will awnser it, I have never seen so much knowledge in one book about a game, there is everything you would ever need to do whatever you want to do in Skyrim, 1000 times over. Amazing. Truly amazing what people can do when they take their time and are super, super detailed. I love it. Please if you are a fan, patronize these people, buy the guide and have even more fun than you already had with this amazing game.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|Most of my experience watching SciFi channel has been watching Bad movies. Calling most of the SciFi movies are much worse than B grade movies, but to my great surprise I stumbled over this series and loved it from the very start. All the characters are entertaining, well developed, good acting and even though I would not give all story lines an excellent rating, overall this has fast become one of my favorite programs I have ever watched. Also it doesn't hurt that it is filmed in one of my favorite places in the world.
0312323867|5.0|I read this book in 3 days. I had  a lot of time to kill and it was such a cute book. If you love romance and drama with a happy ending definitely a recommend.
B000MXJ7LS|5.0|Well I can't rate it right now because I don't have it yet guys. But I can give it 5 stars because I love the movie.
B000I9U8VO|5.0|I loved the first X-Men and then the second was just as good. I love Hugh Jackman and I just LOVE the Wolverine character.

B0079J28NC|4.0|Great DVD with clear pictures and sounds.  We enjoyed the music and a full feature movie of the Yellow Submarine.  In addition we liked the extra pictures of the Beatles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hi, I'm Jessica.<br />In my opinion TEMPLE RUN 2 is a great game for kids &amp; adults.<br />I'm literally addicted to this game.<br />It's really fun and challenging.<br />And the best part, it's FREE!
B00C3JU7D6|5.0|This is the coolest thing that Fall Out Boy has ever done. They have created a vinyl record for the people like myself who need this in their collection. Also, the vinyl record is see through red. It's amazing and a must for any rock & roll fan. Save Rock And Roll!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead never disappoints! It had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Highly recommend it!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Living as an actor in LA I feel very blessed to have many ties to the show..I've met many of the cast members, attempted to get auditions for the show via my agent and head shot drops AND my 1st acting teacher in LA was Jeff Kober/Jacob Hale !<br />Anyhow, this season shows major dissension in the club, the past comes back to haunt the club via letters from John Teller..To say more would give away too many spoilers..>As this show came from the ashes of the Shield and Deadwood it's great to see more actors from both shows step into the mire..>The Shield was the greatest show on TV from 2002 to 2008...SOA picks up that mantle as the greatest on TV--maybe the greatest tv show ever other than The Shield and Band of Brothers.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Cute, but over-rated.  Glad I rented instead of going to the theatre.  Acting is good...script, or maybe director... not so much.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|What more could you ask for?  Great actors.  Funny plot.  An onça.  It's a cliché, but they just don't make them like this nowadays.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Much like Billy Joel's \\"Last Play At Shea\\" fans have awaited this release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  After watching only one thought comes to mind:  it was worth the wait.  In the seemingly wasteland of music circa 2013 there are no successors to the utterly otherworldly music of the sixties and seventies.  Sure, my daughter who is still in her twenties thinks Kayne West is cool, but his \\"music\\" will sorely be forgotten withing a couple of years.  This stuff lives on. But, there's a reason - this music is some of the best ever recorded and performed.  And performed it is here.<br /><br />If there are any doubters as to the sheer power and impact, let alone validity, of Led Zeppelin this concert should put it to rest.  This is utterly more than 3/4ths of Led Zeppelin as it is as if the band is resurrected in full glory.  Jason Bonham fills his dad's shoes gloriously and the other members certainly speak for themself.  This is as good as any concert the Zep have ever performed in their career and that is proof positive of the power of their music.  In fact in the musical climate of 2013 this stands out more than I wish it would.  Simply put there isn't a single band who has managed to construct such a compelling musical catalog in the rock genre.<br /><br />As for this performance, it's superlative.  If Plant has lost a bit of range he's picked up on so much more musical nuance thant the performance rises to a real level of excellence that just can't be denied.  Page is a mode of hitting all the right licks, John Paul underpins every thing with a bottom-end that Entwistle would rubber-stamp, and then there's Plant...Well, Plant is in a rare category of uber-frontman terrirory that only he and Jagger can inhabit.  It's clear here on this perfectly shot Blu-Ray disc.<br /><br />I was one of those who questioned after such glorious reviews why this concert wasn't release to fans.  I imagine I posted on several boards as to the injustice of clamoring fans being denied.  All is forgiven I must say as this release is uniformly excellent in both sight and sound.  It would'nt matter if the material wasn't top-shelf, it is and it is hard to fault, if a bit late.<br /><br />If you're a fan this is a no-brainer.  If you're not yet then hold-on because you are about to be converted.  I must say that I imensely enjoy Plant's latter day musical journeys with his Americana leanings, some re-interpreting Led Zeppelin's catalog to great effect, yet there is no substitute for the original and that is just what you get here.  Just think of Jason Bonham as his father, it's not hard when you really listen, and what you have here is a latter day Led Zeppelin that aged like fine wine.  Buy it, look and listen, you'll be transported to musical nirvana when rock music was excellent and mattered.iven I must say as this release is uniformly excellent in both sight and sound.  It would'nt matter if the material wasn't top-shelf, it is and it is hard to fault, if a bit late.<br /><br />If you're a fan this is a no-brainer.  If you're not yet then hold-on because you are about to be converted.  I must say that I imensely enjoy Plant's latter day musical journeys with his Americana leanings, some re-interpreting Led Zeppelin's catalog to great effect, yet there is no substitute for the original and that is just what you get here.

B009AMAJPA|4.0|This movie was very enjoyable after a somewhat &#34;slow&#34; start. Then it really gets going. The action is great in the second half.<br />Colin Farrell is at his usual great performance. I would greatly recommend this movie. A fairly great storyline.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Its simple....I just am a big fan of this series!! I could not enjoy it any more than I do.
B00AG51V8E|4.0|This movie has a great plot and there was enough great action scenes. It held your interest throughout.<br />Plus, I wanted to see Henry Cavill in a movie, before I purchase &#34;Man of Steel&#34; when the DVD is released.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I liked the creativity of the gameplay in some parts, like needing to shake the Kindle to get an item at one point or rubbing something with your finger instead of looking for a rag. I didn't like the rest of the gameplay, though. It's not intuitive at all, and there's way too much trudging back and forth between locations. It's even worse because there are a lot of scenes that are completely unnecessary. (I don't need to zoom in on every door before I can go through, I just want to click on the house and go in.) I also hate it when you have something in your inventory that would do a job, but you're stuck looking for something else. (Like having a pickaxe but needing a sledgehammer, for instance, or having a well but needing to use the waterfall.) It completely jars me out of the game and it's frustrating, like all the going back and forth. It was also uninspiring as an Alice in Wonderland game, I expected something stranger, especially after the beginning where I needed to change size a few times. That could have been an interesting gimmick if held up throughout the game.<br /><br />Edited to add: I noticed other reviewers mentioning bugs, but I didn't have any problem, so the game may have been updated. Nothing was in French, there were no glitches, and I was able to skip the frustrating spinning-wheel puzzle thing.
B008XNZMOU|2.0|It seemed like it was difficult to distinguish a lot of the words to many of the songs. Not as entertaining or enjoyable as her first 3 or 4  CDs. There was probably only one song on the CD that I really enjoyed. I personally do not think this is one of her better releases.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is my third read! Always new, always an education, always a philosophical challenge. The thoughts, well presented are as provoking of consideration today, as relevant now as then, and the heroic effort of Hugo as significant today as when published. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it really matches up with the movie and makes me just want to watch the movie more
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|The Conjuring is the best Horror movie that I've seen in quite some time. True horror movie junkies will love this movie.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I think I liked it more once I made it through the season.  I've heard so much about it and was curious.  I'm enjoying the second season more so far, but I'm so glad I started watching at the &#34;beginning&#34; to understand small details later in the show.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|The plot line isn't going to blow your mind, but it's a very entertaining movie.  I really liked the post-apocalyptic landscapes, chase and dogfight sequences, and feel of the movie.  It wasn't over done in the special effects department, although it's obvious that MOST of the imagery has to be computer generated.  It looks real and didn't detract from the movie.<br /><br />So don't expect a masterpiece, but DO expect a fun flick to watch with the lights turned off and the surround sound turned WAY up!
0061478784|5.0|This book is a delight to read.  It seems to be written more for middle schoolers, which shouldn't have surprised me since the movie is animated.  I love that the romance isn't the whole theme of the book; I believe a good fantasy should focus more on unraveling the secrets and learning about the magic than the emotions of the characters.  However, a down-played romance can often become a neglected part of the story, which is disappointing; this was not the case for Diana Wynne Jones.  The hero and heroine had time to get to know each other, and fell in love slowly.  (There's nothing I hate more than 'Cinderella' romances where the two and instantly in 'love' after one meeting.)<br /><br />None of the characters were perfect; in fact, Diana tends to focus on making them over-flawed.  In the interview included in this printing, she herself comments on how strange it is that, despite her creating such flawed characters, she still has a whole list of girls waiting to marry Howl.  I think this isn't really as surprising as it seems.  A character must be flawed to be realistic; no matter how much a girl loves that 'perfect' guy, if she can't find any flaws, he'll eventually become too perfect (read: boring) to live with.  With Howl, on the other hand, Sophie will never have a dull moment.<br /><br />Most fantasies have either a generally serious tone or so much humor the story is ruined.  This is the first fantasy I've read that perfectly balances the seriousness of the magic with the humor of the characters.  This, I think, is where the movie disappointed previous readers of this book.  The movie has that characteristic serious tone.  While the company definitely did right casting Billy Crystal as Calcifer, there just wasn't enough time to truly capture the author's humorous spirit.<br /><br />That said, I really have to give this book two different ratings.  As the middle-school fantasy novel it was written as, it deserves all five stars.  For teens looking for a fantasy romance, though, I'd give it a three and a half or a four.sy romance, though, I'd give it a three and a half or a four.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Watson builds an amazing web of intrigue with the details of a struggling amnesiac who is seeking to find out the truth about who she is and whom she can trust. The unfolding of the plot will have you on the edge of your seat as you try to figure out what's true and merely a figment of Christine's amnesia. The book is fantastic!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Though some people don't care for this version I think it's a great presenation.  The soundtrack was amazing, the acting was great.  my ONLY complaint was the 'disfigurement' of the Phantom was very weak.  He looked like he had a minor grease fire incident; not a life altering disfiguration... Only quip.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|Pages would start with sentences that have already been said. I would have this changed and be fixed because it was annoying.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really like this app.  Several pics to choose from.  Love the surprise monthly puzzle of the day. Easy to use too
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Really fun some are easy and others have you thinking for quiet some time highly recommend though they should give you more than just one coin
B0061S073A|5.0|Very easy to set up and manage.  I would recommend it to anyone. All other apps failed, this one works and is free.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|I like it. It really gets me thinking. I feel like some of them make you think outside the box.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE  this app it is so fun it is totally worth it. It is so funny the way they talk and run
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great book with great insight.<br /><br />I stopped eating wheat 4 weeks ago and felt great until I had a cheat meal and became ill.  I believe going 100% gluten free is the way to better health.  Also,  Lose the wheat, lose the belly!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|is the end of the dirt caused by the utensils when cooking,<br />It's a very good gift too,<br />Easy to clean, to use and store
B005QYKD4I|5.0|This movie has been my sons favorite movie, and the action quality of the movie is really good. I think this movie is superb.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I can't get it to work, It keeps asking to add location, when I do it does NOTHING !!! And it does not pick USA.....
B007TKT2SK|5.0|For this for working with during my remodeling.  Does it have&quot;everything&quot;?  For my needs, yes.  My wife uses it for quilting and sewing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is truly amazing I finished it within a day I recommend  this book to all ages every book type
0553296981|5.0|This little girl's journal is priceless. I have read it at least once before. Not sure if school kids read this today as they are so enamored with fashion, itunes, ipods, iphones and celebrity,,,but they should.<br /><br />We are seeing similar threats coming out of the Middle East today with the rise of terrorism and Islamofascism. Israel is threatened as never before. Sadly, our president is MIA on this issue and the fire is spreading faster and faster.<br /><br />We must never forget!
B00280LYIC|5.0|AMAZING book, couldn't put it down. If you're up for \\"on the edge of your seat thrills\\" this is the book for you!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. I would recommend it to anyone.<br />Too many words are needed for a review.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|A Great Game that everyone should try. Very challenging. 5/5! Everyone should pitch in to support Gameloft to create more games like this. It reminds me of Starcraft for some reason. Lol
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like to play this a lot. Only trouble I have is seeing the tiles. They can get really small when the game board is bigger. Other than not being able to see the tiles I really have fun with this game.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Gave this to my mom for mothers day, she was in heaven for weeks rationing out episodes to herself. Great gift for the generation who grew up on this kind of TV!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game. Like the other game Jewels Legend, it can be addicting so I do have to watch myself.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is awesome! But it should have a video recorder thing or a video chat thing. Then this app would be the best ever to me!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game also. I play solitaire a lot with cards so I enjoy playing it on the tablet.
B008NNA6OG|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. This 2-Disc edition came in great, new, packaged condition! I gave it as a gift, and my friend absolutely loved it! This movie is a must-see classic. I could watch tap-dancing forever. :)
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Never saw the movie until recently and Matt Damon gives another great performance.  Great suspense in the movie and it keeps you on your toes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Places things in better understanding.  Ready for second book. Actually like the book more than the movie, part two can't wait.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Awesome game, pretty challenging, luckily there's unlimited hints, and if there was a limit, I didn't use all of them
B000V6738U|5.0|Seems like all the hits. They were(are) so innovative...tightly produced. Their music stands the test of time. Nothing you hear is accidental.
030759565X|4.0|Deb is an awesome teacher. She brings wit, charm, and humor to her writing. Her blog is one of the most informative and engaging out there and that same charm is distiller in her wonderful cookbook.  Great ideas and lessons along with her insight into why flavor s work well together. A must have.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Have heard so much about the movie, the book, that I really wasnt interested in reading it, thought it another twilight thing.  I was so wrong.  Even though the writing seems geared toward a teen audience, I could not put it down.  Great story with unexpected turns.
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|This figure is amazing, the detail, color, height is just outstanding, The figure is like an inch wider and bigger than the other Luffy figures by Figuarts. I got mine for $30 but at $35 its still worth it. 5/5.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|We watched it first through Netflix but then wanted other friends to enjoy so we plan on lending it out so our friends can see what ware really is.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|The characters became a part of my life...the Woman in White a mystery that tantalized throughout the story.<br />I fell in love with all three of the women in the story, all with different personalities,
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Had not seen the last episode - but because I have Prime - I was able to see the episode.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book it's a great read it captures you from the very beginning and your left with wanting more
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great games as all the Angry Birds are. Can't wait to find all the feathers. I like there being no pigs.

B005544V6A|4.0|Just catching on. Really enjoy this show. Am tired of having to have so many words to review something. Its a pain. I like it I watch it that simple.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Wonderful. Great acting, great story, happy ending. Just the kind of Saturday night entertainment you might be looking for. A fun flick.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great mobile version of diablo. fun to play and is constantly moving. requires little grinding and no necessary in game purchaces
B00B3EJ0OY|2.0|We had hoped to watch a romantic comedy or some uptone flick. What a surprise! I don't dig movies about concentration camps, no matter how &#34;artsy&#34; they are or how well received by the PC crowd in Hollywood.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love Jane Austen's prose and variety of characters; I wish I could write like her.  Pride and Prejudice is the best of all her novels.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|While I have nothing negative to say about the acting or production, DA plot can bend towards the overly melodramatic with too obviously telegraphed foreshadowing.  Also, no one likes the fact that they killed off Matthew.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love the characters and the storyand the setting of the story is wonderful. It would recommend this series to a friend.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Excellently done... One of the great movies of our time! If you are looking for a a tear-jerker of biblical proportion ... Look no further... The Passion of The Christ - 5 stars!!!
B0036TGT3E|4.0|It's perfect. No issue, no complaint, package is perfect, video quality has no problem, and it's a great movie, a master piece from old time Disney animation.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Have not played long, but definitely worth the download. As long as you are somewhat patient you can avoid the temptation to buy isotope gems.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Enjoyable memory and spotting puzzles. Pretty and elaborate artwork with a bit more exposition and cute dialogue than is strictly necessary. Good fornkids and playable by grownups too.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Any movie made today that I want to watch again automatically gets 5 stars from me!! Loved the makeup, characters and the message.
0061124958|5.0|My son read this aloud to me in 2nd grade and for the first time he laughed and enjoyed reading. From then on he's been a reader! Great book!
B00AK57N00|4.0|Straight up physics game, simple challenging and good.  It's fairly bare, minimal but fun and time passer...  Need 3 more words, there!
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|After reading three books that weren't very good, The Bat, was a nice change. I enjoyed reading it. Toward the end it got a little irrational but I enjoyed it anyway.  I will read more of his books.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|The best in the world is my favorite things to play on the road trip to north Carolina state university and great deal with great folks theft Information
B001NSAJ3G|4.0|First heard this in college.  My roommate had a three year old copy.  This was 1971.  You couldn't find it anywhere.  It was a little too &#34;out there&#34; in '68 and had been pulled and warehoused. Enough of us had heard it by '72 that they released it again.  Be rest is history.  The reason it doesn't get 5 stars,  when they remastered it in '78, some of the tracks of orchestra were left out and lost.  You probably won't notice it if you haven't 'heard it before, but to me &#34;Tuesday Afternoon&#34; is a little hollow.  Otherwise, it's still a great album.  No collection of classic rock is complete without it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app took so long to load on my Kindle Fire HD that I gave up. I waited for 2 minutes thinking that it must be some marvelous piece of software if they expect first-time users to stare at a blank screen for so long.  I will never know because I went to the web and was on YouTube in seconds.<br /><br />My advice: Don't risk pulling your hair out...skip this annoying app!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I never thought that Netflix could pull this off! What a terrific series. The acting was over the top. Can't wait for season two.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Its will not boot it takes for ever to load, its not worth downloading. its just pain  to see it work
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I've always loved Darius Rucker - back to Hootie & The Blowfish. You can really hear &#34;Hootie&#34; in some of these songs.
B0017P520U|3.0|Good movie, good computer CGI type film . Nice action , some dark scenes could have been lighter but good all in all.
030758836X|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but this was a fast read, had great characters, and lot of twists and turns. I will definitely recommend to friends.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Very challenging and exciting. Can't wait to try the sequel! I would recommend this to my friends anytime. Keep them coming!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I'm enjoying the challenges of playing Azada. It is a game that's not crazy difficult, but makes you think while having fun.
B00846REIS|4.0|It had a great storyline reminded me of the 50 shades trilogy but it held its own story line...I actually enjoyed it more than the 50 shades trilogy.
0316743003|4.0|nice info about the past and technology from there. mostly about the sr-71 and u 2 with some info on the b 2 program
B00DJXSKWU|5.0|You may look at the graphics and think the same as I did...eh I'm good. But this game is great!! I play command and conquer. And the first time on hard this game beat me badly. It may not be as big as it could be but it doesn't take up much space and has skirmish (or free play). Can't beat the price!! Btw I am running regular kindle fire not hd. Game runs smoothly.<br /><br />To The Creators; If you add dlc I will buy it. THIS GAME IS EPIC FOR TABLET! Would love to see more content though. Thanks for giving me a great RTS!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this series.  Clary and jace are great well rounded characters that fill out the story besutifully. Cant wsit gor the next one.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|The book was really good just not as good as woodsong which was maybe one of the best books I've ever read
0399255370|5.0|Great and fun child's story and interaction platform to explore the world around us. Awaiting the next in a hopeful series.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|This is just an absolute classic movie, doesn't get much better than this. Recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have an eyegasm
B00881VLCE|5.0|I find this app very relaxing after a very stressful day. There are some very pretty pictures, especially the August surprise pictures. Great app.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I think that the game is cool, but it should be a bit more challenging. The colors are cool however  the music is kind of elementary but overall it's cool!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|A great story of self reflection and courage.  Anyone who has been through a divorce (male or female) would benefit from reading this book.
1616550414|5.0|I was so happy when it finally arrived. It is well made and such a great book. The front cover is very beautiful and the perfect shade of green. It is filled with such beautiful artwork.
140006922X|5.0|This is a really tame retelling of information that's been around for quite a while.  Hard to understand what the critics are getting their knickers in a twist about.  The writer does an excellent job of laying out the material in a clear, understandable and objective manner, referencing biblical quotations, chapter and verse, as necessary and appropriate.
B0073Q0IY2|4.0|The cinematography and production of the film had a very strong resemblance to The Thing 1982, which is one of my favorite movies.  :-)
B00785P2QC|1.0|not much of a game more for kids<br />I was just not impressed. it passes time for my little girl
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Same comments as for &#34;Death Without Company&#34;.  This guy defines a low-profile hero.  Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This ap has worked we'll for me for a few months so far.  If I have an ap freeze or slow down scanning with this ap has fixed the problem.  I have been very pleased with the product and its free.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tried the free sample on my Kindle and just had to find out what happened next. There are a few scary points where yu fear the plot will fall  into one of the pits of triteness that ruins so many promising books, but he skillfully avoids them all. So I bought the Silo omnibus, but it looks like there's more Wool to read first. Definitely worth buying!
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|Overall Excellent flick--great script with mystery and a little suspense. Great acting with first rated stars!  i Highly highly recommend!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So easy to use and even talks to you during your workout/run/walk. Could not be easier to access all you need is a place to put your phone
0143034901|5.0|A coworker led me to this book and I truly thank him for that.  His prose is beautiful and it drew me into the story.  I have gone on to read other books by this author, but this is by far my favorite.  I highly recommend adding this to your list.
B004CGUC06|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY.<br />MY FAVORITE FELLINI FLICK.<br />MAKES A NICE DOUBLE FEATURE WITH CINEMA PARADISO.<br />BUY YOURS TODAY.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|A time killer for sure. You want to waste more time, have nothing to do with the time on your hands? Then this is the game for you. It is very addictive, I worn you now.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire stopped working with the cable that I was using for it. I received this as a replacement. I was Immediately able to charge up and use my Kindle Fire again. Highly recommend!
B0031KE9C6|5.0|The show is just so Cool! Kristen Bell is fantastic and the supporting cast is great. The writing for the<br />plot keeps interested and seems to not let up.<br /><br />Watching Veronica work her magic to solve cases is done very well.
B00AO686L0|5.0|This is the most exciting movie I have seen where no gun was shot, no bomb exploded and no terrorist group was terrorizing.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Michael Mann movies.  This is a far cry from Miami Vice in plot.  But the character development and underlying tension are the same.<br /><br />This Is Pacino when he was not a robot.  Perhaps second only to Heat.<br /><br />Russell Crowe playing a role unlike any other for him...as near as I know.<br /><br />The scene when Weigand's deposition is being taken is a must see.<br /><br />Taste in movies is highly subjective.  But this is a winner in my book
B00E13ZRFA|5.0|I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT EITHER!! ON MY RECENT VACATION TO ST THOMAS USVI I GOT THE WHOLE ISLAND HOOKED!!! LOVE IT AND LOVE ELLIE!!
B006ZZAMWK|3.0|What' can I say, Simon Cowell knows what teen girls want!  Maybe he will have one of this own now.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great story line, love the characters, but I might just be a sucker for lawyer shows with a twist. Reminds me of the show Damages during it's first couple of seasons.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|First volume was more engrossing; characters better realized.  But even so I am looking forward to volume three to see how the families turn out.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I sat down with the plan to watch this movie tonight, and it was just this 5 minute thing.  :(

B007SSF3O0|5.0|loved it when I watched it so many years ago - and still one of my favorite Jane Austen adaptations. Simple yet beautiful story. I know I will watch it again!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my little pony friendship is magic is very fun to play<br />the games are simple but trying to complete a task is actually changeling. the only thing I dislike about this game is the price for jewels and coins way to expensive. otherwise very phone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun and cute.I love all of the animals. Oh,and Kung Fu Scrat is fun. Best game EVER!!
B005EVVESM|4.0|I've liked Maroon 5's sound 'right from the git-go'. They've carried forth their music artistry right over to this release also. Should Maroon 5's music be enjoyable to you try this album on for size.<br />&#62;&#62;Don
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book has vibrant characters, with real personalities. I was easily able to flow through the whole book without getting stuck in boring parts. Can't wait to read what comes next!
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I confess the hit song 'grenade' caught my ear. I then found that the album had other good tunes; hence, it's mine.<br />&#62;&#62;Don
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I liked the humor and was glad it was not too much of a twilight zombie knockoff. I thought the take on zombies coming back or devolving fully was neat.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Worth watching. Maybe this is why the competant people don't run. Highlights the \\"machine\\" political system in Chicago and all the major cities.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Sometimes it works but sometimes it doesn't. When it dose work its a nice app. Please fix it or come out with a better Youtube app.

0425263991|5.0|I have read the whole series and can say that this is one of my favorites already.  Awesome book...you know it has to be good when that many people give it 5 fives.  Wonderful action and not alot of down time!! Hope the next one is just as exciting.
B0013ND30M|5.0|My nieces just love her as one of the Disney Princesses. They watch it every day. I would recommend on line shopping to every one. Fast service and no lines.

B004G6009U|5.0|She's a favorite of my nieces. They watch the Disney Princess line up every day. i would recommend it to all little princesses out there.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great clock app. Replaces, and is better than, the clock I had. Definitely worth the installation! I enjoy all of the features built into this app.
0062073486|5.0|Do not hesitate to get this book! This book is a classic, and kept me guessing until the very end! Definitely worth buying.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game great and entertaining but it is hard to collect keys and some of the golls are hard but it is fun if you are looking for a fun game this is it!!!!!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|It's been a while since a Star Trek series has been on and I thought I would revisit Enterprise since I never really got into it when it was on TV. Clean sci-fi and great concepts. I really enjoy the show now that the rest of TV has nothing really to offer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app amazing at first I thought about it because of the money but its todaly worth it !!!!

B008XKSW7M|4.0|What to Expect When You're Expecting is great.  It shows all facets of pregnancy and parenthood.  You can really relate to the actors and actresses.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If you are looking for a book about SEAL Training and all of that, I would recommend Mr. Couch's book \\"[[ASIN:1400046955 The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228]]\\". but if you are looking for a book about a man overcoming all obstacles to be part of the best special ops unit, then you are in the right place. Mr. Brown was the type of human being that is rare indeed: a gentle warrior. If you need some inspirational about to better yourself, or maybe your just curious to see if you can better then what you are now; then read this NOW.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|It has been an amazing tour around the world. A lot of research and brain work. I think this book greatly effected the way I look at the world and helped me to understand a little more about why we are how we are. Yet another step for me. The way Diamond presents in this book is not academic, which is preferable for me for the giant topic it covers. I respect the great work by Diamond.<br /><br />One downside of having this book from kindle store, you dont have maps, most tables etc. it feels like you are given a car without seats.. it takes you there somehow, but feels uncomfortable. Amazon need to fix these things.. I had to find and upload all these figures to my iphone and have my iphone with me all the time. Facit: I would not recommend kindle version.
0743270754|5.0|I have always been a Lincoln fan (my father used to take us to Gettysburg battlefield for vacation when we were kids!).  But this book was really good. It seems I could only read a few pages each night because it there so much information and so many things to think about to put yourself back in Lincoln's shoes back in that era. I never realized the silimarities there are between politics back then and today. It took me many months to read this book because there was so much detail, though I am usually a fast reader. I even watched the movie, but still came back to finish reading the book!
B00ADS98FC|3.0|It looked like it was a quality film in a lot of respects but honestly I just can't stomach the immoral crap in a lot of these movies anymore and I didn't think a lot of things were appropriate or necessary in this so I just didn't even finish it.
1932100660|5.0|I liked this book so much, that after I read it I turned vegan (2 1/2 years ago) and never looked back. What I really like about this book is that it is based on scientific studies (not testamonials), and the studies are explained in clear and concise language by the author Dr. Campbell who is also an MD. I believe this is one of the most definitive books on the health benefits of being vegan and I have shared this book with friends who read it and felt the same way.
B00846REIS|5.0|I will be reading all the books in this series! Sylvia Day gets more amazing with every book! Her characters are incredibly well done!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Well this case is amazing, it fits well and is sturdy. I have dropped it multiple times and not a scratch on it! Great case for the price
B005COO1X6|3.0|I love Stephen King, especially his early books and this starts out with the feel of his earlier works... innocent kid, mysterious truck stop, nightmare car that eats people.  And then follow pages and pages of it eating and eating  and each new character you know is going to meet the same fate, except for the hero kid...and the kid defeats the monster  in a way nothing short of ludicrous...<br />Alien travels through space but is defeated by a flicker of flame...
B001NPJGL0|5.0|product works as  designed ...but you  calibrate it by laying it on a level surface .<br /><br />While on the level surface you &#34; zero &#34;  it .<br /><br />Then it tells you how different  the new angle  where it is not setting..... is from where you zeroed it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is an amazing story that teaches true kindness. Recommend for 10 year olds. Great lessons that everyone she have.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I'm glad I finally gave this show a chance, it is excellent.The story and character depth are very engrossing and entertaining you begin to feel a real connection with the different people and the plight of the 2nd Mass. I would recommend this not only to Science Fiction fans but fans of good drama as well.
B0093X805W|5.0|My kindergarten son was devouring each page.  It was delightful, descriptive, funny, and an uplifting rags-to-riches story.  The candy alone will get the readers' mouths watering.  A surefire hit!
1907523588|5.0|Like a great poem, you are either captured by To The Lighthouse, are thrilled and amazed by its intensity and truthfulness, or you don't connect to it at all, and don't appreciate it.<br />The one, two, three and four star reviews are written by those readers who, for one reason or another, didn't/couldn't/wouldn't go along for the trip, who didn't connect (or by those who had technical complaints about the edition they purchased). But if you do connect it is inevitable that To The Lighthouse will become one of your best experiences with literature.<br />Appreciating this book is not an intellectual endeavor. There is nothing here outside the reach of any adult who can read. There is nothing to figure out, no literary codes to break. If you relax, go for the ride, trust that this is inspired writing, and find yourself on the bus, you'll not only love this book, but may even be changed by it.<br />After reading the first two or three pages I was thinking, \\"Oh please, not 'The Sound and the Fury', not experimental writing - yuck, not stream-of consciousness\\". But I was very wrong. It took me only a few more pages to understand that I was dealing with something else, something great and revealing.<br />It may be helpful to add that I would not have finished this book if I had picked it up as a young man. I'm certain of this. I wouldn't have connected and would have definitely been thinking many of the things the writers of the one and two star reviews here have written. But I'm also absolutely sure that there are many younger readers who are more receptive to writing that comes from these depths, or heights, than I was at their age.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I want my money back paid for it twice and its still locked i mean everything is locked fix it please thank you good day.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|went kind of stale for awhile...but overall decent....im a tom cruise fan though so it was worth it thank you
B00CO52NLI|4.0|This is a good game but I would like if  so you didn't have to pay a total of  $7.00 ( I counted) to get the animals other than hamsters, guinea pigs, and bunnies.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Reads oddly familiar but erotically fresh at the same time.  A good vacation book to share with your girl friends!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I love the little guys but this game is too fast for me. Nice graphics, I'll just stick to watching their movies!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|The series is an original combo of &#34;old&#34; things (horse buggies and farming with plows) and super advanced technology (space ships & laser guns) makes for a perfect geek fest!!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is really fun & addictive. I agree that the 30 seconds time limit is pretty short for beginners like myself but I feel in time I will get the hang of it. I can't wait to show it to my son. He is really going to love it. My 7 year old might even teach me something useful.
159114325X|5.0|Filled with fantastic photos of the ships overall as well as detailed photos taken on board.  This is a great book to have for model-builders, as more and more quality kits of these ships are being released all the time.<br /><br />Big, massive, heavy book - with tons of great detail on the inside.  Highly recommended!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Pretty fun game. I like Mario better but still a good knock off. Everything about it is great. Could use some more stuff but good
B009NY43NY|5.0|Though I was sad this book series ended I was pleased with how Ms. Harris &#34;wrapped-up&#34; everything. Sookie would be happy!
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Read the reviews for the off brand alternatives for the Canon BG-E7 Battery Grip.  Many of the off-brands have positive reviews and loyal followings. Holding both the XiT battery grip and the Canon, it is immediately obvious that the Canon build quality is noticeable higher: you feel in the weight and sturdiness of the body, as well as the quality of the button functionality. Cost more? absolutely, but worth every penny.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This is easily in the top 5 of my favorite android games.  Loaded with &quot;old school&quot; mechanics, funny dialogue and a very big world, D&amp;D is a must have for anyone who claims to be a fan of the days of SNES RPG's.  Also, you need tough skin because you will be reminded how much you love cheesy, clich&eacute;, and nerdy things the whole way through, but that is what will make you love this game and continue playing!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I started out playing this game on my phone.  It made my phone crash so often that I had to uninstall it. When I saw the app on my kindle Fire, I decided to give it a try on that device.  I loved it for a whole weekend until it started giving me the \\"game server is unavailable. please try again\\" error.  It screwed up my Kindle Fire so bad I had to deregister my device and register it. I had to redownload the app and had to submit a problem ticket to Disney Mobile Games restore my profile.  I had a temporary profile in the meantime.  I got an email saying my profile was restored.  I was supposed to turn the device off and back on again to let restore take effect - big mistake!  I started getting the same \\"game server is unavailable. please try again\\" error.  The customer service rep at Disney Mobile said they are having capacity problems and they're working on it.  It's been three weeks and I'm still waiting on still waiting on that resolution.  Meanwhile,  I thought I would try putting it back on my android phone, just to see if it was possibly my Kindle Fire that was really causing the problem.  But I can't even download the app to my phone because \\"the package file is invalid.\\" So, there's something seriously wrong with this app.  It's too bad because the game is AWESOME and so addicting... I just wish I could play it.<br /><br />*********UPDATE*****************<br />It's now been over two months since I've been able to play this STUPID game and I'm getting really pissed at Disney.  I've contacted them again about the problem and I'm still getting the same BS run-around answer.  They said, and I quote:  \\"Thank you for contacting us back. This work on the server optimization is still on going. Unfortunately it is taking longer than usual due to the large amount of regional servers. We regret any inconvenience this issue has caused for you and hope this issue will be addressed for all regions soon.\\"<br /><br />I have one word that seems to fit this answer: Shenanigans.  Crap.  I don't believe this at all.  This means they know there's a problem and they don't care.  So, the more you play this game, the more likely you are to encounter issues and eventually just not be able to play and then forget it.  And don't spend any money on anything because if you do, and then you decide that the game is crap and you want to uninstall it, they won't give it back to you.  I already asked and this is what they said: \\"If you choose to uninstall the game, we cannot refund your purchases as they have been delivered to you, and therefore the transaction has been completed.\\"<br /><br />Don't get this crap.  Because you'll really like it and get attached to it and then when it stops working, you'll realize that there's absolutely nothing you can do about it and Disney doesn't care.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so entertaining i love this game, so much fun. I definitely highly recommend this game to anyone :)
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Not much depth to this film.  The whole show was made up of explosions and the transformers changing from a car to a robot.  The roles were almost non existent and the scenes with the buildings being demolished, was wholly unrealistic.  I wasn't expecting much more.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The music the execution of the songs the photography - everything was fabulous. By far the most unexpected joy of the movie season,
B0076DELIG|5.0|The second Bosch novel I have read (The Drop was the first) and now I am compelled to begin at the beginning of the series. Solid mysteries, great backstory, set into real current events. Harry Bosch is a detective with a good head, good heart and has a built-in BS meter.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|... perhaps it is because of the movies popularity and servers just couldn't keep up. Finally gave up on this one too. Loved what I managed to see though!
B005K17RU0|4.0|The only reason i go to other weather sites anymore is for current radar for storms. Otherwise, this is by far my favorite weather &quot;go to&quot; page!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should make a pokemon update like the computer pixlecraft mod minecraft  is cool I whould like that<br /> pleasemake the update
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought this case when I bought my first kindle in February 2012.  After having this case for almost 2 years I can confidently say this case will handle just about anything.  The elastic straps that hold the kindle in are still firmly attached even after my now 3-year-old daughter has had &#34;custody&#34; of my kindle for the past year.  This case has handled spilled juice, marker, pens, and toddler fingernails (if you don't have kids, their nails are REALLY sharp).  The stitching is holding up beautifully, there are no loose or frayed seams. The kindle still fits snugly in the straps and there is no concern for it falling out.<br /><br />The only con for this case is the gold decoration, especially the flowers on the spine, are fading.  I'm sure this is from being constantly touched and rubbed against from my purse and my hands.<br /><br />Overall, fantastic case!  This case has outlasted 3 kindles, and I'm sure it can outlast a few more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I never have any issues. Awesome game when you are board or just want to play a game.  Love it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game. I'm addicted to it. So much fun, even my boys love it. It drives me crazy that I can't find macho.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game stinks because of the version add the nether the ender and the ender man wolfs and villagers and pigman ghasts blazes and HEROBRINE!!!!!!!!
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|The plot is truly unrealistic and lack excitement. No more Tom Cruise movies for me. I skipped the whole mission impossible phase and run into this ditch.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a fun free game and worth your time. Some people say it's scamming with in game purchasing but you can earn everything you can buy, you just have to work for it.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read this book in middle school and decided to read it again in high school. It is a great book, easy read, and has a very deep meaning!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is amazing.its the most addicting game that I have ever played.the tiger shark is what I have right now.just get it you won't regret it at all:-)
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Excellent service. I really enjoy this CD. The songs are all time favorites. I should have purchased it a long time ago.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|this movie was very fun to watch. i saw it when i was little but i forgot the name and since then i was looking all over for it. I love this movie
B00985E3UG|5.0|The author presents a detailed and fair picture of the  food industry infested world we live in.  Well done, Mr. Moss! Thank you.
0385349947|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, who graduated recently from law school. This is a must read for all strong women who plan to compete in the job force. I can see why this has been a NY Times best seller since it debuted.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a favorite of all of the &quot;grands&quot;! Ages 5 to 10. GREAT FUN FOR ALL!!!!!! Perfect companion to the movie.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|We thought this might be depressing and it is hard to watch at times, the ugliness of racism in the period... but the acting is phenomenal and ultimately the characters you root for do persevere and find a path forward... highly recommend it.
0061150142|5.0|I bought the paperback version of &#34;The Pact&#34;, with 496 pages. When I first saw the book I was skeptical about staying interested. As it turned out, there was no reason for my skepticism. This was an interesting read from start to finish. Picoult has a wonderful ability to create visually rich settings for entirely believable characters. I loved it!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Three books in and I still can't put them down! No matter how many pages or how many unexpected plot twists, I'm hooked!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Chromecast<br />1. Setup was easy with Chromecast guiding me to the URL and I was able to download an app and it recognized and configured Chromecast for me very easily. All I had to do was put in the Wifi password.<br />2. Chrome: You need Chrome to make it work on a PC. No PC app, which was very disappointing. Getting to install Google Cast plugin was a nightmare on Mac but very easy on a PC.  The Chrome performance was bad even static webpage text and pictures looked horrible even at the ultra settings. Playing video was a nightmare with huge skipping, static and lag. I tried both Mac and PC. I was able to play mkv movies directly from Chrome but with lag and bad picture quality. Even webpage scrolling lagged.<br />3. Iphone: No Iphone app yet. Netflix and YouTube apps come with Chrome Cast options. It seems to use the native apps while streaming from those apps. Video and audio quality was great.<br />4. I feel handicapped without a remote or a remote app for Iphone, PC or Mac app to use the native YouTube and Netflix apps on Chromecast. Which is seriously a drawback as at times I was staring at the screen and wanted it to show some kind of menu to show me those apps. Heck add a Chromecast remote plugin in Chrome. How hard would that be?<br />5. Basically it's only use for me would be a Youtube and Netflix player. If you have those apps already on your TV then it's of no use in it's current state.<br />6. I wasn't able to review the Android app performance or Google play video/audio performance as I do not own an Android device.<br />7. I don't understand the current positioning of Chromecast product except it tries to add some kind of broken screen mirroring with Chrome. It tries to do the same thing as a laptop connected to a TV using HDMI but fails tremendously at it, with limited functionality and poor performance. The $35 price shows in the performance and limited functionality.<br /><br />Apple TV<br />I own and Apple TV so might be a little biased but I do not have any use for Chromecast. Apple TV performs flawlessly and mirrors the mac screen with no lag no matter what is playing on the screen. A 1080p video runs and streams flawless and any text and images look great and things scroll with no lag. With it's $99 tag it has much better mirroring functionality, which alone is worth the $99 in my opinion, plus it comes with a remote and great video/radio/podcast/espn/news apps.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I was unclear if JL could act after seeing the Hunger Games - and she was great, along w Bradley Cooper and Robert De Nero. It was a mental health fairy tale
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is the best app ever! It's free and i love it! I got it thinking it would be bad, but it has hd quality videos and really great stuff!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Excellent book, Scalzi one again proves he is a wordsmith of the highest caliber. Delightfuly mind bending from beginning to end (Even if you're not a trekkie)
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Some good acting, but I thought the ending was pretty weak. McConaughey rocks in the title role, the kid playing Ellis and the guy playing Ellis's dad are both good.  The story is implausible but hey it's a movie with a guy living in a boat that's stuck in a tree.  What did I expect?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely a fun and challenging game. Kept me interested! I am ready for more levels!! Graphics were great...worked perfect on Kindle Fire!
B006FTCGXY|5.0|Great acting and directing by a young a sensitive talent. Guilt and bitterness overcome what could have been caught up in a cynical approach of modern dramas.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I confess, this app is and was great. It worked perfectly, my videos downloaded quickly... but there's this little bug.<br /><br />When I want to see who replied to which of my comments, I have to use the desktop version. When I switch to it on here, I can't switch back at all. Not by pressing mobile, not by tapping the tubemate link, nothing. Thus, I'm forced to uninstall and reinstall the app for it to work again. Maybe, if there's a way to change this, you guys could do so?
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|If u guys didnt get the joke brad pitt played in a movie called kill'em softly so it could of been consider copy right infringement. Lol but yea to the movie it was fun action but it nothing like the other 4 sequels. It wasnt worth going to see in the theaters but not bad to rent just to say u have seen all of john mclane.
B003WRM7QI|1.0|We rented the video on amazon it worked until about 1 hour into it the video froze.  We tried multiple times to fast forward and rewind however it would not go past the time of 1:18.  The movie was completely downloaded.  I would like a refund since we were not able to watch the whole thing.
B008JFUORW|5.0|How can u guys say this movie suck! I was on the floor laughing. Mr. Cho owned this movie! Also the storyline was pretty good by tying things together from the original hangover movie. Overall i this movie was a great way to finish it but i still wish they didnt have to finish it!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun cute and addictive. If you like bubble witch saga or bubble safari you will love this. Instead of point and shoot. You aim a slingshot.
0061537969|5.0|Mr. Stein's writing flows so easily.  Having worked at a dirt race track, (hooking up scales, weighing winning cars, driving pace car) I found his knowledge of racing and the rush it brings, so very real.<br /><br />Told from the dog's voice, it was such a unique concept and this dog was absolutely hilarious!!  (I'd like it if he'd write one from a cat's perspective).<br /><br />I laughed all the way through this novel, and then I cried, happy and sad tears, probably harder than I've cried in a long time; what a wonderful release!<br /><br />I was about to begin re-reading it because I loved it so much, but decided instead to start on Garth's other two novels.  I began \\"Raven Stole the Moon\\" last night and it already has me hooked.  Awaiting on my nightstand is \\"How Evan Broke His Head and Other Secrets\\".<br /><br />As far as \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" this scored a Perfect 10!!
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|This album is a classic, every song on it is good. That's all I'm gonna say about it right now!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome show and great fun watching on my kindle HD! I love being able to watch all episodes. With no commercial interruption !!
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|I find myself eschewing American TV lately for these absorbingly realistic British series.  The people in this show quickly seem real and transport you effortlessly into being part of their fictional world.  In Broadchurch, the seaside town is a seemingly caring, close-knit small community.  Their warmth and connection to one another is heartening, and immediately puts the viewer on notice that the murder of one the village's children will affect all who live there.  The newcomer is the new DI Alec Hardy, who has taken the spot from his new assistant Ellie Miller while she was on vacation.  References to a dark past make you wonder about his brusque, almost-pompous attitude, and heightens the tension between him and the close-knit police force & neighborhood he has dropped into at the start of investigating the worst crime the town has supposedly seen, the murder of an 11-year-old boy.<br /><br />I enjoy how normal and non-stereotyped the British actors in this police show are, and the dialogue rings true and succinct.  Also, not having visited, the scenes of this British beach town are a delight to see.  I look forward to continuing to watch the investigation unfold as well as learning the deeper emotional lives of this multi-faceted program.  Why can't American producers use real-looking characters instead of showing us stories populated with character \\"types\\" and starring \\"beautiful\\" people of normal sizes and shapes?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I cant get enough of subway suffers!! I encourage everyone to play this game, once you've played a few runs, you'll be hooked!
B0088W6LGY|5.0|Amazing, fun, great sci-fi, would recommend to everyone who likes sci-fi. To bad they stopped it and merged it into ST:U
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am 13and I like this game my older brother also likes it.  In my opinion it is a better temple run!
B004SVM7BW|5.0|The RepliGo PDF Reader is an excellent app. I use this app to make notes on my Sunday school lesson plan for 2nd graders.<br />Thank you for making this wonderful app availble to end users.
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|This app was free so I am not mad, but this is the worst sudoku game ever. The app force closed the time before I deleted it.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|love the music,  lyrics are as real as life. check it out for yourself.<br />feather on the clide and the things that stop you dreaming are my favorites.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Definitely a great read. This book will keep you on edge the entire time. Don't expect a cliche story of oppression and uprising. This book has action, love, drama, and a nice touch of realness. Very good read and id recommend it to everyone.
B00338QENI|5.0|I downloaded this book for school, but the storyline is a really good read for anytime. I have recommended this book to my family and friends.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|My wife and I watch 'That Metal Show' on VH1 Classic every Saturday night we are able to, and we heard Don Jamison recommend this album.  So, because I remembered the title from my Recommendations listing I went a reviewed the mp3 samples.  We are hard rock/heavy metal fans, but we really love the southern rock sort of sound more than any other genre.  Well, we found out that this band combines both sounds perfectly!  We both thought it started out a little more country music than we like, but it very soon makes us forget about that issue entirely, with sonds like 'One Horse Town', which is a very soulful lament about being stuck in a town with little hope and little ambition to change that at all.  It's a slower ballad, but a lot of people like me can identify with this complaint.  Other great songs include 'Not Much Left of Me' and 'Leave A Scar'.  But, truthfully we feel like virtually every song on this album could be a radio hit; but most people will probably like every one of the songs here.  We have no regrets about purchasing this album, and you probably ain't gonna neither!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I love candy crush I was mad when I found out I couldn't down load it on my kindle.. Get the game Amazon everyone plays it..

0446530573|5.0|I love italian food and pride myself on cooking it well. I ordered this cookbook and let me tell you. Their recipes are the real deal. I grew up eating these very recipes. They do not disappoint. A lot of italian cookbooks have it all wrong. Adding basil to EVERYTHING and ingredients that just don't belong. The recipes in this book are very clear, easy and very delicious! If there is one great italian cookbook, this is it baby! Mangia everyone!

B005LAIGQ4|4.0|I LOVE THE MOVIES AND I AM ALSO COLLECTING THEM FOR SOMETHING TO WATHC WHEN THE GRANDKIDS ARE HERE TOO,
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is one of my fave movies of all time and the Blu Ray does it good justice. I wish it was a bit more widescreen but the picture quality was outstanding and there are lots of great special features here too.
B000F4RHB6|4.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVE HIS MUSIC AND ALWAYS WILL. I HAD SOME GREAT TIMES LISTENING TO IT AND IT BRINGS BACK GOOD MEMORIES.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I really like the Ebay app.  It remembers me, shows me everything I want to see and links me to Paypal with such ease. Couldn't be easier to use.

B000OVLBFS|5.0|....maybe it's the ambiance, or the nourish, mood setting music, or the beautiful photography, or the slowly drawn out plot lines, or the wonderful character development, or, well, I'm running out of adjectives.<br />Tom Selleck is perfectly cast as small town police chief Jesse Stone. Imperfect, divorced, alcoholic fired ex-cop Jesse Stone finds new life in Paradise, Mass., and you won't want to miss one minute of it.<br />In this first installment of the Jesse Stone series (actually the second, but see this one first), Jesse finds himself being harassed by the mob. Stephen Baldwin is absolutely perfect as the bad guy in this movie. Do yourself a favor and just watch Night Passage first, and you will be hooked. The next seven in the series are just as well made/superbly directed as this one. After you watch this series once, you'll want to watch again - and again. The over 40 crowd will probably more appreciate the \\"atmosphere over action\\" style of this series. Enjoy!

B000OLX4SU|4.0|Good acting good directing and a good remake of the classic from 1931.  Some interesting twists but generally hols to the book

B001XUH69Y|5.0|Casablanca is an example of an almost perfect movie.  I say almost because I don't believe in perfection.  From the writing, to the cinematography, to the direction, and of course to the acting of everyone in the film, Casablanca takes us on a journey that we don't soon forget. There is not a wasted moment in the film.  It is a real lesson in fine film making.
0439796644|4.0|I LIKED THIS SO MUCH I BOUGHT THE MOVIE  I AM A HORSE NUT ANYWAY I THOUGHT I WAS GREAT
B00AR1G3FS|1.0|The audio is horrible, the standard DVD audio is 10 times better.<br />Not sure if there is a problem with the disc, but played it on more that one system with the same results.
B005DI66N4|4.0|THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE AND IT WAS A TRUE STORY SOMEONE SHOULD TAKE THE TIME AND DO THIS
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting! I will never forget the experience of being with my Pop as be passed away. As time passed I quickly realized he is now always with me. The book helped me see why.
B00A27X972|5.0|Good writing.  Witty. Good Psychological perspective of being human.  can be easily read in a couple of days.  Highly rcommended.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|A funny, easy-read.  People are mistaken if they take it as a parenting advice book.  Chua's depiction of herself was clearly satirical- self aware of her faults.  I appreciated the challenge to the idea of just letting kids do what they want.  I have always wished I was pushed more as a child to excel in something and its fun to read about how that worked (and didnt work!) with her kids.  A very quick read though, and not at all challenging.  Definitely a beach book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This has a nice fun twist to the origional. get it! its worth it. and its free. I mean. there's not many people who don't have it....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good entertainment for those down minutes in a day.  Each level has a different room to escape from with new clues and gadgets.
B0001I562I|4.0|This is a very good movie for both children & adults. It's clean & almost no violence in the movie.
B002N1AF7C|5.0|If Pink Floyd picks up on your vibe, you're doing more than okay. An influential album to say the least.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great for all ages! I love playing it and watching my children play it. I would recommend this download to anyone!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|The transfer from dvd quality to blu ray was done well.  Picture quality is top notch and matches the quality of this childhood classic.  A must have for any Goonies fan.  Loved the packagung of the 25th anniversary edition and the contents are pretty cool.
B004N6369Y|4.0|I have been reading Danielle Steel for many many years now. And once again I wasn't disappointed . Good job Danielle.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This iconic franchise is a must have for any fan. Looks better, sounds better but it feels the same. The same as when I first saw them. Awesome!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Love college football...this is a feel good movie, not to mention great acting by Sandra Bullock. Funny, moving, and tender.
B000IEPFCG|5.0|Yes, you might have to adjust the time once a week or so, but you are not buying a thousand dollar watch here.  This looks great on your wrist, works well and is reasonably priced.  I have never had a problem with it since day one and I never take it off.  Never.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I'm just doin  this for coins soo9ooo9ooooooooooooo.....<br />doodiddlydoodumdum<br />I do love this app. like a lot<br />h's dad gxvvzf xfdfg
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Thought the whole movie could have been summed up in a 20min cartoon. We really didn't care for it. x
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the back and forth format. Each character has their own drama. Blending together  suspense is so well written ..keeps the reader guessing and involved.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It was a little difficult to get into but when I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Also, there are a lot of different characters and it was a little hard to keep everyone straight. But a good read.
067144901X|5.0|My son that is now 31 wanted this book for his 1 year old son. We LOVE Sandra Boynton books and this is a charmer! Great service, super fast shipping, good price - and a book that will make everyone smile and sing along.
0449011909|4.0|One thing I'm getting really tired of is narrators who mispronounce words and the fact that, apparently, nobody in the production corrects these mistakes when they happen.  How can a talented British actor mispronounce English words anyway?  For example, lichen pronounced as \\"litchen\\" or grievously pronounced as \\"gree-vee-us-ly\\"--that one is the strangest because he pronounces \\"grievous\\" correctly but can't seem to say \\"grievously.\\"  Ninety-five percent of the English-speaking world would probably not even notice this stuff, but no one is ever going to notice if we keep perpetuating ignorance of our own language.  In other words, if annoying people like me don't bother pointing it out.  That's what really bugs me about these mispronunciations in audiobooks: there's an entire staff and production team involved and not one of those people know how to pronounce \\"lichen\\" correctly?<br />That aside, I think Roy Dotrice does a great job; there's obviously a lot of skill and effort involved.  But I think audiobooks are starting to get overly performed.<br />Sometimes it just detracts from the story (like Lord Tywin or his son Tyrion--the way he has them talk is terribly annoying).
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Great book. Easy story to follow and enjoy. It was a perfect thing to read at the end of the day.
B000IDCJK8|4.0|I love watching Clint Eastwood western movies, but this one bothered me a little since he usually plays a gentleman with the ladies protecting them. The scene of him raping a woman was a little disturbing. Other than that it was a great movie pointing out how fear stopped these people from protecting their town.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|The first movie has always been my favorite.  Overall good buy. Worth every cent. Will re watch it on DVD many times.
B006S08RLU|2.0|New audiences of this generation are going to find this movie boring. i hated the first 15 or so minutes of the narration.  I dislike documentaries, and the opening of this film pretty much opens that way. This film, it sure isn`t a kids movie, since it has some sexual, alcohol, and drug themes in its content.  You must be high to like such film. The nice colors, nice music and cinematography doesn`t convince me to give this film a good rating.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I have never played an electronic soduko game so l cannot compare to others but I found this one fun and easy to learn. The game did freeze up on me twice so far which is why I did not give it a 5.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Stopped watching after 30min in due to being so boring.  I wouldnt not spend my money or time on this movie.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|A fun game especially to let aggression out in a safe way.  I would not recommend this to people who get frustrated too easily as some of the structures are hard to knock down.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|This is a wonderful and sexy movie, wish they would make another but alas I will have to settle for the new show on NBC.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Like it a lot, keeps your mind busy, and it has more levels of difficulty's, very much appriciated by me!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I have seen this on TV several times.  I was really great to be able to watch it uninterrupted by commercials.  Danny DeVito did a great job in directing and producing this movie.  His narration was superb  However the very best part of the movie was the performance by Pam Ferris as the villainous principal.  No one else could have done this.  It is very incredible to realize that she is one of the detectives in the British series Rosemary and Thyme.  It shows what a incredibly versatile actress she is.
B0063M22QO|3.0|nice game, always liked it, nice to have some different levels and layouts. I play it while waiting, you can quit anytime
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|We saw this last week while on vacation.  My daughter wanted to have it so I purchased it for her.  I think she has watched it everyday since I got it for her.  Great movie!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great Documentary.  Well produced and the music is classic.  The new sessions at 606 are cool to see as well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|More family television that tells a good story and keeps the language and nudity to a level that children may watch.  Please keep it that way.  These types of shows are becoming harder and harder to find. The historical value can be seen from different perspectives which is also a refreshing way of portraying certain conflicts.
030758836X|5.0|This thrilling read keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is a page turner, that winds you into a couples own madness.  You find yourself relating to them both... understanding their hurt, but a sick eternal perfect love.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|cooler than the first tapil run its so much more fun I love how the gems can come out and if you jump u can get tham and I love how there only one monkey -the fact that that its big but oh will :)I love the 2one :)  is cooler and bedded than the 1 and awesomer
0307341550|5.0|I really like Ms. Flynn's style.  It is twisted, and descriptive, just enough to keep you entertained, guessing, and reading... Sharp objects keeps you guessing until the very end, with vivid flashbacks of why the character is the way she is. Loved it.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|Too long, too slow not an epic. It was a disappointment, because the plot is confusing. Not as much action as I expected no suspense what so ever.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS GAME BECAUSE I LIKED PLAYING THE ONE AT A TRUCK STOP I STOPED IN GIVES ME HOURS OF FUN
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing series, surprised to find out there will be a fourth, but can't wait to read it! Better storyline than 50 shades.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Zimmer's music is always meet to set an exciting or dramatic mood. He is one of the best st this. For this soundtrack the drum orchestra he assembled is stunning.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The tiles were hard to read and it was not fun.  There are better ones out there to play if you look.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very interesting characters and intertwined stories. Wish the ending didn't come so soon but very entertaining and would  highly recommend this read!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a wonderful, multi-tiered game with beautiful graphics and challenging puzzles. We need many more like this one.  Worth the price!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Plus a set of knives and a few odds and ends. Really a great investment. I've had my set for about 3 months, but the friend who recommended them is 5+ year, with essentially no visible wear-and-tear.<br /><br />It should be noted that the first time I cooked with curry, I did permanently stain the green (wooden spoon?) tool. I imagine beets and other highly colorful foods will have similar effect.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Whoever did this should do.many more games.  Fun, challenging, and beautiful.  I've played it twice.  A great escape and brain challenge.  Wonderful interaction!
B002361MLA|5.0|I keep this by my bedside - finding myself re-reading and re-reading the little book over and over. Each time, the message seems to sink a bit deeper - drawing me more and more into the present. I find it especially helpful when work (or other life) stress gets up there - and I need a bit of help regaining my balance. BTW, I far prefer it to any of his other books - valuing the original &#34;source&#34; message that echoes throughout his other writing - this one strikes me as the purest, most distilled.
B00015YVD6|5.0|This is a very funny movie.Tom Hanks fans,this is a must own.Found it quickly,ordering was easy.The price was great.I recommend getting it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great writing, well acted. Solid period piece about a time that isn't done often. Worth a watch if you haven't seen it yet.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|For someone that listens to Hendrix,this is worth checking out.This is a collection of out takes and ideas that formulated into songs.Really listen to these takes.Its worth it,add it to your collection.Fast delivery,no hassles.Very good quality.Get it,today.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love it. I have been looking for an alarm clock. This is perfect for me'<br />It looks. Beautiful. I can't wait to use it.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|This movie will have you examining your life.Consider the possibilities.Putting yourself in this situation,how would you deal with it?Very interesting start to finish.And the ending,asking yourself  where do I go from here?
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|This game was very fun the first few times I played it, but it will no longer launch.  Hopefully it will be fixed soon because this is a great app.  5/5 if it still worked.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really love playing MAHJONG:  MAHJONG is the gaming of all the years I played it.

B009B4ZEKM|5.0|iam a huge fan and this one is one of her best it has great beats with some really nice ballads that show of her amazing voice. I recommend it to everyone this cd has more then a few songs that are good so it is worth a while its great
B0063IH60K|5.0|I probably play solitaire more than I do most anything on my Kindle except read books. This is a good verson too. And it was free......truly free.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Kids absolutely love , love, love, this game it is awesome & addictive ;) I woukd recocomend it for any kid aged 8^
B001RTP48Q|4.0|This CD, the same as for &#34;Format&#34; was not so known for me, but it keeps the PSB level of music.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I don't seem to be able to delete a book here after I've read it, which means I have to scroll through titles I've returned to the library.  Of course there could be a way I haven't discovered yet.  If that's the case, awesome, and I would gladly give the app 5 stars.  Kindle is a wonderful invention!
B002UWH8P6|1.0|terrible series  shouldn't be allowed to have the words stargate in the title.  don't waste ur time on this junk.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|This album is a melodic trip that sends you on a ride that you never want to get off. From Deceiver of the Gods all the way to Warriors of the North it's a great album. This is their most melodic in my opinion and it works.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Probably one of the greatest films ever.  This is the second time I watch, and saw many new things ..
B00CO52NLI|4.0|I love this game so I saved up my money to buy the horse,reptiles,and dogs and cats. Now that they have birds I'm saving up my money for them. But I am really disappointed that the dogs and cats cost $1.99 and the horses and reptiles cost .99.
086571701X|5.0|this is a good book that teaches the benefits of having an aquaponic garden, right now I haven't started yet because I don't have<br />the resources yet, I need to wait a little longer to start a small experimental garden to see how it works.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The Blind Side is a heart warming moving that gives you hope in the human race. It showed when it comes down to our base emotions our heart takes over and does what is right.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Loved it.  Intro rocks, great story line.  Ragnar is PERFECT!  Can't wait for a longer season 2.  Watch this now!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be outside the mainstream and maybe unrelatable to me.  But I loved it.  It is a fascinating look into the controversy over actual side effects of medication as seen through the movies' eye.  It has big surprises, but the actors are all so good I never knew what was going to happen.  The movie pulled me in from the beginning with the likeable characters, and I was enthralled until the last minute.  I didn't want the movie to end or the characters to disappear.  I think this movie is one that is successful in presenting both a look at an issue in society today as well as delivering characters who are fascinating to watch in their own right.
B007RJJVSO|5.0|I can not lie, when I first heard this album I hated it. It was nothing like what I was expecting. It didn't sound like Opeth and it didn't sound like &#34;Porcupine Tree&#34; but slowly over time listening again and again it has grown to be one of my favorite albums in quite some years. It truly is one of a kind.
B000BNI99K|5.0|4 cds of pure americana done Rod stewart style. He succeds on keeping it interesting for Rod fans how had no clue how the original artists of these songs were.
1582406723|5.0|I was pretty uninterested at first simply because it is in black and white, but the artwork is great and the storyline is even better. The journey of watching Rick Grimes evolve is an interesting one at the least. If you've been considering getting this book just do it.
B003L20IHO|5.0|I love this movie... La he visto muchas veces y no me cansare de verla... Una excelente historia..super recomendable.. Great
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I started watching Breaking Bad on the recommendation of a friend, and I can't stop. It's as addictive as The Wire.
B008PZZUTS|3.0|This movie is very watchable. I am a bit disappointed with the ending but overall the movie was enjoyable and made me wonder how everything would play out.
B003CHGV74|5.0|I started watching Breaking Bad on the recommendation of a friend, and I can't stop. It's as addictive as The Wire.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|After a while of using this app, it starts to buffer. It is really slow. I would really appreciate it if they fix it.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I love this movie. My favorite Disney princess. Rented it for my 5 year old grandson to watch. He loved it too.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I could not put down Mr. Gross's book.  I was enthralled with the plot and the characters.  It is a fantastic summer read.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I would give this item less than one star. First of all it doesn't have any contact information on the directions. There isn't any troubleshooting available in the directions.The print is so small that you need a microscope to read it. When trying to google DB Tech, you get referred to CA Marketing USA. When I finally found the correct page and asked for tech. support I was connected to a voicemail, a Jonathan V. to be exact. He said that to contact him directly, and not via email! I'm still waiting for his reply from emails, and phone calls. In the meantime I sent back the unit in question. I quest in futility, and time wasted is what I got out of this experience.
B000QY9WOU|5.0|I love everything she does and all the dancers, music, performance, all the times she changes outfits and the songs.....
B003VPWX6K|4.0|I read this book after I saw the movie (years ago) with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. All through the book I could just hear them! I love both of them so maybe that's why I rated it highly. Stevens is the very embodiment of the perfect English butler, to the point that he denies self. He really functions as if he does not matter, all that matters is serving Lord Darlington and seeing that the house is run exactly right. That mindset worked well when Darlington Hall was in its heyday but is outmoded in later years. It seems as though everyone has moved on except Stevens. He laments the loss of the propriety that was expected of him and all the staff. He spends much time explaining what greatness is in regards to butlers and questions whether he was ever one of the truly great butlers, like those 2 or 3 men he so admired. All thought and energy is focused only on being the best. He struggles to join the present day but really doesn't understand how to do that. He really doesn't understand how to carry on &#34;light banter&#34; and doesn't get the new owner's humor. The tragedy in my opinion was that he totally missed the cues coming from Miss Kenton the housekeeper. She admired him and wished for a relationship beyond the parameters of their profession but he just didn't get it. She finally left to marry, giving Stevens an open door to say or do something to let her know he would like her to stay but he was so focused on being professional that he missed it. Finally, when the new owner suggests Stevens take a holiday, he starts thinking about things that were said and done at Darlington and comes to the realization that he perhaps didn't see some of the nefarious things Lord Darlington was up to. He also realizes that he may have a chance to rekindle the relationship with Miss Kenton,based on a letter she sent him, so he travels to her town to visit. He is thinking that her marriage is on the rocks and maybe she will come back to Darlington Hall with him as housekeeper and maybe something more personal. Alas, he has waited too long, she is about to be a grandmother and cannot leave her family. They both lament the passing of the years but are too afraid to say what is in their hearts for fear of offending the other or making the other feel bad. He has never been able to read between the lines in any situation, personal or professional, feeling that it is not his job to do so. He doesn't get the nuances of human behavior, which is sad for him (at least from my perspective, he seems satisfied to 'carry on' as is.) All in all I really liked this book. I thought the movie was better, as it focused more on the relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton and you could actually see the facial expressions that undergird the emotions Stevens is feeling, or in his case, trying to pretend he doesn't have.keeper and maybe something more personal.

B0081J95TE|4.0|This was one of 5 Garbage CDs I ordered at the same time and it fits right in with the rest of the collection. Cleverly crafted songs with sometimes dark of morbidly humors lyrics. Simple melodies with oddly contrasting harmonies and arrangements. What I call, &#34;cleaver music.&#34;
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great techniques and hysterical commentary. I was worried it would be too scientific given the title.  However, it's written in a simple format that's informative and entertaining. Energy like you've never heard it explained before.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Watch this with warm popcorn and pals.  It's super cool movie. Hope they make a sequel with the same cast.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I first took notice of this band after Jason's \\"That Metal Show\\" appearance and I was quick to check out the EP and I was hooked on the unique metal sound that these guys are dishing out. Then I had the pleasure of seeing Newsted live about a month ago on the Gigantour and they put on a killer show! So, I was anxiously waiting for this album to be released and when I got my hands on it, I was not disappointed! Every metal fan should have this album, it's hard hitting from start to finish.
B00D6BQG1W|2.0|Didn't like this one much. It is very weird and slow. The movie is well done but the plot is just weird. Zombies are zombies. This movie makes zombies like Twilight makes vampires.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a classic and I loved it.  Recommended by a friend.  Watched it as we drove to Florida, made the drivve fast.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Well written book. It was a pretty fast read but it's more about the content than the length. What a heart warming story with every life lesson you'll ever need  made me cry. Loved this book
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|You will enjoy this action packed adventure. Grab some popcorn, sit back and cheer on Captain America the First Avenger!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Has some great ideas to try..some worked for me, others didn't. I'm trying to use the ones that did. Overall, a very good book.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|Hot Summer Nights or Just a Hot Summer Day enjoyment. What more would you want from a classic that opens Today's Kids eyes into when Kids were just Kids.<br /><br />Self Independence and spiritual thinking from start to finish!
B007PVHMCG|1.0|I was shocked at the size of this box. It's about a 6\\" cube very small... Definetly disappointed, not worth $50. I should have read these reviews before purchasing!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. The only problem is that it takes a number of attempts to see a movie from start to finish on Amazon Prime.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|ready for more levels like the graphics and the puzzles hard but too hard can not believe it was a free game
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I wanted the game on my Kindle Fire not the help guide.  It will not give me the option for the game.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Now I know what everyone was talking about.  Brilliant, I can't get enough. Looking forward to the next season. Five stars.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I want more of the these type of games.I'll be looking forward of more of the same<br />I'm also into finding games.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|this game is fun but after a short  while it gets boring - some levels seem unusually hard but there is always a way to win
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think that there should be more items and have 1 update every month. Also maps should be available in pocket edition. Thank you I hope you take this into consideration.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|I love all of these movies!! They're about friendship, bravery, magic...what could be better! I highly recommend them to anyone's who hasn't watched them.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I heard Little Talks while browsing at Walmart.  I asked a couple employees if they knew the song, they didn't.  A few days later an I heard the song at a Shell gas station and the attendant told me the title.  I like all the songs and await their next album

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Funniest book I can remember reading.  But, it's strictly a book for the female gender; can't see guys understanding or appreciating it.  If you're a woman over 30, it's a must-read.

B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Every single review on here either lauds or dismisses this movie as a clever remake.<br />I mean for god's sake, Ash freakin DIES in the end of the first evil dead! How does that maintain continuity???? If anything, evil dead II was a remake.<br />Yes, they take themes from the first three and blend them into an awesome concoction, but don't expect to find an Ash here. Ash is not yet re-introduced.<br />THIS IS NOT A REMAKE. According to the director and Sam R, this is another entry in the series.<br />Yes, there will be more.<br />Yes, there will be more Ash,(as teased if you watched all the way to the end, \\"groovy.\\")and in fact Sam is considering making two more, the second of which will wrap up and explain the loose ends. This is not written in stone, but it is the plan. So when you watch this, don't think it's yet another remake. It's another entry in the series.<br />The beginning grants us a bit of the back story Sam only had chances to elude to.<br />Imagine if the next one has Mia run into an older Ash.<br />Lots of possibilities.<br />This is not a comedy,(and by the way, neither was the origonal. Among many \\"Dead\\" fanatics, i heard early complaints that there was no comedy). WTF? Are you kidding? This movie is so well timed, each scene flows straight into the next, and if you get forty minutes in and need to pee, go, because from there on in it's pretty much non-stop.<br />Yes there's the requisite character stupidity, (poor Eric, the school teacher who couldn't resist opening that book, \\"dying wouldn't be so bad right now. i just don't want to end up being the devil's bitch,\\" yet David leaves him floating in the basement.(Make a grave for two!) Or continuing to remain in the cabin after finding the blood on the floor. In reality land, if you're bringing a junkie out into the middle of nowhere to detox, you'd probably take a look at said destination first.) but outside of that required naivety on the characters part, the Olivia attack, the crowbar, the arm falling off in the kitchen, the needle stuck in the ocular cavity under the eye............<br />HOW could you say bully to this film??????????<br />Don't let your own idea of what you wanted to happen ruin this movie. It's a good one.<br />Evil Dead or no. With another title it would be just as good.falling off in the kitchen, the needle stuck in the ocular cavity under the eye............<br />HOW could you say bully to this film??????????<br />Don't let your own idea of what you wanted to happen ruin this movie.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, with great acting, authentic script, a very nice story line, and an accurate portrayal of India as I remember it from a visit ten years ago.  Glad I own it, because I am sure we will watch it again.
1616551607|2.0|This compilation of work is not as good as expected. Although Mr Amano is talented, the majority of works portrayed in this 3 book collection are not as detailed as the cover picture. There are quite a few black and white ink drawings that remind me of flat graphic art. There are only a handful of pretty detailed line drawings with vivid color, but most of what you have here is like a water color wash over pen and ink drawings. The artwork also slightly reminds me of anime style work.  I have an extensive collection of fantasy art books and was expecting this collection to be of similar representation in style. Specifically I have the entire series of Spectrum Fantasy Art , which contains 19 volumes. Number 20 comes out later this year. Although I was not familiar with this artists work, I was expecting it to follow the styles as the majority of the artists in the Spectrum series. To me, the only worthy part of this purchase is the vivid colors in the pictures and the outstanding packaging design. Also, each of the 3 books are very well designed and constructed. There was obviously more attention given to the materials used in the design and construction of the slip case that holds the 3 books as well as the design and construction of the book themselves. I wish this work fell in the category  of &#34;Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover&#34;.  Overall, the cover and design of this slipcase edition puts the contents to shame.<br /><br />Greg Hoffman
B002N83H52|5.0|To get into the mind of this quirky man who rationalized his stealing as logical consequences of his desires is a feat of literary diligence.  The author is a lover of books and literature.  Through many interviews, she gained insights into the family history and into the compulsions of an habitual criminal.  What is surprising is how entitled the thief feels about confiscating books from public libraries, book stores, and book fairs.
B00B89LZ4C|1.0|I have been waiting for this for 2 months now and have watched the price rise. I opened the box and the packaging was open!!!! It is as if it was intentionally opened and sent to de-value it's future value. Everyone knows these will be worth good money if the package is not opened. This is worthless now! What a SCAM! If you are a collector stay away!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This App is pretty much the same as the temple run app. The only difference is the characters. The kids loved going and seeing the latest installment of Despicable Me, so they  really love being able to play the game. I would recommend this to parents who want to let there kids enjoy some downtime playing a fun game.
B006Z21ZEW|4.0|I've been a huge Maiden fan since I a young teen in 1986, so I naturally loved seeing their show.<br /><br />They certainly have plenty of cameras to capture every angle.  In fact, I'd say they have too many and they feel way too much need to show every angle using split screens all the time.  Split screen is fine, but learn to limit its use to a reasonable level.
B007IV11PM|5.0|Great quality for streaming online videos. Thanks oh, I love the show too. The Dr. Has changed so much over the years but is still brilliant with a touch (use mildy) of arogance.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. Puzzles are why I choose all my x box, PlayStation, etc games and this just wraps those all into one game with nothing but interesting puzzles that make me think.love it, starting chapter three which right now is a bummer to think I'm gonna het it done an the fourth but may have to be patient an wait for more. At least it will be worth the wait.j

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Bossypants by Tina Fey is part memoir, advice column, personal reflection,  and cultural essays,  but every part of this nonfiction narrative is humorous. Fey's writing style is comfortable and pleasant but at the same time she is side-splittingly funny. Fey does briefly cover growing up in Upper Darby, PA and she shares some unexpected but hilarious advice about how to keep your teenage daughter a virgin.<br /><br />There is actually some good advice on being a boss:<br />\\"In most cases being a good boss means hiring talented people and then getting out of their way.\\" (Page 5)<br /><br />\\"This is what I tell young women who ask me for career advice. People are going to try to trick you. To make you feel that you are in competition with one another. \\"You're up for a promotion. If they go with a woman, it'll be between you and Barbara.\\" Don't be fooled. You're not in competition with other women. You're in competition with everyone. Also, I encourage them to always wear a bra. Even if you don't think you need it, just... you know what? You're never going to regret it.\\" (Page 88)<br /><br />\\"But there is not one management course in the world where they recommend Self-Righteousness as a tool.\\" (Page 128)<br /><br />There is a touching chapter about her father.<br />\\"How can I give her what Don Fey gave me? The gift of anxiety. The fear of getting in trouble. The knowledge that while you are loved, you are not above the law. The Worldwide Parental Anxiety System is failing if this many of us have made sex tapes. \\"(Page 54)<br /><br />There are stories about her time with Second City, Saturday Night Live, and 30 Rock, as well as a chapter on a glamor photo shoot, and some stories about being a woman.<br />\\"However, of all the places I've worked that were supposedly boys' clubs, The Second City was the only one where I experienced institutionalized gender nonsense. For example, a director of one of the main companies once justified cutting a scene by saying, 'The audience doesn't want to see a scene between two women.' Whaaa? More on that later.\\" (Page 87)<br /><br />\\"In 1997 I flew to New York from Chicago to interview for a writing position at Saturday Night Live. It seemed promising because I'd heard the show was looking to diversify. Only in comedy, by the way, does an obedient white girl from the suburbs count as diversity.\\" Page 119<br /><br />I connected with so many of her stories, but some of the stories that deal with things only a woman would understand were priceless like the strident pro-breast-feeding moms  (Fey's name for them in her book is better - I would argue that it's not only breast feeding, but these dilettantes have moved into areas of food police, sports experts, and activity booking agents for their children) and the male producers not understanding why the Classics Kotex pads commercial for SNL was funny.<br /><br />Here are two more quotes for women:<br />\\"I had noticed something was weird earlier in the day, but I knew from commercials that one's menstrual period was a blue liquid that you poured like laundry detergent onto maxi pads to test their absorbency. This wasn't blue, so... I ignored it for a few hours.\\" (Page 14)<br /><br />\\"My mother knew the importance of getting the right fit for a bra, so she took me to JCPenney and tried one on over my clothes. She tried a bra on me over my clothes in the middle of JCPenney. I thank her for this. This early breast-related humiliation prevented me from ever needing to participate in \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" in my twenties.\\" (Page 104)<br /><br />Admittedly, Fey didn't delve in deep to her personal life of her deepest thoughts, but that's okay. She shared the information and stories she was comfortable sharing. While I did see Fey on SNL, I'll have to admit I don't watch 30 Rock. (Hey, I don't watch much TV - not enough time in the day to do it all.)  This didn't stop me from appreciating this very entertaining book and I'll look forward to another book from TinaFey someday.<br />very highly recommended<br /><br />\\"There is no one of-woman-born who does not like Red Lobster cheddar biscuits. Anyone who claims otherwise is a liar and a Socialist.\\" (Page 252)<br />True, so true...Fey someday.<br />very highly recommended<br /><br />\\"There is no one of-woman-born who does not like Red Lobster cheddar biscuits. Anyone who claims otherwise is a liar and a Socialist.\\" (Page 252)<br />True, so true...
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very well done film I wish they would do same thing with Aliens and Predators combine with other Sci-fi characters
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Everyone needs to own these movies!  They all look and sound great on Blu-ray. The included digital copies are a nice plus as it is convenient to take on my iPhone and iPad when I travel.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Wonderful, heartfelt book.  This book takes the &#34;teen angst&#34; to a whole new level.  Good story line, easy to read...LOVED IT
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We absolutely Love this Movie. My Wife had not seen this one so I got it. That way Despicable 2 has to be a 5 star as well. We have it now and plan to get 2 when it comes out on DVD to watch with the Grandkids......
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book - easy read.  Can't wait to finish the entire series.  Would highly recommend this series to those who like supernatural/mysteries.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I happen to be a Bio junkie. I can't get enough. But here's the thing: Patti Smith's bio is of a place, New York, and a time, the '60s. You've probably heard that that place and time is gone, and it is, but its relation to Smith is very interesting. Her touch and vision actually comes from an earlier epoch, France and the earlier 20th century. I began to marvel how light-heartened, mythical she is, and how toughened New York made her. The '60s itself reached far back into the early 20th century which makes its mythos so awe-inspiring. And then there is the deep love Smith and Mapplethorpe, two struggling, starving artists, always had for each other. Yes, this is a personal memoir, but as a visionary Smith makes it into more.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have used this workout often. It may not deliver the dropped pounds it promises but it is still a good workout. I worry sometimes about injury. But not nearly as much as I do watching Insanity.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Crazy what can happen if you aren't careful. I thought the ending of this movie was great and gave me the WOW factor that I love.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is the age old story of alien invasion which has been repeated to death, but the difference in this is that the story starts where every other story ends. This is the struggle of humanity after an alien invasion and a guerrilla war raised by humanity against the aliens. The unique thing about this is that it shows the entire range of human instincts in order to survive.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I was looking for an easy read and was recommended this by a friend. I really enjoyed the story and grew to really like the characters. I wish the ending was different but could see why it had to end like it did.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|This movie Had me sitting on the edge of my seat! I would recommend this movie to any person that wishes to kill some time on a rainy day
1878424505|5.0|I cannot stop reading this book the prayers are awesome I read these prayers every day they keep me grounded and know that I have some one to trust and count on.<br />amen.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I use this keypad with a Wacom Cintiq... It helps with the ergonomics of drawing with my right hand and using this keypad for my left hand for all my regular keyboard actions. It has worked out great.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|This is definitely one of those movies that the songs get stuck in your head for days at time. Amazingly enough, for me at least, they don't ever get annoying. I love this movie!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|How can Google be so successful yet fail to realize that maybe, just maybe, they might want to prepare for high demand on a capable streaming device that costs $35! Just like the Nexus 4 you won't be able to buy without waiting until the device is obsolete. Once again another great product from Google that will cease to gain traction because they decided to keep demand way higher than supply. Guess I'll go buy an apple TV.
B00A9ET4MC|2.0|Most of our book club did not like the book.  Given the decision again, I would not read the book and I regret that I had to pay money to read something I didn't like.  I thought the author was trying to use a topic &#34;racism&#34; to sell a book.  I found some of her dialogue impossible to believe - the reference to Ifemelu and Curt going to a restaurant in Baltimore and being asked &#34;a table for one&#34;.  Also her presumption on Kimberly's husbands motives &#34;looked people in the eye not because he was interested in them ...&#34;.  First time she met him and had only been in the country a short time, so certainly was not an expert on Americans.  I found the blogs one sided and overly offensive.  When she returned to Nigeria, I note she didn't strongly object to the corruption.  In an interview she said &#34;Still, it seems it is mostly American readers who most miss the fact that “Americanah” is supposed to be funny. I laughed a lot when writing it (although it is a bit worrying to be so amused by one’s own humor). But I suppose race when bluntly dealt with does not blend well with that wonderful, famed American earnestness&#34;.  No-one at our book club found it &#34;funny&#34;.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|I liked seasons 2, 4 and 5 the best.  Some of Season 1 and season 3 were a bit too dark.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Shows interactions to several women's responses to being pregnant.  Movie moves fast, has humor and is enjoyable.<br />Well worth watching.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Going to buy the full version of this game as this is so much fun to play.  Graphics are crisp, colors are vibrant, and music is perfectly suited to the environment. I usually play games from Big Fish but am impressed with this game from the folks at G5 and plan on purchasing more from them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and I have a horse so its a great way for me to train and teach myself how to take care of him
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A higher call is an outstanding 'personal' story of the &#34;other side&#34; of the German story.  The story exposes the lunacy and incompetency of the higher ranking generals (and Hitler) of German military while at the same time demonstrating that the average German non-Nazi was simply a patriot doing his duty to protect his country and its people.  The dedication of these pilots to protecting their country while at the same time despising Hitler and the crazy generals makes for fascinating reading.  When Stigler caught the helpless B-17 but chose to not shoot it down it seemed to me that was the point when he had had enough.  The story of the German Pilot finally meeting with the men who he chose to not kill many years later is emotional for the reader.  This is a great story about the real nightmare of war and at the same time the chivalry that can (and did) exist.  A truly great read for the aficionado of world war 11.  Cal
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is so convenient.  Although I read mostly on my kindle, if I'm out somewhere without it, I can just pick up where I left off by opening this app on my phone!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love puzzles and enjoyed a few familiar ones and many new ones, too.  I recommend this to anyone who likes their games to make them think a little, but not so much it's impossible to finish.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I'm am not usually one to read love stories...unless vampires are involved.  I loved this series.  E.L.James brings an incredible psychological study into her work as her characters evolve into who they were meant to be, not who they were because of the hand they had been dealt earlier in life.  It's just one of the books that you hate to see end...and no! not just 'cuz of the steamy parts!!!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This is a fun and beautiful game to play. It would get 5 stars if it didn't have 2 problems. First, you need pearls for everything, but if you don't buy them with real money, it takes a full week to get 5. And 5 pearls doesn't even buy you one thing. The other problem I have is with the mystery seeds. You spend all your cash and algae to get a special plant (because you don't have pearls to get it) and you don't get anything special. You get a plant you can grow for less than half as much that gives you no benefit whatsoever. It's just frustrating and the game would be so much more fun without these problems.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I'm always amazed when I discover some of these older flicks real hold up.<br />This was one of the first movies I streamed actually - I was quite impressed with the HD quality.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THIS SERIES WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED AND I WISH I WOULD'VE PURCHASED IT SOONER-LOL. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE TERRIBLE MOVIE ADDITION BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK AT ALL. I ENJOYED THE SERIES SO MUCH THAT I BOUGHT THEM FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS GIFTS:)
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Jeffrey Archer never fails to deliver a good story and once again this was an excellent read. Keep them coming please
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Best app ever that I ever downloaded although you should add trip lines and grenades and maybe a no44 with land mines
B008BM9L72|1.0|Would have been a better read with a few less graphic descriptions, the story would have held it's own - the old adage less is more
B00E5SCOS4|3.0|The other reviewers really love this album, mostly due to the lyrical content.<br /><br />I'm not one that really gets into the lyrics - I can appreciate them when they're good, and tolerate them when they're mediocre.  What turns my crank is good melodies and energy, and my online sampling of this album indicated that it's pretty low-key in contrast to her last two albums, which I really liked.<br /><br />Therefore, I'm approaching this one with some degree of caution - before I buy, I'm going to have to listen to more of it in full-length format, perhaps on Youtube or somewhere else.
0345525558|5.0|I read this book because of my book club . I was concerned about the title because I wasn't especially thrilled about learning about the meanings of flowers but once I got into it I realized it is just a small portion if what it's all about and a means for the main character and how she coped with life. It was a quick read and because of the quick chapter it makes for a great book for a busy mom on the run.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Since West Wing went off the air a few years ago, I did not think that TV programs with writing as creative, brilliant, and interesting as this were still being written.  Great character studies, incredibly good acting, and a script with more turns and twists than a mountain road. Don't miss this series!!!
B006VREHRS|5.0|Great period piece with close alliance to historical details. Well acted and excellent cast, beginning with Steve Buscemi. recommended for anyone interested in the roaring 20's and all its dangerous frivolity.
0061452068|5.0|If you want to feel better about the world and how it's going, this is the book for you. Matt Ridley is no Dr. Pangloss. His research about topics like energy, food production, climate change, etc. is deep and wide-ranging, and pretty reassuring. He stands in a long line of anti-doom sayers; he points out time and time again that the doom-sayers' predictions haven't come true and, more importantly, the reasons why.<br />  He's an engaging writer about some very heavy topics. Can't wait for his next book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game. its the perfect cool down for a hectic day. everyone need a little fun in their day and this is it
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I puchased this movie for my husband who is 18+ yrs in the USMC. We saw the movie in the theatre's and really enjoyed it. Excellent detail about the events that led up to the finding/capture/and death of Obama and what the US military went through to make the mission a success. If you're a movie buff, this one is a must own!
B00622B3MY|5.0|My son is two and loves anything to do with Disney or cars, so this movie is the perfect win!
B002ZG97EC|4.0|Great family moive! The yellow minions will make you laugh with their crazy antics, and off the wall (1) word comments. Gru is a bad guy turned good who falls in love with 3 foster girls. DM is a sweet underlining story the whole family will enjoy. My kids ages 8 and 4 will watch this movie over and over and over again. If you love this movie you'll love part 2 in theatre's now. Buy it for your collection!
B008JFUN6E|5.0|An amazing sci fi film, Matt Damon was great, overall a great movie!  A great follow up after district 9
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Really interesting, great cast. I want to see what happens next..  I hope the rest of the seasons get put on amazon prime!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great detail tiles.  Fun to play. Easy on the eyes. Lots of tile choices. Quick download. Perfect on my kindle fire HD.
0763660531|5.0|This book had us from the get-go. My 3 year old loves picking it up and we read it together. Because it's a picture book without text, often he is telling me things about the story that I haven't even noticed. The illustrations are wonderful, the use of light and perspective gives it a very magical feel. It's a great pleasure to read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its amazing just like Subway Surfers!!!!!!! Trust me if you get this you will be amazed!!!!!!GET IT!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a must read for the summer.  Keeps you fully engaged throughout the entire book!  You'll never anticipate the ending.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Jeff Lynne at his best.  Great interpretations of timeless classics.  His voice still has that  unmistakable signature sound. Just wish there were more tracks.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|just uninstalled what used to be a useful app. too much crap on the screen make it hard to find and pull up the...WEATHER. Radar maps slow and jumbled. No obvious or intuitive way to do something simple like delete a location I no longer care about. Shameful destruction of a once good app. Bye bye.
B00CL50KDY|3.0|An alright movie. Low on actually zombie activity. Mainly just a romance movie. I wouldn't recommended it but its not too bad.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a great story about human interaction, and not giving up on your dream. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
0064471837|5.0|I read this wonderful book for the first time when I was eleven years old. I've loved it absolutely ever since. In fact, over the years I have talked a number of friends into reading it, and each and every one of them loved it too. I have been through several copies of Sabriel, simply from how many times I've read it, savored it, and passed it on to be loved by others. The story is fascinating, the world and the magic complex yet familiar, and the heroine is simply fantastic. She is the sort of hero that I love best. The sort that has abilities like magic, but is really just a person who finds themselves in a circumstance where all the hopes for the future are suddenly changed and decided. There's something dire and pressing and there needs to be a hero, and she's it, because frankly there's no one else to do the job. She isn't without fear, she isn't perfect, she makes mistakes, but she keeps going. Sabriel the character is incredible and I love her. The book tells her story, so how could I not love it too?<br /><br />Read this book. Like so many of my other friends who were uncertain or skeptical about it at first, I know you won't be disappointed.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Found it entertaining, but nothing more.  I am fan of all of the actors but the script lacked something.  I like the usual comic relief to break the high tension, but the tension was never that real for me.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Loved Season 7.  As usual, I was totally thrown by the ending and can't wait for Season 8.  A must see for any Dexter fan.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|GREAT MOVIE ENJOY ANYTIME CAN WATCH MANY TIMES AND ITS STILL JUST AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL...LIFE THE MOVIE AND THE LOVE...GET THIS WATCH THIS AND WATCH AGAIN...HAVE A NICE DAY
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I'm afraid I can not eloquently express just why I loved Game of Thrones Season 2.  It's just so well written, well acted, beautiful film editing and photography and the costumes!  I so want some of the gowns.  Plus who doesn't want their own pet dragon, I mean really?
B003DZX3US|5.0|I love this movie so glad to have it on DVD/Blu-Ray after all these years of owning it on VHS.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I really wish I would have seen this film on the big screen in the movie theatres though.  But it is exquisite.  The story was a journey for the spirit and the cinematography a treat for the eyes.
B001EZ2T7W|2.0|Long and tedious.  A TV episode has a limited amount of time : the cheesy deus ex machina events are part of the show's style.  The same plot devices in a movie come across as sloppy writing and poor planning.
B0037QM8YA|3.0|It was an interesting movie and worthwhile to watch. There was no part that I did not like. It portrayed how some people in the ghetto live and their unfortunate situations. At the end Precious was catching up to her age group and really liked learning math.
B006C45MRE|5.0|Good flick! Was a great cast, plot was interesting. Good movie, very entertaining. Price was right.<br />Watched it on Roku easy to set up with Amazon.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The third season is fast paced and very entertaining. Best season yet.  Mr Lincoln and the rest of the cast are also excellent actors
B00634GHJA|5.0|I'm not technically astute what-so-ever and I used this app without any problems the first try. I transferred photos from my PC to my Kindle Fire HD with no effort, with no trouble.<br />I don't understand the negative reviews because it is a great little app, that will be very useful to me from now on.<br />By the way I got this on faotd; what a deal! Thank you!<br />Keep up the good work.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Rented it to prepare to see RED2 at the cinema. Thought there would be more laughs. The actors are good, but I don't think I would watch again, or go to see RED2.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is quite entertaining!!  I've enjoyed trying to top my score each level. Well worth the download. Even my 7 year old enjoys this game.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|The movie is what it is.  The way the scenes were shot reminded me of the Movie Mortal Combat, back in the day.
1609611543|1.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I am a physician, a gastroenterologist, and a clinical researcher.  I have extensive experience in conducting clinical research, and evaluative the quality of the literature (not all scientific publications are of equal strength or rigor).<br /><br />This book is based on the worst sort of pseudo-science and falsehoods that permeates many of the lay-literature on health issues.  It is very persuasively written - I'll give it that.  However the premise of the book is based on the idea that modern wheat is bad for everyone.  The author bases this premise on research and clinical findings in people with celiac disease, not in the general population.  Celiac is an auto-immune condition in which the antibodies affect much more than the gastrointestinal tract.  We know from observational studies of people with gluten sensitivity syndrome (which is not celiac) that these patients do not have the brain, skin, and other extraintestinal manifestations of celiac.  While they are uncomfortable when they get wheat, it's not bad for them per se.<br /><br />The majority of the science presented in this book is anthropologic, agricultural and rodent studies examining the effect of modern wheat.  We are not given any good evidence that wheat causes problems in people today - no observational studies, no clinical trials, nothing...  We are given anecdotal case reports of this cardiologist's patients, without any control for the placebo effect, or the fact that a low-wheat diet likely also means less carbohydrates in general, and a higher protein content.  There's no doubt that the modern North American diet is too high in calories, carbohydrates, and omega-6 fatty acids.  There is no evidence that cutting out wheat fixes this problem.  Cutting out wheat likely means cutting back on carbs, resulting in greater protein intake and generally healthier eating in someone who is concerned about their weight or health.<br /><br />Please approach this book with great caution.  We need far more rigorous science to determine whether wheat is truly harmful in the non-celiac patient, and this book does not give that evidence.  Speak to your doctor, or consult with a weight management specialist (whether physician or registered dietician) instead.  Let's encourage the lay literature to be more evidence-based.book with great caution.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Ok to play, but greedy. Need to spend real money to complete a lot of the missions. My entries into the weekly contests disappeared and customer support ignored my contacts 3 times.
B009MYARIK|5.0|You can't put the book down! It's funny, clever, sad, romantic, all the good qualities you look in a book
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have no issues with the sound quality on these headphones; it handles both high and mid range sounds quite well. Bass is rich and the the cables don't get in the way (DJ's will probably appreciate this the most).<br /><br />That aside, based on the build quality, it's not something that i think will last more than about a year of occasional use and about half that time if it's for daily use.<br /><br />The material on the ear pads peels off very easily leaving residue on your ears and; the ear pads come off the speakers pretty frequently.<br />EDIT 1/5/2016<br />Forget when I originally purchased these headphones but I have had to replace the foam pads twice now. Other than that, it has taken some serious beatings but it still works well.  At $10 to $20 per replacement ear pads, might not really be a worthy investment.<br /><br />A workaround would be to buy custom ear cups to go with it but for the extra bucks, you might as well invest in a slightly more expensive product.<br /><br />Overall rating on a scale of 1 to 5<br />Sound Quality : 4<br />Portability: 5<br />Durability: 2
B001NA6096|5.0|If you appreciate the art of conversation, and find enjoyment in observing others converse, then you will likely love this movie about two carefree individuals who meet on a trip in Europe and have an unforgettable evening in Vienna.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Wanted to read it before I saw the movie.  I am very glad I did.  This is a well written book.  I was sad it ended because I couldn't put it down.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It's a way better, cooler version of temple run!!!! It's more challenger as well as entertaining! It's a good purchase. Plus the visuals are super vivid and colorful!
B009OA57MI|4.0|It's pretty cool but very tough. Maby to real. The jet flight is great. Makes you feel like a real pilot.
B009GCF3Q4|5.0|Did not let me down - he is good value and I never miss any of his books the best being &#34;The Poet&#34;
0525952616|5.0|Daniel Suarez is in my mind clearly the best techno-thriller writer of the day.  All his books are both great stories and technically sound.
B00E193Y36|4.0|I've listened to this band since their demo album.  &#34;War Is The Answer&#34; is definitely still my favorite.  This new album has a couple good tracks on it, and the last 2/3 of it is just live versions of a few songs of their previous albums.  I feel like they are traveling down a darker path with some of their lyrics in the newer songs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting. I am 17 and I love despicable minions. this game is awesome. Although it crashes sometimes on the kindle fire. But still worth the download! !!!!!!!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Just got the program and have not had the time to explore it. Use excel alot before I retired and this looks like it has great potential
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Have been watching this program almost since it started on the air in the US, and later overseas. Episodes vary, but all-in-all each broadcast/recording is entertaining. What more can you ask?
0425252868|5.0|I found it a honest story of those who lived thru this time in history.  Should be mandated for high school reading.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I had to import my files from splash id. A bit hard to initially figure out with the free dedktop program. Customer service responded to my question within 24 hours. This was no cookie cutter response but an actual detsiled reply! Their solution worked great. So far no crashes unlike the last app I switched from. Now if the full desktop version could be sold at a reduced price to people who have purchased the app I would give msecure 6*!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Basic, better on kindle fire than on the android, less glitches that I have found. The feeding part works better than on the droid n much less confusing<br />Sweetpea_kristi@yahoo
B005544V6A|5.0|Best Written Show Ever, Funny, Smart, Sexy and Multi-layered, great characters, great character development. It's my favorite show probably ever.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|There are books you read and forget, and then there are those that stay with you and become friends. I suspect this one will fall into the latter category for me. The characters, images, and ideas woven together by Gaiman are incredibly rich and satisfying. There is magic in this man's writing.
1885167776|5.0|This book can pertain to any aspect of your life....it was a very easy read and added insight to a new way of thinking.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I love Dr. Seuss and Jim Carrey.  It was great to be able to purchase this at a great price and have it delivered to my house.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very cool, stylish, funny, dynamic, great watch if you are looking for a show to get into if you are looking.
B00004YRQA|5.0|A very good buy coz it's cheap and works well with our PS2. I am recommending this product to all buyers.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|A great, fun, interesting, &#34;clean&#34; book that is well written, as one would expect from John Grisham.  A modern Nancy Drew.
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|NOTE:  This is not a negative review of the app, itself. I actually like the app.<br /><br />Tonite I discovered that any app licensed by / sold through the Amazon App store requires that you have to be logged on to Amazon to use it. This, I suppose, is fine if you have a tablet with 3G or 4G. For those like me...that have to have a wi-fi connection or be near a hot spot to go online ... this is an unacceptable restriction. I have at least 2 or 3 critical work apps that I must access, even if I am out of range of wi-fi or hot spot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The levels keep it fresh and sorry but soooo cute!  My sons - 5 & 9 can't put it down and are saving up coins to buy new minions.  They play it on my S4 and not too bad battery drain.  Wish you could just &#34;Play Again&#34; without the 5 sec reload, but you can use coins to skip that step.  Great graphics and free - we're going to put it on our Kindle Fire next as it's hard to share :-)
0785153942|5.0|I haven't read the entire comic yet, I'm taking my time to savor it.<br />I browsed through it and found satisfying spreads of monster verse machine action. :)
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My sons 5 & 9 really like it, especially how you can customize your ride with colors and graphics - very cool.  Music isn't too annoying for this type of game and the course selection once you complete a level expands to other good environments (graphics) and difficulty.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Tested on a USB-based data collection system using two of these in tandem for a total of 20 meters distance. They worked perfectly. The connector are adequate and the cable is flexible, no complaints.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It is fun for the first day then gets very boring. Only get this game if you are under 10 years old.
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|Sudoku 4ever Plus (which was the FAOTD a few weeks ago) is far superior to this version.<br /><br />This doesn't highlight the numbers until you put one in (like someone already mentioned), game play is not self explanatory like most other Sudoku games (I couldn't figure out how to erase a number mistakingly entered), and it doesn't save (I hit the back arrow thinking it was &quot;undo&quot; but instead it backed me out of the game. I tried to go back to my game in progress and it was a new game).<br /><br />Uninstalled after 5 minutes.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Game is organized, fun, and a long campaign. Multiplayer is fun too. Took me a bit to get used to the format.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Bought these for my brother to take to Afghanistan and surprisingly they made it back. Planning on buying more for his next deployment
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game Is so fun!!! Get it now it's the best game ever get it now get it now!!! I beg you if you get it you'll know what I mean this is so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|PM Pirates is lively and engaging. It is impossible to stay away - there is so much to get done!  Very entertaining and quite fun..
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Game is visually stunning, combined with a great plot.  This game is very addictive, you will spend hours playing this game!
B005URRCNQ|5.0|Great item, the album is excellent and the packaging perfect for any vinyl. Also includes CD for digital which is great
B008ED6P86|1.0|This band was my religion and my law for years.  That began to decline when I started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and DVD's as well as very disappointing albums.  I believed THUNDER IN THE SKY could have been a turning point but then the BATTLE HYMNS rehash happened.  Now this...<br /><br />Eric Adams doesn't sing lyrics, it sounds like he is saying them. He is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in Metal. Hamzig's drumming is fine.  It's nice to hear him perform something other than BH songs.<br /><br />I never thought I would say this but Karl Logan's guitar work doesn't bother me on this album.  It's simple and gets the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually does.  Dare I say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling?  One of the few strong points of this album.  It pains me to say that since he was a jerk when I met him.<br /><br />Ok time to hurt someone's feelings...DeMaio's bass sounds like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the notes.  It's pretty bad and annoying.  Every song it sounds the same.  I am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demands an explanation.  Is this his attempt at dub step?  It certainly isn't the true metal sound.<br /><br />The overall production reminds me of Electronic Dance Music where they switch channels for an \\"interesting\\" speaker or headphone experience.  One thing EDM has that this album doesn't is heavy bass.  Seriously... if you are going to attempt doom metal (Black List)...you need that deep bass...sorry.  Put away the picolo bass if you wanted to \\"evolve\\".<br /><br />Not so many songs about Vikings (which should be left to AMON AMARTH) and it KIND OF reminds me of SIGN OF THE HAMMER album lyrics (I can never forgive \\"all men and small boys\\" and if someone could explain \\"Bigfoot Bigfoot caught in a well\\"....please).  SOTH is an awesome album and this isn't.  At times they remind me of Dr. Suess rhymes (which of course is what rap music is like).  The only standard Manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a Harley.  Maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnets used to construct the lyrics of this album?<br /><br />Let's take a look at each song:<br /><br />THE LORD OF STEEL: starts off like a Dr. Suess rhyme but has musical moments.  Lazy lyric writing.  Poor opening song to an album.<br /><br />MANOWARRIORS: again has musical moments but we heard these lyrics before.  Another disappointment.  I expected a good anthem like WARRIORS OF THE WORLD.  Nope.<br /><br />BORN IN A GRAVE: finally some lyrics and music that are different, not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruins it.  At this point I ask, \\"why isn't Eric singing?\\"<br /><br />RIGHTEOUS GLORY: First mention of Odin on the album.  It would have been nice to use Eric's vocals better on this one.  He can sing so let him.  I wonder if he was sick the day they recorded this album?<br /><br />TOUCH THE SKY:  The bass is ridiculous on this song.  It's like an incessant hum of tones and that's a shame because this is one of the better songs on the album.  Like I mentioned, DeMaio's bass playing demands an explanation.<br /><br />BLACK LIST:  Attempt at Doom Metal that falls flat.  Humming bass that sounds like EDM.  Drumming could have been heavier as well.  Lyrics aren't good and vocals sound \\"pro-tooled\\".  This song could have been very good.<br /><br />EXPENDABLE: a pathetic, sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money.  This is the type of song that requires a 80's movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyrics that Eric simply recites.  An incredible loss of power in his voice.  Did something happen to his voice that I don't know about?<br /><br />EL GRINGO:  This is a silly song that sounds like a TACO BELL commercial.  Head for the border.<br /><br />ANNIHILATION: Dr. Suess rhymes.  1980's Atari ACTIVISION video game sounding bass.  Pro-tooled vocals.  Disgraceful.<br /><br />HAIL KILL AND DIE: now that they have hailed and killed for years it's time to die. Duly noted.  Channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album titles and arrange them in a paragraph.  The chorus sounds like Frat boys attempting to be tough guys at a metal show where they are clearly out of place. Really douche chill inducing.<br /><br />THE KINGDOM OF STEEL: a boring lullaby that sounds like something KAMELOT could cover and would do a much better job.<br /><br />Even if I wasn't a former fan this is a crap metal album in general.  I hate I didn't download it for free before purchasing it.  This is more of a novelty act like STEEL PANTHER and there are better bands in the \\"true metal\\" genre.  I'm sure their European live shows are amazing but DeMaio really needs to take a step back with the studio albums.  Anytime a band creates it's own studio the music suffers.<br /><br />Much like METALLICA has sucked since Cliff Burton died, this band is not the same since ROSS THE BOSS.  I have a feeling he kept DeMaio's ego in line until he couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />Technology has ruined this band.  They used to be proud of plugging in and just playing.  That formula still works and I wish DeMaio would remember those times.  I REALLY want to love this band again.  He needs put aside the \\"FTW I'll do what I want\\" attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing, blah blah blah...but you can't argue with crazy.  Some people believe the Earth is flat and they will never be convinced.  Maybe in 20 years he will remake this album too?
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, which surprised me, because I am personally not a big fan of Tom Cruise. That note aside, it is a very striking movie! Visually it is very captivating, and I ended up watching nearly 1/3 of the movie with just the M83 soundtrack enabled (off the Blu-Ray version) and no dialogue. Kosinski has produced a very believable environment and story. In the extra features Joseph Kosinski says something to the effect of, 'Science-Fiction has been pulled into the dark, I wanted to bring it back into the light again.' in reference to the feeling/setting of the movies. I think this is why I enjoyed it so much more than I expected too. It had a brighter, futuristic feel to it. It wasn't dripping wet with unnecessary action and explosions just to keep it going. If you're even thinking about watching this movie and are unsure, I highly suggest you at least rent it, otherwise you'll be missing out.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I am a puzzle fan and doing the simple math keeps your mind active.  Good graphics, easy interface.  My only complaint would be that it plays in portrait mode only, it would be nice if it would do landscape.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|An inspirational story about a boy with exceptional ability in the area of chess.  The story is so inspiring because the boy's family encourages the kind heart of the boy while still allowing him to be so highly competitive.  Wonderful!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like that it displays a time left on battery.  I have an ASUS TF700 and certain apps can drain the battery so it's nice to have an approximate time of battery life left rather than a percentage.
B0064O927I|2.0|My main motive purchasing this watch was because it is advertised to have a sapphire crystal glass.<br />Be aware that this is not the case. As a matter of fact, it is not even a mineral glass but rather a cheap hard plastic.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|did not like the choice of noise.. that was the problem in that it was noise to me as opposed to sounds.
B0053O89RY|4.0|Very funny! I have seen all the seasons and have been very pleased. i just wish this season had more episodes (24 total).
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app allows me to tap into my laptop and stream flash videos.  Very easy setup, very user friendly, it opens up many more options for tablet use.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Lots of fun if you are familiar with any style of card gaming.  Could use more rules information but still very addictive. Good game.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|good read.  kept things moving.  I have read several of the Reacher books, and really like them.  would expect to read them all.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|Typical freebie.  Sounds terrible and a little slow in response time.  Not worth paying for the extras hoping it will sound better.  Hoped it would be more entertaining.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|Smooth, clear operation for reading, and quite nice for adding/editing annotations.<br /><br />Suggestion: add the ability to have a &#34;home&#34; folder of the users choice and location.  I like to store pdf's on my microsd card, and would like an easier way to navigate to it from within Repligo
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This game seemed to have quite a learning curve.  Great challenge for an older adult who enjoys figuring things out.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I love this activity tracker. My husband has been using the FitBit Flex, but I don't like that it doesn't have a display and it didn't do the heart rate monitoring. The Pulse seems to be very accurate on step count, fits easily in my pocket, is easy to use with the belt clip accessory, and I have yet to use the sleep band. The one feature that I wish it had was an alarm that you could set through the app. The FitBit Flex has the vibrating alarm that wakes you up which I think would be a nice addition to the Pulse. Overall, I like the ease of set up and use, the convenience of having a display on the device, and the great app interface.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like the various silly puzzles.  Keeps my eyes and brain working.  I wasn't sure how it would play on a small tablet but have found it quite fun to play.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I really felt this was a waste of time.  Cared not at all for any of the characters, especially Phoenix's.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|Strictly for the very young.  If I had a very young child in the house who was easily entertained and had a long attention span, it might be worth the carousel space.
B008J34466|3.0|I heard Pink's sensored versions on the radio and loved the songs then.<br />This CD is NOT sensored and I found quickly not appropriate for background music at a school function nor in my car.<br />Would return if I could.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I was able to fly and land the aircraft within a relatively short period of time but found that I lost interest quickly.
B00E8B1358|5.0|nice movie; just enjoy the ride and don't do any thinking; Plenty of action and the snake eyes had some really great action scenes;
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Like the title says, it was alright. It had it's thrilling moments that were amazing but I found the book almost boring most of the time. The first book was definitely more interesting but with the second it failed short. Debating whether or not to even purchase the third series now.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|a really really great movie; totally deserved more awards than it received; Christoph Waltz stole every scene he was in and Samuel L Jackson was awesome as the villain; i had to add this one to my collection;
B009C7JS14|2.0|Like if it's almost done downloading  it'll  pause right in the middle of the downloading and then you have to go back out of it and hit the download button again
B004SEUJX2|5.0|This is one film, with all it's gorgeous Conrad L. Hall cinematography, that deserves a much better release than this BD. This is not much better than video quality. If the current trend is creating quality Blu-Rays from a 4K scan, then I would like to nominate this film for the upgrade. Upgrade the extra's as well. I saw a history channel investigation that claims Butch Cassidy survived the Bolivia shoot out and made it back to the U.S. where his sister spoke with him. The Director, George Roy Hill, claims thats why he didn't show the outlaws get gunned down in the film. - add that... Oh, and lets get on that right a way.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|I kept getting error message, where I was streaming too many movies to my device.  I rebooted, tried the next day.  Same thing.  I watched it on Comcast on demand.<br />Movie itself was excellent 4 stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is great for the kindle fire, I play it all the time on long flights.  Easy to read, too many advertisements but quick to play.
1451627297|3.0|I used to read Stephen King books in one sitting, no matter how long they were.  It's been years since I was tempted to read a King book, but I am interested in Kennedy so I bought this one.  It just didn't hold my interest.  I read the first 100 pages or so, but have not picked it back up.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game was very addicting and a bit challenging but I lived each and every puzzle.  Would recommend this app for anyone who loves puzzles and search and find games.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Very well done. Great story line, great energy, good start, good finish and excellent twist that pulls it all together.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|I've been into her music, every since I heard her on Incognito... Maysa has a signature to her music that only she can do best.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed how unique this book was! Though maybe a little dark natured, I really liked the creativity behind all the characters and use of old photographs! Some reviews said the pics were hard to see... I use the Amazon App on my phone and when you hold down on the pic, an option to \\"zoom in\\" pops up for a much better and closer look!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Allot of action but still just so so.  The acting was eh.  Overall it was still entertaining.  Recommend just for blow em up kind of deal.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Fast paced and what I expected in a movie with good acting and and cinematography. I liked it. It was well done.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this movie.  Rogen is sometimes to vulgar for my taste but it was quite charming, witty and funny.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this book and liked the constant flow that it has. Something is constantly happening and keeps u wanting to read. Maybe would have liked to change the end a bit but I am hoping the rest of the books helps that. Overall very good
B0011Z8SHK|5.0|&#34;Smoke on the Water&#34;. What else needs to be said? One of the best classic rock songs ever. Yet I don't think this is the best song on the album. That would be a toss-up between &#34;Highway Star&#34; and &#34; Space Truckin' &#34; ( I even named my first cars after these songs). We tried playing &#34;Space Truckin' &#34; once in a garage band I used to be in, and from that experience, we got a whole new respect for the talent of Deep Purple that made this LP. All of the songs are classics, and meant to be played loud, preferably while cruising down the highway. Originally I had the 8-Track of this album, and I though it sounded great, even in that format, but I recently got the MP3 version, and it sounds even better. My favorite Deep Purple MKII album, and one of my all time favorites.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Not bad at all.  but not even close to realistic in premise.  Still, it's a sci-fi and worth a watch.
B0064MGU98|5.0|smart and compelling drama - I always heard it was good, glad I finally tuned it to see for myself!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We just started watching &#34;The Good Wife&#34; a few weeks ago and have now made it through the first two season. The show is very well written and we can't wait after every episode to get to the next.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I thought it was an interesting book with a very creative plot, but, it got a bit far fetched and contrite towards the end.  Enjoyable none the less.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. I have read all of his books. He will be missed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun but at the same time it can be frustrating. Im learning also very addicting too.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I just thought how devastating this would be to happen to someone and be involved in such a tragedy. Easy and capturing read.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|If you throw out trying to consider the movie scientifically possible, then it's a really great movie. Strong characters. A sense of awe. Insanity. Lonely heroism. Trippy graphics
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved this trilogy. Very capturing and thrilling books. I cannot wait for the all the movies. I have recommended these to friends and would definitely read them again.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|this is a story of when Sam Raimi completely gave up trying to make horror and learned how to capitalize on his own farts.
B001B51B9M|5.0|The only musical I like and dvd is great.  Flashback to much simpler times as a little guy whose parents took me to musicals.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great brain game!  Love how it starts out so simple but works up to being much more thought provoking.  Could easily be mistaken for a child's game, but get to the 8x8 or 10x10 level and it's not childish anymore!  Fantastic way to stimulate the mind and keep the creativity flowing.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|has a few problems with a very small window of touch.  big fingers are a problem.  it is a challenge and keeps the mind working.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|The movie was a fine action movie, but Amazon's streaming delivery of this movie in SD format was the worst I have experienced in years.  It came in blocky, stuttering, skipping and several times there were pauses in the streaming.  I have not had these issues with movies rented from iTunes, Netflix or Hulu in the past three years.  Amazon needs to work in their streaming video delivery.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Great story about Jay Moriarity and Santa Cruz.  Have watched it many times and shared with others.  Well worth watching!
B0072OFM28|5.0|I am a fan of ancient history and I loved this series.  Lots of action and politics.  It shows how important reputation is in the SQPR.<br />Also the protagonist is portrayed with above average intelligence, not just brute force.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I like Baldacci. I will pick up one of his at the airport any time. Simple read and diverting. Ok.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Unfortunately I've only read some of the novels.  I like the adaptation to the big screen.  Just too many different characters for me to keep track of.
B00A27X972|4.0|I enjoyed this book, creative and interesting, and made insightful points about how human beings act when viewed from an outside perspective. It kept my attention, and I liked the alien aspect.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|enjoyed this game challenging but solvable. would recommend this game to others. wish more puzzle games were like this one
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This was a powerful movie.  Not like movies of it's kind from the past that were so sanitized.  Shows the way Christ died in detail and the cruelty of his suffering.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This app is a very confusing app. Everyone is playing Candy Crush. Please give us an app for Kindle Fire.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I like exploration games but don't particularly care for hidden objects.  Unfortunately most exploration games are mostly hidden objects.  This had more and was easy to click through the hidden object screens without really looking for items
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Shinedown until the release of Second Chance.  I really liked the single but never heard anything else by them played on the radio so I never gave them a second thought.  My friend accidentally ordered two copies of this CD and gave me one.  I was hooked instantly.  This is a CD that will return to your CD player often.
B0036MDNN0|5.0|Grandson did not have this dinosaur and was curious to find out about it.  small horns are well crafted. wow!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was so beautifully written...each scene flowed seamlessly to the next.  I would let my 13 year old read it! Timeless.
B0073RBQY2|5.0|Found out this was a flying reptile at a dinosaur puppet show for children.  Never too old to learn something new.  Coloring is great.
B005HGKWLO|4.0|Movie was good. It paused when it was getting to the best part though, that was bad! Overall good movie to watch with your girlfriends.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Hate shopping in stores for batteries as they are usually hanging in odd places.  The price was great and it saved a lot of driving from place to place only to have them sold out.
0425263916|5.0|Loved it! Just like 50 Shades... A little better written i think. The only thing is I wished I knew there were 4 books in this series I hate waiting lol. I read the first 3 in a week I couldn't put them down but know I have to wait to see what happens. If you liked 50 you'll love this series
B009GX69RK|5.0|Love this season! Hilarious and witty, New Girl is so worth watching! I highly recommend it! Enjoy Enjoy Enjoy! Enjoy!

B00BWWS81S|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I think KT is a GREAT musician, vocalist & songwriter. One of the most talented around today. I love \\"Eye to the Telescope\\", \\"Drastic Fantastic\\" & \\"Acoustic Extravaganza\\". Her last release, \\"Tiger Suit\\", was OK but I thought she may have been losing her way a bit. Now, after a couple years off from recording, she comes out with this almost totally acoustic, ultra mellow album. Like one of the previous reviewers, I miss KT's catchy, up-tempo melodies, which are non-existent on this release. I purchased this as an import last month because I was going through \\"KT Tunstall withdrawal\\" and couldn't wait for the U.S. release. I'll give it a few more listens, especially since the vast majority of other reviewers seem to really like this approach. It comes down to personal taste. Her voice & playing is superb as always, but I like my KT on the more energetic side.

B004MPI5SS|4.0|Based on the trailer, we decided to give this one a shot and were glad we did.  This girl goes through hell and then dishes it out in some of gnarliest scenes that will make you cringe!
0618001905|5.0|I had to read this book for my college history class (I'm a history major) and it's fantastic. I plan on reading it again soon. Not only is it informative and historically accurate, but it's moving as well. I won't lie, I cried when I finished it. I'd recommend it, even if you're just looking for a good read.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Relaxing, short. Would have liked a bit more challenging puzzles.  Nevertheless, setting my own time limits helped me to enjoy the game and challenge.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game kills load of time while having so much fun!  I have downloaded more games from the Amazon appstore than the Play Store!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book to read and see what all the hype was about! It wasn't what I expected! I couldn't put it down. It was exhilarating.
0439023521|4.0|I bought this shortly after watching the film and for once the book and film actually met each other in terms of imaginative quality. The book does offer a greater insight into the lives of each character, and some scenes are a bit more gruesome than those of the age restricted film, but all in all, if your a fan of the film I would definitely recommend this as a fun and interesting read!
B00B1RB942|4.0|I love the movie but the packaging was very cheaply made and flimsy. The DVD was perfect and the quality was great. I think that the only bad thing was the packaging. But I am happy with my purchase! The price was reasonable and the quality of the DVD was like any other Blu-ray! I would recommend it!
B0027MJU00|3.0|Love me some gilian flynn but this was a little too unsettling for me.i normally cant put her stuff down but found myself having to take a break
B004CRR9G0|5.0|I love this movie and the packaging was perfect as well as the quality of the picture. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and I believe it waa a great purchase!
B001J1PT82|5.0|Very funny dark comedy/ vampire spoof.  Roman Polanski and the late beautiful Sharon Tate.  Awesome movie!  I love this film!
B006FTCGXY|5.0|Very well written and directed to be suspenseful for an Indy. Brit Marling helped write and star in it and she inspired me in this film to see her other film and has a new one coming out this Fall. She plays a wide range of characters and is very smart and beautiful. Big future
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House tells many stories of life in the late 1700s/early 1800s in the South.  The characters are very well developed and so relatable. Even though this story is fiction, you feel as if you are reading history.  I highly recommend!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such a great show! The characters suck you in! I can't wait for the next season! I wish we didn't have to wait so long!
0894803123|5.0|Love this book. I bought it along with the cuisinart ice cream maker and I've Braden enjoying it ever since. I have.t bought ice cream since purchasing it.
B006Z00R1Q|4.0|This third Paranormal is a prequel that occasionally goes off the rails but also offers more laughs and somewhat more character development than the previous installments. This may be the most ambitious Paranormal, and while it's not the most frightening, it's the kind of Halloween scare-fest enhanced by a jittery audience in a packed theater.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|I loved this unexpected gem from the very start to the very end.  All the actors were just awesome, Mathew Mcconaughey Sam Shepard, Reese, just all of them added their own ingredient to fine fare of a movie, was well worth it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've read this series several times.  I consider this series to be soft erotica and enjoyable as such.  What bothers me is that the setting is in the U.S. and no one, not the author, copy editor, proof reader, no one...  bothered to revise the 'England'  english to 'American' english.<br /><br />It's a bit disconcerting to read something that is supposed to be taking place in areas or locations you are familiar with and having characters who are speaking in a way that is not consistant with those areas and locations.<br /><br />Words and phrases like 'hiding' (whipping), 'sorted', 'too right' just are not said by Americans.  If you can get past this flaw and a few minor spelling errors, Fifty Shades of Grey is an enjoyable start to the series.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Was a pretty good love story. I like more steamy bedroom scenes, but the story line was catchy. I would have liked the ending to have been the birth of their first child.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I made an impulse buy, even if I could get the device to connect, it appears to have no function that I do not have already have covered on my roku, blueray or smart tv. The tech support is a bunch of untrained newbies who could at least be polite and helpful but are short and rude. It was only $35 but quite frankly useless. I have never returned anything to Amazon, but there is always a first time, and the Chromecast is it. As recently is the case with Google, way too little, way to late.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I watched this with my daughter.  Had no expectations, but found that I was captivated by this charming movie.  I loved it.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I always wanted to avoid this movie because it was all anybody talked about and I didn't want to get dragged into a new obsession. One day however, while I was browsing through redbox, I finally decided to give it a shot.<br />I am SO happy that I did. I felt so many emotions in this movie and also related in so many little ways. Instantly my favorite movie of all time. I just had to own my own special copy.
B000P6L3KU|3.0|WAITING FOR THE SUN might be evidence that Jim Morrison was either a tapped-out lyric writer (\\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" and \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\") or just totally stoned out of his mind (\\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" poetry). But then, we see flashes of the sort of brilliance that permeated the DOORS' first two albums-- tracks like \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" and \\"Five To One\\" stand up against any that this band ever recorded.<br /><br />Musically, WAITING FOR THE SUN often sounds tremendously dated-- perhaps it was outmoded even in 1968. Fuzz guitar and calliope-like organ are everywhere-- there's waltzes (\\"Wintertime Love\\") and schmaltzes (\\"Love Street\\") and all sorts of filler. A pattern of inconsistency established here followed the group right through to L.A. WOMAN. The DOORS were a band that the \\"Best Of\\" compilation was ideal for. Like [[ASIN:B000M4PPM2 THE SOFT PARADE]] and [[ASIN:B000K380NG MORRISON HOTEL]], WAITING FOR THE SUN is only for their most devoted fans and perhaps '60s rock completists.<br /><br />SIDE ONE:<br />[2:14] Hello, I Love You<br />[2:53] Love Street<br />[3:56] Not to Touch the Earth<br />[3:22] Summer's Almost Gone<br />[1:54] Wintertime Love<br />[3:25] The Unknown Soldier<br /><br />SIDE TWO:<br />[3:03] Spanish Caravan<br />[3:01] My Wild Love<br />[2:26] We Could Be So Good Together<br />[2:36] Yes, the River Knows<br />[4:26] Five to One<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 33:08
B000VX040M|5.0|Bought these shoes for $40.00 less than the local Timberland store. They are exactly what I was looking for, and will suit the use I have intended for them (rugged casual)
B0091WAWTM|1.0|We selected this because it had good ratings....bad choice. Lots of nudity, and not pot to the story. After 20mis and seeing some ridiculous scenes we turned it off. Don't waste your time.
B00634GHJA|1.0|This app looked good at first, but when you hit get from another device, it gives you the option of epson WF-2450 series and that's all. Well, at least that is what happened to me. I tried this app out on my nexus 7, and if this happens to you, this app is pointless.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|If you liked The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel then definately rent this! If you didn't...don't. Great flick for a feel good time!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Who doesn't love Miracle on 34th Street!!  It has a wonderful cast and a lovey story line.  Edmund Gwenn was indeed Santa.  This is a movie for all ages.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|really kept my interest and the graphic are great.  the only draw back is it draws you in and then ends.
B00062PN6I|2.0|We purchased 30 pair of these headphones for a project at work. We went with these because they can be easily re-used where as the other option (earbuds) wouldn't have worked. I was impressed to find that the cable length was about 6 feet long. The cable connects only to one ear, which is how all real professional headphones are wired. This pair also includes a 3.55mm (\\"mini jack\\") to 1/4\\" adaptor, and it's threaded so it can screw and lock onto the jack rather than just snapping in. This is a feature usually reserved for expensive studio phones.<br /><br />The physical quality of the headphones is decent, especially for the price. The cable is thick, the padding is fairly comfortable, and the headphones are sturdy considering they are cheap plastic. Out of the 30 pair we purchased, only 1 pair arrived with a broken driver, resulting in 1 side not-working. After reading some reviews of shipments coming DOA, I was worried, but it was better than what I expected.<br /><br />Now for the audio quality: They suck. There is no real low-end, the low mid is boosted, and the high-mids are muffled. These headphones sound horrible, and I've listened through a few dozen pair, from cheap headphones to $300 studio reference headphones. If you're looking for a cheap pair that actually sound good, look into the $20 range for Sennheiser. If you're on a tight budget, there are a pair of Panasonic earbuds which sound MUCH better than these headphones and they sell on Amazon for $6. Get those instead.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|The most approachable of Hitchcock thriller with a most memorable line, &#34;Oh Roger, just pay the ticket.&#34; Momma's boy and bad boy Roger O. Thornhill with his classic matches marked with R.O.T. is priceless.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|everyone seems to have high regards and appreciation of this movie, and so have i. Robert Downey is perfect in the role, so is Gwyneth Paltrow in hers. and of course all the suits and the comedy... really a field day for all iron man fans... what more to be said? except for non-fans.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book tore at my heart strings.  I liked the way the book blended past with present.  The only difficulty I had was understanding the way people in Ireland speak.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Hopefully there will be several more seasons.  The Elementary Team is great together. The Watson/Holmes combination is superb.  I can't watch just one episode. I have to see what happens next in the character development.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this as well as myself! Great graphics, and I like how it is so closely relatable to the movie.
B002CPMB9O|5.0|Denzel is a beast! This has got to be one of the greatest movies he has done! I could watch this movie once a week if I was so inclined to do so.
B00CUWKHVI|4.0|I really like this album! I think it is beautiful music which has class and grace in it. There is a couple of songs like, &#34;when I get famous, at the edge of s/th, and save your soul&#34; that I especially adore! I am a fan, Jamie :)
B000IONJJ2|3.0|Not sure what to say about this movie... It really did not meet my expectations for a comedy. It was far too corny and I found the humor to be somewhat childish. I thought it would be a winner with John Cleese, however he's done much better work.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Perfect for your young teenager.  Coming of age movie for the younger set.  Great gift, as it will put you on the insider track.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|This show brings back so many good memories! Love that it is on prime, but just wish they had more than the 1st season!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love this application I'm loving it very long thinking game I play it for a very long time the family can play it together
B00E193TM2|5.0|This album has some great pump you up music in it. I like to listen to it while I work out at the gym or when my boss makes me do stupid S!#$ :D If you are a fan of 5FDP other albums you will really enjoy this one. It also has about 4 slower songs which even my wife enjoys.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Rob and the guys sound incredible still. Sorry I missed the last tour but I was lucky enough to see them live 4 times over the years and they never disappoint.The only negative I have is the editing.If the director could have held a shot for longer than 3 seconds it would have been more enjoyable. Other than that Rob was very energetic and sounded fantastic.Wish I could hunt down the Legacy T-shirt that was sold on the tour.PRIEST LIVES!!!!!
B008Y73XTQ|2.0|As a former submariner, I find that the scenarios presented in this version  of the film are simply dramatic scare scenes. Going beyond test depth so many times and using up their stored air before they ended up on the bottom at 660 meters was simply ridiculous. Yeah and then they were able to blow main ballast tanks. Oh, and before that bridge bad batteries flooded in salt water that they could not possibly pump out of the battery compartment and have the alkaline to neutralize the acid, Yeah, right. BS, BS, BS. Who consulted on this project anyway?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a must get app .It is fun and it is not a waste of time.If you are a gamer this is the app for you !:):) GO SUBWAY SURFERS !!!!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I am a huge sifi fan and had been longing for a good show that isn't a waste of time.  Falling Skies has a great cast and the writers make me think I know what is about to happen, only to discover there is another twist in the action.  Highly recommend!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love this glimpse into how he estates used to me managed and how the staff look at their employers.  I don't think there is anything I don't like about this show and love that I can watch it free through my Amazon Prime account!  Thanks for including this in the Prime package.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game really got me hooked. Only thing I don't like is when u don't have a guess and are out of coins to buy hints you can't see what the answer is. Other than that an overall great game.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Read the book for my book club.  Found it very interesting but would have liked more chapter headings.  If I lost my place it was difficult to find the point where I left off.  I also had trouble shifting perspectives between the two section as the primary character through whom the story is told shifted.  It was a great insight into the thinking of the people who live under a supremely oppressive regime.  It was a fast read but not an easy one.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|An engaging story of a young love that weathers time and finds a second chance amid the turmoil of political intrigue and personal interests of those in high office.  This movie combines the suspense of a mystery with the emotion of a love story to yield a compelling story line that keeps you hoping for the best, but wondering if it can all work out.  Well worth the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is just like temple run except better with no crashes ever!!!!!!! Get it and if you like temple run you'll like this better!!
B004XQO90O|4.0|Plenty of suspenseful action to keep you engaged in this exciting plot of altered identity.  Makes you wish stuff like this could really happen, especially for the type of people portrayed in this guy-meets-girl change of pace flick.  If you like to see the good guys struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds, with the outcome never a foregone conclusion, this is the movie for you.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Hard to say this was his best work. So much had happened in his personal life that it is hard to divide the two up during these sessions. Having said that the out takes show what he could have been during these session, the songs he sings before he sings what is expected of him. Yet there is so many good songs he recorded, but at the time he was in no mans land, not country like country was but what country would become, mature, and no longer wanting to be a hard rocker, yet in promise land and a few others he could turn it on a drop of the dime. Really incredible, most of all what he needed was people around him who would take his best interest to heart which was never the case sad to say. He was and still is a money making machine, but this should not take from him that voice, and feel that he had until the end of his life, that voice for the most part never failed him. Some tracks he really seemed depressed, and no energy nor happiness'. Hard to believe just 4 years earlier how happy and energized he was. Like I like to say when he was good he was very good, this set is worth the cost because these session are about the last time he tried to make good music, instead of being forced to, like the recording made at Graceland. As far as the cover goes it looks good to me, he was fly dresser, and well this is Elvis being Elvis.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Reminds me of Winston Churchill's description of WWII Soviet Union's foreign policy as &#34;a puzzle inside a riddle wrapped in an enigma&#34;!  Intriguing use of mind-game possibilities that quickly leads you into an altered state of mental awareness, and perpetual guessing as to what level of reality you are in.  If you like movies that keep you wondering, and take you outside-the-box of conventional thinking, this is the movie for you!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Keeps you turning pages as you try to figure why the silo as well as the name of the novel.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|&#34;Best laid plans gone awry&#34; is the general story line of this suspenseful, fast-paced mental twister of a man who gets rerouted by an unforeseen accident that results in temporary amnesia that opens the door to a whole new series of outcomes.  The plot is compelling but not complicated, engaging but not tedious.  Will this guy ever figure out who he really is?!?
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|This movie is just phenomenal - great story, great twist, and one of the few movies that's ever really scared me past the credits. The fact that it's a classic is just a bonus. Highly recommended!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it is a great game. it lags a little bit but its ok.so over all not a had game.that's why I give it four stars.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|As a child I loved the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. As an adult I was excited to see how this movie was going to pull off bringing that story to life. On that end they did not disappoint. The visual effects are great, the movie itself overall, not so much. Nicholas Hoult was great, the giants are truly scary but as far as the rest of the cast it was a lot of over-acting with no real affect.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|Apparently this Cavil guy who makes a very weak attempt at portraying Superman (he's NO Chris Reeve) is dating former Cage Fighter turned wannabe action movie star Gina Carano. Who is btw extremely attractive with a VERY well endowed Chest. I'd rather stare at that for a couple of hrs. than sit through this dog piss of a movie. Go rent either of the 1st two Superman movies w/Chris Reeve instead of this abomination!
B00CWV8X04|5.0|This movie was really great. Besides, starring some of my favorite A-list actors, the movie had a fresh concept that kept you guessing to the very end. I also have to say I was really surprised at how good Channing Tatum's acting was in this movie. All around great cast and great plot.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I don't live in D.C. (thankfully), and I'm not in politics (gratefully), but I am thoroughly enjoying this series (have watched 3 episodes this far). Great script and acting by all, especially Mr. Spacey who plays the leading role perfectly. This is about power politics pure and simple. Warning, it can be very discerning to watch the lies and game-playing. All too real. No wonder Congress' approval rating is in single digits these days.<br /><br />If you're a political junkie this is a must watch. If you admire Spacey's work (who doesn't?) don't miss a single episode.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. The Wizard of Oz is my ultimate favorite movie of all time. I was so excited when this movie came out. The last Oz related movie that I had seen was Return to Oz, and while that movie was dark and not for children it was fantastic. This movie has great special effects but other than that it lacks it plot and any type of storyline. I have no problem with the characters being dark but I felt that all the actors over-acted in this film and there was an overall overly fake feeling to the entire movie.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I laughed a lot and the storing was interesting, some nice action too.  The main actors were excellent.  I'm looking forward to Red 2.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Still enjoying the pomp(ous) and glory of Downton, so much so that I can't wait for season 4.  But I am sad for the loss os Sybyl & Matthew, the 2 nicest characters on the series.
B004SVM7BW|1.0|Didn't work for me.  Didn't bring up recent PDFs I had opened.  I will have to call and find out what the problem is.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|The beginning worried me with it's small screen but once it opened to full size I was able to enjoy the full extent of my Sony Bravia.
0062255657|5.0|A little bit metaphysical, a little bit fantasy, and a whole lot real.<br /><br />My Take<br />WOW! This is fabulous!! It's a buy in my book.<br /><br />I fell in love with it when the protagonist confessed his love for books-- \\"books were safer than other people...\\" It may be a sad occasion, but he is okay with it, as he retreats to his room with that boxed collection of Narnia books. <br /><br />I will confess for myself...it's an odd story with contentment and sad events. It's through the perspective of a bright boy with compassion, a kid who lacks experience or a sense of other---and it's this point of view that gives it its charm.<br /><br />\\"I was a normal child. Which is to say, I was selfish and I was not entirely convinced of the existence of things that were not me ... There was nothing that was more important to me than I was.\\"<br /><br />It's a slow build and an enjoyable read with characters who retain their mystery. Gaiman drops bits and pieces along the way and we slowly learn how different the Hempstocks are, but we never do know just what or who they are for sure. And the idea of them...I want it to go on.<br /><br />I love the sense of the old farmhouse that Gaiman creates. It's a place I want to visit, to spend some time, to eat some fresh baked bread with blackberry jam, and drink milk fresh from the cow. It's a cozy place with cozy characters, strange but welcoming. The Hempstocks themselves are who I think of as salt of the earth. Basic, practical, with the essentials of living in mind and magic at hand.<br /><br />His own place, with all the land around it, is also fantastical with all sorts of possibilities to explore.<br /><br />When Lettie first mentions the ocean and her mother calls it the pond, my first reaction was skepticism. I mean, how can you mistake a pond for an ocean and then I immediately thought ah, she's a little girl, and it's her fantasy, calling the pond her ocean with dreams of going beyond perhaps? It was a thought, an oh, brother that didn't leave my mind, but Gaiman slowly changed my mind, bringing me to realize the magic at Hempstock Farm.<br />\\"I liked myths. They weren't adult stories and they weren't children's stories. They were better than that. They just were.\\"<br />.<br />Crack me up! It was so gruesomely enjoyable to read as he does surgery on his foot, poking away, pulling along, snapping! Ick!!!<br />This is also a story on listening to your children. Pay attention to them. Don't dismiss what they have to say without exploring what they are trying to tell you. And don't make adults who are supposed to be responsible around children into gods. Don't expect your child to want what you want. They are their own person with their own passions and preferences.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to know more, I was satisfied with what I was allowed to know---although I do wish Gaiman had given out more names! It was complete with a sense of mystery.<br /><br />The Story<br />It begins in memory. A thought of those long ago days when first he met Lettie and through her, Ursula. A bad economy and a man's sense of honor that makes it possible for him to meet a special friend who opens him to a spiraling path.<br /><br />Both bright and a child, he's a contradiction whose frustrations quickly escalate with the new threat. One with which his friend can help him.<br /><br />It's a bugaboo that will change his perspective and his life. If only he could remember...<br /><br />The Characters<br />He's seven in the memories of his thoughts, and it's forty years later when he remembers. Fluffy is his new black kitten who seems to think he's a dog. Monster is the replacement. But only physically. His parents and sister are typical for a family. Ocean is the kitty he plucked.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is amazing! I love to play on it! I cant put it down! I reccomend it to anyone who wants an addicting game to pass the time.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly should have been on for several seasons. This outer space western delivers the entertainment. The crew of the Serenity, a Firefly class spaceship, is quite good on their own. Then they go to a planet or planets and chaos breaks out like in the Old West, but they always triumph. Captain Malcolm Reynolds, played by Nathan Fillion, makes it worth watching on his merits alone.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|This Reacher novel is typical of all other Lee Child books.  It grabs my attention in paragraph one and does nothing but heightens it throughout the entire novel.  Reacher is a typical MP Major like i encountered throughout my twenty year military career, he grabs hold of a problem and tears it down to its basic element and then puts it all together again while solving the mystery.
1451648537|4.0|Excellent read! Steve Jobs left such a mark on the world, but he will only be remembered by the people alive today, unlike others who came before him.<br />[...]
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is not for the weak! it is a mind bender that will have you on your knees begging for more! definitely one of the best brain teasing puzzles I have ever played!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gripping story -could not put it down from the moment I started reading. Engaging, entertaining & most unpredictable. A great read!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|The acting is superb.  I love all the asides that 'Frank' makes.  I believe politics works just like it is portrayed here... slimy & self-serving.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|So often we think that elite athletes are born special-- special bones, special muscles, special skills, special training regimens, etc.  It was so great reading about a guy from the Midwest like me that, with work, determination, and a willingness to think outside the box (eating vegan) was able to accomplish so much.  You can't read this book and not want to go for a run (which I've been doing now) and the recipes are great!  The Chipotle pinto beans are a huge hit, as is the guacamole and the whole grain fruit pancakes.  I feel better, look better and weigh less, and I've only scratched the surface of the lifestyle changes I need to make.  Definitely buy this book.
B00CELB94E|5.0|Honestly i haven't even heard all of the tracks. Once through on the first 8, allready love it. They just left Noel in their wake. It's the best stuff I've heard in a long time. I'm a big Oasis fan and this stuff is even better.
B006S01GH2|4.0|A little bizarre life for this girl, but very entertaining and captivating.  Excellant music as well. The subtitles were easly to follow.
B001CB4SRW|5.0|This is the sheath you need for the Surge.<br /><br />Why?? It holds the complete 40 piece bit kit and its adapter, plus 3 FULL sets of file/saw blades, and a Vulcan fire piston or ferro rod to boot!<br /><br />The leather sheath wouldnt hold all that, and was impossible to mount on my Blackhawk CQB Riggers belt, plus the snap was puny in comparison to the velcro on the nylon version.<br /><br />Arrived quickly and in new condition.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun 4 everyone!!the kids love it and give it 5 bannanas!!!!!if your minion crazy this is the game for you....

0525478817|4.0|I spent an entire year mentally preparing myself for The Fault in Our Stars. I read some terrible books, awesome books and your classic \\"meh\\" books. And whenever I'd go to decide which book I wanted to read next, I'd glance at The Fault in Our Stars' spine and simply turn my head away. To be completely honest, I don't think I have ever truly went out of my way to avoid a book like this and it's unlike me to do so. I usually tackle things head on, showing no fear, but with this book I had to approach things differently due to its subject matter. But then Jenn from The Bawdy Book Blog threw this in as a review suggestion, because obviously I needed some John Green edumacation. And I'm so happy someone finally pushed me to read this book because it did not disappoint. Well, not exactly...<br /><br />It's easy to see why John Green has the following he does. There is just something magical in the way he strings his sentences together that I can't help but admire it. It's simple, deep and humorous all at the same time. And the biggest thing I worried about when diving into this book was the sadness. You go into the book knowing the characters are terminal and I didn't know how I would fare connecting with a character, loving a character, to ultimately have them suffer and die. I'm a really easy crier and I don't like seeing people (fictional or real) suffer. But somehow John Green manages to take a cancer book and fill it with the sweetest memories.<br /><br />For a good portion of The Fault in Our Stars, I found myself chuckling at Hazel and Augustus' dry humor. The first half was generally light-hearted despite the grim situation the characters were in. Even when things got more serious, the humor was subtly there as a convenient ice-breaker of sorts. If I could describe it, I'd liken it to a grandparent making a joke about their impending death. It's awkward and uncomfortable, but oddly reassuring that it's possible to joke about something so morbid. Life goes on.<br /><br />The plot was simply \\"ok\\" for me, never wowing me or keeping me on the edge of my seat. It, at times, seemed to just float by with occasional things happening. There weren't many plot twists or \\"ah ha!\\" moments because you could tell from the beginning how it would end. You knew from the subject matter that it would be sad, and yet... I did not really cry. I did shed The Lonely Tear, but it wasn't for the characters. It was because of the situation they were in. It was because cancer sucks. Don't get me wrong, this is a beautifully written book, but the problem I ran into was the questionable authenticity of the protagonists. They never felt like teenagers. I get that they were intelligent and spent a lot more time contemplating life than your average teen, but they never felt real to me. Now, I'm not exactly a stranger to John Green himself. I religiously watch his history webshow on Youtube and I'm often amazed at this guy. But it was like he sat down and created mini-Despicable-Me-minon-like John Greens for this novel. They are all witty, super intelligent and too pretentious for their own good.<br /><br />Further, it was almost like Green relied on the severity of the ending and the character's intelligence to jar emotion from the reader. Clearly, this worked since two weeks after finishing, I cried while making pancakes just from thinking about Augustus' letter to Hazel. But again, this was not for the characters. It wasn't remotely similar or as powerful of an emotion that I'd felt after I read A Walk to Remember where I cried in my 8th grade English class under my desk. I'm talking about complete and utter sorrow for Landon and everyone else. DON'T JUDGE ME. :P<br /><br />Anyway, while I remain conflicted on how I feel about the characters, it doesn't negate the fact that this is a fabulous, smart read that I'd recommend to others.<br /><br />Reviews and more at Cuddlebuggery Book Blog!/><br />The plot was simply \\"ok\\" for me, never wowing me or keeping me on the edge of my seat.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Happy to own this, I like all the extra info on the other discs. Im not going to rate ever movie because I hate people who do that, I enjoy the franchise and the concept of all of the movies. It came quickly and the price is great
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I'm really at a loss for words. This book defies categorization for me. Suffice it to say that I've enjoyed this read as much as anything I've ever picked up.
B004SIP6A4|5.0|Fast shipping, I love the film, sing along with it while cleaning or even sitting and watching. I think it's a great movie to watch over and over again
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I purchased the 4 song EP after I saw him on That Metal Show and loved it. I had to buy this before it even came out just to make sure I had it on Aug. 8th. This whole album is fantastic. The first reaction from several coworkers was this album is more Metalica than Metalica these days, but that's not really fair to Newsted because this is what we expected of him when he left in the first place. King of the underdogs indeed.
1401937268|4.0|but they are hard to read.  There isn't enough information on the booklet to help us to read the cards.
034580404X|5.0|This was a great deal for the trilogy. I couldn't put the books down once I started. Great read, not for the shy :)
B001PPLIEQ|1.0|WOW this is just about the worst Bond movie ever...at over 2 1/2 hrs., it's a real SLOG just to sit thru.........oh well, guess ya can't win 'em all!!!
0765365278|3.0|As far as Sanderson's novels go, this is not one of his best. . .so far.<br /><br />Way of Kings is nothing more than a set-up novel as Stormlight Archives is set for ten books.<br /><br />Read it expecting nothing and you'll enjoy it. Expect the rollercoaster emotions similar to Mistborn and you will most likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Nothing truly groundbreaking occurs in the novel, which surrounds the storylines of three main characters- Kaladin, a 19 year old war veteran who has been betrayed and sold as a branded dangerous slave, Shallan who is trying to save her family's secrets, and Dalinar, the uncle of the current paranoid king who starts having visions of past warriors and battles that have shaped their country as it is today.<br /><br />It is a good book as far as introduction novels go but if you're holding out, I'd wait until March 2014 when book 2 is released and you have something to carry on the story quickly, especially if you are an impatient reader.
0756407915|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book. Rothfuss' way with words is entrancing. He's a very good storyteller and the story just flows perfectly.<br /><br />The story picks up where it left off in NotW and covers a lot more ground. You start at the Waystone of course, spend some time at University where Kvothe's relationship with Ambrose is more defined, then Severen, Felurian's woods, Ademre, and back to the University.<br /><br />It is set up in a way where I believe the majority of his past story is nearly complete and most of book 3 will surround current day events. So I believe most of the information to create theories for book 3 is available in Wise Man's Fear.<br /><br />It was a great middle book for this unfinished trilogy. Lots of information, emotion, and clues. I thoroughly enjoy coming up with theories for unfinished series so this book was just fantastic to me. Rothfuss is very clever in where he places the hints and hidden meanings, some of which don't stand out until you reread the novel.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|The movie was entertaining.  I wish they would have developed the plot a bit more, but thumbs up on this one.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This movie was pretty good.  There were a few plot inconsistencies and it was a little long, but generally the story was entertaining and we enjoyed watching it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|First episode is sucky but the rest of the show is awesome!! You will fall in love with the Doctor!
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I luv it but seriously maple fire or whatever fix your app on mine because when I go to the tower and try to look at the code it doesn't work so what's the point to this dumb game when I have to restart it when I'm in the middle and since I said that I don't really like it any more!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just read this book for the second time and in enjoyed it even more the second time. It is very well written and the plot keeps you from putting it down.
0061122416|5.0|A good, all time classic book with a good life lesson within. I have a copy and have purchased and given as gifts to several, over the years. It then becomes one of their favorites as well.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Writing is very good, you can picture it as you read.  Saw the movie then read the book.  Glad I did this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|perfect game to spend the time keep you thinking that working to solve all the problems very intuitive very nice
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush. The graphics rule. So glad it's free. I love it on my kindle fire hd. Just like temple run and subway surfers but better
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I had seen these shows many years ago but they are still great shows to watch!!<br />I am looking forward to seeing the second season.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The kindle app is even better than the iPhone app, in my opinion. I like having the bigger screen. This game is so addictive. I could play for hours if I had the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app and I loved it! My sister's couldn't join my game though. I did some research and every other Appstore has version0.7.2 but we only have 0.7.1
1118488768|5.0|Love this book and it applies to all kinds of marketing; social, b2b, b2c, illustrates concepts that can be used in any marketing plan!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic. It made me feel a full spectrum of emotions in only a few hundred pages. It brings you back to a time when your life may have simpler, yet the lives of the characters in the story are nothing but complicated. It's a great warm-up book if you've been away from reading for a while because it's nice and easy. I would definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Totally reccomend this app! Great graphics, fun to play, addctive and free! Love. It, anyone who loves temple run this is great for you too.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Started watching it 4 days ago and I'm almost done with season 3 now!! Love it!!! I'll need to get HBO to continue watching!!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Lewis makes the truth read like compelling fiction.  It takes an unusually talented and dedicated writer to squeeze details for this much excitement.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Life of Pi is the best book I have ever read. Martel brings out the character of Pi so well. You feel connected to him.<br />Unfortunately I haven't been able to find another book as good as Life of Pi. Everything else I am reading now seems inferior in comparison.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|I'm not a fan of fantasy to begin with, so any review by me is biased.<br />I thought it was same old - same old, even in that genre. Another special-effects exercise with predictable progression.
0062068415|4.0|But a little hard to follow and keep up with characters - gradually unfolds story - requires some backtracking to keep up
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Not much else to say about it.  Listen and learn what awesome is.  Would recommend to anyone with any taste at all.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|I was searching for a pair of 'expensive' headphones, while reading a review headphone amps were mentioned. I had no idea the existed. But after some reading I decided on this model. I like the fact that I can control the gain. I use this connect to my iPhone 5 via LOD connector (have to buy the 30 pin adapter). I also connected a bluetooth transmitter so I can be cable free while moving around. I don't walk around with the complete setup, it sits on my desk at work. I would highly recommend getting a headphone amp if you are listening to music via a portable music player. You'll probably won't listen without one again once you hear what you've been missing!!  I bought the Sony MDR-1RBT, they sound great when paired with the amp!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Not much else to say about it.  Listen and learn what awesome is.  Would recommend to anyone with any taste at all.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I stayed up all night to read it. i just couldn't put it down from the very moment I downloaded it from the Kindle Website. Tom Clancy is majestic, he knows how to develop a crescendo to get you to the top of the mountain. This book though fictional still resonate with a lot of current affairs in our world. This book is well written
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Not much else to say about it.  Listen and learn what awesome is.  Would recommend to anyone with any taste at all.
B00E8B1358|1.0|It was boring, bad acting and no story.  Would advise anyone I know to save their money on this one.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|Not much else to say about it.  Listen and learn what awesome is.  Would recommend to anyone with any taste at all.
0064471837|5.0|The Abhorsen Series is unlike any other series I've read. It offers a unique world and experience, and is expertly delivered. A book you can read again and again, and get a different experience each time.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Not much else to say about it.  Listen and learn what awesome is.  Would recommend to anyone with any taste at all.
B001NHNG64|4.0|A true Jack Reacher novel. Keeps you reading from the first page! Can't wait for the next one! Keep them coming!
B000001C6M|5.0|Not much else to say about it.  Listen and learn what awesome is.  Would recommend to anyone with any taste at all.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, both because Lincoln was such a great leader in American history and because in any role Daniel Day-Lewis takes on he far exceeds my expectations.  However, I found this movie to be long and rather uninspiring.  Because it is all dialogue, it could easily be adapted to the stage.  The characters were not developed, and I felt I should have done some reading and research before I watched the movie so as to understand many of them.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Fields were outstanding in their roles, but my husband and I both had a hard time staying awake through this movie.
B000062YB1|5.0|Not much else to say about it.  Listen and learn what awesome is.  Would recommend to anyone with any taste at all.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|So far an enjoyable game.  Plays well on kindle fire hd.  Thanks gameloft.<br />It'd nice to see games worth a hoot for the fire. Keep them coming. The graphics are nice and the gameplay flows well.
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|I must be going crazy here....either this is some crafty plagiarism or mabe the same movie but,  This movie was made and released years ago. I wasted my money on what I thought was a new movie.<br />Horrible, horrible, horrible...it IS NOT WORTH .99cents, but amazon charges $9.99
B001XUJMZK|5.0|I've seen it before - well worth a second watch. Mel Gibson in one of his better performances. Good buy!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Saw it online, downloaded it and now can't leave it alone. The reef just keeps growing and looks beautiful. It's addicting!
B0037NVM1I|4.0|Much better than the original. Arnold actually shows some real acting ability. Plus, he can talk! I've seen it before and will probably watch it again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A thrilling read! The lives of multiple people woven so intricately together! What a fantastic book! Thank you Ms. moriarty
B002HSSAY6|3.0|This was hard yo follow at first - took a while for the basic plot to unravel. Never did figure out why the hero was there in the first place
B001O7JHSE|5.0|Ok...let's get it out there, there is a ton of racist stuff in here, but when your neo-nazi that's what the life is about. This has a great story to it, if you can get over the fact. I bought this in the beginning looking for the scene from 25th hour, thinking this was the movie...which obviously, 25th hour is 25th hour and not American History X. I did enjoy this movie though.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like playing this game with friends.  Easy to learn.  I just wish there were more free coins available without having to buy them.  After playing a few games the coins run out & then you have to wait for another day to earn the daily coins.
B004P29LEU|4.0|This was one of his earlier career films and some might consider it a flop. Just look at some of the reviews. I don't see it as a flop. Depp once again proves why he was and is one of Hollywood's best. Great movie, great cast as Julianne Moore was part of the supporting cast. Basically...long story short, Joon, played by Mary Stuart Masterson (from Law and Order fame) loses a poker game but by doing that she wins the heart of Benny (played by Depp). After the two of them fall in love, they try to set up her brother (played greatly by Aidan Quinn) for love..it's a lot of great mixes in it, some off beat humor along the lines. I'd recommend it. I found it to be a good movie at an awesome price
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|waste of time. &#34;funny&#34; lines were trying too hard to be funny. Tom cruise is trying too hard to be cool in this movie.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It should be on the reading list in high school so we start creating generations where professionals regardless of sex are treated equal.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging and fun to play. It keeps your mind sharp. I am looking forward to future levels of play.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Fox, you done screwed up. Such a shame 14-episodes and one film is all we got. If you've done the episodes, but haven't checked out the film yet, go for it. If you haven't done the episodes, give them a look first. Serenity stands alone fine, but having the back story adds a bit.
B0099116AY|4.0|This was  funny and cute. I mainly bought this because I love these actors. They did a wonderful job portraying their characters.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Harrison Ford must have an awful agent to have to appear in this turkey.  It's so bad I would be embarrassed to donate it to Goodwill.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie , the actors did an incredible job with this movie. This movie kept you  in suspense. I would recommend this for adults.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I really like this game, the only one I have on my android device. The bad thing is that it has some errors. There are archivments I can't accomplish because the game doesn't let me do it; and sometimes even for a quad-core processor, the game gets slow for a couple of seconds.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|This set of DVDs is a great deal costing only what it would cost for one and we got the whole trilogy!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A vivid story of a family seen through the perspectives of each member.  This is one those books that you hate to see end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So far the game has been fun. A good game for any horse lover for sure. Looking forward to unlocking more of the game.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|This book deals with the conflict between the people and organizations  that worked for or against US entry into the European War.  A real eye-opener on the more unpleasant aspects of Lindbergh's character and refusal to re-examine his prejudices when faced with new information.  Very enjoyable.
B00E8B1358|2.0|For a film production that invested so much money in a starring cast and striking special effects, why was a cogent story omitted? Only the special effects kept me from giving this movie one star.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was instantly drawn in to the story.  I do love a good mystery!  Ms. Flynn does an amazing job developing the characters.  Do you love them? Do you hate them?  I adored the surprise twists.  Did not see them coming!  I highly recommend this novel to fans who like a book they can not put down!
1607066017|5.0|I bought Vol. 1 for the beautiful illustrations. I stayed for the world-building. I ended up caring because of the characters. This is a very contemporary mashing of pop-culture to create new creatures and ideas. They talk on contemporary cell phones and swing swords, yet throw magic and shoot laser guns. They wear hip contemporary clothes while zooming around in tree spaceships. It's a very interesting, if not entirely convincing world of robots with TVs for heads and traditional forest sprite-like creatures in an expansive space war. Even if the world doesn't feel completely convincing, it was still fun and the characters are worth caring about and rooting for. The characters, story, and message are far better than his Y: The Last Man story I read a while ago. He has come a long way in his story telling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is a really good game, it has great graphics and very enjoyable<br /><br />Fabulous app!!<br /><br />(But it does take a long time to load)
B00BC24NT4|5.0|This was a page turner that kept my interest from the first page. I highly recommend to any la Carre' fan.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more for Seth Rogan than Barbara. There was a real conflict, more than one and the writing drew me in so that I cared about things. I cared about whether he would sell him product, I cared about whether she would meet her first love, I cared about whether they would resolve the tension between them. Barbara played it subtly so her acting didn't over shadow the plot. It was an enjoyable movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I cant wait to see the next season!  I am hooked.  Always new twists and turns!  The actors are great at what they do!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This game is good for making you think and figure things out. Admittedly, I don't always appear to be a shining star in such situations, and I am currently only working on level five. But it is honestly a refreshing change from the 'candy' and 'gem' baloney that is out there in hideous batches these days.<br /><br />Game play involves looking closely at the decorated ball on the front of the 'factory' box it comes in. When you open a level, the box opens and a white ball rises up out of it. Above this, all the tools/supplies you need to make this white ball look just like the one on the front of the box. Not as easy as it sounds, because you have to figure out which step will garner what results and in what order you need to perform them to get the desired result. It IS easy, in theory. But you realize after you have painted the ball blue that you need a pair of black 'eyes' on it, but if you dip it in the black paint the entire ball will be black... no 'eyes'. This is where the tools come in. Dip the ball in the black paint first, then select the goggles, which fit perfectly over the ball where the 'eyes' should be. Then dip it in the blue paint, remove the goggles, and there you have a blue ball with black 'eyes'. Common sense, strategy and good organizational skills will help you through this game.<br /><br />So far, I am enjoying it. I just wish I had more time for things like this... then I could hang around painting eyes on little blue balls whenever I want...  : )
B00CF34B2I|5.0|A smart game for smart people.  An exciting sequel to the franchise.  There are an endless amount of ways each game can play out. I've played for over 100 hours and looking forward to the next 100.
B000088E77|5.0|I choose this rating because this is a great cd<br />I like every song<br />I would recommend it to every one

B00B89LZ4C|1.0|This item should clearly be marketed as a statuette or figurine, NOT an Action Figure. It has zero articulation, the gun is fixed to the hand, and it does not come with any sort of base or stand to keep it upright. When I opened it and tried to make it stand on its own, it promptly fell over, causing the hat, sunglasses and duffle bag, which are not attached, to fall off. This is a very large problem, as these items are so small that they could potentially be lost forever this way. This is a terrible product besides the fact that it looks exactly like Bryan Cranston. However, even in that respect it is not useful for custom figures because the head is firmly attached to the body, as there is ABSOLUTELY NO ARTICULATION. I have also noticed that Mezco products have a nasty habit of falling off of their cards by themselves. I sincerely wish that NECA would buy the licensing to this show and make some proper ACTION FIGURES.<br /><br />The absolute only positive thing I can say about it is the sculpting. This would be a wonderful product if it were marketed as a statuette and came with a stand or base, but as is, DO NOT BUY.

B005IQZB14|4.0|From adversity with love.  One would have been well advised to avoid Cheryl in turmoil, but oh how beautifully she cleaned up.  This book took me out of my comfort zone, both high and low.
B009DH379C|5.0|Not the best Queen live performance on Disc--that's be their 20 minutes at &#34;LIve AID&#34; where they crushed all--but a mighty good show nonetheless, shot on film and looks it. The extras alone are worth the price of admission, with the band interviews and various rock-star larking about. The Blu-Ray looks fantastic and the mix (with some post-gig &#34;sweetening&#34;, ie; cheating) puts you right there, front and center. They just don't make bands like Queen anymore....
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Very repetitive; clearly unvalidated; took a weird, scrambled, dreamlike experience and cooked it up into a best-seller. Not to say he doesn't believe what he thinks he saw, but his relatively quick dismissal of all other possible explanations for it seriously lacks credibility. I felt worse after reading it, rather than uplifted.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|A little bit of Mythology, action, sex, & comedy all roled into this one season.  Love Bo and what she represents for women in today's society.
B002SRQ214|4.0|this super fast 3.4Ghz AMD Phenom and decided to take a chance. Made the right decidion. My PC is 10X faster now and it was a breeze to install it. The fact it'll do 4.2GHz with a Cooler Master Hyper 212EVO and the fan still doesn't spin up to max is icing on the cake. Clock for clock the Phenom II is faster than a Bulldozer!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read all the books, and the movie is very different from the book.  Lots more detail in the book, I was almost lost on a few scenes, but a movie that you can watch over and over, like Twlight saga.  I can't wait for the second movie to come out.

B0064MPXFA|3.0|Decently written, plotted and paced, The Good Wife's main failing are the typical, tired and tedious jabs at preferred liberal targets (Sarah Palin) and the typical, tired and tedious plot lines about racism, sexism, etc. Meh.

B004US4K2C|3.0|This utility worked as expected. I toyed with it a while and didn't use it much further. I found that the Kindle standard interface was superior to this on a Kindle Fire HD.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Almost two centuries have passed since the days of Jack Builder and Lady Aliena, chronicled in \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", and the city of Kingsbridge, with its magnificent cathedral and annual fleece fair, is flourishing as Follett returns us to that mediaeval locale on the eve of one of the greatest upheavals of human history: the Black Death. This sequel is similar to the original novel in style and scope, following five interconnected point of view characters through multiple decades of mid-14th century English history, political intrigue, and architecture.<br /><br />Caris is the business-savvy, independent-minded daughter of a wealthy wool merchant. She is in love with Merthin, an apprentice builder, the son of an impoverished knight. Merthin's brother, Ralph, a nasty piece of work, is squire to the Earl of Shiring. Gwenda is a poor but quick-witted and determined peasant girl who befriends Caris in childhood. Godwyn is Caris's cousin, a monk at Kingsbridge Priory.<br /><br />Follett does an exquisite job of crafting his characters, and I am especially pleased with his ability to write strong, believable, sympathetic female point of view and secondary characters. In spite of the constraints of the society they inhabit which tends to dismiss them as \\"only women\\" and good for little more than pleasure and/or reproduction, his female characters display no lack of intelligence or agency, and frequently manage to outwit or earn the respect of their better educated, more privileged male peers. Many male authors have a hard time doing this (I am looking at you, Umberto Eco). In fact, if I did not know the identity of the author, I would probably not guess that this book was written by a man.<br /><br />On the flip side of this, we have Ralph. Bleh. He blunders through what can only be described as a charmed life, awash with unexamined male and class privilege. He believes that everyone else exists solely for his personal convenience. He's bitter about any privilege he does not already possess, can never let go of the pettiest grudge, and enjoys the suffering of others. Ironically, he admires his brother Merthin's ability to deal with people, which Merthin does by *treating them like people*, which Ralph is seemingly incapable of doing. I would have been happier had there been fewer scenes from Ralph's point of view. The inside of his head is a disgusting place. I don't think I have ever demanded a character \\"just diiiiiiie already!\\" so many times.<br /><br />Godwyn was the character who took me the longest to decide how I felt about him. At first, when he has no real power, his political machinations are delightful and amusing, in spite of the contempt in which he seems to hold all women apart from his mother. He is brutally ambitious and nowhere near as intelligent as he thinks he is. He is resentful when challenged and sulky when he doesn't get his way. I ended up despising him almost as much as I did Ralph.<br /><br />Caris and Merthin's long romance was a joy to read, as well as being a source of frustration. In some ways, the characters suffer from being \\"Generation Xerox\\", with these two resembling Aliena and Jack from the previous book (as Ralph seems to be William Hamleigh). But the challenges they face are different. Caris longs to lead a fulfilling and rewarding life, which she does not believe she can do as a wife and mother of children, and Merthin sometimes seems unreasonable in his inability to understand that she must choose between work and family, while he need not make that choice.<br /><br />Ken Follett succeeds in painting a picture of the middle ages that is both worse and better than most people probably think it was. Many authors fall into the trap of writing the mediaeval period as some kind of glorious and romantic adventure -- a thrilling time to be alive. If you suffer from such delusions, this book will cure you of them. The 14th century was a terrible time to be anyone except perhaps a high-rankingnobleman, and even then, there was a good chance of dying by violence or plague. While this book makes me supremely grateful that I do not live in the 14th century, it also serves as a reminder that mediaeval attitudes are still with us today, even if they are not as prevalent. We may be doing better here at the start of the 21st century, but we have not reached some glorious culmination of history; it's just a waypoint on the road, and there is still a long way to go.<br /><br />There is a lot of sex and violence (and some sexual violence) in this book, so if that troubles you, you might want to avoid it on that account. Such scenes are no more gratuitous, in my opinion, than in most fiction, and I was pleased with the sexual agency displayed by several of the female characters. There was a general lack of male gaze present in the text (compared, for example, to GRRM's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series), apart from in Ralph's chapters, but his treatment of women is consistently cast in a negative light.<br /><br />This is not high brow literature, but it's engaging story telling with careful attention paid to historical detail. Most adult readers should find it accessible and enjoyable, in spite of its length and subject matter.nobleman, and even then, there was a good chance of dying by violence or plague.

B001O1O71C|5.0|This wonderful little book had me thinking about very important things for many days. Things like freedom and belongings and opportunities and love and friendship and prejudice and caring and the list goes on and on. It was sobering and heartwarming and a reminder of the many things most of us take for granted every day. A must read for teens and adults alike.
1608871452|5.0|LOVE the book but when I got it the sleeve was torn quite a bit.  For a &#34;new&#34; purchase, didn't expect this.  The book itself more than made up for it though.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|[[ASIN:B00CWY76CC Can You Escape]]Game is very well thought out and clever. I really enjoy playing and discovering all of the neat little hiding spots. Its challenging at times but very addicting. I love all these types of games. I will continue to download any type of these apps in the future. Cant wait for new versions everytime I play one. This is a great one. If there was a way to give it 10 stars then I definitely would.

B005MMY9A8|4.0|Movie was good, wife and I watched it together. Had a problem with the feed from Amazon but it was resolved and we thoroughly enjoyed the film.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|The unit will not charge at all. While the cord is plugged in, it plays pretty good. But that's it. No wireless function to be had. So that kind sucks. I was lucky enough to have a USB extender cable, or the provided cord would have been too short to reach my couch.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns but did not give it a 5 star rating because it just started getting silly and unrealistic.  I like movies that could really happen.

Which is always a plus.<br />It easily collapses into a convenient briefcase size, for easy transport/storage.<br />It opens up to be much larger than expected.<br /><br />-Cons:<br />The desks and tables didn't stay together well, but a dab of super-glue on each fixed that quick.<br />The some of the small parts Very small, so it's not for 5yr and below (chocking hazard).
030758836X|5.0|Great book. Kept you guessing. Half way through the book will shock you! At the end the book will shock you again! Good story, well written, a lot of fun to read and will get you thinking about the human psyche.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started with the free book 1 and can't help going to the whole series. And it seems so short, that I really want to know more details of their life and what do they think under such conditions. Seems very bare and rural at first glance, but actually deep technology beneath the whole operation. The 2nd series (SHIFT) will reveal more details. Thanks Hugh!

B00BWC1UZE|5.0|This album is definitely a departure from the poppy FututreSexLoveSounds. That being said, JT has really explored a different facet of himself; one that imbibes an air of smooth jazz swagger and Motown. Of course pop tracks like \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" point to his prior Pop influence, there are tracks such as \\"Mirrors\\" which offer up an entirely new JT styling and feel. A hidden gem is found in the backwards_playing_sound (remember the days you'd turn your record backwards with the needle on? Oh you don't? Shit I'm old) and a repetitive sound sample (my guess, a slide carousel) as backing track of \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" a really tender, touching side of J.T. which as always appealed to me. I am anxious for Part 2!
B00000IL1K|1.0|I bought this CD based on the overwhelming positive reviews, but Brightman's voice is handled as an accompaniment to the orchestra, instead of as the main event. I think she has a beautiful voice, but I kept wishing for the ability to turn down the orchestration, it drowned her out and made for an uncomfortable listening experience. One of my favorite songs, Nella Fantasia, was ruined by an irritating clang...clang...clang...clang...clang...clang...throughout, which I assume was some type of instrument. The ending of Nessun Dorma would have been outstanding...if Brightman's voice could have been HEARD over the orchestra.  And the vocal accompaniment on The Last Words You Said did not harmonize well with Brightman's voice.  Overall, if you are a Brighman fan, I would give this one a miss.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Do not, do not, do not watch this! This was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. I can't believe it was so dumb.
0064471837|5.0|The first time I picked up Sabriel was just by chance. My brother, who is five years my junior, had stolen the book from his middle school library and had it laying on his bedroom floor; I was 18 years old and just wanted something to read while waiting to meet up with my friends. Instead of going out, I ended up reading the entire book that night. How could I not, right? The fantastical story of a young girl that finds her true self by going to a alternate dimension in order to save her father from one of the Greater Dead, which in turn leads her to becoming a powerful necromancer, saving a prince from captivity and becoming a nation's hero.<br /><br />As a fantasy lover, this book perfectly satisfied my appetite; as an avid reader, it kept me involved with it's descriptive landscapes and emotional involvement with the characters. After that, it was over. I was hooked. It took rereading Sabriel's story five or six times over the next few years to finally look into if her story continued. Needless to say, when I found that Nix had not one, but TWO more Abhorsen books, I was beyond stoked.<br /><br />I have since reread the Abhorsen Trilogy over twenty times, bought each book about half a dozen times (I keep lending them out and telling people that they can have them), and have found that I cannot seem to go over a year without reading them. These books have been my security blanket when I have been unsure of my journey of growing into an adult. They have been the hug that I need when I am upset. They have become my very best of friends.

B00CPTUNBK|3.0|My Little Pony: Equestria Girls is the first feature length movie based off of the Fourth Generation of My Little Pony. It's directed by Jayson Thiessen and written by Meghan McCarthy, stars Tara Strong, Ashleigh Ball, Andrea Libman, Tabitha St. Germaine, and more voice actors. It had its fun moments and got a couple laughs out of me but ultimately it failed to capture why this series is so endearing to its fans in the first place.<br /><br />THE BLU-RAY:<br /><br />Crisp sound and visual quality. The songs, while forgettable mostly, sounded great with surround sound.<br /><br />There's some visual problems but they are probably technical errors with the film itself. Fortunately, there's less model errors here than in the show.<br /><br />This is also Hasbro's first real attempt to make quality special features for the My Little Pony Brand. The Karaoke songs and Ponify-Yourself are fun features for kids, I guess. The real reason why I purchased this movie was for the Behind the Scenes material, actually. It was nice to hear the opinions from an actor, the writer, the animators, and Hasbro executives from this movie.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray release is a good step in the right direction for future My Little Pony releases.<br /><br />THE MOVIE:<br /><br />For the most part, the movie was decently written. There were some funny fish-out-of-water written scenes, the first half had me enticed with what was going on and what was on stakes, and the world Twilight travels to was interesting.<br /><br />There's tons of visual references and returning cameos for the older fans. While some were subtle and funny, it did feel like there were a bit too much background characters from the show now in the movie. Trixie's cameo was fun and it would have been nice if she played a bigger more meaningful role.<br /><br />The songs, usually a strength of the series, unfortunately weren't really memorable in this outing. Most of them are really forgettable and I have never really been a fan of pop music. Having seen the movie twice now, only the 'Help Twilight Win the Crown' comes off as memorable and catchy.<br /><br />The villain of the film comes off as disappointing towards the end. At first, she seems like a real threat to Twilight and her friends. Diabolical, scheming, and a villain that would get under Twilight's skin (which in the series, doesn't often happen since most villains have no personal grudges or are equal to Twilight). Unfortunately, she becomes a monologue-heavy heavy villain at the end, hatches some implausible plan to take over the world with an army of teenagers, lets the girls power up to defeat her, and instantly 'redeems' herself, giving a lazy excuse for why she did everything. Her two henchmen, Snips and Snails literally became the Bulk and Skull of the movie for no reason other than the two being famous for being (unwilling) servants of Trixie in the show. It would have been nice if they weren't recycled characters and instead, new characters like Sunset Shimmer.<br /><br />Twilight and Spike are the stars of this movie. Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are great too though the same can't be said for Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash. Those three felt underplayed and that is where the movie really fell apart for me. At the end, we're supposed to accept that Twilight became friends with these human characters. But the movie never really make this concept plausible and we don't get enough time to have these three properly introduce themselves or do much in the film. It's where I honestly think this movie missed the mark the whole series's really about. The point of the movie outside to sell the EqG toylines, according to McCarthy and the other staff was to show how friendship could go beyond the pony world of Equestria. I don't think McCarthy and the others succeeded in that, which is a shame for the first movie from this series.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic has never really been about the songs, the villains, the world, or the overarching epic stories. It was about the friendship these six and more characters formed over the course of the series. The first two parter of the series even managed to convey the whole message within 44 minutes as opposed to the 66 minutes this film had. It left me believing why Twilight would approach these five with open arms at the end.<br /><br />Equestria Girls is a decent film that has some fun and funny moments. But as an older fan of the series, this movie fails to hit the mark that makes Friendship is Magic so appealing to so many older fans. In the grand scheme of things, Equestria Girls would actually fall into one of the worst episodes list, which is still decent and better than the usual cartoon movies targeted at this younger demographic (such as the Barbie movies from Mattel Entertainment). Hopefully we might see another movie or special next time that will focus on the pony characters in Equestria and stick true to the magic of friendship the show has.

B00BWJARHO|1.0|Closed captions on every movie we have rented has had some kind of problem.  On this one, the closed caption was about 15 seconds ahead of the actural movie, made watching it very hard...by the end of the first fifteen minutes it was,,,,TURN THIS THING OFF...IT'S TOO HARD TO KEEP TRACK.  So we stopped  watching it.  If you don't need closed captions....okay, you're fine but if you do it's a big pain.  No recommendation for ones who need closed caption.
B00ANY94A0|4.0|This was my first Lego Friends purchase so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  My girls love to make habitats for their creatures and this fit the bill.  But it is amazingly tiny!  They love it, but be aware it is SMALL (small parts).  Not foot crippling small, because I think the parts are too small to feel much of anything if you accidentally step on them!  The kids sure love these though.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|Great read - almost impossible to put down if you lived through this era and are over 18 now.  One of the best views of what drove the collapse and the gut-wrenching world of short sellers
B00CS65JS2|3.0|Some of this music sounds familiar. Beyond sounds a lot like I Keep Forgettin by Michael McDonald. The opener, Give Life Back To Music, is reminiscent of Evelyn King's Shame. It's no coincidence those songs came from the late 1970s and early 1980s, back when disco soul was still the pinnacle of pop music. That's the era this Daft Punk album, nostalgically entitled Random Access Memories, is tuned to. And the duo, with quite a bit of outside help from real instrument-playing musicians, Nile Rodgers of Chic included, does a remarkable job of capturing that vintage sound. It's the vocals laid atop that dampers the experience. Paul Williams is enchanting on the Disney-ready Touch, the album's best song, but crooners like Todd Edwards and Pharrell are no (aesthetic) match for the grooves they're singing to.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I enjoyed playing Hotel Dash but I was duped out of money that I didn't need to spend... I found out I just needed to purchase the deluxe version instead of purchasing each hotel for .99cents.  Recently I purchased the deluxe version of Cooking Dash. Game is great but guest what! They want you to pay extra for additional restaurant. not fair. Also, the feature of the ground meat doesn't work in the Deluxe Restaurant. One cannot complete the deluxe restaurant, as it doesn't work. I wont be duped again.  I am really disappointed, as I really like the Dash games...  Get rid of the ads!
B00ANY7V8M|4.0|My girls love this.  It was my first leg friends purchase.  My initial reaction was- &#34;wow, I didn't know they made Legos this small!&#34;.  If you are familiar with Lego Friends, I guess this is how they are made.  But teeny, teeny, teeny!<br /><br />My girls love to make &#34;habitats&#34; for creatures, and this was about all I could find to fill the bill.  It worked.  I am guessing no more than $1 worth of plastic in there so wow that air is expensive!
B0081YBD8A|5.0|Too bad the series ended. I enjoyed season 1 and 2 very much. Its like you really get to know these girls and enjoy being a fly on the wall into their lives. The acting is top notch!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game. It can become a bit addictive. The only downside would be the frequent and intrusive ads. They get frustrating. Still a good game for the brain..
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I really enjoyed this series,i  was told that Kurt Sutter from Sons of Anarchy had been a part of it and decided to see it. So I'll say this, this series is well worth your time.
B0090P98Z4|1.0|This game is not made for the kindle fire, its nothing but lag. How can you play when the quality of the game is too much for the kindle fire too take?
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|There are some woohoo references that might push away scientific minds; results happened just not in the time frames suggested.
B001EC3JME|4.0|A good holster for small flashlites, and portable on the belt for carrying them around. Very usefull purchase indeed !
B0041KBWM0|5.0|All the actors are outstanding, and there are enough episodes to really flesh out the book, unlike various movie adaptations.  As both a Masterpiece Classic & a Jane Austen fan, I highly recommend this.
B005OYKI1I|1.0|I did not get to watch this movie.  I like Vin Diesel.  Hopefully, I will get to see it soon.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|One of the best series on air right now. It's witty, sexy, smart and inspiring! I can't wait to watch season 3...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed it and so did my children.  Short but free so I can't complain. Looking forward to more levels.
B003XRELEI|5.0|It's typical Vonnegut.  I had to read this the first time in an AP English class in high school.  I fell in love with Vonnegut's writing and have read it several times since.  Just typical Vonnegut!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|To use all days around is waht is necessary because it carries a sharpener four every type os blade ! Good purchase.
B00D4PDJMY|5.0|Phil in all his bad assness! I would love him if he screamed the phone book. So not really a good person to be reviewing this.
1451627297|5.0|King is a phenomenal writer who grabbed my attention very quickly with this book. It is honestly a very creative, insightful, thought-provoking book that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's long and far-fetched and unrealistic, but if you can let yourself believe that time travel is possible, I guarantee that this book will entertain you.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Somehow, he can always guess who you're thinking about.  This game is kind of addicting.  It's great for killing time.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|The movie &#34;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&#34; is one that can entertain, keep you on the edge of your seat and make you stop and think about the very real scientific possibilities available today. Very well scripted and produced: Highly recommended!
1568363931|5.0|I love this book because it's a nice blend of Japanese and American.  There aren't a bunch of ingredients I'm unable to find, and it explains everything really well so I can understand it (I'm referring to the Japanese things, of course!)  Recommend it if you are packing bentos, or just interested in Japanese food.  It even gives you this nice timeline of how long things should take, and in what order you can prepare them to finish up quickest.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The best Sherlock Holmes show currently on tv.  They were able to modernize it and still stay true to the characters
B00CHILW64|5.0|An excellent drama, for those willing to go through the heartache. Acting was spot on and the script was fairly tight; smooth editing and direction as well.
0143038419|4.0|Inspirational and funny. I expected not to like this book. I assumed it would be cheesy and preachy, but I ended up really enjoying it. I watched the movie after reading the book, and I have to say that the movie was terrible. Don't judge the book by the movie.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|This story really makes you consider how we treat others. Everyone deserves respect. It's nice to see a guy love a cat. Smart man, smart cat!
B00448SE4S|5.0|Great music. Kids love this movie. Good pace and very funny. Not recommended for homophobes. Good gift for your favorite nerd or gamer or musician.
B00CATSONE|4.0|My wife knew of my interest in Tesla and got me this book. I was a bit surprized to find this book dealing with two of my favorite subjects; Tesla and the function of the mind. Very interesting and very inciteful. I think it will take some time to digest.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The movie was close to the book but having read all the Jack Reacher books and having him described as a &#34;huge man&#34;  &#34;a giant&#34; having huge hands....it was hard to think of Tom as him.  Tom did portray the expressions and talk very well.  Overall it was worth watching but would be a better movie for someone who hasn't read the books.
B00688628M|5.0|I bought these based on the recommendation of someone without having ever seen an episode.  I am generally not a history buff but this series is absolutely amazing.
0307743659|5.0|Wow. For anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the movie - you need to read this. I don't really want to give anything away, but it sure is an amazing book.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|If I had known that this series of books was going to extend into eternity, I would never have started reading them.<br /><br />I realize that there are rabid fans who have seen the tv series who will take offense, but I suspect that that number is drastically lower for the number of fans who have actually READ THE BOOKS.<br />I have to say that by the time I got into book four, I felt used and manipulated, with each book being created only as a springboard for the next one.  I would swear that Martin is getting paid by the word for this series.  I actually quit in the middle of the book and just gave up, when I heard that there were more books.<br />Before I was 1/4 of the way through the first book, I was having to take notes...who is related to whom?  Who killed whom.....There are so many characters, with names that sound alike, who pop in and out of the story line.  Oh! And don't actually think that anyone is actually the hero of the books.  Rest assured that they will be killed before long.<br />I understand he is a fan of Tolkein...as in George RR martin,  but this rolling ridiculous saga is an exercise in ego.  It's not worth the immense amount of paper invested in it.<br />If you must follow the story, just watch the tv series.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this is a fun quest HO game. I like the different levels.  A great way to pass the time.  Try it out.
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|This record was a touchstone of 1968.  Other \\"psychedelic\\" releases - even parts of Sgt Pepper - sound trite by comparison.  On Pepper most (not all) of the music and songs sound forced at times.  Not here.  The Byrds easily weave in and out of pop, rock, country, folk and jazz and even concrete - sometimes in the same tune.  I listen to this and I'm convinced bands like King Crimson were listening back before their sudden explosion in 1969.  So much great music was made in 1968 and if I could pick only one release from that year Notorious Brothers would be it for sure.  It's a shame that Crosby McGuinn Hillman Clarke alliance didn't hold because this was the upper most of the topper most.  The hidden track at the end where Crosby is are fighting with Michael Clarke while Gary Usher tries to keep things moving forward is very revealing. Contention seems to follow David Crosby around but I guess it is his passion for getting things right rather than good enough that bring that out.  I still don't like him much.  Any way, buy this, it is a very worthy document of the music of 1968 and in many ways is the sound of the culmination of the 60's.  Notorious is an important record that fell flat due to the cover and the marketing.  The music inside is a treasure trove.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love this app and that it's for the most part free! Fun for the whole family! Great game for all!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|There couldn't be a better movie made in this era in this date and time both spiritual and moving and most of all loving.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Now I can watch it anywhere any time! Excellent quality. Plays perfect on my phone and iPad. I love the Amazon player.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. There wasn't any boring moment at all. It's like an American-meet-Latin-America kinda movie, very cultural and educational at the same time. I had a little inclination to visit Rio while watching this movie. The ending was a happy one and one of the ending songs is now on my playlist (Taio Cruz's \\"Telling the World\\"). It's a great movie to watch for all ages.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|Replaced stock case fans with 2 Noctuas. These are almost inaudible, especially if you choose to add in the &#34;Silent&#34; adapter (included with the fans).<br /><br />Fans installed easily, but the stock rubber mounts from my old case fans worked better than the ones that Noctua supplied. Noctua clearly states that this may be true for some installations right in the directions.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a very addictive game. It is very easy to play, yet challenging! I would recommend this game to all my friends.
0887431453|5.0|This has letters, shapes, mazes, coloring... everything you need. I totally recommend it for your preschooler! I purchased this for a daycare and the children loved using these large books!
B00181JGI2|1.0|Did not like this movie at all.  Heard good reviews about it, but it wasn't my cup of tea.  Thanks
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you're a fan on of the genre (you've seen both Iron Man movies, Thor and Captain America) and you didn't greatly abhor any of them then you will probably like this movie.  It's fun, it's witty and most importantly it's entertaining.
0307352153|3.0|It took me a long time to get through this, but as a teacher and a parent, I really felt like it was a must.  It brings up many interesting things to think about regarding the way that information is received and processed by an introvert vs. an extrovert.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Witty and sweet. This was a terrific movie, even for adults! Looking forward to the next one -- great voice work.
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|While the premise of the show is based on someone who is getting away with pretending to be a lawyer, while being  a fraud but at the same time refreshing and green and out shining the. &#34;Real&#34; lawyers. .  But as the story continues the story line has faded more into the back stabbing under handed side of the law.  It has lost it's fresh element.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this, probably too much! I do like that they can build imaginary worlds and play with friends on the same network when visiting. If you get this game for your children, make sure you limit their daily time on it or they'll be on it all day!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I bought this video for my granddaughter who is 2 1/2.  She really likes the &#34;Simba&#34; movie. She always asks to see it when she visits.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|If you have issues with struggling to take chances, fear or failure then this book can give you a new perspective that will improve you outlook and ultimately your life
B00999DFP0|5.0|this is the complete  up to the last season. and does have all the shows and is in English as stated
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book had me hooked from the very second I started reading it. If only there were a man like Christian Grey out there!
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|This show is great. Good story lines great actors<br />Just watched first two seasons and was worth the time watching the third season now
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not too dark, but a little edgy.  Lots of cultural references and humor, and I love the chemistry between all the cast.
140006922X|5.0|Well the publicity and controversy got my attention - and this is a subject of considerable interest to me, i.e. the society under which Christianity emerged. The talented and surely erudite author even made those amazing footnotes exciting- which revealed even more, and different perspectives. Aslan loves his subject, and the storytelling is extremely engaging, and given the topic, \\"an important issue.\\"<br /><br />Three areas were especially compelling to me: 1) Although one of the last topics, it is fascinating, and heartbreaking, to see how Paul, IMHO, a devious, egotistical, arrogant anti-Semite (and former Pharisee),<br />was clearly a heretic. And, as described in Acts, was disloyal, to James. What ego, without any proof and having never met Jesus. 2)  And I knew this, but it is still a sensational issue, none of the Gospels were written<br />for at least twenty years after Jesus had died (why bother when the kingdom of heaven was about to begin?). And those endless contradictions make the phrase \\"gospel\\" an embarrassment. And that none of the Apostles<br />actually wrote the chapters.  And that Mark never mentions the resurrection (as almost all scholars believe the last chapters were added much later). 3) Sadly, the promises Jesus made never came true. He failed in the three major areas he vowed to bring.  Alas.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr Aslan, for a superb book on an evolving topic!
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This is just too cool for words.  So much faster then a traditional app calculator.  Love how it fills in the missing numbers for you.  My 10 year old daughter even liked it and she is far from a math fan.  Amazon really needs to get the rights to the memo/note taking ones too.  2thumbs up
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I would recommend this game to everyone-young and old alike. I really like this game and I find it very amusing.
1623420148|5.0|I loved reading Tangled!!!  The story is contemporary, written with humor and a very sexy. I highly recommend this book!!!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Anyone interested in astronomy will love this app. Good information with it. I showed this one to most of my friends.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|Amazon should request reviews sooner after purchase as this lightweight had almost passed from memory, although I do recall disturbing my wife by repeatedly muttering &#34;crap&#34; and &#34;@#$%&#34;.  Where has the John Grisham that once wrote gripping (albeit formulaic) stories gone?  Replaced by a ghostwriter whose young protagonist makes more poor decisions per hour that your average adult lawyer putting him under suspicion of a criminal charge we just know won't ultimately stick. To figure out who is perpetrating the setup we have to know information that isn't revealed until the final pages making this less of a whodunit and that a whydIbother.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Yes, a time gone by but still elegantly relevant. Pace well, acted superbly, laced with humor and wisdom.<br />Harvey reminds us our vital our imaginations are and underscores that kindness trumps all else.<br />A blessing on celluloid.<br />Watch it once a year--at least.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Love the fairly minimal style. Date is a feature I didn't realize I'd appreciate. Self winding is hard not to like. Looses maybe five minutes a month. Stayed wound for three days after I took it off. Fits well on a slender male wrist.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful app.<br /><br />i do use everyday.<br /><br />Would be totally lost with out this app.<br /><br />Also, have it set up to share files with my family.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love all of the angry birds - angry birds with friends is great too<br />Love to play them all !!
B00CDT41RY|2.0|My humble opinion.<br />Almost as lame as the original Italian series of Djangos in the Sixties.<br />And Leonardo Decaprio? Give me a break. Mandingo is the one to see<br />if you want to watch these historical fantasies. That one was the best<br />of the best. Miscegination, canabalism, brutality, murder, fake tenderness<br />all there up on the screen. And even James Mason degrading himself.<br />Julian Wasser
0385512104|5.0|GREAT SHAPE MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE BOOK, HE NEEDED IT FOR SUMMER READING AND I FOUND IT HERE AWESOME :)
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love everything about it. Great  humor for any age group. Nice animation and funny characters.  Looking forward to see the 2nd part.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Best alarm I've ever used.<br />The random song by artist function is wonderful.<br />The slow fade in to wake is excellent and a must. Haven't found any other that works as well.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|Awesome set of DVD's! This show is great! I would recommend it to anyone interested in a hilarious comedy! Must buy!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Many people are turned away by, \\"Oh, it's just a movie about video games.\\" No, it's about video games like Toy Story is about toys - it is simply a context to set a wonderful story in. I love Wreck-It Ralph - it is my favorite thing to come from Disney since The Avengers.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|Was not sure the second time that I had seen this movie a couple of years ago but I enjoyed it more the second time.  It is similar to the Oscar winner &#34;Crash&#34; in that it shows the tragic perspectives and prejudices of privileged and poorer societies on 3 different continents which are brought into collision with each other as the result of a single stray bullet.  Strangely enough, there was at least one actor from Crash who had a role in this movie as well.  I highly recommend it!
0679720200|4.0|Classic book.  Not interesting, but educational.  I don't think you have a right to require me to write more words than apply to my assessment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This the best game ever at first it seams like nothing but once you start it is the best ever five stars no problem.
B0013ND30M|4.0|Sleeping Beauty is the end of the Golden Age of Disney feature length cartoons.  Walt was busy with other non-cartoon projects at the time the studio was making this catoon and this shows in the final product.  The story is slight compared with other Disney classics of the 1950s such as Cinderella and Peter Pan.  Walt ordered a different type of art to be used in this film and it does have a very different look than other Disney feature length cartoons.  Still, this film is a classic- I remember watching it when the movie was released and loving it.  Highly recommended.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|My parents partly got me my kindle so I didn't have to take their phones.  candy crush is my favorite game.  I don't need help playing it.  I want to play the game on my kindle.  lots of the time I don't get to play when I want to.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This Book Was Great. Kept Me Changing My Theory Initially. I Really Like How Everything Unravels At The End Of The Story.
B00008IHN1|5.0|This is an excellent film! My 5 yr old niece absolutely loves it! This movie keeps her busy, and she has learned the entire plot line.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|My 4th Ken Follett book and I can't get enough! The characters are fascinating. Looking forward to the next book.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I'll admit to coming across this book after watching the Netflix show. Certainly, I knew that was sensationalized and the real Piper's story was much more subdued... But this book was still disappointing. While her journey and insights were interesting, Kerman writes in a way that never draws you in. They say when you write you should show your readers, not tell them. Unfortunately, this book felt like 200+ pages of being told, with disjointed attempts at showing. And while it followed the linear timeframe of her sentence, I felt the book lacked any real arc or theme to make it more than a compendium of delayed and analyzed blog entries.<br /><br />I feel like I'm being a jerk, but I'm really not trying to. The bonus is the attention this book is drawing to the prison system and the dialogue that's happening around the show- these are important conversations for us to be having as a society.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was unexpected.  It was a departure from many of the books that I have read recently,  but contained the elements that always make a good book:  Solid plot, drama and some other world elements.  It was a creative and compelling read which kept me engaged from the beginning to the end.
B00CDJNHH4|5.0|Transfer on this flick is just AMAZING, done in great JOB & is in 2:35 ratio wide screen ..The way should be..lQQks soooo CLEAN SHARP ,CRISP & VIVD in colors in my HUGE screen room ..Beautiful transfer, Superior JOB they did on this blu-ray ..THANK YOU & that's why I ordered it & worth every penny!<br />About the movie ...don't need to say much, U know whats up..Is the classic well done amazing JAWS movie EVER MADE TILL NOW HANDS DOWN & must have in ur collection >> A+
6305313687|5.0|This movie is a great (albeit dramatized) look into one of the most prominent racist groups in America.  The story will sink in and stay with you long after the credits end.  Having read numerous autobiographies of racists who have turned their lives around, this movie definitely hits the mark based on how people get involved in these groups in real life.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this film!
B0012TWRAO|2.0|I'm not sure if this is a used product or if it was manufactured that way.  A picture for reference:<br /><br />[...]
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|its a nice looking case. simple classy and soft. fits well and not bulky. it protects for scratches but not total protection like the impact of a drop. another flaw would be the strap that keeps cover closed might stretch out over time.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Best alarm clock out there love the increasing alarm levels and choosing my own sounds<br /><br /> Great great great<br />Best best
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book captured the internal and external emotional conflicts that can be divisive to families and parents when trust becomes compromised.  The author does a great job portraying the complexities that can arise in the various relationships (husband/wife, children/parents, children/friends).  I enjoyed the suspense, the plot and would highly recommend this book for those who enjoy drama and suspense.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this appnand the weather channel app. I like this one best because all the info I want is on one page.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This book was very well written and I think that students students all over the world should have these. Peace!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I just started but I can already tell I am going to love it there is just so much you can unlock and do that I don't think the game will ever end lil yay.no more boredom
B0036UMM84|5.0|Seen this movie when I was  teenager and absolutely loved it, now I'm glad it is part of my movie collection.
0345529057|3.0|First of all, these stories are awesome. If I could give 6 stars for the stories, I would. Also, the price for the set was fantastic.<br /><br />However, there are about 50 pages in Book 3 that were printed incorrectly--actually, it looks like they were cut incorrectly, because the page is cut so that there is no margin on the right side and one or two letters from each line are missing. I can still read the book, but I've just never seen that in a book before.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Thankfully, Rankin has returned to continue the story of John Rebus and we discover his life in the cold case unit. His disregard for the rules is still very evident, as is his ability to close cases. Great read.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|After seeing a live performance of &#34;Singing in the Rain&#34;, I wanted to see how it followed the movie.  I had seen the movie back in the 50's and remembered the great cast and some of the dance scenes and thought it would be fun to watch it again.  The musical performance at the Zeiterion Theatre in New Bedford, MA followed the script and dance sequences to a T and I think that though it is over 50 years old, the film version would be enjoyed by everyone who likes musicals.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|It was so much fun. But not long enough for $5.00. I went through it in just a few days. The graphics are awesome and I loved all the details in each frame. Nicely done.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game! It is so much fun to try and figure out how to get out the room! I can play this game all day long I hope they have many many levels to play!!!
