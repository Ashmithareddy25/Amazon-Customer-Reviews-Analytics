B00IPS4APU|3|It works. However, the line is still visible after the treatment.
B008G28CWC|5|Very Good!
B006LO7YM6|5|Great buy
B00ABPRAN4|5|Cute.  Looks great on our car!
B002UD0GGS|3|improved the windshield on my golf cart but still leaves some scratches that can make oncoming lights hazy at night.
B00302578A|5|a new look for my Jeep they look great and I'm happy with them they aren't as dark as I like but it's all good I understand why
B00ELHTA72|5|Good price, no problems with the oil. Used on my 2013 Subaru Legacy 2.5i
B000J18RT6|3|Works but wish it had a finer point on it.  Will try trimming the fibers.
B007O1X4AQ|5|Awesome eazy install color Rich and blue
B000CITK8S|5|Great battery charger! I've been using this one for about a year and its held up great. Much better quality than some of the others on the market. Very good brand that I will continue to purchase in the future!
B006FUT0CS|4|Cleaned by car without needing water.  Not good on windows as it leaves a film, though
B00LI272R8|5|Great key as nice as the factory key AAAAA+++++
B0035B04HA|5|I have them on all the vehicles I own. They look great!
B001RJOP5Y|5|works great for the money
B007Q10HAO|5|It proprietary, so no choice on the brand.  Amazon had the best price by far.
B001TLC12E|4|high quality easy to install
B00407WNE0|5|Perfect fit! Thank you!
B000EDSSDY|4|It's a decently little level. Nothing spectacular.
B00CVFIIZG|5|Very satisfied with the product, packaging, and promptness of delivery! This is a wonderful product that will protect my keys from scratches, nicks, or drops. The product looks exactly how it is shown in the pictures and fits my key like a glove. Thank you so much!!
B00SM0PDPM|5|Perfect easy to install lights up like a ball field.  Bright white light. Looks like daylight
B00KDJNRDA|1|It fit in the factory holes but I was very disappointed it completely blew out in the first week.
B00BL56HXM|5|Easy to use
B0027UMVQC|5|It fit the standard bolt pattern on my Polaris Sportsmen 800 just fine.<br /><br />  I used this new fairlead with a strap, from a tie down, for plowing.  I got sick and tired of the wire cable kinking and breaking when using my plow.
B003JLDQNK|5|This is my second Mototrek 14 Tank bag.  Love the fit on my 2012 Suzuki V-Strom.  The original faded and finally the zipper broke.  This one appears to have improved zippers.
B00FOKONJ0|1|I just received my leather recoloring balm and immediately used it on my sectional sofa.  I cleaned the leather as it says and applied the balm as the instructions indicated.  However,  the balm did not work at all.  Previous review stated that it will stain your hands and even your stainless steel sink when trying to clean up product....  That was not the case in my experience.  I will have to find another product, one that actually does what it's supposed to do.... Recolor/restore faded leather.
B004GA1LE4|5|fast service and great price
B00JDPZPTY|4|It works gtreat if only ot can be 2&#34; taller
B00HS5DRG4|5|Love the bumper guard for my 2014 Highlander. Fits perfectly and arrived quickly and damage free.
B00JH32YAU|1|It's pretty good but the bottom clips suck. they made cheap they broke right off. So I replaced team with two clips from home depot and it works just fine.
B0007N20GM|5|Works like a charm very good
B00ML7DIJA|5|These LEDs are perfect for reverse lights.  The projector lens on top of the LED will focus and projector the light out.  Also, the LED is built with the brightest chips available, 5730s.  I am using these on my F150 for reverse lights and they sine brightly through the smoked plastic lens of the tail light.
B00I4IJLGY|5|I purchased this LED bulb to replace an original 500w incandescent bulb installed at deep end of my 45 ft by 14 ft swimming pool.  This PAR30 45w LED bulb is very bright and its directional bluish light beam illuminates entire pool (see attached photo).  The original 500w bulb only lighted up half the pool.  On the website, it claims a 60,000 hours lifespan, but I doubt the built-in high speed cooling fan could last that long.
B00JM22B4U|5|very good fit easy to install
B000CQOIVO|3|Trailer is hard to maneuver if the stand is elevated in any way. When the wheel is jacked up the stand is at an angle which makes pushing the trailer difficult.
B006B281J8|1|these pads may perform just fine, but shame on Amazon as they most certainly do not fit the calipers on the 2006 Multistrada 620 Dark. They are about 1/8&#34; too wide to drop in to the retainer bracket.
B0006PJJC4|4|Advertised as blue but sent white. No biggie, works the same either way.
B00AQAQI6E|5|this product is really great. makes me want to purchase another pack next week .thanks!
B00032K9RO|1|Like others stated, this frame is too small for my illinois license plate...the white edges of the plate stick out and show. Am returning.
B0076MBLKS|5|Great product and price.
B00T0MRUYS|5|Epic cool
B005FNKSMW|4|Took a little while to come in but the product was packaged well and it fits perfectly to get our little red power wheel driving again!
B00KNMKRU8|5|Used this charger with a AGM battery for my trolling motor over the last few months.  This charger seems to know whats it's doing.  Initially going to full charge of 15 Amps, then backing down slowly until going to float(maintain) state.  LED keeps you informed.
B00ICV9S98|5|The are as pictured and fit well. I'll update later as to how they hold up to the weather once they have been on my car and truck a little longer.
B00789Y98K|5|I've been a automotive finish enthusiasts for 30+yrs. I've used a bunch of different waxes in that time and frankly 99% of the time you get exactly what you pay for. And diffrent waxes tend to be engineered for different strengths. IE cheaper spray waxes tend to be quick and easy with short lasting results.  More expensive paste tends to require more skill and effort to apply but the results last longer with a much deeper gloss.  Enter Yellow Wax Paste.  Pros: Gloss comparable to $60+ waxes.   For paste the application is fairly easy   Durable finish   Smell is not overpowering  Cons: Can be hard to remove if left too long   No applicator included   Builds up in edges and corners if not careful   Gloves should be worn till your used to working with it. Avoid coating your hands  The wax is an outstanding value. It behaves like a much more expensive wax. And even for a paste its not an overwhelming task.  There's a learning curve. If you apply and buff too soon it will haze again requiring a second buff. If you wait to long the wax will set hard and can be very difficult to remove. Let's be honest everything including this wax leaves scratches on your vehicles finish. It's how those scratches are arranged and how fine they are that brings in the final result. With proper application this wax gives amazing results.  I clay and wax every 3months. I do not use a mechanical buffer. I do not use a mechanical applicator. I do sponge foam apply thin coats (2) and remove with a micro fiber. I hand buff with a new flannel polish cloth. The car pictured is 4yrs old and garage kept. It does sit outside during the work day. As your viewing it the application is 1mo old, maintained with quick detailer/micro fiber and buffed with flannel.
B00N509LIE|5|Just what I needed for my car.
B00KTHWHF0|3|Works great and it is a great color, but the lock symbol is already fading off two months later.
B00XZ9OU2M|5|Works great-programs in about 2 minutes.
B000C9O1XQ|5|Great item and quality!
B00U1OLGCQ|3|These are very light-weight in construction compared to my previous tags. The embroidery is very clear to read. They are good enough but I do not know how long the lighter material will last.
B00RU6LSK8|5|I used to buy any sponge at Target, Walmart or whatever store I happened to be at when I needed a new sponge. Thought they were all the same. I have bought $2, $10, $20 sponges and never notice a difference. Until now, this sponge and mit is amazing! Mit holds lots of soap and water so you dont have to dip it over and over, scrubs great and seems to very well made. Definitely never thought I would be so enthusiastic about a car wash sponge until this.
B001S80ZV2|5|Prefect fit, and works great.
B00EDEEOT2|4|Holds hood up very well could be little longer
B00K0TA7WW|5|My 2011 Subaru Outback 3.6R has 110,112 miles on it. The gas mileage was slipping a bit. I'd been averaging 26.5 highway miles per gallon, only a bit above the advertised average highway mileage. But, my Subaru had consistently been averaging over 27.5 mpg...a meaningful difference as I average about 3,000 highway miles a month. After my first 44K treatment my mileage is now above 28, better than I've had in the past 2+ years.
B00PJCV4EA|5|I bought a new car so of course I had to buy a new vinyl sticker! The package arrived quickly and with the correct order. I appreciate that they include tester vinyls, which also happen to be super cute. I would definitely recommend Yadda Yadda Design Co.
B00GJLYN9I|2|The bars on the carrier are too far apart to allow the wheels of both my wheelchair and my scooter to roll, as the wheels fall between the rungs, making it impossible to load or unload either. This is useless as a mobility vehicle carrier unless floorboards are added on both the ramp and the carrier cage.
B000VEDEKS|5|worked perfect good quality
B002XPEO7A|5|A+
B00LXKYA0C|4|The mirror arrived and works very well.  Only complaint is that the product arrived with one of the clips that attaches it to the old mirror broken.  It stays up alright,  but I would rather it be a bit more secure.  Sight-wise, the mirror works great, I just docked the score for arriving damaged.
B00CGTVCIC|5|Better quality than I thought it would be. Love it.
B00FEXCV1E|5|I have had this in my car for a long time and was scared of buying it. I got a $100 gift card from work and decided to blow it on this. I was pleasantly surprised. I sanded, primed, and painted it and it's ready to go on my 94 rx7.
B000BOALF4|5|An auto insurance company did a study and it showed these help stop deer hits. It helps so much a big shipping company put them on all of there long haul trucks.
B00063Y3TK|5|Perfect thanks
B00H84PNFS|5|A+
B00YFNLFX4|4|Husband was pleased!
B009FU6WOO|5|Went on easily.
B000WJA5ZY|5|Good, durable RAM product.
B00B1ZEDB0|5|Great design and good size for my back car windowl
B000GOJW9A|5|Plug and play replacement for 1996 Honda Accord. Worked as advertised and arrived in original packaging. Good quality, comparable to OEM
B00NLMD6L4|5|Great item.  Performs as advertised.  Keeps the sap and bird do-do off my car.
B00QK411AS|5|I ordered these on Friday and received them on Monday via regular USPS.  If you have a German car you know of the windshield wiper fitment issues.  Anyway these came out of the box with the proper adapter and fit right into my stock 2012 Volkswagen Passat wiper arms.  I'll definitely purchase these again.  You can't find any better quality teflon coated wipers for a cheaper price.
B00S1U5TWA|5|Excellent product..
B000BPUTDW|5|Excellent
B000RZPNOQ|5|With a little bit of time and elbow grease, this stuff works like a charm!!!  It works instantly on contact so you gotta move fast.  We did a few coats on all the areas of our boat because it needed it but man it's like new!!!
B000IY8P7I|4|Fit my 2006 Volvo S60 perfectly.
B00O5UFNEO|5|Item is as advertised it fits my bike and best of all folds up small enough to actually fit in carrying case
B001TK0DSY|5|This soap leaves an impressive glossy finish on my black yukon which seems to last for a week or better. The soap seems to help loosen bugs and grime from the paint with little needed elbow grease, also.
B005EV1W6Q|1|I followed the directions and in only three days, the wind pealed it off.
B003S1RQ2S|5|good product.
B00WKL1DXU|2|on size listed
B008SEBQ2G|2|too short bad reception ordered a longer one see if it works OEM slaps the garage door.
B00802GIW4|5|Easy to install very fast shipping
B008F8Q8K0|5|Installed on my dad's Suburban in minutes. It's incredible how easy it is to replace the entire headlight assembly on a modern vehicle. The Suburban just has one large L-shaped pin this is removed, allowing the old assembly to be pulled out. An easy 15-minute swap. These units even came with high- and low-beam bulbs.
B004AGCBZW|5|Did the job, good product but not easy to replace on my Express.
B001O0AG4U|1|Arrived broken
B007ZD1XK6|5|Outstanding Product.
B005H12QXG|2|mirror is very noisy looks like glass is not recessed inside enough
B00CCSVXN6|5|Works great with my s480
B000BTO100|5|very nice
B0100WC91U|4|It was exactly what I was looking for. I was very grateful to have found it.  I understood that these wheels are not in production any longer so when I lost my center cap, I was devastated.<br />The only bad thing was that there is a huge scratch across the face of it. It is quite noticeable. I was a little disappointed with that but I kept it because I would rather have my center hub covered.to make my truck look complete.<br />Thx!
B00DHQ1ON6|5|Seems pretty sturdy.  Easy to unfold and fold back up.  It also has a nice case to put it in when folded.  I'm usually the only one in my car, so most of the time I throw the folded screen on the floor of the passenger seat.  The case stays flung on the back seat.  I don't really notice that my car is any cooler, but at least the dash is being protected from the UV Rays, which is really what I bought it for.  It fits my Pacific perfectly.
B00OK5RLMQ|5|Excellent light bar!!!!! What a difference this quad row bar makes!!! Outshines the dual row 50 inch bars. Fit on my prerunner bar perfectly!!! Power cord is 3/8 round, about 24-30 inches long. Built very well and worth the price. Arrived In about 7 days!!!!! Thought I was going to wait 4 weeks atleast.
B00FH8P1DG|5|awesome light
B00F23BNUG|5|worked great, will buy more when needed.
B001621FZA|5|Real beauty!
B00JX2TX4A|5|Love the look of the clear lens. I wish the LEDs were a little more white, they are a little blue, but that isn't a big deal.
B00BFDG4QU|5|check engine light went out within one day after putting this on.
B0021LSY8G|5|I love it! I'm a girl and I bought a small.
B007SQYSX4|5|Love my poodle decals! Look wonderful on the back window of my van. easy to apply and firm hold!
B00GSAUHB8|5|It is compact when not in use and fits fine in my BMW Z4.
B001QDHTOK|5|Great!
B00RZXVQSU|5|Love it, thanks!
B00MJUMZ66|5|GREAT product.  I have used this product for a number of years on my personal vehicles and my motorhome and it provides excellent protection, especially UV protection.  It is works wonderfully for all plastic, vinyl and rubber parts on the exterior as well as interior components, as it seems to rejuvenate them and bring back original color, especially on black plastic, vinyl and rubber components.<br /><br />Would highly recommend to a friend.
B00V9ZNEJE|5|Turns night into day
B000C59SMY|5|Drop in replacement in my '02 Chevy Venture, AWD.  Price was decent, working well so far.
B00029JMW6|5|I did not know it was plastic, but really nice
B005CQTKEE|5|Gift for my hubby
B004IE98FC|5|Excellent
B0063TV5HE|5|they work great
B00JVHLS3G|3|The logo fits,but the white part turns to yellow after few days of sunlight.
B008HZPBOU|4|Good product.
B00069CN2I|1|We tried ordering these twice and both times got 2 right hand mirrors..had to buy at a local store at double the price.
B004SH2G7G|5|fit good
B00H7LPKKU|5|works great
B008N2JKJY|5|You can't go wrong with the OEM filters. I bought it for my 2013 Genesis Sedan<br />This set contains 10 engine oil filter kits.<br />Each kit has several O-rings and the drain plug washer.<br />The price is good as well: ~8 bucks / kit.
B002BETXS8|2|hard to use properly
B00K1C1WC2|5|They do what they were made to do.
B00D29P5CO|4|Good!
B004PILLZG|5|Worked perfect
B001JT5NIU|5|Always  great product.
B00SVYKC64|5|nice
B00OP8E3N8|5|Perfect
B0076I8OPC|3|Wish I had read the prior review, I too only received one bulb.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!!!
B00DCYV0TG|5|They look great on the car! thank you!
B00SC6ZRP2|5|Made it so I could drive! Have only one arm to use due to a surgery!
B0050R9VVW|5|Has been working for over a year without any issues
B007J5ICOK|3|Very feminine cut, however, it is definitely not intended to fit much tinier or smaller-breasted women.  Those of us with a smaller waist and more well endowed will have to use vest extenders on top.
B00DI3DV6G|5|This car organizer is a great addition to my new SUV.  The compartments help to keep my groceries from rolling around the trunk and spilling all over the place.  The organizer folds up easy and has two carrying handles so I can carry everything into the house in one trip.
B005NLQAHS|4|Works well, but a bit cumbersome to pair. Still, a good value.
B000M5WT6G|1|I didn't even get the one that is display...on the picture...All I want is the one on the picture
B0089LR0T6|5|Great product
B00SX5RSA4|4|I used these to disassemble the strut assembly, then reassemble with a 2-inch spacer. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but these things are SOLID. The new Tundra 4x4 Crewmax springs are pretty beefy. The pins did not fit over the spring, but once there was enough pressure, they weren't going anywhere. I used an air impact wrench to make quick work of the job.<br /><br />It did seem as if the threaded rods bowed a bit the more you compress. I wasn't concerned that they would snap, more concerned that the threads would strip. They didn't. I don't know if i'd use them on a bigger spring, but i'm not sure there are bigger springs until you jump up to 3/4 and 1 ton trucks. It can definitely handle most, if not all, cars.
B00S4OWN6S|5|I went in search of microfiber cloths as they were recommended for my new cooktop stove. These really do the job so much better than other brands. The extra benefit I discovered was how well they clean my windows.
B006PAGJXQ|5|Good quality.  Very durable.<br />Meets a variety of needs
B0018PSASU|5|Works great. No swelling of seals either.
B0063RHGFG|5|Quality product that met my expectations. Delivered on time per schedule.
B0009IQY3U|3|Seems like it works ok with a power buffer on oxidized rv gel coat. I used this on a referral from McGuires customer support. Have since been told probally better to use cleaner wax combo. Have to use a lot of pads as it clogs them.
B000EJQJ1G|3|They don't last long but are convenient.
B0014GDGPU|5|Just as it looked nice!
B00BVB5V0Q|4|i ordered wrong color but they work
B00473W5V8|5|Worked extremely well priming the pinch weld before glass installation and was much less expensive at Amazon than at competitors. Enough primer to do one windshield or one back window and have a little left over for a second coat if you missed a few spots on the first one.
B00IF9KATO|5|Awesome! !!
B00KTIYXLU|5|Great price! Fast Shipping.  Thank u
B003CJJVPG|4|have not yet but looks good
B00PGCDFH2|5|The install was quick and easy.  The running boards arrived on time with all required hardware.  These boards were exactly what I was looking for.  They have a clean and sleek look to them.  The price was the best I've seen.
B00CB8WM2S|5|I haven't had to use it yet, thank God, but from the feel of it, it's VERY solid and looks like you wouldn't want to be a window on the business end (both of them) of this life hammer! It's small enough to fit into my small Coach, so anyone can carry this with them!
B00GSG652C|5|loved it!!
B000ONZXPK|5|good
B0080HJL7S|5|Very stiurdy and nice looking large enough to cover car garbage and not see it all over the floor. Received for review.
B00BITKO1C|4|the Tailgate handle doesn't fit like the OEM does, but it works just fine.
B006KDJUGG|1|did not fit my van
B000E681FG|5|OEM replacement assembly fitted perfectly.
B00NXRYMSI|5|good
B0087NAWYQ|5|Love these!!!!
B0003040ZS|5|Great experience with this purchase. All came as advertised and in a timely manner. Very satisfied with this purchase.
B00N40BR82|5|great price. worked great on my front bumper and for my tree strap for my winch.
B00D38PGKK|4|The product was OK, but keep in mind: it's pink, it wont stay pink long.
B0085BS8Y6|5|Looks clean & very bright...better then those $80 bulbs from your local auto store & the deep yellow matches my theme...ill post a pic later
B00JRE38EA|5|2015 Toyota Tacoma.  I installed these in my map lights, third brake lights and license plate lights.  So far after a week I love these!  Even though two out of the pack did not work, these are still a fantastic value!
B002P8CIIW|1|Horrible,The connector wasnt the same and they didnt align with the Factory Holes
B0058J4M5C|1|Does not fit 1997 GMC truck .
B00CWNBCUU|5|Absolutely loved the stickers went great on our Honda :)
B001KQR4DY|4|Nice reman caliper.
B004OI7HA0|5|worked well, covered well, seems to be holding up very well. I got the tan color and like the looks of it. I put it in the tub of a jeep YJ while I had everything disassembled for a rebuild. I plugged all the holes with foam caulk before spraying and they cleaned out well when I unmasked everything. Make sure to buy and use the Al's Mold Release Agent.
B00NQ6GITW|5|I used to use this wax when I lived in CA and can't say these smell exactly like that but they smell good and last waaay longer than tree air fresheners. Coconut is definitely my favorite.
B000C7ZFB0|5|Fit great, no more EGR code.
B00G35ST2W|5|A+
B00HZ414IQ|5|I bought this part and installed it a week ago. I read some reviews and most sounded good with a couple of complaints about leaking. The quality of this part is not as good as the original but totally usable for a replacement. The inlet tube is not the same diameter as the original but not a problem. It was delivered in 3 days which was great. I bolted it on with the original screws because on an XR100 the new bolts are to long on one side and you cant get a wrench on them. I looked into trading the face plate with the old one because it doesn't have the any of the engraved words like the original, but to much work I think for a $25 part. Anyway glad to say the replacement works totally great. I cant see why it would leak if its installed correctly. The bike we fixed with this is running better than ever. I would totally recommend this part rather dealing with Honda, paying double and waiting 3 weeks.
B004BC983S|5|Bought for my in-laws. They say it fixed the problem and they can see at night again, so that's great.
B001NJ3H0C|2|Expected life is 3-5 years.  It failed after 16 months, which is just past the one year warranty.
B003VLBPJA|3|it's ok, will hold things down on bike but hooks come off way to easy, already lost 2 hooks, need to crimp them down better before using.
B0057WNZNA|5|Doesn't take off when it is too hot
B0015PN010|5|This is a great tool.  A must have for anyone that's regularly working on suspension components.  Allows you to correctly separate the ball joint without damaging the boot or bolt threads on the joint.  A+++
B00OPZCMMA|5|Great product!
B004HA8YSY|4|For my 2002 Jeep Wrangler Tj, The lights are nice, no instructions, wires are a little short slightly lower quality, but does look super nice! Gets in the way of stock license plate cover, but I will be replacing it anyway.<br /><br />The way I wired it on my jeep is<br />Drivers side<br />Yellow/black= running lights wired it to black on tail light<br />Red/green= brake lights wired to green cable on tail<br />Passenger side<br />Yellow/black=running lights wired to black tail<br />Red/black= brake lights wired to green<br /><br />White is ground and needs to have a good ground to the car itself.<br />Purple/black is reverse light on both sides, these tai lights do not have reverse so I did not wire.<br />Lights work great, will blink faster if you do not by an alternator for them due to the bulb to led convert, hope this helps.<br />I
B007VR7AF8|5|Used these to help hold up our  fold down top on our Argo 8X8. They clamped down on the 3/4&#34; tubing and will keep the cover up and tight with all the bouncing around. Works very well.
B0001XPCCC|1|I had to return this license plate frame because the plastic screws were so brittle, they snapped off as soon as I attempted to install it.  Happened to almost every screw and it wasn't due to over-tightening.  I barely would begin screwing them in and they just broke in half.  Garbage.
B006S4WU50|5|I love it!
B009D35VPE|5|Perfect.  Just what I needed.
B00M9MRA14|2|I installed the PDM60 on my Honda NC700x.. It controls my Garmin, heated grips and a accessory connection.  It has been s little difficult to program .  You program without power but it has to be wired up to check .  Read all the directions and make notes.  Mine went out around a year old on a trip. I emailed the tech email given and over two weeks later no response .  I like the concept and may try again unless I find something better.
B000BO71M0|5|Very red, very reflective, easy to work with (I trimmed mine into a design before sticking it to a curved surface - no complaints).
B00IJGQ1BO|5|My black Lexus carpeted floor mats look terrific in my light gray 2006 RX-330.  Seem to be excellent quality and they instantly enhanced my aging interior.  The car even smells much cleaner inside after replacing my original mats!
B006N9392I|5|Fixed all my problems.
B002ICAN9G|5|Very good quality item great seller!
B008VQ13Z6|5|Perfect replacement for my missing windshield wiper knob on my 75 Ford custom
B000B8N3J6|5|It works, that's all I wanted.
B00YT78NZE|2|Not as good of a quality; you get what you pay for I guess. I replaced all six of these on a Buick Enclave, 2009. I was unable to start after I did the replacement, so I had it towed to a shop. The shop said the starting circuit fuse had blown, and after troubleshooting, one of the new coils was burned out. I did not save any money by doing this myself. And, as of this date, 8-24-15, my vehicle still runs rough, and I know it is still the same problem. After pay day, I will put the car in the shop and see if I need to replace any more of these &#34;new&#34; &#34;cheap&#34; coil packs.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy the higher priced, hopefully better quality part. I did not get a deal on this.
B0054R9Y3S|4|Used it over my two weeks of vacation to the mountains. I loved it and only having to carry one helmet. When it was really hot the vents weren't very helpful. I can't wait to get the bluetooth system for it and try it out.
B008XCF72I|2|Stock headlight was brighter!!! Only reason for two stars was because they look great. Oh and the &#34;halo&#34; is dim ccfl and you can't see it
B004SSEF56|5|good around neck, bit short
B00WOAQXQO|5|Easy enough to install of you have any mechanical ability. Gives my turbo the air it needed to release the hounds!
B0072W5PFO|5|Headlights are great and shipped fast ! Thanks
B00OSZPIXM|5|Excelent
B00DNX92TQ|5|Great tank bag!!! I use it for my lunch bag
B00M76FSH0|5|Nice decal.
B00L2DATVO|1|wrong ones.
B00FMPS1O0|1|Almost all mounting straps failed after a few days in desert almost leaving me stranded.
B00C6MVO0A|5|satisfied
B002OW5J44|3|Great product, but without knowing it, our 2015 Heartland trailer has a new &#34;Dexter&#34; style vent which has mounting brackets molded into their vent which conflict with the MaxxAir mounting.  I had to cut these brackets off so the MaxxAir II brackets would fit.  I hope MaxxAir can add a second set of brackets to their install kit to address this in the future or offer an option to order alternative brackets on initial order.
B00LNIPAIU|5|Great accessory for my 2006 Mazda 3 , the color and material fit great with the car. Easy to self install.
B008BC8G7S|5|Very good product
B00UAH8UZK|1|garbage, looks like cheesy piece of metal hanging from the car
B005DJNJ3S|2|It wasn't this design as advertised. It was a shark decal but more of a outlined version of what was shown, wasn't solid lime pic
B001KSDZOY|3|Great piece.  shock had more movement that it should have.
B002UC6NFM|5|These work perfectly for replacement bulbs inside our 1998 Itasca motorhome.  None of the bulbs was broken in shipment.  We are very happy with this purchase.
B00496RE82|5|Works great for my application. Easy to install.
B00I96JZU8|5|Fully charged and ready to install once arrived
B0084UJKCC|4|These were very easy to install and they look great on my 2013 F-250. I think it would have been better if they were provided with self locking nuts to prevent the bolts from working loose and falling out.
B005K0235K|5|Great idea and good quality
B005BNP7UO|2|When plugged in to Escape it caused the turn signals to go crazy so I cut wires and just use it as a hitch protector. looks good anyway
B002E2WMWG|5|Have had these installed for a year. No problems, no faults. Installed on my 2013 Subaru Legacy. They are on most nights (probably 90% of the time that i've have them)
B0002JM69W|1|Fell apart right away.
B00ICKS9NU|1|These do not thread onto the tie rod arms properly.  They do not work.
B0015CIWZ2|5|Fit perfectly on my 2003 Lexus RX 300. Thank you!
B005FKB9FA|5|Awesome product/awesome price. Great service.
B004GDT04E|5|Perfect fit on my '07 Explorer. By far the cheapest place I found it!
B00QSBDOG2|5|Good clutch for the price.
B013QAQSOM|5|NICE LOOK. AND STRONG RUBBER! LIKE IT
B002G29KLK|5|Ok.
B004A2WXWW|5|Nice dome light use it in my camper all the time works very nice the switch works well I would recommend it
B00CWQ8QD8|5|best sticker ever
B00QFY2BCK|1|This product did not work.  Lenses still foggy. Used as directed but no change to the head lights
B000CN9KB0|4|WINDOW SHADES ARE REALLY EASY TO PUT IN AND CUTS ALOT OF NOISE THANK YOU
B000V5SP92|5|good power and mileage
B001N74DDY|3|It works, but I'm not a huge fan. It is a pain to use and it stabs into my tires a little more than I prefer.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Easy to use, gave me the codes and coupled with an app on my phone I can see lots of information.
B003H6SPZG|5|It worked great fit perfect and tag looks good on the front of my truck
B004SX5HNA|3|The lights are bright and easy to install. They brackets rust fairly quick.
B00HSWC8EY|1|Forego buy a paint pen and instead go for a bottle of paint with its own brush. Most internet site warn that these pens dry out way too quickly and I was only able to get about 10 seconds worth of very thin coats before it went dry. The color match is also better with a brush.
B0033XXXG4|5|Great item worked great.
B00396JQUC|5|very good
B00BXLEI2G|5|Great ramps. Works well with my Silverado and Sportsman.
B00HU8Z96K|5|SuperBly extraordinaire
B00BJF0CK8|5|perfect replacement for 2011 mini cooper.  easy replacement.
B0068FZ4PM|3|Nice cover.  However, there are two elastic straps one on each side with metal hooks.  The elastic is stitched to hold the metal hooks.  The stitching has come undone since purchase two or three weeks ago.
B00LACAP02|5|Love it! Even bought some for my friends who are breastfeeding also!
B000JD4SPQ|5|This works great on our 2009 Frontier pickup using the Hopkins 47635 Plug-in Simple Brake Control cord. I already had a 2 relay tail light control on the truck  by the passengers door behind the kick wall. They plugged right in, 15 minute job there. That goes to the electrical plug, I believe they prevent the tow vehicle from blowing the fuses on your tail lights if something goes wrong with it.
B00VPHZ2A0|5|all was good
B00HVJ899C|5|Love this gel seat cushion.  Got it for long road trips to Florida, etc, and have not yet used it for that.  But, I can tell just using it for short trips that it's going to be great.....
B00U24MEQC|2|they were cool easy install i bought them in april and they burned out by august
B00UJF4EDK|5|Perfect bulbs.
B00JQ5RYKY|2|Works well, but installation instructions are terrible.
B009C4LBL2|5|Great for the money.  Open boot sole allows for great traction at stop lights etc.  CHECK SIZING!  No complaints here.  We ran through lots of rain on last Iron Butt ride.  They worked exactly as they should.  Do not hesitate to buy for this money.
B00K326BY4|3|The air fill up nozzle went bad couldnt close after using the blaster once.
B001DASP26|4|Replacing the original in my 2004 GMC Sierra 2500HD 4dr Long bed Duramax. Seems fairly sturdy.  The studs are slightly wider than the stock mounting holes, but easy to fix.  The bearing fit over the driveshaft well.  Has a &#34;made in Israel&#34; sticker on it. The bearing in the center is an EBI bearing (made in China). Time will tell for durability.
B00CCZ15XW|5|Shield is very clear, but scratches easily like the other reviewers have said.  However, when all other options are triple the price, you can't complain.
B00BPEOE1G|1|I purchased this item expecting it to replace the grill that is existing on the front of my vehicle as is pictured in the photos for this product. This grill mounts on top of your existing grill and looks pretty stupid if you ask me. Also this won't fit your vehicle with the front license plate bracket still on the car, the lower insert won't fit unless you remove the bracket. Fit and finish is nice but I wish it would have been pictured as a grill cover instead of a replacement grill. Now I have this item that I don't even want to use
B003CH577Y|5|Worked well and pads stick to it fine. Fit my porter cable tool.
B001CA6KYM|5|I changed out the lower ball joints on my 2006 Liberty CRD with these as I did my lift. I got a set of JBA upper control arms which come with new ball joints so I decided to do the bottoms while I had the front end apart. So far so good, they seem much more robust than the stock ones and have a grease fitting so they can be kept up.
B004JKSW0M|3|IT WORKED, WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY
B00VA7Y5PI|5|Very loud exhaust but still love it
B001OMEPEU|4|Good replacement. Sits out about an eighth of an inch further than OEM sealed beam. Glass lens, rubber bulb socket cover on the back.
B006CQF45C|5|Bought this for my 2013 Dodge Avenger. Getting it on was a bit of a battle, but it is a great product that is functional and very well made. Fits the car perfectly. Makes me look like a douchebag but keeps the front bumper and hood of the car protected.
B000VPNGEQ|5|My husband said , It's a great hitch and easy to install. We will be using it mainly to haul our bicycles on it.
B000CMIGB6|5|Finally changed the belt on my car thanks
B0007OWD2M|5|the best glass cleaner i used
B005P9SKXA|5|Very nice product.  The screw caps make it!

B000F0QS24|5|Product was as expected, quality..!!
B005FO2R1G|5|Fits,well looks like OEM, don't know if finish will last but it looks great now.
B00LKXFN6W|5|It works and has lasted through the weather so far on my bike..
B00E63THQA|3|I really loved this bottle and used it on a daily basis for almost 1 1/2 years. Everything was great till I started noticing skunky water. I cleaned and cleaned the bottle hoping to get it back into working order, but no matter what I do, clean, sanitize, bottled water, filtered water, brand new cap, nothing worked. I finally noticed 2 rust spots emerging on the bottom of the bottle. Unfortunately it can no longer be used.
B001GJ3FIS|4|tthank you
B00LBOK8JW|5|Great lights!  Worked as described.
B008DJIPSY|5|works as advertised
B000COBK8A|4|These horns are okay, but not nearly as loud as I had hoped. Good build quality though.

B00HEB2XEO|5|Worked perfect. Saved 150 bucks for a new visor..
B00HTWNJCI|5|perfect for my 8 yr old grandson that does motorcross, the product came pretty fast, protects his neck perfect very pleased with it and the shippig

B000WMQ5D2|5|Awesome sauce for my 50cc 2t April RS 50 !!
B000S2U5XW|5|Have to give it 5 stars because its just a radio antenna mast.  It either works or doesn't!  It was recommended to be purchased with AC Delco antenna base 15829166 but after receiving it found that this mast has M6 X 1.0-6H threads and the 15829166 base has M7 x 1.0-7h threads.  I had to return it for AC Delco 22876544 mast.
B008Y56MIC|4|A bit tricky to install but with a little help from youtube its on and works.
B0007N20GM|5|Works perfect...I'm very happy I bought it..Wish I bought it sooner!!

B00G620ZVU|3|Had the lights on the truck for a few months now and they are plenty bright but already have water in them. Not sure how long they will last this way.
B003S9O3TO|5|This is the exact replacement part for my Toyota Camry at one quarter the cost they were going to charge at the dealership.  Fantastic.
B00RSOLXFM|5|EXTRA-O was very helpful when there was a problem with my order! They made it easy and their products are not expensive, but great quality! Definitely recommend!!!
B00I3JWJV8|5|It works great for me...juicy fragrance, last long ,different varieties ....
B00S4VV2JU|5|WELL MADE.  ZIPPER GOOD QUALITY.  SHOULD LAST A VERY LONG TIME.  FAST DELIVERY.
B000CB97BA|4|Been using Rancho shocks for well over twenty years now and never had a problem.  These shocks make my 2007 Silverado ride like a truck should.

B000GQ6LF6|4|Fit on my car perfect.
B00EP9BX6W|4|Looks good works great install time was 45min. The instructions were poor quality which is why I gave this a 4 star and not 5.
B00D1CQVIY|5|item as stated fast shipping
B00HJ6O4A0|4|It's a very good size for 3-4 adults to sit and relax on the beach. Folds up really nicely and is really easy to clean, must mount it down well with coolers and bags because it flies away easily.
B00T9KZ6BK|2|These light are very delicate . In order to put them in the socket, you know it takes a little bit of a grip to press and twist these type of bulbs in. Well the LED is plastic and I broke 1 and twisted the light right in half. the other I squeezed onto it and could not get it in . Maybe someone knows a trick for these??
B00H43AGLE|5|My van is one of a kind and I just went thru my first car wash today. The decal is all there and looking slick! Thank you!!
B003VAPKHE|5|The right bulbs arrived quickly.
B006H81XG4|1|Starting to fail after 2 months, disappointed.......
B000182DW4|5|Simple to install. They look good and preform well. Shipping was fast also.
B007TY9Q3C|5|Fit perfectly...and easy to replace.
B000H8VXHE|5|Works Good ill give it a thumbs up all day long. Thanks Amazon You Rock!
B00405U60A|4|Works well, fits well and folds up easily.
B000COS0GU|5|Best lugs there are. I highly recommend to everyone. Yeah they are a little pricey, but its better than a wheel flying off while drive down the interstate. Miles after miles they look brand new. I use an impact when rotating tires. A+++
B004JV6OMO|5|awesome parts
B00BCRMAAS|5|The product is not of good quality. I followed instruction to put the seat cover. But, it tore at the stitches. and also it does not fit properly both to driver and passenger seat. But, I received a good customer service from Caden
B00J9VORMI|5|Fit my Kia Sorento with no problem.
B00BITHKD2|5|Worked perfectly.
B00GKJ4P38|5|Perfect fit and looks great
B009FREAGO|5|Love it. Bought two, one as a gift and one for myself. Great value, and works as it should.
B0055DP5AW|4|good product I would recommend to a friend.
B001G7INQ4|5|Ja, plug und play. Fixen der current to the fuel pumpen. No more cranken with no vrroom. Curiously the all knowing BMW computer doesnt know when the fuel pump relay is active but isnt running the fuel pump. Anyway works perfect for my BMW X5 which has the delightful fail-at-the-worst-possible-time model in tank fuel pump and external relay with contacts that are too small for the job. Cheap fast fix the dealer would have charged a lot of Euros for.
B00SXKULY4|4|Feels great!  I have a tendency to dig my fingernails into the steering wheel, and this prevents me from doing any permanent damage.
B000NBVFN2|2|Spark plugs don´t get trapped in the tool for removal and insert. I use it in a 2009 Mustang GT.
B00KBQBDB8|1|I bought two neither pimp pulled fluid up to create siphon. No refund given
B000S345EQ|5|Great product, fantastic price.
B00318NVRM|5|Great price and easy to install in your tail light if you watch the videos on YouTube.
B004C0U2SE|5|Haven't installed but this thing is heavy duty...just like one you'd expect to find in a 50's Bellaire.
B00E6MQNMW|5|These are good grips for the price
B003YKXTV0|5|Love it, thanks!
B0009XQUKC|4|i have used this gauge 3 times and worked really well, great price and made well.
B0035X7HPK|5|Works well
B000BGM7QS|5|Perfect fit and a perfect price plus fast delivery what more could you ask?
B007OW6826|5|perfect fit replacement
B00CGTVCIC|5|Purchased two of these for our trucks.  There was no odor and it was an easy install for my son.  Like the feel of it.
B0033XXXG4|5|Jacks were easy to install. Lucky for me, my existing brackets were usable so I had no welding! Simply blocked RV and removed old jacks and replaced. Now lifts RV with ease and the independent motors are a treat for levelling.
B00KTHXZLU|5|This key fob fit perfectly for our 2004 4Runner's old key fob's hardware.<br /><br />All you do is this:<br />1. Open your old key fob and remove the parts carefully. Pay attention to how everything lines up.<br />2. Then open your new key fob.<br />3. Use all the pieces in the new key fob.<br />4. Replace all hardware as was in the previous jey fob.<br />5. Test it.<br /><br />It's that easy, and I even feel that this key fob is better than the stock one we have had with our car.
B0042XORMI|5|As Advertised
B003F8WDG8|5|I am very pleased with this purchase. Having just bought my new car I wanted to protect it from the winters here in PA. The first week I had them in it snowed, and I watched a big glop of snow and slush come off my boots onto the floor - didn't get upset because I knew that wasn't going to get soaked up by the regular floor mats.<br /><br />The slush all melted into a small puddle that stayed on top, and that later froze and I picked it out and threw back into the street. This really is exactly what you want. All the mats fit perfectly (and I mean &#34;perfectly&#34;) into place, no gaps or anything - very professional looking.<br /><br />I will forever buy these for any new car I get from this point going forward.
B000IXRMSM|5|Exact replacement.
B00FPSMW7Q|5|This helps me see my car from any distance, plus it's stayed on through all kinds of weather. It's a high quality image, and very beautiful up close.
B00VHDTM94|5|Very nice product. I love it.
B0013HP98C|5|Fit my 2009 Honda Odyssey perfectly.  I bought a used Honda Odyssey from a state that did not have front license plates so there was no bracket for a front license plate, which my state requires.  I bought the Honda factory license plate bracket and it was really floppy and was going to require me to drill a hole and put a screw through the bumper to mount it so that it was not floppy.  I did not want to do that.  This Bell bracket was the solution that has worked great.  I had to buy wide washers and nuts and longer bolts to make it reach and attached it through my grill.  There is a web forum for no-drill installations of front license plates and that is where I got the tip.  I am happy not to have screwed into my bumper.  Since I didn't actually screw into my bumper, I will have to avoid car washes with brushes to make sure that this thing stays on, but it is better to go to a brushless car wash anyways.  I did test out my normal car wash with brushes once with the Bell bracket holding my license plate and it did flip down.  Thank goodness nothing was broken or damaged, but that was a lesson-learned for me to not go there again.  If you install this license plate as it was supposed to be installed, I do not see this being an issue for you.
B001EYDSYQ|5|Works great
B00H1ES6S6|2|LED's started to come off after only a few months of use.
B00TFZNGFM|5|good price. promptly received..
B001673A8U|5|It was real easy to install by myself
B0078UAB5O|1|A got only one I order 4
B00D9C2CDO|4|Very big & well constructed. Kept everything dry when I drove in the rain. My only complaint is I wish the buckles were higher up so You could get a tighter fight.
B009XAR2CM|1|Inaccurate.  Read 35 lb on a vehicle tire when actual was 40 (verified by two different methods).<br />Oddly, read higher pressure tire (60lb) almost correctly.<br />Hose fitting to press over tire stem is very poor, impossible to get a good take the first time, every time (not easy to press over stem, takes two hands, a couple of trys and then the final reading is incorrect anyway).
B0049BV5ZK|4|This product is holding up just fine
B0065TZZQO|5|Fits perfectly works perfectly thank you
B00JGRVXVI|1|Box cakes with pieces flying around also comes only a pair
B00N5WY3CQ|5|kinda difficult to stick on all letters easily but looks and reads great

B0060A8Y0W|5|Hi quality products
B00GBVHPO6|3|these gloves get the job done but they arent the most comfortable
B00IZR6F22|5|First timeI replaced my spark plugs on my toyota venza but I'm happy I ordered this item because it works great and I didn't really have to do anything mayor to install them, just took the old ones out and installed the new ones (they were already pre gapped )...
B00AKT60UU|5|Cute!!! I just wish it smells better.
B008RTMG5S|5|Easy to install. They are very comfortable on long rides and they look great. Very nice for being a knock off brand. I do not notice much of a difference from the original Kyryakan ISO Grips besides the weight. These are a little lighter. Weight doesn't really matter considering you aren't holding these all day. Make sure you use a glue that doesn't dry really fast. That way you have a little time to make sure they are placed correctly. I would not recommend you standard Crazy Glue. I was lucky enough to have them glued in the right place. If I would have had to take another second to place them, it would have been to late.
B002NUABUO|5|very pleased
B001F7729E|5|Fixed my issue. 2000 volvo s70 GLT 2.4L 5 speed automatic transmission. Had a fault code for the o2 and replaced with Denso 234-5700. Cleared the fault code and it runs like a champ. Old o2 was shot. FYI, this is the o2 that goes after the engine exhaust manifold before the catalytic converter. Easy install.
B00D618SWC|5|Worked well
B000E2CVIS|5|Love it
B00JCFJ0VO|5|self evident, no need for bitchin.

B003V1DDK4|4|HAD TO MODIFY ONE OF THE MOUNT HOLES WITH A ROUND FILE, OTHERWISE  GOOD TO GO.
B000C9GYS6|5|Just installed, replacing partly a malfunctioning unit. The new unit is functioning as the original one when the truck was new.
B00VA0YCD0|5|Outstanding Product.
B0029EWPZS|5|Great high quality products!
B00L1FRF7Y|4|Covers nicely and it covers the tracks where the seat slides so garbage doesn't get down in them.
B00KTHUDCY|2|Disappointed in the range
B00A4OLJ48|5|I agree with what the other guy said about the hubcentricity of these.  &#34;while this ring is perfectly hubcentric, your wheels will not be anymore because they won't contact the hub lip anymore. If that's a concern, consider looking for a (more expensive) version with a lip for the wheel to sit on&#34;.  If that's not a concern for you, then you'll be very pleased with these.  Great quality, fit, finish, and price.
B009D2F5BA|5|Yes, this item fit was great, good timely delivery, ,,, Amazon yer AWSOME !
B001E2I3VQ|5|Great
B000C06JPI|5|Fit good.

B009IE2JTE|5|excellent purchase.
B00924NJGW|5|Looks great on our 5th wheel.
B00D77UCU6|5|Fit great was exactly what I needed

B000EDQR50|5|Worked great!!!
B00IO93NQC|5|very pleased with rotors and pads.  smooth and quiet.
B00F66TFH2|5|fits , easy to install and tool longer to remove old than install new. took less than 30 minutes to complete the entire job.
B00Y401JHU|3|I like this, but my only complaint is that it's so bulky it takes up too much room. I have to remove it if someone is riding in the seat it's facing.
B001PNKF2E|4|The size is great, but it's particularly sensitive to soldering heat.  2/3 that I worked on will no longer contact one or both sides after soldering.  That's partially on me, of course, but I would have liked for it to be a bit more forgiving, especially considering the $8+ price for a single switch.
B0000UUX34|5|Had on my 07 Silverado then moved to my wifes 13 Tahoe love the sound you get from it and the more responsive throttle.
B00302G7QG|5|Bought for my Fiat 500.  Good size / works great.
B005ETVO0C|5|Nice replacement for stock water pump.  This pump has aluminum impeller, even better than stock Mopar that had plastic impeller.
B004XMBXRU|5|The part was perfect. I'm very happy.
B005RZC25Y|5|Fast shipping, great price (about 1/3 the cost of O.E.M.), good fit. What else needs to be said ?
B002R0CDT2|5|fits great works fine
B00LJ19VAO|5|Easy to install and loud... great new horn
B000C04IWO|5|The photo of the product is not necessarily application-specific, meaning the one you get may look a bit different. Mine was the correct one for my car.<br /><br />Overall the product is working well after a couple of weeks' use. Installation is what I would consider an advanced-intermediate job - if you've worked on your own cars a lot and don't mind unbolting and re-bolting stuff under the hood or under the car, this is an afternoon project assuming you have the correct tools (jacks, jack stands, standard mechanic's hand tools to include sockets, screwdrivers, etc.).<br /><br />The unit is self-bleeding to a degree but I went ahead and bled the air out of the line after installation, actuated the clutch pedal several times in addition to that, and everything worked well.<br /><br />These hydraulic clutch slave cylinders are prone to leaking after a few years - doing the job yourself is definitely a money saver.
B00II5YADC|5|Love this thing. Wipes my car windows clean! Going to buy a few more for the shower doors.
B00JPJFWKK|5|If you're doing a big job or regular small jobs it's always worthwhile to buy these commodity items in bulk. These cups have clearly printed graduations in various units of measure.
B00O9ZUQV0|5|Great product!
B009Y7MJVS|5|Update - October 18, 2017<br />I've had this EZ Pass holder for over two years now and it's still working perfectly.  Sometimes in the super, extreme heat in summer the suction cup does unhook but other than that I've had no issues.  I switched from the larger, square EZ Pass to the smaller one last year and the holder still works perfectly.  I'm so happy with this purchase that I'm ordering another today to replace a different EZ Pass holder for my boyfriend (who's holder broke after one year of use!)<br /><br />I have the old EZ-Pass and it fits it perfectly.  Assembly (if you want to call it that) was super easy and it sticks easily to the windshield of my car.  It doesn't bounce or anything when driving quickly and I love not having to remember to grab the EZ-Pass when I'm going through the toll.
B006ZBPHVU|4|used on 2001 Yamaha wolverine 350
B00681BE2S|5|works great !!!!
B00M0CQD9S|5|Covers everything, leaving no black visible. I work at a Chevy dealership and I think this is better than the Putco model. Easy install, great addition for $22.
B004ZG8JL2|5|It works!  Plug and play, with little complicated.<br /><br />Directions could be a bit better, and a bit clearer.  Also, like the unit it plugs into, I'm less than thrilled about the fact that these are sealed/soldered wires onto a relay, instead of a relay socket in which the relay could be replaced.  A failed relay means replacing the entire harness you have carefully routed, trimmed, soldered and zip-tied.  But, provided it proves reliable, it is an excellent option.
B000SXCLIS|5|So far so good.  Has held up well through the last rains we have had.  Fits his 2007 Yamaha VStar 1300 perfect...Nice quality.  We live in MN so doesn't get so hot - but it has been out daily in the rain & sun since purchased...no rips or tears yet...
B00498KYQO|1|Literally a 90 degree elbow. Will NOT fit on my heater core part of the hosing. 04 MSM Miata.
B00ZVJ2YFY|5|I needed to cover my worn seats and these were just what I needed.  They were easy to install and since my back bench comes off, I was able to get it covered in no time.  My Ford Windstar seat covers are looking old and worn so when I added these covers on, it made it feel as if we got new seats, though you still feel the worn cushion when sitting on it.  There is a smell to the covers but it is not offensive or strong to me.  It actually made my van smell kind of new again.  I was weary since I had read many of the reviews and problems with fittings but in my Ford Windstar, there were no problems and it accented the interior.  Best to make sure with company that these covers will fit your particular type of vehicle before ordering.<br /><br />I received my product at a discount in return for my unbiased and honest review.
B005N6XIHS|1|xl is very small
B00A14O8LC|5|Normally I weary of Dorman products as they aren't known for having the highest quality.  This switch worked great and solved an issue I was having with my factory switch.  One of the retaining tabs did break on me, but that was after the 4th or 5th time I had removed the dash so I can't blame Dorman on that.  The color was a bit darker than my factory unit but I am not sure if that is due to the old one being faded or what.  Other than that this is a quality replacement that works like it should.
B000C57KR4|5|Installed these on a 1975 Ford Custom 2wd with 460 motor. The truck is lowered about an inch. Perfect fit. Ride is real smooth even with the drop and 50 series tires. Very happy with these and matching front shocks.
B00DZPC5NM|4|Everything was as promised
B00062YK8K|5|Just As Described
B002XL2IG8|5|Even though I returned this because I determined that it was not needed, I would buy here again.  Product arrived as promised.
B000YC9FTQ|5|Compared to others I've used, it &#34;lines itself up&#34; with the valve very well, takes an accurate reading more easily, and lets out less air while doing so. The bleeder valve is a nice touch too. Great gauge for the price.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Is a little slow to fill but for the price it's amazing. Always good to check your pressure and to have a pre-set pressure is super convenient.
B005HWW6LW|5|A+
B0089C061E|5|Have not use it yet but stays in the car. You never know when you will need it. Good to have.
B001JT5OL6|5|Good product for price. Cheaper than buying one from truck stop just had to wait for it to come in the mail.
B004AF7ELE|4|It took care of my problem and saved me a lot of money by doing it myself.
B000CK7L8C|5|Arrived quickly and fit!
B00EDFM83A|4|Fit well, good quality of light.  Will be getting another batch soon for a few more lights.
B0009JQS5S|2|I haven't installed this yet, and I think once I'm able to install it I'll be more satisfied, but it didn't come with a back so it can't be installed on my camper shell. So, that's my fault for assuming I was ordering a fully functional part, and not reading that this is only half the hardware you need to actually replace a T-handle lock. Fine. But it didn't even come with screws. Now I have to go to a hardware store and find the right sized screws too? Way too much hassle. Make sure you're reading what you're getting- this is only going to help you if you're replacing this exact mechanism and the handle is the only thing you need.
B0067UDFTA|3|this is not for a v6 fwd 2005 ford escpe
B007Y5W9RG|5|It fit and here fast an I will be back
B00SQX3KQ4|4|Looks good, but gave 4 stars only because I have not tried them yet
B00413I54K|5|Easy install.  Looks like good coverage - very secure.  Perfect fit on my 2013 F350 Platinum (no extended fender flares).  I did the front's as well.
B002XM5G70|5|Easy install as the dimensions matched the original exactly.  Also very quiet by comparison.
B00OYR83KE|4|Plugged into factory turn signal connector and work good so far.  Only issue is the double sided tape is not the best and they stick in the fairings a little more than expected.
B007PAHHWM|5|great addition to OBD2 scanner for tight places in dash.
B00HLM7G0M|5|Very bright, as bright as the deal, thanks!
B004MDTZAM|5|Outstanding Product.
B006WRVOS2|5|It does what I want, that's the important thing.
B001D228G8|3|Cheaper than my previous filter, and I can't tell a difference in the air quality compared to the previous.<br />So this cabin air filter is a step in the right direction, I think.<br />But there is no airflow direction indicator on the filter (my previous filters by other manufacturers had it), so not sure which side is up.
B00IWLKK1S|5|great
B004A30DZA|5|Fine, thanks
B00EEEB77I|5|This works great for drying cars and boats and cleaning windows.<br />As a cooling towel, it is heavy, clammy and doesn't stay cool for long.
B003WM9RZW|5|Works great.
B00A7GE75G|5|I dont think you could get more bang for your buck anywhere for a tonneua cover. This was super easy to install and looks great. I drove it 700 miles at 75MPH without in issues. It is not perfect by any stretch but if you are looking for something basic to make your truck look good and protect your groceries when you leave Costco, this is your product. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
B0027ABNUC|5|excellent quality and delivery was fast
B0013ERRSK|5|Our dog will only drink out of these now.
B000DINKPQ|5|it's not the loudest horn, but is enough
B001NZKPS8|4|Worked great, the wire was a little short for mounting to the right as much as I wanted.
B000C9OQQS|5|Great item and quality!
B0034RJ3MW|5|Very good cleaner
B00KTJ5BRE|4|Work great
B0106TA60S|4|The racks are made well but the reason I gave them a four star is because I am having to modify them to fit my jeep rails. I know it's not the manufactures fault but I can give them one suggestion, add some more rubber pieces so that one can make them fit more of a variety of rails. I've tried many different rails and these came the closest to fitting. They will fit great once I finish cutting and bending the legs of them. Sorry guys, i'm just anal about some things. No jokes about the anal please!
B002XL9FX2|5|Used to replace some broken ones in our RV and they worked great.
B00LNNR9GG|5|I always give credit where credit is due and these light are AWESOME! Very CLEAN look and match the LED headlights on my new 2016 Explorer. I've attached a few pics that will hopefully make you all decide these are the right lights for you. Pics are worth a thousands words. The difference is so clean and a perfect match in brightness and color.
B00IXUQFZ8|5|Everything I expected<br />Thank you 👍
B0019COQ6C|5|works with ease
B0002Q748S|5|quick fit, great price
B00BA761DW|1|Paid for the kit, waited two weeks and got an email that the kit is no longer being made....
B00FSAHTY2|5|Good, tight fit. Looks like it was installed at the factory.
B000CNN214|5|Very awesome mufflers. You really can't go wrong. Works best on high horsepower vehicles so don't expect a whole lot of sound under 300 horses but still sounds great! 2003 CVPI
B0058EHH18|3|Quality is a little cheaper than I thought it would be but they matched my car interior which I was happy about.
B000CJD4Z2|5|Great Japanese Quality !<br />I put 8 of these Denso (5013) MA20PR-U Spark Plugs in my 1964 FORD FAIRLANE 500 260 ci V8 engine.<br />Engine runs way better ,faster response and smoother than with the rusty Autolite spark plugs i had before .<br />Highly recommend these Denso MA20PR-U !
B009QUAWAS|3|It worked and covered my XM radio antenna.  Paint match well..  Cheap little light on end of the shark,  I broke the light off and used touch up paint.
B001QVF7IM|5|Easy on, easy off. Looks great.
B00W8U1TUA|5|just as described worked well no complaints
B008Y5ANSW|4|Pretty nice, looks goods on my bike. Didn't come with nuts to install them tho
B00XZ9ONT2|5|Ther
B00R97VN44|1|They should say it made from Chaina here in Amazon
B001B7A2OU|2|I bought this brand because of the other reviews, and am glad I did. The installation went smoothly and was a good fit. Seems well made, very similar to the OEM blower in looks and weight. The CFM seems about the same too. It might be a tiny bit more noisy. I had noticed a slight whine at lower speeds, but that doesn't happen so much now. Perhaps there is a break in period?  2/26/2017 update: Downgraded to two stars. Just over a year after installing, the fan began squeeling at lower speeds. It now squeels at all fan speeds when the temperature is low, which is of course when it is most needed. I'll probaly pony up for OEM when I replace this.
B0017J3XMU|5|Love the antenna ,it came in looking exactly as it did in the photo and description !
B00II5YADC|1|It will eventually scratch your car.
B002TQD2KI|1|I got a product with less than half the shelf life left on it.  No good unless you have several coolant systems to check in a few months.
B002UC4X04|5|The parts are just like original equipment. I just eed to remember to blow out the sprayer when winterizing.
B00CEM6J5M|5|These fit perfect and work great
B0058W70OY|5|looks awesome high quality.
B00KC8OLYQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2007 4Runner SR5. Installed myself, took about 30 minutes and saved a trip to the dealership.
B00ISLA1WA|5|Exactly what I needed to transform my 1.25 inch receiver into a 2 inch receiver for the hitch cargo carrier I bought. Fit perfectly on my Curt hitch on 2013 Malibu
B0031HEIDY|5|Excellent quality product at an amazing price. Fit my Honda perfectly and arrived promptly as advertised. Would definitely recommend these bulbs to anyone looking for standard bulb replacement.
B00OPMIR2M|5|great tool
B0094BFGG4|5|Works exactly like how it says!!! Very impressed!
B00JRHI0W2|5|I love this mattress.  I have had it a couple weeks now and could not be happier.  I weigh 200 lbs and it gives just enough, but not too much.  I would say it is a firm mattress with a soft top.  So you get the support you need, but the softness to keep your joints from aching.
B00I524QJ6|3|Difficult to apply.
B007Y86A0K|5|As for the product just as good as any auto parts store one at a 3rd of the price
B00IAZ5YWG|5|Great  quality and fits like it should
B00EB12V74|5|Excellent
B00ONDM07G|5|Great product but a tight fit for an iPhone 6+ with a case but the great part is my Garmin NUVI snaps right on if I take the cell phone holder off.
B000182ESM|5|Fit perfectly! Thanks
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Perfect put on kubota cab front and rear<br />Can't wait to go snow blowing this winter bright enough I could mow lawn at night
B000HE2VF6|4|So far so good...we'll see how they hold up. I wouldn't be surprised if the labels wear off that is the reason for the 4 stars instead of five.
B004BH76V4|5|Fits perfect in my Edge.
B000CFAVA2|5|easy installation. great product
B00DDOSUVG|5|worked very good in our 5th wheel
B006CRT72W|5|Works as promised.
B009I6A9KS|5|Fit great
B00AWNW9TK|5|Great product, took only 10 minutes to install and it works wonderfully.  I will have to say this was the first power window I attempted to fix, but it went well.
B007N3RW9Y|5|Installed in my 2001 Jeep Wrangler sport with the Dana 44 rear axle. Did it in an afternoon with hand tools. I had to remove my carrier and ring gear in order to remove the cross shaft. Wasn't too difficult. Just put everything back in the same place/orientation and torque to spec. Also refill with a slightly higher weight gear oil to quiet down the ratcheting sound.
B001EP0GQS|5|Fast delivery . Easy to install on my Toyota Highlander
B005OZQDUW|5|Goog, working fine!
B000BQQN2M|1|Holes  dont mach
B0041U8ZU2|5|Great, fit perfectly.  Matches exactly to the other.
B006BDRNHI|3|Great item forthe price.  The logo fell off and the paing for the lock and unlock button wore off in six months.  However it works great on the car.
B00C88ALWE|4|Every_thingok
B005NLQAHS|4|Works great and easy to use.
B00195JNA8|5|A quick solder job with the wiring harness that came with my Pioneer head unit and this thing was a plug & play install. I did have to flip the chime switch because I was getting double chimes.
B00ANZHG7C|5|THIS IS THE BEST CLOTH IVE TO CLEAN MY HOUSE OR SKATES OR MY BMK BIKE
B00BBXFJTC|5|Arrived as advertised and works perfectly.
B00BNVK14U|5|Was the exact coolant I needed for my 2014 F250 Powerstroke.  Will buy again.
B00LPE2PYY|5|OEM product as advertised
B00QKJEJV6|5|cool
B003CGDSBC|4|neoprene holder, not the strongest but works
B005V9O0VA|4|Lights are great with super white light. My only complaint is these lights must be removed to adjust, re-installed to check, and repeat procedure until the beam is correctly adjusted.
B00EEGAIJE|1|I got better reception with this crap off than I did when it was screwed in. Don't buy this crap.
B0046LHME6|4|Awesome product functionally. Looks great too.  A bit hard to install .. not for the amateur. The brackets holes needed to be drilled out. make sure you test fit the bolts in all holes.
B0068C2VGK|5|Great Product. Thank You.
B00FXYG58O|5|Very nice product, shipped quickly, and product met all my expectations. I have ordered more since first purchase. Great value!
B003CG9QFY|1|Not what is pictured. Doesn't fit 2015 jk like it says without modifying aka. cutting, shaping, stiching, etc. It is just a rectangle of webbing. Can make it for a few bucks at a fabric store. I tried to get them to send a new one thinking it was just wrong in box, nope got the same thing again.
B000924QO0|5|I saw in reviews that this wax was used on an electric battery-powered lawnmower's underside to keep the grass from sticking & causing the mower to bog down & stop---two coats I've given when brand new, and no grass has accumulated---works great!  Now all I have to do is win the lottery & buy a Dodge Challenger to use it on a car!
B00O1T056A|5|This is a must have for every car. Throw your jumper cables away!
B00HAQBEH0|5|Love this magnetic light, so much so, I purchased an additional two as gifts. Very bright.
B00B2YHFO2|4|Great lights for interior had one blow right away but the rest r fine now
B001R5VZRE|5|Always  great product.
B008ECC31U|5|good product
B00LOZLIYM|5|You would be envious of the wonderful looks I get when driving my beat-up 96 Civic prominently displaying this plate on front.  My Civic exudes class, and all the people that shake their heads in disdain are simply exhibiting their jealousy of knowing I have attained regularity.  My wife and daughter just LOVE riding in the Civic now.  My daughter even hid her face the first day of school when I was dropping her off because she didn't want her presence to take away from the car's character.  Oxidized paint, various fluids leaking, random bumper stickers, rusty wheels, silicone caulked window seals, and now the piece de resistance of this classy vanity plate.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B00SGD3QM2|5|Thank you
B00E0PS4WW|5|Love this suspension,have it installed and this is amazing.rides good and looks good
B000RFPQ16|5|Nice tool for the money.
B009FNX4G0|4|Looks great. One starting to rust less than a year of installation.
B00BFXOT94|3|They did the trick for our long dirtbike trip, but the material is surprisingly thin, and they were not cheap.
B0019QJ4EC|4|Pipe is exactly what I needed.  Just wish it came in shorter lengths
B008AZPJCG|4|I could have used an instruction sheet with this motor; I am a new (novice) boat owner and it took some time and a few trials to figure out how to install this item; it had three pins and only one was to be used.  Otherwise, I am quite satisfied with the product.
B002GYOQGC|5|I put them on my 99 vette and it worked perfectly
B00REJX5BQ|4|A little cheaply made but gets the job done.  Worth the money.
B00DUL8BSO|5|Awesome car cover and def better quality than I expected. Price and shipping were an amazing deal! Highly recommend this product.
B000C9B5EE|5|Great price, stopped the car from making noise
B000H8U7IU|5|Fully satisfied with shipment, delivery, and product.
B010TZ90N8|5|Great car seat covers! Will buy them again.
B005OK402K|1|I purchased two of these for our summer road trip and before we even left the state, both of them had ripped. The strap that goes around the headrest ripped right off, and the piping started fraying and coming off. The pockets are not as described, and did not fit any of my kids' books or toys. I would say go look for the Jeep one instead. I bought it a few years ago and it is a little bit more expensive, but WAY better.
B00ZUZXJOO|5|Great product
B004NLU1V0|5|looks great, although I had to enlarge the mounting holes to get it to align with the openings in the grille.
B001ADBV18|5|I installed this in my 2014 Toyota Tundra Double Cab (no subwoofer).  It fits perfectly under the seat with no interference.  I do have the All Weather mat on the floor which initially caused an issue.  The mat was smashed and buckled between the storage box and the center console and driver/passenger seat brackets.  But, you can slide the rear 1 inch of the mat under the storage box and it will still allow the seats to lock in the down position.
B00S75H99U|4|THE VALVE COVERS ARE A DECENT QUALITY FOR THE MONEY , THEY DO LOOK BETTER THEN OTHERS BECAUSE OF THERE EXTRA WIDTH WHICH COMES FROM THE BOLT HOLES BEING INTERNAL THE HARDWARE THAT CAME WITH THE COVERS WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME, THE HARDWARE IS CHEAP SCRAP ,, I WENT TO THE LOCAL HARDWARE AND PURCHASED THE 1/4 X20 IN STAINLESS THEN USED A DYE TO CUT MORE THREADS AND CUT THEM TO PROPER LENGTH
B000C2GGGI|5|very good parts
B006FSUFX8|3|Work great can tell  different with the original key
B00QH2MKGC|5|It was the best present eve . He absolutely loved it!!!
B00NLUU1SC|4|Bulbs work very well, they are very bright. I used them to replace the turn signal bulbs on my Club Car Precedent cart.
B00BTJBVJK|5|Looks and works great
B00NFSNAS8|2|AC power failed after a few minutes initial use; Fuse checked OK.  DC power was fine, but returned the unit since it was only 50% functional.
B000E8OVCG|5|I thought I might have been exageratting about my truck needing front shocks. After installing these I realized how bad I needed them. The old ones were so bad that after braking (hard & gently) they would stay partially compressed and pop up after realeasing the brake pedal. The front end is much firmer (in a good way) & braking feels better.
B0055AL6Q2|3|cheaply made with St Andrews Cross is a sticker and it wasn't even centered.
B004CGOGFS|3|It pulled pretty hard, but it doesn't hold on too well.  Kept slipping off the edge of my brake drums, even though I had the strap tightened down as tight as it could be, but I usually heard the strap stretching and then the thud of the arm popping off the drum and pulling free leaving the drum behind.  It did work OK in situations that didn't require too much pulling force, like using it to remove the drum once I had initially broke it free, and just needed to overcome the drag of the brake shoes.
B006WPQNB2|5|Work as advertise.
B007NZOALK|5|Fits on my 2014 Kawasaki Teryx4. Nice looking mirror!
B001P0AL62|5|Great Product!.  Very durable.... made of Heavy Duty materials!!
B00BGRDMOM|4|Did the job. Spaced my wheels out so they're now flush with the fender or perhaps 1/2&#34; out from them. A few tips: Get a wire brush and brush away as much rust and buildup as you can. You want a good contact between the spacers and the hub. Second: Get some good anti-seize and slather it on there in case you ever want to removed the spacers. Third: Be sure and use the red titebond to ensure the nuts never back off. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A TORQUE WRENCH. Don't just slap 'em on there and roll, or overdo it and break the studs off. Hit the right numbers and do it right. I've seen guys loose wheels and I've seen guys shear off studs. Do it right. My application is on road mostly so I cannot vouch for their strength off road.
B004RZU3VK|5|Have not installed them yet however arrived on time, good price and wires look excellent
B000JK2D06|5|Fantastic stuff. Believe the hype. Waxed my car, used 1/20, maybe, of the bottle and I actually used more than a needed.. Lots of waxes, little required.
B001HRIXTA|5|Worked out perfect
B00002243Y|5|High quality, works like a charm. I definitely recommend spending a few extra $$$ and getting the heavy gauge cables. This worked very well on an almost completely-dead battery (kid left interior lights on over a weekend).
B005O0QQ1S|4|Works perfectly on my husband's Nissan, but beware that it will not work in all cars. Did not work in our nanny's Kia
B00881EQ1C|5|Feet nice
B000C9CEOO|5|Fits perfect
B000BUQODG|5|Product better than i anticipated for the price. Very satisfied with the product
B000KOR766|5|As advertised except for fuses (not as shown in picture)--larger fuse holders, but worked ok in my application.  Could be a problem depending on specific installation.  Good product that compliments the charger well.
B00C5RB03W|5|Work well as replacement lid.
B00HVHN0D4|5|Perfect.
B007TYFKKU|5|Great in all aspects
B00UW2K2IQ|4|Very nice. Close to factory look. But not exact
B00I53ZNYM|5|Excellent product. The build quality of these pegs is excellent. The price is what you would expect for this kind of workmanship.
B008S9CHW4|5|Fits really well. Great price. Love the padding inside. Only downside is I love to hear the sound of the engine while riding but this helmet blocks the noise. Great helmet for a great price. Cheaper than WMT.
B013ME9PII|5|Installed on my Kawasaki Versys, left side with Hand Guards and Bar End Weights. Works great for me and solves some key problems with all the various other helmet hooks and holders, factory or otherwise. The best thing 2 things: 1) your helmet hangs free - not rubbing or banging against any part of the bike, so no damage to either and 2) very convenient quick place to hang tour helmet while gassing up or stopped for a water break or even a quick meal - no keys, or combinations to fiddle with and no contortion moves trying to get helmet and hook device lined up and latched. The helmet hook is a definite winner for me.
B0002LBGX2|5|JUST FINISHES MY BLACK MAZDA MIATA GT AND CANT BELIEVE THE SHINE LOOKS BETTER THAN WHEN NEW.  LOOKS LIKE THE CAR IS WET AND SHINES LIKE GLASS.  I WONT USE ANYTHING BUT THIS WAX FROM NOW ON.  FRANK
B0073LAI1A|5|Perfect fitting, Moreover Good that center are connected!!!
B007AHP8M6|5|Good product
B000VKRQBA|5|Every time I go in for an oil change, they say I need to replace my air filter and they want to charge an arm and both legs to do it!<br />This filter is easy to install. Great price! Save you money and replace it yourself!
B0010Z4MDK|5|fast delivery!!! Exactly what I needed! Thank you!
B00U9WN3QW|5|fit great sealed great
B00GFI3FOY|5|did the job arrived quickly
B00336XFK0|5|Very good item.
B00W64O8AG|5|Like it
B00HFMTYFS|1|Sent a different plate frame than pictured. I dont have time to send it back because i threw out my old one and my car is a sept 11 tribute car that will be displayed tomorrow. ..first time ive ever been disappointed in an order through amazon.  Sending me the one pictured would be great .i hope that happens.
B007ED84XG|2|I got this and didnt remember what vehicle i ordered it for my 2010 dodge ram or my 2012 camaro but that didnt matter much cause it doesnt fit either one!!! Waste of money!!
B0049MAREE|5|good matcch
B000RI0GIG|1|Disappointed, ..did not come with the measuring insert that is shown in picture
B005VPS358|5|I use these on my CJ-7 to stretch the wheel base 6&#34;. I had a set from a junkyard on it, but they began to sag on one side. I replaced both springs with these and the ride height matches now and the quality of ride is awesome. Should have replaced them years ago.
B001CIEDT8|5|Always  great product.
B000EDQQJM|5|Perfect for adding that extra counter space needed in my small RV
B00W31VMYC|4|it´s ok, no working with focus 2000-2004
B000GZPEOG|5|Very nice cover. Did alot of shopping & glad I chose this one.
B00823KTGW|1|Piece of junk save your money, I bought them and they lasted less than 1 1/2 years I replaced them one time under warranty.
B000BG1X54|4|Have a 55gal drum, whose manual pump &#60;http://i01.geccdn.net/site/images/large_wco/833100_2wco.gif&#62; was problematic from day One, stubbornly resisting its duties, and leaking gasoline when finally persuaded. It's now given up any pretense of functionality, and will be retired to the parts bin. And that thing cost a pretty penny. And then there's this. It's cheap, it's simple (less likely to fail) the tube is sufficiently long, good through-flow, no danger of a mouth full of gasoline. Perfect, economical solution for a 55gal drum. Not suitable for every job - no good for siphoning gas from my motorcycle tank; the brass shaker refuses to compromise with the limited internal clearance - but for this application, it's just right.
B00O4YBE1M|1|Don't buy. It's a very cheap looking and feeling fender. You'd be better off actually spending the money on something fiberglass or metal instead of this cheap hunk of injection molded plastic.
B00T8E2Q9C|5|So cute!!  got this for BF who just got another two Havanese to replace his beloved Milo.  Looks great and just cool on the car.
B001413GG4|5|Arrived on time and packaged very good. It looks great on my car. The decal sticker shows great detail on the light house. The seller is so nice!! Thank you!!!
B00CKXDF0W|3|I bought these for my 2005 Mustang GT. I installed a pair of Redline hood struts, and wanted to add a pair of extensions that would also cover the hole from the now-unnecessary prop rod.  Previous reviews stated they fit very well.<br />Unfortunately, mine were considerably off from being an exact fit, and I had to do much adjusting to the existing radiator coverings to make them look decent.<br />Even after all the adjusting I could possibly do, there are significant gaps between these and the factory covers, with enough space to see the tabs that are supposed to hold them in place.<br /> In this age of computer templates, and at this price point, I was expecting a much tighter and factory-fit look.<br />At least they cover the prop rod hole, or else they would have been returned.
B00B5ZYY38|5|Just what I wanted and they work well too. I bought them for my new front plate and they worked so well I orderd them for the back as well. They will never rust and the black cap matches the plate.
B007ONPFC4|5|Really is a genuine part.  Perfect fit, no problems
B00COYNTNK|5|bought for daughter's birthday, as mad on disney!  not had it yet, as birthday not until 27th, but myself and everyone else love it.  tried it in her car to make sure ok, and it is.  would definitely recommend as a practical and unique gift
B007DBTOXS|3|Look great on my 525i! Only complaint, the LEDs provided to replace the bulb under the dash (the two that light up the front floor panels) were too small.
B00X6GJXLM|5|It's absolutely gorgeous! It was was to install and made my bike look ten times better than before! I highly recommend this taillight. It's high quality material, and definitely worth the money!
B005RJ3GBE|5|Great alternative to a $250.00 replacement key from the dealer. Relatively easy to swap components from the original case. 2008 rabbit.
B008CE0O8E|5|Works great easy install. Thanks again.
B000XSI902|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B004ME4NDA|5|Compact and useful product.  Folding it is kinda tricky but it works!
B0007WJRF0|5|I loved
B001NQ9E6Q|4|Great product.
B004ALBUYU|5|Great price and quick delivery ++++ If you disconnect the old one for two hours start working for another six months
B003S8AJAM|5|Works great. Locksmith cut it for me and now I have an extra key at about 1/3rd the price it would be at the dealer.
B000H6PUPC|4|Good quality paint, purchased to match volvo's grey trim that comes on Nordkap vehicles.  Not entirely scratch resistant, but good coverage and priced very well.
B000TR4JE2|4|Rack holds the bike very well.  Rail was too long for rear door to open fully.  I was able to cut off about six inches, and now it works fine.
B00390BS7C|4|Did the job well
B009DK98MO|5|Works great so far and was an exact fit for an 03 Elantra.
B000IXUCSE|5|Easy to use!
B00BD4YFO4|4|Nice covers but the bottoms of the covers want to easily slide off.
B003W0F33O|5|works perfectly
B0077HAOBE|5|High quality products are rare these days. worked awesome.
B000182F0E|4|Bought these for a 2004 Olds Alero.  Easy to put on. Fits well enough. Allows the car to vent.
B000CGRMXU|5|Best brakes. We have used EBC before on our old Expedition, these pads are tough and durable. Living in Montana there are curves and bends and these brakes are the best at holding and not burning up. Love EBC.
B00M1OUBES|5|Jumped my car when car battery died in my driveway.  As promised, it worked!  Life saver!
B003TUNRGM|5|Worked great on my floors for a 1952 chevy coupe. add the right amount.
B00XO13JUA|5|Does what it purports to do ... nicely sized ...
B007USCM7E|5|worked as advertised
B00DGRPE9Q|5|Prompt delivery and perfect fit. We purchased a set of hubs from a big box auto parts store that were the wrong axle size due to a incorrect listing. These were exactly what we needed.
B004PHNKUQ|5|Looks great and performs well. I bought this cover to take advantage of the drain plug. I would recommend to anyone with a 8.8 and likes to perform their own maintenance. I used this on my F150.
B00EQ5068G|5|My husband loves it for his garage stool! Very comfortable.
B00029WYVW|3|The squirt bottle design for the oil doesn't work as well as the aerosol can; the oil was running everywhere and took longer to apply.
B007IPL0PY|5|could not beat the price.
B000YC7GBU|5|Good
B008WOUNAI|2|This product was average.  It fit well, but seems to be cheaply made.  One of the bolts snapped in half while tightening it, causing a major delay in getting the truck back on the road.  They did replace it, but the hassle of sending the old part back and waiting on the new one to arrive was annoying.
B000C9OI5M|5|Took care of Engine light perfectly
B001PYN8T0|2|I bought these to replace the glass fuses in my old land Cruiser. I also bought a new fuse block (non-toyota replica) . The  breakers are fine but the pop out of the fuse holders too easily. I am afraid they will just squirt out when I start hitting some bumps.They are also a bit bulky and I wont be able to used the fuse block cover. All in all I don't think it was a good idea for my application.
B00B2AAK7U|4|Don't listen to this guy. Likely his truck was old and ragged out and in need of front end work prior to this lift. And NO WAY would a ford dealer put this is on a truck. It's an easy install and make the truck look great. Yes, the ride is a little stiffer but that's not related to the brand of lift. It's physics. If you increase the angle of the control arms, they are less forgiving.<br /><br />Just be realistic. If you have over 100k on your truck, it will need front end work. Regardless of this or not. Be a responsible truck owner and fix the worn out parts with quality parts like MOOG and never worry about it again
B00KTE0P2A|5|all good.  Thanks for the prompt service!
B009XQKCQY|5|Very low power draw. Important tool to have when your on the water.
B000N9OCGG|5|Great Quality!  Feels like it will last longer than a plastic one
B0018YGMWM|5|Amazing Difference from RS5000. Adjustable to type of driving. Love them...
B00F7GZI68|4|I have had 2 compliments saying it was cute.  It is just the right size for a slice in the back bumper from a boat trailer hitch.
B00183EPDG|2|I used two of them and they could not stand the weight of a standard vending machine. The bearings inside the wheels went everywhere after laying the machine down. The machine only weighs 800 pounds
B003UTOOXC|5|Looked great sound better
B00XD5WQU6|4|Looks awesome, wasn't too bad installing. Didn't contour to the fender like I imagined but it worked out in the end.
B00OJMYAL0|5|Great experience
B00U2C3UDU|5|The stock pipe is absolutely garbage I was have constant boost leak issues running stage two. As soon as I put this on I wasn't having a boost leak anymore.
B00S5O3DIY|4|Great product! I'm a teacher and I love using these to create collaborative work spaces on my classroom walls.
B005VWTGZM|5|Fast delivery.  Easy to install, fits perfectly.  A little expensive (there were other ones that were cheaper but delivery was going to take longer). No problems so far.
B000XY00J4|5|My husband bought this seat for me because I was having tailbone pain after an hour or so of riding. We put it on my 2009 Vulcan Custom and rode several days in a row for several hours. No more pain and it's such a comfortable seat!!! I love it. Thanks honey!😊
B00RK1XXRE|5|I was thinking about adding this turbo kit to my 350 Chevrolet Nova engine. ..
B0108MF9TG|5|Excelent product, I am buying for my friends as well because we loved the item.
B000I117KS|5|Excellent, received product within 24 hours using standard shipping. Fit vehicle perfect and looks<br />great. Installed in about 15 minutes.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Glad I bought it. I was able to put one large suitcase, one large floor fan, 2 large overstuffed backpacks, 6 beach towels and 2 large blankets in this bag. I used the beach towels and blankets to fill up the open spaces so the bag was filled out. It may have been overkill, but to make things easier I laid this out in my living room and packed it up on the floor so I would know exactly what I was putting it in before I put it on top of my truck. Strapping it to my truck was super easy. I tied up the extra straps and there was ZERO wind noise. I literally forgot it was up there until we stopped for food/bathrooms and I saw it. I checked the straps at every stop and it never came loose. I did not encounter rain, but we did encounter TONS of dust. Everything inside stayed clean and dust free. Very glad I purchased this. I do recommend getting the anti-slip/protective mat to go under it.
B004Q7AGRU|5|These mats fit my 2015 MINI Cooper perfect! They were a great price and were delivered quickly.
B00CHEWFAU|5|Perfect fit and looks & feels like OEM.
B000TYVLF0|5|Works and fits perfectly on my 2006 Ford Taurus 3.0L SE.
B000N322K0|5|Works great, just make sure you have the correct style floor jack with removable pad, to use this device.
B0018JU5B6|5|NGK makes good spark plugs
B000C2CAH2|5|Gasket arrived in good condition and fit and  functioned as expected.
B004KK553I|1|Don't waste your money! Rhinestones started falling off within the first two weeks. Does not really look like the picture. Dull and cheaply made. I took it off my car after less than a month. It didn't even go through a car wash.
B00GWEUSL4|5|Worked perfectly!
B006X8CH86|3|easy installation, but somewhat loose, spokes bend easily. ok for the price
B00326WGB0|3|For the price I suppose they are fine but they don't fit the contours of the foot well very well and I'm sure most Aston Martin owners would prefer a little better quality.  As for the construction, they are made well but it would have been nice to have a heal pad under the brake and gas pedals so the shoe heal wouldn't be constantly digging into the carpet.  Obviously this area will wear quickly.  But for the price of OEM Aston Martin mats I can buy about 5 of these mats.  It's your call.  For an average car I'm sure they would be fine. But they still need the heal pad.
B004GE9POI|4|The part is solid and well finished. The primer looks good.  My issues keeping it from being 5 stars are: it is missing a few bolt holes the OEM part has and the packaging was horrible.<br /><br />It was in a giant box wrapped in plastic with a foot of free space in the box for it to bounce around in.<br /><br />The holes were easy enough to drill.<br /><br />I'm happy with it.
B005FUWPXU|5|I love my leds. They were very easy to install. They shipped faster than expected and they came with a lot of extra leds
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Very nice floor mats for the front and back. Not to thick or thin. Keeps the carpet on my new 2015 Nissan Rogue clean!
B007XTOMHI|5|No problems. Fast shipping.
B008XSGO4C|5|I'LL recommend this product..fits with my 2012 Nissan Altima..very good 😊
B00NGJEN5K|5|Took a gamble and ordered for a Nissan Navara.  It was a perfect fit and takes just 15 minutes to assemble.  ample headroom inside and a great quick getaway idea.  ideal to use on our frequent scuba diving weekends.
B00EZ8V1XS|3|Good product. Printing could be better as there is a black trace line around the other colors.
B00XS04XPW|4|Great for the price. Work well, easily installed. Fast shipping
B00CRT8VPS|5|Matches all my purple accessories, including my new gun
B008N82D2E|5|Excellent product.  Has worked very well in my bike.  Nice to have the added security.
B00W5MG8XY|5|love it
B000C55SXW|5|works
B00KMR3J7M|5|works great  on time great price<br />thanks Amazon
B000EAIERW|4|Arrived on time. Working fine.
B000VB3R2G|5|Just as described..was easy to install.  Very pleased with the fast shipment. Highly recommended. !!
B00KTIXICK|1|They did not work
B000EQAVJ0|5|Just perfect
B00857CM8S|4|Good quality
B000KYV1CW|5|It took three times to get the programming right, yet it worked.  The failed attempts were execution errors versus unclear directions.  We only had one working remote in which most offerings required two working remotes.  You have to buy a key separately which is another story as the key requires to be cut by a dealer or a locksmith.  You can configure the remote yourself.
B005SUX9MI|5|Greqt tool. Works as described.
B00OZVOHTK|5|fast ship best price
B00MSAOUF6|5|Love it thanks
B00HE6CI58|5|Perfect for my 2003 Acura RSX; almost too bright.
B000EQ7A9O|5|Easy install
B00C0SQ8KG|4|Great bar for the price.  would buy again.
B00CWKMD5Q|2|These are not great quality and did not fit my vehicle seats although they were supposed to.  Even though I returned them, I have to admit that the customer service was good.  They promptly responded to my request to return them.
B00CEXKBS2|1|Fronts are good. Rear windows are not - they bend inward in the middle. I opened the rear window today and when I tried to close it the window hit the Ventshade and stopped 1&#34; short of closing. Had to exit the truck and hold the plastic out in order to close the window.
B000C2UEB6|5|Exact fit great product
B00WV055CK|5|Shop around, this item at this price is great. Fits perfectly, and made of high quality material. Takes less than 30 seconds to install. Have not had any issues with the net coming lose from the attachments. Prices vary on Amazon and other websites. Decided to try the lowest cost option and very happy with the purchase.
B002YLRN30|5|Works beautiful it`s gotten me out of trouble 1/2 dozen times already well worth what I paid
B00JXR45E8|5|Fits Dana 44 perfect. Professionally made out of heavy duty material.
B006MX7ZB6|4|they were fairly easy to install. They differently improved the look of the interior of my truck at a minimal cost.
B003VAX31O|3|It's to  stiff but it works
B006N95ODA|5|Excellent Product, good quality and fit it.  I think that is the same quality than oem part.
B0076AUCKU|5|Easy to put on, gives you your radio back!
B00D6R5VQW|5|Item came as expected, actually faster than time they posted.  It fit and working well.
B006B3BVP8|5|Love it
B010XZRQCG|5|I used this on my car over my license plate and when I took the old one out and replaced with this bulb, it is MUCH brighter.  I didn't even realize how dim my old bulb was until I replaced it with this.
B002XL2IBS|5|works great for the money
B002MPHZX6|5|It fit perfectly, There is a little arrow on the side to help with orientation. I am very pleased and have received many compliments on it. So people even said they wished they bought this vinyl instead of painting theirs.
B0033YDFKM|5|Exact fit for vehicle
B00QO333ZQ|1|Everything looked good outta the package but that's about as far as it got. Instructions on how to hook it up to light not very clear but not too hard to figure out on your own. Problem was when hooking up.the wires to the back one of the prongs that the wires hook to was loose and when I pulled the wire off the prong came off with it. Switch is totally useless now. Not satisfied with this product.
B00HX526CU|5|This light is very bright and durable.  A little heavy if you are planning on backpacking or anything
B009XIX6S8|5|Perfect fit good deal
B00CIJ3T1S|4|goes on pretty easy, looks nice too.
B003EP163I|5|ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT , USES A O RING SEAL AND NO OTHER GASKET , PLUS IT ROTATES 360 DEGREES FOR EXACT PLACMENT
B0010EYAX8|1|Don't buy this thing.  Only used it a few times in my popup camper.  Mine wouldn't charge up enough to run a small fan after being charged up all nite.  Lite was green but no juice.  Worthless.
B00HAPHTC0|1|i received broken product otherwise it made in Chaina !
B00SFKMRT4|4|It's okay, I ordered gray and it doesn't really match my interior that well. The color is much lighter than bmw grey interiors. It also rides up out of place sometimes, but overall does its job well for the price.
B000BPURBG|4|NICE PRODUCT AS LONG AS YOU ADJUST THE POINTER WERE YOU WANT IT BEFORE INSTALLATION , YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO READJUST WITH OUT SOME DISASSEMBLEY OF THE ENGINE THERE JUST IS NOT ENOUGH ROOM
B000CPI0FA|5|Great stuff. Smells for a couple days but then goes away but paint stays.
B0007M1ZGE|5|Easy to install,  Very well made.  Quite happy with this product.
B008V20AX6|5|Friend loves it
B004B61B34|5|This works great.  Fit my 2015 jeep wrangler.  I used a utube video to help with the install.  Had to take off the bumper to get hitch on but that was no big deal.  took me about 45 min to install.
B003ZIXKMO|4|The package arrived a little beat up, I thought there might be damage to the item.  Thankfully there was not.  The installation instructions were simple and accurate.  As for the actual install, I was able to do it in 15 minutes.  Most of that time was waiting for the alcohol to dry.  Which the shades come with alcohol wipes, I found them later after I had installed the shades.  The only issue was the double sided stickem on one of the shades was not lined up properly and there was some overhang of it.  Good value, they have staid on for a 500 mile trip and a few car washes.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|These are the best towels I've ever used. They are so soft and wash great. I love using them on the windows.
B000P9IDHS|5|Bought this for my 1997 Nissan Pickup XE.  Part was a perfect fit and i have not had any problems with it in the two years since it was installed.
B0006BID70|5|Great kit.  I used this to rebuild a Volvo transmission.  I used it to pull seals and bearing races out, and then used the round attachment to drive seals back in (convenient size for me).  Also used it to pull a pilot bearing out of an engine crank.  Pieces of this tool are better quality in person than they appear in the low-resolution photos online.  Good stuff.
B00EZ0FWL8|5|This has worked well in our trailer. Right size, not too firm, not too soft, not too heavy. I like the idea of the gel, because the memory foam is famous for retaining heat. It is pretty good eliminating motion transfer as well.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Works good
B008O1N1JE|5|runs a lot smoother now
B00EL37R8U|5|only had them in about a month but good so far
B00KTJ84YG|1|doesn't work on my truck, this product should also come with this saying, we do not provide instructions on how to program this product
B0073MG6UG|5|it fit my 1986 ford-f250 5.-fast shiping
B000QQ4WPM|4|Arrive on time ...no defects noted
B0051D3MP6|5|Great charger, easy to use, excellent service and price!
B0047ECW56|5|I love these on my Jeep!
B00GSAUHB8|5|I like how the sunshade works. Unfortunately, it's too small for my Toyota Camry 2008, which is quite surprising for me. The description sounded like the sunshade would be a good fit for most cars (considering it fits SUVs and trucks), and Toyota Camry is not some exotic oversized car. Perhaps the seller should have provided compatibility information. I'm going to try the jumbo version of the shade. Having a hole of a hook for the rear view mirror could have made this product acceptable for me, but the shade nothing like that.
B007AOSDNK|5|it is perfectly feet in Camry 2014.
B000E7WLJW|5|Very good. A little pricey, but worth every penny!
B000LNBLTK|3|not so good
B00MGHVRVG|5|Works really well as an additive to a water cooler system for a 50W CO2 laser cutter.
B005VNWHSY|1|Only lasted 4 months then threw codes!!!
B001B5E16W|5|fast service and great price
B003TXH6XE|3|Hardware was good quality but didn't include enough pieces to mount the two smaller flares to the rocker panels.  The fenders look great and are a little more flexible, but not any thinner, than the ones I removed.  The edge trim is useless.  I ended up using the edge trim from my previous flares as they were identical to the new ones.  The flares themselves are good to go and the hardware is great but this is not quite a five star product.
B001DRHMPK|5|Fast n no damage
B00BFU0X06|5|No issues with this product, works as is and no hose kinks.
B008HZOZ2E|4|Good product.
B00PIT79F2|1|Tachometer did not work correctly, neither did the temp guage. The wording on the guage is different than the pictures, and therefore does not replace the oem part correctly. The speedo reads in km/h which I was aware of when ordering, but the description said nothing about it. I highly recommend staying away from this product and anything this company sells. False descriptions and faulty products.
B0031HT8JS|5|Just what I needed for my Jeep 2005 Grand Cherokee. Works perfectly
B00VNBDWPK|4|Great product. Well packaged. Easy to install. They are exactly what they say they are. I purchased a set of the H11s for my 2012 Silverado. I was impressed enough to go a head and order the high beams and fog lights as well as a set for my ATV. I would recommend this product to any one as an upgrade from Standard lighting.<br /><br />Now my only complaint. They do not have the down the road distance that a HID does as far as roadway lighting. They do have a much better peripheral range though.
B00G258I0G|5|used as extra step on our 5th wheel very pleased
B002XRODX8|5|Love it.
B0097IECXM|5|Absolutely perfect fit and genuine parts.
B002OUMVWY|5|Great quality, works great!
B005NLQAHS|5|This works like a charm with any of the apps available for it,
B00R8N6916|5|the right product at the right price. Amazon saves me tons over the Harley dealer!!!
B00QWYO5A4|5|Classic design.  It gets a little hot in an enclosed vehicle.  Gloves work would do the trick.
B00I14OP6W|2|Printed on crear, very thin vinyl. Vinyl is NOT cut to the shape of the wrench. If you want that shape, you'll have to cut them yourself (pain in the butt). I would not have ordered them if I would have known.
B00NSGCVWI|4|This cable was a little long for my use, but fit what I needed exactly. I was able to set up and use my bookshelf speakers in no time. I am no audiophile but these wires sound like they transfer the music fine.
B00BTGSGL4|5|Great price for quality towels, soft material and very absorbent.
B00BCRMBGQ|3|The seat covers stated that they would fit my 14 Dodge Ram 1500 but, they didn't. So, I contacted OxGord to explain the matter and they were very courteous and professional about the matter and took care of my issue. I wish the covers would have fit because the quality of the covers wasn't bad.
B000A09MCW|5|Perfect fit, Outstanding Product.
B000C83PLQ|5|Installed months ago and no problems yet
B000CMD9Q8|5|Most secure locking lug nuts I have ever used.
B00JA1BMHU|1|These are by far the worst fitting headers I have ever installed. Only 6 of the 8 head bolts would go in straight. Had to drill out 2 of the bolt holes on the driver side and had to completely redrill every bolt hole on the passenger side. Had to put them on and take them off more than a dozen times to get them to fit. I had to tap new threads in both ball flanges cause the threads that came were so bad that no bolt would fit. No ball flange hrdware came with them either. Had to go buy bolts. My and your time is definitely worth more than the $98 for these headers. Be smart and buy a better name brand and not these.
B0002NUNIO|5|Great quality.
B000CQ6G3W|5|good
B010JRJYFK|5|Good quality
B00N2CIQ22|5|Don't go to the dealership to have these installed; they are super easy to do yourself, and it will save you a surprising amount of $ for a little effort! And these ones work great!
B00X6K9DKE|5|The seller did a good job the size I needed was a smaller size that's all but all in all it was a good !
B00ANQ5EIE|2|Installed 2 new lights on my 95 T Bird.<br />looked the next day and housing cracked at the lens and ingressed water in to the headlight assembly. Cracked all around.headlight assy.
B00A740VQM|5|It's the best $10.00 I've ever spent!
B00KTHXJHK|3|WE JUST NEED TO GET IT PROGRAMMED NOW, BUT SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE THE PROGRAM TAG, WE ARE REALLY FIGHTING THE PROCESS.. THE KEY DOES HOWEVER STILL UNLOCK THE DOORS, JUST WILL NOT START THE ENGINE..
B00SLXTI56|5|Perfect!  Well made and fast delivery
B00M51RFF0|5|Work perfect on my zx10r 2007 thank you will do business again
B000ZLSF74|5|I lov it.....
B003COTFS4|5|fit well , works great
B0075LKE2Q|3|This was a ok decal. It comes as a whole sticker not what is shown. You will have to cut out the decal for it to look like what is shown. Buy if you have the time to cut it out.
B00NJ7VV36|5|Thank you. Got this part for our jeep liberty. Exactly same as broken part. Very prompt delivery !!!!! Again thank you
B0010E3JUI|3|the right price at the right time.
B009F10S3Y|1|This product is a joke. It's overpriced well marketed Foam. Yes, Foam, not rubber. It has absolutely no durability as they claim. If the product comes into the slightest contact with anything, it begins to show signs of use. You would think that since the product is the lowest point of the car they would have used some special material to make it durable as I thought it was. I have not tried the &#34;Pro&#34; version but I'm not about to drop another $40-$50 to find out.<br /><br />I had this product on for less than 2 weeks on a car that was not lowered, and it does not look good anymore. Worst part is that they won't refund your money, instead they offer 30% off the purchase of a new one. Which in my opinion is insult to injury. Stay away from this version of this product it's a waste of money. Unless of course your willing to drop $35 every few weeks or you have a lifted 4x4 vehicle.<br /><br />Here is the response you'll get when you complaint or ask for a refund:<br /><br />&#34;We're sorry to hear this. Due to the nature of this product, the EZ Lip may get damaged over time. The product's durability is dependent on how well it's installed on the vehicle and how you drive. For these reasons, we do not offer a warranty except for manufacturer defects upon receipt of the product.<br /><br />Based on the images, it appears the EZ Lip has suffered some scrape damage. This is normal type of damage given it's flexible rubber composition.<br /><br />We have recently released the all new EZ Lip PRO model which is made from our strongest Dura-X Foam compound and can absorb far more scrapes before it begins to deteriorate. It also has our Patent-Pending InvisEdge feature for a seamless and professional appearance.<br /><br />As a valued customer, the best we can offer you is a 30% discount on your next order from our website. Just use promo code 30off to receive the discount.<br /><br />Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to assist you.&#34;

B003HB5VIU|1|Not what we expected.better as photo vs. Tires
B005H53GWW|1|These bulbs do not last! I have went through 4 in 5 months.. They blow very fast. I've even changed the fuses and everything in my car.
B005NLQAHS|3|This is nice but they wont let you clear codes anymore..... Glad I got this for nothing.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|spent two weeks everyday at the beach, kept the sand off.  Shakes off easy enough and folds up to carry.  Sand doesn't seem to come through the cracks.  If needed would definitely buy again.
B001LHVOVK|4|Oh yeah, follow the directions, you get all the bad news.  The good news, it's not difficult to follow the instructions.  Just by it.
B002N5DE62|5|good quality fuses at a good price.
B0031G8GME|5|The hardest part about installing this wiring kit was taking apart the foam pieces in my 2011 Subaru Outback to access the wiring connectors and then putting them back.  Maybe 10 minutes?  It works great.  Just remember to put the fuse into the holder before you put everything back in your vehicle. Ran the wiring behind the left rear interior pieces and then the excess I put in the spare tire well.  There's a rubber grommet cover there that is easily removed to allow external under access for your trailer/hitch light hook up.  I hooked this up to a Bully  CR-007A Receiver hitch cover and it works perfect.
B00A740VQM|1|Very cheap case

B00UCNCSJ6|5|So far this product is exactly like described and performs great!  Definitely worth the money.
B004W4OOZW|5|I can not tell you how many compliments I get on these lights. It transformed my truck from the usual to the spectacular. I bought this truck which is 8 years old the body has some rough spots but once I put on these lights you don't even notice it.  I am constantly getting compliments on the truck and it no longer looks like every other Tacoma out there.  Excellent quality.  I initially had a problem a few days into it.  When I installed these I did not know my corner marker light bulbs were out so I had to run down to the local auto store to replace them.  It was simple to reach but when I did I must have hit the small led lights and loosened them up.  I did not notice until I saw the reflection of my truck on a window and there were a few of the lights out.  I contacted Amazon they sent me a new pair no hesitation.  I went to reinstall there and when I did I noticed the lights were loose.  I turned them to lock them in place and it has been 3 weeks not no issue.  I would highly recommend these if you want your truck to look aggressive.  Wait don't buy these it's been nice not having the same look on tons of trucks look somewhere else.  But all seriousness this is an excellent buy for the price and the look.
B0050DCD3Y|5|A needed part if you want to add the decorative flame speaker trim. Looks great once installed.  Check to see if you get all the screws before installing. Kuryakyn does not carry replacement screws.
B007NMHFY2|5|Amazon was the only place that I could find the nozzle that would fit my car and it was cheaper than all the auto places. Also I didn't have to wait weeks for it to arrive and it fits perfectly and easily to install.
B00ITJQT2M|4|Zoom zoom
B00KTIZ1L6|1|This item didn't match with the vehicle that I ordered it for. I don't know not.
B002MQCYO0|5|Excellent product, only thing I use
B004QPCLC0|5|They are perfect!.  The only drawback was, I tried to install them myself, but the old ones didn't come off easily - parts of the pegs that hold them on broke off. Ended up having to take it to my local mechanic who had to drill the holes out in order to put the new grilles on.  Didn't cost much, so I am now a happy camper!  Thanks, Amazon
B00DI3DV6G|3|good
B00873J0YY|2|Item doesn't fit Trac Rac
B000HTRNRC|3|sensing bulb is very sensible and it damages very easily
B00RTLUPVC|5|Works as it should with no issues. The Flexibility is a plus
B006AFAWYI|3|Great system. Seems to work ok. Only problem is I think you will have to apply 5 times as often as hand waxing. I used it on my motorhome. Good concept to use in rv park when you can not use water to was vehicle but wax is very thin.
B00652RDPW|5|Works exactly as advertised.  Easy to install, and easy to program.
B00Y5H3AO2|1|Did not work as advertised and in order to return it,  would have to pay for the return shipping and a 20% &#34;restocking fee&#34; on a defective product.
B000C5I2YO|4|Arrived super fast. It is a Brake Pedal Pad, what else is there to say?
B00266TXF4|1|Does bot work
B006X8ASLY|5|it was installed easy on my 03 explorer

B008N1LZMK|5|Great Seller !!!!! Great Item !!!!! Super Fast Delivery !!!!! Thank you !!!!!
B0009N0W6U|1|burned otu fast
B000630GP0|5|Great filter for gear heads. Cleaning the filter is easy. Works great on my VW.

B0066SULQS|5|Works just like OEM product, but 1/3 the price!
B004PGIK9S|4|Good fit - lighter material than the BESTOP version but I expected that with the price I paid.
B002QYR2O0|4|Very nice
B0000AX5X5|5|I use these to keep out yard debris from my eyes while I am mowing.  Works great.  They are comfortable and fogging doesn't seem to be a problem.  The foam around the frame is very thick so my vision is a bit restricted, but it's manageable.
B004TSCT3U|5|Makes my leather steering wheel touchable even in 100 degree heat
B00M5F8C26|5|Exact replacement on my 2003 Polaris Magnum 330 4x4, great price.

B000IY6WIW|5|air conditioner FIXED!
B000H961YI|1|died within a few days
B00B8Y0QPG|5|Yes, fit perfectly. Look awesome on 2015 JK Sport. And absolutely easy to install. Just need a ratchet and about 20-30 minutes. So worth it. A local Jeep shop quoted me about $150 to install. Glad I didn't use them, and based on what I know now, won't be. DIY.
B004GE8AT4|5|Fit great and functions well.
B002X6VXL4|3|I don't seem to be able to make the jump starter work.  I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or what, but it hasn't worked well yet.  The air compressor is ok ... I just haven't used it enough yet to say for sure.  It all looks good and seems sturdy.
B005OQYCKE|1|Piece of junk...don't waste your time! Jumper cables were about as cheap as you could possibly make them and are sure to burn up the first time you use them...same with the silly little tools. Avoid this product at all costs
B00O5AN6UC|3|Too small!! I don t have the right stickers to send it back...see thé photo
B00ESQKKXO|4|Got what i paid for.
B00YEQKJM0|1|Not CANBUS. I installed the amber ones and still had hyperflash. Don't waste your money.
B00NMXM4RE|5|Works great
B000RG5UMA|5|great
B00PEKL2IU|5|this is a perfect helmet for my scooter.  I wear glasses and the visor lowers and does not interfere with my glasses.....that is great.
B0068ERM0S|1|What pygmy goat fornicator designed this hairlipped, bass ackwards junk?!  First off, the inseam is NOT designed to ride a motorcycle.  If you straddle a seat, you have two options, tear the crotch, or not use the stirrup allowing the legs to come over your boot covers.  Second, the cuffs won't adjust to smaller than Aunt Cankles' thigh size, and that allows tons of water to blow up your arm.  Oh, but if you're looking for an inflatable parachute (which is what this makes b/c of the HUGE cuff size), then it's pretty good....<br />I didn't expect great things at this price, but with the lowest of expectations, I was still disappointed.  Returned with a smile.
B004HIVFDC|5|Love these travel bugs & can't wait to send them on their way! Thank you for the quick delivery!
B0040CYXSE|5|Perfect product as describe
B001RBCU90|5|Never seen this design anywhere before or since, so I feel original driving around with it (especially when all four dogs are on board - then I'm sure people see it and laugh). It was really easy to apply and hasn't peeled or chipped at all, even in heavy weather.
B0016GZQ60|5|Works great for quieting squeaky things, and doesn't attract dust.
B004A6LASQ|5|perfect fit
B000BGJWA2|5|Install this in my camper for a through the wall AC power outlet works great
B00JW1W8P8|4|Seems to be just as good as the factory regulator. After I installed I have had a minor issue but I think it's my switch. When using the auto up feature it goes up and then back down on its own about 6&#34;.  It's a little annoying but not enough to remove and install another one.
B00PP6ORAS|5|perfect
B013FJKJRG|5|My Ford Fusion has had the check engine light pop on twice in the past month-ish.  I'm the type of person that will get a bit nervous when my check engine light pops on.  I'm not the kind of person that stops :) - I just get nervous.  I brought my car in for service earlier this month, told them that the light had come on then gone off after about a week, and (long story short) they didn't even check the code.  The guy just assumed it was the seal around the gas input.  The light came back on a week later.  Grrrr.<br /><br />So, I started looking around for a code reader.  When I was offered a chance to try this out, I was excited to see if it would work very well.  I'm happy to say that it works perfectly when hooked up to my Android phones.  Seriously - it's just perfect.<br /><br />There are a few free apps available, and others that you can buy for a small amount of money, that run on Android (and I'm assuming iOS, but I didn't look for those).  This adapter connects using WiFi only, so you won't be able to use any of the apps that only connect over Bluetooth, and there are a few of those.  I've been using an app called &#34;Piston&#34; that is free and has so far done everything that I need.  It's not real graphical with dials and such, instead just having digital readouts showing information.  However, it does update real time, so I was able to watch various parameters like my speed, rpm, coolant temperature, intake temperature, and so forth while I was driving (I had my phone mounted on my windshield).<br /><br />Using this is incredibly easy.  You don't even remotely have to be a techno genius to get this going.  Here are the steps:<br />(1) Install an app on your Android or iOS device that will work with a WiFi ODB II adapter, such as the &#34;Piston&#34; app for Android<br />(2) Locate the OBD port in your car.  If you don't know where it is, the manual or (even easier) the internet can show you.  I just used Google to check where mine was, and a picture popped right up<br />(3) Plug this adapter into the OBD port (I've attached a picture showing mine attached)<br />(4) Turn on your ignition.  I think mine worked after I turned the key but hadn't yet fully started the car, but I do forget<br />(5) The first time that you use it, scan for WiFi networks on your phone/tablet/PC to find this device.  This adapter generates its own network, so it doesn't need to join an existing one.  Rather, you join its network.  I don't know if they are all the same, but mine shows up as &#34;CLKDevices&#34; (see attached picture).  Connect to that WiFi network from your phone/tablet/PC<br />(6) Launch the app that you installed in Step 1.  If you are using Piston, there's an icon near the top of the screen that shows the front of a car and cable with a plug on the end.  Hit that icon to connect to the adapter<br /><br />Now, just use the app to check for fault codes or read real-time information (see attached picture for an example).  The instructions for the app should explain how to do those things.  You can even clear fault codes using this (which I did after checking it).<br /><br />The only thing on my wish list is that this would also work over Bluetooth just so that I wouldn't have to disconnect from my regular WiFi network, and also that I could use additional apps with it.  That's a small nit, though, given how easily it is to get working and well it works.<br /><br />I got to try this for free, but had a bought this for $30 (current price), I would still be ecstatic about it.  Being able to check out why my engine light was on was well worth that to me, and being able to get real-time data as I drive is just icing on the cake.  I can't recommend this enough.<br /><br />If you have any questions about the adapter or how to get it working, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.  Thanks!<br /><br />(I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.)o the OBD port (I've attached a picture showing mine attached) (4) Turn on your ignition.

B001J4ZY0C|5|&#34;SO FAR, SO GOOD&#34;
B00GP8IJEU|4|Im a saab fanatic and I love it. only reason I don't give it 5 stars. I thought I would be like a carhart type fabric and don't like elastic band at bottom (personal thing). other than that love it.
B00LNIPAIU|5|great :)
B00J1VG152|5|Work great.
B00VNBEJ1G|5|Awesome!  These are super bright and  make any and all reflective surface show up! Caution, you may need to adjust your headlights after installation as I found out! I was pulled over for too bright of lights,
B00CAV1KD8|5|Solved the problem perfectly!
B002T5TH5I|5|I have been using it on my 2008 Saturn Sky since I bought it new and I have driven over 282,000 miles.  It seems to be an amazing product.  I would recommend it at every oil change for the life of your car.
B0100F7QOC|4|I've seen other reviews about this particular product in regards to the video quality so I automatically deducted 1 star that for the lack of 1080p @60fps let get down to the real part. For one I've confirmed that using a 128 micro SD card does in fact work perfectly fine for this particular unit. Audio quality seems to be pretty good out loud enough to hear you're out side noises but also still hear your music playing I truly recommend this device for any novice writers who was just trying to find a cheap solution to an expensive hobby.
B00DNVY92S|5|Good price~
B00K53D7PC|5|Great product
B000IYNV5E|5|Exact fit for my 2001 Honda Civic Ex. Soo much cheaper than anywhere else
B002XN9PLW|5|They should start putting led bulbs in all cars as they are safer brighter and use less energy.
B00Q2Z2GUY|5|Just what I wanted
B00192QB9M|5|These are the best NEMA 14-50 sockets I could find and the price is the best here!
B009IYV0JO|5|Work excellent
B00DJ5KGRU|5|FAST SHIIPING GREAT ITEM !! PERFECT FIT FOR MY BIKE...
B00ZR55A0I|5|This inverter is very helpful and it is very easy to use. Perfectly fits in my cup holder. Thumbs up.
B00068XCQU|5|works great
B00029XC1I|5|Show your Patriotism, these are very durable and last about 5-6 years before the sun gets to them.  I mount them on my car rear wing windows, just like the airlines do!!  Been doing since 1987!!!  ON the DODGE MAN VAN since 2001!!!  Very durable!!  Show your colors!!!  Ken
B000C8T96Q|4|Good to have it. Easy to replace
B00PJPHEBO|1|Bluetooth works, but ODB II not ....  Have other and works.. so it is flauty unit.
B007ZLLKG0|5|EVERYTHING WAS GREAT
B00S4HFNXK|4|These are great little versatile bumpers, in some situations, they work better than the usual round bumpers, we used them on the family pontoon boat which needed some additional protection from the narrow dock it is parked in, and they were very easy to use and did the trick well. You could just as easily attach them to the dock rather than the boat, and the flat shape allows them to be stored easily, while the hinge on them allows for use around areas of the boat or dock that normal straight bumpers would not be flexible enough for. They were ideal for a slow moving boat like a large pontoon boat, probably not quite so ideal for faster crafts.
B00MVMMIA0|1|Wow, these suck! They look great when you first put them in, but after using them for a few minutes in an RV with an Onan generator, they burn out. Cost a lot, not worth crap!
B008RATKIS|3|The reason for the 3 stars is because it looks great after the install but it is not at all easy to install. No extra parts included so I had to find something in my garage after I lost a couple. I agree with the last review because they are very small and hard to hold onto while pinching and getting the screw started. What should be a 10 minute project very much so did also take me much longer. After I was completely finished the hood no longer closed. I took everything apart and started over. The only way to get it to close gently and stay flush is to remove all foam protection or rubber. The hood finally closed after screwing the bug shield on very tightly.
B006TMR5MO|3|Product looks good but for some reason fits loosely?? Am I missing another part? Maybe a rubber gasket or cushion? I'm afraid it's going to eventually shake loose and I'll be in the same situation.
B002C4W2JO|4|This is a heavy-feeling, sturdy little wrench kit that doesn't take up a lot of space in your tool bag. It has a load of different sizes, both metric and standard, such that I have yet to run into a hex-bolt this couldn't turn.
B003UT822G|5|If you change your own oil, you need this. Say goodbye to cleaning up. I have this valve on all my vehicles. Attach a hose to the nipple, route it to your oil catch, open the valve and go make yourself a sandwich. Come back in 15 minutes, change your filter, close the valve and add your oil. DONE! Don't think, buy.
B00852684M|2|work poor

B001TJ9IFO|5|Good Stuff. Worked really well!
B000CQRNXO|5|Excellent
B00I4R25IG|2|Poor quality - should have expected as much for the price.  They are not the sticky.  I'll be surprised if they last more that a couple months outside.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|I have been using these for several months now...so time to let you know how great they are. I volunteer for an organization that retrieves used motorized wheelchairs/scooters from folks that no longer need them. We deliver them to another bunch of volunteers that refurbish them. We then donate them to people who can't get them through another source. These are the best ramps I have ever used. They are light and strong and have not buckled at all. I have probably loaded more than 100 chairs in the back of my Honda Ridgeline without a hitch. In addition, I recently had to transport my 10 KW portable generator for service. This beast weighs in at about 500 lbs. and 2 buddies and I rolled it right up with no issues. In the winter I will probably be using it to haul my 24&#34; snowblower around to relatives. The extra length makes a huge difference between bottomig out at the top and a smooth transition to the truck.<br /><br />The literature references a 1,500 lb. limit. I have not had that much weight on it but don't forsee an issue. The center rail on each ramp appears to be carrying the lion's share of the weight, so better to ensure tires on whatever you're loading are centered as much as possible. Skinny tires on a heavy load that ride either side of that rail may bend the cross treads. Those treads are well corrugated and loads do not slip. Highly recommend using the safety straps provided. I tie them off to the bully bar on my trailer hitch.<br /><br />All in all...great purchase. Highly recommend.
B0024NSGYS|5|great price and good quality.
B0079MKI4K|3|This E-ZPass holder for the older style motorcycle transponders is easy to install and works very well. However, I feel the price is high for such a simple designed mount. Also I ordered a black one and the paint is peeling off after only a short time.
B0031BSI8G|5|Great item and easy install
B005Z82LNG|5|We used this over the weekend. Worked wonderful for us!
B00KI4PWHE|5|this is the best long lasting smell:)
B00BNB6T7I|5|Just what I was looking for. Worth the money I paid. Thank you!
B000CFS028|2|purchased in May and the air bag has a leak within 2 months and doesn't hold air.
B003RQBKLC|1|Too plasticky, looks like a toy.
B00S4QSNQ0|5|Hook was exactly what I need to hang my purse on the back of the front seat.  It keeps me from having to turn all the way around and practically climb to get my purse. Perfect fit for my MINI Cooper Countryman.
B0002MAGLY|2|Misleading, it is NOT the blue bulb! It does work in place of my burned out blue bulb, however only one of my lights went out so now I have a yellowish light (this one) on one side and the original blueish light on the other. Considering returning this.
B00EDFM5QU|5|The original led ' s that I put in my toy hauler were to blue and didn't put out enough light. These are much closer to a normal bulb and the light is perfect for what I want. The light are only on one side so thay the light is focused out.
B000COCTXA|4|Just bought a van that had the whole windshield washer kit missing, and this solved the problem! Works well with the Dorman Washer hose kit, but the recommended Anco washer tubing kit that was recommended was too small.
B00RSP6ZXG|1|Looks nothing like the picture at all
B006YLO52S|5|Always  great product.
B003AOTO7S|5|Excellent
B008427D88|1|Did not fit the holes on my 2010 Ram 1500. They were too big.
B00SGFZCTA|5|Had this Valet KeyChain for 7 days now, works as it should, sliding mechanism smooth and secure as I need it.  Would recommend this for those that like to slide it on your belt.
B00EC0Z4XM|2|The mirror seems to be distorted. It works for the price, but you get what you pay for. I busted my current mirror, but the housing was all good and i just needed the glass. I ordered this part because it seemed like a good deal; which it was. But the mirror is not perfect, i can compare it to a mirror you would see in a haunted house.
B00W8W7CRM|5|Love my gloves!!  Searched high and low thought I'd have to do without, thanks Amazon!!!!
B00H2ZCU86|5|Perfect upgrade for your neglected ABC suspension. When combined with a hydraulic fluid flush this filter will extend the life of your ABC suspension.
B0049ZDDLA|4|Has worked great for my wife to listen to podcasts in the CTS. We had to get an additional adapter for the newer iPhone plug to work.
B000VI071S|5|I  purchased this last year and never gave a review, glad to do this now.  Long story short, my 2010 Dodge van has everything BUT a compass.  I got annoyed at that and tried several models.  In one of my previous lives , I operated small planes, which ALL had backup WET compasses, is what they were called , and this one is even the most favored coloration of the compass face, only downside , not lighted. But at this price really reasonable.  On my MAN VAN, it works best AND  QUITE ACCURATE middle of the dash, pushed foreward toward the wind screen about 6 inches, just like many small planes!!  I cleaned the dash area with alcohol and purchased the heavy duty hook and loop stuff that the EZ pass people send you to mount your pass, at Home Depot.  Since my first Van in 2001, and travelling all over this great nation of ours, I feel it is VERY important to be aware of OUTSIDE AIR TEMP AND COMPASS DIRECTION AS A BACK-UP TO YOUR GPS!!!  Enuff said, highly recommended for workable apps!!  KEN
B00HGVOU66|3|Very comfortable, just got done with a 1300 mile trip. But a big negative ..it is not waterproof. Leave it in the rain and you will have swamp ass..water will seep back up through the stitching. For the money that this seat cost,<br />I think Mustang could throw in a cover.
B00HCROOR4|5|fit great work good
B00B9EV99M|5|I got this for my son, I guess it worked fine, he got it about a month ago and it's still on his car, plus he got an inspection done so....I assume everything is as it should be.
B008KWP6MC|5|Gr8
B0038Z7K0M|1|Should logically come with the cross beam piece in order for it to function. No have to find missing metal cross piece. I came to find out that other merchants have it and it includer bar which is riveted on!
B00V9KI7UU|1|Picture shows this as long as a sofa but it's nowhere near that big. Very deceiving and not a way to sell anywhere. Typical bait and switch. My local vinyl cutter can make the one I received for $8. If I could rate this 0 stars I would. Pitty.
B004RSZR0Y|5|It's going to go on my husbands truck, and for now I am going with a 5 star, I'll change it later if needed, once it's on and being used.
B0090B7M2O|3|Autel told me that the MD802 I purchased was a China version and they do not have the software or technical support to rsolve my problem. My problem was the md802 keep asking VIN number of my Honda Odyssey over and over again. This version is good for Europe cars only.
B00NJ9MZH0|4|I replaced the standard headlight bulbs in my Club Car Precedent cart with these. They are as bright if not better and give a white light in stead of the standard off white.
B00HJEUUKU|1|They fit very loose. They do not make a good connection.
B000EDUUHQ|2|Don't fit very good and are wobbly - doesn't stay in place when extended.
B006Q7C7L6|2|This is strictly a battery charger. Do not use it directly to power any device. Since its advartised as a 5watt panel I was under the assumption it should have no problem powering a 12v 3watt water pump. At peak sunlight I was able to measure about 21 volts but it drops to about 2.5v if I hook it up to a voltage regulator.
B00Q34DGI0|5|excelent
B002UC8OEK|5|Replaced my brittle plastic curtain pulls with these. They are tough
B004JAXPYA|1|Blew out within a day of installation.
B0097SUFTW|5|good
B008BVVY1O|1|Did not fit seats and had to send back .Very disappointed in product .
B002X1PNRY|5|Not the first time we had to order the handle... and not because the first one failed.  Our original Sequoia (2003) was totaled last year (in 2014; never had a problem with that metal hatch after replacing it).  We replaced the 2003 with a 2006.  Weather changed (winter to spring) and the same thing happen (have no idea why Toyota didn't think to put a hatch release near the driver side of the vehicle like they did for other smaller vehicles or simply use the metal option... go figure). Youtube has awesome how 2s that refresh our memory on how to replace.  I wouldn't suggest the one that has you cut a hole in the license plate area!!!  Took less than 2 hours to replace (suspended on account of rain) and for less than $20.
B00OOJGY0I|5|On time and look very nice on my wheels
B006ULI1QI|5|Wife loved it
B0085DPSGK|5|Worked perfectly!
B0081SB746|5|Exact fit, good quality for generic version.
B0052FRT2A|1|Ya, these are the cheapest things I have ever seen. Do not even fit quite right.  Won't be getting these ever again.
B000N9VF6Q|4|It worked very well
B006EGAIII|5|Worked great for our van
B007N9K7YA|5|great
B00RW2JBO0|5|Perfect fit, High quality, looks great as the original.<br /><br />Tony<br />Virginia Beach,VA
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product. Covers the whole window.
B001O77CMW|4|I have a burgman 400. The box is great. The bracket not so much. I had to drill additional holes in the bracket to make it work. I<br />The bolts did fit the pre installed nuts on the scooter. There are many holes in the bracket. But none of them matched the pre installed holes.
B000E35UV2|5|It's very very good buy it
B00TO9H66O|3|dose not hold ice like it showed in reviews
B0065M5GJ2|1|Cap was of good quality,  the sizing chart available by Amazon said it was for my vehicle and it was not the correct size. So now i have a VW paper clip holder on my desk.
B00F8LEB9W|1|Don't work
B00YB5GAEA|2|I was looking for a good warning light for daytime riding and this isn't it. It is effective for only a short distance. It is supposed to have three lighting functions but only two of them worked. Expensive and not recommended
B0009V1WQQ|1|One cuff is now permanently locked and won't come off of my scooter. I will not use these again.
B00UBIMGSK|5|Awesome product
B00VVR4LII|5|Very nice and rides smoothly
B004R36OV0|5|Plug and play.
B000CP8Q68|5|FANTASTIC
B00029JL5O|5|excellent
B00IPS3GMI|5|Used on 2011 bmw and 2003 bmw. Actually gives longer lasting performance than genuine bmw 5w30 full synthetic. Word to the wise, you need 7 to 8 quarts for bmw's with Xdrive. Price was amazing.
B001HRB3PQ|5|Great part. I hate when car manufactures put such a time bomb into beautiful cars. So much hassle to replace $5 part!  I was ashamed when my BMW would leave oil spots everywhere I go. So, Valve cover gasket, CCV and this one and your BMW will be &#34;spotless&#34;
B009279Z6W|5|as promised!
B00029X0XS|1|Thrash!  Simply thrash.  Comes off within a very short time. Waste!
B000C9QCYC|5|AC Delco really is professional grade. One of the best rated in independent studies for flow and filtration. This unit fits perfectly for 4.0L sohc Ford Rangers and installation is easy. AC Delco products have never let me down and I will continue to purchase them.
B00GN5BEII|5|Good quaulity
B00K0VMXDQ|4|Haven't had the need to jump my Polaris Ranger or Rzr but now I have a back up. Was impressed with all the attachments that came with the kit.
B00KCQSIRY|1|i got the solid black covers. They have a strong chemical smell that won't go away with febreeze or airing out. Even though the seller confirms it fits my car it didn't due to the arm rest and center consoles. Material is thin, probably wouldn't have lastest long anyway. Horrible product, look for another brand.
B00KTIUM88|5|East installation instruction, shipped fast and great price.
B0087NB2OU|2|I wish it had longer or adjustable wraparound for my head. It might fit better and I would be able to hear better. I use these to listen to audio books on my iPod while riding my Can Am.
B000P17NXQ|5|I purchased this unit to use with my 2014 Nissan Pathfinder and my hybrid camper trailer.  I debated purchasing a slightly less expensive unit but I am so glad that I did not.  I have used this unit for about a year now and it works flawlessly.  I was especially pleased with how easy it is to configure and use. I've started towing a few different trailers with very different braking strengths and changing the settings on this unit for use with different trailers is incredibly easy.  One less important and yet nice feature to have is just how easy this unit is to disconnect.  It comes with a little storage case that I can store it in while not using it.  Since I only tow 2 or 3 times a month, I like keeping the unit stored in my glove box when not in use.  I really don't believe there is anything else out there that is comparable to this unit.
B00NV5DATO|2|not bright enough
B00FJPBQWM|5|It's a Mazda Titanium Touch Up Paint Pen
B002OWCLNQ|5|Very nice and arrived on time
B00L40ZQGS|4|Nice little fan. We use it on our boat and it creates a nice breeze in the cabin.  Would have given it 5 stars except the materials are slightly flimsy but appropriate for the cost.  No problems with delivery--it arrived early.
B0049B0KQU|5|great fit for my Fit
B000GU5LSK|5|Looks great.  Fits great.
B010MNRLDS|4|Looks great thank you
B00SH1SN6C|5|We've been chasing an electrical bug in our car that drains the battery quickly. This battery has saved us multiple times already and jumps the car easily.
B00P1O4LNC|5|Works great, I've been casually trying to melt the silicone and have been unsuccessful. The lighter/accessory thing comes right off if you're not into that sort of thing.
B00BITKHHS|5|Perfect fit.<br />No problems
B000PENLT8|5|This is the best prep solvent in my opinion
B000B68C08|5|Easy to replace.
B000EQAT74|4|Nicely built, packaged well. They install perfectly and are a great replacement for my 100k+ mile originals!
B00IPS4APU|5|I had only modest expectations when I bought this to repair a star-shaped break on my windshield. My wife has had repairs done before on her car windshield, and I never could tell that the break looked any better after being repaired.  With this kit, I repaired the break according to the instructions and now I can barely see the break.  I will be using this again and recommend it.
B00T1YADSU|2|Flood casts a broad field of light, good for up close, but not at a distance of 100ft or more.
B008KZKHZ0|5|Perfect fit. Thanks!
B005JUWU22|5|Great quality fuel systems
B009SF0FWQ|5|A very nice alternative to bumper stickers.  Elegant looking and wont peel or fade.  Installation was easy and straight forward.  I placed it on the back of my auto under a chrome Eagle Globe and Anchor I purchased at the same time, they look great together Showing my Marine pride couldn't be easier.
B002D3KR4Q|5|Nice fit looks great !
B00T6X62ZE|4|Good material .
B004JKX4X2|5|Arrived right on time for my Florida trip, we drove from Michigan to Florida and back with it lots of rain, lots of sun. It held up to the challenge very well
B0012BL8LG|5|Awesome. Use to convert car cooler when we go into a hotel or campsite.
B000C543EW|5|No issues, fit like a charm
B00SLKD55S|5|Worked great!!
