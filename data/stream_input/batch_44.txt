0345472322|1|It appears the author presented her findings and then just repeats the same lines over and over and over again.  I was concerned with the use of some of the names the author includes of people used as examples, especially the negative examples.  The author does not hint whether she actually spoke to or interview them and whether these individuals authorized the use of their names.<br /><br />I made it to half of the book, and I went that far just to give it a chance.
B0012HF5NC|5|One of the best movies that I watch with my Sci-Fi collection.
B00KTDD69A|3|Its Fun.
B00IMYZOBQ|3|I liked the movie, but for all the hype I surely expected much more.  It's like really bad luck over and over and well, enough already.  In this day you would think there would be some back up plan but nada.  Couple heart warming parts but over all its a Lifetime channel movie at best and a good but slight part played be the handsome George Cloney.  Special effects are amazing, but needs much more to glue the movie together.
B002SSUQFG|5|nice watch
B00992CF6W|5|One problem and that it needs horses asap and updates should come sooner other than that it's the best game ever!!!
B00RFHUCY0|2|I am not a fan of musicals...
B000000WJK|5|It is truly hard to believe that this album was released in '93.   The sound is so timeless, whereas any other '93 (or other era) grunge/rap/pop related music is instantly discernable as to the when and where of it all.   The Verve managed to produce a seminal album that will seem as vibrant and timely many years into the future.   My freshman year of college would have been quite different had I never stumbled upon this record at School Kids record store in Athens, OH.   Truthfully, this album will not be for everyone, there hasn't been or ever will be an album created that will manage to please the masses, just look at the swill that goes platinum now.   But, the comparisons to the best of Pink Floyd and Stone Roses aren't far off the mark.   Come see what the beginning of the second British invasion was really about in the mid-90s.   This is one of those albums that just fell through the cracks because (thankfully) it wasn't something MTV could latch onto and promote to death.   If you enjoy music, and are looking for a 10 year old breath of fresh air, just listen to the 1st note from Star Sail and you'll know you are in for a hell of a ride. <br />Adios...
034580404X|5|I was really taken aback by the first book, but as I continued to read I begain to understand the psychological trauma of Fifty and what true love can accomplish.<br />I would recommend to all adult readers.
B00HYTSTNU|5|Tom Hanks is always one of my favorites, and again, he delivered a top performance. This was very well done and I enjoyed it a lot.
B00FCQQ1IW|4|Frustrating because we have to wait for what is to come.<br />I like all the character's and eager to see what Sebastian becomes.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|It's very enjoyable and I keep true to beat it.  The game keeps changing so you can't figure out the way to beat it, you just have to keep trying.
B002QE3CTY|4|It gives a thought provoking adventure about who you truly are, when who you think you are is stripped away.

B00GY0HJ4K|4|Fun game. A little confusing at times but still fun.I like that you can move diagonally on this game. Better than candy crush!
B005R32L66|5|oh ya i love skype most for talking to my daughter that lives in Tn.<br />and im in Az. with a new grandbaby bo<br /><br />y coming it means even more helpful
B000089RVX|5|Evanescence is probably one of the first CDs I've bought in months &amp; was well worth it!  It is refreshing to finally have something a bit different to listen to and that I can actually relate to unlike much mainstream music today!  I know Evanescence will be around for a long time because of how talented the group is - between writing their own songs and Amy Lee's voice (you should hear her live!) Evanescence is a good buy and well worth supporting - you won't be disappointed!
B008RA3X5E|5|love it!
B00005JPUN|3|To me, this is a remake to the Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1956, and NOT to the 1978 version. Although, I haven't seen the original yet, it's probably a good thing so I wouldn't have to compare them. My dad is a fan of the original, and I don't think he liked this version as well. I love that toward the beginning of the movie, it takes place on HALLOWEEN. Nichole Kidman and Daniel Craig did a pretty good job. I'd probably recommend THE INVASION!!!
B009KS4XRO|4|I really love this game. I play it every day. I am addicted to it. I hate when it freezes in the middle of the game and I have bingos that I cant collect on. I wish you would correct this problem. I have played other bingo apps and none of them ever freeze.
B00KCUY7CU|5|If you are new to Sia, or wondering if you should buy this, here is my opinion:<br />I am a guy and I mainly listen to rock and I love this album! This is total pure intense emotion! This is not the typical mainstream pop woohoo dance music.<br /><br />How I understand it is after her last 2010 album she at some point had some personal stuff she went through, retired and only wanted to be behind the scenes writing for other artists. This is her back out of retirement album and it is in full force! This may explain the new Sia, where she refuses to show her face. When you mix these songs visually with the amazing Maddie, something very powerful happens.<br /><br />This an artist's expression and she does it through pop music. Her vocals are exceptional and quite unique actually. She does this interesting voice cracking thing like you'd hear from Bjork and Alanis Morissette, but Sia does it her own way and it really adds to the song. This isn't just amazing vocal ability, Sia has a very profound style and personality that comes through. These lyrics are deep! I can't emphasize that enough. This is not about &#34;If you liked it than you should have put a ring on it.&#34; This is intense!  I mean, it is called 1000 Forms of Fear. You know when you hear a song that makes you feel intense powerful emotion in your chest and maybe explodes to your head and you want to cry it is so beautiful? Welcome to Sia!<br /><br />I would say Sia is an artist in the way Peter Gabriel, Trent Reznor and Bjork are artists. Their music is more than just songs, if you know what I mean. Fair Game sounds like Peter Gabriel could have sung it on his Security album.<br /><br />It goes without saying Chandelier and Elastic Heart are absolute masterpieces. Admit it, they bring tears to your eyes! A great example of a song that sounds brilliant in headphones. I mean, listen to that weird melody sounding thing during the verses. I don't know what that sound is but it's very cool.<br /><br />This album is dark, sad, intense, with some joy sprayed in, but make no mistake, this is not a party album. This is real music with real emotion! You may find yourself crying to part of it or at least tearing up. I suggest put on some good headphones and blast off! Listen to the whole thing all the way through from Chandelier to the final song, Dressed in Black. Sia's voice wails, soars, and deeply expresses throughout!<br /><br />Hostage sounds like an 80s Cure song and may be the most upbeat on the album, but it is the darker stuff I like the best. Fair Game has really interesting layered harmonies with what sounds like Indonesian Gamalon being played. Again, something Peter Gabriel used in San Jacinto.<br /><br />The pounding electronic bass in Dressed in Black is memorizing!<br /><br />I haven't come to like Free the Animal yet, but it is definitely unique and maybe it will grow on me.<br /><br />Sia is in her late 30s here, so this isn't some 23 year old out fresh out of the gate trying to get instant fame. She is a grown up and this is mature music. This is not something you put on in the background while doing upside down keg stands at some Frat party. This is an advanced album musically, lyrically and production wise.<br /><br />For those of you not into pop music, this isn't Madonna simple girly pop, this is beautiful music that just has a pop style. Some I don't even know if I would classify it as pop, but just Sia. I get the feeling this is filled with very personal lyrics from Sia, in a similar way Amy Lee's lyrics are in Evanescence. But it is the delivery with mega amounts of tear jerking emotion by Sia on top of very intense powerful music that makes this the best album I have heard in a long time!<br /><br />Sia if you by any chance read this review, thank you for such a brilliant album that provides us with so much emotion, and I hope you do a tour for this album as I can't even imagine how amazing it would be to see these songs played live.
B006LSZECO|5|Couldn't put it down! One of my favorite reads ever.  A real twist in the story which I really love.
B00N35P5MW|5|Only to stop being asked to rate.
B006LSZECO|4|Without giving away too much, this story was pretty good--as you learn more about the 2 main characters, you realize they really deserve each other.  It is written in an interesting &#34;he said-she said&#34; style but still has surprises throughout the course of the story.  My only issue with the story is its increasingly cynical tone which is kind of a bummer after a while.  But it's a pretty good read.
B0025KVLUQ|5|This CD is a replacement for 1)my vinyl version which is now an heirloom, and 2)the first CD copy I had which was &#34;borrowed&#34; by my son a little over a year ago.
B006YG9HJE|5|I have been a fan of this series since its inception.<br /><br />Although it sometimes exceeds reality in the abilities of the characters to accomplish some of their undertakings. It is a source of good entertainment.
B0091XT2VK|4|Pretty cool while taking classes on ancient political thought.
B001QTXM5Y|4|The movie itself gets 5 stars, just to clear the air.<br />The Ultimate Edition is coming out in December.<br />I knew this was coming and I'm such a fanboy that I don't mind the double-dip because I can't wait for such things to come out. What angered me was getting the $10 off coupon THAT YOU CAN ONLY REDEEM ONLINE ONLY AT THE WARNER BROTHERS STORE!!!!!! Treat your fans better and make the coupon an in-store coupon you can use anywhere!!!<br />I'll give this edition to a buddy of mine who's too cheap to buy his own DVD's once the Ultimate Edition comes out.
B005LAIIKI|4|Django brings a different language to a story we have heard a million times before. Quentin Tarantino is brilliant in his ability to bring humor and clarity to a serious and dramatic story. Quentin's rendition of history makes it relatable to all audiences and not only African Americans.<br /><br />The leading role is played by Jamie Foxx who is in search of his wife who has been sold by a slave master. He begins this journey with this corky doctor who is also a bounty hunter. The doctor makes him a deal of helping to find his wife if he will work with him. While on this journey they encounter some major slave traders who also have his wife held captive. Django must come up with a plan that will save the woman he loves but also helps him to get out freely as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie for the most part. There are some scenes that are overly dramatic and the language is rather vulgar. If you are familiar with Tarantino's style then he is at his rarest form. I will say this is one of those movies you will either hate it or love it. Very entertaining from beginning to end. Several fight scenes throughout the movie. This movie is for adult eyes only.
B009EEFTMC|5|My granddaughters and I call this the Pretty Game.  It is addictive and relaxing.  What does the movie camera Icon do at the bottom of the screen?  It seems to straighten the cube but sometimes it moves to another face of it?  Love the app!
B000NA28IE|1|Good grief. I would easily give this movie \\"0\\" stars if it was an option. These books are fun and it's inspiring that a teenager could write them. They are enjoyable to read and Mr. Paolini has quite the vision. But the movie just feels like, \\"quick! let's cash in on LOTR and be done with it\\". I know it's not fair to compare books and movies of those books but, come on! They dropped SO much plot and detail and it was all over sooooo fast! I couldn't even believe the ending! This belongs in the same realm as the debacle that was \\"The Beach\\", another horrific adaptation of a great book. And I certainly hope that one of the reviewers who said it was \\"every bit as good as LOTR\\" hasn't seen or read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If they have then, shame on you!
B00BSBR9N6|5|This was a wonderfully written originally charming book. Always wonderful to find a unique story line that presents another side.
0345451325|5|This book has sucked me in, I can't put it down.  If the thought of the game entices you, you should read this book to give you the more complete sensation when playing the game.<br />The book tells of how the SPARTANS were picked, trained, and &quot;augmented,&quot; as well as their missions BEFORE getting to Halo.
B00BD99JMW|5|Loved this whole series. The end was unexpected and surprisingly emotional. The book definitely kept me interested through the whole thing.
B00LP9E79U|3|I didn't like the ending.
B0090SI460|5|While I had high expectations for this 3D experience they may have been to high. The movie is beautiful and the 3D is great but there is more potential behind this 3D movie than is tapped.
0143038419|5|At the age of thirty-one, Gilbert realizes that she does not want to stay married or have a child. Instead, she decides to embark on a journey of self-discovery.<br />This book is a self help book, a travel memoir and a biography. Gilbert documents her travels in Italy, India and Bali and writes about her thoughts, actions and the people she meets.<br />The work is well-written and entertaining.
B006LSZECO|4|Ben Affleck was great in the book.  Where is she? Gone girl.
B00F7YHDWC|3|I mean this game is ok but like for real is this really the best amazon can do for their kindle fires?? I see apps on the featured app of the day where not even one person has wrote a review about. I mean like come on is angry birds and minecraft really the best you can do?? I demand better apps at least apps that are somewhat up to date like for real you don't even have infinity blade or pac man this just shows that we should be able to choose what app store we want to use not the irrational amazon appstore in which the 4th best free app is a game no one who uses apple has ever heard of so to amazon get it together and get some apps going on with no ripoffs PLEASE
B00JP5ONY0|4|great movie! Interesting in it's character development and insights into human nature and interactions. Would definitely recommend it. Gave some good lighthearted moments.
1442337966|5|These are such powerful CD's.  I listen to them often.  It helps you turn your day or week around.  Helps you redirect your thinking.
B0000YB7Z8|5|Jethro Tull is a extremely unique band in several aspects! Everyone who likes rock knows that.<br />But the quality of this album is impressive! To think that they record it in a tour throughout Europe, several different shows in a analog 8-tracks device! Ian and his troop are always amazing!
B004ZN9NCY|5|Just like I remembered it...It's been years, but I enjoy hearing it again.  Have to be a Pink Floyd fan to appreciate this.
B00IX9UTLU|5|Okay so I loved it.  I enjoyed all the twists and turns. I felt it had a great blend of family crisis mixed in with the drama and romance. I felt Laynie stayed true to her character through the series....however at one point in the third book I became very frustrated with her. I felt after seeing the video she should have had a deeper reaction and been more willing to leave or to stand by her guard as Lauren had suggested.  It troubled me that she caved and did not stand strong. To me I felt she needed to be stronger there and then show weakness privately.  As far as Hudson goes I was always put off by his character and I felt glad to be able to hate him in the end. I will recommend this series I absolutely loved it! I can't wait to read Hudson so I can get his point of view and then maybe I will grow to like his character better.
B00499NHLC|5|Very entertaining.  &#34;Sherlock&#34; speaks so rapidly, he could speak up a little. Can't wait for the new season to start.
B0058YPL66|5|I found the premise of this series intriguing. I loved the idea of fairy tail characters going from the past to the present. The faiytale characters are not exactly what we all grew up with. They are fleshed out and have good back stories. Everyone is not perfect but there is good versus evil at play. Mr. Gold and Regina are great as the villains. Even with all the bad things they have done they have moments where they do good things and there is so much from their past that one can't help but feel sympathetic toward them. There are so many great characters and the acting is well done. The stories have many twists and turns. There is action, romance, and some magic along the way.
B000BTC5LW|5|I bought this for as a present and it was watched every night! Great concert video with all the good songs from the Pulse album :).<br /><br />The product came brand new in plastic wrapping and everything. Great low price as well!
B000W91RUG|5|It is a great show and i cant wait to get season 2 on dvd I try and catch every episode on tv and I really like the packaging it was perfect.
0375805613|5|i loved this book when i was little, my son loves hearing it now. my sister has even pulled it off the shelf and climbed back into her childhood. this book is a must have for every parent.
B00DURGZHW|3|I could not watch this movie passed the first 20 minutes, much too boring, just a lot of running by two boys
B0000CDJPQ|4|Was looking for an adapter that would allow my 8 year old video camera(which has firewire 400) to talk to iMovies on my MacBook Pro(that has firewire 800). The Sonnet firewire adapter works flawlessly and is great. The only niggle is that it is very light and does tend to get rocked by the firewire cable.<br />Amazons's service was top notch too, with the product being delivered well before the date promised.
1451666179|5|Fast, Funny and Fresh!  I love everything about this book - so much so that I've purchased 4 additionally for family & friends.
B00QROH0QK|4|Great story.
0895260131|5|Spot on and propaganda free. Have lived and worked extensively in the Middle East and find no fault in the history or explanation of Islamic Doctrine. One may understand Democracy and Communism but without the additional understanding of Islam one can not begin to understand today's headlines. A MUST READ addition to your bookshelf.  But two copies, you will want to share...
B00B2V66VS|5|This is really one of the best games ever you should get temple run 2<br />You will love this game
B005BHNCO8|2|Pros:<br />. Works.<br />. Cost effective<br /><br />Cons:<br />. The stand is very light. feels like it can be broken very easily.<br />. The plastics are very cheep. even when you untie them, they still hold the pips tight.<br />. Umbrella is small.<br />. The mechanism of removing the black reflector is very bad.<br />. Flash holder doesn't have lock hole neither pressure plate to hod the flash securely. I had my flash fallen!
0802473156|5|The book was in great condition.
B0052BZ6X8|3|Really great story line, hope there is a sequel. They had some great special effects but some really slow and boring parts...
B00ICF0OZQ|5|Everyone loved this game!  It was a big hit with all involved.  I can't wait to get an 8 player game going.  I suggest naming the camels.  We are even going to try a game with everyone putting in 10 dollars each to raise the stakes and the fun even more!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3|This has a lot of interesting historical information in it that gives you a better understanding of what life was like when Jesus was alive. It paints the Bible in a totally different light if you understand the historical context. But that said, it does a lot of &#34;we  don't really know anything historical about Jesus, but here's what we know about.  . .everything else going on in that time period&#34;.
B0064MPXFA|5|Great show. Not at all what I expected from the title.
B00M7UTFW0|2|Pretty damn bad until the end I guess
B00DHKKN6Q|4|Easy laid back game to pass the time. Cute graphics. Music and sounds annoying. But I just turned them off.
B007N85POS|5|My children love the game
B00F8GYC1Y|5|Great game! Especially it is free now! So there is no reason not to download it. My boy friend love it.
B00AREIAI8|5|It is incredible!🐴💛💟
0143120530|4|Josh Foer's book [[ASIN:B004Q9JQGA Moonwalking with Einstein]] follows the author, who was a fresh-out-of-college journalist at the time, on his journey into the world of competitive memory training. Each chapter explores a different theme under the umbrella of memory and cognition, with plenty of humorous stories as well as practical tips. In parallel is an account of his own personal training for the US Memory Championships.<br /><br />Overall it was a very compelling book, easy to pick up and hard to put down. Compared to other pop-science type books, i.e. Malcolm Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316057908 Blink]], I found this to be more accessible and relatable -- largely because Foer continually stresses how much of an average guy he is, and how the techniques he's learning were once the common domain of every educated person. In other words, there's a big \\"you can do this too!\\" theme in the book, and Foer provides plenty of how-to guides.<br /><br />I tried the techniques in this book, and they really did work! I read it a week ago, and I can still remember the \\"dummy list\\" Foer provided somewhere in the middle of the book: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, smoked salmon, six bottles of white wine... :) the technique really is easy to implement.<br /><br />At times I found the writing style to be a bit overwrought, where it seems like he's trying too hard to sound clever. But on the whole, the writing was enjoyable, and the story itself was one that I'll remember for a while. Highly recommended!
B000031EGV|5|I needed some Robin Williams movies, got this and Mrs. Doubtfire. Fun to watch.
B00005BF9Z|5|Whatever comparisons have been made with Clandestino (which I haven't heard) this is GREAT. I will never forget this summer in Barcelona with &quot;me gustas tu&quot; playing everywhere - even the street cleaners were blasting it out at 4am in the Barrio Gotico. It expresses my life - English with part french and part spanish/south american influences (me not him). Me gustas tu is also great for learning spanish vocabulary!!!! This album has changed my life - shame it will probably never be heard in the UK .....although I am spreading the word. Does anyone understand the album title? I EXPERIENCED it! Leaving Spain - sitting on the Madrid metro en route to the airport, listening to the album on my walkman - when the train pulls in at a station and THE voice says &quot;proxima estacion - Esperanza&quot; over the trains sound system.  Have to say I died and went to heaven on this music (cheap pink wine helps, so does being in Barcelona and sharing the music with south americans) and it keeps me bopping round the kitchen now I'm back in damp grey November (almost) weather trying to pay the bills and job-hunting ....Le Rendezvous is second best - clever and funny. Discovered the album by seeing the video of Me Gustas Tu in Valencia.  The video really makes it. Does anyone know how/where to get hold of the video? Or DVD?
B001LF3YQK|3|This is on ok wipe holder. Probably a little fancier than it needs to be. We ended up using a more straight forward one the fits into our babies fold up change area.

B008B1VYP0|5|This one is good from the beginning to the end! Payphone is my favorite song, and you should check it's video.
B00AYR2FOI|5|I choose this rating because this man has a voice like no other.  His renditions and appreciation of the Memphis sound speaks to his talent as a musician and singer.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Just being able to stream Netflix and Google Play content (music, movies, etc) makes it worth the $35.  Once the device mirroring options get ironed out and it gets Plex support its going to be a steal at that price.
B00OKYQZDI|5|So much fun.so hard to stop playing.
B00DJ80VLS|5|Listening to the Album the first time I had no comment. We can all agree that this album is different than any other effort DT has put. It needs a few spins to get it into your system and once it's there you cannot get it out.<br /><br />-False Awakening Suite is a strong Introduction musically intense.<br />-The Enemy Inside is probably the heavist song DT has ever made in their career.My Personal Favorite.<br />-Enigma Machine is the instrumental of this album the more you listen the more u love it<br />-Illumination theory is the reason why we all Love DT in the first place, this is a ride we all should enjoy.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this album is different, but in a good way. Needs a few spins to get it sucked in, and once it is sucked you cannot unlove it.<br />General Notes, Mangini is a Beast and his drumming is memorable. John Myung's touch is clear and the bass is great.
B000FC2ROU|5|This lovely piece of fiction features a teenage boy who flees his wealthy artist father and lands in an interesting new situation in the south of Japan. Kafka fills in some of the rubric from which Murakami works. Magical and fascinating.
044024367X|2|This is the first of the Jack Reacher series that I was really disappointed by. I finished it, but I'm still not sure what all was going on. I hope this is not a new trend for this series.
0375826726|5|I don't agree with the overly harsh critics who've nitpicked the book to death. I loved it! It was a great read, exciting and enthralling from beginning to end. I couldn't put the book down until I'd read the last page and it left me wanting more. What more can you ask of a great story? I am already impatient for the next book, and who cares if there are 4 instead of 3? More fun for us. It is a great adventure and I (unlike others) am not eager for it all to end. I look forward to the next book.    My only problems with the book, and they are minor, is that yes the opening sequence is pretty repulsive, didn't care for that. And secondly, I didn't like it that Eragon never checked on Elaine and tried to heal her or alleviate her discomfort. They mentioned several times how miserable she was and how dangerous her pregnancy was, but he just never got around to it and that bugged me.     Those two points aside, this is a great book. Buy it, Read it! You'll enjoy it and will be looking forward to the next one like I am.
B000EHSVSC|5|I love this one above all others, because I'm in it; running from the flight line with a co-worker! The shot is also in the movie Mid-way.

0736430512|5|It is a Little Golden Book about one of the biggest hit movies of the year, what is there not to like.  I have several Little Golden Books and read them to our children at bedtime, and this is currently one they really enjoy.
B004H4XDBI|3|A much better book than &#34;If I Stay&#34;, the 1st part of the story, but there are too many better young adult novels out there to waste your time on this one.
076532413X|4|In 2009 some of the world's leading research physicists gather at the CERN research facility to conduct an experiment using the Hardon Collider to \\"capture\\" the Higgs Boson subatomic particle.  The lead scientists Lloyd Simcoe and Theo Procopides anticipate success and a subsequent Nobel Prize.  However something occurs around the globe at the moment the atom smashing experiment begins.  Every human on earth who survives sees a two minute visionary clip of themselves in 2030.<br /><br />However, millions died when the collective sub-consciousness led to all types of accidents and disasters during the 120 seconds.  Simcoe is stunned more so with what he saw rather than the deadly fiasco the experiment caused.  He is engaged to marry one woman, but saw his wife of the future was another female.  Theo had no vision so he assumes he will be dead before 2030; he believes he will be a murder victim.  They try to replicate their experiment, but fail until they realize timing is everything as they go for a third try when a neutrino shower occurs as both want more information about the future regardless of cost.<br /><br />This is an engaging cautionary science fiction thriller that uses the Frankenstein concept of scientists having no ethical boundaries experimenting, even encouraged by the second and third times they replicated the experiment.  The story line is fast-paced and exciting, but chooses the thriller aspects over the emotional elements beyond a personal need to know. The two scientists know their experiment killed more people in two minutes than some of the monsters of history did during brutal reigns yet they don't seem to care on a personal level.  Still this is an exhilarating thriller as the world sees a flash forward moment and each reacts accordingly to what they prefer to see.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B008K6HN8I|5|Dose ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING you need in a file manager. it is by far the most powerful mobile file manager i have ever used and i have stopped using my previous favorite OI File Manager. this is do to the built in easy to setup (compared to other file mangers) windows file sharing for local files, and its FTP / SFTP file access built in) it even includes a media player for remote files and a download function for regular downloads and if that's not enough it also functions as a root file browser when you are rooted!  I seriously can not say enough good things about this file manager.
B004021JAY|5|These shoes fit well and clean nicely. They are true to size and stay on. My daughter really likes wearing them to school.  They have done well for P.E. too.
B0006IIPIK|2|Some movies are dazzling in their originality and style, while others merely borrow from better films. Sadly, Sky Captain is the latter. While this film is luminously photographed, it doesn't contain one iota of originality in its threadbare script. Perhaps my sights were set to high, hoping for a loving tribute to films like Metropolis. But even if they were lower, I still might have balked to see a leather-uniformed, eye patch wearing Angelina Jolie giving orders to the \\"amphibious squad\\". Throughout this movie I was literally counting the films which it ripped off. I suppose they were somehow hoping if you put all the parts of successful movies together, you might end up with a winner yourself. Unfortunately all you end up with is a beautifully photographed mess.
B0001AP12G|5|i think this is one of the best albums i own its just so sick and i recomend everyone to get it.
B000002NG7|4|This album is worth purchasing for the song \\"Strip search\\" alone.  Mike Patton is amazing, as usual.  There are a few tracks I skip sometimes.
B00AGOGOLE|5|I love this app it's cheap and works ! It's really easy to use it never crashes I'm glad I bought this it's the best out of all  the other ones
B00CXLQG0M|4|Love it.  Own several for me, the wife and the daughter.  Lots of fun.  For girls its great.  Has a shooting distance of 12'-15'.  At that distance still has enough impact strength to knock over cans and other objects.  Great for close quarter engagements.
B00AMBM9MO|1|I was expecting low brow humor. I got the low brow, just not the humor. I love a good blue comedy. This is not it.
B00C061HZY|5|Had never heard of these guys until someone at the office mentioned them and I found on vinyl.  Maybe the best thing I've heard (new) in a year or two.  Production is awesome.  Unbelievable in its uniqueness.  Beats slam the heart and the dynamic range isn't as limited as many albums today.<br />Recommended to just about everybody.
B00170GXYO|4|Who you gonna call? And yes, it's true, this man has no dick.
B001HN69B8|4|The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a really good movie if you haven't seen it.  It's a shame Heath Ledger passed away before finishing the movie, but the way they finished this movie was done incredibly well.  I have watched this movie several times and enjoy it more each time I watch it.  I would recommend this movie to pretty much everybody except people who get confused easy.
1936608898|5|Just finished day 30 of my whole30 diet and never felt better. I had been vegetarian for 5 years and thought i felt great, until now. Ive read so many diet books and different eating styles and none of them ever stuck or worked for me as much as whole30! It starts with food has given me a whole new outlook on the way i eat and what i am putting into my body. it stars with food was a huge part of my whole30 success. I previously tried to do the whole30 only by using the resources online but found this book to help even more! The book is packed with useful information and is extremely informative. It really helps you understand why you should be eating the way the book outlines!  I no longer crave sweets or carbs (which I never thought was possible)! My energy levels have Sky rocketed and i no longer feel tired throughout the day. i sleep better, my skin is clearer, and ive lost some of the Fat off my body! I've tried so many new combinations with foods and have been pleasantly surprised. Zucchini noodles is a great substitute for pasta and I never thought meat would taste so good to me again! I will say the 30 day challenge takes commitment! You have to plan ahead almost all your meals and you definitely spend a lot more time cooking in the kitchen! I did the plan with my boyfriend so we motivated each other! Know that it is extremely difficult to go out to eat during the whole 30, but not impossible! we both plan on continuing our whole 30 for 15 more days to extend to a whole 45! After that myself and my boyfriend have decided to only eat paleo for the rest of our lives! This has been such a great change!  This definitely won't be my last whole30! Great read! Definitely works! Highly recommended!
B00ENYKBD0|5|The movie is wonderful, the Amazon download was very spotty and filled with lapses and pauses.
B008Y768XO|2|This is a slow moving drama about a great dog story that's true but originally happened in China.  It would have been more interesting if they had filmed it there--not sure why they chose Woonsocket, RI...I think the actor's talents could have been put to better use.
B00JKGYSAI|5|Been playing it everyday, can't get enough of Ed Sheeran, even an old codger like me at 62!
B00DCRE83S|5|This is a stellar album by Newsted that has crunchy, bluesy, metal riffs that Jason growls his way through.  His vocals are a nice antidote to Hetfield's and there is not a bad song on the album.  Occasionally there is a hint of \\"Justice\\" era Metallica. The most glaring example is on \\"Soldierhead\\" and other moments like on \\"Ampossible\\".  But the album really kicks into gear with songs like \\"As the Crow Flies\\" and \\"Kindevillusion\\".  I highly recommend this album.
B00FGEO9NE|5|Hands down the best show on TV.  Suspenseful, exciting, GREAT acting and writing. Can't wait for season 4!!
B00KA87GCW|5|This is a fun game to play.  It lets you plan and enjoy building things.
B000NY12LO|5|This is a great read, but it is a little intense because it deals with suicide.  Jodi Picoult makes you want to keep reading.
B0047Y0FGY|5|I was already a fan of Tina Fey before reading this book, but I admire her SO much more now.  The book is well written and an easy read.  If I had the time, I would have read it in one day it was that hard to put down.
B00GM7STPI|2|In terms of her jewelry and style it was five star all the way! Naomi Watts was convincing !! The story and plot really failed though because first off her children are not featured just in a distance which in reality her children were everything to her and to not include this in the movie is ridiculous! Second her marriage was the number one headline in the world not much interaction with Prince Charles or any Royals in the movie. Third her death rocked the universe and the accident is not even mentioned no funeral scenes nothing! After the movie you are given an image of a selfish woman who gets easily obsessed with men !! is this the super humanitarian that won over every bodies heart!! No I don't think so!! This does not do justice to the memory of this amazing woman and sadly it leaves us with a not so good image of her even though she was outstanding in real life!!
B0031KC8OC|4|Unlike Skins; he loved, she hated; we have no reference point for for the CA high school milieu but it seems to be CA and worlds away from our experiences of 50 - 60 years ago. Veronica is a very colorful character working hard with all her talents to deal with a mother that abandons her and her father and help keep the home together. She makes some money becoming the school private detective and this is the hook that holds the show together while her private life and her efforts to locate and get he mother home unfold. There is enough humor along the way to keep the mood from getting too gloomy.
B004UID2LC|5|This app is very useful for saving youtube videos on your kindle.  The main place I get my wi-fi from blocks youtube so I download the videos when I can and watch them were wick blocks it or if I don't have wifi
1476746583|5|Enjoyable beach read.  I flew through this book.  Highly recommend.
B005WBBYXO|1|I felt like I was reading a book for a 10 year old.  With a simple storyline, and bratty kid girl as the hero I could never warm up to it.  I kept waiting for this deep theme that I read about in reviews that would appeal to adults, but nothing seemed that deep to me.
030726999X|4|I liked the third book, but I did not like that the main character had a less active role in this one.  I also thought the first half was slow and the last half wrapped up too quickly.  It definitely appeared to be written for a sequel.  Unfortunately the author has passed away.
B00IU0M85C|1|The initial concept was interesting. That being assuming another identity. By the third episode where the main character was<br />attacked by a being from another world....having survived being stabbed in the torso with a large piece of iron...had to let it go.
1932907009|5|This book does a great job of breaking down the components of a great script. If you can read and follow the individual steps, you'll right a good story.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I love the characters, the story line, the era, the way they dress, just everything about it.  Superbly done! Waiting with great anticipation for the new season to begin!
B006ON41FC|5|its a fun game. I was addicted. this is a review. I like pie. I li lie gurggle. jiggle jiggle
B009SJ3GUK|4|Addicting and dark, there were so many different stories going on in different periods of time. In the end it all tied nicely together. I also liked how many of the characters from the first season returned in completely new roles.
B003ZHQVJ4|5|I am one of those who believes that rock & roll has long since passed it's zenith. At least 20 years have gone by. But every once in a while an album springs from the crypt to give me hope that the true genre will return. This is one of those moments. Yeah, I know it's Kid Rock and in many circles it's not cool to admit liking his music. That said, \\"Rock & Roll Jesus\\" continues to sell well. If there is any interest in a vintage sound, those who yearn for it should pick this up. I purchased it on vinyl but there was no bonus cuts associated with buying that way. There's not a bad cut on here. (I'm not one to review albums cut by cut.) I will say that even the overly ubiquitous Sheryl Crow back-up vocals are welcome here; on Collide. That same cut has Bob Seger on the ivories but to me knowing that adds nothing. But if Seger's style of rocking is pleasing to you this album will not disappoint.
B0045HCJ9E|5|Shared another Hitchcock classic with my son.  He has really enjoyed the high suspense, humor, twisting plots, and flawless performances of Cary Grant and his fellow cast members.
B003O86FMW|5|The book was just as exciting as the first one! I stayed up a couple nights just not wanting to put it down.
0143035711|5|I am a Vietnam vet. I've been trying to read everything I can about this subject.  It is an accurate portrayal of how it was
B00NFK0052|4|Their voices blend beautifully , we enjoyed  the album as much as the concert  we saw on cable.
B005544TRQ|5|If you enjoyed \\"White Collar\\" you will love \\"Suits\\". The show has more excitement and has a better background plot.
B00CHIMG6Y|2|I could not wait until this movie ended....about 70% of the movie is just crying and pain. Good cinematogaphy and underwater detail, but had I known the whole 2 hours was going to be this dismal I would have not paid money for it.
B00HDMMISA|5|Another excellent book by this talented author who presents true to life characters and real life situations.
B00005JMEW|4|Kill Bill rocks. QT's dark sense of humor kept me rolling on the floor and the cinematic displays are awe-inspiring. It works this way: if you like Quentin Terrantino, you'll like Kill Bill. If you don't, you won't.<br />I would recommend, regardless of my high opinion of this movie, that if you can hold out for the purchase, then do so. Since Kill Bill volumes one and two are actually one movie (not a movie and a sequel), I've a strong feeling that after volume 2 is released, you'll be able to purchase the whole movie as a set. So hang in there if you can - volume two ought to be out on DVD right quick.
B00AMBM9MO|2|Some friends told us they liked this movie.  It wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be.  Below average rental.
B003UESJH4|5|Great movie.
B003ZJ23XU|5|The first one is better, but this still very nice. Always good to see the SATC girls together
B000I8ES5C|5|Great classic flick
B006LSZECO|4|It was exciting until the end - but I felt disappointed because of the ending.  I did not think he would stay with Amy and I thought Amy would pay for all she did.  The writing was great - the ending was not!
B005LAJ1O0|2|Not what I had expected and too difficult to follow.  This was recommended by a friend and I am not happy that I wasted my purchase..  I will  not watch anymore after fewing the first two shows.  I like good suspenseful shows but this was too far out.  I should have known with the Horror in title however I have watched and enjoyed some horror shows,  just not this.
B00BWBHIUG|1|There are major connectivity issues and in game actions are not properly recorded. This actually turns a beautiful looking game into a worthless time sink
B004SYP5WC|4|I use software on my desktop, but this app helps me remember when to pay bills, or when to schedule them.
B000007UHK|5|If you like this (which I do), then you might also like &quot;Sonic Seasonings&quot; by Walter Carlos. But you'll have to look for it under &quot;Wendy Carlos&quot;!<br />Also try Phaedra, and Richochet.
B00BPDR3F6|5|I like reading on my Nextbook the Kindle books. Since we had a number of books around by Elizabeth Gilbert I thought I should read one. I'm sure glad I did.
0446310786|4|Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a timeless classic, the brightest, most realistic story of children growing up that could ever be told.  A rarety amongst literature, To Kill A Mockingbird develops charcters that we care for, and anger that we feel towards the way we, the American people, once were.  The book does drag a bit at some parts, mainly the beginning, but the overall concept and emotion that stays with the reader upon the conclusion of the novel, far overshadows any down point in the book.  We watch as both children and adults, grow through the pages, their knowledge, but most of all, their feelings towards Tom Robinson and his family; it transcends and develops into a love far untouched in any other novel of its kind.  To Kill A Mockingbird is a heartfelt book, which will be remembered for many years to come.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|It was very insightful and gave such a different meaning to the story... I can't wait to read and see more of the world through Christian's eyes😊👏🏽
0385342071|5|First let me start by saying I enjoy books where the main character is the narrator of the story.  To me it just makes the story that much more enjoyable. I couldn't put this book down.  Once I finished reading I was left feeling giddy and I had a smile on my face thinking of the characters and the ending. I immediately jumped on my facebook page and recommended this book to all of my friends.  I love the ease in which Sophie writes the story.  I also enjoyed the footnotes at the bottom of the pages.  I'm reading a new book and I find myself looking at the bottom for a footnote.  This is my new favorite book.  I just purchased Sophie's other book \\"Wedding Night\\".  This is my new favorite book.  I will be checking out all of Sophie Kinsella's books.  Great author - great book.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great show!! A little like game of thrones!! Just starting season 2!! So far so good!!!
B00JB3MVCW|3|Not bad, little slow, but entertaining.
B00E8KLWB4|3|Confused, but plugging along doing the same two levels over and over.
B00NWLIW0E|3|Pretty fun, lots of glitches.
B004SBS8LA|5|Nice enhancements to an awesome game.  improved graphics, sound and gameplay.  runs great on verizon HTC incredible. not sure why i need 25 words minimally to review this app - guess i need to go downgrade my rating for the amazon appstore.
B007N85POS|1|This ANGRY Application is not for children. Let them get angry at the world later in life…BUT, NOT as young children.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Take first rate actors, give them a excellent script and director and you have Downton Abbey. The scenery is a part of the becomes, with the Abbey itself, an indispensable part of the plot itself. Watch season 6  when it comes out in January 2016 or watch seasons 1 through 5 on Amazon.
B00ENYKLIK|5|Fabulous movie and story.
B002KSPKRS|4|I purchased the Ear Force X41 after doing a lot of research.  My research paid off.  I like the sound that comes out of these headphones, like other reviewers have mentioned there is a little hiss that can be heard at higher volume levels, but I really can't hear it at the volume level I use.  The sound quality is superb, I really like the surround sound when playing an FPS or watching a movie.  They seem a little tight on my head but I should get used to that after some regular use.  I have not experienced any of the popping noises that some complain about.  Being a wireless engineer, my suggestion for those that have the popping issues is; Move your x41 base station and headphones as far away from any 2.4GHz wireless devices as possible, the greater the distance the better.  Also, if your access point supports lowering the transmit power, try doing that if you don't need the maximum possible range.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase and recommend it to others looking for a good gaming headset.
0553275569|5|For a very long time &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; was my favorite book (excluding the Bible, which is unique).  Even after reading Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; I'm not sure Wolfe's book has been dislodged from its position.<br />Wolfe begins to work his literary magic on the first page.  A young, beautiful woman is worried about her husband, a Navy test pilot, having heard that there has been a plane crash.  Space buffs like me reading the book are fascinated to realize that the woman is Jane Conrad, wife of Pete Conrad (which, incidentally, tells us that the bad news that day won't be about her husband).  If this scene appeared in a different book about the space program, even one as superb as Andrew Chaikin's &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; or Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger's &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; the account of events, while exciting and suspenseful, would remain on a somewhat mundane plane of everyday reality.  Wolfe's glittering, idiosyncratic literary style lifts events into a world of super-reality.  We experience Jane Conrad's concern and dread as if we were Jane Conrad.  Perhaps more than any other book I have read, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; has caused me to remember the events it relates as if I lived through them rather than reading about them.<br />One noteworthy feature of Wolfe's style in this book is his nearly Wagnerian use of verbal &quot;leitmotiven,&quot; key phrases which pop up over and over in the book and come to convey far more than the simple content of the words.  Anyone who has read the book will remember for a long time Wolfe's use of such phrases as &quot;bad streak,&quot; &quot;Flying and Drinking and Drinking and Driving,&quot; &quot;the Integral,&quot; &quot;our rockets always blow up,&quot; &quot;the Presbyterian Pilot,&quot; &quot;single combat warrior,&quot; &quot;ziggurat,&quot; and, of course, &quot;the right stuff.&quot;<br />The book also contains the funniest set-piece in any book I have ever read, the description of thecelebration when the astronauts and their families first visit Houston, including the fan dance by the ancient Sally Rand.  Interestingly, in the excellent film version of the book this scene was transformed from a hilarious comedy sequence into something elegiac, intercut with the sequence of Chuck Yeager bailing out of a plane (which happened on a different day in reality and in the book) to create drama and suspense.  In this radically different form the two sequences are just as effective in the movie as they are in the book.<br />&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being overly fictionalized, or at least speculative.  These criticisms probably have a great deal of validity, but they do not alter the fact that &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is the definitive evocation of that brief era around 1960 when almost anything, good or bad, seemed possible.  It is an unforgettable literary achievement.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love the show, but very disappointed that Matthew is killed off.  Broke my heart.  Love him and Mary together.
B0000TLA9G|4|Can anyone tell me, is the disc scratched on the top side on purpose?, is that the artwork?, well if it is, it sucks, and also the digipak case.<BR>the music is OK you get their hits not the fan favorites, only &quot;stranged&quot; missing. 4 stars for the music, 0 stars for the artwork.
0812983459|4|It's an amazing book. Starts off slow.  I was wondering why I was reading it.  But by the end,  it's a lovely book.
B00005U8EM|5|This movie is that rare Hollywood production, a fine work of art.  Ostensibly an ordinary comedy with a fantastical angle, the film is actually a felicitous combination of morality play and comedy.  And it accomplishes that delicate balancing act between humor and pathos.  It's laugh-out-loud funny.  Besides, the technical mastery of continuity and timing that keeps the viewer interested through the obligatory repetition required for the theme of a man caught in a time loop, the story examines the ways and means we can play out our lives.  Given enough time and trouble, we can choose one or a succession of methods with which to deal with such a predicament: disbelief, panic, realization, despair, opportunism, futility, self-awareness, and growth.  The hero passes through all of these.  The movie is a profound lesson on life without a sermon, with wit and humor, with only glimpses of melodrama, and most of all with the gift of hope.  Despite the misery of this world, with a constant and continual effort to improve we can find the secret of existence, meaningful love, and the truth about ourselves.  Unappreciated after its release, later seen as a sleeper, this minor masterpiece will in time become more widely appreciated and eventually an esteemed treasure.
B00GMFYX0A|5|Good product, as expected.
B0063GORYU|5|Love this! Lots of options for play and looks great too!<br />The nicest version I have ever played and you can't beat Free!
B0091QS88K|3|Fun! Good way to pass time..exciting ans addictive ..plz download.and you will not regret it..wish there was more games like this
B00159UUZA|5|The book was in a great condition, and my kids (even hubby) love reading these books!
B000002B7M|5|It is a very good album. He showed alot of emotions in this album but in all of his other albums as well. It seems that in all his albums he  sang about his life. Like in &quot;Suicide Solution&quot; it  talks about drinking and how it will kill ya, but he had a close friend that died because he drank alot.
B007J4T2G8|3|Ordered and received fairly quickly without issue. Item as described.  It is an okay book. Thanks very much. Would recommend.
B0057VDGNK|5|Drive's soundtrack makes this film so distinctive, or at least how the soundtrack mergers with what is happening with the moving image. The distinctive soundtrack can be labelled as ethereal electronic-pop. However, the depiction that straightaway comes to most people's minds is eighties-style synthesiser. Of particular import is unavoidable '80s/out-of-time melody of a song called 'A Real Hero' by the band called College.<br /><br />This an excellent OST worthy of anyone's music collection, not how small you're musical tastes maybe.
B00000K0DT|5|Believe it or not, Usual Suspects was actually somewhat of a sleeper when it first came out in 1995...but no longer.  Suspects combines a great cast, an intricate story (don't find too many of those these days), and  outstanding directing.  <br />What was likely the breakout role for Kevin  Spacey is quickly becoming a cult film noir worthy of quality DVD  collections and has even reached the level of being consistently quoted by  fraternity boys... &quot;Give me the keys ...&quot;<br />Joining Spacey is  Stephen Baldwin (one of those Baldwins) which turns in a solid performance  as a slightly nuts, yet cool under pressure, McManus (also check him out in  Threesome); Chazz Palminteri (Analyze This, Bullets over Broadway) plays a  tough acting fed who gets played like violin; Benicio Del Toro who does a  great job with smooth Fenster. I'll stop here, but the whole cast is  great.<br />The beauty of this movie is how the story develops and leads your  little brain into believing the events, names and characters that populate  it.  And when the puzzle finally seems to come together and you think you  are so cool for having \\"known it all along\\" and satisfied to have watched a  great movie, director Bryan Singer and writer Chris McQuarrie tear the  puzzle apart like your mean older brother would do only to leave you with a  thousand pieces that could come together in a completely other way.   <br />Watch Suspects over and over again and discover the subtleties and clues  that are sprinkled around the film.  You'll be continually amazed and  entertained.
B000001DYY|5|I had always been a fan of TFF's album &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;. For some reason I had walked by Elemental for years without much thought of buying it. I finally bought it about two years ago, and it blew me away. This is song writing and composing at it's finest. This CD will get under your skin and stay there. Ever experience music that made you feel that tingle deep down? Something that just makes you feel good? Works it's way up and makes you smile? If you haven't yet, this<br />should.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|It's fun and addictive. I love playing. The timed one's are a little more challenging for me. I love playing it. Keep up the good games
B000ECX0QU|5|Mystery, suspense and murder follow the defection of a top soviet spy.<br /><br />The story concerns itself with the Cuban Missile Crises (circa 1962) and French intelligence's intervention in Cuba with respect to American interests.<br /><br />A French intelligence officer's wife is having an affair with a man, codename \\"Topaz\\", and the point is made that all wives always talk \\"shop\\" concerning the work of their spy spouses. Thus, \\"Topaz\\" knows everything;<br /><br />The husband, a French intelligence officer, is having an affair with the beautiful head of a subversive underground group in Havana.  Before starting this movement, she played an important role in the seating of Fidel Castro, as Batista was fleeing. The national respect earned by her work provided a position of influence, but since that time, she has observed that the Castro government is not the government she wanted, so creates a new underground movement for personally satisfaction.<br /><br />This is a quiet, subtle Hitchcock film without major film stars; that is, stars recognizable to American audiences. But it definitely is Hitchcock, from a book by Leon Uris.<br /><br />While searching \\"Topaz\\" for Hitchcock's cameo appearance, remember he can be seen behind every camera.
B00B2V66VS|5|Love it! Get this if you do not have it!<br />U will enjoy it for as long as u have it.
B000SEIK2S|1|More and more writers these days are overly fond of exposition.  This book is no exception.  If we're not reading droll dialogue, we are reading lectures on this race or that race.  It seems the concept of &#34;show don't tell&#34; is lost on many writers these days.<br /><br />This book is, in short, a series of shallow conversations sandwiched between pages of exposition and intensely lifeless action and death.  When a friend dies, we get a lecture of how it happened, with the emotional depth of someone making an offhand comment about the weather in a feeble attempt at small talk.  No one is sad or upset.  No one experiences any emotion at all, except that of lust, and even that is written with an exceptional lack of passion.<br /><br />The characters have no depth or character or emotional states.  This fiction is purely juvenile male fantasy junk.  There is little of value in it besides the interesting idea of receiving new bodies.  The best part of the book is the opening line, which promises so much great writing to come.  Alas, the book spirals very quickly into tedium.
B00J8CGU64|1|This was one of the worst movies I've seen in 10 years. Can not believe it was nominated for so many academy awards. Great actors great director but this movie was very annoying to watch. Three hours long filled with drugs and sex and out of control behavior with lots of yelling. very disappointed
B00DP3IGJ6|4|I just bought the film on Vudu for instant streaming and my final thoughts of the film is that it is much better then what critics say about the movie.. It had a decent plot that was exciting enough and the action scenes were paced and pretty good in my opinion. This movie won't win Best picture but is good entertainment.
B00DR0PDNE|4|useless
B006MW3UZW|5|Very Good, my husband and I actually cannot wait to watch our episodes in the evening. Very well done and interesting !!!!
B008JFUS8M|5|Great job matching the book. Casting was fantastic, and they have their work cut out to replace Hoffman. Can't wait for Mockingjay.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great graphics and really fun. Reminds me a little of prof Layton but more about finding objects. Very good. Drives the kids and too.
0790729687|5|Arising from the depths of Anne Rice's mind, the vampires have come forth, both elegant &amp; savage, cultured &amp; barbaric. Ms. Rice adds a lot more to vampire legendry than do many of the gothic novels of contemporary times. We are taken back in time with a mind that seems to have actually been there. All the characters are given such life &amp; personality, that the story gives the impression that it could actually be feasble. There is a mysticism here, a deep fascination for the fantasy, that gives it a life all its own.<br />The brilliance of a truly vampiric talent, resurrects the folklore into a way of existance. Many of they who feel they are born too late in this dull age of mass-consumerism. Finally, we elect are experiencing a menagerie of gothic masterpieces remade to please, &amp; inspire one to dig up the original classics from their cobwebbed &amp; dusty shelves of libraries &amp; parlours.<br />The movie is very accurate to the book, the characters dramatically animate on screen, more than enough to delight audiences, impress the fantoms, &amp; even sufficiently please the authoress, &amp; it is quite rare to please an author, unless the production is pretty much identical to the original. The movie was not terribly &quot;hollywood-ized&quot; as some other vamp films were. The book &amp; the genre's integrity is kept intact. The world portrayed therin seems to come alive from within, a part of one's soul projected onto the screen.<br />Tom Cruise makes for an excellent Lestat {who would have known?}, &amp; the others do not dissapoint either. Sure, there really is no substitute for curling up on a dark &amp; stormy night, with candlelight illuminating a good horror novel, but I think it is finally time to intigrate such marvellous movies by the darkness of a black candle's flicker. For many of us, it has already been long as such.<br />Interview With The Vampire is top quality entertainment for vapire lovers. It contains much emotional/situational relativity to those living in morbid perspective. It is a pleaser. Romantic &amp; enthralling. We, as Gods, will be able to relate a lot of the philosophical aspects spoken in moments of vampiric revelation. Simply put, Interview With The Vampire is fangtastic.nal relativity to those living in morbid perspective. It is a pleaser. Romantic &amp; enthralling.

B007ZBWJXI|5|Quite refreshing to see that Asia is still Asia, unlike some other bands that not only have at most one or two original members but strain to try and sound like the original.  That's not the case with this album.  If you liked Asia 20 years ago you should like this album as well.  Very little if any drop off in creativity.

B001JNNDEW|5|I purchased this through Prime as an extra Christmas gift for the household. We haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I've seen the movie before. It's one of the best movies ever, and I won't even say what I paid for it on here because I don't know what they're asking for it now. I just know that I got an exceptional deal, I think it was a gold box or something. I'm looking forward to watching this version to see what the special flair is all about, but I did get a great price on this, shipping was fast through prime and I'm happy with my purchase.
B000004CYT|4|I have been familiar with Hogwood's Beethoven cycle since the 80's when I purchased several of the single disc releases. Now that I have the complete set, it has been wonderful listening to the symphonies in sequence. This set has many virtues. The tempi all seem right, there is plenty of forward momentum without ever sounding rushed or breathless. There is great definition and inner detail. The winds cherp and warble while the brass bray. After all, contemporary critics accused Beethoven of bringing the marching band into the concert hall. That sound is very much in evidence in these performances. Symphonies 1-2 are very good, 3-6 are excellant, although 7-8 are not quite up to the standard of the earlier performances, are still enjoyable. The 9th is also a most excellant performance. These performances illuminated the joy inherent in these symphonies. One minor caveat, the maniacal side of Beethoven is some what under played. The fate motive in the 5th does not really sound threatening as it has no time to linger. That being said, this is a most enjoyable Beethoven cycle to add to my Karajan '62 and Szell. Gardiner's Beethoven may have all the hype, but Hogwood's tempi, inner detail, recorded sound and balance truly bring out the &quot;revolutionary&quot; aspects of these great works.

030745455X|5|In lieu of so many reviews, I'll keep the synopsis of _The Girl Who Played With Fire_ short.  Picking up a year (or so) after _The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_, Blomkvist is dealing with the celebrity from his work with the Wenenrstrom affair, and Millenium financially is doing well, planning an issue (concurrent with the publication of a book) about the seedy world of prostitution, sex trafficing and what amounts to \\"white slavery\\" - young girls (early teens) brought to Sweden to serve as prostitues.  The writers of the story are murdered, dragging Blomkvist and Salander into the mystery of who did the crime and why.<br /><br />_The Girl Who Played With Fire_ moves at a much faster pace than _Dragon Tattoo_, which was a relief.  That readers are given additional background into Salander's past - specifically why she was institutionalized and what \\"All the Evil\\" was that contributed to Salander being the intorvert she is, especially held my interest.  Apparently some did not care for the way in which Larsson showed events from the perspective of various characters - essentially \\"rewinding\\" the scene to provide another angle of the story.  I didn't mind the literary device, and in fact thought it provided addtional insight into the characters.<br /><br />I was bothered, however, by the intentional witholding of information regarding signficant plot points.  For example, Salander meets with the murder victims before they are found, leaving readers to suspect (perhaps) Salander is guilty of the crime, as the story does not provide any details of what she was doing there.  I understand that this was done to \\"build suspense\\" (and perhaps to put readers in the shoes of Blomkvist and others investigating the crime), but I found it trite.  This reservation aside, I really enjoyed the story and \\"getting to know\\" Salander better.<br /><br />As with so many book in a series, if you enjoyed _Dragon Tattoo_, you will absolutely love _Played With Fire_.  If you struggled with the pacing of the first, I would recommend this installment of the trilogy, as the \\"first act\\" (so to speak) is much more brief (the assumption being, I suppose, that we already are familiar with the protagonists).  If, on the other hand, you were among those who were bewildered at the buzz around Larsson's books, don't bother - there is nothing new here that would dissuade you otherwise.would recommend this installment of the trilogy, as the \\"first act\\" (so to speak) is much more brief (the assumption being, I suppose, that we already are familiar with the protagonists).

B000002I99|5|I don't mean that every song on the album is over the top. What I mean is that they just don't make albums like this anymore(whether you like the songs or not). With the disbandment of the \\"Alice Cooper Group\\" Alice was able to take thing in his own hands. He co-writes every song, with the help of Dick Wagner and Bob Ezrin among others and created some timeless classics.<BR> Everybody has heard or heard of \\"Only Women Bleed\\" which was Alice's first balled and unlike anything he had ever done before. Alice would have better balleds in the future, but not with more powerful lyrics.<BR>\\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" A mixture of rock and jazz. A good track to start an album that takes you on a journey such as this one .<BR>\\"Department of Youth\\" Very similar to his other teen anthems. A bit different from the rest of the album. The guitar brakes are cool. The ending lines are neat too.<BR>The following are some other gems that are not as praised as they should be.<BR>\\"Some Folks\\" If someone can explain this song I whould be grateful, although not knowing makes more interesting.<BR>\\"Steven\\" Alice shows off his vocal range on this one. Quite a creepy song. It's not the lyrics really but the piano that makes it like that. The music at the end is outstanding.<BR>As stated earlier thay just don't make albums like this anymore. Not there is not good music out there, it's just not the like this.
B002WY65W4|5|I think this movie is great from beginning to end. Sure there are some predictable parts, some corny parts, but it's a comedy about zombies. I don't know how many times I've watched it, but just writing the review makes me want to watch it again.<br /><br />And in all seriousness, I've learned quite a few tips on how to survive once zombies attack. Between this and playing Left 4 Dead, I'm set.

B0043ISH6O|4|I love that The Social Network's soundtrack is composed by Trent Reznor.  It lends yet another reason to see this movie, and if you were on the fence before then this soundtrack might push you over the edge.  Listening to the 19 atmospheric tracks on this album make you wonder how they'll figure in to this Facebook movie.  Kudos to Reznor for proving once again that he is one of the most talented musicians out there.  With help from Atticus Ross, he's crafted a fine film score.  Of course, with any soundtrack of this nature, not everyone's gonna get into it.  This is all instrumental and abstract...not something you can just pick up and listen to.  Fans of Nine Inch Nails' equally haunting instrumental Ghosts I-IV album will definitely appreciate The Social Network's score, as this is essentially a \\"Ghosts V\\".  Unlike the Ghosts album though, this soundtrack has a bit more flair and melody to it.  If you're in the mood for something like this though, you'll find plenty to be mesmerized with!  This goes double if you're listening through headphones.  The soundscapes are just filled with little nuances that swirl around your head as you listen.  And in true Reznor fashion, when it comes to the sonic experience, everything is perfectly balanced.  All this adds up to an expertly crafted album.  Definitely worth checking out!

B00ILHW6AG|5|Yet another mind bending story.  I can never get enough of Mr King's charming characters, unrelenting wit and easy prose.  I loved the protagonist in the story and loved the first person account of a life lived with hope under the most surmounting of circumstances.  As always, King brings to life into perspective in the strangest of ways.  Don't we all live with guilt?  Don't we all wonder what lies beyond this life which can be so burdensome at times?  Isn't it hope that gets us through?<br /><br />I loved this book..........it gave me the creeps, it gave me goosebumps, it made me laugh out loud and gave me yet another glimpse into the complexities of lives not so unlike people we could all know.  His books always endear you<br />to life in the strangest ways.

B000002UA9|4|The Beatles, as everyone knows, evolved greatly during their run.  Their reasons for playing changed as well.  As a club band, they were mainly interested in making people get up and dance, so their music had to be highly exciting and almost electrically charged.  Later, when their live-playing days were over, they were more interested in making different kinds of music that wouldn't carry over easily to live performances.  So here we are with their first album, and it is coming from the Beatles as they were when they were a club band.  When you realize that the stuff on this album was recorded as it was played, with no studio trickery, you realize two things: 1) that the Beatles were really good musicians, and 2)just how much sheer fun a live Beatles show must have been in those early days.  These guys were obviously very, very good at what they did, which was get a club full of semi-drunk people excited over their music.  Alright, it isn't as artful as their later stuff, but you can't compare the two extremes.  This album, this music, stands on its own.  The word \\"fun\\" is used often in the reviews of this CD, and that is a great word for it.  Buy this one, put it in the stereo, crank it up, and get ready for some real fun made by a band that knew how to rock the room!

B00BCOGM78|5|This is one of their best albums yet, my other favorites are From beale street to oblivion and blast tyrant if that gives you an idea of the type of music i like. Earth Rocker gives a good tribute to the bluesy feel we love from Clutch, while keeping the hard rock we always want. All throughout the album you will hear up beat jams with exception to Gone Cold. 5/5 would recommend to any Clutch fan.

0440180295|5|This `anti-war book,' as Vonnegut himself has called it, focuses on the life of a World War II prisoner of war named Billy Pilgrim.  Pilgrim (along with Vonnegut, the narrator) was present when Dresden was bombed and destroyed by the Allied forces, killing far more people than the atomic bombs in Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  The bombing, and the ensuing ruinous carnage of the former city, serve to show the horrors of war, and the violence and destruction of innocent lives which are sometimes a price of the bloody game of war.<BR> <BR>But this is not your typical anti-war book.  Vonnegut does not openly criticize the Allies for bombing Dresden--in fact, one of his characters points out that, at the time, it seemed like it had to be done.  Another, more subtle consequence of war is the focus of this book, however, and this consequence is exemplified in the mental state of Billy Pilgrim.  Billy thinks he has stepped outside of time, and no longer sees things chronologically.  Instead, the novel constantly jumps back and forth in time to different events in Billy's life, including a supposed alien kidnapping.  Though the book treats these time jumps as real, enough hints are given for the skeptical reader to doubt.  The war left Billy's life in shambles, and he spends the bulk of the novel trying to make sense of it all (hence the non-linear narrative).<BR> <BR>Vonnegut seems to be showing us two ugly sides to war.  The first is the side we all know by now--the innocent victims, the meaningless slaughter, the terrible destruction.  But the second, subtler side can only be seen in Billy Pilgrim's character, and it seems this is another horrible effect of war.  War causes carnage and bloodshed while it is occurring, but it also has long term effects.  Depression, anxiety, and many other forms of mental illness can come about because of war, as Vonnegut so eloquently points out in this novel.  This is considered to be one of the greatest modernist novels of the 20th century, and with good reason.  I highly recommend this unique take on war.

B00005JLD4|4|In this courageous story, a 14 year old girl named Molly perseveres through nearly unthinkable hardships as she is literally ripped from her mother's arms and moved 1,200 miles away to an indoctrination center masquerading as a school.  Along with her eight year old sister and ten year old cousin they break free of the cages, both figurative and literal, to embark on an arduous journey back to family, back to home.  Because of a eugenics based government policy in Australia, all half-caste Aboriginal children were to be taken from their parents and sent to schools.  For nearly 70 years this policy attempted to educated and breed out the blackness of half-castes.<br /><br />Based on a book written by the actual daughter of Molly, this film is primarily about the three month struggle endured by the trio of little girls as they followed a rabbit-proof fence home through the sometimes very unforgiving outback landscape.  Along the way they bond, survive, and avoid the various efforts of the \\"Chief Protector of the Aborigines,\\" A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branaugh), and the tracker who is always one step behind the ingenious little girls.<br /><br />All of the leads were wonderfully real, and had the filming been done differently I could have been convinced that this was a documentary instead of a film.  Those playing Aborigine roles displayed a wide range of emotions, and truly appeared affected by all that transpired.  Branaugh, on the other hand, acted with the quiet reserve of a man who is powerful without being overbearing, a man who believes in the misguided policies of previous generations.  The pacing and directing is purposeful; it's slow, deliberate, and effective.  At no time does tedium become an issue, despite the lack of action.  Attention is demanded by the story's power and historical relevancy.<br /><br />This story and movie would be a wonderful supplement to any history teacher's curriculum, and it should be mandatory viewing for Australian students.  If I had to compare the power of this movie, my immediate thoughts are of [[ASIN:0790740850 The Power of One]].  For a movie with a clearly limited budget and a very basic, albeit beautiful presentation of the Australian countryside, I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />Jason Elinof this movie, my immediate thoughts are of [[ASIN:0790740850 The Power of One]].

Balance is a rocking cd that I personally enjoy every track on it. To date this is only 1 of 2 cds that I can pop in and listen from the beggining track to the end track and love all the songs. Some of VH's most iconic Hagar era songs are found on this cd but the only one missing is \\"Right Now\\", to get that song you need to pick up For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge or Best of: Volume 1. Do not be swayed by reviewers who can only accept one singer and view any change as trash...this cd is awesome and you won't regret picking it up.

B005HV6Y5W|1|This has got to be one of the worst movies out there ranking right along, but actually now replacing, The Fountain for first position. This movie is just bizarre.  Within the first half hour there is literally no story, no dialog and no point.  It is just visually someone's idea of... well... who knows what?<br /><br />*Possible Spoilers may be unintentionally mentioned* The most the movie has shown during this short time-frame is explosions in outer space and visually stunning filmography of different chemical style reactions.  Lots of flashing lights and flashes of different landscapes appear before you on the big screen.  Its all constantly changing. The point of the movie is lost among all of the different sequences.  It appears that the director/writer was on drugs.  Jelly fish sloshing around on the screen? Peaceful music?  You could almost mistake this for a peaceful meditation/sleep inducing movie if it weren't for the opera music laced between it all.  Then a dinosaur appears and runs around until he finds another dinosaur.  This new dinosaur is laying on the ground and the first dinosaur walks over and steps on the head of the dinosaur who is lying down.  What is the meaning of this? Very weird. Ah except it is a precursor to how the father treats his children and a child treats his brother.<br /><br />Yes, Brad Pitt and Sean Penn are in the movie, Pitt for about twenty minutes combined total, saying roughly ten or twenty sentences.  Penn has an even smaller part with roughly five minutes total and one or two sentences.<br /><br />This movie was filmed in such a way that it appears as a home video- filmed by a child, at a child's height and extremely close up.  The father is routinely depicted as an abusive, hard-nosed man who places odd demands upon his young children.  Pulling perfectly good green grass out of the yard....By hand....By his child. It appears he has a mental illness of some sort, OCD or maybe just a control freak?  He oddly obsesses over music and freely hands out tidbits of useless information to his kids throughout the movie.  He puts down his children constantly, and the children clearly cannot stand their father.  He is physically abusive to his wife and children.  A child dies.  A woman kisses a child wrapped in a tight white sheet. The whole body from head to toe is wrapped in this white sheet.  The same woman is shown floating around above the grass.  Its eerie.  A second child dies. A child grows up cruel, abusive and acting strangely just like his father. A child tells his father that his father would probably like to kill him when, the reality is, the child would actually like to kill his father. He prays that God will take his father away.  The movie continues as we follow two brothers living life with their family.  The older brother tormenting the younger brother in various different and demented ways.<br /><br />This is just a really odd movie that only a certain group will like.  This is going to be one of those movies that you either love or hate. I don't see how it could be middle of the road at all. And while \\"Dove\\" has given it the green light and approved it appropriate for kids 12+, they would be extremely bored and confused.  At over two hours its a bit much.  I am amazed by the people who can see/read deeper into the meaning of these two movies. Or maybe they are just seeing what they want to see?

B008RTE09S|3|We waited years in the U.S.A. for \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" to be released and eventually it did see the light of day on cable TV and video release decades too late.  The main saving grace is the music itself, some of the Beatles finest to be sure.  However the film itself was a disappointment to me.  In the \\"spirit\\" of the times it had a very loosely defined point which is to say there isn't much of a plot.  But most die hard Beatles fans will want this in their collection of course and now we have it on Blu-ray.  I'm writing this just to alert potential buyers that it may be wise to shop around for a better price.  At this date, Thanksgiving eve 2012, I've seen it at Target for their everyday price of $19.99 for the Blu-ray edition.  They did not carry the deluxe version or at least I didn't see it.  I would guess that other retailers have about that price, as Target tends to price according to local market competition (Wal-Mart, Best Buy, etc.).  For such a less than best film it's probably worth finding a lower price but I wouldn't wait too long as this may be one of those items that becomes rare down the road.  Anyone want a Beatles \\"Anthology\\" box set of VHS tapes?  Happy Holidays.

According to the terms of his father's will, he may choose not to open it but &quot;should he decide to open the envelope, it must be on the condition that he will never divulge its contents to any other living person.&quot; Adam realizes that the envelope must contain the secret that led his WWII hero father into public disgrace and dishonor.<br />He opens the envelope and begins to unravel its secrets. Suddenly he's being pursued by the KGB. The defense strategy of the USA is in danger of becoming a pawn to Russia's plan to take over. An imaginative story, building suspense, surprising plot twists and lively writing make this a page-turner. If you like John Le Carre and Robert Ludlum's books, you should love this one.<br />Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)
B00L9B7IKE|5|Intriguing plot.
B000VDUWMC|2|&#34;Some images not available...&#34; means no figures in kindle book.  Not a complaint about book, but lousy kindle policy.  Should say &#34;Figures necessary for full understanding are not in included?&#34;
B00AALHW6Y|5|Darius Rucker is a great singer/song writer, and my wife and I look forward to his next album. We are glad he went country.
B007FEFLTO|5|Excellent and historically correct. Great way to learn history,
B00DA6YEKS|4|Whelp, Sanderson did it again. Just like Way of Kings, this book is way too long, way too self-indulgent, way too slow for the first half, and way too full of on-the-nose characters spouting on-the-nose dialogue. The first two-thirds were a slog—to the point that I was feeling pretty disgusted and ready to say I was never reading another Sanderson book again.<br /><br />Ironically, this is pretty much how I felt about Way of Kings. It was “meh” up until climax—which totally blew my mind.<br /><br />I really didn’t think he’d be able to do that again.<br /><br />But you know what? He totally, totally did.<br /><br />Starting with Adolin’s big duel and then right on through the shockingly epic climax, this book went from bad to bravura in a heartbeat. If you would have told me I’d be saying this halfway through the book, I would have said you were crazy: But I’m totally reading the next one.<br /><br />So, in short: Sanderson drives me nuts. He is so very, very good at the things he’s good at—and so frustrating at just about everything else. But his virtues *are* amazing, and so I keep reading!
B001AP11L6|5|This is a great album. Yes, I have heard the songs on it many times before I bought it but... Great feed for my workouts.
B0097HSS4M|1|Waste of valuable memory on phone IMO
B0048LPRD2|4|*SOME MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*<br />This movie has a lot going for it. A great soundtrack, it's visually stunning, and it has a great concept. Be warned this movie will take you for a ride for better and for worse (this is sometimes filled with disturbing content). You experience the life, death, and journey toward reincarnation of the main character. You live, die, become a disembodied spirit (Bardo) and are reborn through his first person perspective. Some parts of these experiences may not be that good. This movie is an emotional rollercoaster. The main character is ammoral and you see how some of his life choices affect the ones he is close to. He is later reborn and who he is reborn as is pretty spectacular. In short, the viewer experiences one cycle of Samsara.<br /><br />Pros: great soundtrack, premise and visually stunning.<br />Cons: Not recommended for those with Photosensitive Epilepsy. Contains disturbing content. Has a melancholy and eerie tone.
B000FFJ85I|5|I bought this cd b/c i heard Miss Murder on TRL and i loved that song .. and i heard all the songs and i love it!!!! im a new AFI fan!!
B00EMXBDMA|4|The only reason I'm not giving this five starts was that the writing could have been a little better.  This book as a lot going for it.  It is really funny.  Also if you are a person who likes thinking about how stuff works, you will absolutely LOVE this book.
B00HV8T1WC|4|Very nicely done. You follow the main character along as he deals with each new calamity in a logical, methodical fashion, and identify with each action he takes as the film progresses. It's fascinating to see about how he deals with the new turns that affect his situation. And I loved the ending...
B00005JKC3|5|I just loved this movie. As always Ang Lee has interjected something of himself into his movie, which gives it a certain inexplicable quality that lifts if over every other SuperHero movie (with the exception of Unbreakable that is).<br />I loved the depth of the characters, I loved the CGI Hulk and I adored the scenes of mayhem and destruction. The only thing I didn't like is the ending, which I will not spoil. I thought the conclusion of the fight was a bit too simple.<br />People who think that Spiderman was a better (or even a good) movie, should have their heads examined. This is like comparing a good book to a Tom and Jerry cartoon.
B002MQYOFW|3|I can't believe this trilogy has me feeling so compelled to write my first ever Amazon review.  I'm not a review type of person.  However, I'd like to gently forewarn the next enthusiastic reader about The Hunger Games, Katniss and Suzanne Collins.  Because, I, for one was surely enthused.  Please know I really wanted to give the entire series a 5 star across the board.  I really did!!!  There was room for such great growth and potential.  Yet, I left the world of Panem feeling lukewarm, disturbed, and stunned.  Especially the ending to Book 1 and most definitely the last book, Book 3.    Suzanne is definitely not a happily ever after sort of author.  Which is fine - to each its own.  Now I know for future read.  With all the violence and darkness, I remained hopeful for a happy ending.  A ying/yang balance to all the ick.  I kept trudging along believing that hope will arrive, that I wouldn't be disappointed.  The time of hope never does arrive and I was disappointed.  It was more like a constant lingering tease.  Until you realize, \\"what have I done?\\" and go \\"DOH!\\"  O-M-G the characters are flat, 1 dimensional.  There was such richness for the main and secondary characters to be developed.  I was wishing for them to develop and grow.  Now onto the romance, first love, etc.  I'm saddened by the romance because you can't even truly call it one.  I'm a dubious sentimentalist and hopeless romantic.  It was just so unbelievable and annoying.  It felt like an afterthought, almost like let's toss the readers a mince bit of bone.  If there's a love triangle make it real and good - pump it with drama.  Instead Gale was missing for most of the entire series.  Katniss... oh Katniss!  I didn't like her and she's the heroine.  Like the series and my imaginings of 5 stars, I strived extra hard to like her.  In the end I found I wanted to slap her silly for being blind and entirely selfish.  Perhaps on the verge of wringing her neck.  You know shake her into realizing that lovedid surround her and to stop taking flight.  Even after the heroine realizes she was selfish, she didn't change.    Overall, I did enjoy my read of the series.  Therefore, can't will myself to give it less than 3 stars across the entire board.  I read all three books in 3.5 days.  I don't regret making my Kindle purchases or taking the time to read the trilogy.  I'm just sad that I wasn't able to find it amazing because I started so very hopeful/optimistic.  I'd even recommend others to give it a chance and see for themselves.  In this case I'm the minority (voice of the few who dare say otherwise), since so many people love the trilogy.  But in the end I wasn't impressed and it left a lingering bad after taste in my mind.    The only upside to this are the characters of Prim and Peeta (especially Peeta).  He was the redeeming quality and salvation to this messy atrocity.  If I can ask Suzanne, I'd like to know her decision of Finnick and Prim.  Than cry out, \\"why?\\"  How is this for YA?
B004XUMPFQ|5|Firefly is one of the few TV shows (and movie!) that I always keep coming back to. The characters are just so memorable, and the story very unique. While it is a Sci-fi show, the story behind River and Simon's escape, along with Mal's (the captain) military history gives this show a western, frontier settlement edge to it. The main characters aren't some badass all powerful supersoldiers set out to find or kill galactic aliens or robots, but are a simple ragtag group of people who have found each other and are just trying to scratch by a living with any job they can get. Some legal, others not so much. Give the show a shot, the first episode is set to introduce you to all of the characters and provide as much information as it can (hence its 1.5 hrs), but it's well worth it.<br /><br />Oh, and Fox, you guys suck for cancelling the show.<br /><br />I'll be in my bunk.
B007BVOEPI|5|love hating it
0061122416|5|Wonderful story for kids from 5 to 99.  Worth every penny. I bought it as a gift but my husband, ( the English major), wants to keep it for his library. funny. Will buy a few more copies for giving this Christmas.
B002KREVCO|5|I bought this for my husband for Christmas last year. He and I are both huge fans of AC/DC; he, however, collects everything to do with the band. So it was awesome to find something he didn't have! The CDs and DVD are both great and have some really obscure stuff.<br /><br />Great for any collection!
B00CXQL828|5|Just good old fashioned kick-ass Rock and Roll. It has that certain something that makes me unable to take it out of my cd player. I expected something good from these 3, but I did not expect what is bound to become a new classic.
B008JFUUQ2|5|This movie was way better than I expected. It was so funny. The family loves it! Happy to add to my collection....
B00DV2D0JC|5|Fun
B00JE5NR4I|5|Loved it
B008KRJWEK|5|The game is pretty good. It took me a while to find a good game and when this one showed up I downloaded it and assent board anymore.
B001ANYDAO|5|Outliers is very well put together.  Gladwell found many different examples to further his points and does a great job of tying them together.  I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B00J6K0XFM|4|Sebastian doesn't dissapoint in this Cd. His voice is still rock'n it! Although it's similarities are still the same as his past music I still enjoy his style.If you were saki's Row fan,  like myself then you'll love this Cd.
0553106635|5|I have been an ardent consumer of fantasy literature for 25 years or more and through those years I have reveled in the experience of a good read, a ripping good yarn, a can't put it down until it's finished experience. Until recently that is! The last few years that enjoyment has all too infrequent and much of what is out there is all too easy to put down. Jordan is the obvious if some what belaboured example. But in this desert of screaming mediocrity there are a few glints of hope, Goodkind for one, Farland is another and then theres George. One thing I learned on a recent historical tour of England was that there was very little that was noble about the nobility, rather it was a snakepit rife with greed and treachery and Song of ice and fire reflects this reality as well as anything I have ever read. The third in this series offers great twists and turns, betrayal, deception, murder, great battles, and enough surprises to keep even the most insightful reader guessing.<br />Unlike the ersatz, fuzzy, bland, &quot;everyone live happily ever after&quot;, pablum of the Eddings, A Song of Ice and Fire is the blueprint for future fantasy writers on how it should be done.
B0054JZC6E|4|eh.. its ok I guess... its definitely easy to kill time with it but its a good thing its free, cuz I wouldnt have spent money on it
0345803485|4|I thought this book was very well written, all three of them, I thought the writer did a very good job with Christian, I loved how they went from a man that was living in his own world and not really having and knowing a real relationship.... and then having a relationship that he loved and lived for.... with a touch of his \\"Oh so Christain ....his fifty shades\\".<br /><br />I thought that Ana was such fun in this book, I so loved her inner Goddess, which many times left a smile on my face, I also loved her spirit of who and what she was.... and always keeping Christain on his towes, and always reminding him..... of how far he has grown in life and in there relationship.<br /><br />The only thing that was disapointing to me was, that they wrote a pregnancy so early in the Trilogy.....the two main people in the books being Ana and Christain, are so big in all aspects of there lifes..... I hope that the writer will really focuse more on that in the next book, and that  Ana continueing driving him nuts with her crazy \\"in the moments\\" things she does.... and having a pregnancy just was not somthing I thought need to be put in the Trilogy right now. Other than that is was a very good book.....<br /><br />I am very excited to read the next book though, I just wish.... and one can only hope she will focuse more on them and there life, relationship,and all the crazy stuff that goes between them.
B0027MJU00|5|Five stars for this great read. Total who did this until the end of the book.  Love this writer, no disappointment here.
B00G3Q6VPS|5|LOVE THIS LADY!!!!
B00KIGRRRU|5|Great movie! If you like the X-men then you'll enjoy this movie..
0767849493|5|Dogma probably works on a higher level than any of Smith's films, and that's good. He had the whole vulgarity thing down pat with the brilliant Mallrats, but then, file this in &quot;oh how the might have fallen&quot; dept, he came out with Chasing Amy. Then this came out. It's great really. I don't see what all the hoopla was about. If you were to actually watch the film, you would see that it does not attack the church, but in effect actually educates us. Kevin Smith is a practicing Catholic, so I wouldn't see why he's bash his own religion. He just makes statements and opinions that we aren't used to. Within minutes, I was back in full KS mood as soon as we got to the first long monologue scene-with George Carlin introduing the Buddy Christ. Might offend few, but really I was like, &quot;yknow, I never though about that way.&quot; Those that are offended by killing angels should note that angels who turn away from God are demons! Now, does a shooting demon sound any worse? Stop slapping labels on these kinda things people. The film is very hilarious and action filled-if I were to make a film, it'd be something like this-smart, with action, but not overly contrived or unoriginal. There's so many memorable lines and scenes (in usual Bob glory, Bob uses mouth spray to kill a .... demon) that by the time the credits roll, you feel like you've been on a ride. Those who found the ending battle hokey, I say, &quot;ha! let me guess-you liked Gladiator?&quot; Dogma is a masterpiece.
B007PKOKTK|4|This was a fun movie, but the best part was renting through Amazon Instant video. My child was sick and it was great to be able to get her something new to watch while stuck in bed without leaving the house.
B00BEU19ZU|5|I love it. Being able to see how many other flights are arriving at the same time helps planning for going through immigration, picking up rental car, etc upon arrival.
B000BJS4SU|4|John Mayer exploded on the scene a couple years ago with acoustic driven pop songs like No Such Thing, which catapulted him to James Taylor of the 21st Century status and landing him in every co-ed's music collection.  Each song on Room for Squares was well crafted pop song but if you caught him in concerts or at the very least head his live album Any Given Thursday, he yearned for a little more than your garden variety TRL acts with more bluesy versions of songs and Dave Matthew Band type jams.  That transition continued with the more experimental Heavier Things that had a few straight up blues songs on it.  Mayer recently completed his transformation into a blues artist when he dumped his touring band and repackaged himself as the John Mayer Trio with Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Palladino on bass with the group channeled the power trios of the past such as Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. <br /> <br />The live album starts off with How Did You Think I Was with a riff so raw all the car companies are probably clambering as you read this to put it in their commercials even if it sound like a Lenny Kravitz riff, to be specific, Always on the Run.  The lyrics sound as if they were a retort to anyone who questioned Mayer's credibility, \\"Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?  Is he the one who turns the ladies on?\\"  But even with the power trio, Mayer can't seem to get away from his lovelorn lyrics that populate his previous albums like on Good Love Is on the Way.  And Mayer goes a little too far when he intros Out of Mind by joking the home of the blues is in Connecticut.  You can even hear his band roll their eyes when he says this. <br /> <br />No concert is complete without a cover song or two.  On Try the trio runs through the Hendrix gem Wait Till Tomorrow.  But the musicians truly gel for a funky version Ray Charles' I Got a Woman.  If you listen closely you can even hear Mayer emulate Kanye West's Gold Digger, which samples the Charles classic, with his guitar.  But when Mayer starts to sing, he ends up like sounding like he's imitating Jamie Foxx imitating Ray Charles.  The song was supposed to close out the show, but anyone who has ever been to a concert, there's going to be an encore where people cheer for one or no.  So after the prerequisite wait, Mayer and crew comes out and go through bluesier versions of song off of his last album, Daughters and Something's Missing, the later slips back to his teen idol self with the call and response with the \\"checks\\" at the end of the song.
B00DRPVE3M|4|This game is fun and the people who you actually play are great. Great for sitting in Dr offices waiting to be seen.
B00CEZJT2E|5|Awesome Product.  My brother purchased an E5 and I loved using it with him on trips.  The only issue is that it was too big for me to carry and I loved the slim form factor of this one.  I'm a heavy user of my HTC one and need a charge by the time lunch rolls around. This pack has more than enough power to last me throughout the day.  As a HUGE added bonus, it comes attached with a USB cord.
B0041KKYEW|1|I think this is one of the most stupid--if not THE most stupid--movies I have ever seen. I fell asleep twice, but since I rented it, thought I would watch it so that I could give an honest critique...and honestly, I am thankful I didn't waste my money at the theater. I should have paid attention to those here who felt the same as I about this stupid movie. It was a waste of time.
B00IIUATDM|4|Its a great move with great actors who really play their respective roles well. The only complaint i have is the length. Its almost 3 hours which is a little long for my taste.
B004FGMDOQ|5|I loved this story! The pictures were creepy enough to keep it interesting and the story was different than anything I've read. I can't wait to see the film adaptation of this.
B00BMKH5NW|3|Got this after reading - and loving - Eleanor and Park.  Liked it, didn't love it.  Cath is a whiner, Wren is a wreck, and I just couldn't really care about either of them, sadly, because I wanted to, Rowell's prose and voice got me close, and then Cath would complain again about something, and I'd be disappointed again.  Did I mention I loved Eleanor and Park?
B00FE5N09Y|5|I love this show and I love how they designed the box set, it's perfect!! I hope it comes out within the year.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Excellent!
B000HEWEJO|5|Of course it is GREAT! Though I was under the impression that this version was in color, it wasn't so I had to decline this purchase. I will be purchasing the DVD when it becomes available in COLOR!
B00IG2DOKM|4|great app and a great time waster as they say.  keeps you busy doing different things so you can get engrossed in it very quickly.  I had only one issue with the Tbucks not loading properly but it was quickly resolved after I contacted the apps creaters.  They were very nice and quickly credited my account with no questions asked.  highly reccomend downloading this game to anyone.
B00FVVR2ZO|5|Free game worth every penny.  Great way to kill time if you are mind-numbingly bored at a doctor's office or at work.
B00D6GT5S8|4|I love Sigur Ros. This album is darker than Takk. Still like it. It paints landscapes in my head.
B00AREIAI8|4|Such a great active game. I love all the design put into it, and the idea of it all surrounding horses. It's for people who like to do activities with horses and care for them in a virtual manner
B000QRIGLC|5|Amazing story of bravery by a fellow Texan
B00687Q0VC|4|Not much time is spent on John Adams in History Classes. He's mentioned as a small tempermental man who was president. Now, we have a chance to know more about him...and the time in hisotry when &#34;terrorists&#34; became leaders.
B00DUGCLY4|5|It's fun but I can't get past some
B00F35BV64|3|The special effects were good, and I love the cast, but there were too many plot holes left unfilled and too many points where some technological device or other would break just enough to allow for gratuitous hand-to-hand combat.
B008FRFN7A|4|can't get it to work
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is a match eye coordination game. Fun and addicting, music too keeps playing in my head.  Try to get friends on fb to get lives instead of spending $
B00TYB95I4|5|Great
B0051ANPZQ|5|This book touched my heart and made me realize how great my life is. I would recommend this book to anyone! It fits for all ages. I liked it because it didn't have any bad language like most books these days. If you love a good short read you have to read wonder.
B007SYWFRM|5|This is a really fun game. I've enjoyed it! It's one you can do a lot without having to do the in app purchasing
B00CU0UE0E|4|Some songs sounds a touch too compressed. Not sure if it's the mp3 sound or not.  Content wise this is a great album.  Worth getting. No disappointment here.
B009CPES4I|5|very enjoyable movie
B007EC27QM|5|Nice and big.
B00005JODK|1|Hairspray seemed to have been a West side story gone foolish.  Please, were there no white fat women available to act the part of the white fat mama?  Travolta was a Travesty as John turned Joan, goodness me is this what happens when actors go into menopause?  Leave this sort of thing to Eddie Murphy who has already perfected it.  Additionally, the big deal made over overweight people during the sixties is another nonsensical flim flam.  During the sixties people were not so weight conscious as they are now.  In fact skinny people were considered unattractive.  The Travesty and his big white behind dancing on stage on TV would have been so laughable it would not even be considered.  I am not going to spend any more time on this review, suffice it to say, I wasted my time going to the theatre.
B00P7PBD2C|5|1 word...Fantastic.
0061122416|5|The book tells a great story about a book going after his dreams and eventually becoming a success. Very Inspirational.
B000JQUKKU|5|I have always enjoyed Dickens and this one is one of his best.  A good read at Christmas season.  A short read and a good reminder of a timeless message.
B001DDBCUA|5|Good memories
B0094M2ITG|5|Great movie. It is fun and whimsical, but at the end it throws in some great emotion. I cry each time I watch it and am not ashamed.
B009ZAY8MM|5|My wife loves Christmas Music and I bought her this. She liked it and she's happy and that is what I wanted it to do.
0385536828|1|The book is dificult reading.  Very British so you really have to think a lot about what is being said.  Its written like a diary in terms we in the United States who are not from England are not readily familar.  I am into it about 50 pages and will finish it, but it is not fun nor very interesting.  So far all I see is a young woman, daughter of a Bishop who is enjoying numerous affairs but somehow is being recruited as an agent.  (I think)  Hopefully the story line gets better.  Wish I had not spent the money.
B008JFUPFI|1|I hate this movie. It's like picking up a Superman comic fresh from the store, and being forced to read Superman's beginnings all over again, with different artists & illustrations.<br />How much more is the typical home audience forced to endure another bit of Smallville & Clarks meeting of Lois Lane?<br />At least the George Reeves television series had a beginning and moved on to many adventures. Christopher Reeve tried, but was met with lame villains & situations. Brandon did fairly well, it showed promise, but Brandon bailed out. His bad. Kirk Alyn was before my time, but his serial still moved on in spite of amateur special effects. My suggestion to Hollywood is to read the Superman encylopedia, & gain some new insight as to Superman universe, a showdown between him & Bizarro would be most welcome. Anything but the continuation of Jor-El's plight at having to let go a son, and seeing so having to see him off into the new world.
B00006879E|5|Songs About Jane is certainly no plain Jane and it stands out among those mainstream pop albums you hear. As a whole, all the songs are really great and you get hooked to it after a few spins. It's true cos I have this personal experience. When I listened to the album for the first time, I found Adam (the lead vocalist of Maroon 5)'s vocal very special and just wanted to listen to it over and over again. It's rock music with a very gentle touch, and easy to listen to. It's really hard to pick out a few favourite songs out of the album cos every track is just so awesome. But, if I really had to choose, it'd be... <br /> <br />She Will Be Loved, Harder To Breathe, This Love, Sunday Morning. <br /> <br />This album is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to everybody reading this out there.  <br /> <br />
B00WP9HSJU|2|I am washy washy about this book. I wanted to love it but instead I kind of liked it.  It was light and silly bordering on ridiculous but it was also cute and occasionally funny.
B002MQYOFW|5|I heard a lot of people like the book so I disided to read it and than watch the movie
B00AEFXV3E|5|Excellent movie!!!!
6300216268|5|This movie always brings tears to my eyes but still makes me laugh. The treatment of suicide in this film is the best I've ever seen - touching, tragic, and still funny - so that you can see that all storms have a  rainbow after them. Definitely a must see, but you have to be in the right  mood. It is not all light, nor all dark.
1451695195|5|Brilliant read. Thought provoking.
B00CH26TL8|4|I found the game to be entertaining.  A great way to kill time.
B001HBYHFA|2|terrible in every way
0765348276|4|If you read this book, do yourself a favour and skip the first third of it. It's mindless filler setting up a concept that could be done in a page or two. Ten pages if you wanted to be verbose. It reads like a personal account of someone's first day at a retirement home. Seriously. It's that bad.<br /><br />Other then that, it's a fast-paced, interesting, intergalactic-war story. Not great writing, bad character development, but good for what it is.
B002VECM6S|5|wasen't able to see it in the movie, I just love Sandra bullock movies. I hope I will enjoy it.
0887431461|5|Great practice and learning material for children entering grade K. All my children used these types of workbooks at home during the summer, going to doctor's office, ect before entering the next grade, or as a rewiew from the previous year and it helps. It keeps them thinking and they love it.
B006BAEQB2|4|I cannot believe how intriguing these books are!  On to the next one and the next one. . .they go by so fast.
B0017ZB8M6|5|There are a lot of things that work here, unlike pop albums that are hodge-podges of hits and misses. Perry's unifying theme here is gender stereotypes. From 'One of The Boys' to 'I Kissed a Girl' to 'Ur So Gay' to 'Mannequin,' Perry satirizes popular conceptions of what it means to be female or male. Yet she sincerely paints a picture of loving and longing on other tracks on like 'Thinking of You,' 'Lost,' and 'I'm Still Breathing.' This album is very listenable, song-for-song, with lots of clever hooks. The production is solid, but Perry's capable voice is what really shines here. She is successful where the recent efforts of artists like Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, and Alanis Morrisette fall flat.
B005K0HDGE|5|Totally engaging.
B000002J23|4|This 1980 disc by the prog-rock veterans was the only release they recorded without vocalist Jon Anderson. But don't despair Trevor Horn (The Buggles) does an outstanding job filling Anderson shoes. This also is one of many recordings they did without keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman. He is replaced by Horn's bandmate in the Buggles and future Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes, who also does a commendable job.<BR>I think that the remaining Yes members without Anderson, decided that they could spread their wings and go for a harder sound and it's evident on Drama.<BR>Steve Howe's guitar playing is much more agressive as is bassist Chris Squires. It is some of their best work in Yes.<BR>I really liked the opening track &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; a three part, ten minute and half minute opus. I also liked &quot;Into the Lens&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;. <BR>It may have dissapointed the hard-core Yes fans but I liked it. Check it out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Love this game app! It was challenging and entertaining. Beautifully rendered art. I can't stress enough how cool this game/app is.
B002UM5BXW|5|GREAT book! For those in the kitchen, or on the other side of the doors. This book is so real.
B001NY4X46|5|Just a couple of clarification points for anyone thinking about purchasing.    Screen Aspect Ratio is NOT 2.35 as shown in the Amazon Product Details.    The Screen Aspect Ratio is 1.85 and is Anamorphic, NOT Letterbox as on the 10-21-1998 DVD release.    GREAT movie, one of my top 10 movies .... Glad I now have the WS (1.85:1) Anamorphic format.
B00O8NPCA8|3|I will tread very lightly to avoid spoilers which is extremely difficult in reviewing this particular feature.  Director of the Bourne Identity, Doug Liman, tries his hand at the Sci-Fi genre with this over ambitious version of Groundhog Day mixed with aliens made up of electrified bungee cords, geektatsticly militarized mech suits, and completely satisfying doses of Bill Paxton “douchbagginess”.  It is a unique and engaging tale that keeps the &#34;deja vu thing&#34; fresh and fluid avoiding any pitfalls of tenaciousness and predictability.  Cruise's comeback continues and this forte seems to fit him, his character is both genuine and convincing.  The supporting staff is, however, is just so/so, playing off cruise well enough but possessing so little depth and development they never really make that much-needed connection with the audience.  The special effects are incredible, amplifying the story rather than overshadowing it.  But the film fails on two levels, the poor character evolution being only the first and least.  It is a safe and nonsensical ending that utterly corrupts the film and leaves the audience, jaws agape, wondering why they just wasted two hours of their lives they will never be able to &#34;reset&#34;.  Even in the most outlandish concepts, some semblance of reality or believe-ability must exist, if not, even the indoctrinated and dedicated fan-boy will be left empty handed, and the mainstream totally lost in translation.  There were apparent script issues during production and it is apparent in this hastily crafted conclusion.  2 out of 5 Kernels; one of the greatest disappointments of 2014 that didn't have to be.
B0000027RL|5|While many fans of the newer, more &quot;toned-down&quot; and less  commercial Pearl Jam (I count myself one of these, btw) may decrie Ten as  simply mainstream, radio-friendly anthems for the masses, this album stands  undeniably as one of the best albums of the 90s. From Once and Evenflow to  the more laid-back (and still wonderful) Black, the album is absolutely  tremendous. The often-underrated second half of the album deserves credit  also in that it foreshadows the greater complexity found in PJ's later  records. Fans of Binaural &amp; No Code (again, I am one) may want to deny  it, but Ten is most likely what inspired them to follow the career of PJ  amd is truly one of the band's strongest albums.
B007EC27QM|4|This is not an overly complicated calculator.  I don't think you'll be using logarithms on this or doing calculus as it's just a four function calculator with a percent key thrown in, as well as memory.  It's a good size and easy to read, plus you can go to the actual calculation to insure you entered the numbers correctly.
B00IYOACQ6|5|My 9-yr old son and I have loved the Can You Escape games since we discovered them!  Since our brains don't work the same, we can help each other when either of us gets stuck on a level.
B00KA7JIII|5|Great game. I love the visual art and the mechanics are also impressive. It plays like a short story
B00E9A656K|5|I started playing this game on my Android phone and I loved it. So, I was pretty let down when I busted my screen and had to get a new phone. When I did, I got a BlackBerry and couldn't figure out how to get Android games on it, but now that I know how, I'm ecstatic! My only complaint about CSR is that after months of playing, and tons of updates, there still hasn't been an update that allows you to sell your cars. Other than that, I love it. I play it everyday, and for that matter, so do my kids! They have it on their tablets, I have it on my phone, and we all play together. My brother, sister and cousin also play and I love how we can race against each other through logging into Facebook / Twitter! Definitely recommend for anyone who likes cars and racing. It's fun for ALL ages!!
B003XWEQ1G|5|It's different but we don't all like the same,other wise there would not be a Baskin Robbins.<br />Ya think??  I liked it,so rent it or buy it like we did,and relax and enjoy.
0783240236|4|The movie was very entertaining and displayed Hichcock at his best. It may have seemed far-fetched to have birds attacking enmasse. However, individual birds have been known to attack humans during the nesting season. Besides the excellent performances by the leads, the supporting actors played their part as well. I appreciated the supporting feature covering the making of the movie. It was quite fascinating.
B005LLSNNE|5|Grate show and it was fast streaming, its hard to say there are any cons about it, worth the buy for shure.
B00KA7JIII|1|I have downloaded the app, but it will not install to my Samsung galaxy s4. Is anyone else having this problem? I will change my review once I am able to install and play the game.
0425263924|1|I don't know where to begin.  The story line with Eva and Gideon was the same-old, same-old.  Rehashing the same issues.  There were some new twists but I couldn't bring myself to care about them. They bored me and I kept wondering how this would end.  Then  I was flabbergasted when I realized that the story wasn't over!  So much for a trilogy.  So I read 300+ pages of crap and learned that more crap would be coming.  I don't think so - I'm so done with this series.
B007PT3QOQ|5|this is one of the very few games that myself and my 7 yr old can play together. He understands all of the function and we enjoy playing it everyday
B00127RAJY|5|I absolutely think this video is worth every penny. I have used other videos and none have kept me so motivated like the 30 day shred. Anyone can do it and it's easy to follow along.I already see a great difference in my shape.
B004VMUS9G|5|Alarm Clock Xtreme is a great app.<br />Easy to use and has all the features I could ask for.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1608871045|5|I bought it to my son and he just love it. A real nice book for the Batman fans. I really recommend it.
B0017SWSCW|5|The soft beginning gradually grabs you as you plunge head first into a twisting story of intrigue and drama.<br />You know the ending from the beginning, but you are carried along as the story unfolds. You read and turn the pages as if hypnotized by the writer. A tale well told.
B000000H3Z|5|This album is the best for me. I think Sepultura was at the top on this album Beneath The Remains!!!
B009ZQC7MY|4|Good story and the ability to download a season's worth to my TiVo at will as wanted was a GREAT feature!
B0089LOG02|5|This story grabbed me from the start and I didn't want to put the book down once I began reading it.
B00BSBUZT6|5|Greatest band ever
B0012YYZYK|5|no problem with the shipping and no problem with the disc itself. i love this movie and i am glad that i now have a copy for myself
B00GH4RKYM|4|I had seen this movie at the theater already, but I loved the plot but had to watch it with some friends who have not seen it before and they loved it as well
B00AGOGOLE|5|I enjoy this app.since the kindle fire doesn't come with a video recording option this is perfect. And takes quality images and sound. Have fun with it!
B00N0YIQFE|4|I'm enjoying this album and already have a few favorite tracks: Breakdown, Time, Clouds, and The Gold Standard immediately come to mind. Is it a classic? I dunno but IMO anyone saying it is or isn't after less than a day of listening is out of their mind. Too many people are quick to call Classic nowadays. Buy the album and judge for yourself.
B00005JHCP|5|Masterpiece Theater does it again! This is the debut of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Daniel Radcliffe. Ironically enough, quite a few of the cast members of this PBS miniseries have performed together, especially cast members from &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; This is a perfect film...no flaws at all. Comparable to the PBS miniseries,<BR>&quot;Moll Flanders.&quot;
0131480057|4|The book is pretty good. It spends time on the inner-workings of UNIX/LINUX, and less on common commands, but then the book is entitled &#34;UNIX and LINUX System Administration Handbook&#34;. Excellent for System Administrators and those who want a deeper understanding as to the inner-workings of the OS. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is a UNIX/LINUX administrator or who wants an &#34;under-the-hood&#34; understanding of UNIX/LINUX. I would give this book a 4 1/2 stars, but only allowed to rate either 4 stars or 5 stars.
B003WQT2YY|5|Great move
B00AZMFK3K|5|Chars Pine did an exclent job in makeing this move I'm looking forward to his next movie. The crew of startrek made you want to be there with them. I just hope we will have a world like that in being able to have teolgical  .
B000R7GKQE|5|The quality of the DVD is beyond my expectation, the extras are great! (Although they are a bit difficult to find) I love the commentaries and behind the scenes and every extra they provided, they are not only entertaining but also containing many interesting information, like folklores, legends, and what the directors/producers do when filming the show...from these I can see how they treat their fans, and it makes me, a big SN fan, feel so happy.     It's worth buying, even  from the other side of the pacific ocean! :-)
B009GEBBNQ|5|Okay im guilty... love this movie along with all its counter parts.<br /><br />its full of action, suspense, drama. love... it has it all.<br /><br />BTW iron man 3.... AMAZING!!!
B00GINENG0|5|I am in love with this game!! It's so fun to watch my little Tom cat grow into a full adult. Luckily I'm still  having a preschooler cat you should get the game it's fun and u don't have to buy coins! The games are easy so it's easy to get coins. You can also visit other people's Tom cats! I hope you enjoy this game I do to.
B001RXB4FY|5|I first heard the song \\"Still Counting\\" on XM Satellite radio on the Octane channel.  What a cool song!!!! The lead singer's voice makes me think of the singer in Franz Ferdinand (only a little more deeper and stronger).  Then the Pantera-like riffs start in, and it sounds like all hell is breaking loose. One thing about this band:  THEY F......ROCK!!!!! Denmark has sent upon us a cool band.<br /><br />The entire CD rocks!!!! From \\"Still Counting\\" to the remake of Hank Williams, Sr.'s \\"I'm So Lonely I Could Cry\\", it never disappoints.  This CD is worth the money spent.
B00BP4WAZS|5|Great Movie, glitch was my best character. Wreck-it Ralph is now my favorite movie to watch with my cousin and friends.
B007HACDLK|4|Pretty realistic story in Pakistan and Afghanistan. It had me intrigued also because of the very real circumstances in these fareastern countries where we seem to have interests to stabilize the world. Recommendable book

B004GUSG4M|5|I love the Dr. Cross movies.
B000UZNSWM|4|Excellent book. I was there so it is nice to know what really happened and why. It's sad to realize how much was screwed up and the lives lost because of that
B00A3NQNUU|5|It's a great game but these annoying ads pop up every once and a while but I love the dragons and all I think it's a great game and its free
B0088X7YU0|2|Formula kill the bug rescue survivors and whatever you do keep them off the Earth.<br /><br />Looks like they could not afford to keep making pictures with people and needed to switch to cartoons. This could also make a good advertisement for a game.<br /><br />You can see that this was made after the films as it is more of an extension of the films than an attempt to recreate the original writing. They were able to completely strip the film of any original thought that that Robert A. Heinlein was trying to express.<br /><br />What is even weirder is the voice over commentary of the film where they say they are trying to be true to the book. However I suspect they only read the first film script and have no idea that there was a book.<br /><br />Bottom line better suits cheaper dialog with a Japanese feel.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0441014100 Starship Troopers]]

0439813786|5|Have you ever imagined living by yourself at age ten, in the walls of one of the busiest train stations in all of France? Well, Hugo Cabret, age ten experienced this all before he was old enough to have minimum wage.<br />Even though he was very young, when his father died in a fire and he went to live with his Uncle Jim who was the time keeper in the train station. One day after Uncle Jim was done with work he went missing for many days. Hugo thought that since his uncle was a drunk he ended up somewhere he was not supposed to be. As a result Hugo decides since his job was so important he needed to continue his uncle's job for him. Having many paychecks pilled up in corners, is what Hugo had, nothing special. Since he was alone, he could not deposit the pay checks because once again, he was too young. When I read this book, I thought that I have a life that I am fortunate for because I do not need to steel food from shops. After I read this book, I though this was the best book I have ever read. I would have to rate this book five stars. I would have to rate it five stars because this book came to life for me. Even though this book is over two-hundred pages of pictures, this book seamed than a book with imagery it seemed like a book that told a life story from one to another.<br /><br />  ~S.B.A.
6304288433|4|In some ways, Halloween 2 is original. Instead of fast-forwarding one  year, it picks up right where the original left off. It maintains the  original cast and adds more to the story instead of simply rehashing the  story from the original. In many ways, however... it falters. The star,  Jamie Lee Curtis, is reduced to crawling around and murmuring like a stroke  victim. Donald Pleasence often shouts the exact same speeches he shouted in  the first movie and the new actor portraying Michael Mysers doesn't look AT  ALL like the actor who played him in part 1. Whoo! Those faults aside,  Halloween 2 does deliver the goods. Characters aren't lined up one by one  and knocked off like in most horror movies. They are slowly and  methodically bumped off in rather memorable ways without disturbing the  slowly building suspense. The ending, by the way, is a knock-out. If the  series would have ended here I would have been greatly pleased. It  didn't... and because of that fact (and that fact alone) Halloween 2 does  feel a little dated. But make no doubt about it, this is as good as horror  sequels get.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Always a treat.  Can't wait for the new season.
B004SRPXWQ|5|I have used this product more times than I care to admit.  We all need to decompress sometimes and Tom Cat does it for me.  When someone makes me mad, I pop Tom in the face until he falls back and when he stands up, I punch him again.  Talking Tom Cat II is also a lot of fun and Talking Pierre (the Parrot) All of them are free and can be very tranquilizing.  I know plenty of adults who have downloaded this program and feel it is therapeutic.  My accountant turned me on to him and loves him.  When he gets finished with his clients for the day, he says everything he wanted to say to them but couldn't to Tom including &#34;Shut Up&#34; and when Tom says it back to him, he cracks up. All of his stress lines release from his face.  Sounds silly but can be quite relaxing at the end of a hectic day.

B00133KFGW|4|a great movie
0380820846|3|it took them so long to send me the book i thought i was not going to get it, just like once before and i had already gone to the book store and had them order it (hastings). i got both the old book and the new one from the book store on the same day.  i had waited 21/2 weeks before i went to the book store to order and i got both just last week.  considering i paid as much for the shipping cost as i did for the book for this lady and i think i should have gotten the book within a week
B00BAXFECK|4|The book had an Interesting plot and characters you really got invested in.  Couldn't put it down all vacation.  Thumbs up.
B004ZZS4CC|4|Fascinating how strong this young woman was throughout her ordeal.  I found her story to be inspiring.  She stayed brave and strong for her children and survived.  She is amazing!
B0072OFM28|5|Was so glad it was reasonably priced so I could purchase all.  I loved this series.  Definitely would recommend .
0800137841|1|If you spend more than 10 cents on this film, it's a dime too much.Kenneth &quot;I should stick to Shakespeare&quot;Brannaugh's adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel is flatulent at best. If you are a true horror fan in need of  some heavy-duty laughter, this one's for you!!!!
B003PDQEBS|5|Colin Firth is such a wonderful actor and he fufilled his role in the script to a tee.  I could really feel his pain and it broke my heart.
0375714669|5|I didn't find it quite as engrossing as the first, but I still enjoyed it very much. As some noted, I haven't seen any missing pages. My copy came with hardly a scratch (it was used). I also don't know why there were a few reviews complaining about 'foul' language. There was a little more than the first, but hardly any compared to other books and films.
B005JLN9ZI|5|This is the best album I have purchased in 2011 hands down.Though it is a bit more R&B than rap , Drake has shown that his talent is limitless!

B009ZQC7MY|5|loved the new characters.didn't like the surprise ending though.love that i can get all seasons here.Can't wait to get season 4.
B004KKX80A|5|Its an awesome Bey but pretty wild when spinning but you can alter that by changing the position of 2nd fusion wheel.
B0090SI56Y|5|Great movie for the price.., and a Friday night...
B007J4T2G8|2|I hated the repetitive phrases and how it seemed like a high school girl wrote this in her secret notebook alone in her room. I probably will buy the rest of the trilogy with the hopes that maybe there will be more substance. I feel like the last few pages of this book for really interesting and I got very invested in it, but then it just ended, leaving me disappointed.
B00KMX5V8G|4|All these games are fun; but one must not forget that they are created for money-making purposes. So, after a point, they become annoyingly difficult, and some levels will have you stuck even for weeks. So, either pay to get these power-ups, or treat the game as a simple pastime, or download another similar game when this one gets very tough. It's up to you!
B008Y2FRFO|4|This is a fun game.  When you purchase any in-game content for real money however, be warned it takes several minutes.  I think this is actually an Amazon issue, as other apps are the same way.
B00FKF0F3C|4|The historical aspects were great review of history.  The characters were interesting and the overall story so typical of that period.  Good read.
B00IRISI42|5|You will thank me if you read it ! Allow yourself the privilege of getting to know the Pullers . A great read all around . I can't wait for the next book in this series!
B000XUBFE2|5|just lovely.  this book combines history and fiction to make wonderful view on world war two.  also read to find out who the narrator really is.
B004ZRV3AU|5|Simple and great it's kind of addictive  I find my self keeping all the beer and wine bottles so I can score them during the weekends
0312853238|5|I rate this book on a scale of one to ten a 1,000!  It is my second faveorite book in the world because of all the action.  You should buy it and or read it.  I liked it because it keeps you reading with its action packed suspense.  I liked it because it is science fiction.  Also, it is  very interesting.  The basic plot is a kid that goes to a battle school and  becomes the stongest general ever at the age of 11.
0062409859|4|Its not the greates book, but its a good one. Check out the website http://cheapkidsstuff.com for some good items.
B00BD99JMW|3|Was looking forward to finishing the trilogy, but it was definitely a huge let down after the first two books.
1564029654|5|Every working mother needs a copy of this book for her and her babies.  I keep a few handy to give as baby gifts to all the new moms whose work (or other activities) take them away from their babies on occasion.  In this comforting story the mom always returns to her babies.  Very reassuring story for mothers and babies.  The illustrations are lovely too.
B00B7Y0206|1|I constantly need to delete and redownload the app. Freezes alot and most definitely needs an update. Won't load when I refresh the page or try to search videos.
B00J8CGU64|4|Good movie kinda drawn out for me tho
0316227706|5|I got this book for my parents for Christmas, since we had a labrador who used to swim laps and retrieve toys from the bottom of our backyard pool every summer.  It was a hit on Christmas morning, and my dad even took it along with us when we visited other relatives so he could share it.  It's a great gift for any dog lover, especially people who are partial to labs.
B004HXIZVC|4|It is amazing but if you didn't already know the kindle doesn't have a microphone you can buy one starting at 3 dollars, other than that it is a good app.
B00A0SQBDM|4|Fun game. Good  graphics, Make you feel as if you are there. Mini games are very simple. Good way to kill a few hours.
B00IK1J9QM|4|&#34;Personal&#34; is one of the better adventures of Major Jack Reacher, Retired. All of his adventures provide great entertainment, but this is better than average. It's a bit unusual, in that it takes place mostly in the E.U. instead of the U.S. Good description of the atmosphere of Paris and London (where the readers get a glimpse in the workings of a native criminal organization). The novel gives what it promises; highly recommended for fans of America's Sherlock Homeless.<br /><br />(Scale: * - unreadable, couldn't finish. ** - bad or very bad, but readable. *** - good work, well worth its price. **** - very good in its genre. ***** - timeless masterpiece.)
B001IBIQU6|5|After three years of waiting, Depeche Mode are back with their 12th original studio release, the epically grand titled: [[ASIN:B001IBIQU6 \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"]]  The band came up with the name quite early on in the process. Songwriter, Martin Gore, has said that the title just felt like it summed up the eclectic nature of the songs and the sounds on the album.  While he feels there is no overall theme, the album tends to focus on different aspects of relationships, both positive and negative.  This is a lighter, more laid back `Mode, with the album a cross between 2001s [[ASIN:B00005BL2A \\"Exciter\\"]] and 2005s [[ASIN:B000B2YQX4 \\"Playing The Angel\\"]] with a little [[ASIN:B000002LK1 \\"Violator\\"]] thrown in for good measure.  In fact, while this isn't DM at their darkest, there are very noticeable moments of darkness on the album, as well as a retro feel.  This is due in part to the fact that, during the recording sessions, Martin would constantly be winning auctions on eBay for classic older electronic equipment, incorporating them into the productions.  As with \\"Playing The Angel,\\" Martin wrote most of the songs on \\"Sounds Of The Universe,\\" with lead singer, Dave Gahan, providing writing credits for three songs (*).        \\"In Chains\\" starts things off with a one minute intro, reminiscent of how a live orchestra sounds like when they're tuning up their instruments.  Only here it's a bunch of electronic equipment that's preparing to play a piece of music, with lots of strange noises and other odd sounds going off one after the other, until all is in readiness.  Then what sounds like an electric organ begins to play the main melody, which almost sounds like something you might hear during a funeral procession.  Until Dave Gahan's voice comes crying out with sexy allure, proclaiming his adulation for the seductive power of the woman he desires, (\\"The way you move, has got me yearning.  The way you move, has left me burning.  I know you know what you're doing to me.I know my hands will never be free.  I know what it's like to be in chains\\") and the way she controls him (\\"I know I crumble when you are around.  Stutter, mumble, a pitiful sound.  Stagger, stumble, shackled and bound, in chains\\") with her sexual powers of persuasion (\\"You've got me dying for you.  It's you that I'm living through.  You've got me praying to you, saying to you anything you want me to...You've got me reaching for you.  My soul's beseeching me to.  You've got me singing to you, bringing to you anything you ask me to\\") that always wins over in the end.  Martin Gore adds a funky guitar riff throughout the song that gives it a bit more bite, along with his affective backing vocalizations that are always a crowd pleaser.        \\"Hole To Feed,\\"* which sounds more like a Nine Inch Nails title, opens with a cool little beat and an array of retro electric laser beam sounds, as it's formatted interestingly in a chorus-verse-chorus motif.  The song centers on the maintaining of a serious and meaningful relationship. (\\"We are here, we can love. We share something.  I'm sure that you mean the world to me.\\") But with all relationships, there are pros (\\"You opened my eyes to a world that I could believe.\\"...\\"The games that we're playing, they've left us hoping\\") and there are cons. (\\"When you get what you need, there's no way of knowing what you'll have is another hole to feed\\")  The real point here is that real love takes hard work and dedication, and it doesn't always turn out quite the same way we expect it to be.  It's a nice tune with a very poignant message that's rumored to become a future single.        \\"Wrong,\\" the first single taken from the album, immediately begins with a unified chanting of the title name, four times in a row, until Dave Gahan's voice explodes into the first verse (\\"I was born with the wrong sign, in the wrong house, with the wrong ascendancy\\") subjecting the listener to a torrent of negative outcries (\\"I took the wrong road that leadto the wrong tendencies\\") and self-deprecations (\\"There's something wrong with me chemically, something wrong with me inherently\\") that signify an essence of decay and hopelessness (\\"I was marching to the wrong drum, with the wrong scum, pissing out the wrong energy\\") yet is still able to retain that one bleak glow of hopefulness (\\"With the wrong tune played till it sounded alright, yeah!\\") that rings true. The word, \\"Wrong,\\" is actually used a total of 72 times (including backing vocals) on this original album version. It's got a fast groove with a heavy techno backbeat that'll have you singing along and dancing to your heart's content.  A music video, directed by Patrick Daughters, was released; portraying an unknown man (Julian Gross from American art rock legends Liars) tied and gagged inside a car that is slowly rolling backwards down a long road to his death.  The band only have a quick 5 second cameo, which is a little disappointing, but the video itself is eerily dark, bleak, and pure Depeche Mode.        \\"Fragile Tension\\" is another excellent track from Sounds Of The Universe that also discusses the intricacies of relationships (\\"There's a fragile tension that's keeping us going.  It may not last forever, but oh when it's flowing\\") and the strength and power the right kind of chemistry conjures up between two people. (\\"There's a strange obsession that's drawing us nearer.  We don't understand it, it never gets clearer\\") Despite the problems and difficulties, they always seem be able to pull closer together in the end. (\\"Oh when we're teetering on the edge of collapse, nothing can keep us down\\")  The song has a strongly positive and powerful message with a great beat, a wonderful guitar performance by Martin Gore, as well as a beautiful vocal job by Dave Gahan. (\\"There's something radical in our hands, nothing logical to our plans\\") This track has \\"Hit Single\\" written all over it!        \\"Little Soul\\" is indeed a soulful little tune with an introspective, yet slightly vain, viewpoint. (\\"My little light is going to shine.  Shine out so bright and illuminate your mind.  My little soul will leave a footprint\\") The song has some nice vocal duo moments between Gahan and Gore, with a slow, quiet, and easygoing melody that, while sounding pretty, (\\"I'm channeling the universe that's focusing itself inside of me...a singularity\\") still retains that usual DM melodic sense of melancholy. (\\"My little words are going to sting.  Haven't you heard the pain and joy they bring?\\") It's a pretty tune, which calms things down a bit.        \\"In Sympathy\\" picks things right back up again with its nicely moody up tempo sound, (\\"They're almost falling over you.  Why don't they call a truce?  Whatever they are trying to do, it's of little use\\") as Dave plays an onlooker to a beautiful and intelligent woman, whose physical attributes bring her much notice. (\\"They're drowning you in compliments, trying to furnish proof.  And though they speak with eloquence, there is little truth\\") The chorus is fraught with positive reinforcements, (\\"You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong, at least to some degree.  You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough.  You smile, in sympathy\\") and coupled with the nice beat, Dave's great vocals, and Martin's alluring guitar work, it makes for a nice morality tale with some good-spirited heart and soul. (\\"And as the night begins to fade, you're heading for the door.  Followed by a sad parade; you're on your own once more\\") Longtime fans may recognize a swirling noise throughout the song that's reminiscent of a sound used prominently in the 1984 track: [[ASIN:B00004WSBM \\"People Are People,\\"]] which gives this new tune an added retro feel to it.  It's a lovely song that has the makings of another \\"Hit Single.\\"        \\"Peace,\\" the second single taken from the album, has an affirmation vibe about it, (\\"Peace will come to me\\") along with a bit of an Erasure-esque sound quality, as Dave goes through his positive mantra (\\"I'm leaving bitterness behind this time, I'm cleaning out my mind.  There is no space for the regrets I will remember to forget\\") which gives off this glowing ray of hope & happiness, (\\"I'm leaving anger in the past with all the shadows that it cast.  There is a radar in my heart I should have trusted from the start\\") something you don't usually find, on a regular basis, in a Depeche Mode album, (\\"Just look at me.  I'm a living act of holiness.  Giving all the positivity that I possess, I'm going to light up the world\\") that's nicely done.        \\"Come Back\\"* is one of those tracks that just get better, over time, with each listen.  Here we have Dave begging and pleading for that special someone to return into his life (\\"Come back.  Come back to me.  I've been waiting patiently\\") as he bares his soul (\\"Walking a thin white line between love and hate.  Wasting all of my time in another world...in another place.  I could use a little company, a little kindness can go a long way\\") and appears to be waiting in vain. (\\"Weeks turn into months, months turn into years.  Reaching the same conclusions, gathering up the fear\\") Gahan, always the hopeless romantic, evokes a personal, poetic longing and sweet sincerity, (\\"Light will always shine in the heart of you.  In truth and in reality, only blindness can hide it away\\") which gives the song its power and additional beauty.  Nicely executed by Mr. Gahan.        \\"Spacewalker\\" is a short, nearly two minute, instrumental interlude that's reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000SFJVZM \\"Easy Tiger,\\"]] from 2001's Exciter.  It has an outer-world, space age feel to it, with a moderate beat and an upbeat melody.  While the interlude ends all too briefly, it sets things up nicely for the next track on the album.        \\"Perfect,\\" again, continues the whole relationship motif of the album, this time with the idea of using other dimensions & realities to tell the story. (\\"On another world by another star, in another place in time.  In another state of consciousness, in another state of mind\\") And each reality has slightly different outcomes, (\\"Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place.  The jury reached a different verdict, before the judge dismissed the case\\") some positive, (\\"In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side, and no one's hurt and no one's cursed and no one needs to hide\\") some negative. (\\"I didn't shoot, I didn't pull the trigger.  It wasn't me.  I'm just a plain and simple singer.  I heard the sound, I turned my head around, to watch our love shot down\\") But the true constant, no matter what reality we experience, is that people, and life in general, are never easy.  It's always a lot of hard work and dedication that make anything in this world worthwhile.  This track is already rumored to be a future single, and that's not surprising, as it's a great track and a definite highlight from \\"Sounds Of The Universe.\\"        \\"Miles Away / The Truth Is\\"* gets its odd name from the mere fact that when the band heard that Madonna already had a song out called \\"Miles Away,\\" they didn't want their song to have the exact same title, so it was altered to include \\"The Truth Is.\\"  It's a funky tune, with Dave discussing the mundane and repetitive aspects of getting to know someone (\\"It's one of those conversations we've, we've had them before.  The ones that leave you empty and wanting for more\\") and that déjà vu feeling of having done it so many times before (\\"Excuse me for my hesitation I've, I've met you before.  Your face seems so familiar and longing for more\\") you start to wonder if anyone out will ever be right for you. (\\"With all your superstitions and empty lines, I could be just like you, withdrawn but alive\\") Accepting the fact that we're not always given the things we want most in this world, (\\"Life, it has its limitations.  We all have our needs.  Love could be the only answer.  It lies underneath\\") the struggle to continue on, in the hopes of some day finding them can sometimes leave us feeling isolated. (\\"Your eyes, they tell me something that I understand.  Your eyes, they hold the truth and the truth is, your miles away\\")       \\"Jezebel\\" leads us to the only lead vocal track by Martin Gore on the album.  The song, which has an eerily dark calypso feel to it, focuses on the subject of female promiscuity, (\\"They call you Jezebel whenever we walk in.  You're going straight to hell for wanton acts of sin, they say, and that I'll have to pay.  But I need you just this way\\") and feels almost like a direct sequel to the song, \\"Lilian,\\" from \\"Playing The Angel.\\" (\\"They call you Jezebel for what you like to wear.  You're morally unwell.  They say you'll never care for me\\") But the biggest difference is perspective, whereas Dave had spoken about this topic in a much darker more objective tone, Martin's take is much more optimistic and forgiving. (\\"But what they fail to see is that your games are the key.  Open their eyes to the beauty.  Open their hearts to the fun. Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone\\") Martin, as always, does a wonderful job with the song, and gives it an elegant flow with his beautiful vocal work.        \\"Corrupt\\" brings the album to a close with a dark and seductive take on the power struggle between men and women, (\\"I could corrupt you in a heartbeat.  You think you're so special...think you're so sweet.  What are you trying?  Don't even tempt me.  Soon you'll be crying and wishing you'd dreamt me\\") with finger pointing, (\\"You'll be calling out my name, when you need someone to blame\\") and sadomasochistic overtones galore. (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be easy.  Watching you suffer, girl it would please me.  But I wouldn't touch you with my little finger.  I know it would crush you.  My memory would linger\\") Dave Gahan has always possessed those alluringly broody vocals of his, (\\"I could corrupt you.  It would be ugly.  They could sedate you, but what good woulddrugs be?\\") and they work in this song absolutely brilliantly. (\\"You'll be crying out in pain, begging me to play my games\\") It's arguably the best final track on a Depeche Mode album since \\"Clean\\" & \\"Higher Love,\\" with a nicely dark electronic tone, funky guitar riffs, and a groovy beat that ends the album perfectly.  But wait, there's an additional hidden track included later on: an instrumental version of \\"Wrong.\\"        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is another great album by the best electronic band in the world.  If there were anything to criticize it would be the fact that only one Martin Gore lead vocal track was used instead of two.  Martin actually wrote and performed a second track, entitled: \\"The Sun and The Moon and The Stars,\\" which is another beautifully made music number.  But the band felt that it just didn't fit well with the rest of the album, so it was dropped.  It's included, along with 4 other non-album tracks on disc two of the \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" Deluxe Edition.  Even so, the album is a triumph and another milestone for Depeche Mode.  Pick it up and enjoy.        \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\": Give Into The Corruption.

B004FHP9KA|1|My genius 11 year old said it was the best movie he had ever seen.  I couldn't make heads or tails of it.  It  was completely incomprehensible....<br /><br />I am certain that all the people that loved it on IMDB are liars.
0800132343|5|This is not a blockbuster action film, nor an action packed war movie. It is a REAL WAR movie. When the crew is scared, your scared. When the crew is bored, you are bored. When the crew gets out of a bad situation, you cheer with them. This is the greatest war movie ever made. Everything feels and sounds real. Watch this movie, especially the ending, and you'll never want to join a war. Ever.

B00080ZG10|4|The Aviator traces the life of legendary billionaire, playboy, independent filmmaker, and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes from 1927 to 1947. <br /> <br />The story begins during production of Hughes' air battle epic Hell's Angels, delayed due to his fixation with insignificant details. When the end of filming coincided with the advent of talkies, Hughes reshot the entire picture with sound -- at a cost of $4 million, it was the most expensive picture ever made. <br /> <br />Hughes' obsession with aircraft would continue. He later bought TWA, set an air speed record, created a spy plane (and suffered extreme injuries and burns in a spectacular crash during its test flight), and also built and flew the infamous troop ship dubbed the Spruce Goose. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the tortured industrialist, despite his squeaky voice and the fact he bears no resemblance to Hughes. Completely assuming the role, it is the best performance of his career. Not only do we see Hughes' genius, but the beginnings of his OCD, paranoia, and fear of germs, all of which foreshadows the recluse to come. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, with whom Hughes had a lengthy and torrid relationship, is astounding; she perfectly recreates the unique vocalizations and bearing of the screen icon. Also appearing in smaller roles are Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and singer Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. <br /> <br />Under the capable hands of director Martin Scorsese, the film is stylish and riveting. The story advances quickly with no extraneous scenes, but ends up being a little too long. Further, due to Scorsese's own obsession with putting art over entertainment, he has inexplicably and needlessly tinted everything green in the first half of the movie blue. <br /> <br />Overall, The Aviator is a magnificent depiction of a decadent time and those who lived it. For them, the Depression and WWII were nothing more than trivialities in the news. A captivating era. A captivating man. A captivating film. Rating: 8 out of 10. <br />
B00V4JHNZG|2|Meh.
B00L9B7IKE|1|Did not like this book. I wish I would have known they used the &#34;f&#34; word. I try to avoid books that use offensive words.
B0089EHWQE|5|Genuine characters and dialogue. This was a thought provoking book. I would highly recommend. Although I would have preferred a different ending, I believe anyone would enjoy this reading.
B0000029DD|5|I consider music to be the most powerful art form because of its ability to convey.  What it conveys is obviously up to the artist, but it seems that all of the other qualities people hold dear in their music, honesty, integrity, passion, etc., can be summed up by saying that good music simply communicates and expresses the self.  It serves as reflection of something that shines within an individual.  <br />That being said, this album is the epitome of all of the above.  Only rarely has all of those qualities been applied to just an artist's voice.  Buckley's gift to the world was how much he could communicate by just singing a note.  There didn't even have to be a word associated with the note, just him singing, and you could instantly see what was going on inside him.<br />I also wanted to address an important aspect of Grace that seems to escape the other reviewers: the backing band.  Matt Johnson is an incredible drummer; not in the Neil Pert or John Bohnam way, but he is just so tight with his playing.  The guitars and strings are arranged to be nothing more than a vehicle to take Buckley's voice somewhere, and they do this in superb fashion.  The production, thanks to industry heavyweight Andy Wallace, is excellent as well, capturing all of the timbres of Buckley's voice as well as his guitar playing.<br />Grace is simply an essential album for anyone that calls themselves a music lover.  I know some people will fail to see the beauty of this record, especially now in the age of &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;extreme.&quot;  Grace is neither sick or extreme.  It doesn't need to be.  All of those sick and extreme bands are hiding behind their &quot;sickness&quot; or &quot;extremeness.&quot;  Jeff Buckley isn't hiding, he's baring it all and moving something deep inside me as a result.
B003HTPHSQ|5|I have always loved Cyndi Lauper's voice and her songs from the 80's. She is an artist I have long admired and was anxious to hear how well she would do the blues. I needn't have worried. This CD is INCREDIBLE. There is not one song on it that won't have you dancing, bopping or singing along with. Cyndi's vocals are incredible and she makes you believe the feelings behind the words. I have purchased several CD's this year and by far this is the best one I have bought. This CD will be getting worn out in short order. I highly recommend buying this if you love blues music. You have found another niche for your incredible voice Cyndi...excellent!!!
B00004Z459|5|Well , what can I say? This CD is truly worth buying. I admit that when I first got it , I didn't bother listening to it because their hit song &quot;One Step Closer&quot; was getting played out fast. About a week later , I listened to a few of the other songs. I loved them all. This is only 1 of 3 CDs in the world i can listen to from start to finish , and might I add , every song now has a Vegas memory inbedded into my mind. &gt;:D

B00004TLMC|1|Eyes Wide Shut is a long, slow journey that leads... nowhere.  While there are some attention-grabbing scenes such as the one in Victor Ziegler's pool room, too much of the film has the feeling that they are trying to fill out time.  Nicole Kidman gives a good performance and Sydney Pollack is very good, but Tom Cruise is, well, the same old cocky, one-dimensional Tom Cruise.  Unknown, bit actors kept showing him up in scene after scene; it got a little embarrasing.  If he wasn't good looking, he would have a hard time getting work.<br />I guess if you have 2.5 hours to kill and don't mind a movie that takes you nowhere, you might enjoy this film.
B005XN3150|5|This is one of the best shows in a long time.  The plot is just great, and so very creative.  I find this very entertaining, and look forward to it each week.

B00005JKEZ|5|This is one of the classic films of all time. Okay, it isn't terribly deep, but the combination of a dynamite cast, very decent scripting of a classic tale, spectacular sets and stuntwork and the medium of Technicolor is irresistable. <br />Olivia deHaviland has never looked lovelier nor more desirable. Flynn, is at his best, Basil Rathbone is Robin's perfect nemesis, Claude Rains brings such light hearted meanness to Prince John and the lesser characters are all top drawer. <br />My wife and I had to watch several other Technicolor costume epics to realize how very good this film is. <br />The added features are fun and informative, from the pieces on Howard Hill, the great archer who made the shots in the film, to the story of the Technicolor process, to the behind-the-scenes footage. The whole package is a treasure and a worthy addition to any DVD collection.
B0038BBA4I|5|Once you listen to the whole thing, you'll keep listening over and over and over. I am addicted to this album.

B00I8H78J8|5|It has been one of the best movies that intrigued for a long time. It's not just a love story. The character are fun and great acting
B0074PNCRM|4|I didn’t get all emotional over this book but that is not to say I don’t like it. I think this book was beautifully written and as my sisters says, very ‘quote worthy’. Its true there are so many quote moments it’s just not funny.<br />It has finesse and elegance and complete control over every facet of the story. For YA genre you don’t usually get this standard of writing and I think that’s why it has been so successful. And great for the promotion of the YA genre!<br />Not only that, but is a beautiful illustration of the unfairness of life. Of the fact that we aren’t and life isn’t that special, and making a big a splash doesn’t really change that.<br /><br />Read my review on my blog: https://bonnievbrown.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/the-fault-in-our-stars/

B00BWBHIUG|3|The games is kind of an underwater Farmville really. Its a little inconsistent in collection, because if it loses connection to the server it counts plants as harvested, but doesn't add it to the total. So you have to be vigilant. It is possible to complete the task without buying pearls, despite what some other reviewers have stated. The rare fish you collect also produce pearls, it just may not be in the time frame you would like. Use caution with pearls as well, because you may get a groove while collecting and end up using a pearl to speed up the next harvest. Why they have that option on a plant that only takes 30 seconds, I fail to see its purpose other than to make you use the pearls. There some other small pet peeves, but those are the main ones.
B00MB8P1OO|5|they love lots
B005NJU8PA|5|Excellent read. Treasure trove of knowledge in one place . Great follow up to the 4 hour Body and the 4 hour work week
B0010SKUYM|4|Not exactly what I was expecting, but still pretty good. I listened to the first half in audio, which might have lowered my enjoyment level just a little. The reader was surely better than I would be in his position, but his ubiquitous &#34;old man&#34; voice was a little hard to take. I would have liked for this volume to have an entirely self-contained story arc, maybe some kind of climactic pay-off to get me to jump immediately into the second book. For me, that just wasn't there. I'll get around to the second book eventually, but I'm not rushing out to find it at my local library or anything.
0525951652|5|This book is not for everyone.<br /><br />It's involved and somewhat wordy. History buffs would argue with some of the events portrayed, however, I try not to be too judgemental about 'exact'facts.<br /><br />Follet's research is impeccable. I am still amazed how he was able to weave events, people, situations, etc. into this fine work of fiction.  I couldn't wait to read every evening. I felt a part of the characters in Giants.<br /><br />Some would say it's too long. It may be a little, but I knew this going in was never bothered.<br /><br />Thanks Ken, for writing this fine peice of literature. I look forward to reading your next book in this series.
B00FG1Q5J8|4|I really enjoyed this game . The only bad thing is the replay of this game is the same. like most people if I'm paying for a game I hope that the game isn't so short an the replay would be repetitive. You can only do so much each time you play through. Not my cup of tea but hey the game was great. Still a lot of room for improvement. I rate 4 stars cause it is a good game.

B0026P3G12|2|This woman has a beautiful voice and is a sheer joy to listen to. But after several cuts the album becomes a durge, almost depressing. She really needs to put some life and excitement into future recordings and give us songs that are up-beat and fun to listen to. If not, she'll be like so many others - that woman who sang that nice song on stage once upon a time, you know, what's her name.

0316154687|5|In true David Sedaris form, David finds a way of humanizing and finding terrific qualities in despicable people and disgraceful situations in a remarkably humorous and yet beautiful prose. This is one of my favorite books written by him. He never disappoints and he is by far one of the best authors of our time!

B007IXWKUK|2|I never finished all the books (3?) in this series because they got too REPETITIVE and BORING.  And because the books didn't do much for me one way or the other, I passed on the movie, too.  Spend your money on something else, anything else.

B007REV4T8|1|I am a huge fan of the 007 franchise, loved Daniel Craig's perfomance in the first two movies. Skyfall, however, is a serious letdown. The actors are doing the best they can but the story is soooooo tedious and poorly written. Honestly, instead of rating with stars, you could use yawns...<br />The movie is too long, not enough Bond action, and way too many CGI effects (his home in Scotland reminds me of The Woman in Black) ...<br />Seriously, this is not worth the $$$$.
B00EP2PXCY|5|A Parents Review I first heard of Ariana when my daughter introduced me to Victorious. Since I am a mom of a pre-teen I tend to listen to (and watch) a few things that dare call themselves entertainment. I am 30 so I still have a young heart, but as a parent, some of the music these days worries me. So, I like to listen to (and watch) what my kids do to kind of censor what they take it daily. Long story short (if that's possible) I instantly was drawn to Ariana. I can honestly say that she reminds me a young Mariah Carey with her sultry mature voice and her vocal range. When I first heard &#34;The Way&#34; I thought it was a new Mariah song, even my boyfriend thought so! When we discovered it was Ariana, I was floored. If you watched her on Victorious, you know she was quirky and awkward! This is far from awkward, this is well put together and well presented. There are some songs that are very &#34;POPPY&#34; to me, but for $3.99 I will buy the whole album and play the heck out of the 5 or 6 songs that I like. &#34;Almost Is Never Enough&#34; has to be my favorite. Really brings back that feel of Etta James and Billie Holiday! This album is a must for both parents and their kids as it has something for everyone to enjoy!
B00IG2DOKM|4|Enjoyable game.....but a bit slow to start.....and the amount of experience points needed from level to level can be a bit too much at times.....but overall an enjoyable game......
B00OY0G2LI|5|My previous charger kept blinking and charging intermittently, so a new charger was in order. So, after pluging it in the car lighter, I found the new charger was much more capable and no intermittent charging. I like it! Hey, Mikey! I like it!!
B00N0T38LG|5|Badass album fast delivery
B00KTDD69A|3|It's OK for a kindle game.  It is good for filling time.
B000KQF6X0|5|What can I say, I love this movie! I've already got the DVD, but I still want to get the Blu-ray version, that said it all. This is the one of the best work from Michael Douglas. And Ridley Scott is still the best Director in Hollywood IMO.
B0025UHKNS|5|Good product
B009UX2YAC|5|Great game it keeps you going with its many layers which make is very interesting. I personally hav  not figure out everything yet but im looking forward to trying.
B000058983|5|If you have never heard of Love I can't blame you. They never really made a huge national impact, and their songs aren't played on the radio. I personally stumbled upon this piece de resistance while rummaging through a bargain bin; I still can't believe it! Pulling you in and never letting go, this often melodic and shimmering album tells a tale of the world in the 1960's as lived by one Arthur Lee. Never heard of him either? Well, he was friends with Jimy Hendrix, and did have his own band throughout the 70's, but here, he was in peak form. Guitars and violins never sounded so nice together, and the bluesy, almost Johnny Mathis style vocals only add velvet to the air this album excreates. Tell friends about this one so that when it's reissued again for the next generation, it isn't lost like it's fellow relics; the Excalibur or Christs' Chalice.
B00M1SRBS8|5|I'ts great

B00PTB7B34|5|this game is varey cool and that is what I like about games
0446310786|5|Granted, this book is required reading for many ninth grade english classes (I know it was for me), which could make kids not like it.  But, even at 13, when I first read it, I fell in love with it because it made me think.   As I got older, I started to realize the very deep nature of the kind of  person Atticus was and the values he was teaching his children in the deep  south.  I can't help but admire Atticus deeply for the man he is and what  he wants his children to be.  The racism in this book is overwhelmingly  powerful and strives to show the injustices that was and still are a large  part of this nation.  It doesn't promote it; it makes us aware.  For all  those ninth graders out there who read this book by command of a teacher,  pick it up again in a couple years and then tell me if it was deep or  lacking in the american classic ability.  You might be surprised by what  you find.
B005HSG3U6|5|this case has to be one of my favorite cases of all.love the compact feel this case gives to me while using
B00HBQWGXK|1|Lee Chlds must not have written this one!
B002U3CCKQ|5|At times I had to stop reading, to just put the book down and breathe fresh air. This story will pull you in like no other and then throw you like never before. Heartbreakingly painful.
1439152799|5|The book was not as good as The Forgotten Garden. But it was a great read. Lots of detail and great character development.
B00992CF6W|5|You guys need to get this app it is not like the computer but you can play two players and do survival or creative
B00000IAU3|5|I saw Dido in concert when she opened for Sting and I was really  impressed.  She has a very beautiful voice and an obvious talent for  songwritting.   She credits her entre into the industry from the influence  she received from Sting.  Remember her name, she is going places.
6304712944|5|Camelot (Special Edition)<br /><br />We bought this DVD to replace an old VCR tape version.  We love this classic movie.<br />It a true romantic story.
B00HYTNBU6|5|however, I would have cursed way before he does and possible done a few things differently!  It was really a great film our man is outstanding in his role.
B00005AQE8|5|2pac, alive or dead has caught the eyes and heart of true rap fans out there. I have been listening to Rap for about 2 years now. I never listened to 2pac because none of his songs attracted me. I asked my friend why did people like 2pac so much? He told me that I had to listen to what he says. I listened and noticed that he says the game for real and he is not playing. He know what he saying and his style is unique. Just try rapping with him and u will see how different he is. Truly a thug. He didnt care wut u though bout him. He had a revenge and he dissed anybody. Even the District Attorney(check &quot;Picture me rolling&quot;). In &quot;No more pain&quot; he describes a little about his daily life as a thug and woman around him. Truly the greatest!!!!!!
B003UESJF6|4|Will Farrell's movies are generally not family-friendly, but Elf and this one are VERY FUNNY and SAFE for the entire family.  Voice talents are great throughout (Ferrell is superb), plot is unique, as are the characters.  We laugh all the way through this one even after seeing it 4 times.  My kids (16 and 13) quote it often.
B0083Z614S|5|This book is definitely one of the best in the market. Mr. Burnett has described every moment with the sensory elements of writing, combined with fun and strong vocabulary. I strongly recommend it to children.
B00SXK316E|5|Overall, good show. Not a waste of time.
B000WGWQG8|5|To begin with, David McCullough's acclaimed biography is fine literature as well as history and Tom Hanks' production takes the story another step into emotional depth.  Having seen them in recent films, I was at first distracted by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney as John and Abigail Adams.  But as the series went on, Giamatti and Linney disappeared and simply became John and Abigail.  The short, squat Adams seemed out of place in the pantheon of Founding Fathers.  This series shows that without his stubborn spirit (which was often not appreciated) the American Revolution would likely have failed.  And without Abigail's \\"ballast,\\" as John called it, John would likely not have been able to be the force he was.  In addition to seeing this country come into being, we see the intimate relationship of a remarkable couple as they face years of separation due to his work, tragedies with their children, scorn from the public and other elected officials, and difficult living conditions.  (Most of their life is on their farm, which they work themselves, and they move into the White House when it is half finished.  An interesting footnote is that the U.S. White House, now inhabited by an African American family, was built largely by slave labor.)  Director Tom Hooper does not pretty things up, giving a deep sense of realism to the film.  What a great way to learn American history!
B00280LYIM|5|I love greek myth and if you do too you will love this book. I read it many times. It is a great book filled with action and adventure.
B004J4WKUQ|5|If you enjoy science-Fiction and if you are above 40yo... you HAVE to read this book!!!<br /><br />It's totally fun, well written, action packed with a great story.<br /><br />Go ahead... read it!
B00DPM7TIG|5|This novel is simply amazing! Perfectly written and a true delight to read from start to finish. Highly recommend!

B005LAIII0|4|very good
B004XMMSZG|1|It didn't work. Tried it in multiple environments without success. Still in the process of getting things ironed out, hopefully things will get better.
B009G7ZYPY|4|This cd is the best that she has done so far. I would recommend it to anyone. I loaned it to my neighbor next door. She liked it so much that she ordered the cd too.

B0024F08UG|5|Classic film, great stars, great story, very happy.
0802130208|1|If you need to add words to your lexicon, this is the book for you.  It will not entertain you, it will not make you feel smarter, it will not make people think you are smarter...after they read it too. The lead character is the type of person everyone can hate.  The plot line isn't even started until the 90th page.  It is filled with long-winded diatribes from the exceptionally iratating lead character.  [...]
B00AAQRNQ8|5|Good
B0011V9XT6|5|A must-have blu-ray title! Excellent audio and video with an almost complete line-up of songs from Beyonc&eacute;.
0307592731|3|Living in POrtland, Oregon has its share of ups and downs - mostly ups.  Mostly legal.  But some down, and some not so legal.  It strikes me as not coincidental that the author lives in Portland.  The book, the city, and the trip described have much in common - some wet spots and some dry spots, people living outside the societal norm but being affected by society, wanting to be free yet needing things that only money can buy - like food, water, and shelter.<br /><br />I could really relate to the author's roller coaster emotions after losing her mother, and glad that she took us along for her trip of healing. The book is very interesting and fun to read - what will happen next?  will her feet hold up?  Will she make it to the next supply drop? But don't read this book if you are an organized, rational, planning, Type A personality.  The author's lack of preparation and poor decisions (lifestyle, hiking preparations, money, etc.) will make you crazy.
B002BIULQ2|1|Great movie love it
B00003CX6P|5|The TMR moview is a masterpiece of suspense and a commentary of the ex-pat Lost Generation. This generation is the American young and wealthy crowd that seeks excitement and fun in each European city during a period when a buck was a buck in the early 50s. It is the time when Daddy's trust account could hide and erase sins and when thrills did not yet discover nose poweder, but skiing on the slopes and boating. Still true today, more so back then when the Net, data bases, and TV did not exist and did not flesh out the truth as readily.<br />Rather than rehash the plot, which has already been done on this board, I would like to offer this film as another commentary on the &quot;money is bad&quot; image, found in works such as Great Gatsby. The characters who have money in this movie, all have  dubious qualities; getting girls pregnant, trying to marry right, trying to party right,etc. That is acceptable as a moneyed crowd that does good would be too boring for a book or movie. However, the story takes the cliche rules and creates a knife with which to stab each character in the heart and punish them for their aimless lifestyle.But what a knife and so well done. Naturally, the ultimate act is murder and some may say, even true love lost. Now the story gets real interesting.<br />Will Mat be found out? Did the rich brats really need to trade a boring Park Avenue for this? In the end, the movie says that the idle rich are doomed. Meanwhile, one enjoys the great costumes, including the small hats, the beautiful landscapes, BCBG lifestyles, and the feeling that perhaps we wish we could have had this lifestyle. But be careful, don't wish too strongly.
B009UX2YAC|5|it is the best game ever it has cool powerups and graphics it is just amazing. i play it all day longed
B000HL09MG|4|The movie was received quickly and was packaged well.  It was a good movie and can be viewed by the whole family. Thanks, Bobby J. Dillard.
B000VYNYN0|2|This is the kind of movie we used to go to the drive in to see because we weren't there to see a movie and didn't care how good, or bad, it was.
B00J8CGU64|3|Movie is pretty wild and was a little too long, 3 hours, but the acting is excellent.  Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorites and always delivers an excellent and believable performance.
B00BI73CVI|5|Awesome!
B00BFUUMO8|5|Best game of the year
0761169431|5|This was clearly a favorite under the tree....the boys (ages 8 and 13) loved it and enjoyed learning to fold and create with the patterned papers.  I definitely would recommend if you want a gift that grabs the attention and then holds that attention while creativity takes over.
B006KX3GXO|2|Not what I expected...Ok app. A bit involved. Doesn't meet my needs at this time. Maybe later on it will.
B00AREIAI8|5|I have had this app for a few months, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves horses.  It might not be the real thing, but it is still fun.
B0000TB01Y|5|Buying the original Broadway cast recording after watching the show was<br />wonderful. This especially since most of the show is in this CD. It's almost<br />like experiencing the show over and over again when I listen to it. It's the best!<br />Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are awesome!
B009UWYFFK|4|It's a Halloween movie or just a good animation for kids. Not real scary except for the zombie part which is pretty short and you can tell something is odd about them,  Music is nice and the characters are fun.
B003U4ZQUM|5|I have really enjoyed Lost!  I have to admit, at times I was lost! Lol! In Season 5, it all starts to make sense.<br />I'm gonna miss my family when it ends in season 6!!!!!!! ( sniff, sniff)
B008XNZMOU|5|I am a huge Taylor Swift fan and I love her work, but she has outdone herself on this one!  Same great heartfelt and original songs that you'd expect from her!
B001EN71CW|5|What is not to love about this series.
B00F35B8F8|2|I love the Star Trek franchise and was disappointed in how this one lacked creativity, acting was average and storyline wasn't interesting enough to se a sequel.
B00E8KLWB4|4|definitely a good game to pass the time with when you're bored and can not fall asleep at night like now
B000JMKNV0|5|loved this book!  I read this book in about 4 days which is really fast for me.  It kept me wondering up until the last few pages how the story was going to turn out.
B00008NGHI|5|For the audiophiles: Among my favorite SACD's.  I listen to the SACD stereo layer on a quality headphone rig, and this recording is very-well done, clear, natural, balanced, and very well-mixed.  In fact, I prefer it to her SACD 'New Favorite', both in performance and recording playback.  The performance, mixing, and recording quality is among the best of live albums that I've heard, and is better than most of the studio recordings I own.  Worthy of the SACD format, and of high-quality playback hardware.  A good disc for demonstrating your system.  Note: I have not listened to the 5.1 layer. <br /> <br />For the Music Lovers: This album really grew on me quickly and is now one of my favorite albums.  Alison's vocal abilities are stunning; her abilities are exemplified even more clearly when you consider that this is a live album.  bluegrass/country music collector or not, anyone willing to appreciate the top offerings in a genre will likely enjoy this album.  It would be hard to not acknowledge the mastery of musicianship, vocals, and selection of songs.
B0002O7XWC|4|I got this item because I loved the movie. Worth keeping to see over and over again.  I got good service and the item came in the shape it was to be in, ( NEW ).
B00BSBR9N6|5|I enjoyed this book. Different than what I usually read. some interesting turn of events. It is a book I will share and read again.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Anyone should definitely get this outstanding book by an excellent author, Suzanne Collins. It has everything a reader wants and so much more. So if you are considering getting Mockingjay and reading the other books in the Hunger Games series ( The Hunger Games and Catching Fire) you absolutely, positively, SHOULD!
B00CYFGCOW|5|My daughter loves it. She had waited so long for Christmas and it was a huge hit. Very soft and cuddly.
0307719219|5|A real world view of everything.  Also read their Blog.  Best way to look at any form of progress or development anywhere; can even use it in business or in education and label the extractive inhibitors or the facilitative enablers...
B008JFUQ16|5|I loved this movie! Very heartwarming! It is amazing how they can make cartoon characters seem so real. It was cute how the girls grew up and Gru became a great father.
B000002MIB|3|The mixing is terrible (the cymbals are way too high, and the only time Eddie's guitar is clear is &quot;316&quot;), the tracklist is so biased it's not even funny (these guys had a singer called David Lee Roth??), but at least the performances are tight, if unremarkable. The guitar solos are really fleshed out and fired up by Eddie, but once again, the mixing renders them too quiet. The bass and drum solos are masturbatory and unnecessary, and the 10 out of 11 songs from &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; would have been better served to showcase some classics from the DLR era. A quaint reminder of Van Halen's live skills, but how about some more DLR songs? Or better yet, a classic live album from that era?
0743298020|2|I was sadly disappointed in this book.  I all but sat at the store awaiting its arrival and I'm a huge fan of classic literature and love a great story.  The first few pages held promise (reminding me a lot of Shadow of the Wind - which I absolutely loved).  The hype about this book was huge, but the reality lackluster.  The writing style and form is excellent, so no qualms there.  The author just needs a better story to display her talents.  The plot fizzles to the ridiculous with the ending being untenable, patchy and just, uh, downright silly.  I just didn't buy it at all (won't divulge the \\"spoiler\\").  I had a very hard time caring one iota for Vida Winter, she is just patently unlikeable (as are her parents).  While conflict in a character is great, you have to at least care somewhat about them.  I also found the main character rather ho hum.  Overall, disappointing.
B00I75EROU|4|Good suspense--good character deveopment
B00BP4Z8XY|5|My 9-year old son loved it and keeps asking to watch it again. Surprisingly I enjoyed it too.
0446525537|1|I had been waiting with bated breath for Mr. Sparks to write another book. After The Notebook and Message In a Bottle, my hopes for another great  read, I thought, would be worth the wait. Not. I read it one sitting and  found it to be very predictable and not funny or sad at all due to the  pedictability. After his first two top notch books,I expected much more  then he delivered.
B00AFQC4QC|5|A dark story about what happened to ordinary people in Czechoslovakia during the second world war. A young girl of Jewish descent marries a German expatriate shortly before the war and as was the way in those days, moves in with his family. As their world descends into the madness of that particular war we track the decisions of all the members of both their families and the effect they had on the people around them.<br /><br />If I had not seen documentaries showing evidence of what happened in Europe at that time I would not have been able to believe half of what happened in this story. As time passes my brain wants to drift into believing that a hand-full of evil people managed to gain power over the rest and force them to do terrible things for fear of reprisal upon their own families. After all what idiot, especially if they were educated, would believe all the Nazi propaganda about Jews having defective genes and carrying diseases, and how could ordinary people stand by and watch as tens of thousands of people were deported to work camps knowing how harsh the conditions were. But of course, at the time, they did believe it and they did stand by, and worst of all, some of them used this threat to gain leverage over the remaining Jews or to allay their own feeling of inferiority.<br /><br />The way Christoph Fischer drip feeds statistics into the story is a gentle reminder that unimaginable acts of cruelty really happened and the stakes are terrifyingly high. What made them even higher for me was that my world war studies had focused on France and Germany and a smattering of Poland and I had almost no knowledge of what happened politically in Czechoslovakia so I had no idea what was going to happen next. Which of the protagonist should flee? They were not obviously Jewish and could exist under the radar, but for how long? The rules got incrementally severe. How bad would it get?  Where could they go? What happens when a young Jew is conscripted into the army? How long can he last before someone realizes? Who will betray any of them on a spiteful whim?<br /><br />A harrowing read, but one I genuinely stayed up all night reading because I just had to know what happened in the end. Plus I am a lot more grateful for my so so life this morning.w long can he last before someone realizes? Who will betray any of them on a spiteful whim?<br /><br />A harrowing read, but one I genuinely stayed up all night reading because I just had to know what happened in the end. Plus I am a lot more grateful for my so so life this morning.
B00992CF6W|4|It was cool but I wish managing added more stuff from minecraft today. There is so little stuff from computer minecraft that it is not as fun. But still a good start.
B005Y423ZC|5|Better than her CD.
B005K17RU0|5|This is a great app. It's reliable, loads fast, and User friendly. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a quick way to check the weather.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|It started off slow but turned into a really interesting book. They tied the characters together so well that it kept your attention. Its a very good book. It was hard to put it down each night.
B00506NRBS|5|I was having a grumpy day, but spent the evening reading this book. It was a quick, wonderful read, with a treasure at the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who runs a business, works as a freelancer, or has a dream. Humans can learn so much from Derek. A huge thanks to Seth Godin for recommending it yesterday.
B00DRPVE3M|1|I would not suggest that you get this app!!!!!!!!! The game loses connection with the server right in the middle of a game! Especially, when you are 1 card away from winning. Don't just take my advice. Go to Gameloft.com &amp; read all about it for yourself! I can't believe that the developer can take such a good childhood game and cause you soooooooooo much aggravation!!!!! This game has mad me soooo ill at times, I have wanted to throw my Kindle out the window, knowing full well, it isn't my Kindle's fault!!! Maybe, if I spent the large amounts of $ that is required to be a VIP &amp; to buy coins, tokens &amp; boosts, the game might work better. But judging what I have read at the Gameloft Forum, I doubt it!!!!
B009NH6JRE|5|I've been watching this since Season 1. It's a great show with awesome characters. Every episode will keep you on your feet.and wanting more. I own all 3 seasons on BluRay and will continue to buy them as they come on.
B00004X01U|4|Madonna, Madonna, Madonna, no name can be sound so good. Her carrer is very astonishing but I think in this album something has been missed. I really enjoy Ray Of Light this album has blurred all the edges of pop, techno, trance and spiritual songs. BedTime Story was sweet lullababy and Time to Remember was a gift for lovers. Even in EROTICA a breaktrought performance with an bomb book was more powerful than MUSIC. I don't know because her voice became so good after EVITA and when you listen Imaculate Collection and compare with both Ray of Light and Music we have a sight that somebody work so hard. She continues as a DIVA but I think W.Orbit's works made her best and let her soul and voice shine. If you are a unconditional Madonna fan as I'm buy it but doesn't have great expectation because you can also be frustrated. Afterwards, GONE, MUSIC and What if feels like a girl are the best tracks NOBODY'S PERFECT,AMAZING,RUNAWAY LOVER are also good and other tracks for me are disposable. I'd prefer imagine that her new work after music might be as Ray of Light was for me. We don't need a Ray of Light II but Music would be more cool and not cooling as it was for me.
B009G41CG2|5|This is a fun game to play... It is one of the games I play the most when I'm on.

B00KA87GCW|4|Fun. Interesting
B004GKMV3Y|3|I've read a lot of Sophie's books and have loved them & fallen deeply engrossed in the characters b<br />This book - the Wedding Girl - wasn't as good to read. The storyline was there and there was intrigue but all in the last third if the book. Not much happened in the first 2 thirds. You knew the characters but it didn't have that feeling of wanting to know more and see what happened to the characters when it finished.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Gorgeously written, and characters that are heartbreakingly real.  I loved the entire novel, didn't want it to end.  The story offered so much insight into a horrifying time in our history.
B00LP9E79U|4|Worst post-apocalyptic premise ever yet a pretty good movie. Gotta see it.
B0000024JN|5|listen to licensed to ill and...party! there are lots of party classics on this album.(you've gotta)fight for your right (to party),brass monkey,no sleep 'til brooklyn,girls,hlod it now hit it,she's crafty,and time to get ill still sound good and funny today. so check out this album,party,and laugh. ed wilson

B003YL4LYI|5|I started with the HBO series & now I can't wait for the next book!  I love the literary bravery that Martin shows; any character can be killed off at any time!  It makes for a book that keeps you on your toes.<br />Loved it!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I LOVE THIS GAME! It takes a lot of skill and practice. You should get it. This game is FREE and fun for all ages!
B00KMX5V8G|1|I love this game but every time it updates it has one problem after another I end up deleting the game and loading over and over until it lets me play again and I can play until the next update and trouble again
B00J11U4J6|5|Great Seller !! Everything as mentioned and in great condition!! Thank you !!!
B0032CVAQQ|5|This book should be given to anyone applying for a marriage license...preferably state mandatory... but definitely a great wedding gift! It pinpoints the fundamental principles of marital cohabitation, which are lacking in many relationships.  I will definitely be practicing my language skills......maybe he should work with Rosetta Stone on a revolutionary love language.  Read this book, make a list, fill up a calendar and watch it grow... water and sunlight are preferred also.
B0055PGUYU|5|I listened to the Power of Habit on audiobook from Audible and thought it was a great book. Habits are a incredible force and this book gives examples for individuals, businesses, and large organizations. Powerful and useful book.
B00006IU73|4|It's an immutable fact of life that nothing is ever as good as the hype. Porcupine Tree has been hyped as the next big progressive rock band, and In Absentia is often touted as the best album of 2002. Suffice it to say that I bought this album with high expectations, and while I wasn't disappointed, I think it's fair to say that this is a good album - but not a great one.<br />First of all, I take issue with the label that this is progressive rock music. Porcupine Tree is more of a hybrid of progressive and alternative rock - think Spock's Beard meets Radiohead. The result is music full of beautiful vocal harmonies and subtle but luscious keyboards (love those Mellotrons) packaged in songs that adhere to standard time signatures and lengths. It's a winning combination, made all the better by Steve Wilson's impressive talent for writing lyrics and melodies that evoke genuine feeling. I challenge anyone to listen to &quot;Heart Attack In A Lay-By&quot; and not be moved. <br />Still, as a listener who enjoys ambitious music, I found myself longing for more. Wilson and company are competent musicians, but Roine Stolt or Rick Wakeman they are not. A little more experimentation and a little less clinging to alt rock cliches would have made this album stronger for me. <br />In Absentia will please or displease you depending on your expectations. Come expecting true progressive rock and you'll be disappointed. For those willing to try a scaled down progressive sound, however, the beautiful and honest songs on this disc will be a wonderful surprise.
B004Y1WCDE|5|I am sorry I don't know what this is so I can't rate it.
B00003CWPR|4|I have no intention of plowing my way through all the reviews of \\"Eyes\\" to see if anyone caught the De Sade element in this movie.  The scene of the so-called orgy is in fact a literal representation of the high-literary sex scenes in the novels of the late-18th-century novelist Marquis De Sade.  These scenes occur in all versions of \\"Justine\\" as well as in that novel's \\"twin\\" namely \\"Juliette.\\"  A catalog of Sade's personalized deliberate insult delivered to religious believers and 18th-century worshippers of \\"reason\\" alike would include the following list, all of which items appear in \\"Eyes\\":    (1) a mimicking of a religious edifice, normally a monastery of monks.  Here, the monastery fuses with another element in Sade, namely, the isolated fortified castle.  (2) monks who systematically assault all Christian religious values.  The red-cloaked \\"monk\\" who wields a incense censor (drawn from Roman Catholic religious ceremonies) which is juxtaposed against the near-naked females who form a kind of religious circle around him.  (3) The black cloaks worn the \\"watchers\\"--lots of voyeurism in this sexualized religious ceremony, including those figures who were brought in supposedly to mask the sex scenes--are in fact direct reference to the monk's robe worn by Sade's libidinous monks.  (4) Hints a torture practice--something much more explicit in Sade's fictions--as well as of some mysterious power that can reach outside the monastery/fortress and attack enemies on the outside: a plot factor realized in the incompletely developed harrowing of Dr. Hartford after the ceremony.    All these elements are very \\"literary\\" in the sense of \\"literary allusion\\" to be accidental on Kubrick's part.  Whatever \\"moral\\" theme the movie possesses or pretends to (and it does this sporadically throughout the film), it is clear that Kubrick was trying to bring an updated of a Sadian (and \\"sadistic\\" if you will) version of how late 18th-century \\"rationalist\\" France's literary world was deep-sixed by its own involvement in the French Revolution.  De Sade himself made up a part of this revolution until finally imprisoned for life by Napoleon, but much of his work is satirical in the mainstream tradition of 18th-Century French and English satire.    One of the things Kubrick--for whatever thematic issues he wanted to hawk abroad publcly--was doing was mimicking the view of \\"ordinary\\" people about the absoluteness of the separation between human holiness and human depravity.  Sade scholarship and literary analysis has advanced sufficiently far today for us to recognize that much of his \\"blasphemy\\" is a mirror-image presented to the sentimentalist believer in the goodness of human nature.  For Sade, such a simplicity is mirrored back to the sentimental reader in his rendering of a world consisting of nothing but villains and innocent victims.  Dr. Hartford gets a whiff of this dialectic and then retreats back into his marriage.
B0037RDPEG|1|This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read.  So badly written I just wanted to take my editor's pencil to it or re-write it. Preachy tone, boring prose.<br />Someone told me that it would be a good book to read while I was in Ubud.  The only good thing to do with this book in Ubud was to throw it into the ravine of the Monkey Forest.
B002FRNCG0|5|I really like this band.I picked this cd up on a whim the other day at the music store.I had only hard a few songs from them off of their other cd RIOT, and decided to give 'em a listen.I am very impressed with Paramore.This chick has an awesome voice,no cheesy lyrics here!I am deffinately a fan of this band.I will suggest this band to anybody
B0076DCT2G|5|Excellent read.  Couldn't put it down.  Chapter after chapter flew by.  Didn't like that the story ended, so went online looking for a sequel.
B00PSLQYWE|5|My favorite series!
B002IFT1ZA|5|I read the books first.  This series does the books justice.
B00B2V66VS|5|Really addicting.Even more so than the original. I've lost my wife, kids, and job thanks to the countless hours lost to TR2. Also, drugs.
B003TSEEDY|5|A true twisted and envied book I now praise because of its excellence. Beautiful book great read to anyone I promise you.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Pays homage to previous Kahn story without over doing it.  Many great special effects, and good actors.  Very enjoyable movie.
B002XTBEDI|5|I can't say enough about British drama.  They have it nailed.  Cranford, in my opinion, is a masterpiece of entertainment.  I have watched this DVD, so many times and have enjoyed the characters in their small community of Cranford.  Reminds me of the town in which I grew up, where all the neighbors knew what was going on in everyone's life, and gossiped, but not in a mean spirited way. The story centers around two spinsters sisters, Deborah (played by Eileen Atkins) and Mary (played by Judy Dench) in 1842.  The elder sister, Deborah, is the epitome of correctness. Her sister, Mary, is not so rigid in social correctness and a little softer in her demeanor. This is not to be missed............I recommend it, Highly.
B000OCXMAE|2|I have most of the lp albums. The first two albums, hybrid theory collision course. I even have the fort minor album and mixtape. Their ability to audiolize (yes i made that word up) feelings into sounds is uncanny. And the blend of metal, rock and hip hop filled a gaping void in music. Fear, anger, self loathing, loneliness, dissappointment turned into words and music. Good stuff. In their latest release, they have decided to audiolize the feeling of sleepiness. What a dissappointment. And whoever thinks limiting Mike Shinoda's rap lyrics to two songs is maturation needs to take some viagra and check their pulse. Who cares if you are making valid points regarding this unnecessary and immoral war and corrupt administration if you are singing me to sleep when you do it. (I am going to write my congressman as soon as i wake up!...zzzz). If they wrote 50 songs for this album why not include 2 or 3 more for those who didn't want to see the band \\"mature\\" from hard rockers to james taylor overnight (I swear he's singing background on \\"In Between). I gave the album two stars for \\"Hands Held High\\" which I could listen two about 50 times in a row and for about 4 other songs which are pretty good including What I've Done and Bleed it out and Leave Out All the Rest. Definetly not the worst album of the year but equally definitely not the best. Too bad. I picked this album up on the first day without previewing or checking for reviews. I won't do that for the next album.
0790729989|5|Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller easily ranks as one of the decade's most frightening and suspenseful films. Set in a hellish vision of New York, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain which can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) into moving into the big city so that he could tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent Gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for Greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about Lust, Sloth, Pride, Wrath, and Envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. Fincher's deadly serious film benefits from wonderfully moody photography by Darius Khondji and a tension-filled script by Andrew Kevin Walker. The nauseatingly vivid special effects (particularly the remarkable Sloth murder) are among the most effective ever done by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). Seven, however, really belongs to Morgan Freeman, who turns in the best performance of his career as Somerset, whose every word and expression gives credence to the theory that once a man looks into the abyss for too long, it starts to look back at him. R. Lee Ermey, Richard Roundtree, and Kevin Spacey co-star in this haunting, atmospheric masterpiece.
B003FXXNH6|5|Great movie.
B008XG1X18|5|I put off using pinterest for a long time. Finally caved when it became an app that I was able to use on my Kindle. Love this app! I haven't had a whole lot of problems with it. I think when it first came out a few bugs loading but it's been awhile since I've had that issue. And it does seem to load a bit slow.... Other than that it's a great app.
B009YP9L7U|4|I chose this book because it looked interesting and I wasn't disappointed.  I would recommend this book to anyone who liked to laugh and cry all at once.
B007IXWL2C|5|This is a good continuation of the book and was a good mindless read.  I recommend it to anyone that wants something easy to ready
B005HSL626|5|I've had to settle for &#34;Fruit Slice&#34; on my phone. I am so happy to be able to get &#34;FRUIT NINJA&#34; again!
B000008L90|5|<br />This is one of Donna Summer's less &quot;commercial&quot; albums. It is not one of her best sellers but definitely worth looking for. <br />Released on the Geffen label in the mid-80's, Donna makes a dramatic departure from her trademark &quot;disco&quot; days at Casablanca and goes for a fresh new sound. It includes songs that showcase her vocal ability like &quot;It's Not the Way&quot;, &quot;Oh Billy Please&quot; and &quot;Forgive Me&quot;, for which she won a Grammy (Inspirational). My favorites are &quot;I'm Free&quot; and &quot;Maybe It's Over&quot;. The album has a sound that is distinctively 80's but at the same time is very original.<br />It is rumored among Donna fans that this album is one of her favorites. There are many rarities associated with this album such as extended versions, special mixes and unreleased songs.<br />If you are looking for standard Donna songs, I recommend the &quot;Anthology&quot; or &quot;Journey&quot; compilations, however, if you are looking to explore a different side of Donna, this album has a few songs that are well worth looking for.
B00FATEJYE|5|I love this game. I am on it all the time. It is a MUST GET! Graphics are amazing as are the special moves. Everyone can play.
B00005OM4N|3|Everyone is slaming Britney about her lastest C.D. A lot of her songs go along with the same kind of beat, which is the only down side I can see. The only song without a lot of bass is \\" I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", which is a beautiful song I may add. Her C.D. is just showing that she's done with growing up; she's not 16 anymore. She should have put another song with a soft tone to make it more well rounded. \\"I'm A Slave For You,\\" is a song that stands out. A lot of artists' music is really similar, but this song has its own style. If you think Britney Spears has gross lyrics, then you obviously haven't listened to Destiny's Child or Pink. \\"Bombastic Love\\" has a great beginning ping, and \\"Overprotected\\" has lyrics that hook you. The C.D. isn't as good as her earlier ones, but it is still a good buy. The only problem with it is that the bass is a little overcoming.
0743298039|5|That's probably the longest title I've ever written for a review, but I think it sums up this book (and review) rather well. \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is this interesting, creepy, almost ghost story but real, Gothic-style (as everyone is so quick to call it) book that glides along smoothly (and a tad bit slowly, because of the elegance) and will provide readers with a fascinating tale. Whew. A lot of words.<br /><br />What's not to like? Some readers may be put off by the slow feel. Stories within stories written eloquently and beautifully that build up slowly and carefully to an ultimate point may not be for all. One needs a certain level of appreciation for the classics (such as \\"Jane Eyre\\", one of the themes in this book) and the ability to read books that believe in telling the whole story in order to like this book. But for those who do, it's so easy to fall in love.<br /><br />I liked \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" quite a bit. I found the plot twists intriguing and the writing clear and well done. I, interestingly enough, was not bored by the book at all, and in fact could not put it down. I see how others might not like this book, with the air of mystery, the occasional disturbing parts (creepy or just frightening), and the overall old-fashioned air, but on the whole the book impresses. It's just kind of cool and yes - I enjoyed reading it. It's a good book.<br /><br />It's not a book for all, but it's a pretty solid, comfortable recommendation to those who think an interesting, dark tale will be perfect for the night.
B000VNMMR0|1|Okay, I know I'm in the very small minority, but this movie was bad. First lesson in story telling; your audience has to care about the characters. Secondly; the story has to be based in reality (unless it's SciFi).<br />This movie takes about two seconds to develop any character lines. The plot is so absurd and far fetched as to be funny. Let's see; the NYPD police officer goes over to Camden, New York to take in a hacker for questioning (without a warrant or probable cause). Apparently Camden has no police force, or county or state police, and the NYPD allows it's officers to drive some 5 hours out of the city outside their jurisdiction on something that doesn't concern them (as far as prosecution is concerned).<br />Now the NYPD officer (Bruce Willis) gets into a extensive gun battle; the apartment where the hacker lives is blown up, numerous people are killed, the apartment building is shot full of holes, but hey, apparently nobody calls police/fire/rescue, and Willis just drives away. I guess checking for anyone else being injured or calling the FD because the building is on fire would just slow the action.<br />Then there's driving an SUV up a parking ramp and thru a glass window into the \\"secure\\" computer control room. Bad building design and security; having the parking ramp and your secure areas only divided by a glass partition. Next you run down the female bad guy with the suv at about 40mph, but wait, she doesn't even get one injury! And the list goes on.<br />This movie is just a bunch of unbelievable special effects and stunts with a terrible story line that was put there as an afterthought.<br />If you like special effects and stunts, see this movie, but check your brain at the door.
0553386794|5|This is a great book with a story that keeps you guessing.  It kept my interest from beginning to end, and at moments I debated whether this might someday trump Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The answer though is no.  Might be a distant second place, but here's the deal --<br /><br />Martin is a magician with his pen.  He develops a character like no one, including Tolkien.  You get to know the 100th most important character in the book as if he were a close friend (or enemy).  That's how good the character development is.  But plot?  What plot?  There are themes.  There are hints that some plot or sub-plot might soon be revealed.  But there is no true plot to this book.  And that's what makes GRRM a magician.  He is so good at telling a story by developing characters that you never realize there's no real point to the story.  It just goes on and on until you're left lusting for the next book...
B00HZ48QUA|4|Cast was great, story pretty good, but pretty predictable.  I could watch it again, entertaining movie, and I usually can't watch a movie twice.
B009DP9D6A|5|What more can I say ?  Good album, great for the gym.. My fav being Professional Griefers! I got the MP3 Album but it's available with AutoRip (Meaning you buy the CD and you get the MP3 download too)
1101946342|3|As usual, the author is a poor writer, but the content was fun and I look forward to the same treatment for the next 2 &#34;Grey&#34; books
B004UPALT6|5|Evening, afternoon, morning, mid of the night~ Evil dead is just an awesome film,  Love to watch this film on a plane ,train, car home, this one goes far!  Classic!
B00H5KRPD8|5|I liked the 1st season of AHS. I thought some of it was a bit corny, but, all in all it was a pretty good show. Done well. With a pretty original idea(how hard are those to come by these days!?!?!?). Macabre as !@#$! Asylum... is even BETTER!!! From the very 1st episode. It grabs you and DOESN'T let go! I don't really watch TV. And I LOVED AHS Asylum. This season is INSANE(pun intended...)! I love all the twists and turns. And the things you just NEVER saw coming! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B009UX2YAC|5|I like this game it was fun when you play with all these themes.<br />And I like all the twists and turns
B004FOA84A|4|at first it was easy ablnd as the story thickens it gets harder but way may creative. I love the entire thing. totally worth the money and you should get it!!!:)
B00881VLCE|5|If you can't go there, you sure can in these picture puzzles.  The pictures are beautiful, fun and to start free.
B00003CXDG|2|This movie does not compare with it's predecessor, the plot is very cheesy, and the love scenes even cheesier (especially that terrible car twirling scene).  The action sequences are nice and tight, but that is all that John Woo knows how to do well.  The entire movie is laid out, and predictable;  which on the other hand, being what made the first one so good (all the back and forth temporal activity, much like a Pulp Fiction style).  Worst of all, this movie has the feel that is was just made to make money, and boost Tom Cruises ego, stardom, and bank account.
B005HSG3TC|4|Got this for another great grandchild..Her mom likes the weight of it...not too heavy for child...has a cover as well and a good elastic band to hold together when closed. Kindle fit well and stays in. would recommend
0143124544|5|There is nothing worse than a spoiler review.  Nobody needs a summary of the book they are about to read.  That said, this book is wonderful.  I haven't been this moved in a very long time.  Read it!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Not quite Pride and Prejudice, but still a great show that is more addictive every time I watch it. Watched all 3 seasons in a week!
B000N6TYLW|4|Obviously a \\"must-have\\" for all Gilmore Fans.  The DVD set is great.  The bonus material has become pretty scarce.  There's not much of any substance there.  Don't let that stop you from getting the DVDs.  I rewatched the entire 7 seasons over the summer and fall...and this was a great ending to a great series.
B0000AQS0F|5|Great Series!
B008JFUUQ2|5|good
B007ZGO7EM|5|I have been looking for a calculator and this one has been great for what I need so thank you.
B00B5AAW52|5|Arrived quickly and so far all dvd's in tact. Lots of series info inside the dvd cases. Great buy.
B0007TKNII|5|Wonderful film! My family absolutely loved this one and will be watched many more times.
1564148793|5|I enjoyed this book. Jason Miller lives in the real world, a world where a good deed and intention is often not enough to keep one from harm. In his book he describes many techniques from various well researched and cited sources ranging from classic to modern magickal thought and theory.<br />The techniques presented are easy to understand and are written in a conversational tone. His style of magick is eclectic to the point of almost being Chaos inspired. I recognized many of the sources he cited and was introduced to new ways of thought on protection and reversal magicks.<br />Though he works primarily with Hekate the rituals presented are easily adapted to your own needs and trads. I can hardly wait to see his next book as hinted in this one.<br />My favorite quote from this book is: \\"Okay, so it's a comic book series. If  you can't get around that, then you won't understand Chaos Magick.\\"<br />I highly recommend this book to practitioner who wants a thorough investigation into a technique that has been largely untouched many occult writers.
B00FEX2ZFG|5|I don't have a lot of extra money to spend going to the movies like I used to, so a trailer really has to catch my eye if I am going to spend my money.    The Conjuring's trailer sure as heck caught my eye, especially when it said \\"based on a true story\\".  Now, those four words could mean quite a few things, so I did a bit of research and found out just how TRUE this story was.  HOLY MOLY was I in for a shock!  The eldest daughter of the Perron family was open about her experiences and is even writing a trilogy.  On her website she has an FAQ section.  The answer to the Question \\"Is the Conjuring exactly how it happened? Is it true?\\"  the answer is    \\"In Andrea's words, \\"[The Conjuring] is essentially true. There are elements of fiction in it; however - for the most part - in broad, sweeping strokes, it captures the true elements of what we endured for ten years in this farmhouse.\\" (from an interview with CBS This Morning on July 27, 2013)\\"    The link to her website is:  [...]    You can also google her, Angela Perron.
B004ZMWUCU|5|This book even though a fiction those nuns even in my young life were evil. They were so bitter and did not like happy kids
0805017305|5|my father was born in Deadwood, SD and my great grandfather sat on the commission which promised the black hills &quot;forever&quot; to the sioux.  this book was an eye opener and when we were last in South Dakota, we took  the road to Pine Ridge and we stopped to look at the massacre site and at  the lonely and poignant monument at the mass grave.  it was the first time  i have perceived the enormous insult that mt rushmore must be to the sioux.   there were no tourists, no t-shirt stands, the place is as it was--we were  so moved by the words on the monument, we wept.  more americans should read  this book and visit this haunting place.
B00006M183|1|its pretty amazing how one of the worst musical failures in modern times gets a better review rating then much much better albums.Guess Pearl Jam fans are very easy to please.A musical yawn,cy and belch and 5 stars!    I remember that this album had like an 80 percent dip in sales in its second week.It was from people like me warning our friends (and enemies) not to get this album.    there are so many things wrong with this album that its hard to know where to begin.Vedder sounds like Elvis in his fat period The band sounds like the Elvis band during the fat period.Playing thous instruments half asleep dreaming of  vacations.    the beats are as boring as the band's new haircuts.And what happened to simple choruses?You know \\"Im Still Alive\\" and \\"Jeremy spoke in class today\\".    the only songs I remember from this album are \\"I am Mine\\" and \\"Loveboat Captain\\".One of which actually quotes the Beatles.Yeah,\\"All you need is love\\" is deep,dudes.    the others in need of lyrical rewrites,a much tighter band sound,and atleast some memorable hooks.    after Riot Act ,the band was all out of even lame ideas.Releasing various compilations to little interest.    now the biggest band of 1992 is signed to an indie label and still working on a new album.
B002PMV9FG|5|One of my favorites in the tale of Harry Potter and his friends and foes. This sets things up for the final film(s). In the tradition of the other Potter films, it has drama, excitement, joy and sorrow.

B00BHU9CCO|5|Its fun and scary all at once for a little one. How fun……….
B005ZOBNOI|4|This was a great book.  I definitely needed a box of tissues while I was reading.  Some of the language was difficult to understand and I had to reread a few times.
B008JGSM6G|4|i thhink tjat this game is fun a nice brain game to pass the time  but it can get practically impossible but give it a try
B00LP1MVSW|4|Thursday's. Puts u. In t the middle of sins of season. Even with slow WiFi this game fun and. Unbelievable graphics, gun a little strange to use but once you figure. Out how. A gun. All guns work th e same way
B0083P1QUM|5|I was not disappointed! Each Scarpetta novel has proven worthy and The Bone Bed is no exception. This novel had me on the edge of my seat and left me speechless. Patricia Cornwell's writing above her competition and puts her on top! Love The Bone Bed and look forward to her next Scarpetta novel.
B00P7PK6JS|5|My entire family likes this one, such great effects for keeping the magic alive for girls (ages 5 & 8).
B00KK0PICK|5|This is a reader-friendly book.  I donated half of my clothes in my closet and it felt so good and was so easy.
B00H7Y9CKG|5|Really fun and cool game
B00AGOGOLE|5|I love this app because in kindle fire there is no video and this is just perfect. You should definitely get this.
0440178002|5|Perhaps the greatest historical fiction book ever.  My words can not adequately describe the world you will be emmersed in when reading this book.  There is intrigue,love, jealousy and mystery in this medieval Japanese epic.  The plot is never dull and constantly moving.  You will begin to feel that you are living the story rather than reading it.  When you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|3|Super for kids!! Nice graphics, cute sound and animation. Good learning tool for the little ones.
B00AB0Z88S|5|YES YES YES!
B007KZY1YY|3|As with the first book, very unimpressed, the writing style let down what could have been a very spicy read.
0451529065|5|I re-read On the Origin about a year ago. In the book, Darwin discusses the fact that humans are causing other animals to change, and he talks about the many different breeds (or \\"races\\", as he calls them) of domesticated pigeons that breeders were able to create (or design) through selective breeding. Darwin knew that all these breeds of pigeons descended from a single shared ancestor - the rock pigeon. He knew that pigeon breeders were able to design new breeds of pigeons, specifically adapted to various tasks, by artificially selecting and preserving in future generations the traits they favored in each new breed.<br /><br />Darwin's big idea was the realization that the same thing happens in nature. He recognized that the offspring of any species are born with different traits (variation), and that not all of these offspring survive to pass on their particular traits to future generations. Therefore, the traits that don't help an offspring survive are lost with the dead offspring, while the traits that advance survival are automatically passed on to the next generation when the successful offspring reproduces.<br /><br />As the successful traits accumulate over many generations, they will eventually dominate the entire population, giving rise to new species. Darwin called this \\"natural selection.\\" He discovered that it's responsible for adaptation, and ultimately all biological diversity on this planet.<br /><br />Having said that, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" is badly dated. Much of it is wrong, and turns into a frustrating read, as Darwin tries desperately to describe the mechanism behind variation without understanding genetics.<br /><br />The few things that are correct (basically, Darwin's description of natural selection), can be summarized in three or four paragraphs. Unless you long for nostalgia, there's no reason that this book should be on your reading list. If you want to learn something new about evolution, read Neil Shubin's [[ASIN:0307277453 Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (Vintage)]] or Jerry Coyne's [[ASIN:B002ZNJWJU Why Evolution Is True]] instead.
B00025ETIW|5|These guys are some of the more intelligent and talented bands in the emo scene. The vocalist of this band isn't imitating anyone, he is just really good at what he does. This was their breakout album and for good reason.
B00IS87HYI|5|Challenging
B00F87ZUYG|5|Totally hooked ! Never disappoints. Can't find to many more shows that can even compare to how good TWD is.
B00EMXBDMA|5|That's this book (except replace the island with Mars and for the main character MacGyver and Wade have to somehow have a love child bearing both of their strongest characteristics).<br />And that's it but that's saying a lot.<br />This book has the added benefit of bringing back the energy and excitement of the space race to the moon except this time the entire population of our planet (technically the entire populations of 2 planets) are all on the same team.<br />Finally, I'm thrilled it's being made into s move but glad I read the book first.
B00MLY8FIW|5|Heartbreaking, but beautifully done.
B00B2V66VS|5|My daughter wanted me to download this app for her so I did. Now we both play it all the time. It's very addicting!
B00992CF6W|5|I think that this game is awesome.I like captain  sparkles is cool. I want to play it for the rest of my life.
0060581808|5|This is a series I have grown up reading, and now, well into my 30s, I'm still reading. I love the story, and the descriptive writing, that takes you back to a simpler time. It goes into detail of how things were done before the technology of today. Little House in the Big Woods is an incredible introduction to the series. I just can't wait until I have little grandkids to read it to. ... oh.wait. ... yes, yes I can. I'll just keep reading it to myself for another 15 years before that happens :)
B009Y7YC2M|1|Can't tell the difference between the free app or the paid app disappointed.
B0073PZIYI|1|Worst acting
B00DPM7TIG|5|Mystical and almost magical in the improbable connecting of characters on all the dimensions that matter...and interweaving the time of war with literature, science and human limitations..
B00A8ECU24|5|Really Cute, fun to play, ive always been a fan of my little pony so i had to try it, its hard to keep money with the goals.
B00KMXQJ0A|5|I love this show!!!  Thank you for this item.  Shipping was great and fast.  Item was described well.  Thank you
B00AQ3K8IU|2|Again, hoping for better characters instead of control freaks who have a predictable approach to the other character.  Nothing like 50 Shades of Gray
B000RJO578|5|This movie is brilliant.  The attention to detail in every scene for comedic value is superb.  The editor is the BEST editor Ive ever come across, and I can say this by having watched the deleted scenes.  If you enjoy The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy, or Shawn of the Dead...this movie has many of the same actors.  The DVD extras are fabulous, you even get to see the flip picture cartoon on the other side of the notebook from the traffic violation scene.
B008KS4DR0|4|This is a great little movie. Simple in premise, with a small twist at the end, that's fun to sit through again and again. Part horror, part comedy and fully enjoyable. Check it out!
B000BUYP4Q|4|I must say out of the entire series of Batman movies, this one is the best. It makes the most sense. I loved the way it followed to life of Bruce Wayne in terms of how he actually becomes Batman. The other films didn't really do this, and if they did, somehow I missed it. It's my thought that the other films focused too much on the stars, and not enough on the story of Batman, itself. This movie is more closely related to the comic strip. It shows Batman as the dark character he is, without, compromising his compassion. This is a must see. I recommend it. I enjoyed it very much!!!
B00DUGCLY4|4|This app is great because it gets you to think. Which is great for a brain exercise but it is free and fun.
B0057GYO9K|5|a classic
B00846REIS|5|Some might say quite a lot of similarities between FSOG and this book, but I sincerely believe the story line of BTY is so much more. I couldn't keep this book down. Every free minute I had, I was picking it up. A good read.
B003ZSJ212|1|***EDIT***  Ok, fine I bought the 6 movie set (used). The things that looked awful on YouTube still are. Star Wars (A New Hope) and Jedi suffer the most.  The new HD transfer really reveals how badly done Jar Jar is in the Phantom Menace. He looks like an \\"in-progress\\" shot of an effect that will be added later. It's especially bad on Naboo. None of the bizarre \\"there's an entire city under this medium sized lake\\" stuff was fixed. Yoda looks MUCH better.  Attack of the Clones is still terrible.  Revenge of the Sith looks amazing. The acting still lets the movie down until the last half.  For all the movies the sound and picture quality is really very good. A New Hope seems most improved in that regard. Jedi and Revenge of the Sith have the best picture quality of the 6. All the movies have sound the was reworked considerably. Most of the changes are for the better.  Having Said all of that. The needless and poorly executed changes to the movie really spoil what would have been an amazing set. Why waste so much time and effort looping in bad dialog or adding rocks that vanish for no reason? Most of the simple FX changes/upgrades work, and have since Lucas first started all this \\"tinkering\\". None of the story changes have worked. Han shot first because he was a pirate and a smuggler. That's why his transformation into a hero was so powerful. He wasn't mean, but he wasn't above shooting a guy either. The Jabba the Hutt we meet in Jedi is a \\"Vile Gangster\\". The Jabba Lucas shoehorned into that unused scene in A new Hope is a guy you can literally step on. Now Darth Vader has been diminished just a bit because Lucas didn't trust the power of the original scene.  *** End of EDIT***  Tinker with the films all you want George, just don't make them worse. Also, why not allow people to watch the unaltered versions -- they are classic pieces of cinematic history. After seeing the previews I'm not interested in seeing the new alterations to the film. They seem to range from pointless to terrible. Adding new space ships or correcting old compositing issues or color timing is one thing -- weakening pivotal character moments is another.
B001AT4Y84|3|Terminator 3 is a good movie, and if you like the first 2 classic ones you may enjoy it....But is not great as the first 2....
B00DJFIMW6|5|It is a fun game to play by itself but putting minions in there makes it even more fun to play everyday
B00HXYKYIE|3|Not up to par. Elephant stuff interesting and sad. Characters did not hold my interest but surprise ending was a surprise! Did not see it coming.
B003Z0D4S2|5|Needless to say : a great finish to the trilogy.
B0084AZXKK|5|OK, I never read Treasure Island as a kid.  But I watched the Muppet Treasure Island with my kids :-)<br /><br />Finally reading this book I see why the Muppets were able to get such great material from it.  What a swashbuckling good read!
B00A2LOAKI|5|I am afraid I have lied. This is not a five-star movie. It is a ten-star movie! The whole thing is wonderfully voice acted and animated. The joker is just completely awesome ! If you like Batman you must watch this!
B005K17RU0|5|Accuweather is accurate and up to the minute. Nice app . Easy to read information.  Able to check multiple locations easily and fast. A great tool thats readily accessed on my kindle fire.
B008XG1X18|5|love this app!  Easy to pin and keeps your place when you pin.  Would recommend if you like Pinterest - plus you can't beat free!
B00HY7YXIM|4|too much nudity......but I always enjoy period pieces.
B003FHGI9W|5|This movie really touched my heart.  Hachi is a true and devoted dog. I loved dogs and this movie shows how much he loves his owner!
B00CW6DAKC|3|so I have had this game for a long time then one day I go to open it up it and I randomly have a new salt lake half my animals are gone every thing is moved around and almost all my trees are gone. I am really mad!!!!! This needs to be fixed!!!
B004EF8AJA|5|This is an excellent period piece,  I enjoyed the story line and the characters were very well developed.  It played like a good book I did not want to end.  Like a good book you can return to ever so often I will watch this again  on a winter day it is comforting.
B005LAIHQS|4|Having not been a big fan of the original \\"Men in Black\\" or its terrible 2002 sequel, this belated third entry in the series comes as a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Here, Will Smith's Agent J finds his world being altered, wiping out the entire existence of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) along with it. As it turns out, an extraterrestrial menace has broken free from a prison on the moon, gone back in time and terminated K's life back in the `60s. In order to save the galaxy and his partner, J heads back in time and meets with a younger K (Josh Brolin, brilliantly mimicking Jones' mannerisms and delivery) in order to stop the vile Boris the Terrible (Jemaine Clement).<br /><br />The first two \\"Men in Black\\" films got by due to the chemistry between the stars, although I found both pictures to be hollow, one-joke pictures that relied too heavily on special effects. Despite a great deal of trouble behind the scenes with this third installment (production had to be shut down for several weeks while the script was reworked), \\"Men in Black 3\\" relies more strongly on its characters and what turns out to be a poignant story line as opposed to a neverending succession of wacky aliens and make-up FX. The film does have - as cliched as it sounds - a lot more heart than its predecessors, with Smith seeming more engaged, Brolin giving a lively performance, and Michael Stuhlbarg chipping in a particularly noteworthy role as a benign, Mork-like alien who spends his life perpetually analyzing possible future outcomes.<br /><br />Director Barry Sonnenfeld helms the material without as much of a frenetic hand this time around - something that might disappoint viewers expecting a larger and louder sequel, but a decision that makes for a more satisfying and developed dramatic experience than its predecessors.<br /><br />Sony's Blu-Ray offerings include a good looking 2D presentation of the film (1080p AVC encoded transfer, DTS MA audio) as well as a fairly effective 3D rendering with decent depth-of-field effects. Extras include an Ultraviolet copy, DVD, and fairly light supplements taking viewers behind the scenes with roughly an hour of content on the 2D BD and a couple of brief extras exclusive to the 3D BD (including a very short look at the conversion process).
B0051O8Z66|5|Its better than the version in the UK as the import you get more song (8)extra and i put it on my I Pod<br /><br />Cool
B00AKOB7CG|3|It's a free ap. Has limited access and to get full access it cost money, but it's ok. I don't think I'd pay for the full version though.
B008LIRDU8|1|The cover displayed online for the Kindle Version is the same as the cover for the Vintage International translation by Matthew Ward (which is one of my favorites).  The Kindle version is not that book.<br /><br />I started reading the digital version and the first lines are \\"Mother died today. Or maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure\\" versus the Ward translation \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know\\".  After realizing that it's not the same book as my physical copy I skimmed the rest of it - just skimming it i see that this version has lost almost all of the intensity as the original.  I skipped to the ending and found that that too is totally butchered.<br /><br />This is a huge disappointment.  I would highly advise not to order this copy.
0736430512|3|could have been bigger with more pictures Kathyrn at Kmartellmackenzie@yahoo.com.sg but since my granddaughter was turning 3 she liked it anyway despite the fact it was a smaller book
B001ANSS5K|5|I can't wait until the movie comes out but the book will be way better. Loved this book so much.
B00001QGPR|4|Another solid album from David Bowie.  If you grew up with his early stuff, it is hard to make the transition to his new attempts to break in to the modern market.  What he does manage to come up with is an album that doesnt stray much from his original theme, which is dance music meets old school bowie.   <br />Very listenable, and one of his best albums of the last 10 years.
B00CSYRHG6|5|This is a review for the product itself.  I was a little upset to see that this title was not released by Disney, but my feelings changed immediately upon receiving the product.  The case and slipcase both look fine, and the &#34;booklet&#34; inside of the case is much better than I would have expected.  I haven't tried playing the DVD yet, but the Blu-ray Disc looks fantastic.  The image does jump around ever so slightly, but it's hard to notice as the movie goes on and you continue to be absorbed into the world it portrays.
B00CDV6WDS|2|too small to really enjoy it.  I should have know since the same thing happened with angry birds. I will stay away from apps like this.
B0094BB4TW|2|I downloaded the app and it worked great. But once the kindle turned off i could not access the app unless i went back through the app store and found it. It would not properly download on my kindle or my cloud...
B00985E3UG|4|everyone should read this book

B000003RCY|4|Sehnsucht and Live aus berlin were a little bit better but Herzelied is definitely a great cd. only problem with it is, it is not as fast tempo on the cd as on stage. I dont know if tht is good or not
B00KFW4EFA|5|Works great!
B004H8GLXQ|5|This novel grabs your attention right away and unravels an interesting tale.  The ending is unexpected and the characters believable.
B00BEIYMIS|2|This movie serves as a big wet sloppy kiss to Ed and Lorraine Warren, from the moment it opens and we see them saving folks from a demon haunted Raggedy Anne doll (Google it) to the final scenes where the two hold each other and look on as the family they've saved tussles in the yard before them like a litter of likable but ultimately helpless puppies.<br /><br />Now as it happens, the Warren's don't just take on cases. When they get involved, they are likely to help you with your laundry, or fix up that dilapidated clunker you're never going to get to. They're just Good Folk. You might get some snark from Ed if you ask why he puts a thermostat on a camera, but seriously, these are world renowned paranormalists and who are you to question their strange ways?<br /><br />Ed believes wholeheartedly in exorcisms, but says these are best left for Vatican pros. In a pinch though, Ed can be persuaded to just 'wing it' and get rid of the demon that has made you its 'vessel'.<br /><br />I have to give the movie a couple of stars because it did manage to make me jump exactly twice. Before watching it, you should know the following additional things:<br />- Lack of originality. There is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen done to death before. We all know that basements are big no nos in a horror movie, that rooms become colder when paranormal activities are going on, that your pets are going to freak out in such situations, that the 'little girl' is going to have an uncanny connection with the spirit realm.<br />- Too much in common with other Warren cases. You know, like the Amityville horror which they only had a marginal association with. Guess what, same cold factor, dog factor, spooky time of day (3:15 vs 3:07) factor, family circumstance, etc.<br />- No conjuring. I mean really, if you aren't going to call the movie Poltergeist Redux or  An Exorcism in Schmamityville, at least work the title of your movie into the content somehow. Sheesh.
0345525558|5|My favorite book of the year. A very touching and compelling story and I love how she ends each chapter.<br />All the characters are wonderful!
B006RB8BQQ|5|This is a great book for molecular biologists. The kindle edition looks nice. It is very convenient to have a digital version of this book, since the printed version is very thick and impossible to carry around.
B00BETX5PS|5|Great movie!
B00EMXBDMA|5|Incredibly smart, creative, funny and engaging - a text book in adventurous story form. It feels like it was written for the movie that it will soon be. The history of this author and his publication journey is interesting in itself - look him up! Foul language (especially the f word) numerous times throughout the book, so younger or sensitive readers beware. Feels real, all the excitement of true space travel including the science that defines it, and most importantly you need to find out what happens to him! :) Highly recommended.
B00W3V83QW|5|I have this game on my phone.  I love this game!!! I like that it has bonus hours so you can earn extra items!  Keep up the good work on your app..<br />Thank you<br />Melissa

B005HEFB6M|5|Good show
B0055SWM08|5|I think this game is sweet! idk what other people r thinking when they say it isn't as good on the kindle fire because I played it on 1 and it didn't bug me!
B00B2V66VS|5|It is so much fun
B00FATEJYE|2|The game is awesome, my only problem is there is no way way to contact anyone with issues, like why my console and mobile games don't link so I can't unlock special features and why is my challenges starting over on me when I exit the game.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3|BEWARE: The Amazon store version of the game is always a long time behind the Play store version as far as updates go. Also forces the Amazon game center thingy on you. Otherwise, it is great.
B006LSZECO|5|I absolutely loved this book. Every chapter left me wanting more and more. I kept reading and it happens to be one of my favorite books. It is worth a read and I can't wait to watch the movie when it comes out. AMAZING
B008P1EWIM|5|THIS IS BEAUTIFUL AND INFORMATIVE; LINKS TO WEB PAGE.  CHECK IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.  CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS DURING INTERESTING WEATHER.
B000BTEQJQ|3|A very stirring performance of La Traviata, highlighted by a great cast, Sutherland, Pavarotti, Milnes and Von Stade, all in their primes and in great voice. By 1970 Sutherland's interpretation of Violetta had grown tremendously from her first studio recording. Pavarotti and Milnes sing Alfredo and Germont beautifully. This CD sounds like a pirated recording and at times everything sounds like it is coming from the bottom of a barrel, with the audience's noices being front and center at times. Also, the recording level  balance favors Pavarotti in his duets with Sutherland; his voice is crystal clear and I assume do to the immense size of her soprano, her voice is awash in distortion. If you can find it cheap, it may be worth it to either Sutherland or Pavarotti fans.
B00B2V66VS|5|I love temple run. It is one of my best games:-D .  I recomend it to every body;-) . I play it all the time:-)

B0017U7PT6|4|i saw so much bad reviews so i decided to buy the blu ray... a way to go against the trend...i regret nothing.If you belongs to the ones who love beautifull photography and masterpiece spécial effects this is the movie to  own in your collection.  The blu ray version is worth the price.  I don't give 5 stars because the scénario is a bit \\"light\\"..but nevertheless it is a fully enjoyable movie...
B00F88U4J6|4|like it very much
B00KWTZ1RG|5|How can this movie get anything less than 5 stars?
B006LXQID8|5|In my top ten favorites
B005GFPZYK|5|Could not put this book down. Painted great pictures of the war on terror. I recommend this book to everyone.
B0089LOG02|5|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  I love historical fiction, but this seemed like a strange premise. As I started reading, however, I realized that this was a part of history that I had not heard of before-the Orphan Trains.  I knew nothing about thousands of orphaned or destitute children from New York were shipped to the Midwest to be taken in and hopefully adopted by families.  This book seamlessly weaves together the story of Vivian and Molly. Molly is a 17 year old foster child who has been bounced around the system for years.  She is almost aged out, and is looking at a very uncertain future.  When a small misstep almost lands her in juvie, she accepts a community service sentence to help clean out 91 year old Vivian's attic.  While working together, she learns Vivian's story.  As a young girl, Vivian immigrated to the U.S. from Ireland in the late 1920′s.  When a fire claims the lives of her entire family, the Children's Aid Society steps in and places Vivian along with other orphans onto trains bound for the Midwest.  There, they will hopefully find families that want to adopt them.  Unfortunately, more often than not, these families were looking for free labor.  The story alternated between Molly in the present day, and back flashes of Vivian's experiences.<br /><br />I really loved learning about the orphan trains and seeing history unfold through Niamh/Dorothy/Vivian's eyes. I also learned quite a bit about the Penobscot Indians.  I thought this was a very well written, engaging story and would strongly recommend reading it.  I am so glad She Reads picked such a great selection for the May Book Club.  Please stop over there and see what others thought of this book.<br /><br />I posted this and other reviews at my blog- http://turnthepagereviews.com
6302787300|1|&quot;At least Columbus had the wit, in his madness, to mistake Venezuela for the outskirts of Paradise.  But he remarked on the availability of cheap slave labor in Paradise.&quot; -- Ursula K. LeGuin<br />True to our colonial tradition of valorizing conquerors, this film ignores the inconvenient facts of New World History:  the genocide of the Tainos (Columbus himself led an attack against them), their decimation and starvation, the repartimiento and encomiendo slave systems set up by the Columbus brothers on Hispanola, and all the rest of the sordid story.  A ruthless opportunist who loved wealth and titles, Columbus went to the New World for two reasons:  he saw himself as a &quot;Christ-bearer&quot; (his own term) to primitives, and he wanted something he mentions dozens of times in his diary:  gold.<br />Were all the whites evil and all the Indians good?  Of course not.  But it is not an exercise in black-and-white thinking to remember those who perished in the gold mines, who starved to death on the roads, and who fell down in fear before the cannons brought to intimidate them into obedience.  It is their stories that the victors have silenced, glamorizing instead their persecutors and colonizers.<br />Until someone makes a more honest film about the man responsible for so much death that his actions with the Indians shocked even the Spanish crown, here are a few quotations taken directly from his own journals:<br />------------------<br />...Having banished all the Jews from all your Kingdoms and realms, during this same month of January Your Highnesses ordered me to go with a sufficient fleet to the said regions of India.  For that purpose I was granted great favors and ennobled; from then henceforward I might entitle myself Don and be High Admiral of the Ocean Sea and Viceroy and perpetual Governor of all the islands and continental land that I might discover and acquire...<br />They ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them.  I think they can easily be made Christians, for they seem to have no religion.  If it pleases Our Lord, I will take six of them to Your Highnesses when I depart, in order that they may learn our language.<br />All that these people have they will give for a very ridiculous price; they gave one great basket of cotton for the end of a leather strap.  These people are very free from evil and war...I have to say, Most Serene Princes, that if devout religious persons knew the Indian language well, all these people would soon become Christians.  Thus I pray to Our Lord that Your Highnesses will appoint persons of great diligence in order to bring to the Church such great numbers of peoples, and that they will convert these peoples, just as they have destroyed those who would not confess the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br />I see and know that these people have no religion whatever, nor are they idolaters, but rather, they are very meek and know no evil.  They do not kill or capture others and are without weapons.<br />Today there came to the side of the ship a canoe with six youths in it, and five came aboard.  These I ordered held and am bringing them with me.  Afterwards I sent some of my men to a house west of the river, and they brought seven women, small and large, and three children.  I did this so that the men I had taken would conduct themselves better in Spain than they might have otherwise, because of having women from their own country there with them.<br />&quot;It is said, by Las Casas among others, that what perplexed the Tainos of Espa&ntilde;ola most about the strange white people from the large ships was not their violence, not even their greed, nor in fact their peculiar attitudes toward property, but rather their coldness, their hardness, their lack of love.&quot; -- Kirkpatrick Saletever we say to them.

B00PTB7B34|5|Tjis games is so cool good job guys !
0439023521|5|I was intrigued by the Hunger Games. I kept seeing it on bookstores' shelves, and was wondering if a new trilogy could outperform recent, successful ones. Mixed reviews kept fuelling my interest. My verdict: very good. Fast-paced, well written, engaging, unusual, smart, and... bloody. I am in between two minds about the bloody aspect of the novel, which is usually put on the young adult shelves. Thinking about it, I wouldn't be very keen on my children reading it until they are old enough. True, some of what they watch and read nowadays is almost worse than this. The premise of the novel is a game organised by a Government built on the remnants of what used to be the USA, featuring a group of children of all ages brought together in a large fenced area, and asked to fight to death with each other until there is only one last, successful fighter. The game is filmed: reality TV at its worst. I have a problem with premises featuring children killing each other for pleasure (not that those in the book really want to kill each other to start with); you just don't want those ideas in our children's minds. But then again, this is fiction. I loved \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding, a terrible story about children stuck on a remote island and starting to kill each other, but the premise was different (a reenactment of society, not a game) and it was really an adult book at the end of the day. Having said that, I really liked the Hunger Games. It think it is innovative, clever and has a great plot. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.
B007O4XX9K|5|got this for my husband and he listens to it often and is really enjoying it.  Thanks so very much!
B00H83EUL2|5|A great movie.  Even better at the Imax, but a big TV works in a pinch.
B00JH3S0AI|5|ScarJo showing off her world class assets.  She is naked early in and in skin tight jeans throughout the movie.  Some scary stuff happens, but I didn't notice much apart from ScarJo.    I saw the whole thing.  It is actually pretty good.  Spooky, haunting, scifi.  Sad for ScarJo's character at the end...
B00607EWYC|5|Tinkers is a beautifully crafted, brief novel about three generations of New England fathers, the Crosbys. But don't let its brevity fool you, it is packed with powerful,explicative and textured writing that is to be savored.<br /><br />A tinker is a mender, and each of these fathers was a tinker of one kind or another. The eldest, a minister who was always writing and re-writing sermons. The next, Howard,  a peddler who sold pots, pans and other goods, constantly assembling and mending and finds some of his joy in working with these items. Finally, George, who we learn in the book's first sentence, is 8 days from death and surrounded by family and friends. George repaired clocks, and the clock is a nice metaphor for his life and life in general.<br /><br />Tinkers moves through 3 different narratives. George's last week of life as he hallucinates in and out of consciousness, and then snippets from the lives of his father and grandfather. I personally found Howard's narrative the most poignant but all were beautifully and skillfully written. You will quickly learn that the book is driven less by plot and more by its sentences. There is a rich, descriptive text that let's you feel these moments and know these men in a relatively brief span of pages. This is a book to be read and re-read, its sentences to be enjoyed and admired for their power of description.<br /><br />I also did a little reading about the author, Paul Harding and found his own story fascinating.  He was told by agents and publishers for 3 years that Tinkers was too slow and contemplative for them to take a risk on. When he finally got it published, it basically arose out of \\"nowhere\\" to win the 2010 Pulitzer. The NY Times hadn't even reviewed the book! Tinkers is certainly a worthy winner, and is well worth your money and time.
B007PTJOV0|5|Love this game.  I can not believe how hard but easy it is.  It is so much fun.  Love it.
B000035P7S|5|I must admit I have watched this movie at least ten times. After renting it over and over at the video store, I finally broke down and bought it. I still watch it.  I don't remember why I picked it up at the video store the first time, but I was so very impressed when I watched it.  It is a fascinating love story and very well told. The acting is superb. James Garner is a nice surprise, and of course, Brando is at his best.  It tells a great story of the difficult choice many men faced in the military while stationed in Japan after WWII when they fell in love and wanted to marry their Japanese girlfriends.  I credit all those attached with the film for their wisdom in making this film about love that transcinds racial barriers.
B00BQPEIT2|5|Have not seen the movie yet. But really looking forward to it. Love the different worlds. The flying monkey are great
B004UFEJW6|5|This is one of my all-time favorite movies and just had to have it on Blu-ray. This is a movie that you need to watch not just with your eyes, but with your heart.  The dialogue, or lack there-of, speaks volumes.  If you're looking for a Star Wars or Van Damme film, go buy those, because this is a much deeper story.  Kurt Russell was fantastic.  His facial expressions more than made up for the scarce dialogue.  He is a soldier, selected at birth and trained for war.  After 35 years or so, he and his teammates are replaced by &#34;better&#34; lab-created, chemically maintained, solders.  He knows nothing else, as this was his entire life.  Ultimately he is marooned on a planet where is finds and is welcomed by a small group of people that crash landed there.  He is forced out of the community, out of fear, but returns to their aid when the new soldiers accidentally show up while on a training mission. This is a story of two wars, one between the soldiers, and one for Kurt's humanity.
B008FSCNTK|3|Not my favorite, I usually love Diana Krall’s versions. This here seems a bit constructed. The music matches the picture. (Does she really need that?)
B004VUP8WK|1|Before I kick off this review for the album, I'd like to say that while Morbid Angel certainly wasn't a perfect band (\\"Domination\\" and \\"Heretic\\" were pretty mediocre albums, but the rest ranged from really good to godlike), I felt for many years a certain comfort that Morbid Angel would never release such mainstream drivel that would be on par with such pathetic artists like Marilyn Manson and Disturbed.  After the disappointment that was \\"Heretic,\\" the death metal community rejoiced once David Vincent came back in the band and we all waited for the ultimate comeback album from such a huge name in death metal.  It was a long wait, and all we got out of that wait was one of the most laughable albums ever released by a veteran death metal band.  It was eight years between \\"Heretic\\" and \\"Illud Divinum Insanus,\\" and given how horribly lazy and awful this album sounds, it's like they waited until the night before the album's launch date to make the album.<br /><br />BAD EXPERIMENTATION<br /><br />Experimentation has been a signature quality for Morbid Angel since they released the godlike \\"Altars of Madness,\\" and while some of it went a little south, the band's past mistakes look like mosquito bites compared to this curse upon the death metal community.  This time around, Morbid Angel thought it would be a great idea to mix metal with industrial music.  This isn't breaking any new ground as there was quite a few metal bands that did this in the early 90's (most notably Fear Factory's \\"Fear is the Mindkiller\\" remixes and Godflesh's \\"Slavestate\\").  I'm also not against the idea because I really like old-school industrial, whether it be the filthy and grungy monolithic slabs of crushing terror in Godflesh's \\"Streetcleaner\\" and their electronic yet percussive nightmare that is \\"Slavestate,\\" to the dark, dance-inducing and abstractly poetic soundscapes of Skinny Puppy's \\"Bites\\" and \\"Too Dark Park.\\"  The problem with \\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\" is that the fusion of metal and industrial was done horribly.  Instead of sounding something like notable Godflesh songs such as \\"Christbait Rising\\" and \\"Someone Somewhere Scorned\\" or the Deep Dub Trauma Mix of the Fear Factory song \\"Scumgrief\\" (which are all pulverizing and daunting), the industrial-flavored songs on this album sound like Marilyn Manson and Static X leftovers flavored with some death metal elements.  Did Morbid Angel forget that a good deal of their fans started listening to them to GET AWAY from such mainstream garbage, so what makes them think we'd listen to an album that sounds a lot like such vomit?<br /><br />THE BAD SONGS<br /><br />The album starts off pretty decently with a typical Morbid Angel synth intro named \\"Omni Potens,\\" but there will be very few peaks when that ends, for we go on with \\"Too Extreme!\\"  Nope, that's not a joke to get people riled up, that's really the name of the song, and what a terrible song it is.  Like the back catalog of such mainstream tripe like Marilyn Manson, there's canned start-stop rhythms and lame electronic backgrounds and mind-numbing lyrics that even feature Vincent growling in Spanish, and yes, it's them bragging about how \\"extreme\\" they are.  \\"Destructos vs the Earth/Attack\\" sounds like a Sailor Moon fanfiction if the author decided to shoehorn an anti-human theme into it, and given that Trey Azagthoth loves Sailor Moon, I wouldn't be surprised if he spent a weekend watching that anime nonstop and decided to pen a song from it.  The song itself sounds like a dumbed-down marching anthem, with some start-stop garbage and lame chantings.  This is all you get in that song, don't expect any blastbeats or the amazing guitar solos Morbid Angel is famed for.  Then there's the disaster known far and wide as \\"Radikult.\\"  First of all, did they honestly try to cash in on Linkin Park's gimmick of really bad spelling?  Second, the song starts off with what's either \\"Kill a cop\\" or \\"Killa cult,\\" regardless of which it is, it sounds laughable (especially the former, as it's nothing like Morbid Angel).  The song itself is really boring with the same bad riff being repeated over and over again with flatulent \\"rockstar\\" lyrics bragging about how they've been \\"crossing the line since 1989.\\"  The tedium is broken a little with a neat guitar solo, but that's just a window dressing to poorly cover up a bad song, and it ends with some pretentious chanting and canned synths.  I could keep going with songs like \\"Profundis-Mea Culpa,\\" but I think you get the picture.<br /><br />MIDDLE GROUND<br /><br />\\"10 More Dead\\" has its pros and cons, as the lyrics were pretty weak (though no ego-driven swill, thankfully) and the riffs were merely okay, but the blastbeats and guitar solo were quite good, and the same can be said for \\"I am Morbid\\" (though with weaker lyrics).<br /><br />THE DECENT SONGS<br /><br />The reason this isn't getting a total goose egg is that there's some decent songs on here.  Songs like \\"Existo Vulgore,\\" \\"Blades for Baal,\\" \\"Nevermore,\\" and \\"Beauty Meets Beast\\" are bittersweet reminders to us of what Morbid Angel's signature sound is and what the whole album should have been.  \\"Beauty Meets Beast\\" is a delightfully sleazy track that's more on the midpaced side of things, but has some exquisite guitar work and ear-grabbing riffs.  \\"Nevermore\\" is probably the most favored track by fans, and for good reason, as this is the best song on here.  This is the fast-paced and technically-accomplished death metal brutality Morbid Angel does best, with the brutality taking the forefront coupled with diverse and well-written dynamics.  The four songs I just mentioned in this section are really the best songs on this album, and if you're a \\"lemons into lemonade\\" type of person, can be a glimmer of hope that Morbid Angel will drop that techno drivel in their next album and write songs akin to the four good ones listed here.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />This is easily Morbid Angel's worst album, and given how it ultimately destroyed this notion that David Vincent was a better fit for the band than Steve Tucker, I hope it makes those cynical of Tucker to check out \\"Formulas Fatal to the Flesh\\" and \\"Gateways to Annihilation,\\" which not only decimate this album in terms of quality, but also gives an appreciation for Tucker's presence in the band in the past.  Never in my life as a death metal fan would I have imagined that Morbid Angel would fall so hard.  Other than \\"Domination\\" and \\"Heretic,\\" just stick with Morbid Angel's other albums, including the collection of demos from 1986 entitled \\"Abominations of Desolation\\" (which featured Nocturnus drummer and vocalist Mike Browning, as he was MA's first drummer).<br /><br />David Vincent and/or Trey Azagthoth, if you're reading this right now, I hope you're ashamed of yourselves, I honestly expected MUCH better from you.like Morbid Angel).

B00L9B7IKE|5|Couldn't put this down since I picked it up. When I couldn't read it I was thinking about when I would be able to next. Great book.
B000FC1HBY|5|This book is a real page turner, it is fast paced and picks up on the action from where the first book left off
0812550757|4|Not the quality of Ender but still pretty good.  It's not 'til the next volume (Xenocide) that he starts to get distracted and weird.
B00GAVJ77K|5|This is one awsome app , it doesn't play around . As soon as you install it , it goes to work , in a matter of seconds it cleans ,scans , and it runs a virus scan and that's it , you're done . No muss ,no fuss and next thing you know your phone or kindle is flying super fast , memory , storage all taken care of . Did I mention it only takes a couple of seconds . If you don't believe me try it out for yourself . It couldn't be easier .
B005IZLPKQ|4|Captain America is my favorite if the Marvel heroes because of the age he came from. His character is so moral, so good and so steadfast. This film is beautifully shot with warm hues and scenes, the look of the 40s with the clothes, hair, make-up and lighting is excellent. Hayley Atwell is perfect for Agent Carter, and Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious. With a great musical score by Alan Silvestri, this is Marvel's best- although I will have to admit if you think about all the Marvel heroes, his is one of the saddest stories. Good action flick that teaches a good lesson.
006621131X|5|I could not put this book down, darkly romantic and brutally honest. Patti describes in detail thew struggles of two young artists in NYC trying to find themselves and their rise to fame.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun game! I haven't had to purchase anything yet. Just use your energy wisely and complete the tasks. Just wish there were more awards the higher in levels you go. I also don't have &#34;friends&#34; on this game because I don't want it to link to my Facebook and annoy everyone else with game posts. Wish the r e was another way to find other random Amazon friends to &#34;friend&#34;. Overall good entertainment as is!
B000002U82|5|Well...this is the first remastering of this CD. That may not be counting imports so, I mean this is the first LOCAL remastering. It sounds really good and there are no buzzing or clicking noises. Except, when they're actually part of the music. There are no bonus tracks. Now, this is the most popular of Pink Floyd's albums. It also, happens to be one of the top selling albums in America and elsewhere. The reason being, this was the moment that Psychedelic Rock officially became a recognized genre. Or sub-genre, to be more specific. The songs are a solid bunch of weirdness, but that is really a good thing. All of them have been immortalized through the power of radio. In short: This is a good CD for hippies, writers, philosophers and the like. It's great, even after all these years!
B00003CXA2|1|You know, it is a sweet, endearing movie and yet at the same time it kicks us while we're down.<br />It seems that all of the characters that have fallen on hard times due to the bad decisions that they make SHOULD be pitied because quite frankly, Forrest Gump NEVER should be.<br />What am I driving at?<br />Let's face it--this movie is not a triumph of human will over adversity.  All of Gump's successes and triumphs are more about circumstance than actual effort.  Case in point:  Gump's shrimp outfit soars...only because every other shrimping vessel was laid waste while his ship miraculously survived.  Is this something that we should applaud--Gump's triumph over the misfortune of others?  Like I said, it's hard to find a story likeable about someone who doesn't know any better succeeding where other WHO DO TRY fail...and fail miserably.  That's not to say that those who failed didn't deserve to.  Jenny is an example of that, but for crying out loud, she was REAL in her intentions and decisions.  <br />I don't think the film deserves the same amount of success that Gump himself experiences.  Hanks is a brilliant actor and this film is no exception...but if life is a box of chocolates, then this film is a 10-year old nougat left in a puddle on the road.
B00062PN6I|5|I absolutely love these headphones.  I was looking for something on the low end price wise because the kids break my headphones all the time, and these have an excellent sound for the price.  After wearing for long periods they aren't quite as comfortable, but overall well worth the price if you need a cheap set of headphones.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is addicting and totes ridic. I hear u subway surfers but I'm only rating this to get coins. Peace. Love. Respect.
B00BVYNSLC|4|Not quite what I expected from the previews but interesting nonetheless. Tatiana is very talented to be able to pull off her many clone roles, accents, personalities, etc. Jordan plays a sometimes hilarious role as a gay man. Their British accents are fairly convincing as far as I can tell, and I can tell what part of the UK a person is from by their accent. I like the show but you may not. Sometimes it is predictable, sometimes you don't see it coming.  I have only watched the first season.
1577314808|3|I do not take to his book as well as to others.  It is not quite what I need.  Too passive.  It ws recommended and when my trader friends recommend something we all buy it.  But this one, I have to admit I do not pick up to learn from.  It is now in the lirbrary and is not something I would have necessarily have bought, but it is just me, we are all different.

B004J4WLB4|5|I LOVED this book! It was an instant page turner and several months after reading it, I am still thinking about the story.  I loved the way the story was told from past to the present.  I wished I would have kept the flower dictionary that was at the end for future reference.
B000HL09SA|5|I've loved this movie ever since it came out!! I would advise families to watch this movie for it is awesome!
B001AVEJ1Y|1|As a lifelong star trek and sci-fi fan I'm shocked this movie is getting glowing reviews. As far as I'm concerned this movie devolved sci-fi.   Yes, I loved the original star trek as a kid but as time has moved forward I've gotten used to better characters and more innovative story lines. I'm enough of a fan of the series that the lack of imagination in the story line would have been forgiven if they had simply gone somewhere with the characters.    None of the characters came to life for me. Basically if I hadn't known them from the TV series they would not have had personalities. The worst was the James Kirk, who is even less evolved than the TV show counter point; I didn't really think THAT was possible.   I was so excited about this movie and it was a complete waste of time. Worse, they did such a poor job of developing a story line I doubt the movie would make sense to someone who hadn't watched the original series.   This was simply a vehicle to make lots of money from a firmly established fan base for a substandard story with poor characterization at least in the past that meant the special effects would be leap ahead but not this time, the special effects were average. Basically the only good thing I can say for it is that it's better than nothing but not by much.
B0025KVLUG|5|What can you say it's the Beatles!
B00FKF0F3C|5|Follett does an excellent job of relating history thru fictional characters, while holding the reader's attention. The context he creates and the inside story behind historic events is closer to the truth than most history books admit. I see that some of the other reviewers have been watching too much Fox News and are holding on to a fantasy world. Sorry to tell you, but Follett got it right.
B000002OTL|5|This is the best selections of songs I have ever had the pleasure of  listening to again and again. Everything about it is amazing, the snippets  of dialogue, the choice in music and sounds, the arrangement in respect to  the scenes from the movie, everything! I particularaly enjoyed the dialouge  between Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta about hash bars and personality  were screamingly funny, and the choices of songs like &quot;Son of a  Preacher Man&quot;, &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Town&quot;,  and one of my favorites off of the album, &quot;If Love Is A Red Dress,  Hang Me In Rags&quot;. I have read all of the other reviews and cannot  figure out why no one else likes thi song. Just listen to the words, they  are being sung from a truly crushed heart, it is one of the most real love  songs ever written.       I also liked the way that the sound bites fell on  the album, the best one being Ezekial 25:17 which is the last track on the  album. Just listen to Samuel's voice as he emotes the power, passion,  energy and rage behind ever syllable of that passage, it leaves you  breathless.       The choices of surf music to fill in the instrumental  portions of the soundtrack were inspired and perfectally fits the  mood of  the movie.      I highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone who craves  quality music from a quality movie.
B00AFEYUVG|4|Loved the movie! It has a great message and despite a sad plot and circumstance, it provides one with hope and optimism in a realistic setting.<br /><br />I bought this specifically hoping it would have the digital copy and it does - I happily added it to my iTunes movie library (and I may or may not have added it to Ultraviolet/Vudu... I can't remember).
015206396X|4|This book a great read!!The slow pace in the beginning is the only reason I would give it four stars. However I was elated and very satisfied when I finished reading the book.     In Katsa's universe, along with the normal people live people who possess a 'Grace'. A Grace is an ability or talent that the regular people lack. Katsa's grace is killing. A child with a killing Grace? Katsa was not welcomed in society once this ability was discovered. People maintained a distance from her. But the cunning ruler of her world however decided to hone her ability for his own questionable purposes and so a highly trained Katsa begins to heed the beck and call of her King.     In the midst of this, Katsa realizes her king is not always justified and forms a council with her friends who secretly help the suffering and the distressed. On one of these missions she meets Prince Po, a Graceling prince while rescuing none other than his grandfather!     Soon Po finds himself in her castle and they begin to form a heartwarming friendship. Burdened with the secret of his own grace, Po finds that he can truly understand Katsa. With his help, Katsa begins to fight her own inner demons and tries to come to terms with her inner being. She is afraid of turning into a monster. Soon she defies her King and leaves his court, showing everyone what she is truly made of and what she stands for.     Po and Katsa leave the castle and begin searching for the truth behind his grandfather's kidnapping. The rest of the story is what happens on this journey. Does Katsa come to terms with her emotional issues? Can she find peace within? Does she open her heart to Po like he opens up to her? Can she face her fears and find the mettle to overcome them? Does she find her true place in her world? And can she bring justice to Po's grandfather and help the innocent people who are suffering?     This book is a captivating read with an excellent plot and the right twists and turns. It really picks up pace in the latter half and is hard to put down. Katsa is a very well developed character and a strong inspiring protagonist. Her relationship with Po is perfectly balanced and is just what the doctor ordered for her. The author's ability to convey the manner in which Katsa deals with her emotional issues is truly noteworthy. It is believable and realistic and you will feel every emotion Katsa feels. The only one thing I wish it would have had is some kind of a physical weakness for Katsa. Making her a super human killing and survival machine was stretching it a bit too far. I mean every super hero has some weakness. Katsa had no Achille's heal whatsoever and is pretty much indestructible, physically I mean. Overall, it's a book I cherish and will definitely recommend to others.
B008AT9XOC|5|A classic!!
B006GLLXXK|5|So glad that another awesome feature for being a prime member is the free streaming of movies and shows all in hd. And I'm very glad it has older seasons of shows like this so I can re watch them
B00005JKG5|4|I was all of three years old when Flashdance was released in the spring of 1983.  However, while I was too young to see the movie, I knew the soundtrack by heart thanks to my older sister.  My mom finally decided I would be allowed to watch the movie when it was aired on NBC in early 1988.  Needless to say I loved it after all the years of waiting. <br /> <br />Everyone knows the plot,  welder by day, dancer by night.  Jennifer Beals was an unknown when she made this movie, and the movie transformed her (briefly) into a sensation.   She had a hard time following this film up,  but luckily due to Showtime's The L Word, she is back on top of her game. <br /> <br />Flashdance is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination,  if anything, it's some of the worst character development (save Beals' Alex) a movie this big has ever seen.  But all is forgiven when the music comes on.   This movie was made when MTV (when MTV meant music) was beginning to take off... this was in many ways like a series of music videos interspread with story.  From Maniac to Gloria to What A Feeling, this movie emphasised on music in a way unseen except maybe Saturday Night Fever. <br /> <br />I have seen Flashdance countless times, and I rushed out to buy the DVD the same week it came out, because I wanted it that badly. <br /> <br />I hope Paramount will give us a special edition DVD along the lines of Footloose... Beals is hot again, they can always bring her in for an interview or something like that.
B00CO8D3G4|4|Mr. Altucher writes in a particular style which grabs your attention.  Nine more unnecessary words are required in this review.
B00FPM1A16|4|Buy this!  Now!<br /><br />Why?  (1) Floor Jansen, the band's new female vocalist, is phenomenal.  She returns the operatic elements the band has been missing since the Once album while retaining the previous vocalist's ability to belt out notes to fill any venue.  Floor also owns her audience with her stage presence and musical engagement.  (2) Troy Donockley, is now on board and adds a new dimension to the band's sound with the pipes, flutes, and whistles.  Read pretty much every other amazon review for more.<br /><br />But... I can't in good conscience give this release a full 5 stars, for two reasons.<br /><br />First, where is Scaretale?  This is the Imaginaerum tour.  While I get that Floor is on vocals and the band wants to showcase her ability to sing older songs, Scaretale was one of the cornerstones of Imaginaerum... omitting it makes the album/show feel incomplete.  Floor has performed Scaretale live on numerous occasions.  Why not here?<br /><br />Second, with a multi-disc release of this magnitude, why not include a show with the band's previous vocalist, Anette Olzon?  I understand that Floor is the present and future of the band, but again, this is the Imaginaerum tour.  Why not give us a complete record?  As a true fan, I'm looking for as much variety as I can lay my hands on, and for this release, I would have loved to hear/see Olzon performing Imaginaerum and older songs.  Again, Olzon has performed songs like Dark Chest of Wonders, Sacrament of Wilderness, and Wish I Had An Angel live, but we've never gotten them on an official live release.  There's tons of material out there.  Perhaps in time when feelings mend and everyone grows up a little, we could get a show with all three of this band's female vocalists reunited not for themselves but for the fans.<br /><br />BUT aside from these two minor gripes, I LOVE this album.  As soon as I learned Floor would be taking over, I new this was the beginning of a new era of greatness for Nightwish.  Thislive show proves it.

B00IMV5054|4|A great story that will leave you as happy as frustrated when it is over. The propriety and decorum of women in this time period make you want to put your head in your hands. If only they behaved like women now.. this book would be about 30 pages long. Great writing by Austen, a must read for any Austen fan.

B009R659L8|5|Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors.  Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  I thought I'd figured it out but was totally wrong.  Was really surprised by the outcome.  I would recommend this book for anyone who likes suspense and mystery.

Clear, concise instructions, graphics great, and the projects are varied, and not difficult.<BR>I would recommend this book to beginners, even children and teen-agers I think, who are craft minded, would love the fabric folding, and the many ways in which to use the flowers.

B00CATSONE|5|its always great to read about great men in history and to read about their inventions that helped to get where we are today
B00AEBB9K0|4|The humor in this movie is underrated. There's no stereotype that doesn't get made fun of. There's a reason this movie has a cult following, it's just good.
B000002HH2|5|1. army of me: 8.0 (good intro song to POST, great material)<br />2. hyper ballad: 9.0 (the song that made me fall in love with bjork)<br />3. the modern things: 10.0 (one of the best. reminds me of the army...)<br />4. it's oh so quiet: 9.0 (so innovative for bjork)<br />5. enjoy: 8.5 (like crazy beat rock?) <br />6. you've been flirting again: 7.0 (simple yet meaningful)<br />7. isobel: 10.0 (one of her most popular)<br />8. possibly maybe: 10.0 (great song, check out the video)<br />9. i miss you: 9.0 (fun to dance to)<br />10. cover me: 7.0 (strange song, listen to the lyrics)<br />11. headphones: 10.0 (bjork most creative. listen for the barely audible whispers that bjork says in the backround)<br />ON THE BJORK'S OVERALL RATING SCALE... (average of all the songs)... &gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;8.9&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; buy it.
B005LAIHYU|5|Zombies are boring.<br />This show matches Jefferson Davis, Vampires, Gettyburg battle, etc.. with several nasty villians--one  played by the guy from PBS show Zen. We never saw enough Zen on PBS in the first place--now he's already a Vampire?
B00AIQP9DE|5|The graphics were nice.  No problems downloading and no problems with running slow.  I enjoyed the mix between the puzzles and the hos.  The only issue I have was it was a little short for the full price (5.00).  Still it's hard to find games like this that will run on older kindle fires so I it was okay for now.

B004LWZWGA|4|Didn't really like this Batman.  Out of the 3, I thought this was the worst one.  Got it to complete my collection though.  Waiting to see what they do with this Superman vs. Batman movie coming soon.
0345350499|5|This book is absolutely wonderful. I love the fact that the women in this book are so real. They are all flawed, yet they are all perfect. This is definetly a book for women who are tired of male dominated visions of women in fantasy. The charaters are so rich, deep, and complex. If Camelot had ever been a real place, this is surely how things really happened.
0345404475|5|This is one the BEST science fiction novels ever written, and a complete classic. Anyone who enjoys good science fiction, has a knack for animals, robots, strange psychic religions, and post-apocalyptic societies will love this book. Philip K. Dick has a talent for creating vibrant, &#34;complete&#34;, and meaningful realities, while staying light, funny and easy to read.
B00HZ3BGPS|4|Fun, Captivating movie. Worth watching.
B00BETX5PS|5|I've never seen a previous James Bond movie and found this to be quite exciting and captivating.  It's def. made me a bond fan.  I believe I will be reviewing the previous films.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Small and portable and able to start streaming....just could find a way to stop streaming without unplugging the chromecast or switching out of hdmi.  Probably just takes a bit more investigating but Apple TV is more intuitive.
0061992860|5|This book has the info you need to survive in the wild both short term and long term. There was a lot of work and detail put into this that is worth infinitely more than the money it costs. Everyone should get this. Put it in your bunker. Put it in your bug out bag. Never go anywhere without this.
B00DR0PDNE|1|Did not work for me too complicated to set up. Returned and ordered amazon fire stick for streaming easier to set up works fine thank you..
B00U7VDC7A|3|It is fun and layed back, you can put it down at any time and not worry about deadlines. Enjoyed the story.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This is a really good app it`s kinda like a puzzle game but different. I totally recommend this app.It works great with a kindle.
B008Q0B0I2|4|Nice family movie.  Enjoyed watching it.
B00005JKEZ|5|This is the best family oriented swashbuckling adventure movie ever made! And this remastered two disc version with its superb picture and many extras is well worth the purchase price!
B005LF9AOQ|5|My favorite show of all time
B000XUBFE2|5|has anybody seen the movie? it is so heart breaking! Liesel gets married to max, the Jew. did y'all know that
B00II5YUIW|5|If you liked other games from this developer you will love this game as well. No issues to report. Smooth game play with no issues. A little pricey compared to other games in the same genre though.<br /><br />Keep the games coming! I'll be waiting for the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Spend hours playing this game. A nice way to relax.
B004GJDQT8|5|Great
1439102724|2|I was excited about the fact that the main character is a music therapist because I am a music therapist.  The beginning of the book was excellent and the portrayal of what goes on in a music therapy session was fairly spot on.  However, the book quickly deteriorated, thus two stars.  The plot was so contrived and the Christians in this book were portrayed in such a terrible light.  I am a Christian and I really take offense.  Why, Jodi, why?  You usually portray Christians in a better light.  Actually, I thought the minor characters were fairly wooden.  In addition, the whole premise of the book is morally offensive and over-reaching.  This book would have been better without the same-sex stuff in it.  Instead, she should have just focused on the infertility and troubled marriage part.  THAT would have made the book MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE and not morally offensive.  Sorry, Jodi.  You missed on this one.
B004GYY714|5|lots of stations very easy to use
B00DHKKN6Q|3|Colorful and fun animation makes it attractive to children, but I am always disappointed in games that require purchases to continue even with all the ads
B008NCSZQ8|5|My grandchildren, ages 6 & 4 loved it. Would recommend it for children over 4 and up to 9 years old.
B00DR0PDNE|1|Garbage. Bought this at BB. Tried it out. Returned it the next day. Got apple tv instead. Well worth the extra money.
B003MYYJD0|5|What a solid as a rock, masculine, classy (in a manly way) watch. I feel good wearing this watch when I put it on, it has the weighted feel of a solid timepiece when it's on my wrist.  Not hard to setup but I have yet to figure out what the bottom left side curved open window on the watch face is for? The one on the right bottom side is obviously the day of the month.<br /><br />One thing that really threw me off is the second hand on this watch is a little bit different from any other watch I've owned. What I mean is there is a small red hand that goes around that turns out to be the second hand but the large gold hand that looks like a standard second hand on most watches stays stationary. That lead me to believe I had a watch that was DOA (dead on arrival) but turns out that large gold hand is actually the stop watch hand to follow when you activate the stop watch feature.<br /><br />The watch is relatively comfortable for a watch of this bulk and weight, but I will say the watch band has a gold buckle that is a bit of overkill, just a tad on the large size for the size of the band itself.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this watch to those who are comfortable wearing something a that is big and bulky.
B0067TQQI8|5|When a home or car charger are out of reach this handy little recharger will save the day. When at sporting events or on the beach my wife can keep this little recharger in her bag. I have checked to see exactly how many times it will recharge my Iphone 5 but I have charged it twice with plenty of energy left for more charging. Don't forget the cable for the Iphone 5 doesn't come with it. Innovative Digital USB to Lightning compatible Cable (5 inch) can be ordered separately.
B00HGJ18C2|4|More options would be nice especially considering all the ads but does the job.
B00785P2QC|4|I was searching for a &quot;Sim city&quot; type game and this hit the spot.while it IS hard to acquire investment points, I have no problem posting to Facebook. Those who are complaining just don't know how to use Facebook's posts properly :) I do wish land was easier to purchase and the hills were a bit cheaper to remove
B00EB6F1TY|5|well put together nothing more you can say it was fast pace just a movie you got to watch Very good movie
B0063IH60K|1|The game froze. I have not been able to play it since freezing.
B008NCSZQ8|5|This was my first streaming of a movie. It was great. Just like being at the movies. Amazon Prime is a hit.
B00005JO9J|5|Awesome thanks
B00G3L6KQI|5|A beautiful magical trilogy of stories that speaks of love loyalty equality and uniqueness.<br />I loved reading theses books and hope there are more to come.
B003F3PMYI|5|Thank You!! What an Amazing Book!! Love the Honesty, Examples, and How and Why you want to Apply these Principles - I'm  a Happy Person, but this is a whole New Level of self discipline!<br /><br />A Must Read!
B00AIQP9DE|5|Very visually entertaining.  Keeps a fast pace that calls to you to continue .  Not sure yet if it is worth the highend pricing:-)
B00AKL1XPU|5|The images are wonderful and I really enjoy this game.<br />My grandkids play it with me, so I couldn't' t be happier!<br />I give you 5 stars!!!
B00K0OI42W|5|This book was so uplifting it makes me want to be a better person I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5|Super addictive. You can really lose track of time with this game! I will be purchasing the app soon in no time!
B0032KLAKE|3|This is a good movie. I would rate it higher but it is a tad predictable. Great acting though and a good movie for those people interested in psychology.
B00RVC3YKI|5|This is a very long movie therefore I was grateful to watch it from home. It was like reading a very good book that I could not put down.
0393320928|5|Love this man! Can't get enough of reading about him. A brilliant and down to Earth fellow. Includes the period when he was on the Challenger Disaster Commission and that alone is very interesting! All told in first person. Enjoyed this book from page 1.
B004ADB17Y|5|Loved it as a kid and still love it today.  It was just like I remembered. My little one loves it too.
B0085P2Z6E|5|so far i have really enjoyed this game. the element of mystery is exciting. it seems differnt from all the other games ive bought for my kindle.
B005XUC398|1|I only received the first ten minutes of this download to my Tivo.  I am unable to find any way to return or redownload it.  This was money down the drain for me.  Kind of like dealing with Microsoft where the figure everything is your fault.
1400063515|3|This was the most eagerly awaited book this year for me. The US release was on 17th April and I managed to pre-order with a local bookstore (in India) and receive it on 20th April. <br /> <br />The book does not live up to the heightened expectations after \\"Fooled by Randomness\\".  The 1st few chapters give a background and the author's perception of the \\"Black Swan\\". For the rest of the book he keeps flogging a dead horse. Honest and crisp editing was what the book needed. <br /> <br />
B00005B36H|5|not much can be said that hasn't already, but i would only add that some quality headphones enhance a completely seamless musical composition that the world hasn't seen since the classical period. which may explain why other tool albums have been attempted by full orchestras.
B00ABGEFWC|5|You will absolutely love it. But you do not stay with a hourse your  whole life you get a change.
B00QW8TYWO|5|It gives you a great way to pass the time but your doing something fun
B0085A9HXS|5|I don't even know where to start.  This movie is fantastic. The action sequences were so much better than any other big budget Hollywood movie.  The sound effects were overall very good, 4 stars,  There was no plot line (didn't expect one).  The overall picture was 3.5 stars (the blacks seemed crushed in some scenes). Highly recommend.
B00008BLAS|4|Grand Funk wasn't showing any signs of falling apart just yet- that would happen with their next album, All the Girls in the World Beware.     While nothing from the Shinin' On album comes close to the incredible power and rocking energy of the title song with its fantastic rhythm beats, I can't find anything to complain about either.      Hearing this album for the first time after hearing all the other Grand Funk albums released before this one, you'll probably be shocked by the way the album sounds and the direction Grand Funk chose to take their music.  This is pretty much an obvious attempt to go commercial, though not really a necessary one since they WERE pretty popular before this after all, and the band also probably wanted to fit in with the times.     Whatever the reason might be, this is a pretty good album.   Don't expect a whole lot in the way of excellent guitar solos, but expect a decent songwriting effort.
B003EV6DBM|5|Great season for the Doctor Who fandom.
B007REV4YI|5|If you're a James Bond fan, this is awesome. If you're not - who knows? It's a great movie. I'll watch just about anything with Daniel Craig and Judi Dench - together they are a home run for me.
B0000UJL96|5|This is one of the greatest Star Trek films and continues the fact that even number trek films are great, except for those that are multiples of five, Star Trek Nemesis.
B009VB7QQA|1|Sorry to have donated a few bucks for, no doubt, the worst excuse for entertainment we have ever spent...Amazon buyers must never had watched this trash for even ten minutes...I left the room after six minutes and my wife and neighbor shut it off after about thirty minutes. What a cheap hollywood ploy on a great name...blasphemy,
B00127RAJY|5|This dvd is awesome.  I am a natural athlete, zumba instructor, marathoner and have done a million workout videos.  I have always struggled to keep the lbs. off and I absolutely love this video.  It is really tough but it's short so it makes it easier to stick with it.  It is also great for travel b/c all you need are hand weights which are easily improvised with some canned food or coke bottles (I travel a lot and don't get to work out when I travel.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this as an addition to your workout program.  I have been doing it for about 3 weeks about 5 times a week and I can definitely see results (4 lbs down.)  You have to watch you diet though too!
B001EBWINQ|5|Well directed. Humphrey Bogart was great. Ingrid Bergman was lovely. Good war time story, predictable but the storey was nicely spun.
0316067601|5|this book is amazing!!  i couldn't put it down... i read it in just a few days.  bought one for my brother-in-law who is thinking about joining the military... he said it was the first book he's read cover-to-cover since high school.  i told my sister about it... she got back from iraq a year ago... she loved it!!  and my 12 year old son has started reading it too.  can't think of another book that i've wanted to share so badly!!  i always thought i was pretty informed about things but this book gave me an even greater appreciation for our special forces.  it is amazing what they have to go thru and i am thankful every day that we have such brave soldiers serving our counrty.  true heroes.
B009FZHYKU|5|I was riveted to my seat for ever single second of every single episode or every single season!!!  The best!!
B0050XFY4O|5|Wow,<br />This movie has it all. Beautiful cast, lovely scenery, a very deep, taboo topic.<br />I watched this movie twice in order not to miss anything. You do have to pay close attention<br />there are a couple of areas where you might miss what is happening to other cast members.<br />Highly recommend this picture.
B00ANAC32U|5|An absolutely fantastic protection solution for the Nexus 4. Fits firmly around the outside of the phone. The volume and power buttons built into the case transition presses well to the phone. Adds a bit of bulk to the phone. While it can sometimes catch on the inside of the pocket it is not nearly as bad as a cheap silicon case. I have been using this case for almost a year and I attribute its use to my phone staying in excellent condition.
B0086700CM|5|I love this app I play it everyday and it is soooooo FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />temple run is my favorite app and it always will be!!!
B007SOQBCM|5|very good
B00IJJUIMY|5|Mr. Connelly stands up with the best. The book is about real cops and real politicians, good and bad. It's about trying to do the right thing when so many only want what helps them. Hurray for Harry.
B009KS4XRO|1|After several games you have to pay.  This then is not free. It was fun . I was unable to get any details after I read the tutorial
B00GUONXBI|4|I have played almost 30 levels and I don't see a reason to keep playing; I am on level 27 and I downloaded the app 5 minutes ago. Not that it is not fun and informative, it is just that it lacks the difficulty need to keep me interested for a longer amount of time.
B003VANOFY|4|Pro:  Great sound quality, easy to program the buttons (Used the drivers from logitech website), long battery life<br /><br />Con: A little big for my head, even on the smallest settings, and because of that can get a little uncomfortable during extended wear like I regularly do.  The usb receiver is also in the bigger side which is rather annoying for a laptop.<br /><br />All in all:  Great headset, would suggest to others and would buy again.  :)
1101946342|5|Exactly as described and arrived on date listed
B006LSZECO|4|This was a great read - right up until the end. I won't give anything away, but I will say I feel like the author was really excited and inspired with this novel until the last 10 pages, then it feels like he was just ready to be done. Books that end like that make the whole thing seem pointless. The last 10 pages gets 0 stars.
B000AU9UYM|5|16 years after Tim Burton stunned audiences and critics with his believable and dark motion picture version of Batman, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) has remade the movie with an even more believable premise and darker edge.     After Burton and Batman star Michael Keaton left the Batman series in 1992 with Batman Returns, the sequels got worse and ridiculous (Joel Schumacher literally destroyed the Batman installments with Batman Forever, with Val Kilmer as Batman, and Batman And Robin, with George Clooney turning Batman into a smiling dummy). Nolan succeeds in bringing back the seriousness of the original Batman, with Christian Bale (The Machinist) donning the bat suit this time around.     As the title prescribes, the film explores Bruce Wayne's gradual emergence into the dark caped superhero, and in the process resurrects the death of his rich and famous parents. The film then shows Bruce getting picked up and raised by the family's butler Alfred, played by Michael Caine (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), departing from Gotham to no man's land where he learns the skills of fighting on the hands of ninja warrior Ducard, played by Liam Neeson (Gangs Of New York), being initiated into but refusing to join a dark cult known as the League of Shadows led by Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), returning to a corrupt and crime-ridden Gotham city, reestablishing a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes, played by Katie Holmes, and vowing to bring back order to the city that his father help build, and in return got him killed, while in the process fight a relentless enemy known as The Scarecrow, played brilliantly by Cilian Murphy (Red Eye), with a little help from an honest detective named Jim Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace, JFK).     Nolan's directing never fails, while Bale's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman is only second best to, if not equal to, Michael Keaton's. Whether you agree with me or not, Batman Begins is destined to be a new beginning for yet another adventurous and exciting Batman franchise, just as long as Joel Schumacher stays away!     Recommended     A
0525953728|5|It looks interesting and I suggest everyone order it now.  I haven't read it, but you know they are going to do their best to block it, so it could be now or never.  I'm old enough to remember the controversy over \\"The Pentagon Papers,\\" and while they weren't able to block it then, it's a different Supreme Court with different ideas now.  I'm tempted to order about 10 copies so I'll have a collector's item to re-sell if it gets blocked!
B00OJ92MNQ|5|I rarely review games unless they are really really bad or very very good. And this game is awesome. Beautiful graphics. Challenging levels. For the people who complained it is too hard..I made it through every level and am now trying to get 3 stars on each one. One of my favorite games.
B005IGVYUG|5|If you're sick of hearing \\"the 1st Tom Waits album in 7 years\\", guess Bad As Me arrives right on schedule. That is if you don't count him emptying out the Orphanage a few years back. Maybe he breaks a mirror after every album & is just waiting for the bad luck to wear off.<br /><br />The album kicks off on the road with a manic Mr. Toad's wild ride to \\"Chicago\\". An open invitation to wrong side of the road, careening its way to the Big City, where all your dreams turn blue. Throughout this road trip Waits seems to throw the pages of any itinerary to the wind. His only destination seems to be to \\"Get Lost\\". From Bluesy barnstormers(\\"Raised Right Men\\") to after hours ballads (\\"Kiss Me\\"), fans from every phase of Waits' traveling sideshow will find something to take home here.<br /><br />\\"Hell Broke Luce\\" finds Waits in one helluva bad mood, putting you right in the middle of the war-zone in a song that would have been at home on 2004's Real Gone. But where Real Gone gave the piano a rest, Waits blows the dust off the ivories. For every hell raiser like \\"Luce\\", \\"Kiss Me\\" is a nod in the mirror back to the barfly balladeer of his Blue Valentine days. It's enough to make you stop and do a double take in slow motion.<br /><br />For all the criticism of his signature rusty pipes, the laid back falsetto croon he puts into \\"Talking at the Same Time\\" shows far more range than most fans and critics are willing to admit. \\"Pay Me\\" is Waits at his most tongue in cheek while  \\"Back In Crowd\\" is the sound of a heart quietly breaking at sunset, complete with a Mariachi band playing in the shadows.<br /><br />Throughout, Bad As Me also makes crystal clear just how integral guitarist Mark Ribot has been to Waits' sound since 1985's Rain Dogs. Some of his most subtle work can be heard on the eerie \\"Face to the Highway\\" while some of his most raucous is featured on the title track.<br /><br />Another guitarist that pops up here is a little known hack named, Keith Richards (nah, never heard of him either). Leave it to Keef to put an an alley cat strut into Satisfaction, a grumpy old man's answer to the Stones classic. At first glance, its a bit of a toss off, on second, a middle finger to mortality. Even more poignant is Keef's ghostly duet on the bittersweet, \\"Last Leaf\\".<br /><br />While welcome, am glad the bonus tracks are on a separate disc since they would lessen the impact of the overall album. But who doesn't want to hear what happens \\"After You Die?\\" That said, there's a real gem in \\"Tell Me\\". Not to knock \\"New Year's Eve\\", but perhaps it would have made for a more powerful ending.<br /><br />If Waits' last few proved a bit unwieldy for some, Bad As Me is Waits' most concise and accessible in years. As for this longtime eavesdropper, I can't stop placing my glass to the wall. The audio equivalent of a mighty fine scotch...At the end of a horrible deed...<br /><br />Hit me again, Tom...ard of him either).

B00GRHVIGU|5|I've always liked Croz and this new release just reinforces why.  What can I say that's not already been said many times over.  The man is a legend.  When I listen to Croz I'm into lyrics first then the music.  This is a worldly songwriter and the music on this CD supports the messages.  This has to be one of his best yet and like a good wine he improves with age.  The musicianship here is superb.  I just love the unexpected and the clarinets and trumpets coming in when least expected add to the intrigue.  His voice is as good as ever.  This isn't CSN and it's really not CPR but it's overall feel is much closer to the latter, likely due to the influences of his son, James Raymond.  This is an impressive new release that I find myself listening to over and over.  Keep em coming David.
B008J9EYFG|5|From the first curious listen, i was knocked out by the stripped, bare beauty of this album.<br />Gone are the electronic flourishes, that for me, sometimes distracted from the great music Beth<br />was creating.<br />Instead, Orton bares her soul with some of her most gorgeous vocal performances, and equally<br />riveting, sparse acoustic guitar arrangements.<br />In many ways, this record feels like a throwbook to the 60's and 70's, where ideas were more<br />free-flowing and engaging.<br />There is a strong folky, intimate feel to the material as well, in stellar songs like,<br />\\"State of Grace\\" and \\"Poison Tree.\\"<br /><br />Motherhood has done Beth good, judging by the maturity & craft of \\"Sugaring Season.\\"<br />Quite easily, her best work yet.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|This game should be for free plz make it for free
B003Q6D1YW|1|So obviously fake. Boring!

B0002Y69NG|5|This is a very cool collection to have if your a Matrix fan and it has everything you want to know about it.  [[ASIN:B0002Y69NG The Ultimate Matrix Collection (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions/ The Animatrix)]]
B00003CXSP|2|I saw Hannibal in the theatre after reading the book and enduring the months of hype that preceeded it. I was trying to be open-minded about it.  I loved Silence of the Lambs and easily consider it to be one of the all time classics in film making.  I was thoroughly disappointed.<br />There are so many things to dislike about this movie, even if you take it out of the Silence of the Lambs category.  Julianne Moore as Clarice...well, I'll give her credit...those are some awfully big shoes to fill and while I think she did try, her performance was flat and mediocre at best.  The book, in case you haven't read it, essentially turns all of the characters into side-show freaks and that couldn't be removed from the script which underwent massive re-writes right up until production.  Director Ridley Scott does manage to provide atmosphere to this film but that doesn't detract from the pitiful storyline.  <br />Gary Oldman plays the character of Mason Verger, whose only goal in life is to get revenge for what Hannibal did to him years before (which was basically remove his face).  Now, its says alot that Oldman's name doesn't appear in the credits...could it be embarrassment to be associated with this film?  Ray Liotta does a fair job of portraying the sexist, repulsive and crooked FBI agent, but the infamous dinner scene which was supposed to be scary and climatic falls flat and winds up being a joke. <br />Now, lets discuss Anthony Hopkins.  His portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs was a mixture of pure evil and pure genius.  His acting ability in that film was exceptional and frankly, it made everyone sit up and take notice.  He was creepy and scary and somehow endearing all at once.  He was subtle and over the top and man, did he make the most sinister and unforgettable character of all time.  And then there was Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal.  What happened?  Hannibal the Cannibal went from being scary and stylish to being old and perverted.  Phrases like\\"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti, fphhh fphhh fphhh\\" have now been replaced with \\"Okey dokey\\"  WHAT?!!  He wasn't scary or sinister at all...he was just a pitiful old man wandering around in a library half the time and pretending to be threatening.  I felt sorry for him one minute and disgusted the next.  I kept wanting to yell \\"KILL SOMEONE AND EAT THEIR LIVER OR SOMETHING.\\"  And the whole Hannibal vs. Clarice thing was transformed into something even sicker than liver-eating.  I kept waiting to see \\"Lector Loves Clarice\\" carved into a tree or something. It was far more fun to know that he respected her and felt the world was more interesting with her in it than this in-your-face twisted obsession.<br />Needless to say, I cannot recommend this film.  Please rent it before you shell out the cash for your own copy.  If you want to see a good, original and truly creepy film, buy Silence of the Lambs and leave this ... sequel on the shelf.
B00E8B1358|1|It was a terrible movie.  Kills off the hero of the first movie early to get him out of the way so &#34;The Rock&#34; and Bruce Willis will have no competition.
B000ICL3KG|1|Al Gore is just another out-of-work politician playing on the gullible public's heartstrings, while cheeerfully refusing to acknowledge \\"The Elephant In The Room.\\"    While it's true that humankind is doing things that slightly alter the environmental home of humanity, \\"The Elephant\\" that's being ignored is the correlation of POPULATION GROWTH as a mathematical curve-matching exercise.    The Industrial Age that \\"shows\\" a sudden growth of greenhouse gasses correlates closely with the-then advances in medicine that means MORE people today are living LONGER than did their ancestors.  World population is about 7.5 billion today; in 25 years it will have doubled unless Mother Nature or human greed destroys this population excess.
1586212222|3|I had a blast listening to the first story on my way to work.  I don't know what Sedaris looks like, but in my mind, he is Woody Allen's brother who has lost a bit of the NY accent.  Santa Land is so dang funny.<br />But, I was surprised at the depravity in some of the other stories --selling the twins to a molester, a the baby in the dryer, etc.  But ok, I probably didn't 'get it' is what I'm thinking.  So I wedged a lil more space in my brain, tried to be more open.  I guess Sedaris makes his points by using extremes.  Doesn't mean he condones it or that I, when listening to this, condone it. Just gives you another type of metaphor for what is really going on.  And once I made that leap, I liked it.

B003XF1XOQ|5|The hunger games series tops the latest series-twilight, divergent, and all the others geared towards teen to late 20s. Perfectly executed; no question left unanswered. Without giving away anything, I must say I wasn't happy with the closing of Gales story. Or Peetas for that matter. While everything was answered I would have liked for the author to take a little more time in polishing up a few stories. We spent three books learning about these people, I think it should've taken more than three pages to finalize them. Having said that, I am happy with the team I chose in the very beginning. Amazing and extremely sad book! But I am a sap for happy endings! 5stars- no question
B00005AREQ|5|JEFF BECK's best CD ever!! This is the first Jeff Beck music I heard and I was hooked! I love this CD and recommednd to anyone who love good guitar music.
B000YMM3CC|5|At the top of my list for the best movie ever! I have watched it over 20 times or more. It is the most talked about among all my friends, male and female. I have bought several DVD's only to give them to someone that has not seen the movie. Hence, The reason for ordering another one. I watch it each time as if I have never seen it before. Love Ryan Gosling!!

B00005JPLU|3|\\"300\\" is beautiful - each scene based on a panel from Frank Miller's comic series.  I caught a special screening in San Francisco 3 days before the official release.  It much more effective than Miller's other comic translated to film, \\"Sin City\\", because this film has both a heart and a meaningful message.  You can get a description of the plot elsewhere, so I will focus on the film's strength and weaknesses.  As I said above it is frame-by-frame beautiful - including every drop of splattered blood that flies across the screen.  You also feel the love and camaraderie of the soldiers to each other and Leonidas to his wife. And most importantly, their dedication to what is right versus what is easy.  With that said, there are some flaws that kept me from rating the film higher.  (1) David Wenham's voice-over narration is lack-luster - it really needed a voice that captivated you but instead you become aware of the stilted language; (2) Rodrigo Santoro's voice, as Xerxes, is heavily processed - I couldn't tell if he was dubbed with the voice of another actor (like Clinton Spilsbury in the \\"Legend of the Lone Ranger\\"); (3) Although Gerard Butler is overall good in the role of Leonidas, he grunts much of his dialogue as if he was constipated; (4) The makeup used for the hunchback is awful.  In the previews I thought he was computer-generated but instead the actor has a large bumpy plastic lump on his face and back - with all the wonder creative and computer artistry in the film, they couldn't have come up with a better design? With all the said, I still salute director Zack Snyder's effort and plan to see \\"300\\" at least one more time on the IMAX screen.
B004SJ3BCI|5|Wonderful! Great stress reducer.<br />Joyce
B000089RVX|5|First of all, I love Evanescence. Now that I said that, let's get down to the music.<br />Going Under- It's OK. Why it was released as a single, I don't know. 3/5<br />Bring Me To Life- This song got me hooked. 5/5<br />Everybody's Fool- The new single. 5/5<br />My Immortal- A tearjerker the first time you hear it. 5/5<br />Haunted- The goth influence is apparent on this song. 4/5<br />Tourniquet- Written by drummer Rocky Gray, it denounces suicide. It coulda done well on Christian radio. 5/5<br />Imaginary- Not bad, but not good either. I liked the old version of the song better. 4/5<br />Taking Over Me- It's being played on Christian radio, although not a single. I like it. 4/5<br />Hello- This song gives a lot of imagery. 5/5<br />My Last Breath- Just OK. 3/5<br />Whisper- Used to be great, but they had to change it. 4/5<br />Now, if you like &quot;Fallen&quot;, go and download (yes, download) &quot;Origin&quot;. You won't be disappointed.
B000OCXMAE|4|I am a real fan of heavy metal music. LP is usually not heavy metal, but as for this album...  i think they get a little closer. i can't beleive reading all of these other reveiws that all they are doing is trashing LP. Yeah... it is different, but it is not bad at all, in fact, in my opinion, i think is just as good as the previous 2 releases. it is way more chester, by that i mean... way more screaming. but all in all i like it... i usually don't write reveiws, but come on LP fans, don't be so hard 'em for trying something different... especially when it works.

0375842209|5|Brilliantly written, and touching to the emotions. Although there were a few slower parts here and there, still a heart-warming read. It shows how the innocence of youth can survive through the evil in the world, and Zusak has a unique way in presenting it. Caught me in after a little focus. Superb. A masterpiece if you have the patience.
B00DUGCLY4|5|I love this game it is the best game EVER
B00BEJ5O6Q|5|Excellent CD from Blake as usual.  This is a wonderful CD. He is a true performer.  He aced it great performer.
B004JN1CW4|4|I have to say that I am pleased with how this series ended.  Yes, there are some lingering questions that I have, and I wish he had spent more time on certain characters instead of relying on the action of our main group of characters fighting their way out of one bad situation to the next to propel the story along.  But I still found this book just as compelling to read as the previous two and the ending was satisfying.
B00005JNTV|5|It's about time we get another movie worthy to add to the DVD collection.

6302732778|5|Walking home from class one day I pass by my local video rental store.  As luck would have it, it was the first day they were selling off their VHS library.  Curious, I step inside and browse around until I spot a title I've heard before but never really bothered checking out: Blade Runner the Director's Cut.  The combination of a futuristic film noir (two of my favorite genres) and one inspiration to Cowboy Bebop (one of my favorite series)? I decide to part with the 8 dollars.    Before watching the film I feel the need to find out a little more about my version.  Upon checking the reviews I run into a little debate over the better or best version.  As I understand (and to boil things down), the original version was the \\"Hollywood (forced/ feel good)\\" cut verses Mr. Scott's \\"own vision\\".  In addition, the DVD Director's cut is a 1st generation release (i.e. distracting/poor transfer quality).  So how was the VHS Director's Cut? Amazing.    From start to finish the film transports us into the gritty streets of a semi-advanced LA, planted in the classic 80's style.  The characters, driven through dimly lit environments and circumstances play very well together- from the decadent nightclubs to a monolithic corporation to apartment housing that mid 20th century forgot.  The music also fuses nicely, between jazz of a contemporary detective mystery and an 80's electronic orchestra, creating the synthesized trumpet that pulls me deeper into the night's chase.  And the performances? (You can read the product description for story) Well, without giving anything away, acting is never excessive, while subdued much of the time- as it needs to be.  It was those moments during the journeys, in between the confrontations that allowed time for the main characters to develop.  When sides did meet, the action was also very believable (like the settings).  In summary, the deliveries only built up until a great finish with an inspiring message to boot.       While that sale went on Ialso picked up a few other 80's VHS classics:    *Arcadia of my Youth- English Subtitled   Classic from the creator of Interstella 5555(which also has a certain dream-like quality).  'Arcadia' also has a strong positive message it wants to convey.      *Highlander- Original Cut(Heard director's cut is over explanitory.)  Another 80's fantastic adventure.    *Legend of Drunken Master II- English Subtitled (The complete version)  Early 90's but close enough.  For those who want more action and less plot. Jackie Chan in his prime...I'll check out 'Police Story' afterwards.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Im just reviewing for the crystals but so far I'm loving this game its challenging and the objects move everytimr so you actually have to look for them instead of memorizing where they are
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is so much fun, I can't put my kindle down.
0062255657|4|The book packs a wallop. The lead character starts and ends the story as a middle-aged man, but a bulk of the story takes place when he’s a boy in Sussex, England. There are witches and evil things and grown-ups who disappoint. Gaiman has a gift with making a story seem simple when it’s not. He also knows how to keep a reader on the edge of their seat. This book is extra special to me because it’s autographed by the author. I had the incredible pleasure of attending the Ann Arbor, Michigan stop of his final book signing tour.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|Yes, I admit that I'm caught up in the Frozen phenom. While it is similar to other match-3 games I've played, the Frozen characters add a little whimsy and make it fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Not too long ago I finally bought a patch cord to hook up my laptop to our TV for watching videos, NetFlix, etc. but it was always a pain to get up to pause it when the phone rang, the doorbell rang, or when nature called. Anyway, using Google Chromecast is a breeze, it works fantastically, and you can control everything from your laptop ... which as the name would have it, is often right in your lap.<br /><br />Buy it - you'll love it.
B001DHXT1G|4|I have to say neither the movie or the actors were bad if at all the actors portraying the characters did incredibly well but this movie just for some reason did not keep my attention unlike the X-men movies.  If you've read the comics for the early years of the Hulk Bruce Banner was hunted like this by the government to use him and how Bruce tries to contain or control his Hulk Persona and I like that the movie shows the same thing.  I can't say if it's either because I've read the comics or just wanted to see the big fight between Hulk and Abomination but I found myself wanting to skip through the scenes in between the Hulk scenes and the final fight.  But if you haven't read the comics or seen the first Hulk Movie I do advise not skipping the scenes otherwise you will become confused on what is happening.  The video and audio for the blu-ray version are incredible nicely detailed and sharp and hearing the effects are astounding.  So I say while the movie doesn't reach the level of the X-men movies I put it in the same rank as Iron Man or the Fantastic Four movies.  So if you like the comic book movies this one is a good choice for you....
B007N31YH0|5|One of the best movies ever!  Nothing beats the Newman/Redford team and this movie is entertaining from beginning to end.  Gotta watch it more than once to catch everything.
B0028IDXDS|4|Aside from the fact that the stuffed toy is sewn onto the pacifier it's great for my 3 month old the paci doesn't bounce all over when he spits it out and he can put it back into his own mouth it's easy to find since it really can't fall behind him when he is in a swing or bouncy seat! Plus it's really cute. Wish it could detach from the paci just for better cleaning
B00IX9UTLU|3|Maybe I had higher expectations because of all the high reviews, but I felt let down. It was just an okay read, nothing too special, but for the price ( I paid .99), it was a decent read and I did keep turning the pages. Mostly a page turner because I figured out every “surprise” before it was reveled and I wanted to see if I was right. Even the big one in the third book I figured out somewhere during the second book. So no big surprises, I think the author gives away too much, instead of looking back in hindsight and thinking 'ahh, makes sense', you’re easily able to figure things out ahead of time. There were also holes in the story, since I read each book right after the other, there were times I stopped & thought, wait I thought this was said from book one, and now it’s changed!?!<br />The storyline seems like a really interesting one, and the plot seemed like a great idea, but it does have lots of weak places, and could have been so much better. It also reminded me A LOT of the Fifty Shades trilogy, she even references it once. Except in this the heroine, Alayna (or Lainie) was more annoying. I think it might have been because of her addiction, I have no baseline for stalking & addiction, so I couldn’t connect easily with her, and the author does a poor job of connecting us. She was really annoying at times and I had to tell myself it’s because of her addictions that I don’t get it and just go with it, but it just became too much after a while. The hero, Hudson, was kinda vague, his choices didn’t fit, he’d say one thing and do another, and he didn’t really seem to change or grow much! Obviously he did, or there’d be no happy ending, but it was off, sorry it’s hard to explain; it was hard to believe and connect with him too.<br />It is an explicit romance novel, and many sex scenes were well done, but some scenes just seemed to be thrown in there and it interrupted the story a few times. After awhile some of the scenes got boring and I found myself skipping through. I also started skipping through the third book because conversations/internal monologue/actions became repetitive, and since I figured out what was going to happen I became more interested in seeing if I was right.<br />Not the worst, not the best I’ve read. It was an okay way to pass the time, so I’d only recommend if you go in with low expectations and if the price stays low.ound myself skipping through.

B0017ZB8M6|2|There are three reasons to buy this album, \\"Hot & Cold,\\" \\"I Kissed a Girl,\\" and \\"U R So Gay.\\"  The rest is god awful.      This album recycles every stereotype there is to \\"empowered\\" girl music.  Most of the songs are overproduced, which would be fine if there was something of substance there (Phil Specter overproduced everything, but when the underlying band was good, the result was great).  I really wanted to like this album, but that just wasn't possible.
B006VREHRS|5|I'm hooked. Great show.
B00011CZRE|5|\\"Seven\\" is one of those movies I enjoyed thoroughly from start to finish. And yet I wandered around in gloom the rest of the day.<br /><br />This is a movie filled with vivid death and mounting mystery. The premise is brilliant and the acting superb. A twisted killer is afoot and he is slicing, dicing, overfeeding, and generally having a great old time offing people in accordance with the seven deadly sins. The victims become stark symbols of man's greed, lust, envy, gluttony and so on. It's a brilliant mind that conceives of such a blueprint of death, and it's that brilliant mind that makes him so difficult to catch. Unless, of course, he wants to be caught.<br /><br />The movie is gory and violent and those things are wonderful for your film going experience. What gets you is the low lighing, the constant rain, the dolorous music. David Fincher wants you to feel gloomy and he achieves this. Throw in a nasty, jarring ending and you'll wander away from this movie feeling like somebody tortured and killed your dog.<br /><br />I mean that in a good way. A must see movie.
0307346617|5|Its easy to love a book that is already popular, because so many other people have already vetted it for you, though I think that WWZ stands above the pack because even if it was a small press offering I think it would still have exploded. Its that good. I loved the multitude of perspectives used in the approach to a global zombie apocalypse, which made WWZ and fantastic complementary text to the author's first book (The Zombie Survival Guide) which of course had the cut & dry textbook style. I believe that this is a unique approach to zombie fiction that clearly establishes his works as foundations for the ever-expanding zombie fiction genre. While many other stories/novels will center on a small group of characters (or just one) and take them through adventure after adventure, trial after trail, and while I love those books also, WWZ (and the survival guide) have a subtext of realism that sets them apart. It truly does feel more like journalism and textbook writing than fiction, regardless of the fact that we all know we are reading fiction. With a healthy suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader these books (esp WWZ) carry an undertone of real-world terror that so many other works of fiction simply cannot convey because they are indeed written as fiction. Yes I know I'm getting all 'meta' with this review, but that is the chief strongpoint of the work (in addition to just being a great book) and the reason for me giving it 5 stars.
B00FSBW2L6|5|Wow! This third installment goes like lightning - we meet a whole new generation and a diverse cast of characters. This one is possibly my favorite book of the trilogy, because of the many new people I met and how involved I got in their issues. It's hard to say though...I love them all.<br /><br />If you've not followed The Three Nations trilogy up until now, don't worry. you can waltz right into this book, meet the new families, and feel right at home in The Black Eagle Inn. Trust me, you'll love the people you meet. That's because Christoph Fischer has a wonderful way of getting inside characters' heads...and there are plenty of characters in this book. :) It takes a unique talent to conjure up so much empathy for so many viewpoints. I can't get enough of these books. What's next, Mr. Fischer?<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to adults and mature YA.
1400095204|4|wonderful story; had me engrossed all the way

B00FFBPAKE|3|I returned my first order because the print was so small.  This print is pretty small too but overall this particular collection was worth the money as it was so reasonably priced.
B00881VLCE|3|Great puzzles, pictures are so clear, fun to relax with my Kindle Fire.

Did not do this before, not sure it this will be fixed.
B008602KQI|3|I chose this rating because while the idea does have some historical precedence for possibly happening, it is still pretty far out into fantasy land. Some of the things they did seem contrived. But it was good acting and entertaing.
B003MOHX8S|5|This was the first soundtrack I bought from Two Steps From Hell.<br /><br />Needless to say, they made me a fan for life.<br /><br />Oh, you want to know why?<br /><br />The music is very epic and gets your imagination going. If you want to get your blood pumping or you want to put this as background music to your fighting game, or you want to have music for an inspirational video of determination. This is the perfect for that task.<br /><br />I mean, you've even heard this sound track in video game trailers like Mass Effect 2 and I think Archangel made an appearance in 3. Just wonderful, epic, instrumental music. These guys are one of the best.
B009OCR1X4|5|I got this music because I love it in the DVD and at the Theater when I first saw it.  The music score is very lifting.<br />I would recommend this to anyone that love the new music being written for movies of this caliber.
B006O5XYWG|5|Great movie. Brings the issue of animal cruelty perpetrated by scientists to the public's attention.  Makes you empathize with Caesar for the horrible treatment he receives at the hands of a so-called shelter.

0060591714|3|La segunda parte de las Memorias del &aacute;guila y el jaguar es menos emocionante que su predecesora y aunque el mensaje ecol&oacute;gico y anti tecnol&oacute;gico sigue presente, la prosa de este libro se siente menos pulida. La aventura esta ahi, pero esta ves Allende intenta hacer una especie de thriller al estilo Dan Brown que hace que el relato desmerezca junto a La ciudad de las Bestias.

B000J103X4|3|While most rappers seem to love having feuds with each other, they usually don't want to have them with people under their own label. But that's exactly what happened with The Game. After his debut album The Documentary was released, tension mounted between him and the group he was apart of, G-Unit, and more specifically, its leader 50 Cent. The back and forth bickering led to The Game leaving the group, and taking stabs at them whenever he could. Dr. Dre, who worked with all the men involved, was supposed to help produce The Game's second album. However, while he never chose either side, he backed out of The Game's album after all the drama ensued. Despite that, The Game kept the original Dre inspired title for his sophomore album, Doctor's Advocate.<br /><br />Despite Dr. Dre's absence from the album, he certainly lives on in spirit. Not only does the album's title reference Dre, but his name is mentioned on nearly every single track on the album. For anyone not familiar with the back story behind it (and even for some people that are), this might become really annoying, really quickly. When he's not name dropping, The Game's ego is on full display, as most of the tracks he spends his time boasting about his talents, his money, and his women. Basically, just the typical far of most rap albums nowadays. Fortunately, the beats are very good almost all the way through, which means the constant boasting go down much easier. Some highlights on the album are Let's Ride, Too Much (featuring Nate Dogg), and Wouldn't Get Far (featuring Kanye West). The most interesting track on the album is the title track, which features Busta Rhyme. The track is basically an open letter confessional to Dr. Dre, apologizing to him for not taking his advice, and thanking him for being like a father to him. Busta also speaks to Dre, telling him that he's trying to help The Game by giving him advice as well. It's the only track that The Game really deviates from the usual fare, and seems to let his guard down and really let his true feelings show.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty good album. If you were a fan of his debut, you should really enjoy his album quite a bit. Despite the constant mentioning of Dr. Dre, and the constant boasting, there are quite a few infectious beats on the album that will keep you rocking your head for awhile.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5to let his guard down and really let his true feelings show.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a pretty good album.

B003YWUTJI|5|I have always appreciated Norah Jones and her music, but this new album blew me away.  All the collaborations on the album are different & show the many sides of Norah and her talent.  One of my favorite songs was \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" performed with Willie Nelson because I love, love, love Christmas music & their voices sounds amazing together.  \\"Virginia Moon\\" with the Foo Fighters and \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton are another couple of my favorites.  She also performs with rap, hip-hop & jazz artists, completely showing her range in music and performing.  Each song is an effortless duet, it never sounds like it actually took them work to perform together.  I would recommend this new album to anyone who likes the relaxing sound of Norah Jones, you will not regret this purchase.
B00JL6L4UY|5|This Joel Kinnaman can act. A cool death dealing Cyborg if you ask me. Great movie. Waiting for RoboCop II if they make one. I loved it.
B00CWY76CC|5|I love this game it is soo fun to hunt for stuff to open the elevator and go to the next level and it gets harder every level I'm stuck on level 10
140053271X|5|For a user who only want's the basics, this is perfect. It's very simple and easy to use and it's small enough to carry in a purse, I just love it. You will keep your books forever which is my favorite part.
B002QS5OQ4|2|8 episodes in and I haven't stayed awake for a whole one yet. If you like SG-1 and Atlantis, well, this ain't them. It's very - VERY - somber (so far, none of the lightheartedness that made the serious events of the other two series so watchable).
B00005O3VC|5|Classic!
B004XDYJRU|4|this app is awesome. it does have the occasional force close if you try to use SoundHound to tag a song you like.  HTC EVO
B007JCP8FE|5|Absolutley great cd from beginning to end.  If you love Shinedown then you will love Amaryllis.  Can't wait for their next one!
B009WO7NQO|5|I love angry birds...they have outdone themselves with this addition...I can't wait to see what the creators of Angry Birds comes up with next :)

B000031XCR|5|I am of French Canadian Ancestry (South Louisiana) &amp; on a recent trip to Montreal I came to know what a love affair Quebec has with this Lady. They have every right to be proud, she is not only a heart &amp; SOUL  songstress, but a caring individual with alot of class &amp; ability. The  Cd is incredibly good!
B00DV2D0JC|5|Clear graphics, interesting puzzles, HO zoom, map, diary, in app guide and tagged inventory combine to make this game professional.  Awesome length and rather intriguing story make it a pleasure to play.
B006885FZI|4|The first nine episodes were mostly excellent. Episode 10 was pretty rushed to conclude the story
0143113100|5|I am still reading this book but am well into the 2nd half.  Very good reading, amazing discoveries.  I am trying out some of what I have read to see if I can get my leg working again.   Time will tell, also patience and endurance.
B003JTHXOK|5|Its an amazing story that i ever read. Its like in a real life that makes me excite and nervous at the same time. Two thumbs up for Nicholas Sparks.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is so cool and I do not know what to say that I am not r going to the game was a little while longer
B00DUGCLY4|5|ok I need help with one its a airplane and a letter plz help and I love the game.it is just so fun
0441009425|4|This is the first of Reynold's novels I have read.  Overall I would say I liked it.  It's an intriguing story, with the hallmarks of so-called hard science space opera.  I recommend it.<br /><br />However, his writing was a bit purple alot of the time.  Excessively flowery, with chracter dialogue being both unrealistic and - yes - operatic!<br /><br />But it began well, ended well and I am going to hunt down other works of his.
B00030590I|4|After reading a few reviews for this movie I thought it was gonna be huge, epic battles.  Wrong.  There are some great battle scenes and the colors and images are breathtaking.  But, this movie is more of a love story than a war story.  I liked the way it was told, although it will probably confuse some people.  Jet Li is a great actor/martial artist/stunt coordinater/producer.  The other actors are good too.   <br /> <br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is probably the hype.  While all the battle scenes are great, for me, they ended up ending too soon.  I also wasn't expecting the complex story, which I liked, but there were just a few too many twists and turns thrown in.   <br /> <br />Overall if you want to see a good martial arts/romance/historical   <br />piece then you should see this.  Its a good movie to be sure, a bit confusing, but a good film none the less...
B0037RDPEG|5|good reading  entertaining  ...but I didnot like very much the ending  I have yet to see the movie
B003XF1XOQ|5|Easy to read. Non-stop thrills. Epic love and tragedy.This book is one I didn't want to put down from the minute I picked it up.
B0000DJZA5|1|I'm a big Beatles fan.  Let It Be was originally intended to be a live concert album, but that never happened.  Eventually Phil Spector was brought in and he produced the original Let It Be album.  Sir Paul, however, was never happy with Phil Spector's work.  As a result, we now have Let It Be... Naked.  If you loved the original, Naked will probably let you down.  All of the fun of the original album has been digitally removed from Naked.  Naked is devoid of feeling.  It does not have the edge of the original.  Naked hiccups.  It starts and stops.  It doesn't flow.  Naked takes a set of classic Beatles songs and digitally neuters them.  Digital technology is very powerful.  It turned a great \\"live\\" album into a mediocre studio album.  [...]  Why go to all the trouble to digitally sterilize that sound?  And what's up with the reverb?  Half the time Paul sounds like he's singing in the shower.  Personally, I don't like all the strings on the original \\"Long and Winding Road\\" track and the loud guitar solo on the original \\"Let It Be\\" track bugs me.  I think the best versions of those songs can be found on Anthology 3 (and Paul hadn't even written all the words to Let It Be when he sang the version on   Anthology 3).  Naked did not improve on those tracks at all.  I did, however, like the fact that Naked includes John's \\"Don't Let Me Down.\\"  But, again, a live song that has been digitally neutered.  Bottom line... Naked has no balls.
B00687Q0VC|4|Was a very good protrayal of his life with Abyigal. Seemed to gloss over the relationship with his children especially since John Quincy became President.<br />His lack of participation in drafting the Constitution was barely touched on which had an impact on his troubles as President. The story seemed to loose focus during his presidency and his later life. A case again of the book being better than the movie.
B006PHD0RW|5|I'm very picky as to game apps and absolutely love this one. Tetris fans will love it. Obsessed with getting 3 stars on all levels.
B009UX2YAC|5|its so much fun. but if anybody can help me please do because i cant upgrade it. i do love it.
B00IUBXPEY|5|We loved this movie!!! Ready for the next installment! Great action and plot twists! This one was as good ad the first!!
B008602KQI|5|Movie was great! Better than I expected. Bring an amazon prime member is pretty awesome. You get the best in everything. I would definitely watch it again and is waiting for the next one to come out in theaters!
B00E25KVLW|5|A really good introduction into Rails 4. Lots of usable examples and very readable even if you have limited programming experience.  The books guides you from a noob in Rails to a beginner understanding the concepts and taking away the first annoyances to usually occur when studying new technologies.<br /><br />The thing I like best is that after finishing the book you can write basic applications and especially you're ready (motivated) for learning new things about Rails as it shows you clearly how powerful it is!
B001U5V04O|2|Very disappointed of the sound. When I buy a pricey Blu-Ray disc from Opus Arte I expect exceptional sound quality. That is not the case with this disc. Regrettably anything else from the production to the singers becomes kind of irrelevant without good sound. The overture started very good. The orchestra is vibrant and with full sound. But once the singers appear you start looking for the sound, looking for anything wrong with the audio systems. The problem is the disc itself. What a pity!  (please see comments for updates)
B008Z9YGEE|5|The story line was like nothing I've ever seen before. They followed the book to the T. Loved the actors and settings. Part two Catching Fire was just as amazing. Hopefully the third move will be just as great. I love Jennifer Lawrence in this role. I loe her as Mysti in X men also. She needs more dialogue in the Xmen series. She can really kick ass. should have been and I think was voted best movie of the year.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Good

006197806X|4|After surviving the events of [[ASIN:0061726834 Delirium]], Lena is thrust into the Wilds. Alternating between her beginnings in the Wilds and her current ventures as a part of the Resistance, it's easy to see that Lena has been shattered, pieced together again, and rebuilt into a young woman that is slowly finding her strength and her purpose in a very hectic society. But nothing is easy, nothing is what it seems, and not everyone can be trusted in Lena's world.<br /><br />If you thought the first novel ripped your heart out and stomped on it by the time you reached the breathtaking conclusion, just wait until you read Pandemonium. I'm going to keep quiet about the plot points (and trust when I say that you want to go into this novel knowing nothing). The pacing starts with an excited rush, and that tension never quite dissipates. Instead, the tension lingers, building and receding until the exhilarating conclusion finally arrives. My eyes were locked onto that final page, and I was silently cursing the fact that I don't have the third novel, Requiem. Pandemonium is chaotic and compelling. You'll never want to tear your eyes away once you begin reading.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: Pandemonium pulled me in and twisted my emotions around as I followed Lena through her dangerous journey. Lena's world is more fully discovered and developed. Alternating chapters (Now and Then) provided a full view of Lena - Seeing her in both ways was fascinating: from a broken and fragile girl to a strong, determined young woman. All in all, a strong sequel.<br /><br />LOWLIGHTS: Too short of story (especially for Lauren Oliver), so sometimes things felt like they were happening too fast. I was able to figure out all of the surprises before they happened (I tend to predict plot \\"surprises\\" easily, though). I wasn't fond of the romantic relationship Lena begins to build - I somewhat grew to like him, but not enough to believe in their relationship.<br /><br />RATING: 4.5 out of 5
B000HF0J36|4|One of my all time favorite shark horror movies. The action is what is to be expected but the ending has a nice twist from the expected. Plus who can go wrong with LL Cool J fighting sharks?!
B003ASLJO0|5|Synopsis: Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bitter, aging Archie Bunker-like Korean War veteran and widower who seems to hate just about everybody and everything. That is with the exception of his '72 Gran Torino. When he finds himself pulled into a gang related situation terrorizing his Asian neighbors he finds himself invested and connected to others for the first time since the death of his wife and reevaluates his life and what he should do to better things for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Critique: 'Gran Torino' is a hard hitting contemporary drama that mirrors many of the attitudes and social problems plaquing American urban society; loneliness, ignorance, racism, uninvolvement, hostility and gang violence to name a few. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his best film performances (my personal favorite is 'Pale Rider'). The dialogue is sharp and bitting, the storyline edgy and contemporary and the acting is honest and believable. This is hard-hitting cinema that is both enjoyable and meaningful. Recommended viewing.
B00H58VGIA|5|I loved it! I was sucked in, and couldn't put it down. It felt very similar to &#34;The Kitchen House&#34;, but I loved that book too.
B005LAIHXQ|5|This movie sheds so much light onto the movie ALIEN that was released in 1979.  Not as scary, as the original.  (Gross and graphic displays have been around for quite a while.)  But, Alien fans should enjoy this.  Sorry, no Ripley in this one.  The timeline is in the late 21st century.  But, it's not clearly apparent if it's pre-Riply or post-Ripley.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This is the greatest invention since the last greatest invention.  It does what it says.  Syncs up to your computer and then every program you want to watch on your computer, a little box gives you the option of playing it on your TV.  I particularly like that I can watch You Tube movies.  There is such a variety and this is the only reliable way I have found to watch.  Many TVs offer You Tube as a WIfi option but they usually break up, stop etc.  I never had this problem with Chromecast.
B00005JL78|5|This movie has it all...special effects, action, drama, thriller, who done it, suspense and futuristic scenery and ideas. There's probably more, but I just couldn't think of 'em all right now. GREAT MOVIE!
B00008S2VG|2|Moledonna sings like she has a bad case of Diarrhea. I recommend a dose of immodium and a permanent break from putting out substandard garbage like this.
B002N14GPE|5|This movie actually surprised me. It was a good horror film from 2009. It managed to make me jump a few times. Twisted ending didn't see coming
B007MDB71O|5|I must say, I only went to see this because of a love for classic science fiction and fully expected a lame treatment by Disney. Suffice it to say, that only Disney's marketing was lame - the movie was extremely enjoyable and well-done - very original, with very thought-out direction. I want to see more!
B0081L37Z0|5|So clever and fun.  I watched it 3 times! (not 3 times from Amazon, but just in general.)
B005ELZMH6|5|This CD really rocks an  d it rolls.  I have no favorites, that's how good it is.  My favorite music store, the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis, never heard of it.  That makes this very obscure, if you know the Fetus.  Has a lot of rock-a-bility, no mess'n about bolt you to the chair music that begs for volume.  Be the 1st on the block, to bring that CD home in a box!  Wikki-Wikki.
B00881VLCE|5|This is a awesome game,it keeps me occupied when I'm board or need to get in my happy place I RATE ALL STARS DUHH
0802473156|3|The best parts of this book are the last pages of each chapter. They list several types of love acts you can show to someone of a particular love language. That has been great inspiration! The information in the book is good, but I've felt while reading it that some stories/information could be cut or shortened and I'd appreciate more &#34;meat.&#34; It's helpful to hear about others experiences, but it seems that 50-60% of the book is a story of one couple or another in their own specific situation. Overall, I appreciated taking his love language quiz more than this book, but this isn't a waste of time to try if you're wanting a little more explanation and some good ideas.
B00DPM7RJW|5|I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book.  As anxious as I was to read this, I couldn’t bring myself to start it at midnight of its release date when I got my eBook copy.  Having read all of Colleen Hoover’s books, I have some knowledge of how she writes.  And knowing what Colleen’s books does to me and my heart, I knew I would be in for one hell of read.  But nothing could have prepared me for what was in store.  I’ve read the ARC reviews and I’ve even gone to iTunes to read the sneak peek of the prologue and first chapter.  I thought, well, no one has said anything bad about it, and the sneak peek definitely left me wanting more.  But there was one thing that constantly stood out in the reviews that was the cause of my apprehension, and that was that the story has a love triangle.  I do not like love triangles.  Still, it’s Colleen butterflying Hoover!  I can’t not read it!  I love Colleen Hoover.  As many books as I have on my to-read-list, she is one of the few authors that I would immediately buy new books from, and I would devour the book in 1-2 days.<br /><br />Not even 5% into the story and I’m hooked.  14% in and I get blown away.  I don’t know how Colleen does it.  I’ve read every single one of her books starting with Hopeless, and every single time I’m blown away.  I call Hopeless my “gateway drug” to Colleen’s magical works. I say magical because she literally takes words, scrambles them up, puts them together, and creates an absolute masterpiece.  To me, Hopeless will always be my absolute favorite because it’s the very first book of hers that I read and loved.  But I think Maybe Someday is her greatest masterpiece yet!  She is the first to tackle this...I don’t even know what to call it!  Is there even a word that could describe this new type of genius?  I mean, the book has a soundtrack!  And what an amazing soundtrack at that!<br /><br />But going back on the love triangle issue, love triangles are always tough to read.  They’re either very predictable or completely unpredictable until you get to a certain point in the story, you end up hating one or two of the main characters, and/or one of main characters in the love triangle conveniently leaves the story in some way or another to give you the HEA.<br /><br />The love triangle in this story is not one you would expect.  I connected with the story and to each and every one of the main characters; I felt everything they felt. You absolutely can’t hate any of them.  As much as you want to hate any of them to make it easier for your heart, Colleen makes it very tough for you to.  They are all genuinely good people!  Even coming from jacked up childhoods, they didn’t let it define who they were and they sure as hell didn’t let it affect the person they chose to be.<br /><br />“I don’t go around blaming my parents for everything…they’re better than most, just worst than some. I hate it when people spend their entire lives blaming their parents for every bad thing that happens to them.”<br /><br />But still, they make some pretty bad choices that makes you question how good they really are sometimes, but who doesn’t make bad decisions every now and then?  That’s another thing that I love about this story is that it’s believable.  What’s more is that the supporting characters are unforgettable and there’s plenty of comic relief.<br /><br />Be prepared because this book will tear your heart to pieces, in good ways and in bad.  But no matter how the story ends, it’s hard to feel bad for any of the characters.  They are all very mature and very responsible adults.  They own up to their mistakes and they’re open to a fault that it makes it tough for you to feel pity for any of them at all.  There’s a twist in the story and it doesn’t happen where you expect it.  And don’t worry, you still get your happy ending.  Just make sure you read the epilogue on the Maybe Someday website ([...]) after youfinish reading the book.  You’ll need the last word of the last chapter in order to access it, and I would highly recommend that you refrain from reading it until after you read the book.  Or else, it will definitely spoil the whole story for you.<br /><br />This story…it makes me feel like Colleen is letting everyone in on the secrets of the heart.  The heart.  Oh, the heart.  One little organ. A thousand different feelings.  Bad heart.  Bad bad bad heart.<br /><br />This book, the accompanying songs, the words, the lyrics, the author, the musician: brilliant.  Sheer brilliance.t word of the last chapter in order to access it, and I would highly recommend that you refrain from reading it until after you read the book.

0345472322|1|This book is identical to Dweck's 2006 book \\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.\\" If you own or have read that book, there's no need to get this one.<br /><br />It strikes me as basically dishonest to market this book as a different title, as Amazon does. For example: Amazon offers to bundle these two books (with a third) for a discount price--the obvious implication being that they are not the same book.<br /><br />The book itself is fine (I'd rate it a 4 stars by itself), but the misleading information prompts this review.
B00AMUOP22|4|I love this song!  It's just too bad it doesn't have remixes.  It's very difficult to find maxi singles in this digital age.  I'm still a firm believer in purchasing cds still.  There's nothing like having your own, &#34;physical,&#34; library at home and compiling your own files or cds for your listening pleasure!
B00HYTT7BI|5|Once again, Tom Hanks gave a stellar performance.  The move was fast paced with never a slow moment.  Tom Hanks portrayed a remarkable human being in Captain Phillips.
