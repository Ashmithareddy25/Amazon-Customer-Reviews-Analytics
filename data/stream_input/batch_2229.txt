B005GFPZYK|4.0|I enjoyed the look inside the mind of a sniper and also enjoyed the fresh no bs  attitude of the Seals. it's too bad the people in charge are more worried about political correctness than kicking ass and winning. You don't send our guys over there with their hands tied. That's idiotic.
0988178532|5.0|\\"Circumstances define the man. No one wakes up and decides to be great. It's the events they're thrown into that determine if they are truly great. Survive or not is to be great or not.\\" --Outview<br /><br />We can learn a lot from this boy Nate who is thrown into a crash course on everything he needs to learn about the life he is living and about his soul's quest from lifetime to lifetime.<br /><br />Outview has a lot to offer.  There is a thrilling coming of age plot as Nate and his friends learn their destiny and, with no other choice, dive head first into it.  There is an underlying theme that grounds us in our relationships with Mother Earth and Mother Nature.  And then there is this wonderful exercise for your imagination as you follow the hero through his journey.  Pages turn quickly as the reader jumps from one surprise to the next!<br /><br />I closed book one very excited to start book two!  I hope to see it on Amazon soon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is great for those who liked the \\"Fifty Shades\\" books but were a little uncomfortable with more physically painful aspects of what Christian was into (e.g. nipple clamps, lashes, anal plugs). Just as hot, but more of a Plain Vanilla flavor.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban has and is always a wonderful entertainer.  He has vocal versatility which is even more wonderful when he sings in a foreign langusage.
B00136JR2M|5.0|If you want to hear pure hip hop energy from the heart of the hood itself, plug into this album. Genius level beats and rhymes. AWESOME!!!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great price!! great flick! I will be sure to tell all my friends about this great deal! Thank You Puddles
B005LAII0I|5.0|I love this take on Snow White.  It may be a kid's movie, but it is still good for adults.
0696204800|5.0|It for a beginner or advance quilter. I've so many ideas and quilts I want to make from this book.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Leave me alone. It was a good book. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Like the quick access to mail, but upon sending emails it began sending to outbox, could never recall from outbox, it would be working to load  from outbox but nevercompleted the download.  For that reason could never clear outbox, just kept adding everytime I would send.  Several emails just vanished into the cloud? I just don't like being hamstrung by idiosyncrasies of any system and deleted with extreme prejudice.  Back to the old login on Yahoo, slower but seems to always work.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|You have to pay to get the whole app.<br />It is very fun otherwise, though. I like the storyline. Wish I could keep playing.
B0054NQYPS|2.0|I rented this movie based on the preview looking like this was an inspiring movie with all-star actors.  Well, one out of 2.  Actors were great, but the movie was just so depressing and only started to look like there was hope in the last 15 min of the movie.  Even that was just 'meh'.  This would be a good movie if you were in an economics class and just wanted to understand the impact that period had on the uber-wealthy.  Otherwise, skip it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is the best one of the series, in my opinion.  Kronos has got his army and is going to attack Olympus and kill everyone.  There is also another problem for the God's to handle. The giant typhon has risen from the mountain and plans on destroying Olympus and all the gods.  It is up to Percy Jackson and his friends to save the world from being destroyed.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|just the right movie i love this version.  keira knightley and matthew macfadyen have magic and it shines. donald sutherland does an outstanding job in his role as do all the actors and actresses. this is the best version.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|They crammed a dozen episodes into ten.  Most folks are missing that point.<br /><br />What more can be said?<br /><br />I read books one and two. I've bought both series and other books about the series/ world of Fire and Ice.  I was a fan until now.<br /><br />Great actors.  Great scenery.  Great sets.  Nice music.<br /><br />Screen play for series two seemed like it was written by committee. I constantly felt like I was watching a movie trailer that happened to be about an hour long.<br /><br />I'm ok with the violence.  It was \\"realistic\\" after all.<br /><br />The sadistic/ masochistic scenes SUCK.  We have enough senseless violence against women in our world without having to have more of it on our television screens.<br /><br />Useless scenes not in book 2 (the sadistic beating of that woman while Joffrey watched is one) were added when important scenes were left out.  (Daenerys freeing the slaves for one.)<br /><br />My favorite part of book two in the House of the Undying Ones was painfully inadequate.  What a wonderful opportunity for a terrific artistic expression and HBO blew it.<br /><br />Season One was fun.  Season Two wasn't.<br /><br />Lastly,  HBO promised to \\"do it right\\" with its onscreen depiction of the Fire and Ice series.  With Series two, they forgot their promise.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Me and my sister love this game but it can some times take a while to get get some things but when you come back from doing all that hard work you get a reward it makes you feel proud of yourself and the dragon's are so cool to watch grow up that's why me and my sister love this game so if we like it I think you will like it to its a good family game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is a great program, completely worth the money. helps me sleep even on the roughest nights. works great for babies when. your out or home. I highly recommend this app.

1439170916|5.0|There are so many insightful and wonderful reviews that I feel writing another one would simply be redundant.  However, let me say the following:  I am a fourth year medical student who entered medical school with the idea of becoming and oncologist, in fact I did a joint research degree while in medical school studying osteosarcoma.  At the end of my third year I was inspired by a retinal surgeon and entered ophthalmology with the aim of becoming a retinal surgeon.  However, had I read this book earlier, I would have continued with my quest to pursue hematology/oncology.  This should hopefully sum it up and be testimony to the caliber and greatness of this book.  I can't put this book down since I opened it today, and in fact while on page 115, I was so intrigued that I felt compelled to write this review.  OK, back to reading!
0679746048|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, especially teenage girls. Susanna Kaysen is so funny and relatable. She has interesting points of view on people and events that happen to her, as well as a sense of humor. I couldn't stop reading the book as soon as I purchased it!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|If I was this guy I wouldent waste my time looking for notes while this guy hunted me down I would run like hell. Anyway this game was beyond scary given the fact I played this before bed and never wanted to play it again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I highly recommend this app. It's very useful and I use it often. Not to mention its very easy to use.
B009O2XY12|1.0|it wont even work. I have tried and tried but it wont work. don't waste your time. it is not worth it and it worked on my sisters samsung so don't download it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very simple game that keeps you entertained for hours-now I understand why they have so many of these in truck stops across the country :)

B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I have four versions of this classic album on disc, including a Japanese SACD. I think this one sounds the best. The bonus material is pretty great, too, especially the studio outtakes, which give a fascinating glimpse at how this album came together. If you love this album, I think you'll really enjoy this edition.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Dad's and Mom's, this film is for YOU!  It reminds us all of what we have lost in this day and age: Honor, Respect, and Love of God with our whole hearts, mind, body, and soul.  A MUST OWN for any family working diligently to hold on to these things.  Dad's, it's got a lot of adventure in the mix as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so cool it rocks the whole world with its cool people and hover boards and coins and trains
B0036BK6MW|4.0|I really enjoy this film!  The story line has many elements that encourage when times are rough, and the film itself contains no unnecessary vulgar language or gratuitous sex that distract from the story.  I highly recommend this film.

0962477060|5.0|My guitar instructor strongly recommended this book. It has already made a difference for me. I am beginning to understand how the guitar fretboard is laid out better.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Kind of a dry pilot, but I'm definitely hooked. Can't wait to see how it goes. Even though the accents aren't the best, at least everyone is not talking in English accents like most historical dramas.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is stupendous.  I love the graphics and the music is sootheing.its a great way to pass the time
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all Tom Clancy novels and liked this one a lot.  I particularly like all of the Jack Ryan novels.
B009M7G1PU|2.0|I was inspired to buy this book while reading of its legal woes in Gay Talese's &#34;Thy Neighbor's Wife.&#34;  That reading provided me with a clear illustration of how far the sexual revolution has actually come.  To wit:  If one expected to be titillated by &#34;Lady Chatterly's&#34; Lover,&#34; he would be disappointed in the context of today's provocative fare.<br /><br />Apart from the above, this book is simply boring for the most part.  There is little in the way of action of any kind - sexual or otherwise.  The vast bulk of the text is split between rambling thoughts in the characters' heads and equally rambling, archaic dialogue.  Reading this reminded me of when I was in high school and why I found the required-reading classics so tasteless.<br /><br />One small area of redemption comes from the author's attempt to educate the reader of the age-old struggle between the ownership and working classes.  He would have done better to present it as such, and made that the main focus of the story.
B007REV4T8|4.0|The DVD arrived in a timely fashion. I had heard this movie was very good and I enjoyed it very much.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I was a little skeptical when hubby picked this out to watch but it turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. I highly recommend watching this. It was just as entertaining as slum dog millionaire. Great watch!

0062200909|5.0|My Wife and I have long been fans of the Lord of the Rings, and when the new Hobbit movie came out, we raced to see it and we are waiting with much anticipation for the continuing story. This book just helps add to the tale with its rich and detailed drawings of the current movie. We enjoyed it so much that we have preordered the followup book which is due to come out in April. If you are a Hobbit fan as we are, I strongly recommend this book.<br />RICHARD BURK USAF, USN, USMC RETIRED
B00BESLT6G|4.0|decent movie. just like the third silent hill game. gave me nightmares. I still love the pyramid head and his big knife.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It took me awhile to get all of the characters figured out. I started taking notes to keep them all straight and how they were related. I didn't care about the characters or the story until I was 2/3 of the way done with the book.

B008JFUNAU|1.0|It was a LONG journey down the yellow brick road. In fact I nearly fell asleep while on it. Sam Raimi did to this remake what Rob Zombie did to Halloween...RUINED IT COMPLETELY. I know i'm pretty harsh on reviews so before I start getting all the hate mail... I 'GET' that this was a disney picture. I get that it was not going to be an 'EXACT' remake and I know it's a prequel to the original OZ but if someone is going to 'ATTEMPT' to redo it then i'm going to let them have it if they fail. I don't know how great director's let this happen. Sometimes they should screen this to people who have an opinion before releasing something as it is.<br /><br />First of all, Sam Raimi wants to be Tim Burton so bad it's obvious. The only thing is.. I wished it HAD been Tim Burton who directed this. That being said, The Wizard of Oz was a phenomenon this movie is merely a movie. It will fade with time. I certainly won't be buying it.<br /><br />Lets start with what WAS good. The movie does have a \\"old time\\" feel to it, but it starts to dawn on you that theres really not much going on.. you keep waiting for something to happen and nothing really does. It had the typical plot boy meets girls and of course they all are vying for his love and like scorn women they retaliate when they don't get what they want. Um, how is this different from most movies out there?? The best part of the movie was the last ten minutes when Oz uses his trickery to fool and conquer the witches. This was the only element that really tied into the original oz where you get to know why the man was behind the curtain and that he was not a real wizard and why. The score towards the end did actually sound like the OZ classic. Too bad they didn't follow through throughout the entire movie, as it should have. It did have some cool effects but typical now in most CGI films.<br /><br />The Actors. I don't know about you but i'm getting pretty sick of seeing the same \\"model\\" type actors playing leads. Why don't director's try using no-name actors when directing pictures that everyone will see anyway. This is usually not the case but in movies as big as the WIZARD is, people would see it regardless. Mila Kunis was HORRIBLE as the wicked witch and should have never played it. But it is not her fault. The director along with the wardrobe and the make-up effects personnel did a horrible job with this character and should all be ashamed of themselves. Lets start with the cleavage....YES the wicked witch of the west apparently had cleavage. REALLY?? UM, WHY WAS THAT NECESSARY?? It's just another example of how and why classics get ruined. The wicked witch's outfit was horrible as was the makeup not something the classic would ever let happen. I expected greatness but all I got was a witch that seemed like Raimi copied exactly from the witches in Shrek the final chapter. EXACTLY. Go take a peek, then come back and tell me i'm wrong. I'm getting a little bit tired of Mila Kunis in a lead anyway she needs to take a break she's overkill already. James Franco did a good job, not great, just ok. I'm glad we only had to tolerate Zach Braff for the first ten minutes and Michelle Williams did exactly what I thought she would in her role. I don't remember who the other witch was so that says something. None of them looked like witches in the true sense of the original. The trailer when you see the witch first approaching looks really cool but it's not even in the movie. For some reason they took that out.<br /><br />To me it seemed that Sam Raimi's, OZ the great and powerful, pulled different elements from different films and copied them. I felt Johnny Depp was missing. It had elements from Alice in Wonderland, Shrek the final, and Snow White and the Huntsman all rolled into one. The only difference was the latter films were actually good. It also seems it was geared at children, hence the need for a talking monkey and a china doll. Kids will love them and I know it is a disney...BUT the Wizardof Oz appealed to the young and old alike that is what set it apart from other films, it is timeless and classic. It's sad that Sam Raimi couldn't and didn't achieve this. He should stick to horror movies and keep away from classics that are clearly too big for him.
B008S6B41C|5.0|great  but  there  is  no  point  in revewing  this  i  see  reviews  for  all  different  versions  of  machine  head  here,  it  would  not  amount  to  anything  if  i  review  this,  the  edition  i  bought  was  the  40th  ann  6  cd  edition  wich  is  great  if  you  are  a  major  DP  FAN...
B0007TKNII|5.0|My daughter loves this Movie she got for her birthday, it was everything that was described and the seller shipped it quickly and we are very happy :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I would recommend this series to the ones who read 50 Shades of Gray.. I love how they have nasty pasts that they are working threw. Great story line..
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|The Call of The Wild is a very good book if you have the patience to read it. You also must have an open mind for the struggles of a dog, especially a sled dog
B007TNS6JI|3.0|The game has good graphics and is a lot of fun to play.  However, after several weeks the game hit some kind of error and I lost out.  I had a level 30 trickster with about 10k gold, 96 jewels, upgraded equipment  and all world open with one world almost finished.  After the error the game made me create a new character and when I did, all that stuff was gone.  I was 4 gems away from a new character slot and now it's all gone.  That aside, aside was never able to get the online multi-player to work.  Not even one time.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|She HAD to see it so we spent an afternoon with Anna.<br />It was better than I expected and she was surprised when she saw which character Jude Lay played.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really good graphics easy to understand and a fun experience good for ages 8and up graphics are really good for a free app also there are not that many adds that pop up during the game
1781163243|5.0|Let me start out by saying that Halo 4 was my first real Halo game. I had tried a few other previous Halo games but nothing compares to 4. Now, this book of art from the people who designed Halo 4 is simply amazing! To see how the scenes, warriors, weaponry and vehicles went from idea to fruition is breathtaking. As an artist myself, I can honestly say that this book represents this generation's greats in the world of art. These people will be heralded as the da Vinci or Michaelangelo of our time. This book is well worth more than the price tag attached to it. If you love Halo, or just love art in general, buy this book, you won't regret it!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Loved the quote, &#34;If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room.&#34; Surround yourself with people who will make you better. Great book that will always be on my go to list.
B008220DGE|2.0|&#34;Ths Master&#34; is a movie with 3 Oscar nominations for tha actors (Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams) but no nominations for the writing, direction, or the movie itself. So you have good acting in service of a not so good story here.<br />WW2 vet and drifter Phoenix joins up with a cult headed up by Hoffman and his wife Adams, That's basically the plot but what the point of the story is not easy to determine. Maybe it's to critique cults and their leaders or maybe it's to show that it's not very smart to mix paint thinnner with moonshine. None of the characters are likeable and the audience is not going to care what happens to them.<br />Some may think there's something deep and profound going on here but the only thing of any depth I saw here was the ocean. The good performances take this up to 2 stars but without those, it is a one star movie.
B00881VLCE|3.0|this game is fun but when I turn it off all I get is  a black screen when I try to turn it back on. I removed it and loaded it again and it did the same thing, worked until I turned it off. kinds sad when it worked I really did have fun with it, I would have used it a lot.
B00942X8PY|4.0|I don't see myself playing this for hours at a time, it's just too tedious. It's a great program, stable and puzzle game of games, really makes you think hard- brain exercises
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun game, good graphics. Compared to other similar shark games, this 1 wins hands down. Get it, it's free! Boom!
B002MCJZHS|3.0|Some good chords and melodies, a little too beat-y at times.A few songs go well with a Mazzy Sar playlist.
B008CJ0KI8|3.0|I don't really listen to a lot of mainstream &#34;rap/hip-hop/r&b&#34; and I didn't really know anything about Frank Ocean, but after he won big at the Grammys I decided to get the album. Half the songs are fun and catchy, while the other half I skip from lack of interest. Also, some of the obscene references to the female form get repetitive after a few songs.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!  One of the better movies I have seen in a long time.  Yes, you have to read subtitles (unless you speak French) but after 5 minutes, you forget you are doing it.  Tremendous characters in a simple but moving story.  There are some really funny parts of this movie as well as dramatic.  Both of the main characters sell this story.  It is well worth the time.
B005OUDDK0|5.0|Something about James Blake's voice drives me crazy. I love it. I probably listened to this album 20 times back-to-back after I purchased it. I &#34;A Case of You&#34; cover is great. It would make Joni Mitchell jealous. Download it for yourself and see.

B007REV4YI|5.0|This is one of the best movies in the continuing saga of James Bond. Daniel Craig's protrayal of James Bond is fantastic. The ending in this movie is a mind blower.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|Fell in love with the people of Larkrise and Candleford from the very first episode!  Flawed but loveable. characters bring the rich story lines to life amid  the backdrop of a charming town, quaint village and beautiful music. You'll laugh, cry and be touched by each episode, unable to stay away too long.
0385535147|3.0|Doing what he does best, Grisham immediately gained my interest in his main character. I loved the first half of this book. It is a tribute to the author's writing style that I followed it to the end. I expected a courtroom scene but was disappointed when the story continued in a a direction that completely baffled me as the reader.<br />Worth a read, but not my favorite Grisham tale by far.
0452273331|5.0|I had never read Ayn Rand before this book, but it was recommended to me by a friend. Although I don't necessarily agree with her philosophy, I thought it was a good story and she makes some interesting points.<br />The story centers around Howard Roark as he is expelled from architecture school and his subsequent ventures. Roark is an almost Christ-like figure and gathers a small band of followers as the story progresses. He stands for all things logical and rational and never surrenders his principles or compromises for what he wants. Roark is one of the best characters I have ever read about in literature.<br />Parts of the dialogue are wooden, but this is to be expected, as it is 1. written in the 1940's and 2. a vehicle for Rand's beliefs. Many of the main characters go off on long speeches about collectivism, etc. The philosophy in this book is very heavy handed, but fits into the plot. If you go in with bias about Rand and objectivism, you will not like the story. A lot of the characters are also very simplistic, as is the language. I would not call this book satirical, but some of the elements of the story border on hyperbolic.<br />This book is definitely dated. There is only one main female character, and she acts much more demurely than many of the men. Dominique never (at least not that I can recall) argues with any of her 3 husbands, although she despised 2 of them. When she first meets Roark, he rapes her and it isn't a big deal and she even ends up tell her father at the end of the book. It is also interesting to note that Roark, Rand's ideal man, is a rapist.<br />Although I don't agree with some of reviewers on here that say Rand has changed their lives, I definitely thought it was an eye-opening read.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Actually I think I was much more enthralled with this suspense story that the famed Gone Girl. I held me captivated until I finished it two days after I began reading.<br />The story line was believable and terrifying. I couldn't wait to see how it ended and feared it would end predictably. Loved the ending. The author pulled it off in a way that was very satisfying. Can't wait to read more by this author.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Even on a cell phone screen, I had a viceral response to playing this game I could only describe as scared!<br /><br />This is a keeper!

B001P9EQH8|1.0|It's a nice idea to have a portable amplifier without batteries, but it doesn't work well in this case. This item has to be constantly recharged. At some point it gets annoying: this amplifier doesn't give a warning about weak charge, it just not turning on.
B007WULJ5G|3.0|Absolutely the most disturbing piece of film I have ever seen in my life! I do like to watch films that push the limit BUT this film went WAY over the limit! I am still very shook up hours after viewing it!!!. This film Is definately NOT for the weak at heart.  If you watch it...Be VERY prepared for what you are about to experience! In my opinion , it made &#34;Salo&#34; seem like a Disney film!! Go ahead if you dare-!!!
B0013FBS20|4.0|I Am Legend is a movie based on a 1954 novel by Richard Mathewson. It is the 3rd movie adaption of the novel.<br /><br />The CGI is decent -- we see a decaying NYC with weeds growing through the streets and a completely empty Times Square and Grand Central Station. Some people have complained about the rate of decay, but that is a bit trifling.<br /><br />It's a difficult acting task -- Will Smith is only accompanied by a dog for the first half of the movie. The viewer gets a glimpse of what it would be like both intellectually and emotionally if one were the last human on Earth.<br /><br />The movie was made in 2007. The background is that cancer is cured in 2009, but the side effects of the cure causes a horrific new virus that wipes out 99% of the world population. Equally awful, 99% of the 1% that survives is infected and they attack the remaining survivors. It is now 2012 and Richard Neville has been working for the past 3 years to find a cure. And he is the last man on Earth.<br /><br />The first 2 acts of this movie are brilliant. The final third is a little rushed and overwrought, but it's still an excellent film.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Enjoyed the the series.  At times the accents inhibited my understanding of the story.  I enjoyed solving the case with the characters.  I recommend the first season.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have read this whole series so far. I can't wait til the next one comes out. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good adventure/fantasy.

B009B8YZKS|3.0|This is the first Microsoft product in 20 years that I did not have to reboot, worry about crashing or want to beat to death out of frustration.<br /> It is the best of the various movies so far. Even if you are not a Halo fan you can get into the movie.<br /> My only real problem is that it does seem to take too long to get up to speed.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I have been an aviation enthusiast since childhood.<br />\\"Flight\\" was well written, and the performance of the entire cast was exceptional.<br />In particular, I enjoyed John Goodman; additionally, Denzel Washington performed from the heart.<br /><br />The story was void of the traditional, \\"happy ending\\"; yet, the ending was fitting, given the way that events unfolded.<br /><br />I honestly enjoyed this film, but I would not watch it, again, because it was somewhat depressing.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It was just what I needed to get my Kindle up and running again!  I was lost without it!!! LOL

B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is good but slows down my kindle...but it still is very good and entertaining. I really enjoy it and another reason I give it four stars is that it has a lot of good things and some bad things.
0060324600|5.0|Not quite as good as the 4th edition overall, but it has certain points to it that are superior to any other edition.  For instance the chapter concerning stock selection for the enterprising investor is better in this edition that any other one.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|My daughter loves this series and watches it over and over again, says it is amazing. Thanks so much. DVD was is amazing conditition
B0090EHVMC|3.0|I didn't love this movie, and my 3-year old daughter didn't seem super into either. It had most of the elements of a successful Seuss movie, but just didn't seem to work for us. Nice visuals, but the way they adapted the story wasn't really ideal for cinema, i thought. Also, the songs weren't great, catchy, or well-placed. It wasn't terrible, just...okay.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie had an outstanding plot. Bruce Willis is always a plus. I watched the trailor and expected it to be much better, but a good movie to watch for sure.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My husband and I both loved this movie. It had some great comic moments, good characters, great superhero action. You should watch it!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset is for any intense gamer such as myself. I was very pleased at the sound quality. I also like the fact that you can change the chat and game sounds to different levels. Very pleased with this purchase. Improved my gameplay for sure.
B000LX00RY|5.0|The September Issue and Devil Wears Prada are must-owns for any fashionista. Meryl Streep is absolutely great as you-know-who, the fashion magazine goddess. Anne Hathaway is always a little irritating to watch but is good and pulls off the fashion ingenue part well. Bought it on Amazon where I watch it every few months.
B0094K1QR8|1.0|Morally corrupt, as one would expect. Dead end story with no plot. Lasting relationships don't start in the bedroom because they are not built on sexual gratification.
B003VMIGM8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. All the principals were great and the story was well told. At the risk of sounding pervi-sh, the sex scene between Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried was way hot! I've seen it twice and definitely recommend it as an excellent thriller.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Ray Lamontagne is so unusual and his music is so unconventional, it's hard to describe.  It's parts rock, soul, country and troubader all of which combine to make an excellent &#34;road trip&#34; album (CD).  Love it, listen to it regularly.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME VERSION OF TEMPLE RUN. The graphics are the best, very colorful and whimsy. The game runs smoothly on the Kindle Fire hd. The power ups are different to use. You collect gems and its along a run. The keys are used for bonus at the end of a run. The gems can be used for both resurrecting after you die or power-ups during a run. Thanks for bringing another great game out. Well worth the .99.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|could have been a little more depth, but I like the modern edge to it.  The bad guys are not as diabolical as I would have liked and the contract hire judge twist kinda sucked.  Overall, good movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The entire book was good but I couldn't fight the feeling that I was reading a rerun (Sleeping With the Enemy). That was until the end. The ending made the book for me. I also liked the narration from different view points.
B005H9B44A|5.0|A fun movie packed with action and amazing visual effects. Very creative and original sets and fantastic costumes. Loved it all!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Ok but a rip off of temple run on the game and Florida Marlins to come to hit the best in the world
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|First we had the HBO version, The Girl, about Tippi Hedren's romance with Hitchcock and because the director did not get what he wanted he destroyed her career. In the HBO version, Mrs. Hitchcock was portrayed as weak. What i liked about this version is that the Hitchcocks were equally matched. As portrayed by Helen Mirren, the wife was portrayed as someone who responed to what her husband did by cheating on her, she found someone to keep her company and her mind mentally active. He was jealous, but they stayed together for convience sake.<br />Janet Leigh was portrayed with someone who had more scruples than Ms.Hedren and her career survived as did Vera Miles, who had a brief dailliance with Mr.Hitchcock. As portrayed by Mr.Hopkins, Alfred Hitchcock, he found something missing in his martial relationship that caused him to look for something from Ms.Hedren, Ms.Leigh, Ms.Miles and the late Suzanne Pleshette. But the one thing you can't take away from Alfred Hitchcock is that he made good movies and his television shows, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Me and my friend are at a sleepover and we got this game.  And when we saw him we screamed!!
B006TTC54A|5.0|The Blu-Ray version of this film is a big upgrade from even the DVD. And, I'm happy to report that Universal even spent some time and money cleaning up the soundtrack.<br /><br />There are some neat bonuses on this BD as well.<br /><br />One of my all-time favorite movies - funny and loaded with musical talent.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0094AH3MU|4.0|This year of the Verdi Bi-Centennial has produced dvd's of many really obscure operas. (The Tutti Verdi will include ALL his operas!)  This is certainly one as it has almost never been performed after its initial London run in 1847.  And why is that?<br /><br />Well, the book is certainly the key problem.  Brothers feuding (and over a girl) is nothing new, and Carlo taking up with the bandits makes for some exciting men's chorus opportunities that Verdi carries out very well.  The ending (with Francesco a suicide though NOT according to Julian Budden [[ASIN:0198162618 The Operas of Verdi: Volume 1: From Oberto to Rigoletto]], and Carlo killing Amalia (I still don't get the reason) are problems as well.  Also, since the first performances were considered a failure, it has been tainted and no one has bothered to pick it up.  Frankly, it is just one that has slipped through the cracks.<br /><br />I think it has good music, though it would fall into just middling Verdi- but that is still very good indeed.  The Third Act duet between Carlo and Amalia was beautiful, and I loved the chorus numbers too.  There are quite a few others.  NOTE that the forms (double arias, grand duets, etc) are very traditional- but who did them  better than Verdi?)<br /><br />As for the staging, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  i would call the set deconstructionist Post-modern with debris everywhere, grafitti on the movable walls (\\"liberta o morte\\"), and, oddly, a big leather chair to act around.  But with Carlo's world collapsing, including his own morals by leading a band of bandits, it is not so inappropriate.  And the lighting (yes, klieg lights on the stage) works effectively.  No problems for me. Let me also add that the costumes worked for me- especially the banditos in their leather coats and fedoras.<br /><br />I happen to really like Aquiles Machado, especially his Nemorino ([[ASIN:B0000C7PRD Donizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Esposito, Machado, Marrucci, Canzian, Schrott, Muus, Macerata Opera]], and he was terrific here.  Also, Artur Rucinski as the evil Francesco (played like Richard II with a limp and hunchback) was also terrific.<br /><br />All in all, a very satisfying video release, and, finally we have one of this opera.  Tutti Verdi, indeed!
B000Y5JFN4|5.0|There are so many inside jokes in this movie (many of them visual) that can only be fully appreciated by musicians that I almost hesitate to give it a great overall recommendation. I say that because many non-musician friends of mine didn't realize this movie was a parody until I told them! Hard to figure how one can miss the obvious, but there it is. They thought the band was \\"a bunch of idiots.\\" Well, yeah, but very human as well.<br /><br />When all is said and done, this movie is just flat out funny, so don't hesitate.<br /><br />BTW - there's some great extra material on this BD, including clips from the old \\"Joe Franklin Show\\" that ran for decades on NYC TV. Blast from the past!<br /><br />This film comes up great on BD, including the soundtrack.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game is so lame all you do is get food and money I would barf on this game it is so lame plus you have to pay money to get a lot of the stuff you need I played500$ bucks just to get to level 50 I AM so glad it is free trust me or else.
B005LAII1C|4.0|This was an enjoyable diversion of a movie, though I felt it lost a bit of steam by the end.<br /><br />I'd rate it as rental fodder, rather than spending on purchasing the BD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well ended saga.<br />It wasn't overly predictable, and that was refreshing.  A smart read for lovers of young adult fiction.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Love the entire avenger series and I like this the best. Really like the Hulk. Hate to say it but Loki is right.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|They did a very nice job with it.  You get several paper shapes design with the initial purchase, but can also buy other sets of shapes for 0.99.  Not bad.  The kids (9 & 5) both enjoy it and love that they continually come up with new designs.  Its worth it if you're into spin art without, you know, the serious mess of actual spin art.
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|We're a military family hoping to integrate as much as possible while we are stationed overseas, I have been wondering how best to take advantage of our situation and transition our children smoothly.  This book addressed our circumstances, and is helping me to prepare for our move!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It wasn't a book &#34;I just couldn't put down &#34; but it was a good read and I really enjoyed it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story unfolded expertly in Ms Flynn's more-than-capable hands.  You vacillate from love to hate and back to love with these unique fully realized characters and the very intricate situation the author has created and so deftly plays out.  Guaranteed to hook you... I honestly can't remember the last time I was glued to a chair and didn't move til I turned the final page.  Well done!
B005H9B44A|3.0|watched to the end out of curiosity, not because I was enthralled. If you're up for something mindless, this would be it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I loved this version of Emma.  It lifted the heart. Romola does a great job of portraying Emma. She is fun-spirited, charming and gives the character great personality. I disagree with another review that says she does not exhibit the manners of her time and society. She was well-mannered with a jovial spunk. It shows that even though her status required decorum, there was room for individual personality. And the character was not meant to be perfect, along with the society she represents with its presumed superiority (not always superior but arrogant in thinking so).  It was beautifully done.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I cannot believe I just learned about this true story a month or so ago.  It is about chivalry, honor and bravery.  This story definitely breaks the notion that all Germans in WWII were NAZI's.  When Franz stigler (German air ace) saw the wounded B-17 (Dec 20,1943).  He considered it to be a parachute for wounded men, and could not make himself shoot it down. . .even though it would gain him the &#34;Knight's Cross&#34; from Germany.  Instead, he escorted the wounded plane past the Atlantic wall to safety before saluting and turning for home.  He later said that if he did not escort the plane it would be as if he shot it down himself. . . the BEST German FLAK gunners were on the Atlantic Wall ready to shoot down Allied bombers.  Had one of the bomber gunners shot at Franz he would have gone down.  Had his government learned he helped and American bomber. . .he could have been executed as a traitor. Incredible . . . rare . . . .story.  Puts me in mind of &#34;Silent Night&#34;  a movie based on a true story about WWII. .. Christmas '44.
B00ATCIPQA|5.0|Read the book first but found listening to Dr. Alexander himself very impressive. Since I deal with end-of-life individuals on a regular basis as a volunteer RN, I find the audio helpful for someone to listen to when they have limited energy or a limitation to read the book. For some individuals I have only spoken about Dr. Alexander's experience to provide reassurance about their own personal spriituality and what follows physical death. It is an easy read. The author explained the \\"science\\" well in terms most people can understand.
B004I744AS|5.0|Much better than the Webster app that came on my kindle. The Webster app is a waste of space but it won't. let me delete it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy playing this Mahjong. The downside is that it keeps popping up for me to buy Mahjong2. It is disconcerting to pay for an app and still have to deal with ads. I would suggest changing this as I'm sure I'm not the only one who dislikes this annoying feature.
0007447868|5.0|I don't get how anyone could rate this book poorly. People say that it's slow and nothing happens? I think this is one of my favorite in the series (Arya's plot is my favorite in the cannon). There's a note from the author at the end of the book that I recommend reading if you're unsure about this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple and easy to play on a Kindle Fire.  Like the auto complete. feature so I can get in more games...<br />2 thumds up

B008RA3X5E|4.0|This App was easy to set up and works well.  I have a 1st gen Kindle Fire and was impressed by the functionality.  I would recommend this App to all Fire users.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a good game but there is 1 thing that bothers me they barley want to play, which means<br />1 you can not get alot of money<br />2.you can't change your pet to a different and rarer one<br />3.sometimes without the minigames the game gets Boring<br /><br />So if the pets would like to play more I would defiantly give this app a 5 star rating.<br />Sometimes I have to wait until the next day to play with my pets. But until they change that it's a 4 in my book

B000FC1PNE|5.0|Very enjoyable series.  Books well written and hard to put down. Could be read by itself, but the series you will read because the characters hook you in.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love Bruno Mars and this CD has such great songs.  Worth purchasing the entire CD for sure -- you won't regret it!
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Steven Wilson is a prolific and talented man, that's for sure..To me Grace for Drowning was very good but didn't quite live up to Insurgentes even after many listens...<br /><br />This one is right up there with Insurgentes for me...A little short but so much depth and so many surprises. I think it has more that keeps me coming back than Grace for Drowning did...Something I can't quite put my finger on. Anyway I'm dying to see this in concert now.<br /><br />Luminol is a great overall piece, Drive Home is touching, Holy drinker has incredible instrumentation and the rest is gold too....pick it up if you can!
B000F1IQN2|5.0|This movie is phenomenal.  It really raises questions about how to best fight terrorism.  Revenge and fighting terrorism with terrorism is not the way to go.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Brilliant insight on nearly every page!  Read it for fun, read for application to whatever kind of work you do.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The first book was phenomenal!  I couldn't put these books down, I have to give Suzanne Collins credit for that.  The first book had me hooked for the last two.  However, the last two books were a huge letdown.  The second and third books slowly lose excitement, passion, and chemistry as they dwindle down into a lackluster ending that doesn't make any sense.  I was severely disappointed when I put down Mockingjay...
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love the kindle fire and minecraft!!!<br />how can i possibly be happier than this?<br />everyone should at least give it a try.
B000AP04MO|5.0|If you love a really good love story, the kind that draws you in and makes you 'feel', then you'll love this movie.  Joanna and Mark are beautiful to look at, and the moodiness of the film, and their deep feelings for each other are messy and honest and they just pull you in.  I watch this movie every couple of years, and I never tire of this couple.  I did a quick search to see if there was any information about their relationship, and found an article by Hepburn's sons and long time partner before her death, who said she and Finney were romantically involved while filming this picture.  All I can say is, it shows.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|the music really adds to it. and this is SOOOOO much better than any slender man game ive played. k screamed when I died. :p
B00122TDAS|5.0|This is Genesis at the top of their game. Everything about this album is superb. The mood, the music, lyrics, it just all works so well. Too bad they lost Steve Hackett after this. While their later albums, especially Then there were Three and A Trick of the Tail,  we very good,  they just never reached the level they achieved here.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Definitely enjoyed this album.  I did like their previous effort a little bit more though.  Babel and Reminder are standout tracks for me.  This album lacked some of the power and crescendo's that I had really enjoyed on their previous album.  In addition, I personally found the lyrics on a few to be very sad.  However, if you are going through a personal struggle of some sort, that is not necessarily a bad thing.  In that case, these songs may be of great comfort.  In spite of the criticism previously stated, I like this album very much and listen to it often when I'm in the mood for mellow background music while working or doing something creative like editing photos.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story was emotional, captivating, and held me up until the very last page. Whenever I set the book down I wanted to pick it up and keep reading it. Definitely a page turner, and worth the read.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I rented the ebook from my library and my subscription ran out before I could finish the whole book.  I was so involved in the story that I immediately purchased the kindle version from Amazon.  I was concerned going in that the story may lose some momentum now that I'd hit the third installment.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  I felt this story was a little bit more of a page turner than the previous two in the series.  While I loved those books, I felt they had the occasional slow moments that dragged on here and there.  I did not experience that at all with Voyager.  You can tell that Diana has done her research.  I was fascinated by the details given about life at sea during this time period.  I felt like I was getting a real glimpse of the time.  I think that's why I've enjoyed this series so much.  The auther does such an amazing job of describing what it must have been like for Claire (and the reader) to be thrust into this past era.  Really enjoyed it.  A real page turner, or in my case, screen swiper.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Move over Luke skywalker because the force is strong with this one. If you haven't played this game then you have not lived. This action packed game has all your favoret star wars charitors in the forms of your favorit birds. So may the force be with you.

B0076DELIG|5.0|The latest Harry Bosch novel finds Harry trying to solve the murder of a Danish newspaper woman killed during the L.A. riots twenty years before.  Harry was the officer who responded to this murder scene during the riots and was unable at that time to pursue.  Twenty years later and now working cold cases Harry is determined to find out who killed her and why.  This takes Harry to central California to investigate bis \\"hunch\\", while also under investigation by internal affairs for what he feels is a trumped up charge.  There are many twists in this story to keep the reader wondering about what will happen next.  A definite must read for every Harry Bosch fan.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I bought this Item because I'm a big BVB fan and I must say that it tops what they have done so far. Jinx's violin is something simply gorgeous. I suggest this record obviously to all BVB fans,but also tho those who love classic rock with a touch of modernity
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this app is amazing! I made mount Olmpus with quartz. I like to take wooden planks and make sail boats with. I made hogwarts! on survival I made a giant mine shaft

B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I think that this book is great because it shows both sides of the demigod camp working together and it also shows amazing friendship even after all they went through together as a team
B004LZFWJO|5.0|LOVE this game.  Addictive and great for hand/eye coordination deficits, Improves focus, Leaderboards allow you to see your progress and improvement. Thumbs up for a game that is actually constructive.

B00AN0KBJC|2.0|I was so looking forward to Season 2 but am deeply disappointed in the quality of delivery. There must have been 15 reloads during the 54 minute program. I am asking for a refund on the unwatched episodes....

B006MW3UZW|5.0|The costuming, the intricate story plots, the impending demise of a way of life, the fall of the aristocracy along with the heat-up in Ireland. And, oh my gosh, the season finale for season 2. I don't want to spoil it for those who have not yet watched, but OMG!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Interesting and alternative take on familiar ground, though through a lens we don't often see. I'm about halfway through the book and enjoy it, though I don't always agree.<br /><br />I was unaware that Henry Wallace played more of a role than I knew. Sometime I'll have to read a bio of a fellow Hawkeye.
0060723513|5.0|Then this is for you. Whether you believe this story or not, it gives you plenty to think about regarding our world, our purpose, and the way you approach any trial or blessing that comes your way. I purchased this copy for a gift for a cynacal friend hoping it provides another point of view and breaks some of the black and white thinking we sometimes adopt since it is easy. Perhaps a few people will begin to notice nuance that makes each situation not so obvious after all.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very pleased with this case.  Have used it for three months now.  It provides more than adequate protection with a lightweight unobtrusive design.  Material has a rubberized coating and felt protection for the screen on the inside.  Doesn't add bulk to the kindle fire and fits perfectly.  Highly recommend, good value.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Once I saw the show I had to have it and it contains all the song transitions that kept the show moving seamlessly. Reminded me of why these particular songs are great, and many of these are at least every so slightly off the beaten path of their many hits. And although I know every single one by heart, I hear details of these songs in this recording that I have never heard before. I dig it.
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit is an easy and enlightening read. It has an interesting viewpoint on how HABITS influence every entity in this world; be it individuals, organizations or societies in general. I was very much impressed by the author's style of writing anecdotes to explain all the intriguing ideas in this book. He often narrates more than two interesting stories in parallel - just like a gripping movie with parallel screenplays - to bring out the main concept embedded in each chapter. They are truly inspiring and make you wonder how habits, as trivial as it may seem, can have such a powerful effect in our lives. I personally liked the first two sections of the book more than the last section on how habits influence societies.  The earlier sections - which focused on individual and organizational habits - were far more convincing and helped me think about my \\"Keystone Habits.\\"  These are important or pivotal habits that induce other good routines in our system, thereby, helping us achieve our final goal. This was explained quite brilliantly by the author when he talked about successful companies such as Alcoa and Starbucks.<br /><br />However, if there were one criticism, I would say that this book fails to explain how you can use the concepts to change your old and defective habits. Towards the end, the author gives a general framework that one can apply, and does not get into the details of breaking specific bad habits. But I would still highly recommend this book, since it does offer a different and powerful perspective about our human mind. One can use this awareness to his or her advantage and make a conscious effort to lead a better life!
B005E35JCM|5.0|I bought it for the interview on the DVD, since I already had the music. I particularly like the kid pictures of the two of them. The CD is great but available for less if you're not interested in the interview. The 2 music videos are ok as well, but they're things you can see on youtube for free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazing! It never froze or crash! I love it and glad a downloaded it! You wont regret it!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I won't distract you with my petty review.  Simply know if you love fantasy this is one of the finest ever books ever written.  It won't make much sense unless you have read the previous books in the series though.
B00AW0KGYI|4.0|I already owned Breaking Dawn-Part 1. As a fan of the series, I felt I had to get this &#34;extended&#34; edition. I could pick out a few short scenes that hadn't been in the first edition, but I don't feel any of it added significantly to the film. If you're a big fan of the series, by all means-round out your set. If you don't live and breathe Twilight-you can probably skip it safely without missing out.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great depiction of Abe Lincoln's political savviness in such a grave and important moment for US history. I highly recommend it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Great coming of age movie. I think just about anyone that lived through high school can relate. I would definitely buy again.
B00319KS7C|4.0|\\"Following along a vein of offbeat dark comedies like Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy and Richard Linklater's Bernie, it was no surprise to me that The Informant!, this complex allegory about the dangers of agency and corporate bureaucracy. The film as a whole might seem a bit ordinary at first but it certainly delves into some unique artistic territories and vein with its highly quirky yet cynical use of humour, extraordinarily crafted musical score (that reminds you that this could be from the 1970s film from Robert Altman), and well-crafted, nuanced performances from Damon who plays former whistle-blower/Archer-Daniels-Midland vice-president, Mark Whitacre, and even a commendable one to Joel McHale who plays one of the FBI agents. The thematic treatment of the film is strange at best and does not following much in the way of cliche or come across as being predictable. Every twist and turn is coming through and the audience engages with the passive-aggressive bipolar Whitacre as he tries overcoming his paranoia. If you see on its own for what it is, along with the already complementary deleted scenes on the DVD, it may a very interesting film but a very boring one and unlike Michael Clayton, this one seems to shine a light on something daring, darkly humorous, and unique so at best take times to repeat certain scenes to connect the dots. After that, you'll eventually feel the wrath of Soderbergh communicating to the most perplexed yet most sane audiences.\\"
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I enjoyed reading it.  Was very sadden when I found out that he was killed.  I haddent finish the book when i found out.  A true hero.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|\\"Quintessential Brian Eno at his finest with the album most people associate him as being an electronic musician than also a producer and collaborator of high-level projects like Talking Heads. Eno's fascination with the calming and atmospheric signals this pioneer album with such excellence that, despite its small number of tracks and lack of variety, is acceptable for all listeners and tastes. No composition, which follows in the vein of a classical music's type of length, is better than other but altogether fits one particular mood- ambience through mental mathematical calculation.\\"
0062238868|3.0|After all the news surrounding the death of Chris Kyle I became interested in reading his autobiography. I was really curious about the mindset that it takes to be \\"the most lethal sniper...\\" Reading this book I learned that, and a lot more. I think the book is worth reading and was interesting in the sense that you got a sniper's view of war in Iraq. It was also interesting to learn about the SEAL training that he went through. However, I also learned that I don't think Chris Kyle was so much of a patriot as he was someone that loved to kill people. Reading this book puts into perspective his love for war and killing people (yes, he LOVES it and made that clear). It's almost like he sees war as a video game, where he is competing with other SEALs to see who can get the most kills. He thinks it's funny to blow people's heads off, laughs at their death, and comes across as an amazingly arrogant person. I don't think it was so much his love of country that kept him fighting in the war. I think it was his love of killing people. He thoroughly enjoyed taking human life, which I found odd even for a SEAL. You would think that they do what they have to, because there is a job to be done. But this man took pleasure in killing humans. Taking lives was just a big game to him and he was out to rack up the most points. Killing people was even more important to him than spending time with his own family (wife, kids). He spent very little time with them and when he did it didn't seem like it went well (bar fights, staying out late, contacting the old girlfriend, talking to a two year old like he's a teenager, etc.). I think he could have done his job with a lot more dignity, or at least not bragged so much about taking lives and laughing about it after he did. Finally, after reading this book the one thing I feel about his death is that I am only surprised that he hadn't been killed long before he was. With his arrogant attitude, the way he treated fellow military members, and his love of killing people in general I am not surprised that someone stopped him. I'm just surprised they didn't stop him sooner. I think people should read this book so that they can see the real Chris, the one who boasted about taking human lives and lacked dignity. I can say that I am glad that Chris was on our side and not the enemy's. I still think it's a good book and worth reading. I found it interesting.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|\\"Django Unchained, along with his predecessor Inglourious Basterds, incorporates the ultra-violent, rebellious/anarchic, and \\"hero of our times\\" kind of concept that have been prevalent in Roman and Greek mythology- someone who stood for something. In addition, it pays nods to classic westerns and exploitation cinema of the '60s and '70s from Sergio Leone (as obvious as the Ennio Moricone name in the opening credits), Clint Eastwood (The Outlaw Josey Wales and Dirty Harry come into mind), Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch and Straw Dogs both have a vigilante's drive), and films like Shaft signifying Black struggle. Slavery being the main issue here is treated in a rather uneven way but because this film is fictional by all means and the \\"hero\\" representation that is Django elevates the film into steering unexpected territory. Don't expect coming in seeing Roots or The Help which deal with similar issues but don't contain the graphic idealism that is encrypted in Django. It isn't fair to say about what is good and what's bad compared to his other works but it certainly made me surprised and the dialogue, while tiring to a certain point, maintains its witty banter and the film altogether works like a very dark comedy that is funny yet disturbing at the same time. In terms of violence, this isn't as worse or any different from Kick-Ass or Afro Samurai which all lean on exploitation and sensationalism to the highest order- this holds at least some historical context. On other grounds, the performances were stellar especially from Foxx, DiCaprio, and Waltz and the editing, cinematography, and \\"some\\" of the choice of music (aside from the uneven hip-hop) are exceptional to what it is trying to be.\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book so beautiful. Everything in, and about this book gives me hope. The story is is real. The love and passion and trust and lust the two main characters have is absolutely unreal. This book makes me think twice about what I want in life and who I want in my life and what kind of a person they are. If you are ever looking for an amazing book to read, don't you dare pick another book before this one.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|\\"Matilda now was finally revisited after five to six years of not seeing it in its entirety. The film, now seen to this point on, is much more intriguing than I would have thought and imagined mostly in context of the film, and possibly the novel's, criticism toward parenting, negligence, mistreatment, and authoritarian figures. While fantasy does overlay the story's rather believable nature toward the second half, it is nonetheless a rather frightening, violent (let us not forget the chokey), and upsetting indictment of how children become dissatisfied or tormented with what they see and be around. The PG rating is justified but parents are advised of potentially nightmarish material and occasional mixed messages the film conveys. Danny DeVito, the director of Matilda, conveys in a strange way this vision of two opposites, his narrative side focusing on Matilda's strengths and the rude, shady qualities that exist with the rest of the Wormwood family. Much of the characters can be construed as stereotypical but many of them are also believable and reassuring for younger audiences to see into how they are not alone. In many ways, Matilda is a modern and Americanised update of Alice in Wonderland and a sister work to Coraline in which they portray rather daring and independent women amidst chaos, crisis, and family breakdown. As a whole, it is a surprisingly genius film all these years since first seeing it and the positive messages within its female lead make for great mother-daughter discussion.\\"
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Amazing album. One of APC's best. A must for any fan's collection. Maynard's voice is so hauntingly beautiful, at times brutally personal, the melodies caress your soul. The music takes you to such emotion, its therapeutic. I'm a huge fan of Maynard's other side projects as well but this album is definitely a key jewel-piece in his complete life anthology.
B0087IT8FK|4.0|\\"One of the few foreign films I have seen in quite some time (after the Indonesian film, The Raid), Intouchables, one of the highest-grossing French films of all time (at $400+ million worldwide) stands as one of the most significant films recently on my must-see list. After a long wait for the Region 1 DVD, Intouchables is a great, surprisingly hilarious, and rather watchable effort that does not really disappoint. Sy as the ballsy and confident Driss provides a performance that encapsulates a character who is funny, aware, and a realist. Cluzet provides a believable and ironic performance as Philippe showcasing his disability also signals his lack of amusement and sarcastic views about life. Even with positive feedback, the film does notably suffer from a precise narrative that emphasises on how Philippe came to be paraplegic and how he went to the hospital toward the end. The film, while it may deal with the struggles between the high-class and low-class, is not really politically-charged and controversial (as a film like La Haine would) more than it is an Oscar-like comedy-drama about human emotions and feelings dealing with disability, economic status, negligence, culture, family, and work ethics. Altogether, considering the fact that it mutes any direct politics, the film is best watched as a guilty pleasure given its positive, sometimes carefree perspective about life. Given this reason, it is no wonder why the film performed so well in Europe and even Australia and South Korea. Even if you are afraid of subtitles, the film will not make you look away or feel bored one bit when you see Driss make daily ends meet through following experimental methods of caring for Philippe and enhances his pretentious lifestyle.\\"

B007HC3LHS|5.0|What a fantastic novel.  I have to say that I normally don't even read any story written in the first person, even by my favorite authors, but I made an exception for this novel and how glad I am that I did so.  This story is so incredibly written that I stayed up until 7am to finish reading it as I could not sleep until I did so.<br /><br />Read this book!  Seriously!!

B00942X8PY|3.0|HUEBRIX was installed on the original Kindle fire and played it for few hours. The puzzle game is nice but certain aspects are unfair in my opinion.<br /><br />1. If you decide to pause the game or reset a level the timer keeping going on & on and you never get awarded properly.<br />2. Zero instructions, You have figure things out by trial and error.<br />3. There is possibility of in-app purchases for other games which is not liked by most for a paid app.<br /><br />Update the game and you have an excellent puzzle game deserving attention.
B007IK44CK|5.0|This movie was awesome!  I enjoyed this with my family who also though that it was good, fun, and dangerous . . .Dangerous but fun!  Action packed, something that would have a person on the edge of their seats during the majority of the movie!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This is by far the scariest game that I ever played on Kindle fire. It does bring a chill and every step you take the music and background effects makes this game truly scary!<br /><br />The objective is very simple, All you have to do is collect pages strategically placed somewhere in the game map. The controls works okay. You move with a joystick control using your left thumb and you can also use your right finger to see up or down. This is no fast game which fits the environment perfectly. Even with simple black & white graphics the game is scary because of superb sound effects. This is the creepiest game that I ever played on my kindle fire. After about 1 hour of playing I got scared enough to stop and take my breath it made me remember of playing Silent hill on the original PlayStation.<br /><br />As most reviewers has already pointed out if you want to believe it play it and see it yourself it is indeed scary! - I still feel someone is watching me while writing this review! -- eeeek!<br /><br />Have fun!
B001GCUNYO|1.0|As quite a few other have stated, this Blu-ray disc did not function in my player either.

B003Y5D776|5.0|I had purchased a couple cheap USB audio interfaces off eBay - they have LEDs that light up/flash when on or muted.  Well, every flash introduced noise into the line.  Since I needed them for my podcast setup, the cheap ones weren't going to work.  I decided to try these to avoid the noise and they work GREAT!  Highly recommend these

B00C5W3SBE|3.0|\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is a charming prequel to the 1939 classic \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  It shares a number of themes and visuals with the older movie, including the nicely done black and white introduction that transitions into the stunningly colorful Land of Oz.<br /><br />The story beings in 1905 Kansas with a small-time circus magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco), Oz for short.  Oz is a con man, a charlatan, and a cad, but he might also be a man who wants to be better.  A balloon ride into a tornado dumps Oz in the Land of Oz.  There, he meets the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis), and learns that he is the fulfillment of a prophesy that a wizard would come from the skies to save the Land of Oz from an evil witch.<br /><br />Oz travels to the Emerald City, where he meets Theodora's sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and is bribed into going after a third witch, the allegedly evil Glinda.  Along the way, he picks up as traveling companions the more or less helpful flying monkey Finley and a little girl made of china.  He will confront Glinda (Michelle Williams), only to find that he has been misled about the true state of affairs in Oz.  A reluctant Oz will be asked to help set things right.  Oz might not be the wizard they expected, but he might be the wizard they need.  The end is frightful and suspenseful, as Oz pits his illusions and misdirection against the real magic of the witches...<br /><br />James Franco does a nice job as a guy who allows himself to be talked into doing the right thing.  Michelle Williams does an equally nice job as the witch who sees Oz as he is, yet believes in the person he could become.  Recommended.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|True to life interactive game. Better than most. Love it. The only thing against it is that there is no &quot;help&quot; tab inside the game so there's no way to get help on some things- such as why you can complete a competition with a full score of perfects and still only get 3rd place.

It's a stunning accomplishment, while it may lack in some story, it's still a good watch! The visual is what's gonna' blow you away and the action sequences are great as well.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this for the whole family! Guys, consider yourselves forewarned, at the no-shirt scene, I had to sit through that awkward moment with my girlfriend where she makes me realize my excess fat may not be as sexy as she led me to believe! lol

I couldn't believe all the detail I was missing.<br /><br />10/10
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Loved the movie.  Even though it was &#34;Based on a true story&#34;  I know Bob Anders. Glad it won all of those awards.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|A different game for sure, wasn't really aware of what Slenderman was (and I'm surprised there hasn't been a movie made---yet) but it's certainly creepy, helped by the black &amp; white gameplay &amp; ominous soundtrack. My 6 year-old was curious so I let her watch a bit, soon she was frightened &amp; begging me to delete it from my KFHD, later on she had difficulty sleeping, so for sure not a game for the small fry lol.

B00356CO1E|5.0|I just finished day two of level 1 and I'm ecstatic! What a sweat for only 25 minutes! I downloaded this to my computer because for $4.99, what could I loose (I mean other than lbs)?! I've never tried a JM workout before, but I've been a fan of her on the BL since the beginning! Boy does she deliver! I'm a hefty gal at 5'2\\" and 198 lbs, however to say I'm completely sedentary would be inaccurate. I'm 21 years old and work at a restaurant where I'm constantly buzzing about, hauling silverware, ceramic plates, ice buckets, and pushing towering cup racks. Of course to say I'm in any type of athletic shape is unfair too, but I want to make it clear that I don't sit at desk. So grossly overweight, armed with only an old yoga mat, I attempted this workout yesterday and made it out on the other side alive. I had to take a few brief breaks, tried to keep 'em less than 5 seconds like Jillian said, but I never became discouraged or quit. I think it probably helped that I didn't have weights the first day, as it kept pressure off my unconditioned chest. Sweaty and gross after completing the workout, I ran upstairs for a quick shower. The entire rest of the day I was bouncing with energy, and I didn't feel sore in the slightest. Of course I felt quite different this morning! Every muscle ached upon waking an hour ago. Almost decided not to do the workout again, because I have a double today at the restaurant and know I'm going to be tired. But then I thought, hey, 30 days ain't nothing. If I choose, yesterday could be the day I changed it all. So I put JM on. And I thought I wouldn't make it through the first circuit. But I did, albeit I struggled through soreness with the strength training (I went out and bought 3 lb dumbbells yesterday). And then I breezed through the last two circuits. Okay. So maybe not breezed. But I made it through the cardio without breaking, and that's HUGE for a little lifetime asthmatic like me. I've made it my mission to do this for 30 days, 10 days of each level. Perhaps around day 15 and definitely at day 30 I'll revise this with an update of what I hope will be great results! But as of right now, to others, I must say there's no good reason to not expend the $4.99 on this little gem!of each level. Perhaps around day 15 and definitely at day 30 I'll revise this with an update of what I hope will be great results!

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Definitely not an action film...akin to &#34;The Days of Wine and Roses&#34;.  Very good leading performance, but the film was a drag.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|got this as a gift from my brother, and its odd humor but funny. if you like comedians like eddie izzard, then you will most likely enjoy this book
B0000029DD|5.0|I only wish I would have discovered him and his wonderfully artistic music before he died.  I would have loved to see him in concert.  He is amazing.  My daughter, who is a music teacher, could accurate describe what I&#34;m trying to say about his technique and music style, but he's so amazingly talented, I can't get enough of his haunting voice and his range, and his guitar skills.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Ok, I have trouble with this game as there are absolutely no instructions on how to move around, how to change directions...Once I ended up having to move down the road backwards because I couldn't get off the control so I could turn around. I wish there were instructions on how to navigate!  Drives me nuts. Other than that I think most of the reviews stating people were scared to death etc, must be fake reviews put in by the creators and/or distributor. Not any scarier than any other game that involves a timer.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|If you are a Paul Simon fan, everyone should have this in their music catalog.  It's a great CD.  I'm glad I got this.
B000FFJYB6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Takes you back to when times were simple. It's a beautiful family story. Loved it!
1451673442|5.0|I love her and her books.  All you nay sayers, say what you will, but if you get even just one self help tip out of her book (and trust me, there's way more than one), it's all worth it.  What she has to say about the law of attraction may seem obvious to some, or maybe some have never heard of what you think is what you attract, so you must think positive, be grateful and spread love, but you know what?  No matter if it's this book that calls you to do it, or through your own spiritual source, the ideas in this book are only positive and if more people followed them, the world would be a much better place.  I know when I follow these rules to live by, I feel so much better and my life is better too.  These daily exercises help teach and enforce how to be grateful in your every day life.  And what's nice is you can always refer back to a particular exercise if you need some work on that particular topic in your life.
B0087DFIYA|3.0|Mel gets mixed up with the daily bruhaha of a Mexican prison.<br /><br />Mel Gibson = as awesome as ever<br />movie = absolutely ridiculous<br /><br />In fact, it's so ridiculous you may actually enjoy it.  At the very least, you will enjoy watching Mel as a bad ass.
1439181780|5.0|Having read The Secret, and The Magic, in that order, I just got this one.  This is probably the best.  If you don't have love, you don't have anything.  It's where it all starts.  It's the foundation of everything, including gratitdue.  You need to learn to love and then everything falls into place.  It's simple.  These are ideas we probably all know, but this book, puts them all in order in an easy to read book that serves as a guide to learn to live by.  I am grateful for these books.  If everyone followed these principles, the world would be like John Lennon's song, Imagine :-)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book delivered a thoughtful story that makes you feel your response.  However, there was little to discover because the story is very predictable.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm hooked on this series.  It is so popular we could not ever get even one of the discs at any of the Family Video stores in our area.  It has been worth it us to have it without any time limit.
B005HCI72O|5.0|This is the third time I have read this series and I love it everytime. The story line is great and you can imagine the scenes and the people in your mind.
B0053O89RY|5.0|The third season does not dissapoint.  I can count on a few good belly laughs every time I watch an episode.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Really love the story. They would really make a great mini television series from these books. Kepp it up Diana.
B00007L4OM|5.0|hard to find in English Language It is a awesome Action Packed film . Jean Reno is underrated as an actor his range is elite. Great movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is a great show. Scary with a good story. I can't wait for the next season in Amazon Instant Video.
B0086DBE62|5.0|Loved the film.  Julia Roberts plays the wicked queen with such style, reminding me of Shakespeare's Richard III character.  The action is done wonderfully and the surprise ending is delightful especially with the cameo role of Sean Bean. Only the &#34;puppy love&#34; was a little over the top.
0316069434|5.0|Danish journalist Anneke Jespersen is found in a dark Los Angeles alley, dead of an execution style gunshot wound.  It happens during the Rodney King riots in 1992 and young homicide detective, Harry Bosch, is on the scene.  But he doesn't have the time to fully investigate her murder so nothing is done until twenty years later when the case lands in the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit.  Harry is now a member of this unit and takes up the case again with a strong and obsessive desire to solve the crime and avenge Anneke's murder.<br /> Author Michael Connelly has done it again, constructing a thrilling story about the painstaking procedures that a detective must follow when picking up a case that is colder than an Arctic winter.  Thanks to modern forensic methods and enhanced technical capabilities, Harry is able to dig up the tiniest of clues as he recreates the circumstances of the night when Jespersen was killed.<br /> Along the way, we learn more about Harry's relationship with his daughter, Maddie, a teen who is years wiser than her age.  She's expressed a keen interest in police work and Harry's ready and able to give her selected glimpses of what law enforcement is about.  But he has to balance his fatherly concerns with increasing attention to his police work.  Harry also has to cope with bureaucracy in the form of an overbearing and egotistical lieutenant who's trying to mold the unit to his style.  Lieutenant O'Toole (called The Tool and O'Fool by squad members) is more concerned with statistics than having his detectives perform effectively.<br /> Harry takes a huge risk while pursuing leads that take him away from Los Angeles.  But it all comes together in a credible and exciting finish.  I've read most of Connelly's books and this is one of his best.
B000FCK65W|4.0|I have read many of this type of book lately. Unfortunately, there remains many in our country who still<br />I've this way!
B000I8G5B2|5.0|Great movie I love Jude law goes to show u even in a prefect world their is no such thing.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|A great read!<br />Another very enjoyable book by Ken Follett<br />As usual, it is well researched and beautifully written with well drawn characters<br />Can hardly wait for the third volume
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It shows how our Goverment has went from the individual to the common good mentality. Sad! I don't read much, but could not stop reading this book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Reminiscent of the Manchurian Candidate, the twists and turns keep you coming back for more! Can't wait to order the next season!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I thought it was amazing!!  It had a really good ending!  It didnt scare me but I watch it during the day but if I had watch it at night it would have freaked me out!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun for everyone and cheaper than a real horse. Would recommend this to anyone whose child wants a horse but can't afford one.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I liked all the case studies.  It made it easy to read and understand.  Also I learned a lot about habits.  Why we need them and how we can change those we don't like.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|For the dedicated reader who went through all of the Alex Rider adventures this is the perfect ending. This thriller kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. It Is a great book
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This app is literally one of my favorites. At first I thought the game was boring but I got into it second after. The concept of staying away and finding its what makes this such a success! I got to go play more now! Just thought I'd leave a review!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I've never read this book before and I loved it however I can't say this is my favorite book. It was good though :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this all the time. It lets you know how much time you have left for almost every application.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I would rate this book a 9. It held your interest with suspense and intrigue. Would definitely recommend to others. Am looking forward to his second book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The game takes you to different levels and test you. It is good for hand and eye coordination. Simply put the game is great.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric Burdon is one of the most under appreciated artist's that originated in the 60's.  Under appreciated maybe by all except by those that have followed his career.  The original Animals, the New Animals, Eric Burdon and the Animals, and War, ETC. all created exceptional music that still sounds fresh.  With each step Eric brought something new to the table.  The blues of the original Animals through the R & B/Funk of War, and beyond.<br /><br />Eric, always an excellent song writer, had a penchant for writing songs that captured a time.  Think:  Monterey, San Francisco Nights, Sky Pilot, Winds of Change, and White Houses to name a few.  The new album offers another excellent addition to the list for 'Forever 27'.<br /><br />Eric along with the Animals actually are responsible for introducing me to Bo Diddley.  'The Story of Bo Diddley' was the first song on the first Animals album, The Animals'.<br /><br />Eric's passion for Bo Diddley continues with this album.  Riddin' on that 'Bo Diddley Special' is a great tribute to and old and admired friend.  For those with the need to compare, the music of Eric's new album is closer to the Original Animals.  Not to say the sound is dated or stale.  It is quite the opposite. This release captures it all, great blues, great lyrics, great arrangements, tight band, varied styles, and perhaps most importantly Eric's great soulful voice.<br /><br />Each song on 'Til Your River Runs Dry' is excellent.<br /><br />'Til Your River Runs Dry' will be a welcome addition to anyone's music collection.  It will be an especially welcomed addition to the collection of those that have appreciated any of Eric's music through the years.  There are reminders of those different stages throughout this album.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Very eye opening about the food industry and how they come to market. It is very interesting how government subsidized food rules the market

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Megan Scott is a fairly level headed woman, tired of gone wrong romance, decides that she doesn't need a man to get the life she wants and craves.  She heads to Vegas for a wedding.  Her, not so friendly, friends push her to try and pick up someone.  She finds Conner Reed and tries to use him to simply get them off her case.  After a long night of drinking.  She awakens.  Married.  For Conner this is the ultimate wife,  Everything he had been searching for he found in Megan.  But in the early light of day, and without the alcohol daze, Megan's sense kicks in.<br /><br />Can Conner keep the level headed, detached wife of his dreams?  Will Megan really stay in a marriage to someone she knew for one night?  Do either of them actually know what they want?  Will they Get it?<br /><br />I truly compelling read.  That keeps the pages turning until you get to the end.  A great story.  Not just for the price but for the content.
B000FVQYT0|5.0|It was great to add this old favorite to my collection and was received in a timely fashion. Love it!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|It is so awesome and easier to understand and to read~  just like being at home but mobile:)  You guys did good on this.
B007REV4T8|3.0|I think this movie was not as good as the other Bond movies that Daniel Craig has appeared in; however, I gave it three stars  because some of the chase scenes had some unique properties. To elaborate would spoil those chases for others.<br /><br />I have seen other movies where Craig plays a role other than Bond and appreciated him more in those.<br /><br />I still love the line he gave to a bartender's question about mixing his drink, &#34;Shaken or stirred?&#34;.  Bond [Craig's] reply, &#34;Ask me if I give a damn.&#34; [That wasn't in this movie.]
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is the first time I have read anything by Lee Child.  I ejoyed the slow methodical way he presents his characters, to give them depth.  I look forward to reading more of his work and plan on continuing the adventures of Jack Reacher!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel in the movie has a problem.  His acting is five star.<br /><br />He plays a pilot in this movie that has flying abilities (even with his drinking problem) are superior to most other pilots.  I don't want to spoil the plot for others.  I'll just say that while under the influence he is faced with an equipment break down in the airplane he piloting that results in him having to crash land.  Only the fact that he was a great pilot and that his natural ability took over was he able to land rather that crash with loss of all lives on board.<br /><br />There were, however, deaths and injuries and as in all cases for airplane incidents an investigation.<br /><br />Denzel's character shows himself to be both weak (in his addiction to drugs and alcohol) and morally strong (in not blaming crew members and recognizing and admitting his problems).
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great story about the men who sacrifice to keep our country free.  Thank you for your service and stay safe.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Those other comments are not true I mean maybe for a phone. It you don't want to get this on a kindle because it breaks down.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I'll admit, I'm only 14, but some of the thing can be considered confusing at times. Either way, I'm going to re-read it to understand it, other than that... I'm so sad it's over!
0062014536|2.0|Everything until the ending was great! I feel like there should be a book after this or any way of closure. All the characters' story was left opened, I can't see any reason why that is. Please finish the book! You can't put a cliffhanger at the end of the last book!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like using my phone as my alarm clock, but this is a little nicer, and  very easy to use. I love that I can load in songs and use it as a sleep timer! Thanks for making a great app!
B008OOYALE|3.0|I do love this game, I just wish that team lava and Amazon would work together<br />and get us the updates everyone else has! It's infuriating that we KINDLE users<br />are so far behind.
B003U51D58|5.0|We enjoyed the entire series. It was not an easy show to figure out so that kept us guessing. Recommend to people over 13 only.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I &lt;3 minecraft! SO WORTH THE SEVEN dallors! Trust me! Look at my name people! If you can't sorry! I got this game for a week and I built a mansion in three days!

B0027MJU00|3.0|Lets just say it was not as good as Gone Girl!  Kept me riveted, however! This is not one for the ages!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|For fans of the genre or anyone who likes excessive violence, this movie delivers. H & G takes place in a fictional world where witches, trolls, and dark magic are a very real threat. Enter Hansel and Gretel all grown up and nursing one hell of a grudge against witches. A routine job to find some missing children turns into something much more sinister. This is, simply stated, an adult fairy-tale. Violence, gore, evil witches, a troll, even a little t and a. As the rating suggests, this is not your Grimm fairy-tale but it is one fun ride from start to finish.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the twists and turns, they took me completely by surprise! Like many readers I was unfulfilled by the ending!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Great book - I read a hard copy about 2 years ago, and just stumbled upon it again and i wanted to buy it so i can read it again. I dont read many books but this i really enjoyed it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is great viewing for families with adult children. My daughter is nineteen and she watches with my husband and I.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Great DVD for the family!!!! Kids will love it!!! Very good upgrade to Peter Pan!!! Good quality for the money!!!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is a wonder of a game very emotional and heart warming at times. The artistic value of this game is priceless in my opinion. My experience with this product is one that I will always remember. I was lucky enough to have encountered 6 people throughout the journey which have accompanied me through various levels. My interpretation on this is that we are lost just like everyone else and through the Journey which we can associate with life we discover things and find meaning to what we are and what others are. We can differentiate between what can harm us and what can help us. At times it may feel bleak as you are in on enviroment and at another you may feel the change in ambiance. A truly beautiful game, not like your average FPS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it very hood game great for all ages my kids love it too. I could play for hours.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers are cool first it was regular that Rio now it's Rome i always wonder what's next on subway surfers no virus or anything first i thought it was lame now its off the chains
B00942X8PY|5.0|This game is very enjoyable. It has fun graphics and sounds. It really makes you think. I definitely am enjoying it. It certainly helps get the mind going. Nice job devs!
B000687M48|4.0|Better experience in live music prformance, and DVR bonus a plus. Must have for your collection. Other's charge up to $39.00 for this set. Great deal.
0007105045|5.0|I have never so heavily notated a book I read for school, I have never felt less like reading was assigned, and I have never been happier to go back and read it again and still have my annotations and the wonderful text. Tree and Leaf is fantastic all for learning about Tolkien, for hearing what he had to say, and just for a good read. It is all of these things. Really, really great. If you're not sure, buy this--and buy the hard copy--you'll want to make notes.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I am ready to read point of retreat. It kept my attention. Easy read after a long day. On to the next...
0880796863|5.0|Been learning on this deck for 6 or 7 seven years (it wasn't my first deck, but it was the first deck I was able to get serious with). I have helped so many people with this, and helped myself out of so many ruts. My deck and I have developed a very special relationship I wouldn't trade for anything. When I look at the art of this deck next to, say, the tarot of the new vision (another favorite of mine, thought I suggest purchasing this one first), the RWS looks very crude, but when I see it by itself it takes my breath away with its beauty. There is something more than nostalgia in this deck that makes it just incredibly special. It's like it breathes, I think, and as you're getting to know it you feel like you're getting to know Pamela Colman-Smith, the woman who drew it, and as you read about it you can kind of get to know Arthur Waite. If the artwork, detail, and sheer amount of thought that went into this deck aren't already enough, I recommend it for students of tarot simply because there is so much scholarship on this deck, so many resources to turn to.<br /><br />I recently purchased this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend (we actually met over a tarot reading). He's been fascinated with tarot for many years and has done some independent study but did not own a deck of his own--of course he loves it.<br /><br />The book that comes with is irritating in its organization and because of it's size (hard to hold open, etc, but to be fair the size is also convenient), but the content is good (obviously, it's Waite). The box is one of the greatest things ever, because it doesn't fall apart quickly like the cardboard envelope boxes do, and it's light and compact considering.<br /><br />With tarot decks, it's usually a very personal thing, but I feel no inhibition saying BUY THIS DECK.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have  read my physical copy of The Secret Garden so many times that I should know I  by heart. I really love how the story shows readers the impact of positive and negative thinking. Colin, with the help of Mary, Dickon and the Secret Garden, had to learn positive reinforcement in order to overcome the negative thoughts put in his head by the adults who were around him.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I must say - I was skeptical at best when a friend of mine told me I had to check out this show about zombies.  I'm a huge horror movie nut but zombies were always a cliché in films and I had no reason to think that this show would be any different.  Boy was I wrong!!!  I was hooked after the first episode of season 1 and I've been wanting more ever since!  I highly recommend ALL seasons of The Walking Dead to anyone (who doesn't mind a little blood and gore, that is).  Look beyond the zombies into the meaning of the show - and you'll be hooked too!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was amazing! One of the best books I have read in a very long time!  Very interesting full of detail and you can't put it down!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|U thought this game was slot of fun as a matter of fact u plan on buying it. It keeps you thinking in other words it's not a mindless game that you don't need any brains for and still fun and relaxing.<br />A very busy mother of 6
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An amazing insight into the world of the SEALs and the reality of modern assymetirical warfare. Told like it is, and in black and white terms. Sometimes brutally frank, especially about himself and his failings. Made all the more poignant by the circumstances of his recent death.
B009AOFNU4|5.0|Works great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab2. Hardly any lag with bluetooth. Used it to play MAME, SNES, NES and NeoGeo emulator games. Nice, solid quality build.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Amazing you can do many things such as test your skills to the max and time your self , best way to<br />get that bordness out of your system or for just<br />fun
B003S5K8GK|4.0|Typical movie of him without as much dancing Bollywood style but the essence of this movie didn't call for that. As a Muslim here in the US, I DO feel discrimination everyday....from parents at my son (who IS Autistic so this struck a cord also) to even going to visit family further South....I can't begin to describe the headaches I go thru to come home from an airport in VA....because I wear hijab...and only that. My name isn't 1 that would trigger everyone to go &#34;oh, no Muslim!&#34;....it's how I dress modestly that bothers them. Don't Christians portray Mary the Mother of Jesus who we also honor in Islam as having her hair covered? And in case anyone failed to notice, every other major act of violence here in the US for many many years was not related to Muslims or Islam in any way! It is always people who have their minds messed up who commit these horrible acts not people who truly honor their faith. My faith IS one of peace and one were I am to submit to Allah (who is called Allah by Christians in Arabic countries also by the way).<br />Basically, this movie should, and that is SHOULD, carry the meaning that no one should be pre-judged by their name or color or anything else but rather solely by their OWN actions.
B00935KWWO|3.0|I will start by saying that I do believe that Plume is the best Twitter client available for Android.  It has a rich feature set, including extensive support for multiple user accounts, robust customization, and advanced features such as muting and good support for search and lists.<br /><br />I have to downgrade my rating here on the Amazon Store due to the unfortunate decision by the developer not to offer the premium, ad-free paid version of the application here. When asked on Twitter if it would eventually be available here, their one word answer was &quot;unlikely&ldquo;.  The ads do tend to be intrusive on my Kindle Fire, particularly when used to the ad-free experience on my phone.  If the premium version were offered, I would consider Plume to be a 5 star app.

6304711891|3.0|the only reason i got this movie was for the price.<br />it did not show up on time.<br />Sean Connery is the only good actor in this.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Shin Dong Hyuk's story is an eye-opener.  I have always known that things were bad in North Korea, but I had no idea how bad.  My first reaction is that it is a global crime to let this go on.  My second reaction is to admire the incredible survival of Shin and his ability to recapture his humanity.  I appreciate the way author Blaine Harden also explains the broad view of North Korea as Shin's unique life unfolded.  It makes his accomplishment even more remarkable when you understand how impossible it was.
0739376969|5.0|A fantastic book to help you chance in times where you can not see the whole.<br />It will help you to Change.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely loved all three seasons...have watched it twice and cannot wait for season four. If you love historical dramas you will love this.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Exiting suspenseful and full of action this book definitely deserves 5 stars and more.  The maze tuner trilogy and prequel all deserve 5 stars. James Dashner is a amazing author and I expect him to right new classic novels.
B0028RXXE8|3.0|Five stars for the set, the costuming,  and the buildings!  All of it in this movie were superb! I can readily see the vast expense the producers and directors went to in filming Rome; they spared no expense, spared no detail.  All I can say is, if I had what the set for this movie cost in my checking account, I would be one happy camper.  All the critiques I read of this movie raved about it and thus prompted me to purchase the entire series.  My wife and I watched it together over a period of several days.<br /><br />And we were both quite disappointed.<br /><br />I gave the film three stars only because the costuming and sets were beyond phenomenal. I had expected to see a story of the Roman people perhaps covering several generations, something akin to “The Rise and Fall of The Roman Empire”,  but this was not to be;  instead, we watched an X-rated soap opera rife with family dysfunction, treachery, betrayal, coarse profanity, brutal violence, and graphic (and sometimes brutal) sex as stated by the editorial review. As far as I could tell, that is all there basically was to the entire story. The tale meandered hither, thither and yon and I waited in vain for the real point to the story, for the real climax, but the only climax I saw were the ones achieved by the Roman characters on the screen.  The story line had no real defined point and, for hours on end over 11 CD’s,  just ambled and meandered from one incident to another, heartthrob to heartthrob, with no real reason or point to the story. At times, it was difficult to follow what was going on with some of the scenarios which I felt were injected perhaps as fillers from time to time to flesh out the allotted time, punctuated by crude sex, full nudity and foul language.  Yes, in human life, all these things are certainly a reality, but when one pays some $50 plus another $6.00 shipping and handling, I expected at least a story of some worth to accompany all this murder, nudity, flesh and desire. Alas, but this was not to be.<br /><br />While it more or less held my interest, the story dragged on and on, slowly, never achieving any point in particular, jumping from one incident to another, and then suddenly ended as the bodies of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra were paraded by on a cart while the Romans looked on.  I was left with the feeling, “I watched all these hours and it ends like this? Did the camera suddenly run out of film?”<br /><br />For those who enjoy the daily soap operas, with sex, cheating, nudity and so on ad nauseum, then Rome is for you.  However, please note there certainly isn’t much of a story to it and definitely not worth fifty bucks.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I absolutley love this game. It is the highlight of my day. I am one of those people who like to get scared! So never look back you'll die
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Great movie but not for kids! :) The content was about death and dealing with it. In the end, things get really weird but all is well. Probably turned our girl into a goth kid. j/k
B009NQKPUW|4.0|A rare, quality sci-fi movie that`s not a Star Wars pin ball machine type movie, or someone in a rubber monster suit.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love that you can choose a random or a winning deal and I love that the game asks &quot;do you want to auto complete&quot;!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Excellent book, full of very interesting stories.<br /><br />I wanted to go run every time I read it.<br /><br />Only 1 warning: minimalist running is not for everyone, and it should be faced as a slow process. I bought a 5Fingers, started running a lot with it, and eventually my leg started to ache.<br /><br />Then I bought Runner's World Essential Guides: Barefoot Running and Minimalism, and then I understood some very important things about minimalism...
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|First experienced Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean in the 25th Anniversary concert of Les Miserables. He absolutely took my breath away and opened my eyes and mind to a new world of music.
0307341577|5.0|Dark places is wonderful. While it might seem a little slow at first this book picks up fast and is hard to put down. I usually read romantic novels and this book was a great change of pace.  While I have to admit Flynn's writing is sometimes vulgar, gruesome and violent, I can't stop reading her books. I couldn't believe how it ending and can't wait for her next book to come out! If you liked Gone Girl, this is a must read! I have read all three of Flynn's book now and I have to admit that they are all equally thrilling and must reads!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite books off all time. Well written and very relatable. I loved it!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Great series, love the actors, Costumes,cars & just about everything else. Amazing to see how many wealthy Englishmen really lived in days before WWI
B00A17P7OQ|5.0|I guess this is a must see movie if you saw Yossi and Jagger.  Nice production and locations during the entire movie.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Loved this series as much as seasons 1 & 2. Hated to see 2 of my favorite characters go but look forward to new characters in season 4. Loved Shirley McClain & am delighted she will be back next season.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Well I'm a fan of modern family so I will continue to buy every season.  Great show that teaches the importance of family.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The best show every.....can't wait until the next season starts!!! Love the show!!! Don't like how season 3 ended. Will hope for the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005M91K|3.0|I was hoping for a movie experience which was as compelling and entertaining as Chronus - but Baraka left me oddly depressed and wanting more.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Bought it for the wife for three kings day.  She likes it, keeps me out of trouble.  I think I should of got her the digital version.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I had seen a few shows on my local public broadcasting station and enjoyed them very much.  I decided to purchase the set so I could enjoy them whenever I wanted.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|As always the team at Rovia have pulled it off! This is the 3rd iteration of the Angry Birds franchise and is uber fun. Though this game is more geared toward the younger audiences (like all animated bird destruction games are) it's still challenging, fun, and makes great use of new game mechanics that really perks up it's playability. Thanks guys, now it's time to teach some green piggies a lesson.....
B009KY5OGC|4.0|I found this book most distressing, but am enthralled by the Historical facts.. It appears to me ( the reader) that once Religion & White Man's so called &#34; Good Will & Power comes into the fore of situations, the original Natives loses all site of their Heritage, Cutoms and Life... The same can be said of all traditional Natives whether it be Hawaiian, Native Indian, Aboriginal or First Nations' Peoples.... It is so very sad that it is still going on today in this century... Iwished that we could learn from Children who seem to overcome all of this and learn, play and love one another... then I'm being Idealistic.
B00005OAID|5.0|It's so wonderful that vinyl is making a comeback, ain't it? Ok, personal feelings of nostalgia aside this record is great. This is John Mayer's first record and really hits what makes him a good singer songwriter. A little sophomoric, yeah, but still good music that you can relate to while also remember what excellent songwriting and exceptional guitar playing is all about. Moreover, the vinyl aspect of this record is perfect. Heavy weigh vinyl. High quality music. Excellently lined and well produced slip cover with pictures and lyrics.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A very simple game with very few features. The game works fine and if you don't care about frills, you would probably think the game is ok.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Uber fun game! Love the graphics. Lots of challenging game play and interesting power ups make this enjoyable little game a must have for all smart phone users.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch. A much more modern version of the 007 series. Would surely watch it again which is something I  rarely do.
B007GE2H3G|1.0|Best CG ever. Story is super BORING. Took me 3 days to finish. Reminds me why I quit reading the comic books.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|You'll enjoy Beautiful Disaster.  I bit less detailed, but still difficult to put down once you start reading.  Waiting for the sequel!!
B009CF7GRY|4.0|It was a good movie to watch on arainy afternoon.  The story follwed some of the original story lines. The dancing was better but some scenes werenot as good as the original.  Would  watch it again probably.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|very entertaining and well done. would highly recommend. great characters and story line. masterpiece theater at its best in my opinion.
B008Q00KEW|5.0|i LOVE SCI-FI.  Had many great and energetic action scenes.  I can never get enough of Star Trek or any oa these action movies.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|Keane is such good melancholy music and this album does not disappoint. Its one of our favorites  mp3 download made it easy.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is so entertaining.Its a game anyone can play.My daughter took it away from me while I was playing it.She loves it also.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Coldplay is the best and this album is really good. We downloaded it and were playing the songs in minutes.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Interesting concept but the game is difficult to control. It is difficult to switch between the moving icon to just being able to view around you. I had a glitch when running around on the \\"road\\" level where all of sudden I fell \\"through\\" the graphics and my screen went white. Upon exiting the game and going back into it, I was brought back to the white screen. I like the idea of running from the slender man and collecting the notes, but the game lacks any kind of a story line. The game would be better if you could actually read/view the notes that you collect in some kind of in game inventory as well. I gave the game two stars, graphics are good, but the rest needs work.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This may be among the best bad films ever. It is such a stunning train wreck that one has to see it to believe it. What were they thinking? Phoenix and Hoffman are both great actors but someone seems to have been drinking the Master's Kool Aid or anti-freeze to think this would fly. Yet, it is disturbingly on target, given the subject matter, but painfully dull, like its inspiration. Phoenix's character's \\"ick\\" factor is so of the charts that one wonders if he'll carry the Freddie's baggage from here on out. Hope not, for his career's sake. Time for a shower and a deprogramming.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Yo it is so cool yay and if you want the world's largest online marketing campaign to get me the world's leading provider.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game.  But I think was too short and a little expensive at $4.99 to unlock full version.  Don't let the word &quot;free&quot; hook you.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I am on the first level and I've been in the water a long time.It is so cool stuff like this one
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Trying the free trial and was really enjoying till I got stuck with the safe in the managers office... hint keeps sending me there but won't let me go further. Really disappointing glitch :o(
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this game is cool but can be better. Things are kind of all the same. I recommend this for you and your friends.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I have enjoyed the ASOIAF series thus far. They are certainly a good break from the monotony of Non-Fiction books I read. In fact, in the past 2 years, this is only the 2nd Non-Fiction series of books I've read.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is not my \\"type\\" of book. I enjoy books that are plot-heavy as opposed to character-heavy. This series is definitely character heavy. For example, a soap opera is character heavy. The plot can twist and turn at any given point, because the emphasis is primarily on the characters and what they do/what their reactions are/how they deal with situations. LOTR, on the other hand, is a book that's primarily focused on a plot. The main difference between a plot driven and character driven story is the emphasis.<br /><br />To me, this series reads like a soap opera. The events are at the discretion of the authors mind. In a character-heavy book, twists and turns are dished out frequently. The author is not beholden to a plot...it provides a lot more freedom and flexibility to GRRM. This is a double edged sword; a twist and turn every now and then is healthy and important to keep the book flowing. This is especially true of a series that is this voluminous and wide. However, too many twists and earth shattering changes results in not only desensitizing the reader, but you (as the author) also suffer from a loss of credibility. It's the law of diminishing returns. And in my humble opinion, GRRM \\"pushes the envelope\\" a bit too often. By the end of book three, he had lost all credibility with me. I was not only very accurately predicting what would happen next, but that initial shock of Ned Stark's death (something which, at the time, I thought was not only brave of the author but also a refreshing change) just seemed like a cheap trick to keep me reading.<br /><br />While I do NOT want to make this review a comparison between ASOIAF and LOTR, my honest opinion is that the penmanship is a LOT better in LOTR. In hindsight, the fact that Tolkien never resorted to cheap tricks and huge plot changes in order to draw his readers in is to be commended.<br /><br />Now to the positives...the book IS a good change of pace. If you love never-ending sagas, then this should certainly do it for you. There ARE a lot of plot twists and turns that should keep you enthralled with the book at least through books one to three. Unlike other people who think this book moves too slowly, I thought the pace was quite exhilarating.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would strongly suggest that you at least try book one and see if it's for you. If you're at all into the fantasy/medieval genre, then definitely give it a try. Similarly, if you like epics that are more than 1000 pages long, this book is worth a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing. You will be so motivated and mesmerized by this game. I have one complaint, some of the missions in it are so hard. But otherwise this is a great game. GET IT!!!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a great movie, I'd recommend it to anyone. It is a good one to watch with your mom.
034580404X|5.0|love the story!!!!! have read it twice!! will read again. and have shared it with several friends . ....love it. wish the story continued.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Definitely worth the $30 I paid for it. All of the bits are perfect quality, and it even includes the proprietary Nintendo screw bit.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Very good writing.  This book kept me interested and engaged, which is not an easy task.  I'm looking forward to reading more by Elizabeth Haynes.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|To anyone who enjoys Patricia's story line, this one kept me wanting to keep reading to find what the twist of the story might be
B006LSZECO|5.0|Don't read reviews, just buy the book and dive in. There's just too much in this novel that could be ruined, and what a loss that would be for the reader. So I won't even allude to any twists, I will simply recommend this book and give it 5 stars bc I can't give it 10.<br />This was my first Gillian Flynn novel (her 3rd), so I immediately read her other two. While they were all wonderful, Gone Girl is definitely her masterpiece. In GG, her writing ability caught up with her devilishly clever ideas. Her second novel \\"Dark Places\\" is built around a genius idea (the \\"kill club\\" element), but doesn't quite have the tight pacing of Gone Girl, which is flawless.<br />Now that I've finished all of her books, I'm not sure what to read next! It's always hard to follow a great book. I'll spend the first few chapters of whatever I read next feeling annoyed that Gone Girl is all gone (,girl!).<br />Until the movie, that is. GF is writing the screenplay as I write this review. Fun!!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|You know those albums that have one GREAT song and the rest are blah? This isn't one of those. The entire album is fantastic.
B005R7FOPC|5.0|Great edition with footnotes and no mistakes. Thanks for making this available for free.<br />Très bonne édition avec notes et pas d'erreurs. Merci de la gratuité de cet ouvrage.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|If you could save relays ot would be the single greatest game of he android market. Also has a few bugs but its the best 99 cents i have spend in the appstore.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|i just started and fun so far monkey is really cute kinda scary. can see why so many like this game.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I would recommend this book for and to anyone going through bad times. Frankl teaches us to appreciate bad times and pull from them their unexpected opportunities for growth. Amazing book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazing!!!!!  I Could not put this book down n I  can't wait to read the rest of the series!!!  Such a gripping storyline
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Really entertaining.  Kept my attention the entire time and had some great twists.  If you like scifi time travel, you will love it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Mr. Makos and his team compiled droves of data and delivered it in a fresh engaging narrative.  It's great to to keep these heroes in the forefront.  &#34;A Higher Call&#34; is a fitting title to the human perspective of war involving this fateful mission.  I look forward to the next book by Mr. Makos.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Finally one for Ben Affleck.  It was a really great film.  Although not my favorite Ben movie.  I think The Town was a better movie over all, but this was really good.
1567184855|5.0|This is the second copy of this book that I've purchased.<br />This one is a gift for a friend.<br />A great concept.<br />Fast shipping.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book so much. Colleen Hoover is my new favorite author. Her writing is so true to life and really makes you think.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|I've always enjoyed movies with knights and Medieval subjects. When I saw this film in the theater, when in grammar school, I fell in love with Robert Wagner. So, this particular movie has been a sentimental favorite of mine. To be honest, it's no &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34;, as far as quality goes. But, it is fun and has a great cast. It's great to see these stars, Robert Wagner & Janet Leigh, when they were very young and &#34;up and coming&#34; stars. Also, this is a wonderful film for the whole family; and there aren't many of those these days.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I was lucky enough to meet Ayrton Senna behind the scenes and found him to very kind and personal human being.  At the time the media was painting a different picture.  I feel this movie sets the record straight.  I enjoyed and recommend this movie.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|As everyone must know by now, this is a prequel to John Carpenter's &#34;The Thing&#34;. I was impressed by all of the attention to detail that went into meshing what happens in this film to what the characters in the JC version find when they go to the Norwegian camp. Along with that, it was terrifc the way they ended it to seamlessly stop where the JC version begins. Of course, the advent of CGI gives this film more leaway with the special effects, which are truly frightening. The cast is a major plus, as they all seem to git in with each other and the acting is superb. I especially liked the bit of levity when the Norwegians start singing and dancing to an old Norwegian tune. It was hilarious. As in the original, you are still kept guessing who the real humans are and who isn't. Also, the fate of the last survivor is very ambiguous; leaving an opening for a sequel?? I recommend this to all who loved the JC version, but not for children.
B00942X8PY|5.0|I wasn't expecting the game to be this good. One reviewer complained that the game didnt come with instructions. Well, this game is so intuitive that it was designed not to require instructions! Thats a plus not being told the rules and letting  the player discover the world at their own pace. Love the music and crisp clean gameplay. Will recommend.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|The book definitely tied up all loose ends. Not generally my type of bood but I found I couldn't put it down anyway
B002GLSX8C|5.0|This movie is a must see experience. They are the mortal gods of rock music. They helped music come of age
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The main reason I bought this book was because I was trying to figure out why my Kindle wasn't buying or downloading anything, and then I accidentally downloaded this book. What an unbelievable stroke of luck, too!<br /><br />Anyway, just like most books I've read that originate in the Great Britain area (which basically comprises Harry Potter, and a couple others), this novel by Rachel Joyce started out with the general &#34;day-to-day life&#34; kind of atmosphere, almost as if you're just a stranger watching them go about their daily life; an atmosphere that might make you think If this book hadn't gotten so many 5-star ratings and good recommendations, I would've put it down by now.<br /><br />Little does Harold know, when he leaves to go to the post box, he won't be coming back for a long, long time. You see, he's about to receive a very shocking letter: one of his old coworkers, Queenie, is dying of cancer and doesn't know how long she has. With no friends or family, Harold's the last one left in her life even though they haven't spoken in decades. How could you even respond to a letter like that? Harold writes a short, formal reply and leaves to go put it in the mailbox.<br /><br />...But it's such a nice day, and he hasn't walked much further than the distance to the car in decades, so he decides to walk to the next box.<br />Or maybe the next one. Or maybe the post office. That's when he meets the girl at the garage.<br /><br />And that's how the adventure begins. You see, deep down inside him, Harold begins to believe against all logic that as long as he walks, Queenie must stay alive until he delivers the letter in person.<br /><br />Inspiring the rest of the world as they watch him do the impossible, Harold is soon walking to forgive himself for ruining his marriage, abandoning someone to which he owes a great deal, and perhaps most importantly, failing his beloved son David.<br /><br />I guess the whole point of this book - with all of its beautiful scenery, painful memories, and lessons in the art of coping - is to show the beauty in gathering the strength to put one foot in front of the other every single day. Just like Harold did with the people he met, I'll be carrying a piece of this book inside me as I go.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|Great story about young adults coping with their shapeshifting. Also lessons learned about decision-making ,relationships and love.....love for self, love for each other and love for human parents.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|The show has action (for my husband), intriguing characters (for me), and comedy to keep us both snickering and repeating funny lines every week.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Some viewers argue that this season is slower than others.  It is important to note the major character evolution taking place in the latest episodes!

B009VSW15Y|3.0|I haven't caught on to this yet. you have to point it at the person to get a picture - so far I've only taken pics of myself.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|The graphics and cont controls are good, nice and smooth. The game is terribly dumb though. You dont &quot;survive,&quot; rather aimlessly wonder around collecting pieces of paper, for some unknown reason, and avoid being seen by a skinny ghost. You can see him in the distance, so just change your direction. Not sure what you are surviving...
B00B1OEP32|5.0|I do not listen to Pop Music at all, this is my first pop album and I must say I truly enjoyed it, these tracks were very easy to listen to, quite pleasant in fact. I bought it with some MP3 Credit I had and do not regret my purchase for a moment! I think that Justin is quite a talented chap and this album not only demonstrates that but is also, I think, the beginning of his musical transition from a more generic, juvenile pop artist into a genuinely mature, unique and appealing musician. I should also mention that I find the renditions of \\"Boyfriend\\" and \\"Beauty and A Beat\\" contained herein to be more enjoyable that the studio/music video versions; these acoustic renditions allow you to appreciate Justin's talent, writing and artistry and not be distracted by the arguably ostentatious spectacle that so often cheapens or obfuscates the experience of modern music. I look forward to his next album and the further maturation of what is already an exceptional voice!
B004GYY714|5.0|I am surprised by how much I like this app. I rarely turn on my radio anymore -- just use this on my first-generation Kindle Fire, plugged into my stereo or boombox. Lots of stations -- I've only scratched the surface of the offerings, but every station I've looked for has been there so far.
B002KDSBGA|5.0|Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is dead-on perfection. It is hard to envision a better depiction of racial divides, bigotry, innocence, hidden love, and Finch as the ultimate Good. I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and I am always amazed at how fresh it seems each time. &#34;Stand up, young man, your Father is passing by.&#34;

B007REV4YI|4.0|Some people don't like the &#34;new&#34; James Bond - not enough gizmos for them, I personally like the newer Bond movies and Daniel Craig is excellent in the role. Hope to see him in at least one more, but from what I have read this is it for him in this role.
B0044XV5N0|4.0|Vintage Graham Greene, spies, double spies, almost &#34;a looking glass war&#34;. A satirical look at cold war foreign office and secret<br />service antics.  An excellent book to travel with.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun game. Easy enough to be relaxing but not so easy that it's mindless entertainment. I like to play before falling asleep or while watching TV.
B002APU580|5.0|This one with Keira Knightley is my favorite adaptation of the classic novel - LOVE! I have watched this movie ad nauseum & never get tired of it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Awesome game! The graphics are amazing and the story is good too. Even with bad internet the multiplayer is great. It takes a while to download though in the end its worth it.
0440539811|5.0|Though both aimed at making you reconsider your paradigm, The Illuminatus! Trilogy does so with a joyfully bizarre story and, I'm certain, far more clever cultural references than I caught.  Perhaps one of my favorite considerations is the concept of fnords - things that we have a programmed response to and may not even realize it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|What made this book good was the knowledge of this fine AMericans untimely death at the hands of a PTSD veteran that he was trying to help.  We need to stop wars and if we can do it by sniper attack then let's get er dun.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|For being a free book (at least when I found it) you definitely get your money's worth (or time's worth in this case). I thought it was going to be a comedy, but it while it did have funny moments it was more serious and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Having a plan is great, but sometimes Fate can't help but intervene. The chemistry between Megan and Carter... I mean Connor (LOL) is strong, but it's Connor's relentlessness that really heats things up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|totally worth the 7 dollers . if u have money on your kindle get this app. it rocks. you should totally get it
B000FA6720|5.0|I have a special place in my heart for this book and finally bought it for my Kindle.  I love it and recommend it to others.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good thought sequence - well planned.<br />Plausible - you could imagine the story happening in a true life environment (mostly).<br />Well written - flows well.<br />Very violent - probably not for everyones cup of tea
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just fantastic. Great theory and edge of your seat cliff hangers. You root for the heroes and marvel at the insanity of the villains.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Reads like something that was made up as it was being written - very disjointed.<br />Too much repitition on the geographic environment.<br />Does not flow freely.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it is a very good game but some times I find my self low on money but it is still a fun game
B004GHNIRK|5.0|So much is the same today as it was almost two centuries ago. It took a lot of effort to read but it was well worth the expenditure.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|IT WAS A VERY GOOD READ, I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. lOOKING FOWARDED TO MY NEXT BOOK. I HAVE GIVEN MY REVIEW , THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved this movie.  Loved the direction and story, and Ben Affleck should have received an award for his directing.  This movie was exciting and smart and kept me on the edge of my seat for most of it!
1451696191|3.0|Okay, I read this because I was looking for a book for a college class for &#34;reluctant readers&#34;.  It's a &#34;coming of age&#34; tome, and like teenagers, the writer thinks everything he has to say is important.  While not as &#34;raw&#34; as &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34;,I didn't feel as though I learned anything new about teenage angst, and I became bored with the last chapters that just seemed to go on and on without revealing much as to character growth.  What do I know?  Hollywood picked it up for a movie. Maybe that's a clue.  Go watch &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; instead.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Finally something produced that doesn't treat the viewer as if they were a youngster.  Very intelligent, well acted, well directed, and probably the best series I have ever seen on TV.
B000002GBJ|4.0|Great record from a Prog Procer! It would be better if it has a better booklet...<br />Gran CD de un prócer del Progresivo. La presentación es muy básica; la obra merece algo mejor

B0094K35S6|4.0|I watched it when I was younger and wanted to watch it again as an adult. Its a good solid movie and way beyond its time when released.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|I forgot how many great songs they had. My wife and I enjoyed remembering our teens. We love \\"would I lie to you?\\" Sound quality is good but not audiophile level.
B0091WQ58E|5.0|Great show, great show. I can probably say that 10 times. I loved every episode. I wish more were available.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|I bought it twice, once for my Grandaughter and then a copy for me. I rave over this movie to all my friends.
B009B08LJ2|3.0|I watched but but I came back to review it and can't remember anything about this one which means it wasn't that memorable to me.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is a great movie and tells the truth about alcohol and drug abuse. It's worth watching more than once. It was worth the money sound and quality of picture were great I would recommend this movie to everyone. Thank you

B00A1U2SVS|2.0|I'll side with the reviewer known as &#34;Jim&#34; on Amazon.  Zep is THE original band that got me into rock many years ago.  Own all the stuff, consider them to be The Beatles of Hard Rock and think that Page totally destroys Clapton on nearly every level (songwriting, arranging, soloing, tunefulness, and, in the day, CONSISTENCY-- at least on record.)  Beck may be the master of the three, but Page is the COMPOSER.  That said, this performance was not very good, and, it falls largely on Page (who, as you can gather from above, I adore.)<br /><br />Now, Page has always been a bit sketchy live, but it's always been dangerous and soaked in swagger, and yes, some freakin' magick!  This, well, this is Page not knowing his parts, this is Page not playing very much in the last decade, and this is Page, perhaps, being hung up on Jack White, who, in his bands, the thrash and burn approach is ESSENTIAL.  In the day, Zep could always tear you a new one, and Jimmy certainly had some wizardly punky, YES, PUNKY power...  but this is stomping about playing your guitar with hammers as fingers, instead of delivering the MUSIC as a Hammer Of God.<br /><br />I was skeptical about Plant, I mean, in his prime he was unstoppable: range, emotion, musicality, creativity, delivery, VARIETY, X-FACTOR and soul.  He seems a bit tentative but then eases in and surprisingly holds up wonderfully.  He doesn't really approach his vocals like this anymore, perhaps because it's movin' on for him musically and perhaps because, he was 20 years old and was gifted with Gold in the day.  His job was certainly the hardest here, and he performed incredibly well, 60-plus or no.<br /><br />John Paul Jones is a master musician, and always has been and continues to be.  He was born into the game and has never left.  He's the secret weapon of the band and continues to be.  He shows up, has a good time, joins the musical moment and he's set.  He is a consummate musician, and that's what consummate musicians do,he was never in doubt.<br /><br />Jason.  Jason has to be his dad without being his dad.  How hard is your job, because Jason has THE HAMMER of the Gods as his father.  And he does dad proud.  If the guy couldn't play then he shouldn't be up there, and, if Jason can't do the job then don't even do the show.  You don't replace a drummer as monumental as Bonham with just anyone.  Has to be someone in the rock &#34;family,&#34; (I'm talking to you, Zak Starkey, if Moon ever had a son [he does have a non-drummer daughter who he likely barely knew] it would be you, son of Ringo the great.)  Jason does his job, my only criticism being that he may have played it a bit safe, but, with Page flying around with one engine off and the other one burning and everybody keeping an ear out for you to &#34;bring dad's magic,&#34; what might you do?<br /><br />This performance was shoddy, and it falls to Page.  Page was the musical director of yore, what has he done to himself?  If you rate this disc high I do not understand you.  I'll give you that &#34;Side 2&#34; is a bit more listenable, and they come close to some gel here and there, but largely, Page went over like a lead balloon, here.  If you don't know the reference then don't comment.<br /><br />P.S.  Am disagreeing with you, Jim (the reviewer), on Dazed And Confused.  OTHER THAN THIS RECORDING, love the track, love the improv. feature, love the bow.  It's a cathartic mess, a mindf___, a wet dream, a fever dream, a deliverance, a transference-- when they do it right.  The bow was a great feature and, was once, even a cool approach AND at one time was spellcastingly beautiful (even on TSRTS.)  Page the wizard could do gonzo gorgeous things.  Anyway, agree to disagree on Dazed?<br /><br />I would like to add [in lame, unfair, possibly immature mudslinging school rival for sh_ts and giggles kind of way] that The Who shows of the last decade have been better (although Daltrey is clearly a struggle, and in a bad way unlike his &#34;struggle&#34; when it was his only approach back in the day.  That said, it's a hard job singing like Roger Daltrey any day, by gawd being when you're 60 plus!)  And Townshend is actually exciting, sketchy as usual, but in an actual NEW way, on the guitar.  I found him often inspiring and still &#34;searching&#34; with his instrument after all these years. (And in EXCELLENT voice!)  I would also add that The Cream reunion was also far better, and Clapton kills Page here [so sad, for me], with Jack Bruce's vocals, again, being the only real rub, and again, being the hardest job.  No one should be able to sing beautiful, 20 year old rock music in their 60s.  McCartney is actually in pretty fine voice, although he sings as much as he &#34;shouts&#34; and even his &#34;shout&#34; is still in pretty fine form.  But, no one f__ks like they did in their 60s the way they did in their 20s, either, and rock music is a huge helping of sexual power as well as soul, rebellion, joy and danger.  The singer is always going to have the hardest job, their THROATS hold pitches-- no frets, no keys.  When wind and throat is your instrument, and rock is your bag, it's a feat, and when sex is a key ingredient in the music, well...  I'm sure they're all still studly but, c'mon...
B0000261RJ|5.0|There was a slight fall off here compared to Holy Diver and The Last in Line. It is very apparent that Dio had lost some of the rawness that made the band great and was going a more commercial route. That said, still full of amazing songs including the titles cut, Another Lie, Rock N Roll Children, Hungry For Heaven, and more! This sounds really fantastic on vinyl where you can appreaciate the deep bass and full analouge sound. This was the last great line up and after that the band seemed like it would change from album to album. One of my biggest regrets was not going to see this concert when I had the chance. I did catch Dio on the Dream Evil tour in 1987 which blew me away. Other classic shows: live at the House of Blues in New Orleans (2001 or 2002?) and opening up for Iron Maiden with Motörhead in Woodlands, Texas (this is my all time greatest metal show ever attended!)

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have been a fan of Harry Potter since just before the first film came out. I mom and I went and saw EVERY movie together and we read all the books. I'm so sad it's over but at least I can watch it over and over again. The only issue is that I can't play it on an American DVD player.
0062515675|5.0|Took a long time side-stepping this book and wished I'd read it earlier. Great fable on life and looking after yourself and your destiny.<br /><br />Paid it forward already and will pay it forward more in the future!

B00797MB0O|2.0|It was intended to be, and was, a meaningless waste of one's life. I felt bad when it was over. I know that was the point of pointlessness, arrogance and worthless, selfish, immoral living. So maybe it did teach values.

B005USZML4|5.0|I have already reviewed the book,The Accused, I love this series well enough to review this one also.  Grisham is back better than ever, after having had a slump, in my never-sufficiently humble opinion!  (An example of a book from the slump period is Playing for Pizza.)  I am amazed that Grisham can bend his huge talent to write good young adult fiction.  And I do mean GOOD!  As a child, I read the Nancy Drew mysteries.  In my aready described opinion, these are so much  better!  I'll buy and read every one of these he cares to write.  It's like eating a cookie to read one of these.  I read many varied types of books and love many genres, but these are such a delightful break from some of the others!  Thanks for making them available!
B00A757EFW|4.0|this is ok i have fun chasing these little creatures around why do we have to put so many words down to submit our response
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I adore Grisham, even though I personally think he is just about 3 years out of a slump period in his writing.  BUT, having said that, he seems to have come back better than ever.  I am so pleased that he has turned his hand to some young adult fiction.  And he has done it with grace and charm.  The stories are so compelling (page turners) and so wholesome and show such family values, while admitting that there is an opposite force at work in life.  I also read 2 other books in this series, and I feel like this kid lives around the  block from me, and I want him to stop in for milk and cookies and a long chat!  Thanks for making this available!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|well who does notove angry birds, they can really keep you angry when you cannot get past a level, but I have so much fun with these birds, love the  sounds thanks
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I have heard of the Slenderman legend, and have heard some hype over the Slenderman games.  So when I saw the first chapter was free, I was really excited.  I love being creeped out, so anything that could possibly scare me, I'm willing to try.  I even waited until it was dark out and the kids were in bed to play.<br />  I picked 'The Road' first, and opted for 'easy' and 'night mode'.  The game begins on on a deserted road, next to a broken-down car.  The ominous sounds of footsteps, owls, and thriller-type music play slightly in the background as you make your way down the twisting road.  The first note pops up right away on a lamp post. I assumed that I needed to click on the note to collect it, but it didn't work.  I had to close off the game and Google the instructions to find out that I needed to walk right into the notes.<br />  So game back on, second attempt, same settings. I once again see the note right away, but I had to play with the navigation a little to figure out how to turn.  I finally collected the first note, and continued down the road.  It becomes apparent pretty quickly that you need to venture beyond the road (otherwise you just hit a road block).  So into the woods I went.  There's buildings and campfires, along with some other structures that need to be explored to find the notes.<br />  Finally, there's Slenderman.  You'll see small flashes of him as you go, which will cause your screen to flicker and fuzz.  But simply turning around is enough to get away from him.  If you do get caught by Slenderman, the screen will turn to complete static and black out, the words \\" Game Over\\" popping up on the screen.  Not exactly the thrill I was expecting.<br />  I don't know what happens if you collect all 8 notes -I got bored after collecting 5, and decided that virtual suicide was better than continuing to wander through the game.  So I ran into the arms of Slenderman and ended it.<br />  FINAL THOUGHTS: 'Slenderman Chapter 1' was repetitious and tedious.  Even the sound effects play on a continuous loop.  There was nothing thrilling or even remotely scary about it.  I'll admit, I did jump a bit when going into the phone booth, but only because it was unexpected.  I even tried 'The Farm', hoping it would be more interesting, but it was the same thing, just different structures.<br />  Slenderman wasn't for me.  As a free app, it wouldn't hurt to try it out for yourself.  But I wouldn't recommend paying any money for it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|For the engineer or sci-fi minded, this is an absolute MUST read.  Even if not, still HIGHLY recommended.  This is very Apollo 13 style but with lots of comic relief.  The technical aspects of this story are extremely well thought out and had me dying to know the next problem would be solved.
B000002J1U|5.0|Okay so when I first heard this album, I didnt really think it was all that special.  I mean of course I knew the Immigrant song and everything but other than that it never really sunk into me off the get go how amazing this album is.  Tracks like, the Immigrant Song, Friends, Celebration Day, Thats the Way, Tangerine, and Bron Y aur Stomp are just some of the best songs to ever be put on a record (in my opinion of course).  This album at the time of its release was considered by many Zeppelin fans as disappointing, it just wasnt what fans expected, which we now know is one of the reasons why Zeppelin was and forever always will be one of the greatest rock n roll bands of all time.  But at the time, they gave their fans a semi acoustic album after the mammoth rock album that was Zeppelin II and fans felt a little alienated.  I consider this album to be my favorite Led Zeppelin album just because A. The songwriting is amazing and B. Tell me that Bron Y aur Stop doesnt have one of the catchiest riffs out of Zeppelins whole catalog.  All in all great album, the only down side I would say would be \\"Since I have Been Loving You\\" which most fans love, however it is personally my least favorite Zeppelin song and Hats off to Roy Harper.  Great job Led Zeppelin, we are still loving this album 43 years later!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really like this one, it was different than a lot of other romance novels where the drama comes from the guy being so mysterious. The author created interesting character that the reader could become invested in. Good Stuff.
B000002JSJ|2.0|The only two good songs on this whole album are first 2 tracks.  I am a huge Zeppelin fan so this is really hard to write but this album is absolutely a terrible effort for Led Zeppelin maybe even the worst album in their catalog and that's saying alot because their last album wasn't very good either.  There is a good reason why its not a very good album, there was a lot of stuff going on in the band when it was made.  Jimmy Page had a really bad drug problem, a nasty habit with Heroin and you really can tell, and the majority of the recording Robert Plant was in a wheel chair doing the vocals because of a bad car accident he had been in earlier in the year.  The whole album was done in just 18 days, including all the mixing done by Jimmy Page who was having a huge problem with sleeping during the recording.  He has said previously he would sometimes stay awake for 18 to 20 hours during the recording.  The problem with this album is that it was just rushed, they didn't take the time they needed to to make sure they came out with a good album.  The first two tracks are great, but the rest of the album just feels like filler after filler.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am crazy about this game, I absolutely love it. I love the big grid ones the best, they can really make you think.
B004RQVVGU|3.0|Lets start with the highlight tracks, and this is easy because there are only 3.  Over the Mountain-great album opener, next would be Flying High Again, followed by Diary of a Madman.  Lets make this clear, I am a huge Ozzy Osbourne fan and I have every single solo album that he has ever recorded.  But this album is just not as good as Blizzard or Bark at the Moon, or really any of his other albums really.  Blizzard only originally had 9 songs on it, 5 of those songs are consistently played on the radio, why?  Because it was an amazing album!  I dont know what was missed here, I mean it was recorded by all the same people from the first album so why was the songwriting just not as strong?  I see many people complaining on here about the 2002 Re Recording, and not even really discussing the album, thats really frustrating.  But I guess I will touch on that too, I understand where you guys are coming from and they probably should have never done it but guess what?  Remixes come out everyday, it really isnt that big of a deal and plus they just came out with this new 2012 remaster which is the original tracks.  The downfall of that release, there is absolutely nothing new and unheard on it!  Anyone notice the second disc basically is Tribute with like 3 or 4 tracks removed!  Come on Ozzy you call that bonus material?!?! What a ripoff!
B001CDLATE|5.0|My new TV has a 2D-3D conversion. Of the blu-ray disks that I've tried, none work so well as Baraka. It's even more stunning in 3D and converts so well that you won't need to purchase a 3D version if it ever comes out. Go to your electronics store and have them prove it to you. You'll go home with a new TV that has 2D-3D conversion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the story line.  Did not see the movie and decided to read the book.  Nicholas Sparks keeps you in suspense - has romance, jealously, real life scenerio of spousal abuse.
B00887490Y|1.0|After seeing that the mind behind Martyrs was behind The Tall Man, I didn't know what to expect. Martyrs was so gory and extremely hard to watch, yet I will admit that it presented an idea so fresh and new that it shocked millions of people. The Tall Man, however, achieved nothing but the attempt at TRYING way too hard.  Trying to be a thriller; trying to be a social dissection; trying to be much too intelligent for it's own good; trying to be a twist on the typical whodunnit mystery; trying to make the audience \\"think\\" by giving actors these (cheesy) theatrical solo moments on camera about \\"saving the children\\". The only result of all this TRYING was failure at keeping my attention. *SEMI-SPOILER* The ending basically leads you to believe that a poor town should not be allowed to have children. Apparently, according to The Tall Man, only people with lots of money who live in busy cities should be given the privilege of having children. Doesn't matter if you molest your own children or love & try to protect your children with all of your heart: if you are poor, The Tall Man will take your children away from you. I found this to be a ridiculous, not shocking, ending for a very dull movie.

B00BETX5PS|4.0|Who'd have thought that a Bond movie would address the existential issues of the Baby Boomers who are finding themselves with mundane versions of Bond's struggle with his maturing body, loss, and issues of generative identity?<br /><br />This movie was well done on all its levels.<br /><br />Even the sexually ambiguous villain and attempt to provoke Bond's homophobia (non-existent) were well handled, for a change.
B005K17RU0|5.0|There is a pay version of this app but the only difference is that the free version has ads that are barely noticeable at the top of the page. The most important thing is that the weather reports are usually very accurate. You can set a home location so whenever you open the app the weather report for your town is the first thing you see. You can save as many locations as you want. You can see current Doppler radar for your area and get a weekly weather report as well. The app has links to other resources like the weather channel. The app also posts severe weather and wind advisories.

B0052REUW0|5.0|This book is an essential primer on the role of violence in society. It does two things supremely well - uses data to prove that we live in a far less violent age today than in the past (in spite of local news coverage); and identifies the major drivers of the decline in a way that should inform policy.<br /><br />A must read

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game and one that makes you work. Not easy like lots of games involving hidden objects.  Has a story line which makes it fun.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|With actors of the caliber of Geoffry Rush, Colin Firth and Helen B. Carter I expected this movie to be well-played, and it is.  What I did not expect was how empathetic I felt toward the King's situation and restrictive life circumstances.  I am not generally a fan of the British Royalty; I do not go 'ga ga' over all things British.  I am, however, a fan of a well-told story, a unique perspective and I'm a sucker for a 'period piece'.  You will find all this, plus gorgeous sets and clothing, and some simply amazing hats!  Watch this movie to take you back in time to a place you rarely get a chance to go, based in reality, of all things.
B00AFOS8A0|3.0|The golden era of the classical music industry is long gone. It's bad for the established companies, like Decca or DG, that they cannot expect to practice premium pricing for their records. It's also bad for the customers, as the quality slip continues. The producers of the classical music recordings are no longer musicians or music lovers. They are more and more becoming the businessmen who can do the fire-sale to cash in before the supposed final collapse (of continuous decline) of the classical music recording industry.<br /><br />This (would-be) important collection of Verdi's (almost) complete works contains many excellent recordings. In fact, it overlaps with many from my pre-existing collection. Unfortunately it contains NO LIBRETTI. Not as booklets. Not in a CD-ROM. Not even as a download from Decca/Universal's website (as in the case of DG/Universal's [[ASIN:B00980IA3M Wagner box]].) Only synopsis of each opera is given. Neither original Italian/French texts nor translations are included. (For LIBRETTI OPTIONS, see notes below.) This is an insult to Verdi's glorious music and all artists involved in these recordings. Of course, this is not Universal's first crime of omission, nor will it be its last. However, one's expectation is reasonably higher in a *landmark* release like this. -- The producers of this box either never listen to operas with libretti or they would be among the first to have them all memorized. How else could one explain such a glaring omission!<br /><br />At this moment I can only hope for one of the remedies to happen:<br /><br />(i) a PDF download of libretti and translations at Universal's website, complimentary or at a price, or<br />(ii) a release of a different \\"premium edition\\" with libretti and translations.<br /><br />This would create a win-win situation. For those who'd rather not have the libretti, they can still have the set at a rock-bottom price. For those who can afford it, the choice of having tailor-made (with track numbers) libretti and translations would be there. Talking about business, this would have been the right business decision: keeping your customers happy while making a bit more cash. -- I obviously can not speak for all, but personally I am happy to pay extra 50% or more to have the convenience of accessing libretti and translations tailor-made for the set.<br /><br />It would be nice if any of the Decca's producers involved in this production can inform us the reasons behind this terrible decision, but I guess they are probably too busy planning the next fire-sale to hear \\"the little people\\". Decline of classical music industry? Talking about self-fulfilling prophecy!<br /><br />-----------------<br />N.B. 1. For those who can read Italian, the Italian libretti are available online at \\"giuseppeverdi.it\\".<br /><br />2. For those who are willing to shell out $300+, they have the option of having all libretti of Verdi's *Italian* operas with English translation in 4 books by Nico and Carol Castel: [[ASIN:1878617109 The Complete Verdi Libretti Vol. 1]], [[ASIN:1878617117 The Complete Verdi Libretti Vol. 2]], [[ASIN:1878617125 The Complete Verdi Libretti Vol. 3]], [[ASIN:1878617133 The Complete Verdi Libretti Vol. 4]]. They can be ordered directly from the publisher, Leyerle Publications. (Google Leyerle Publications.) Since Amazon doesn't have any info, I will list it below. Note that there are no French versions of Verdi operas, like Don Carlos or Jérusalem.<br /><br />Volume One. 438 pages, contains Aids, Alzira, Aroldo, Atilla, Un Ballo in Maschera, La Battaglia di Legnano and Il Corsaro.<br />Volume Two. 618 pages, contains Don Carlo, I Due Foscari, Ernani, Falstaff, La Forza del Destino, Giovanna d'Arco and Un Giorno di Regno.<br />Volume Three. 484 pages, contains I Lombardi, Luisa Miller, Macbeth, I Masnadieri, Nabucco, Oberto Conte di San Bonifaccio and Otello.<br />Volume Four. 523 pages, contains Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra, Stiffelio, La Traviata, Il Trovatore and I Vespri Siciliani.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'd say this is movie potential, but found the story took a long time to tell, perhaps more detail than necessary, but what kept the whole thing alive was the self-deprecating character humour and the by-play with words between the characters, particularly the central two husband and wife. Very entertaining.
0679746048|4.0|Very interesting learning more about Borderline Personality Disorder from someone who actually lives with this personality disorder. Also very interesting to learn about the hospital and how it worked and how the nurses were especially back in that time. It's definitely a book worth reading.<br />Nothing like the movie though-Which was why I decided to read the book. Still good though.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Not his best effort - and trying to keep an aing character alive (vicariously though his son) must be difficult. as spy/action stories go, not bad.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read many of Ken Follett's books, but the four books that I have treasured more than all the others are &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;, and its sequel, &#34;World Without End&#34;; book one of the Century Trilogy, &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; and, this, the second book, &#34;Winter of the World&#34;.  This book chronicles the lives of the characters we met in the first book, along with their children, from the rise of Hitler in Germany through to World War II.<br /><br />Follet's description of the events make you feel as though you are present as they happen and the superb drawing of the characters leave you feeling you know them.  It would be most difficult to top &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and it is hard for the reader not to make a comparison, but it must be avoided.  The book, on its own merits, rates in my view five stars.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Not in the vein of Connelly's usual quality - a little slow to start, but goofd finish. Perhaps a little out there plot-wise.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this it is a great game for a horse lover and it works almost perfectly even with no wifi
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I am not so patiently waiting for season 5 to become available on Prime!  I check every week- love this show!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Great show and I love the included guide to Westeros on the discs. It breaks down the key historical points that viewers might otherwise be lost on if they did not read the book.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|Dr. Krugman's nuanced and informative arguments dispel the conventional wisdom that classifies him  as a left-wing economist.  While Krugman is decidedly Keynesian,  conservatives can still appreciate this book's arguments about pragmatic actions that must be taken  at certain points in the business cycle.  Liberals will be delighted by the author's bold approach, and his conviction that the durability of the dollar allows for  bold economic stimulus.  Krugman points out that neither Republicans nor President Obama have fully heeded his advice during the current crisis, but he offers--at the very least--excellent food for thought for future economists and policymakers.
B0044FEZBM|5.0|I saw this ballet for the first time at our local \\"Opera Club\\". I found the production to be delightful and the dancing is tops.  I am so glad that more and more Bolshoi Ballet performances are starting to be distributed and shown at small town venues.  The series \\"Ballet in Cinema\\" from Emerging Pictures is facilitating this process; I wish their productions were made available for purchase shortly after they have had their theaters run.

B00B2270P8|5.0|Wasn't sure how you could improve on this movie, but the additional footage was really a nice compliment to the series.  Well done!
B000JLQS7E|5.0|Great production.  Luciano is to fat for a Radames; but then, he starts singing and we stop looking at his figure and listening at that unique voice!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just got this game and it has captured my interest. I think my kids will really like playing the game.
B0013V33DG|5.0|Dessay steals the show.  She is perfect for the part!  This is a very funny opera and the acting is superb.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie!  It's really good.  Price was under three bucks and the dvd is new in package.  Shipped it out quickly.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|Well staged performance.  Netrebko does an outstanding job both at acting (specially during the crazy scene) and her singing throughout the whole opera.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|...it would sound like this.  Seriously, give them a try.  Crazy percussion syncopation, unique voice, incredible guitar and synthesizer...crank it up.  They are a truly break-out band.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|Great production.  Strong performances by the entire cast.  Netrebko weight gain is a little distracting; but her singing is, as always, great.
B00902MCVY|5.0|That is wonderful music, and I hope the next time ...<br />Espero que el time II sea igual de bueno.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Did not work; tried to install three different times including with HP support. None of their suggestions helped.<br />  Did not work
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I had a great time watching this. Jessica Lange is awesome. The rest of the cast was just as entertaining.
B00ANVX6DY|2.0|MY DAUGHTER LOVES SOFIA THE PRINCESS AND HER AND i HAVE SEEN ALL OF THEM NUMEROUS TIMES.  I SAW THIS DVD ADVERTISED ON TV AND WANTED TO ORDER RIGHT AWAY, WHICH I DID ON AMAZON.  I ALSO MADE SURE IT WAS TO COME WITH THE STICKERS, TIARA AND ACTIVITY KIT AS DESCRIBED ON TV.  THESE FUN EXTRAS WERE TO BE INCLUDED AND WERE NO. I HAVE TO SAY I WAS KIND OF TAKEN BACK, I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY ANY ORDERS FROM AMAZON.  I WOULD HAVE SENT THIS SELECTION BACK IF MY DAUGHTER DID NOT WATCH ME TAKE IT OUT OF THE BOX.  I PURCHASED THIS WITH THE ASSUMPTION I WAS GETTING THE KIT AS WELL.  FIRST PURCHASE FROM AMAZON I AM SADDENED BY.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game .easy interface<br />No buggy issues . The game moves at a steady pace again easy interface with  the build and action keys not bad for a free app
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was late coming to Downton Abbey fandome, but I'm glad I caught on.  This is a refreshingly intelligent series!  I have seen this kind of talent from a cast in years.  The scenery and writing is superb.  The first episode of season 3 didn't disappoint.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I read the reviews and knew this game would take a long time to donnload on my Kindle Fire.  I don't mind that for a good game.  However,  after hours of waiting and having it finally make it all the way to the end it just looped around and started the download all over again!  I tried a few times with the same results and finally contacted Alawar for support. I was told &quot;sorry we don 't know what the problem is.  Contact Amazon and get a refund.&quot;  Really!!??  They didn't even bother trying.  Guess they really could just care less. Very disappointed I didn't get to play.  More disappointed in their lame support.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am a Play-by-play announcer and find that the access to weather enhances my calls. I am able to be more descriptive, and the features has not let me dwon. It is accurate and easy to use, adding just that extra bit when needed.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book. The end was great, not necessarily fairy tale but nice and neat. The author stayed true to the character as she ended the book. It made me want to run out and learn all about flowers!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great application, the key pads are easy to use, and the size makes it really easy to read. This has been a great addition to my applications, and is used very often. This would be great for anyone that needs access to a calculator at anytime, and the size is both fun and eminently usable.
B000001GQY|5.0|Emil Gilels is a fantastic piano player and he does well with this album of all of Brahms, piano Concertos on one disc.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The application is fine, and you can get into the gaming,_sort of_ but it is not the same as you get on your home computer or laptop. You can however still stay up with your friends, but the gaming is more limited.
B000026OHN|5.0|This piece of Bach's was admirably performed by that great pianist, Sviatoslav Richter.  When one is feeling low, there is nothing more soothing than this masterly composed piece for the pieano
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a fun game but the ads drive you crazy. For the price it would be better to get the paid version. Still overall if you do not mind advertizing, this is fun and mind boggling. :)
B00942X8PY|5.0|A truly great app. I had to force myself to stop after level 1-34 to write this review, or I'd play all night. Even the level names are funny. I appreciate that attention to detail.<br />The first couple dozen levels are good tutorials, mostly solvable in under a minute.<br />From there it really gets fun. Adding and subtracting, one-way arrows and splits.<br />I love it. :-)
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Not really anything bad to say...a bit gory at times, but due to the context of the movie, it's expeted
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is like having a real horse. It prepares you for when you want a real horse. I love it.

B000I9U9A4|4.0|A good guy flick, teaching about the importance of encouragement, perserverence, and sacrifice in the face of life and death issues.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|While I enjoyed this very much, I really prefer his older cds.  It made for a nice change though. Recommend.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz Scaggs' latest project, Memphis reveals an individualized homage to the personality and roots of R&B and blues music, which is so harmonious to Memphis, Tennessee.<br /><br />Recorded at the legendary Willie Mitchell's Royal Studios, located in Memphis and established in 1956 as the operating studio of Hi Records, Scaggs' Memphis captures the inimitable feeling and foundation of the Memphis sound.  The carefully crafted song selections on this project fully avails itself to that well known vibe, history and character, and proves that the Memphis sound is just as exciting today as it was back then.<br /><br />The producer, Steve Jordan, and recording engineers Niko Bolas with Boo Lawrence Mitchell, help belay this project by knowing the strengths and craftsmanship of that sound, as well as the countless talent and abilities of the musicians.  In this project, I sense that Jordan appreciates the blues as a spiritual feeling and therefore encourages the musicians to stretch out and give into the intensity and feeling of the given mood.  I also feel it's that special approach that masters the accuracy and authenticity in Memphis, while taking on a natural outflow and without being over done.<br /><br />Song selections on Memphis feature a diverse repertoire from blues, R&B, and folk genres.  \\"Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl\\" is upbeat with an energetic rhythm that favorably contrasts with the mysterious and dark spirit of the lyrics.  Similarly, this energy is intensified in \\"Cadillac Walk\\", which will either make you pound your hands on the steering wheel along with the hammering percussion rhythms and Scaggs' powerful vocals, or it will have you dancing and playing air guitar (or an up-right bass) along with the bouncing rockabilly vibe.  In \\"So Good to Be Here\\" Scaggs beautifully acknowledges Al Green's identifiable and influential feel, and he also incorporates the distinctive Memphis R&B horn sound, also legendary with Green's style, through The Royal Horns.<br /><br />The R&B flavor of Memphis progresses with sweet and saucy vocals on \\"Love on a Two Way Street\\" paired with Charles Hodges silky finesse on the organ and Jim Cox on the piano.  The Royal Strings, and the piano and organ arrangements on this project are expressive and unique, and also stand out in \\"Pearl of the Quarter\\".  \\"You've Got Me Cryin'\\" features Scaggs' on guitar, and his complimentary bluesy voice, in a swirling tempo with Rick Vito also on guitar<br /><br />The bluesy mood segues into a warm and cozy gem, \\"Rainy Night in Georgia\\", wherein Scaggs' soft and low voice wraps around the familiar lyrics, giving his version of the song a distinguishing and seductive depth. This breathtaking style carries over in the lush vocals on \\"Can I Change My Mind\\", which intermingles with the sultry spoken background voice of Monet Owens, and Scaggs' tenderness in \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" rocks the listener gently in this beloved song.<br /><br />I found \\"Dry Spell\\" to be the heart beat of this project, with a pulse of unsurpassable intensity as Scaggs sensationally nails the vocals in his natural and comfortable blues element, which delivers equally with Charlie Musselwhite on harmonica and Keb' Mo on slide dobro.<br /><br />Scaggs' talent as a vocalist resonates further, felt in a certain and yet sorrowful mood that's elemental to the blues, in his original tracks \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" and  \\"Sunny Gone\\", whereby he elegantly whispers raw sentiment into the lyrics \\"Snow bound by a lovely face, the quiet grace soothed me.\\"<br /><br />Simply put, from the ideal song selections, to the faultless musicianship, and even the sophisticated cover art, everything just falls together and fits the bill in \\"Memphis\\".  After listening to this CD many times, not only does it get better and better, but I walk away with the impression that this music fits Scaggs like a tailored suit. His distinctive style, his insatiable energy, his skillful ability to learn and grow with new ideas of using his voice, and his passion for quality and perfectionism, means there's no denying that Boz Scaggs is a serious, respectable and highly professional musician who is fully engaged in his music.<br /><br />Memphis just reinforces Boz Scaggs' musical mastery and reiterates his individual gift of flair; it's definitely one of his most intuitive projects, and it's unmistakably him.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|A great intro to what the food and particularly meat industry is doing.  This coupled with the book &#34;In Defense of Food&#34; by Michael Pollan has prompted me to change our family diet.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I read this book as I want to see the movie (haven't as yet) but wanted to read the book first.  I enjoyed reading it but was a bit disappointed with the ending.  I was expecting some fantatic insight but didn't get it, but that is probably just me ....

B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME! I still can't find Herobrine though but I am still trying as hard as I can
B000UJ48WC|5.0|SK is one of my favorite directors, and Jack one of my favorite actors, and The Shining is the best King book of them all, I think, so this film is just pure classic all around. I saw it the week it came out (it was a lot of fun in the theater, scared people silly at points), and unlike many films of that era it holds up perfectly today. I always wanted to see its many superbly composed shots in high def at home, and now I do, thanks to a near-perfect transfer to blu-ray.<br /><br />The colors are crisp, with Kubrick's unique printing techniques making the snow look as good as snow ever has in a film...even though it was all salt and styrofoam. The sound is very clear and clean, and the only complaint I have is one that I'm seeing more and more of on BD reissues: they didn't letterbox it. I have an old lb dvd, and this full screen version does indeed crop some off the top and sides, which to my mind isz unforgivable for a director like Kubrick, who composed every square inch of his images like the master he was. As one of the bonus features here points out, he was a photographer before director, and that sense of composition is why his films look so damn good in every frame. So to cut even a bit off those frames is a crime, and it's done here.<br /><br />Why are studios doing this? Just to sell us a letterbox blu-ray soon? Probably, as no other reason makes sense. Sad, but that's studio greed as always. However, they get a mild pass for not having any trailers on this, just the film, and five very nice extras that were on the last dvd version. There's a doc on the film, one of SK himself, ande best of all is his daughter Vivian's home movie of the making of the film, including a few priceless bits of SK telling Jack how to play a scene, and some other sweet bits of Jack horsing around backstage. Plus there are commentaries, one by Viv on ehr film, and one on The Shining by the cinematographer and SK's biographer. Both are worth your time.<br /><br />Not much to add about the movie, other than to say it's one of the finest low-key suspense/thriller/mild horror flicks of them all. It's a real treat to see it in almost-theater quality, even with the edges trimmed.<br /><br />And for serious Kubrick fans who hated seeing the skeleton scene at the end trimmed off other editions, it is in this one, so rejoice in completeness. With a director as sublime as Kubrick, everything should be precisely as he wanted it. (So why not letterbox his films just enough to see 100% of his intended image, not 94%...)about the movie, other than to say it's one of the finest low-key suspense/thriller/mild horror flicks of them all.

B000SEGUDE|1.0|Could not understand where this book was going.  Difficult &#34;old world&#34; language.  Put it down after one chapter after realizing that each chapter was a separate story set in different places with different characters.

B000OVLINI|5.0|This book is so beautifully written that you are simply carried away.  I reread phrases and pages just because the language was so rich and poetic.  It is amazing that this is a translation!  After reading this book, I immediately read Carlos Ruiz Zafron's other two books and cannot wait for his third book.  He is a brilliant writer and a poet.  Enjoy.

B0089LOKHG|2.0|[...]<br /><br />Maybe there's something about dystopian trilogies that decrees that the last book just won't live up to the first two. After seeing Ally Condie's originally awesome \\"Matched\\" series flounder in its final book, \\"Reached\\" (see earlier review), I reluctantly dismissed it as a fluke. I was really excited to see that \\"Requiem\\", the final installment of the \\"Delirium Trilogy\\" by Lauren Oliver, was being released a few days ago--like, holy-moly-can't-believe-it's-nearly-here-squeal-and-jump excited. The cliffhanger in the second book \\"Pandemonium\\" just had my heart pumping and jaw dropping, and I couldn't wait to see how things turned out. And they turned out... pretty disappointing. WHYYY??<br /><br />After rescuing Julian from a death sentence, Lena and her friends--and Alex--are trying to survive in the Wilds. But the Wilds are no longer a safe haven--the rise of rebellions have made it impossible for the government to deny the existence of the Invalids, and Regulators now infiltrate the borderlands to stamp out the rebels. As Lena navigates the increasingly dangerous terrain, her best friend, Hana, lives a safe, loveless life back in Portland as the new fiancee of the young mayor. But when dark secrets hidden behind painted faces and forced smiles begin to emerge, the girls know they have to do something before the government destroys love forever.<br /><br />Every cloud has a silver lining, so I'll start off with the silvery good stuff first. \\"Requiem\\" is told from two different points of view: Lena's and Hana's. I quite liked the alternating chapters because you could really see the contrast in the former best friends' experiences and thoughts, and how the government and the rebellion were affecting the Invalids and the Cureds. It also created a little bit of tension, especially at the points when they both think or see or experience the same thing and you just see that little crafty connection they have between them.<br /><br />And then there's the cloud. There really wasn't anything monumental happening in the book at all. Lena and her friends in the woods literally just walked through some trees, blew up some stuff... and that's it. Even Hana, who's stuck in the relatively safer, sheltered town, had a more exciting story with Fred the jerk and sneaking around and whatnot. There's just so much that could've happened in the Wilds--it's called the Wilds for heaven's sake!--but there wasn't anything that actually happened. At all. It felt like Ms. Oliver was just trying to wrap up things nice and tidy before the trilogy ended, but while it was nice to see some loose ends tied up, I didn't feel like there was much point to the storyline.<br /><br />The characters themselves fell short of their potential, too. \\"Pandemonium\\" ended with a whopping cliffhanger (ALEEX!!!) and there was so much to work with there, but instead the whole love triangle between Lena, Alex and Julian (and Coral, I guess, so it's more of a square) fell flat. There was a fist fight here, jealous glares there, and that was it. Even in the end, with the final scene between Alex and Lena, I was just left flipping back and going, \\"That's it??\\" It was just so matter-of-fact and blunt and not exciting at all, which was how I felt about the plot as well.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Requiem\\" was a disappointing ending to what could have been a great, unique trilogy about a dystopian society where love is considered a disease. I actually loved that concept, but in the end, it was just about trudging through woods to blow some stuff up...and done. It's just such a bummer because there's some great potential for some action-packed, fast-paced rebellion and emotion. I'd probably recommend reading the first two books in the \\"Delirium\\" trilogy, but I'm just not very sure with the last.<br /><br />Rating: 2/5ing monumental happening in the book at all.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|tegan & sara's sound from album to album has been ever changing and heartthrob is no exception. i've read how some of their fans hate the new album and its not them and so on and so forth...guess they don't really listen to their albums, their sound has always changed and their new sound is not as bad as one might think, i listened to the album all the way through, a lot of good tracks, their writing hasn't changed nor has their beautiful vocals which fit perfectly with the their new sound. worth buying in my opinion
B008YKGQR4|3.0|At first I thought it was great because it gave you an option for the android version or computer. I found the android was better for the kindle so what's the point? then when i commented on something and went back to the news feed, it brought me back to the very beginning which sucks cuz I have a lot of friends and don't always have time to check so I found that very annoying. Then tagging people was annoying as well. I switched back to the other one, over all the other app is less annoying.
B001AII4RM|5.0|for the price, this is a great guy, the pq is top notch, colors pop, picture is fluid and sharp. the movie was is awesome, team that with the price and the sound and picture quality, it is worth an upgrade from dvd and definitely worth getting if you have never owned the movie
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|PART 2 of this series started out slowly, and ended good. This book was the exact opposite to me.The first book in the series was by far the best...the following 2 seeming like an afterthought not well thought through.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So addicting but soooo fun!!!!!!!!! I love the graphics and I have all of the people!!!!! I cant stop playing it!!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game on my Kindle Fire. I hope Big Fish will increase the amount of games that can be layed on the Kindle.
B000TETESQ|4.0|when i first heard the disaster songs, it complety blew me away. If tull would have combined the animal theme, with<br />bungle in the jungle, would have been fabulous. The musical themes of passion play would have been more clear<br />and concise. Sometimes with a long-song album, one can jump-the-shark
0762434260|1.0|This product broke instantaneously in several pieces. This was very disappointing. This was not even worth the return effort at all.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|The Master displays Anderson's film by film maturation into a confident, unique, but still idiosyncratic auteur.  Consider how far he has come since Boogie Nights, which was essentially a paint-by-numbers Scorsese rip, honing his intensity and winnowing down his abundance of ideas into the taut understated (minus Day-Lewis bowling parlor fireworks) storytelling of his last two films.  Echoes of Wier, Kubrick, and Polanski resound his work but among a strong tenor that is equivocally Anderson's own.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The story of Slender Man is that he kidnaps children and kills them. It's your job in this game to collect pieces of paper with clues on them. As you collect them this mysterious man is chasing you. The more pieces you collect the faster the mystery man comes towards you. You can't let him catch you. He has a tendency to teleport or warp (which ever you prefer) towards you. As he gets closer your screen starts to get static all over it. If the whole screen gets filled of static it's game over.<br /><br />Tips:<br />-Never look back.<br />-If you have to go inside a building to get a piece of paper get out fast.<br />-Never stop moving.<br />-Don't trip (jk lol you can't trip)<br /><br />My Experience:<br />I didn't know what i was doing at first cuz there is no instructions. I didn't know anythinng about Slender Man so I didn't know to stay away from him till I saw my screen start going crazy. I got caught at a payphone. I tried again on the Farm and I manage to get 7/8 pieces of paper before I had to pause the game cuz I had to put my nephew to sleep. When I came back It had completely frozen my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I was forced to turn it off. This game is deffinately fun. While I was playing it I was talking to my girl on the phone and I had her playing it too. She got 7/8 before getting caught inside a building and screeming from how scared she was lol. I didn't find it all that scary. I found it more of a suspence rather then scary.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's a great game that anyone can enjoy. This game does deserve to get 5 stars for being a classic horror but the frozen Fire HD say it only deserves a 4/5. Hope this helps. Possitive votes help me out a lot. Thanks.
B007REV4YI|4.0|TV and reporters all acted like this is the BEST Bond film of ALL TIME!!!!!<br />It was good but not the best. The movie starts out great with that train scene but then slows down and gets kind of dull at one point. Many Bond films were just as good as this one if not better, Casino Royale,  The Spy who loved me, Moonraker, Die another day, ect.
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|I thought there might be more to it, but I lost interest after a few levels because it was pretty simple. Great graphics though!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Much of this Jimi material has been out already and with later mixes. This CD isnt bad, but some of the songs are just getting going good and they fade out! Examples are Bleeding Heart and the last track \\"Villanova Junction Blues\\".<br />  \\"Gypsy Boy\\" is a gem, an early run through of the later \\"New Rising Sun\\". This song was featured years ago on the heavily edited \\"Midnight Lightning\\" album that Alan Douglas produced and botched.<br />  I still like the CD and glad I bought it but it doesn't hold up to \\"Valley of Neptune\\" or \\"First Rays\\".<br />  enjoy
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|The Possesion  was a great movie . If you have not seen this movie you should think about geting it
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Just as good as I would get on my PC!  The detail in the graphics is very nice and the puzzles are delightfully intricate.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Got this for free, and so glad I did.  The grandson's love it, and not only is it entertaining, but it helps with eye and hand co-ordination, which they need. The four year old gets so excited when he \\"feeds\\" the monster...They are better at this than I am.....
B009CPJHY4|1.0|I was very disappointed in the streaming quality of Amazon Prime for this movie.  It would stop, reload, and sometimes go up several levels, forcing me to go through the selection tree again ... I am investigating technical issues at my end, but several times, I received a screen message saying something like ... not available at this time ...
B008P1EWIM|2.0|It's okay to check the temp and that's about it.Pretty but no substance. There are many other weather apps that deliver more information.
B000IYU9IG|3.0|It is hard to believe grown people, supposedly intelligent would write such utter nonsense for such great actors.  Still it is John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.  And there are some surprisingly touching moments between father and daughter that show depth and warmth.  And there is the dramatic defense of the Indians .  Oh, and lets not forget the attempt to accommodate the musical era with a few songs.... Really?  Still, it is John Wayne.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Great story.  Little slow in the middle, but a terrific end.  Very well defined characters.  Certainly worth the read.  Good book group discussion.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Once the upgrade came into effect, the covers of the books are all the same.  Boring.  I can see some covers if I &#34;goto&#34;, but it was better before.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a book you just have to read.  Cannot possibly be described without either turning the reader off or saying too much.  My book group loved this.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|BLUE RAY MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD! LOVE THE CHARTERS IN BLUE RAY... LOKK LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO JUMP OFF THE SCREEN!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|So many times novelist and Hollywood will take a particular piece of work by some of the greatest writers ever published and turn their work into a mockery.  So when I saw Lost in Austen on Netflix a few years ago I was completely skeptical and a little afraid of what I was about to watch.  Turns out my fear was for nothing!  What a little gem of a movie this was and I enjoyed it so much I watched it a few more times before I canceled my Netflix subscription.  So of course when I saw it for sale here on Amazon I had to get it!<br /><br />I'm sure there are plenty of synopis's here in the review section so I won't bore anyone with another, suffice to say all of the main characters were a joy to watch and while the focus is on Amanda Price and Mr. Darcy (both exceptional, I really enjoyed them together), I was most drawn to Jane and Mr. Bingley.  The pain, torture and longing between the two was played by way of both actors that you really felt the emotions.  I feel its always a sign of a great movie or book when you can really &#34;feel&#34; what the characters are feeling.<br /><br />Worth watching if anyone likes Jane Austen!
B0045XICB2|5.0|I LOVE ALL THE TWILIGHT MOVIES I'VE SEEN , ANY TIME THEY ARE ON I WATCH THEM OVER AND OVER .<br /><br />WAYA TSSALAGI JONES
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Always loved this actress, and especially this one. Great classic. Will pass along to the entire family for them to enjoy.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|While it's a beautiful story with an important message, I'm not a fan of the writing style. However I do believe it is an extremely relevant novel and should be taken seriously.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Another great classic. Enjoyed seeing it again. Will pass it along in the family for their viewing pleasure. Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game the Easter egg hunt is my favorite.I have characters spike Jake and tricky.I just love subway surfers!
0307346617|5.0|Creative, fun to read, I could not put it down once I started reading. The interviews are a refreshingly new way of telling the story of the zombie apocalypse.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Super 8; I've wanted to see this movie since it first came out.  This was my opportunity, and it was terrific.  Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's my favorite and first app : ) I LOVE the competitions in the game, you can collect gems but it is very hard because you only get one  when you move up a level!!
B008602KQI|3.0|I didn't read the trilogy before viewing the movie, and now that I've seen the movie, I definitely won't be reading them. Still, it was a decent movie despite the attention it received, not simply because of it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Unexpected twist and great love story. Don't hesitate to read it! :)
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Does everything I need it to do.  So much better than the smartphone app.  I wish I could play my games on here.  That's my only negative.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is a must read! If you are searching for a good book but don't know where to start. Start with this one!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very engaging, well developed characters and story line that keeps you interested from start to finish of every episode. Really just need to say - watch it! You won't be disappointed.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I found this game v very fun to play. It gets you to think of many different ways to compete each level as quickly as possible. Yes. I would recommend this game to others.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is quiet a fun read.  It turns out there really are demons in NYC!  And who better to battle them then teenagers in love triangles?  So it gets a little angst-ridden at time, but if you can get past that it's an entertaining quick read
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a compelling story that grabbed me from the start. I enjoyed the twists throughout the book. It haunted me for days after reading it.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I'm a Neil Gaiman fan.  This is a great story, the characters are quirky and interesting and the world it's set in is just magical.  It's darker than the movie, but i enjoyed that
1439127727|5.0|I am amazed at the facts and new information from the authors, and it is explained by the 80 pages of footnotes.  Although the titles are unique and supposed to be catchy, they are vague and the subject overlaps chapters.  I think the book could have been better organized.  I would have appreciated a front page with the dates each person was president or vice president as a reference while reading.  The overall message of the authors in my opinion is how the past presidents have cooperated with each other.  Maybe it was much as continuing their own unfinished agenda as much as cooperating!  A chapter or two on Roosevelt would have been interesting, and he was referred to as a backwards look in the text.  A great read for book club discussions.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I thought this game was gonna be one of those boring civilation kind of games but its great u wont get bored of it
B009GX69RK|5.0|Season 2 is even better than the first. You've got to love these weird, wonderful characters and the situations they get into.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The best so far out of the three in the series I've read. Some twists I didn't expect. I was sad to see some of the characters go but can't wait to see what happens to the ones that are left.
B002VPE1XE|2.0|By universal, it means it fits giant point and shoot cameras. If you have a newer point-and-shoot, your camera will not be all that protected by it - as the camera is free to bounce around within the case.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This poor child went  through so much but some how came out to be the most wonderful mother.  It's a hard book to read because she went through so much for such a young.  I pray she finds peace and a normal relationship with a real man.  The men she had in her life were not real men but cowards.
0425252868|5.0|I have never read anything like this book as I stay away from war stories. I devoured it in three days and passed it on to my father who served in WWII.  The details of the lives of the soldiers who fought on different sides were an enlightenment to me. I learned surprising things about the lives of ordinary Germans in the build up to the war. Adam Makos made me feel like I knew and understood the men, and he explained the &#34;why?&#34; of so many things.
B0047YIHM8|5.0|I read Band of Brothers & The Biggest Brother first and can say that the film was right on the money for accuracy.  It also showed the almost superhuman level of bravery displayed by these men.  The movie centers on the one group of men from Easy Company..although there were many more men and situations involved.  You could have 20 movies or more covering so many of these historical events.
B0045XICB2|3.0|blah blah blah I was bored watched ...don't sue me I mean really I was seriously bored and I wanted to watch something mind numbing aside from Expendables 2
0525953728|3.0|I got this book because it is itself a piece of history. It stands out from the rest because of the unique story its author has to tell, but other than that... it's just another action novel in an already over-saturated genre.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Oh and Gabriel Macht is good eye candy...I do watch for fashions even though I could never slip into some of the outfits
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|helped with checking my kids spelling vocabulary. you know your getting older when you think twice and have to resort to a dictionary just so you know you give your kids the &#34;correct&#34; spelling
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|While this is a great story I couldn't help but think this is some kind of reflection of our society or is Cicero? Who knows but its cute
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|does what you need it to do. like the feature on this one where you can still read the numbers you entered just below the answer
0385537816|5.0|This set was well worth waiting for! It's beautiful, great quality. Hopefully some day I will get them signed by E.L. James :-)
B00APUTEBG|3.0|The Cold Light Of Day ,I found my review helpful to meself as I was pondering why I rented this movie. This film has a good story-line and moves at a pretty good clip.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I downloaded this book on a Monday and finished it that Thursday....Just as good as 50 Shades Trilogy with a different story line.....Cannot wait for third book...Already downloaded on pre-order....LOVED IT!!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is fun. just hard enough to keep you playing. easy enough for my five year old to play. on top of everything else, it is free...
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I thought it was a great movie but had only saw a couple trailers on it and did not realize it was 90% about addiction.  Good movie for that .
B00BESM14U|5.0|It's crazy in a way how this movie explores a theme nearly all of us have experienced at some point in our lives.  The movie, casting, acting and the conclusion, that feeling you walk away with couldn't have been constructed better.  Lifts the spirits and redirects you, well worth the nearly 2 hours!!
B00BOL3M86|5.0|This apocalyptic society has many struggles they face on a daily basis from a scarce food supply to the undead. The writing has been amazing and each episode has ended on cliffhangers that just keep making me want more. This is one of the most addictive series of the year.<br /><br />Just excellent writing and acting and everyone's life is at risk. No one is safe.
B008SOS63S|5.0|This CD set is @#&*@#* awsome. You gotta hear it if you like blues!!!! I had never heard of him before, but what a great find.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|very addicting! I got the game for me and my 5 yr old daughter to play together and its a ton of fun. we both enjoy the game and love spending the time together!
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Makes me appreciate my Mother even more! Very entertaining account of a talented actress and her neglectful family- a sad story written by an optimistic woman.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Tried many different versions of Slender would go as far as to state that I tried all the free ones, and a few of the other higher rated ones. This version by far is best and closest to the PC version. Get it you will not be disaapointed.
B008OOYALE|5.0|good game......keeps you interested with different dragons and the levels others are on their lands are so neat to look at.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best books that I have ever read. This book made me experience every emotion. At times I felt afraid,  at times I was shocked, a few times I felt happy,  at times I felt angry, confused, sympathetic, proud and a lot of times I felt sad. It was written so vividly that I felt as if I was in the arena with Katniss. There were a few parts that were sort of gruesome, but I did not want to stop reading it because it was so intriguing. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is one of my favorite characters of all time. Without a doubt, this book will be read and loved by many for a long, long time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome app! Play it everyday! YOU HAVE TO GET IT! Only down side is that in the game, some of the clothing and basically all of the jetpacks are too expensive and not worth it's price.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|This song is so good. I love the way Adele sings this one. You cannot go wrong in buying this cd.
B004ADB17Y|4.0|I grew up with this movie and I still love to watch. Ive got my youngest watching the movies I watched when Iwas younger .
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well the only bad thing is the multiplayer, no one plays anymore, but other than that it's great for single player.
B00942X8PY|5.0|this is so much fun I play it in school on the bus and at home! best idea ever! if I could rate it more it would get 10/5
B002RI9UBS|2.0|Interesting in that there were good descriptions of life in that part of India at the time and the book might have got better..... but I ran out of patience!
B007JMW46U|4.0|My son does like reading this book that is a big plus.It gets him to read so thats a good thing
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Excellent story based on a loose interpretation of an historical event. Suspenseful, edge of your seat ending. A must see!
B0063GORYU|5.0|As we grow older it has been suggested we mentally challenge our minds to fight off mental issues.  This is definitely a fun and challenging way to do it. Love it!
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|Paid for a game I can't play.  It won't open.  So I have been ripped off.  Too bad I can't give it zero stars.
0374533571|5.0|Matthew Quick has provided the public with an insider's look at the cognitive functioning of an individual who is suffering with a mental illness in his book, Silver Linings Playbook.  This is a topic that is grossly misunderstood in America and a series of conditions that contain numerous social stigmas in our culture.  Quick shares the story of a young man, Pat Peoples, who has lost everything from his wife to the memories of the last few years.  As Pat attempts to re-enter society, he is faced with trials and tribulations that come from himself, his friends and even his family.<br /><br />Pat Peoples begins a quest to end &#34;apart time,&#34; being reunited with his estranged wife, but ends up running down the path of his past and into the field of his future.  Silver Linings Playbook will give you an in-depth understanding of the alternate reality that many people who suffer from mental illness live in.  Quick offers the reader the knowledge of how to interact and encourage someone who is suffering, rather than giving judgment and condemnation.  I'd encourage you to run with Pat Peoples as he discovers who he is, how he can heal and what it looks like to have meaningful relationships with everyone you meet.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|Some have tried to say this was the next avitar (no way  !!) not even close.  I watched it twice, just to make sure. Avitar i have watched six or seven times and would watch again, and again, and again.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I read this book in 1 day and was upset that the next one wasn't out.  Highly recommend this book.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|It does not go too deep into most of the concepts, it is only an overview. I would have liked it to have more parts regarding Dawkins expertise field, but I guess that for that purpose he has many other books.
B0006419J6|4.0|Several of my favorite actors are featured in this futuristic movie which I have enjoyed watching mainly for the amazing special effects.  Whether I'm watching on a standard screen or use my Blu-ray play disc player to up-convert it to near HD, I find this movie visually satisfying.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|... and with an unexpected final (at least for me). I cannot wait for the next book to be written :-)
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson fans will LOVE it. People who crave great performances will LOVE it. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was - in a word - PHENOMENAL.<br /><br />Those of us who become euphorically giddy over the opening of \\"The Godfather\\" or are enthralled by the majesty of \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" or simply love a story brought to the screen and done right like \\"The Dark Knight\\", would love \\"The Master\\". The first act had me wondering if I had just imbibed some syrupy opiate. Then I realized it was the film unfolding before me. The second act does stretch on a bit, but that is part of the genius of Paul Thomas Anderson. He is prepping you for when it all comes together so beautifully in the last twenty minutes or so. Some people seem confused by Anderson's style of story telling. For me, it's what's so refreshing. Anderson is interested in the drama of the human condition rather than a human's dramatic situation or circumstance. He doesn't hold your hand through the story.<br /><br />\\"The Master\\" does look at the phenomena of cult, and Joaquin's character's encounter with it is the story. There are some faint echoes of Scientology in the film, but one could apply Jim Jones or Heavens Gate just as easily. Anderson seems to be saying that cults have often been a danger in our society because it is a human endeavor that appeals to our very humanness - the never ending search for answers, reckoning and relief from pain. Anderson has not made an attack on Scientology, but a revelation of the seduction of cult.<br /><br />Some wrote here that Phoenix's character has no arc. Bulls***. Story and character arc do not have to slap you in the face. Someone else complained that there are no redeeming qualities in the film. Wrong. Joaquin's character is redeemed in the end. A dramatic change in behavior is not necessary for a character to find redemption. \\"The Master\\" is a masterpiece of film making and story telling.  I highly recommend it to any lover of film in the tradition of Kubrick, Coppola or Malickf Kubrick, Coppola or Malick
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My 8 y/o son is a huge Minecraft fan and HE was the one that found this (playing Minecraft, it came up as an ad) and I searched HiGH and LOW ..you guessed it, sold out everywhere and going for $175.00 on eBay ...  seriously? Well, it's ...<br /><br />1. Worth finding and scooping up<br />2. Age appropriate and entertained as intended!<br /><br />Although he did have some trouble with a few of the pieces and restarting a section from time to time, this is a masterfully designed set. The instruction booklet is SPOT ON.  He builds his larger legomsets in record time but this one had him stumped at times ... So hang in there, keep on mine crafting ... It's worth it!
B0000797IO|3.0|I like Zooeys short but funny performance.<br />The rest of the cast  is pretty good but i dont think they are amazing. Still its Recommended<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
B003Y059EK|5.0|Amazing as an adult :) lovin' the 80' I don't want to write a review, I really just want to give it 5stars!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Does exactly what it says.  The paid version has no advertising, for the tiny amount of money, it's worth it.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|this movie gives a glimpse of the lives of the rich and bored in the '20s. Mia Farrow and Robert Redford never looked better. Sam Watterston and Bruce Dern are also excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story shares a possible future society where the class system rules over the life of its people, especially its children, who are sent out to be killed in the hunger games.  The entertainment factor is more important than people's lives.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I never write reviews..ever..so the fact that I was compelled to review this says something.  I was absolutely thrilled when this was finally released, and made sure I read the 'in between' novellas before I finished it.  Oliver had a really great series going, and is a wonderful writer...so what happened?!  The book was engaging and interesting until the end.  I had a slightly hard time with the hana/lena back-and-forth, but got used to it.  When I read the last page I literally said 'WTF, seriously' ? Out loud to myself.  There is NO closure what-so-ever.  A horrible ending to an otherwise fantastic series.  I am very upset that I spent $11 on this book.  If I had a hard copy, I would return it. Apparently I'm out of the time frame for a kindle book.  I'm mad that I wasted my time, and even more disappointed that Oliver would publish something so obviously incomplete.  Based on my utter unhappiness, regardless of her writing skills, I simply cannot give this more than a 2-star.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|2nd seasons better still yet they keep the action up zombies are great  cant wait for the next weeks episode
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is a fun to play. I recommend it to everyone. Its easy to level up and get further.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|best tv series in 20 years u gotta watch this show just keeps getting better and better action never stops
B0014NDXGA|4.0|Works flawlessly out of the box. Just aim and press the button. The leather holder for the rangefinder strapped conveniently on the side of my bag.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I don't know why I never heard of this movie.  How could I have missed it?  Now having seen it nine years after it's release I can say I don't remember ever having been more moved by a movie.  There isn't a wasted moment or word.  Every actor and character is perfect.  Every visual is beautiful in its simplicity or complexity.  It draws you in so gently you don't know it owns you until you're utterly disarmed.  Keep some tissues handy--you might see yourself in this film and that feeling might melt you.  Thank you Tim Burton for this masterpiece.
1594745692|5.0|If you are familiar with the house wife tarot, this tarot is by same folks.<br /><br />Cute and Kitschy, it's more for collectors or people who are into all things zombie.  I liked it a lot, but I collect odd decks and like zombies.<br /><br /> A person looking for an everyday deck should consider something else (like the Steampunk Tarot).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Do you ever read a book and you can't get the characters or scenes out of your head because they make your heart ache and they make your heart happy?  Or you finish the book and just keep going back to read certain parts over and over?  That's what Hopeless does to you.  It was simply beautiful and beautifully written.  Colleen Hoover's abilities were truly impressive.  Each chapter, each scene felt like it had a purpose and events, dialogue all felt connected to each other at the end.<br /><br />I bought it a while ago because of the number of good reviews, but I kept putting off reading it because of the length.  I have an obsession where I can't stop reading a book until I finish it and so I knew I would be reading this late into the night and was worried having to commit the time to it (you know because of work, kids, sleep, etc).  But honestly, it was a super fast read and I easily got through it in less than a day.  Plus, it's kind of annoying that so many authors out there stretch out stories into multiple books just to get people to pay more (I'm talking to you Abbi Glines, since Fallen too Far and Never too Far should have easily been one book)!  So it was nice to have one complete story.<br /><br />I've read other reviews that complained that this was about high school students and really only for young adults.  But that is ridiculous.  The story is about love between two high schoolers, but also between friends, parents, etc.  Honestly, I did imagine the characters slightly older as I read, but based on where they were in their life in terms of experiencing certain activities, they had to be in high school.  It wouldn't have made sense to make the older.<br /><br />I LOVED this book and am seriously impressed by it.  It was funny, sad and gut-wrenchingly romantic.  I will admit to one last thing - the very last sentence caused me to burst into tears.  Now for a book to accomplish that, you have to agree that it's amazing.
B000062YB1|5.0|SLAYER is a THRASH legend, and the classic REIGN IN BLOOD must be their best album...but SEASONS IN THE ABYSS is a GREAT ONE from SLAYER!!!!! SOUTH OF HEAVEN is great, but SEASONS shows SLAYER at their peak!!!!! All the songs are amazing!!!!!
B008Y73940|3.0|Okay film.. nothing great about story line.. could have been better but the story lacked depth.... can be seen once
B000000H3W|5.0|ARISE, SEPULTURA fourth album, in my opinion is their best and one of the best THRASH METAL albums EVER!!!!!yes, BENEATH THE REMAINS got more attention from the METAL masses, but ARISE is just a perfect THRASH METAL compilation!!!!! All the songs are AMAZING, like a fusion between METALLICA and SLAYER......Max vocals improved A LOT since his MORBID VISIONS days, and on ARISE you can understand what he is singing.....well, this is a MASTERPIECE....I like All the stuff SEPULTURA created until ROOTS, but ARISE is my favourite!!!!!!!! GREAT METAL STUFF FROM THE JUNGLE!!!!!!
B0098XZHSU|4.0|I love this app on my KindleFire HD! Similar to TuneIn Radio ... wide variety of music and podcasts, with recommendations for similar stations, so I am constantly discovering new stations I like from all over the globe! Attractive interface, easy to use. I LOVE saving new finds to my favorites! My one wish is to add Recording capability! Not sure if the 99cents Prime version of rad.io has recording or if there is any difference??? I am not paying if its same as FREE version! But I would pay 99&cent; for Recording capability!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|The story moved well and the two main characters were fleshed out even more. I loved the twist with Xander being part of the rising. Didn't see that coming!
B008JFUN8C|5.0|I don't care at all wht anyone who does not like this film thinks,feels,I don't.<br />I lov ed this film so much,I felt alot in it.  Betrayal when  Theodora got tricked by her evil sister  Evanora.<br />Glad when Glinda was able to win & take back the city.<br />& Of course, loved how Oz tricked the witches & saved them.  He was funny too.<br /> <br />I loved the effects,the cgi was very well done,especially for the more epic parts. Im also glad to see new things for Oz not seen before.<br />This film was darker,& more loud in epicness.<br />& the acting was pretty good. Also funny how Tony cox was all attitude twards Oz,reminds me of a few other char. he plays.<br />& 1 of the things I love most of this film is the world of Oz really was not just a dream Dorthy had,it was real.<br />1 thing I hate is when everything in the end turns out to haved not happened.<br /> <br />If anyof you love this film you have as Scarecrow would say \\"A brain\\". Cause this film is worth it. I already wish I had it after seeing it.<br />See this film. It's great,& powerful. ;3
B004CURZFC|2.0|The movie is slow and not that interesting.  A little scary for my 3 yr old. It is something they can watch but won't be a favorite

B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I bought three All that Echoes albums two for gifts and one for myself.  I thought it was alright but the people I gifted were very disapointed.  I just  feel the songs were wrong for Josh, only one song on the album that I liked the rest were painfuly dragged out filler.  I would say stay away from All that Echoes maybe his next album will be better.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|i purchased this movie for my three young children, but found it to be one of the best movies i've seen myself!! definitely recomment
B001OC4HSE|5.0|My son has loved this movie ever since he was 5 years old. He enjoys the story line and the stop-action animation, particularly the dancing statue.
B000JMKSE2|5.0|Yo me dedico a un nicho muy especifico que es la cerveza &#34;artesanal&#34; o la craft beer as&iacute; que este libro me ayudo a aterrizar todas esas ideas que ten&iacute;a sobre como intentar manejar de un modo u otro el llevar mi marketing y entorno para enfocarlo directamente a un nicho en especifico y evitar perder mi tiempo en hacer el &#34;one size fits all&#34;.<br /><br />Un libro bastante recomendable inundado de ejemplos e historias que nos har&aacute;n enfocarnos mas en lo que tenemos que atacar cuando trabajamos para un sector muy espec&iacute;fico.<br /><br />Dato curioso es que primero le&iacute; el libro de Makers: The New Industrial Revolution y desde este libro, al menos para el &uacute;ltimo ca&iacute;tulo, ya hablaba sobre las impresoras 3D  y el movimiento de los DIY.
B009XTF8JM|4.0|I would actually rate it about 3.5 to 4 stars.  It's a great movie if you are into these types of films.  I also thought that it was interesting that the film presents the subject of possession from the aspect of the Jewish faith instead of the from the aspect of Catholicism which pretty much every other film on the topic does.  So it was unique in that regard.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The full set of seasons 1 & 2 are kind of expensive, but all the disks are great.  All the seasons are wonderful, and Maggie Smith is hilarious!  I'm addicted now.
B008D36INE|3.0|This film starts off slowly and progresses slow for the entire film. It is interesting with a simple plotline. It is worth the free rental but not worth spending alot on. It is an interesting evenings diversion.
B005JABSB6|5.0|Love that these glasses are rechargeable and they have a 2D/3D switch so if someone (not me) doesn't love 3D they can watch the movie in 2D.  Better fit than others out there.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great app.  Fun.  I like how my town earns money even when I am not playing.  Very addictive!!  Give it a try!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  I like books to keep me wanting more and this story did it for me.
B0012FHGCW|3.0|Way too long and repetitive scenarios.  I didn't know how they would end it, but now I know they ran out of money so they decided to kill him off.
B00991TCOG|5.0|bought this on a whim searching for violin music and was NOT disappointed!!  Fun to appreciate all types of all aspects, new or traditional.  Really love her videos too!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have always said that animals are so smart. This a story that is told from the perspective of the family dog. The challenges that his master and family go through are heart breaking. However in the end  goodness prevailes. The book kept me interested.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Beautiful group of classical.  Nice to see &#34;renewed&#34; interest in these works!  Whatever is takes to appreciate!  Highly recommend it !
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|So I have no idea if the game is actually good or not since it wont open. After waiting for it to download on my 1st gen kindle fire it then had to download around 126 Mb. Took some time. But after completing I'd try and start and nothing would happen. Each time I'd reopen the program it would download all over again. I have plenty of space, and my kindle rarely glitches so I'm blaming the programmers on this one. Fix it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really like this game but having a little trouble with it freezing up. Need more options for getting in game coins without using real cash.
B0063IH60K|5.0|User friendly and fun. However the ads that pop up in between each game is annoying.....wish those would go away
B000E9910W|5.0|Great for any doobie fan, a true best of and a great value for all you receive. Great selection of songs.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Ive been using this app for ten minutes and already notice results. I wanted something like Nike plus and this is just as great. I love it and I will use it everyday.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It's a little slow getting started. Overall a good film. The only things that bothered me: 1. a lot of times there were no subtitles when the actors were speaking Farsi. 2. they overused the whole &#34;Argo F*** Yourself&#34; phrase. It was funny, once.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great challenge for kids and I highly recommend it for kids 3-11 yrs old!! I love subway surfers<3 I'm a winner not a quitter!!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Listen, I'm a 32 year old man, and I don't scare easily, but this game is more frightening than any other game I've ever played. I'd say it's even scarier than most of the scary movies I've seen, especially when you play the night version in the fog.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It's ok but diner dash is so much fun. If you have the choice to download one or the other pick diner dash you won't regret it I swear.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|If you read a lot of classics then you will have no trouble reading Dorian Gray. There was too much description and not enough story for my taste. It's worth the effort once you get to the end though.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Many surprises, too many loose ends.  Anxiously awaiting the next installment.  Please don't take too long for the next book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app: it gives a good realistic point of view and is entertaining. I highly suggest this app.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The games a lot of fun but working with gems can be very unreasonable and expensive.  There are certain ponies and shops you have to get to move forward in the game. Many of these cost a huge number of gems. Gems are very hard to get in the game but you can buy them with real money. They are very over priced.
0062014536|2.0|I, like many others, had been anxiously awaiting the release of this final book in the Delirium trilogy. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. If you have not read the rest of this trilogy, you may not want to read this review as there will be some spoilers from the first two books.<br /><br />Requiem by Lauren Oliver takes place right after Pandemonium. Lena has grown into a strong leader of the Resistance, she has broken out Julian, the son of a prominent politician, from the regular world to join the Invalids in the Wilds. But the cliffhanger from Pandemonium was that we find out that Alex is still alive. This last installment is brimming with tension between the three of them. Unfortunately, Lena dissolves into a sad, teenaged girl (except dirty), who is angry that Alex wants nothing to do with her, and immediately, falls back into Julian's arms to 1) make Alex jealous and 2) have someone to hold her and make her feel like someone loves her.<br /><br />The novel is split into two perspectives, Lena and Hana, Lena's best friend, who we haven't seen since the Delirium (or Hana, the novella, if you've read that). Hana's story is more compelling than Lena's, in that we get to see more into her head on events after her Cure, and events that happened in Hana. She has more of an arc, and more character growth than likely any other character in this book. However, that too eventually settles into an expected turnout. Her fiance turns out to be not so great-- but is this really the most compelling storyline we could expect?<br /><br />So reasons why I felt so disappointed: 1) Lena became entirely unlikeable to me. I felt that she and the surly Alex deserved each other and that Julian should just run away and find a girl that was as good as he was. 2) Nothing much happens. The biggest plot twist in the novel was already given away in Hana, the novella. 3) Because of the first two points, I ended up bored and unmoved-- there were also several supporting characters that I just could care less about.<br /><br />I do want to mention what many other reviewers mention-- the ending that's not an ending. Actually, this was the least of my complaints. The issues above were much more concerning to me. However, I do agree that it really keeps the story very open, without resolving anything.<br /><br />I feel that Requiem falls into the pile of ends of trilogies that just did not live up to the hype. I still think that Lauren Oliver writes beautifully, and I will still pick up books that she writes-- but I wonder if she will do better at stand alones-- Before I Fall remains her strongest book, and one of my all time favorite YA novels.I just could care less about.<br /><br />I do want to mention what many other reviewers mention-- the ending that's not an ending.

B0044C5SCU|3.0|I love this show, though the realities of science were pushed a bit more than I liked in Season 3.  Still....the characters, multiple for most of the actors, are superb in terms of the nuances each seems to hold-while maintaining the core of the personality.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is awesome a million times better than temple run 1.You can get new stuff. The only thing bad about it is that there's less characters.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best series my wife and I have enjoyed. Great actors. It just gets better and better. Heartily recomend the series to everyone!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Not quite up to par for Baldacci. It was a decent read, but not one I will likely read again. I'm thinking twice about recommending and lending the book to friends who are also Baldacci fans. I certainly wouldn't use this book to introduce anyone to Baldacci as a favorite author.<br />  There was not a whole lot of character development in this story, perhaps because there wasn't a whole lot of story development. I didn't even invest myself in Puller, the series' center. It felt, at times, like I was reading a short story stretched a few more pages like a half-hour tv show trying to fill an hour's worth of programming.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|A good read: an easy page turner. I thought the ending was a bit weak but not so much so that it ruined the whole book. I shall try another of her books now and see how that fares.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was on a 8 hour bus ride so I was curious about this book I had read so many reviews and decided that I wanted something fun to read. I enjoyed it and made my bus ride time fly. Like I said I enjoyed it. Don't over think it and just have fun reading. Yes all the sex scenes get kind of annoying after a while but the story was entertaining.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I usually don't watch movies like this but my 14 year old daughter watched it on the school bus with a friend on her ipod so I thought I had better watch it.  It was very intense.  I appreciated that considering the theme, there were only a few sex related scenes and only<br />a few scenes where girls were dressed provocatively.  I definately would not watch this as a family movie. and the theme should be discussed if young teens are permitted to watch it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I had a long bus ride and nothing to do so I downloaded the book. I liked the story and if you don't go and try to analyze and think too much it's an easy and fun read. After I finished the first book I wanted to know what else happened so I got the rest.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|A perennial favorite for this Punxsutawney native...I recommend it to everyone.<br />It is a lesson in how to keep trying until you get it right.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|&#34;gotta watch&#34; movie. denzel acting , always makes you believe his characters. keeps you interested , was surprised at the end as well
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Tom Selleck does the role perfect. I believe Robert Parker would be very proud of what he has done with the movies.
B000FC10MU|5.0|This is my first experience with a Neil Gaiman text and I have to say he is one of my new favorite authors. The world of fantasy he creates stretches and invigorates the imagination. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the fantasy genre.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I think that the new show does a great justice to the old show and it charecters. I think MR. Freeman would be very happy with this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers it is the best game ever. You should really get it!!!!! It is fun and cool and amazing. I like Lucy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was a late comer to the Downton Abbey craze.  So, I  recently downloaded the three seasons from Amazon and was amazed at the ease of the download, the convenience to view anytime I wanted and would totally recommend it to any one who would like to get on board the Downton Abbey craze or have the first three years to watch online anytime you want.  Thank you Amazon for my latest obsession.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Oh a must read! Would reread in a heart beat! Can't wait to get a hold of the next one....
1451673442|5.0|I choose my rating because i am satisfied with the book. I anticipated this book being similar to the secret or the power, but it was not. The book did resort to some of the stories or practices. I liked that the book gave instructions on how to bring about the magic back into our lives.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It's the just the right amount of creepiness I was . Looking for. It was fun and challenging<br /> The graphics were awesome and I love the creepy dolls u came across
B000HF0ILY|4.0|semi remake of Shane, but very authentic weaponry and beautiful locations. enjoyed ending gunfight very much.  Very good<br />character casting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book would recommend to my friends. Had me wanting to keep reading sometimes forgetting I had other things to do
B006HGXGWU|5.0|A man sees signs its the end of the world while his family believes he is losing his mind. No spoiler alerts here. Excellent acting all around. I will say there were some parts that seemed slow  and I did fast forward a few times. Do not let that deter you from this movie!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is super as some better than temple run . Aaaaaaaaaaswwwwwwwwome<br />But I also think that they should put new charters
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Even if you aren't in musical theatre you will love it. It speaks to all people trying to make it in any career or job where sometimes you just feel stuck. Love it!!!
B006MW3V6U|2.0|Way too much &#34;soap opera&#34; and not as stable/consistent characters and story line as in season one. Maybe the writers are loosing their way..
B007TXN4TK|5.0|If you like music you will love this one, it is a good teacher to learn and have a lot of fun.
0670026603|5.0|I am not going to do a synopsis of the book, that can be found in other reviews.  I am going to say that this book touched my heart.  I laughed and cried and completely enjoyed the book.  Please read it.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Probably the worst Denzel movie ever. I will never get those two hours or $6 back and that is unfortunate.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|This book is definitely worthy of five stars. I would recommend it to young adult readers. Especially those interested in fantasy.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I kept hearing great comments about Downton Abbey, but I couldn't find it listed in the television schedule.  I didn't know it was listed as &#34;Masterpiece Classic&#34;.  I was recently channel surfing and I came across the beginning of an episode of Downton Abbey, so I decided to watch it.  After seeing this episode, which was already into season 3, I decided to order the first two seasons.  I ordered the DVD version and the only complaint I have is that the last disc of season 2 had some parts where the disc would stop during some of the scenes towards the middle and end of the last episode.  I don't know if the disc has a defect or perhaps it just needs to be cleaned.  I am now addicted to this show.
0307949486|5.0|This is the first of the trilogy and it is superb!!!! I am sorry that Stieg Larsson has passed away as his writings are just superb-well investigated anriveting. I got the following 2 at Costco and was sorry to have to finish them knowing  that no more are coming.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|This battery works very well at charging both my galaxy nexus and my ipad mini. I only use the 2amp USB port, as e other one is just too slow for my devices. It can recharge my phone about 3 times to full before dying, and my gnex has an 1859mAh battery. The only problem I have (not really a problem, just a minor annoyance) is sometimes it will say it is 3/4 charged, but it dies after charging my phone once. I know it must be hard to get battery indicators to be precise, but if they were a little more finely tuned then this would be a 5 star device! I still recommend it, you can't beat the value to performance ratio.
B002OQT928|4.0|So...purchasing this rather than renting was a fantastic idea! The purchase price was the same as about 2 or 3 rentals, and by now my son has watched it easily a dozen times in a couple weeks -- so obviously he loves it. For the adults, it's a good movie, but not great. Appealing characters, some funny moments, and no matter how implausible, the premise of dinosaurs mixing with mammoths is kind of fun. But it's a little thin on logic and the dialogue is sometimes pretty cliched. So if your family only has enough money to buy one movie this year...go buy Wreck It Ralph or Night at the Museum 2: Battle for the Smithsonian, both of which provide far more entertainment for both the kids and grown ups. But as a movie for kids, Ice Age DoD is great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game.  Endless-run, jump over gaps, tilt the mine-carts and zip-line down ropes.  It seems harder than the first version to me, but I love it all the same.  The graphics are great.  I keep accidentally clicking upgrades in the store and losing all my money.  Recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is super fun.you just keep going and going.as a gamer I know fun games,and i'd just say this is a fun,entertaining,and exiting game.download this app for a good time
B0042EVCYI|1.0|The book looked like it had water damage, the binding was destroyed, and it looked like it had been rolled up.  Not &#34;good&#34; quality as described online.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Loved it.sexy yet business is carried on.fast moving. Would recommend to everyone. Was a fun book and will read the next one.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is one of the best first person shooter games I have ever played. Its a focused game and u can play multiplayer on it. Its really fun. If u want a first person shooter game, this is it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I downloaded this to be able to watch YouTube videos where I don't have Wifi, and it was really nice for a while. it still works for me, but it constantly bugs. I've had to shut down my kindle because this app had hugged (I'm assuming it was due to this app) Download it if you'd like, but realize it does have its problems.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Took a little while to get the hang of it, but now it's just a great and challenging puzzle game. Tons of levels!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic. And fun. Hard to put down once you start. Hard to believe its free a real deal. Cant wait to get back to playing.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Freddie was spot on that day....a great line up of sons and a new flawless performance. This DVD makes you fell like Freddie is alive and well for the duration of it. I do miss him though :(
B000JMKRKC|2.0|The story probably would have been good if it were written in half the pages.  The descriptive words make the story so slow.  It was a chore to finish it.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|if you like having game nights with friends where everyone's drinking, these cards are the ones you want. they can be wiped off from anything that lands on them.
B008MEM24S|4.0|ive seen some cruddy apps, but this isn't one of them, worth the 99 cents mainly because it isn't just mindless gaming it takes time and strategy to complete the levels.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|What a touching sweet book about a middle school student that faces up-hill battles every day. Wonder is a great book that reminds young and old readers a like what it means to be kind, caring, friendly, and honest. I think this book serves as a great reminder that as human beings we need to remember to love and care for one another, and that there is no real reason to be mean to anyone. An excellent read for all ages.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's great for doing calculations, but leaves out something for doing convertions. The price can't be beat, the cost is free so not a lot to complain about.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I saw this movie on it's original run while in the Navy. We laughed till we hurt. Sellers made the story.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you like Mahjong, this one is great to play around with while you're waiting in a doctors office or on the bus or just setting around the house.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The trailer did not reflect the bad language or the nudity.  Yes I know it is rated R and that a trailer is designed for all audiences but there needs to be more of a disclaimer for making a decision on.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock comes with a lot of features that you'll love to use. There's a lot of alarms so that you can do more than one or two alarms. There's the tempature and the weather so that you know whats going on in your area.
0062014536|1.0|Terrible ending to what had been a great story. I was really disappointed. The ending was abrupt, confusing and irresolute.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|I love Bond movies I really do, but I don't know how it ends, or middles in my case.  I don't know how it ends thanks to amazon's terrible streaming for rentals.  I have no problems with the prime free content but when I try to rent, the stream is awful.  It locked up my roku and I don't know what to do except have one more whiskey and go to bed...god, you guys are so close to being the perfect place for all my media needs, then this happens...again.  Back to netflix I guess...
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I must say that this installment of the Star Trek movie series was extraordinary; it's rich in special effects, drama, suspense, and even action. What's more is that the storyline is superb and very interesting. In a nutshell, Borgs invade other worlds and assimilate the people to become Borgs. It's a mission to destroy mankind and rule the universe. Unless someone can travel through time and repair the damage, Borgs will rule. This movie is a cross between a Terminator film and Back to the Future. I may be stretching it some, but it feels like it in certain parts. I must also say that if one watches the Star Trek movies in order, it may be hard to get used to the new Enterprise crew, especially Patrick Stewart. However, as this movie moves along (as it does well), the characters develop and are respected. I especially like Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. She plays the part flawlessly, and is very seductive. Krige seems to be made for the sci-fi genre; she even stars in Frank Herbert's Children of Dune in 2003 as Lady Jessica, and does a stellar job. While I still love the Spock/Kirk duo, I still like the new crew and their overall acting. This movie gets my praise as one of the best movies of the franchise. Buy it, and see a different side of the Star Trek universe. 9/10

B007REV4YI|5.0|First let me start by saying that I never really got into any previous Bond movies except for the ones with Daniel Craig....I have seen a bunch of them, they were just not my thing; perhaps its a generation thing.  That does not mean you should dismiss this review as being nonsense or the idea that I do not know what I am talking about.  So let me just say that this movie itself is one of the best movies of 2012.  Most fans would be drawn to the action style of the film, the Bond girls or perhaps even the filming locations.  I was drawn more to the story and mind set of Daniel Craig's character.  It brings home a harsh reality that even the best secret agent cant always be on top of his game.<br /><br />Even the casual fan like myself will catch some of the references to older Bond films that are sprinkled into the film.  It was quite the treat and often brought a smile.<br /><br />One of the true treats of the film is the acting performance of Javier Bardem.  Hands down one of the best villans I have ever seen in any movie.  Given the already fragile mindset of Bond in this film if anyone else besides Javier had played the villain it would have made the movie dramatically different.  I am sure there are many other people who will agree with me on that.<br /><br />I purchased the Blu-ray edition of the film and in typical Blu-ray style the quality is simply amazing. It would have been nice to have the film come in a 7.1 surround sound, but oh well you cant always get what you want.  That fact alone does not effect this review.<br />Its an easy choice folks, go buy this film.
0316228532|2.0|I must agree with the assessment written by S. McKinney. I was extremely disappointed in this book. I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, having read each one countless times. Both of my daughters learned to read thanks to those books as well. This book brought dark and depressing to a whole new level. None of the characters were even the least bit likeable. I had to read a quarter of the book before having a firm grasp on all of the characters and their sick, weird, or twisted ways. I continued to read hoping that maybe the end would make up for the rest of the book but found the ending to depress me even more (though I do get the meaning of it, sad as it was).<br />When JK writes another book, I will borrow that one from the library as I will not be paying for the next, in case it is another like 'Casual Vacancy'.
B002HSSAY6|5.0|This engaging film CONTINUES earning my best score on test of time. Absolutely demands multiple views. Do not cue this movie unless you can view undisturbed. Engrossing. Suddenly it's over. Tight dialog. Super camera work. Extremely enjoyable use of all your faculties and time.

0393316041|5.0|Without a doubt, this book will be on my list of all-time favorites, and definitely the best book I’ve read this year.  In his autobiography – and I use that term loosely – Richard P. Feynman gives you an opportunity to not just learn a little about his life, but to get to know him.  Reading his book is like sitting down with him and listening to him relate story after marvelous story.<br /><br />Feynman was born in Queens, NY in 1918 (actually, I don’t think his date of birth was in the book, but I give it here for reference).  He had a natural curiosity about EVERYTHING, and a father who encouraged his aptitude in science.  He began inventing things from an early age, learned about electronic devices by taking them apart and/or repairing them (like his transistor radio), and eventually took his scientific curiosity to MIT and then Princeton for graduate school.  He was one of the physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project, but instead of talking about the atomic bomb, Feynman tells how he became fascinated with locking mechanisms and proceeded to crack most of the safes in the facility.  It’s stories like these that not only fascinate, but leave the reader astounded that he would 1) dare to do this, and 2) get away with it.<br /><br />Feynman says what he thinks.  Most people who’ve read this book don’t mind this, but there are a few reviewers out there who blasted him for arrogance.  I disagree – I don’t think he’s arrogant at all.  He simply a very brilliant man, who, after learning as much as can about a subject, comes to his own conclusions.  That’s okay in my book.  There are far too many people who come to conclusions after learning little or only filtered information about a subject.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about this book is that anyone can read it.  Okay, there is a little bit about science here (after all, that is his field), but generally it’s entertaining and enlightening and I think EVERYONE should read it.  I can’t imagine anyone not loving this book!t imagine anyone not loving this book!

1451627297|5.0|“Who can know when life hangs in the balance, or why?”<br /><br />When I was in high school, I discovered Stephen King books.  It was the time when you graduate from books of your youth and have an encounter with the adult world.  In Stephen King’s case, you encounter adult fears.  I loved his books then (The Stand is still a personal favorite), but it has been at least two decades since I have picked up a novel by the master of suspense.  Perhaps it’s because as an adult, I no longer wish to read books that scare me, or perhaps I felt I had just outgrown this genre.  When 11/22/63 came out, I held off reading it.  And then review after review came out and even my high brow literary friends couldn’t help but rave about it.  So, surrender I did, and once I picked up this 849 page monster of book, I couldn’t put it down.<br /><br />The story begins (you guessed it!) in Maine, where an adult-ed instructor, Jake Epping, is introduced by a friend to a worm hole.  Through this portal, Jake has the ability to travel back to 1958, and when he returns to the present (in this case, 1986), only two minutes have passed.  His friend convinces him that he has a unique opportunity to right a wrong that shook the nation – to stop the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />One thing that makes this book different from other Stephen King novels, is the historical aspect.  Because so much has been written about the death of JFK, King had his work cut out for him in the research department.  As a historical fiction lover, the author did not disappoint here.  And, true to form, this is definitely classic Stephen King.  There is an element of the macabre, a bit of the supernatural, a tug of war between good and evil, and some great twists and turns.  For the Stephen King fan, there is also a bit of deja vu – there are shades of It in this novel for sure, and probably some references to other King novels that I haven’t read.  This was a great summer read, and a reminder that in spite of Stephen King’s mass market popularity, he is a fine, talented writer.and a reminder that in spite of Stephen King’s mass market popularity, he is a fine, talented writer.

1400031362|5.0|After reading African stories dealing with civil war and genocide, it was such a pleasure to slip back into the world of Precious Ramotswe in Botswana.  For those of you unfamiliar with The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?  You simply must go out and get yourself the first book, sit down and enjoy!<br /><br />Alexander McCall Smith creates such a wonderful setting with delightful characters; lucky readers are pleased to welcome them back in book after book.  Morality for Beautiful Girls (the third book in the series) does not disappoint.  I could almost see Mma Makutsi in her new role as acting manager for the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, and I clapped my hands in delight at her sharp wit and no-nonsense administration.<br /><br />A few months back I rented the DVD’s for the HBO series based on the first few books.  THEY WERE WONDERFUL!  So rarely does a director capture the sense of place and the actors capture the unique characteristics of the charming people in books.  This show does.  Unfortunately, HBO decided not to continue with a second season, but left open the possibility of some stand-alone films based on Alexander McCall Smith’s books.  I sincerely hope they do so.  I, like everyone who has read The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, cannot get enough of it!
0425263908|5.0|Browsing the library audio section I randomly selected BARED TO YOU. WOW!! A terrific surprise as I knew nothing about Sylvia Day's writing. the picture on the cover and the notes on the back understated the content. I so enjoyed the  audio CD that I bought this book and it's sequel, REFLECTED IN YOU. Excellent story line, well paced, well developed, interesting  and likable characters, as well as being a scorcher. Not a sweet romance ----definitely edgy and erotic, but very well written. Better written than SHADES OF GREY.  Both Crossfire Novels received Romantic Times top ratings of 4.5 stars. Can not wait for the third \\"Crossfire Novel\\" due out in June.<br />Anne Alexander
0374531269|4.0|“There were all kinds of stories told about the war that made it sound as if it was happening in a faraway and different land.  It wasn’t until refugees started passing through our town that we began to see that it was actually taking place in our country.”<br /><br />In his very engaging and highly readable memoir, Ishmael Beah narrates his journey as a 12 year old boy in Sierra Leone.  From a trouble-making pre-teen, to coming face to face with a war that spreads across his country like cancer, Beah is forced to journey from his home – on foot – to keep one step ahead of the rebel soldiers, and certain death.  Eventually he finds his way to the army camp, but not before finding out his family has been murdered.  For awhile, the orphan boys were protected at the camp, but eventually the need for soldiers outweighed the army’s desire to protect the children, and they were handed weapons, trained and forced to fight.  After three long years, Beah is rescued by aid workers and sent to Freetown for rehabilitation.<br /><br />While A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier is certainly sad and frightening, there is also a sense of hope.  The people who help Ishmael along the way are like angels sent by a loving God.  This book leaves the reader with many questions.  War and political upheaval are devastating for a country – it’s children especially.  What can we do to prevent these uprisings?  How can we protect the children?  There may be no easy answers to these questions, but without the dialogue, and the truth as shared by Ishmael Beah, the world will not be able to begin to tackle these tough issues.

0307949486|4.0|There’s a saying in my house:  “Don’t say you don’t like a food from a particular country.  If you have a dish that is well-prepared, you are likely to love it.”  I think the same thing goes for genres in books.  While I’m not typically a person who reads crime fiction, there are going to be crime fiction books out there that I will thoroughly enjoy.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one them.<br /><br />Well-written and fast-paced, Stieg Larsson takes us on a whirlwind adventure of not one, but three plots!  Plot number one is journalist Mikael Blomkvist’s attempt to exonerate himself (he was convicted of libel) and sink Sweden’s corporate bad guy all at the same time.  Plot number two is investigator Lisbeth Salander’s attempt to gain control of her life from a violent past.  Lastly, plot number three is the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger, whom Blomkvist has been hired to solve.  The three plots come together in a sensational (albeit sometimes shockingly horrific) novel.  A perfect book for the summer. Now, of course, I’ll have to read the other two books in the trilogy…<br /><br />On the recommendation of my aunt, I also watched the Swedish version of the film the same day I finished the book.  Excellent!  As directors often do, there are some adaptions made for the film, but it didn’t detract from the excitement or quality of main story whatsoever.  A big thumbs up on this one!

0375758992|5.0|“I lie with my arms over the cat, awake and waiting.  African dawn, noisy with animals and the servants and Dad waking up and a tractor coughing into life somewhere down at the workshop, clutters into the room.”<br /><br />Another in my 52 Books Around the World Challenge, Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight is exactly the kind of book I have been hoping for in my quest to immerse myself in another country.  Ms. Fuller grew up in Africa, the opening lines of the book taking place in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).  There is such a sense of place in this memoir, you can see it, smell it, taste it.  And be horrified by it.  And be in awe of it.<br /><br />And yet, it is not just about Africa.  It is about a young girl living, coming of age, and finding out where she belongs.  Because a white girl in Africa does not really belong there, and she knows it.  But on the other hand, it is home, and even when she is grown and lives an ocean away, her soul longs to return there.<br /><br />It is also about the struggles of one very dysfunctional family.  Gun toting, racist, imperialist, daily drunken stupor-ish, impoverished farmers are Alexandra’s parents.  And she loves them, as most children love their parents.  Her descriptions are haunting and loving at the same time.<br /><br />Truly glad to have read this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love playing ice village.  When I earned the chance to go to the dinasour world it was fantastic.  When my kindle lets me know that I have a daily bonus I just have to get on and see what I am able to do.  Thank you for such a wonderful game.
0451418441|4.0|In continuing with the medieval English saga of the builder of a great Cathedral, Ken Follett has followed The Pillars of the Earth with this page-turner – World Without End.  Also set in the fictional village of Kingsbridge, Follett takes us on a journey beginning in 1327.  We get to know the residents of the town, the nunnery and the priory, and some of the nobles in the area.<br /><br />There are many changes happening to Kingsbridge.  New innovations have allowed for the local economy to prosper and visitors from other areas of Europe have their influence as well.  Some are good and some are bad.  When the plague is brought to Kingsbridge, it loses many of its residents and that brings problems of its own.  What we see in this book is a look at the economic, religious, political and social issues of the day.<br /><br />On a plus side, Follett is pretty thorough in presenting the history of the time.  Even minute details about farming and weaving aren’t left out here.  The author also knows how to entertain his readers.  It’s an exciting, romp through history.<br /><br />On the minus side, he presents twentieth century characters in a fourteenth century setting.  I will assume that Follett does this to keep his modern readers engaged.  It does help him maintain a book on the best-seller list.  However, historical fiction fans will be disappointed.  Follett does have his history correct; however, I sincerely doubt that all the happenings of the fourteenth century happened in Kingsbridge at the same time.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the lack of any really virtuous characters.  The heroes of the book are atheists – and one of them is a nun!  Everyone else in the Church is a villain.  You get the distinct impression that Follett is a Church hating atheist.  It’s too bad, in the previous book, the hero is a saintly prior.  It’s one of the things that made the book so attractive.  Good wins out in the end.  No one seems to win in this book.<br /><br />Still, it was entertaining and there is some good history here./><br />Still, it was entertaining and there is some good history here.

0553386794|4.0|“The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray.  Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat.  They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold.”<br /><br />Last summer a Goodreads friend of mine was reading this book and he made me laugh with his comments about how George R. R. Martin was keeping him up at night because he couldn’t put the book down.  I decided to dedicate much of my summer reading to science and science fiction, so I’ve finally gotten around to reading this book.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is definitely exciting and a page turner.  Martin deftly captures the reader and draws him into a world of kings, would-be-rulers, and divided loyalties.  As a lover of historical fiction, I can certainly understand how this type of fantasy can appeal to that crowd.  Set in a world much like our own middle ages, the intrigue and political games mirror much of real history.  But in this novel, because it’s fantasy, we have some sorcery, and some strange, once-human, murdering creatures beyond “the wall”, in the northern part of this fabricated kingdom.<br /><br />I was almost finished with the book, when I remembered hearing that this series isn’t typical – in A Song of Ice and Fire (the series name) good does not necessarily win over evil.  Yes, Martin does throw in several twists where the hero takes a fall, but I’m still holding out for the good guy to win in the end.  I’m also looking forward to reading the rest of the books and watching the HBO series!

B0033H7VI6|5.0|Purchased this &#34;knife&#34; after coming across it somewhere on the web. Checked it out, read reviews, etc etc etc. You get the idea. Anyway, ordered this knife after all that, and when it was delivered, dang I was impressed. Nice full tang blade, nice handle grip (I'm not savvy on all the correct terms of knife parts), heavy but balanced. The knife snobs won't like this, but I know of a couple friends of mine who have far more expensive blades, and this one outperforms theirs, every time. I have abused this, used this, and other than some finish marring on the blade, still going strong. I sharpened it right out of the box to get rid of the factory grind marks, and came up with a good smooth edge that has held out through chopping, splitting, and making feather sticks. For the money, it's one of the better deals out there.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Holy crap...I think that's the fastest 432 pages I have ever read! Just finished reading &#34;Reflected in You&#34; by Sylvia Day and can say I am glad that I decided to read the second book in the series. The first book, &#34;Bared to You,&#34; was a pretty decent read, but left off in such a shoddy spot. The second book was so much better than the first and seriously that doesn't happen often with books and movies. It did lag in a few places, but I am glad I gritted my teeth and buckled down. So I recommend it to any folks out there who has no problems with darkness (rape issues especially, but no actual rape scenes) and steamy sex scenes. However, you will definitely want to read the first book before diving into the second book.

Overall, I did like this because it was never too predictable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Easy interesting read . Thought I had it all figured out half way in but discovered I only had about 10% right.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie! Intense! Emotional! So well done. Totally recommend it! A+ movie. Would watch again and again and again and...
B005K17RU0|4.0|i have the weather channel app also and this one is so much better and esier to use. love the current radar screen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great App, but needs more things to get energy. Needs a way to win gems...Wish it didn't have ads. Nothing else to say.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Really? Scary? It's hard to be scared when you fall asleep playing it. I'm sorry, developers, but this &quot;game&quot; has no challenge to it. A picture of &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; that you concentrate on only to have a freaky face pop up after a few seconds is scarier than this. Even an episode of Scooby Doo is scarier.<br /><br />Amazon needs to compare the IP addresses of all the five star reviews. Something's not right.
B000VRSTEQ|5.0|Aerosmith is the greatest rock and roll group of all time and this album highlights some of their biggest hits all in one place.  Amazing album!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once I start watching, it's hard to stop. The characters are richly developed and engaging. I can't wait for the next season.
B000VZJUGY|5.0|Unless you are a Nine Inch Nails hipster, the odds are that the first Nine Inch Nails song you heard came from this album.  Wether it is Closer, Hurt, or March of the Pigs, this album is chalk full of gritty, raw industrial greatness.
0765325950|5.0|&#34;Exquisite.  Let the word stand on its own.  If it is the right word, it will work without help.  If it's the wrong word, adding other words to it will just make it seem desperate.&#34;  Thom Merrilin.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run so much I play it all the time. Temple run is awesome and I think you would like it just as much as me!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Basically as many reviewers have stated, this is loaded with bugs on kindle fire. I love this game and it works great in my SGS3, but I have experienced 3 different crash points in just 20 mininutes of downloading it! I first had the loading Imagine screen boot error so I reinstalled. I then played a few rounds without issue on a fresh install, but then my kindle rebooted at the end of a run for no apparent reason and all my progress was lost. I wanted to turn off tutorial and adjust the graphics, but adjusting any of the setting, including just turning off tutorial,  froze my fire. So I played through tutorial, thinking one run was necessary to disable it, only to find that it now freezes on the tutorial run as soon as you die. Until this is out of beta mode on the fire, don't waste your time...seems to be the buggiest on this device. Otherwise, its a 4.5-star game IMO.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2. It is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone! Its the coolest game there is!
B00338QENI|5.0|As a physician having heard and read about He La cells for decades had absolutely no idea of the history behind it.<br />Ms Skloot has done a most marvelous job of in depth scientific research woven with the human emotions to bring out a book worthy of the Pulitzer prize.<br />JR
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|When I have trouble on my homework and schoolwork I just open up my calculator and it helps me with my problems.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My wife and I both loved this film. It brought back a lot of fun memories of playing videogames at an arcade.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome hope the next one is better<br />Wonder what happens next maybe she kills snow this is going to be awesome
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I purchased the soundtrack after seeing the movie.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the movie.  I've never seen the Broadway show so cannot compare it to that.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love it so far. I just started today, so I will update this if that changes. Runs wonderfully on kindle fire HD.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It has been a very long time since I've read something that I wished wouldn't end.  Martin paints such a picture with words.... I am impatiently awaiting the next installment.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I give this book five stars.  I recommend this book be read by everyone who  has loved and lost and found themselves drowning in their grief.
B000ID3KU6|4.0|My neighbor loaned me the movie and told me I had to watch it.  He was right, it was very good.  The director is the same one who did Clint Eastwood's \\"spaghetti westerns\\" trilogy.  So it is that type of movie.  Limited dialog, great sets and scenes, original music, plenty of action.  It starts out with a very interesting scene at a railroad station.  Seeing Henry Fonda as a bad guy seems a little strange but he was great in the role.  The other three stars, Bronson, Robards and Claudia Cardinale, were also very good.  Bronson plays the Eastwood \\"man w/o a name\\" role and pulled it off.  Cardinale is a beautiful woman (a whore from New Orleans with a good heart - like the whore in Lonesome Dove).  The movie is set mostly in northern AZ and the 4 Corners area.  Great color, intense closeups etc.  A classic.  If you like westerns you will enjoy this one.
0900652985|5.0|This book, by its author, was recommended to me by a fellow collector of ancient coins.  I spent quite some time looking for it, until I found it in Amazon.com (thanks for that).  Mr David Sear is a well known and knowleageable individual in ancient coins.  This book is remarkable and I'm very happy with it.  However, it would have been nicer if the prices given were in US dollars.  But, it is still a great book and I would recommend it to any collector of ancient coins, young or old.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Very fast charge time!! I was skeptical, but it really is very fast. Would definitely recommend for anyone who doesn't have time to wait around for their Kindle to charge.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I could watch this movie over & over. One of my favorites. It was a good family movie.  My daughter loved it. No fowl language. All the family could watch it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This author was an M.D. specializing in the brain.  With the fact based brain operatives described and the actual journey he took to heaven, was difficult to dispute, and at the same time comforting in the belief he knew what was fact and what was the proof of his journey to heaven was and is.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I recently got the NeoCal Advanced calculator from Amazon's App store as a free download. The calculator handles just about anything you can imagine and can be set to use either algebraic or RPN entry methods. The only downside is that NeoCal Advanced normally costs $9.99 which is a bit steep.<br />I have been using RealCalc for a year or so and it was quite a bit cheaper. It doesn't do quite as many things as NeoCalc but it is quite good.
B005V5WBFG|3.0|I downloaded McAfee Mobile Security on my Kindle Fire HD and original Kindle Fire to use with my McAfee All Access subscription.  I've used McAfee for years, so I trust its antivirus features.  What I was really excited about was the remote lock and location features.<br /><br />I had lots of trouble with the location feature.  It's not an option for the original Kindle Fire and it doesn't function on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;.  The lock and alarm feature took a long time to take effect.  I thought it didn't work, but it does.  I have to wait.  When it does work, it was pretty funny.  My daughter got a kick out of it.  The Fire started screaming over and over like it needed help.<br /><br />So, even though the location feature doesn't work, at least the antivirus scan, and lock and alarm features work.  I give it three stars for being partially functional.
B00499QUK2|5.0|The dynamic interactions between these modern versions of Sherlock and Watson are compelling, the cases are interesting, and the cinematography of London adds a great deal to the ambience.  I like this version of Sherlock Holmes much more than any of the others - for instance the new Elementary.  The acting is well done, and it becomes its own fresh variety of storytelling, beautifully executed and self contained in every episode.  I can't wait for the 3rd season.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|The Hipe 8 LED motion-sensing light is pretty bright.  Installation is easy with the included screws.  We are also provided the option of using a hook and loop patch that adheres with adhesive.  I tried that, but the adhesive did not hold and my light fell off the wall.  The screws work much better.  Because of the way it mounts with the screws, I recommend it on the wall rather than on the ceiling, and it needs to be low enough that a person walking past will trigger it.  I put it near the floor.<br /><br />The motion sensor works every time I pass it and the light is pretty bright.  It would be good in a small closet.  For the hallway, I prefer the Hipe 3 LED light, because the light is directional and can be aimed towards the floor.  It also has a cool installation feature using a magnetic mount, but I digress . . . .<br /><br />This a good light, brighter than the Hipe 3 LED.  Great for lighting small areas.<br /><br />This product was provided for review by C & A Marketing.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|There is just enough imagination combined with fairy tale madness and warmth to keep one on one's toes in anticipating the next bend in childhood stories...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|can be very addicting! my 8 year old daughter and i love this game. just wish there were more ways toearn gems by not buying them.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Nice hidden objects with a story line game.  Well worth the price.  The opening scene was a bit dark--great for atmosphere but not so great for hunting objects.  Also, the touch interface seems a bit klunky, so I am sometimes misled into thinking I have touched something inert.  I will try increasing the brightness.  5-star potential, minus 1/2 for image and 1/2 for touch, equals 4 stars.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My six year old daughter really likes this game because she like watching her teenage brothers pay Mindcraft but she does not like the monsters. This is very similar to Mindcraft but there are no monsters.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|My husband and I wanted more Downton Abbey when the season ended, so we watched this version of Upstairs Downstairs. It is set in the build up toward WW2 which was a very difficult time in history. But it is well done, and worth watching.
B007SGM084|4.0|I did not know what I was getting into when I purchased this book. I sampled a demo before buying it and thought I was getting something along the lines of Twilight. I got much more than that and found myself embarrassed but not enough to stop reading.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|We have enjoyed Downton Abbey, so my husband and I decided to watch Upstairs Downstairs. It was produced in the 1970's....enough said?!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I downloaded this for my 6 year old daughter who said she does not like it because there is no freedom to do what she wants to do and the game makes her complete &#34;missions&#34; without any real free choice.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Read all of this books and this one rates near the top. Realistic modern day plot, non-stop action, very little filler. Buy this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Six year old daughter loves it because you can get new people and jump on ropes and over rivers and you never die.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app!  Engaging, fun.....additctive.  It ranges from easy to quite difficult, and there are hours and hours of puzzles.  Definitely recommended.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|It is too confusing.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.  I can't  seem to get past the fact that I do not have enough green stuff to feed my animals.  It tells me to buy a dinosaur encampment, but I don't have any money.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Good game but looking is choppy and you can die from like 30 feet away from slender man but fix that and awesome game
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I love Mahjong, but it seems like I am not getting anywhere.  It is fairly easy, but there are not enough different set ups.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I recently placed an order for watching an instant movie &#34;SkyFall&#34; on my HD tv and $20000 system. I was totally disapointed. Although my system is working perfectly on Dish and Netflix through a Sony PS3 in HD and dolby digital 5.1 the sound from your site was extremely poor. Could not get dolby digital but only Stereo. No center channel and no rear channels. THe front channels were out of phase and did not provide a cohesive location. I probably wont be viewing any other movies from your site although I am a Prime member if this is to be expected. As far as I am concerned you owe me a refund for the poor experience.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|Difficult subject, great cast, very moving. The young boy is a marvel, well acted. I was surprised at first that it received Oscar nomination for best picture, after seeing it I understand, it's that good.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|We rented this horrid movie. The classic bond movies with all the clever gadgets, exciting exploits, and so on are simply the best. Save your money.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is a perfect example of the new genre trending on the Net: Boomer lit. Boomer books feature &#34;mature&#34; citizens struggling with the next phase in life after they have left behind their working years. It is a time for &#34;re-self discovery&#34; and this is exactly what happens to Harold Fry. He has just retired from a tedious job as sales rep in a local brewery and when he sets out to visit Queenie, an old friend he hasn't seen for many years and who is dying from cancer on the other side of England, his quest is more about finding himself again than finding her. Though he will do that too, and the end of the book, while devastating to both Harold and the reader, is in fact highly satisfying and fitting for a novel that is a quintessential quest story.<br /><br />This is an outstanding novel, all the more remarkable for being a debut novel, though the author has a long experience in writing radio plays for the BBC. Dialogues are perfect, predictably so perhaps for a playwright, but the description of nature and people reveal the talents of a novelist. Harold's mood is echoed by the countryside he traverses, the people he meets. Each encounter is an occasion for him (and us) to learn more about him.<br /><br />The book is well structured, in counterpoint with his wife who has stayed at home while he walks across England, slowly gathering an unlikely - yet entirely believable - following. Some readers have objected to this almost grotesque expansion of pilgrims walking with him, but I certainly enjoyed it. In our time bedeviled by Internet and Social Media, when people photograph any event they come across with their cell phone, the gathering of followers as Harold keeps on walking should come as no surprise. It is well staged, totally believable, and an ironic comment on our times.<br /><br />Indeed, everything in this book is totally believable and it is fascinating to follow Harold's pilgrimage in search of self, his wife, his love, his son, everything he once stood for and believed in. A very satisfying read and I'm looking forward to Rachel Joyce's next book...e once stood for and believed in. A very satisfying read and I'm looking forward to Rachel Joyce's next book...
B008476HBM|5.0|I have the actual book, rather than just the computerized version. I love the book much better but its nice to have this one on the go.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This remake of the 1990 sci-fi thriller went beyond great. It gave the feeling of what could actually occur because of out-of-control governments. Great action and over the top thrills. A must see for any sci-fi enthusiast.
B007CRTNWK|5.0|The book was in very good condition and it came timely. There was some type of playing card in the book maybe used as a placeholder and forgotten but that didn't bother me. I'm enjoying the read and just an FYI nothing like the movie.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|An outstanding animated film. I love Merida's spirit to be her own woman and choose her own destiny. The depiction of the Witch in the woods was a very good portrayal of wise women in those days, though the answering machine cauldron was a very funny touch. She was not made out to be evil but in the end...be careful what you wish for, you just may get it. Highly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was by far the very best book I have ever read. I have already bought the other two books and the movie. I recommend this book to ANYONE and EVERYONE. welcome to district 12, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|The occasional comic touches that Robin Williams brings to the movie offsets the extreme melodramatic tone. A very emotionally charged movie that deals with the concepts of life, death, heaven, hell, and reincarnation. Some concepts are a little far fetched and &#34;Hollywoodized&#34;, But all in all a very good movie...bring the tissues (LOTS)
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Such an interesting story, great actors, and really good music/score. Held your interest and is certainly a must see movie!
B001XUJMZK|5.0|This movie is a classic love story set in an awesome time in history.  Great acting and story line!  Gibson is awesome.
B00457WZEI|4.0|The book is far better than the movie. I liked that the story was told by the horse. Definitely recommended!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Must read!! Great series you become part of this amazing couples crazy sexy lavish life. Can't wait to start number 3!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good ending to the trilogy. It took me awhile to get into the series, but I'm glad I stuck with it!
098478280X|5.0|It's great resource to review all of your basic knowledge. It goes over both theory and practical applications. About the only issue I see is that this book is only for review. If you don't have any previous knowledge of a subject covered by the book, it probably won't help you that much.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Took me until the halfway point to like the book, but once I got there I was hooked. Great series!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. I am 10 but since I love horses, I love this app. I love how it looks so realistic and there are no ads popping out of nowhere.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book, it was the best one out of the trilogy. Had a great ending and I was sad when I finished reading the series. Highly recommended!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|A very relaxing game, can be played by all ages but enoyed the best by older people.  Colors are outstanding.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was my least favorite in the series, but still enjoyable. Would still recommend and can't wait to see the movie!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I see many negative reviews here because the script does not have the seriousness or depth of the LOTR movie trilogy. I can only imagine that these people have not read The Hobbit. This movie, like the book, is a lot more lighthearted than LOTR. And it came across to me as very well done, and I hope the other two continue in this fashion. So I say: Well Done Peter Jackson. And to potential buyers: don't let the negativity throw you. This movie is well worth owning, and only Blu-Ray will do it justice.<br />However, like many others I will wait until the extended version comes out...although as extended as this movie already is (no complaints, just an observation) I can't imagine what could be added.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was my least favorite book out of the trilogy, but it's still really good. I loved this series in general!
B009CF7GRY|4.0|The subject matter aside, a big city kid in a small town upset because dancing is illegal is a little dated, but this remake is enjoyable for fans of the original movie with Kevin Bacon.  The general plot and characters are the same, but the setting is more updated.  Willard steals every scene he is in. A nice throwback to the original in Ren's car and an amusing tease with the tractors in the showdown scene.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Was a gift for my boyfriend. We loved the movie and showed it to his entire family. Very good story too, would recommend to all! Good seller experience too, arrived fast.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|this game is the bomb because wait there is only one problem why is the dog 3 coins and it barley gives out any hearts anyways I'd say my fav. charecter is the cat especially with her noisess I love how it gives you rocket carts and metal carts and I this my friends will love this game because I know what they think about
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this series at first, but so glad I read it! I liked that there was a story throughout too, and not just kinky sex. Highly recommended and can't wait til the movie comes out!
B008VZAJWK|5.0|I just loved this movie. It was a great story. It was intense yet funny at times.  The cast was very was very well chosen.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book wasn't what I expected. It kept your interest, but it was a really twisted and super messed up story. It was recommended to me by a friend, but I'm not so sure I'd recommend it to others.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|Great insight to why the classic rust in peace line up never got back together. I also never knew Dave had such a problem with drug addiction. Loved the book.
B000HT386M|5.0|Such a good movie with an important life message, everyone should see this movie! Great actors too. Will watch over and over for years to come.
B0084I9QI2|4.0|I bought this for my daughter because she loves michael jackson. I would recommend this item for your great listening and viewing pleasure.
B000TIO4Z0|5.0|It's all of Callas's studio recordings -- what can I add to that!  And on a per/disc price (under $2) it's cheap.
B008OOYALE|4.0|really love this game! do wish that the new update would work on my kindle. cant get some of these one Color dragons without purchasing them. there are a lot of teamlava games that don't update on the kindle...
B004T4KKSA|4.0|Mr. Yergin has researched this very well. I have worked in the oil industry for 38 years and I am learning new things with every page I read. I am also impressed with the world history as it relates to oil.<br /><br />A rather long book but a very good read.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|ENJOY GRISHAM OVER THE YEARS...THIS BOOK WAS DIFFERENT & CLEVER<br />DIDN&#34;T GET A FEEL FOR THE CHARACTERS ,BUT WILL READ HIS NEXT.
B001YV502C|5.0|2027: Society is about to collapse due to infertility; it's been over 18 years since the last birth. Theo Faron agrees to escort a young pregnant refugee to safety- to escape the chaos. Children of Men is a dark, violent look into a bleak future.<br /><br />Children of Men is a deep and meaningful film; a cautionary film with many themes and messages. However, the film is as entertaining as it is meaningful, as in, you can easily ignore the subtext and enjoy the thrilling action sequences and bleak cinematography. The action in this film is spectacular, edge-of-your-seat chases and war-like sequences. The film does have a \\"shaky\\" cam, so those with motion sensitivity should be warned; it is a great effect when used occasionally, but this film does use it a bit too often. The ending of the film is bittersweet and compelling, I enjoyed it. It's beatifully shot, with great cinematography and choreography, it has great acting, and an excellent, haunting soundtrack.<br /><br />The Blu-ray of this film looks and sounds spectacular. Definitely a high quality disc, and definitely the definitive version of this film.<br /><br />Overall, Children of Men is a brilliant SciFi action/drama film with deep themes and spectacular action. I highly recommend a purchase.<br /><br />This film has strong violence and gore, some nudity.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|addicted to the series.  I was annoyed sometimes with the &#34;connecting&#34;  issues midstream and one friday night when I could not access the premier episode at all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Ridiculous & highly enjoyable!!!  Fun to play alone or with someone else.  Makes you think a little, laugh a little.  Yay.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This Is A VERY Good Album . Maybe It's Just Because I'm In Love With Bruno Mars ! I Would Recommend This to All of My Friends ! This Is Very Good . Keep Doing Big Things
B00466HM28|1.0|The component inside, where the cord plugs into, just fell off the circuit board.<br />While it worked, it was great, but IMO cheaply made.  Guess you do get<br />what you pay for.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|It could be the low expectations I had going in or, perhaps, that I am Russian and was able to appreciate the subtle cultural nuances that were carefully, I might even say obsessively, weaved into the film but I found this to be a surprisingly joyous watching experience.<br /><br />I've read Anna Karenina twice and both times I found the novel to be a daunting exercise in unrequited love, boredom and horribly random suicide.  But this film was different - it was luscious, beautiful, well orchestrated, and I dare to say, the most fun I've had watching a self-inflicted death unravel.  This interpretation is more light-hearted than the book, which I think made the film that much more friendly to mainstream audiences.  I recommend.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I was told by a mentor to read parts one and two, but the book was so good that I finished it. WIthout this book, I wouldn't be on the path to greatness that I am on today. One day I will meet Eric and thank him dearly (as I am sure most people who read this book will do).
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I love this band, and their new CD!<br />Buy it, Love the songs,<br />a little countryish writing is supurb<br />and I love Kenny Loggins and his new<br />partners

0307346617|5.0|definitely one of the best zombie books ever written if you love zombie as much as i do recommended this book to qutie a few of my friends and they loved it as well
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I would highly recommend this book not only to adults but to be taught by parents to their children and by teachers at school. Following this principles is the key to joy, happiness, tranquility and peace. This book changed my life.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I love this movie,  I've watched it about 100 times. The cast is great. Can't get enough of Colin Egglesfield.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|The carbide side of this sharpener is pretty nasty on blades, but will give you a working edge.  I would only use in a emergency backpack or on knives of little value.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|No problems before I downloaded this app. After downloading Net would disconnect every 2 -3 minutes. UNINSTALLED after 20 minutes. No problems now And then I tried to install the cloud player.... can't find the widget... and it is also unstable on the site. I try to play something and it will just stop playing.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|For casual players it's relaxing and addictive. The dragons are adorable &amp; the descriptions are very witty. Enjoyable all around.
B002LC8HF0|2.0|There are many reviews the cover the details, so I'll just say:<br /><br />I loved the first book.<br />I found the second book swung between ok and good for me. (Vin's interactions with the kandra was the highlight for me.)<br />I was really disappointed in the third—I only finished it for completeness sake, not because I was enjoying it. It felt to me like it swung from reading reports on crop yields and troop movements to the ramblings of someone who thinks too much. Either one would have been fine if limited, but I skimmed past many paragraphs due to the repetition.<br /><br />There are those that rate this last volume high, so it's obviously down to taste. My main issue is that I feel it lost the wonderful interactions, wit, and forward momentum of the first book. It actually comes across to me as if a different author wrote it.<br /><br />The end of the second book does not make for a good stopping point, so I wish I had stopped after the first.
1616550414|4.0|I disliked the packaging it came in,ultimately damaging the edges of the book. But the person who received this gift couldn't care less.<br /><br />It's worth giving it to a hardcore Zelda fan.

I only finished it for completeness sake, not because I was enjoying it.<br /><br />The end of the second book does not make for a good stopping point, so I wish I had stopped after the first.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I'm editing the review as I think I'm doing Sanderson a disservice by commenting on my negative feelings about the last book, as the pluses of \\"Mistborn\\" more than make up for that. I wanted to note just how much I enjoyed this book: the humor, connection with the characters, the dynamic story... Loved it!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It's an ok movie. Pretty funny and well acted. Falls back onto its *SPOILER* vomit jokes too much. Probably won't watch a fifth time.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I do not know why they made 2 temple runs it was useless.number one was better.the second one was worst.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Glee makes me gleeful! It is well presented and lots of fun to watch; the themes are powerful realities of young people's lives and the music and dance is professional.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It's the funnest game ever till world 3-1 cause it just kills u off entail it glitches and gives you all the levels automatically unlocked then it is no challenge you can just go to wear ever you want
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely incredible. A wonderful ending to such a horrible event, well series of events. I hope the movies match even half of what happened in the books.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fringe keeps you guessing from start to finish and the characters are all very enjoyable. I would say that Fringe is a full head and shoulders above any other show in its catagory.
B00933JF74|4.0|Would give a better review but, this has a very learning curve with in documentation anyhere.  I's pay for the docs, right now figuring them out is a game too.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The 25th anniversary performance of Les Miserables is a beautiful production that includes a new cast of singers, those currently appearing in the ongoing show and many of the original cast members as well singing in a special choir section.  Alfie Boe as the lead tenor singing the part of Jean Val Jean wows the audience with his beautiful and powerful voice.  Others singing in the main character parts are remarkable as well.  It would hard not to need a tissue or two at the end of this amazing and moving story.  As a bonus, three others tenors who appeared as Jean Val Jean (including Colm Wilkerson who sang in the original show) join Mr. Boe in a special performance of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; that is just beautiful.  If you have ever seen and loved this show, you will really enjoy this 25th anniversary performance.  And if you have never seen it, you are in for a great treat!

B007REV4YI|3.0|Great Blu-ray transfer, audio is near great - (TrueHD not DTS). But IMO, this one &#34;overall&#34; was destined to sag just a little. It would be a lot to ask any movie to hold up to the previous two; (Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace).<br /><br />It's very hard to lose Judi Dench after being raised adoring her unmatched portrayal as &#34;M&#34; - but now days it seems a light thing to kill off major cast members, similarly to the way they also seemingly wrote off the old Aston Martin DB5.<br /><br />A younger geek replacement for &#34;Q&#34; is also a minor twist in the road, but overall Daniel Craig does an excellent job of guaranteeing that Bond fans have much to look forward to without worry. This one had its moments - I don't mean to suggest it was a &#34;loser&#34; - or anything like it. But it wasn't as good as the former Bond installments for me -  and so I look forward to the next one.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|five stars not only for the realistic action scenes but the plot was fascinating when it picked up. Great action.
1907563202|5.0|Cute and Easy Crochet<br />I found this book easy to follow and the projects I tried were cute and easy! :)<br /><br />I am a novice at crochet, but I was able to follow the directions.  Some patterns I probably won't make, but the book has wonderful ideas and different types of projects.
B0099KJFJ4|3.0|I was interested in this movie because i am a Van Damme fan. I have seen Cung Le in a few fights on TV and his style caught my interest. What also caught my interest was the plot of this movie; which was good. The action was acceptable. The ending took away from anything the previous scenes did to highlight the movie. They should remake the ending. Seriously.
B0034G4OWM|3.0|It was okay and had some funny parts in the movie but it isn't one that I would tell my friends to buy or even watch.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I had as first heard of the hunger games I was like who cares. Then I saw the movie preview and I wanted to see it. Then after I watched the movie I had to get my hands on a copy of the series. I read the entire series in two weeks. It is one of those books were you tell yourself your going to read just a few pages and then you find yourself five chapters later. I have never read a book with a plot Like this before. It was new and fresh. Suzanne Collins is a genius! Me and my friend are obsessed with the hunger games. Very highly recommended. You must read it.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Fun for one viewing, not so much for two-- I saw it in theaters and really liked it, but then when I watched it with a bunch of friends a second time for kicks, I actively disliked it. The writing has zero quality, and a lot of the plot just seems unnecessary. I realize this movie was just an excuse for Channing Tatum to take off his clothes, but I wish he had tried a little harder. I have other problems with this film based on my own opinion of luring young people in need of a paycheck into stripping, but just on a technical basis, this movie is awful.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|pizzas awesome!!! but i dont no pizzas has alot of cheese im not going to talk bout this game cuz in not bornin im awesome
B001KZG99A|4.0|A fun action movie-- RDJ doesn't disappoint, and the supporting cast is very good. My only major disappointment was that Terrence Howard decided not to return for the next films.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This is a great feminist movie for kids (boys and girls), because it really focuses on an adventurous princess whose chief motivators are not solely to do with getting married and producing an heir. It may start out that way, but it turns into the tale of a mother and daughter, and of a girl overcoming her personal demons to fight for her family and dreams. Well done, Pixar!
B00498YZH8|4.0|You can tell why Jennifer Lawrence was noticed for her role as Katniss in the Hunger Games-- her character's life here is just a few restrictions short of being from District 12. That said, don't come to this looking for a fantasy world-- it's pretty grim, and apparently quite authentic, as the filmmakers consulted a lot of locals as extras and consulted them for accuracy. Definitely not for anyone under 14.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was fabulous, and the entire cast was strong across the board, although Rebel Wilson completely stole the show, in my opinion. The music is incredible-- I own the soundtrack, in addition to the film.
B008YI91HS|4.0|A fascinating story with a Frankenstein-like pall. However, I honestly prefer the book over the movie-- it's MUCH more exciting and the scientific research that Crichton used that didn't make it into the film was amazing. If you want more than just dinosaurs chasing people, I'd recommend giving the book a try as well as its sequel, The Lost World.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|One of my favorite animated movies-- I love the supporting characters as much if not more than the main characters, and as an only daughter of a single mother, I laughed until I cried over some of the lighter dynamics between Rapunzel and her mother. Adults and kids will both enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's good but ads keep popping up when I play it . Although it is fun to play when you are bored.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|i dont get how in the beggining it says that spencer has blond hair when in the classic t.v show she has brown hair. other than this the book was great.
1476734941|5.0|I've spent most of the better part of the last 2 decades slowly adding pounds.  I would gain, then level off for awhile, maybe lose a little - mostly from increasing my exercise, not cutting back on food - the weight would start that upward track again whenever I cut back on my activity.<br /><br />Well, when I finally stepped on the scale in Nov 2012 and it said 265 lbs. on my 6' frame, I knew I finally had to do something.  I've never really been on a diet in my life so I knew I had to find something that sounded the easiest for me.  After researching WW, Atkins, and various others, I stumbled across the Horizon program by Dr. Mosley almost by accident.  Only 2 days of pain, but could eat normally the other 5 days?  Sounded like a dream for us big eaters, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />I started on Dec 3, 2012 and by Feb 18 I was down 33 pounds, surprising even myself that it's been this easy.  I followed the diet pretty much as stated, fasting 2 days a week.  My `fast' days did vary from week to week, and there was 1 week that I fasted 3 days instead of 2.  I usually ate only one meal during my `fast' days, usually in the evening, and I tried to keep it around the 600 calorie limit for a man.  I might have gone over or under that limit a few times, but it was never more the 100 - 150 calories either way.  On my `feed' days I ate pretty much normally, but didn't overdo it...but I still ate sweets, burgers, chips...I just didn't stuff myself.  I've found it very true that the fasting does do something to your appetite (or maybe your mind)...I am not as hungry on `feed' days.<br /><br />I won't lie to you though...sometimes the `fast' days can be a little tough.  Some days I breeze right through them and other times it's a little bit of a struggle.  They do seem to get easier with time though, as your body adapts.  It's never so bad that it is unbearable, especially when you know you can eat normally the next day.  I think this makes this time of a diet vastly easier when you know you can `cheat a little' the next day.<br /><br />I might add that in a little experiment with my body I stopped fasting for 3 weeks to see if I would rapidly regain some weight.  Again, I didn't overdo it during this period...just ate normally, without the `fast' days.  The good news is that I didn't gain back a pound during this period!<br /><br />So as of this week I'm back on the plan.  As I am writing this I am in the middle of a `fast' day.  I definitely think this is a plan I could stick with for a lifetime.  Perhaps when I reach my `goal' - whatever that is, I will only fast 1 day a week like Dr. Mosley does.<br /><br />Highly recommended and thanks Dr. Mosley!<br /><br />UPDATE 4-13-13<br /><br />OK, it's been a little over a month since I restarted the 5:2 way of eating and I'm down another 7 lbs. since I wrote my review, so it continues to work for me.  I fasted an average of 2 days per week (one week during this timeframe I did 3 fasts, but the next week I only did one).  I plan on losing another 10 lbs. (at least) and then I will see how much more I want to lose from there.<br /><br />UPDATE 6-13-13<br /><br />It's now been 2 months since my last update and I have lost another 8 lbs or so since then, bringing my total loss at approximately 47 lbs....not bad considering I didn't fast at all for about 5-6 weeks - scattered kind of randomly - since starting this diet.<br /><br />The weight loss has slowed, mostly because I haven't been quite as strict as I was earlier.  I am still doing 1-2 fast days per week, but I seem to be eating more on my non-fasting days.<br /><br />Still, overall very effective.

B009EP3DJM|5.0|I was leery about buying this after how great the last two albums were. Seems like I have gotten into a new artist then they suck and start changing their style after getting a fanbase. There is different, and newness here-but still cool in your face Kesha style. Love love love Kesha!
B00511ONPG|5.0|I love the book and have made it part of our training at OgilvyOne Athens. Every new employ has to read the book... And the old ones.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|maybe it was just me but this game ran terribly on my kindle fire. given I do not have the kindle hd or the new model of the kindle, but it just did not run smoothly enough for me to be able to even play. it had a lot of potential and seemed really fun, but like I said it was just not playable on first gen kindle fire.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, I'm looking forward to see if the movie makes it justice. Reading it highly recommended.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Couldn't put it down. The ending, as others have stated, a little far fetched, but I enjoyed the book.  Looking forward to the next book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Like the best game in the world, next to Angrybirds. Really good graphics and well structured for kids to use.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|A brilliant movie - everything from concept to execution.  What is particularly satisfying is the treatment of Catholicism/Faith and actions in wartime.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|Leave it to Clint Eastwood to score on political incorrectness.  Playing grouchy, curmudgeonly Walt Kawolski in his film GRAN TORINO, Eastwood hurls racial slurs and insults by the barrel--and gets away with it.  Why?  Because his Walt Kawolski is very believable; he's a throwback to an era time has passed by, and he's a bystander to a community and a neighborhood so fundamentally changed he no longer recognizes it, and it angers and confuses him.  A widower much estranged from his two sons and their families, Walt's world consists of a modest two-story he's owned for more than 50 years, his dog, and his prized possession '72 Gran Torino.  He's not happy at all his neighborhood is being settled by scores of Hmong immigrants; and he's not about to take any guff from the local Hmong gang wreaking havoc in the area.  He grudgingly befriends a brother and sister living next door (Bee Vang and Ahney Her), which sets the stage for the inevitable showdown with the gang.  And the showdown is a guaranteed heart breaker.<br /><br />Again, Eastwood's racial snarls and politically incorrect bluntness work so very well because most of us know some seniors who call 'em as they see 'em, feelings be damned.  Yet Walt does go on a journey of his own, as he eventually learns a modicum of tolerance and acceptance.  And, he also has his own existential reflection as he comes to grips with the notion of death.  It's this existential element that leads to the powerful climax as Walt confronts the gang and makes that fatal reach inside his jacket; yet Walt also realizes by paying such an ultimate price he is also saving the only people he truly cares about.  One star off as the film does meander at times in its uneven delivery, yet it won't take away from your enjoyment of Eastwood's tough-as-nails GRAN TORINO edge.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked this book as well as the first two but there are a few key moments that make me feel disappointed or wanting more. First, I didn't mind that Prim died but I feel like many of the characters especially Gale didn't even care. Second, I don't understand why Katniss` mother didn't even visit her in the hospital or even when she was sent home. You would think a person who has lost her daughter and husband would at least spend some time with her last living daughter. I really didn't care about Katniss choosing Gale or Peeta but I feel like Gale and Katniss were such good friends and really understood one another that he would of least said goodbye to her before she returned to district 12 or at least visited her in the months when she was regaining her strength and will to live. Overall I liked the book especially when she killed Coin and I knew that this book would focus more on war and Katniss struggling to come to terms with who she is and what she did. I also was glad that there was an epilogue.
B005LAIGPA|3.0|Teen age hormones are tumultuous enough; pile natural law-defying telekinetic powers on top, and you've got the mess that CHRONICLE delivers.  A story told from the point of view of \\"found\\" footage via handheld cams, CHRONICLE follows the antics of three seemingly normal teens who come across something other-worldly, an object giving them superhuman powers.  Suddenly they can move objects with their minds, manipulate matter. . .even fly.  And it's all grand fun until the most unstable of the trio, brooding Andrew (Dane DeHaan), gets his proverbial knickers in a twist, resulting in carnage and destruction on a most impressive scale--with his good-intentioned cousin Matt (Alex Russell) flying through the Seattle heavens desperately trying to stop him.<br /><br />And it's darn fun to watch.<br /><br />The shaky, docu-style type of cinematography climaxed with [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]], making CHRONICLE look like a tired copycat.  And the ad-libbed dialogue of the trio using their new powers to play practical jokes works, for a while, until it grows thin once the story moves to its inevitable dark side (\\"Andrew's in trouble!  Andrew's in trouble!\\").  There is really little to like about the teens once we get to meet them, so when bad things begin to happen to them there's nothing to compel the viewer to care; yet what CHRONICLE lacks in story and content is cancelled out by stunning visual thrills.  Who doesn't love a train wreck?<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|...which I discovered after watching and truly despising \\"Cabin In The Woods\\". The breathless praise of the story and special effects and the acting by the Amazon review is so overblown it is nauseating. It all seems to melt into the Transformers into Batman into Spiderman into Sherlock Holmes... Cars flipping, skyscrapers crumbling, generic metallic alien drones with advanced weaponry being destroyed by... Scarlett Johansson?<br /><br />Wisecracking heros with forced antagonism between Captain America and Iron Man. I've just seen this all before over the past 5 or 6 years and it is little more than popcorn matinee entertainment, which is alright, but certainly not original or interesting. Not bad but souless CGI, which is apparently Joss Whedon's specialty.<br /><br />And a flying aircraft carrier? I'm racking my brains, trying to remember if that was in the original 60's comic book, but I'm guessing Stan Lee thought that ponderous and hackneyed, a relic of WWII. Whedon should have taken the hint, or at least come up with something a little more original, but originality is apparently not his forte.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game makes my brain think in new ways.  I enjoy the colorful pipes and find it challenging.  I love it when it says I am perfect.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This dvd is from an old Audrey Hepburn movie. It's a great movie and hard to find. It was worth the hunt.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This one book opened up a whole new perspective to photography for myself. Anyone who delves into the world of photography needs to read this book to get the complete understanding of the basics of photography. Not only will you never shoot in Auto mode again, you will instantly see the endless possibilities of creative photography. This should be required reading reading for every beginner and amateur photographer out there. This book will answer every question you've had about 35mm SLR and DSLR's on how to shoot in all kinds of light! Wish I had read it sooner!

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a good hidden item game.  It kept me busy for days.  The only thing I had a hard time with was some of the items were too dark to see and had to use the hints to find them.  Great story, too.  I'll certainly play it again a few times.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|When you go to lakeside trials sometimes you will have one more jump to do and it won't let you do it for some reason it will just end the competition. Otherwise it's a great game fun.
8184950500|5.0|CD was great and covers Hitlers rise to power, war and fall from power.  He should have stopped after Czechoslovakia, the Baltic's and the Ukraine, and maybe the French (who fell after only 6 weeks).  You get to see a lot of the Fuehrer. The book is also nice in that I've seen other copies that are just huge and weigh about 5 pounds, but this one is printed a little smaller, but still readable and the pages are lighter.  Hitler was a master propagandist, and Barack Obama is his socialist contemporary although he is too lazy.  All Barack wants to do is play golf all day and basketball.  The GOP would do well to learn from this view of propaganda.  Leave out the rants about the Jews though!  Sometimes I wonder why Barack only will support the Palestinians.
