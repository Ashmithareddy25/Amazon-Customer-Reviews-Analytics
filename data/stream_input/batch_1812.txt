B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I enjoyed this emensely, like the other Nolan Batman movies. Though, honest to the comics mostly, the fact that they dwelled on &#34;having a symbol&#34; to keep Gotham on track is the stupidest thing.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Its a flash mob!  This is one of the cuter movies I have seen lately. I loved it the first time I saw it and waited to get it on dvd.  JT and Mila have great chemistry on-screen.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is so fun not as fun as the Pc version because there is no linking or crafting that I now about otherwise this is a awesome gam
B002VWNID6|1.0|In order to watch this you have to flip the disc mid way.  I took the wrapper off and saw that on the insert.  SO I sent it back
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|Perfect &#34;greatest hits&#34;, covers all of their albums and sounds fantastic.  Only song I wish was on there is &#34;Bron y Aur Stomp&#34;.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|I really wanted to see this movie when it first came out and finally got around to purchasing it.  Good story line.  Lots of naked though.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I usually love Mitch's writing, but I had a hard time keeping up with this one.  It all fell together in the end, tho.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I really liked this, and wasn't expecting to as much as the previous installments of the franchise. More often than not, by the third installment of a movie like this, writers rely too heavily on references to older material and do not want to break new ground. Here, those references were there, but more subtle, and the writers spent more time developing a new arc to the story. Overall, in the spirit of one word movie reviews.... Fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was SOOOO disappointed when I finished this trilogy.  Haven't found anything since that captures my attention.  Loved all three of them!!
141694737X|5.0|This is a wonderful book and great for practicing animal sounds for the beginning talker. Also its one of the few flap books that we have that my son has not managed to rip the flaps off!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was SOOOO disappointed when I finished this trilogy.  Haven't found anything since that captures my attention.  Loved all three of them!!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It has a nice shell and a kick stand for your kindle. Very nice to have when you don't feel like holding your kindle to your face. You can easily prop it on your end table or kitchen counter while watching movies. If the kids are running around playing and knock it off the counter, you can feel comfy that it has a shell around it to break its fall.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was SOOOO disappointed when I finished this trilogy.  Haven't found anything since that captures my attention.  Loved all three of them!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been a fan of The Piano Guys for quite a while and was so happy to finally own a CD with some of their best works on there.  I've discovered that it's perfect study music, and these guys are so incredibly talented!  Their music quite simply makes people happy!  My favorite track on the album is Arwen's Vigil; gives me chills every time I listen to it.  If you happen to like a lot of the current popular songs on the radio, but also have an attraction to classical music, this is the PERFECT blend of the two.  Watch their videos on YouTube; there's no way you can watch/listen to them and not be impressed.  You really can't go wrong with these guys.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Played Hot pursuit at full HD with no additional graphics at full detail minus one level with ease. it's pretty great since most games can hardly utilise 4 threads now.. i7's with 8 threads felt like a bit of an overkill.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Love, love, LOVE! this new album. Had previously purchased 2 EP's before the full album was released. LOVED them as well! FGL can do no wrong!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The moment I was introduced to The Piano Guys over a year ago, I was absolutely mesmerized.  I had no idea that music could be taken to that kind of extraordinary level.  What I love (absolutely love) is that our entire family enjoys their music.  There isn't a generation gap with these talented guys.  It's a total \\"one size fits all\\" kind of music.<br /><br />What I find to be the brilliance of this group is the way they can take the nuances of songs we have heard before and work them into magical pieces of art for the ears!<br /><br />They put their hearts and souls into each piece and it shows!  They truly are the real deal!<br /><br />They have our collective 10 thumbs up at our home.  Good job bringing extraordinary music back into the hearts and souls of people!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|These movies just keep getting better! I love seeing a NEW bad guy for a change! Love the ending!!!!!  Can't wait for the next one!
B006P4HFH6|3.0|I guessed the basic premise in the first few episodes, no real twists there. The show fell off for me after that point. It quickly became a spectral soap opera and lost most of its spooky elements. It's an interesting show, but far from being a horror.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A MUST-HAVE album for the household! it is so good to see TRUE musicians making headway! every track on the album is brilliantly done. this album is listened to daily!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It's like watching a continuous horror movie week after week!  This show is amazing and the producers have done a phenominal job.  If you love horror movies you have GOT to watch this show!
1575666286|5.0|Great book, miracle therapy.  Some parts repetitive, however overall a great book.  Easy to understand and modify if you are not seriously ill.  Went out and bought a juicer and LOVE juicing- I feel great.
B000FC0ZAI|5.0|I brought this book by mistake thinking it was the book about the movie, no it is about World War 11.  I really enjoyed reading this book, as it has some history about the war that I did not know.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put the books down, fun to read!  Waiting for the next set to continue the series!  Wonder what the author will think of next!:-)
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Sean<br /><br />I really think Tim has done it again. My fiance and I love the recipes in his new book and I look forward to mastering them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent book, lots of twists and turns! Definitely keeps you up late at night turning pages! Will read more from this author.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen this year. I really like the way they made movies of each of the characters and then brought them all together for one big movie event. Kinda connects you to the characters and the movie. Hope they keep it up.
B004AKCME8|5.0|This is a great family movie. This price could not be beat! We are very happy with this purchase.This deffinately gets 5 stars!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Out of this series with the new batman, I liked the other two better. I really had a hard time staying with the third movie. I did, however like Ann Hathaway's role as cat woman. I think she did a great job.
B00005N6KG|3.0|These headphones are nice--they provide good sound, fit well, and are very light.  I would prefer a little more of a snug fit inside the ear, though, as they do allow a bit more outside noise, such as traffic noise, into the ear than I would like, but that might be a safety consideration on the part of the manufacturer.  The bad part about these headphones is that they break easily.  That is, the wires inevitably get pulled and you lose all or part of the sound in one earphone.  My last pair lasted about four months.  I have a whole drawer full of these headphones that have all lost partial sound in one earphone.  The only reason I keep buying them is because they are cheap and I would rather keep replacing inexpensive headphones than high-end models.  They all break, regardless of the price!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie, and happy with the dvd.  Not for younger kids, but for teens & up.  Quite violent at times, and some adults don't like it that teens are shown killing each other.
B001USHRCK|4.0|I'm told by my son that my grandson has played with this set regularly since receiving it in November for his 9th birthday.  He is asking for more accessory lego smaller sets to augment this large village this coming xmas.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|the proven formula of multitudes of 'action hero's' was improved upon in the sequel.<br />This movie is just FUN!<br />They really capitalized on the experience and stage presence of the dozen plus big stars in this sequel, I can't wait for expendables 3
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|I enjoyed this, realised I had rather missed Rebus. It's a good read, very similar to other Rebus novels, though the addition of Malcolm Fox gave added interest. We didn't get enough of Fox, I thought.
1423140605|5.0|My son started this book on Sunday and has hardly put it down. He loves the book so much that he is almost finished with it.
0385535147|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book, but decided to read after getting a good deal. It is a good story especially if you are interested in the legal system. This is my first John Grisham book.
0399160450|5.0|Another great novel by TV, on the Campus.  I love Jack Ryan, Ding and John Clark.  Great characters and plot.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|There currently seems to be a lot of interest in E.T.'s and human origins. I thought the movie was great and maybe in some ways plausable. Definately entertaining, plus a cliff hanger!
141659521X|5.0|Mitch Rapp is an outstanding character.  His evolution has shown character growth as well as fleshed out his character.  Good read.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I have seen nearly all episodes from all seasons of Dexter. It is, in my opinion, the best series out. 5 stars!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are amazing! I could and do listen to them anytime of the day or year! They are truly blessed with god-given talent!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|If you were a fan of the original &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; gothic soap opera, you will really like the Johnny Depp take on it.  The original did not take itself terribly seriously, and this parody certainly doesn't!  Loved it!
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Very slow to start and horrible to try and follow.  I am all for an intelligent film that makes you think but this just made me think ugh!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|i always love this movie the singing and the drama of what was happing back then, and strong performence by julie andrews and christoef plummer bring it to the front. i got to see the live play past summer, incrediable performence by lady who played the mother superior. and also lady who played mother supieror in the movie singing to julie andrews,
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend to anyone. Loved it. You cant read just the first one, you need to read all three!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|this is one of the top ten xmas movies of all time. with out a doubt john payne and maureen o;hara, and young natilie wood bring the true meaning of xmas to the for front
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting throughout. A great subjec--going back in time--that I always find fascinating to read. the last sectionb andending was very interesting
B005HSL626|1.0|its a cool, fun game. and I can usually handle ads pretty well. but I draw the line when they pop up in front of an active game as I'm playing it. its just too much.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I thought this was a a great indy type alternative film. Very intertaining low budget film. The film sound and video was high quaility. This is a must see
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Not his best.  Had a pretty good ending (not what I wanted, of course), but it worked.  I just felt that it was a little slow, and sped up so fast at the end, and then it was over.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are consistently excellent!  Their music is engaging, musical, and often surprising.  I highly recommend them to any listener who is looking for intelligent music that will evoke tender emotions, fond memories, and great fun.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|l am looking forward to the next season already and hope Joan finds a good man. Excellent performances and great stories.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|My boyfriend and I saw this movie in theaters, so when I saw it on here for only 10.00 I couldn't resist getting it for a christmas present. I am using the trail version for amazon prime, and I might actually purchase it now because I ordered this yesterday and it already came. (One day later!) :)
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Terrible all around. Not engaging, not much of a spectacle, no messages or peculiar questions per se, the plot is beyond trivial. Compared to Dark Night I'd give it minus two stars. Compared to an ordinary comic-based movie it's 2 stars.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|The shipping was fast and prompt which was good because I used it as a Christmas gift. The movies was a little scratched up though which was unfortunate but it still played perfectly.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|Although this move is long it is a work of love.  Salma Hayek is the producer of this film and she has several friends working on it with her.  Julie Traymor does the sets and  is known for staging &#34;The Lion King&#34;  Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, and other familiar faces play major roles in the film.  Wonderful!
0385336950|4.0|It was a very good book and it was very interesting. The book itself was in perfect condition. The shipping was fast and prompt. I have no complaints.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Not since The Collector have I read a tale such as this. This is a real page-turner right down to the last page.<br /><br />I won't give any details to spoil the story.
B00633PFQC|3.0|The author's basic argument is well-taken -- it is not appropriate for everything in life to be driven by market forces. He provides many convincing examples toward the beginning of the book, but gradually slips into increasingly inconsequential examples. What the book lacks is a solid philosophical foundation for the argument. This omission leads to some odd conclusions. He seems to suggest, for instance, that selling the naming rights to a stadium is just as bad as delaying or denying someone basic health care because of his inability to pay.<br />I also found the book to be annoyingly repetitive, as though he needed to pad his text to reach a certain number of pages. Perhaps he has been infected by the writing style of his students.<br />Overall, the book could be worthwhile as a conversation starter on the morality of our economic choices. It is worth reading, but don't set your hopes too high.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|9 times out of 10 it has a fix instantly (even from a cold start). Only occasionally (probably because of it's current location in my car) will it need to be moved into a different location to get a fix and then it's almost instant.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I watch every YouTube and I have purchased their music.  I love it, especially when a new one gets posted!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I was suprised at how well this last Batman adventure was done.<br />I reallyenjoyed & the almost 3 Hr. movie was over too fast.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Fast to ship  get and was a good deal. Love this Movie Blu-ray Makes better ! ! ! ! !
B007SSDS24|2.0|couldnt get past the girls freaking out in typical girl fashion, pisses me off. the commercials really captured the best parts TT.TT
B00021HBGS|5.0|I thought this would be a good christmas Presant for a young child. Hope they enjoy it. Waiting to hear for them.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am very impressed with Mr.Martin. This has become of my favorite series ever. I simply can't wait for the next book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|One word that I would use to portray The Piano Guys is \\"brilliant\\". A group of great men with a vision of creativity and determination on their minds is what brought them to where they are now. Their love of music has been shown on a completely different level. They've pulled the modern music we have today and brought them back to the past where Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and many other classical musicians have helped shape our music today. The Piano Guys have created this musical cycle.<br /><br />This cycle has brought uplifting music into my own heart. These talented men have brought me more enjoyment in times of celebration, and they've also lifted me up in times of misery by using their loving power of music. The Piano Guys are a group of heart touching souls. I thank them for filling my life with more uplifting music to listen to and I pray that they will continue their brilliant work.
B004RL9T50|5.0|Loved the movie. Its meant for a bit older kids, 6 and above. The adults had fun watching it too.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been a fan of the PianoGuys for some time, following them on YouTube.  Their fresh take of modern music using classical styles is fantastic.  Catchy and energetic, it is a fantastic collection of some of their best music from the Internet.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|great app  havnt had any problems on my evo.just as good as the app on my pc.just wish i had more money to spend
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Highly, highly recommend this show.  The first season is really funny.  It's really hard to find a good show these days that isn't reality trash or something you just have to watch every week.  Well worth the money.  Would probably recommend for young adults?  People between the ages of 20 to 30ish. BUY!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Knowing what a minion looks like made the movie worthwhile for me, but the humor and gooey sentimentality makes it a great story for families and the villians make it enjoyable for the grouches. It has something for everyone. I wanted to see it so I could understand the New Universal Studios attraction, but really had fun with it.
1904994679|3.0|30 years ago, the Guinness World Record Book was something akin to an encyclopedia of the weird and fanciful - emphasis on \\"encyclopedia.\\"  This new version is more like a popular magazine of trivia.  While no less interesting, it is not the tome of old, which for me was quite disappointing.  For my young son, it is a fun read.
0345803507|5.0|Best boook ever, i have ordered all three and love the condition they were in.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|special effects were great and enjoyed the action scenes. I did not fall asleep during the movie. Nice spin on a old story
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read the book and saw the movie. The movie was good simply because it followed the book so closely. Read the book and then see the movie bring it to life in living color.
B005DZMODI|5.0|Can't go wrong with this one it is a wonderful cd. The sounds are just what you would expect from these two.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Great Suspense movie, the plot and the acting were superb! I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different than your average commonly seen plots.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|WELL, This app is a great app. Everybody with a Kindle Fire should download this for their Kindle. I would really rate this like a 5.78 out of 5 in my opinion. It is VERY useful.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is the one my kids (ages 6-11) beg for when we're in the car.  Their favorites are What Makes You Beautiful and Cello Wars.  It's a pleasant sound with a bit of humor and some nice side-by-side tunes.  Great for a family to enjoy together.
1452110581|5.0|This was a fun birthday gift for a cat-loving friend. Much hilarity from just the title. Had a lot of fun reading the various &#34;cat poetry&#34; also.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|A good,(and happily separated out) helping of covers,including the vocally ambitious &#34;Roundabout&#34; balance out this latest offering.A playful happy vibe pervades the original cuts,(as per usual) but one cut threatens to subsume all of the others.<br />&#34;Atmosphere On The Moon&#34; is a must hear if you've ever owned a Steely Dan album!!!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Cowboys. Aliens. Harrison Ford. Seriously the only way this movie could be better, is if there were also dinosaurs driving pickup trucks.
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|Very long and sometimes difficult read. Has very little tolerance of religious believers, very scientific with some very logical arguments. Probably would not read again.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I surprised that Amazon didn't check the contents of the disc. I received mine with one missing disc in the bluray case.
B0058DRUV6|3.0|This is a good book, however, I bought it electronically. If I purchased the actual hard copy I would be selling this one back to Amazon.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Fast, east to navigate, and easy to access. Definitely beats loading from a web browser. Would recommend to any Facebooker.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As always it is spell binding and a book that is hard to put down. Waiting for his third book.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|But be WARNED, the camera is low mega pixel and the picture quality is REALLY bad. The app works as described. Can't blame the app for the S****y camera, so 3 stars. Not worth the buy though. Should be free.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I purchased this book after I stumbled across it on Kindle recommended titles.  I'd just finished 11/22/63 by Stephen King, and I was looking for something that could hold my attention for a while (and hopefully provide a little more substance than Stephen King -- although I have nothing but praise for 11/22/63). I was pleasantly surprised.  Follet masterfully develops his characters. The story lines and the way the characters lives intertwine over the decades is compelling.  The antagonists are loathsome, and the heroes affable and their emotions familiar. I couldn't put this one down for two weeks, and I was devastated when it came to an end (fortunately Follet came out with a &#34;sequel&#34; in 2012). If you enjoy character development you will like this book.  The backdrop set in a small priory in England in the 13th century is also intriguing as I've never read any historical fiction from this era.  I've been recommending this one to all my like-minded friends looking for a good read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Me and the hubby take turns and pass lots of time goofing off on this game. I would even pay for it.
B000GW8OXC|5.0|The deluxe edition vinyl of 'Stadium Arcadium' is without a doubt the most sonically superior and dynamic vinyl record I have ever heard. Steve Hoffman really sets himself apart as an incredibly skilled Mastering Engineer, unlike Vlado Meller, the Mastering Engineer responsible for the sonically inferior CD version and disasters like 'Californication.' The album comes in a shiny box with two booklets, one for each half of the double-album, and the album is split into eight sides on four individually sleeved LPs, each with different artwork. I would also like to point out that this item ships incredibly fast. I received mine well before the expected date and I live in New Zealand which is half way across the world from the USA!
B006Z949XY|5.0|The first Happy Feet I didn't care for too much.  I thought it was too simple sweet sacchrin.  Wasn't into the subliminal messages or the music so much.  I am totally picky about what movies I let my children watch.  This movie , However, is a Family Fav .  The music is great, the kids dance around tons!!!  The plot lines are wonderful too.  Lots of archetypes for them to pull from now their post-cinematic imaginations.  This is a really wonderfull kids movie!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Just not up to par with his other books - repetative and slow most of the time. What was a good subject didn't work out for me.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Another solid book from Abercrombie.  Not quite as violent or dark as previous series (how could it!) but a good story with an actual happy ending beleive it or not.  LA story akin to the western frontier, cowboys and indians. Highly recommended.
1400049628|5.0|I have just flipped through a few pages and I already love it. My friends and I are kinda going through a zombie phase and are totally hooked on planning for the zombie apocolypse. I mean this book is really entertaining, i got it for myself and as a gift to another friend.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Couldn't put down. Can't wait for next book in the series. Highly recommend.<br /> Great book no matter what<br />Your usual genre
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I've read all the Jack Reacher books from the beginning of time.  I enjoyed this one as much as the others.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the journey of this story. I hated when I had to put the book down. I looked forward to reading whenever I had the chance. Definitely worth the cost of the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really great series. I would highly recommend this author and any books that she writes. Very enjoyable to read and will probably read them again in a few months.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I REALLY EXPECTED A GREAT QUALITY AND I GOT IT WHEN I RECEIVED THIS DVD. THANK YOU FOR THE DVD.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These were great reading and was looking froward for the next book in the series. I was very disappointed. After writing 4 great books he came out with a stinker.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater with my two grandsons they loved it and wanted me to get it when it came out on DVD! It is wonderful entertainment for both children and adults.  Has a wonderful story to tell and great humor!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really great series. I would highly recommend this author and any books that he writes. Very enjoyable to read and will probably read them again in a few months.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Omg!! This book was AMAZING!!! I could not put it down from the minute I started reading! It's not your typical love story, but the tension that is between Abby and Travis makes you feel as if these were one if your friends! Lol So, if you're looking for a page turner and ready to go through a serious of emotions! This the book for you!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really great series. I would highly recommend this author and any books that he writes. Very enjoyable to read and will probably read them again in a few months.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This final book brings the whole story to a satisfying conclusion! I will miss all of the characters, whom I have grown to love over the course of all three books.  I enjoyed this book the best!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|THE PANTHER  COULD NOT WAIT TO  GET BACK TO THIS BOOK EACH NIGHT.NOT A FAST READ LOTS OF INTERESTING INFORMATION.  CAROL HOLLAND
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a Great read that continues the story in a nice fashion.  I enjoyed the character development.  If you read the first, you must read this one!
B005LAII12|3.0|First of all I rarely give movies any more than three stars. In todays world, there just arent 4 or 5 star movies anymore.<br /><br />I was looking forward to receiving this today and watching it tonight Dec 11, 2012.<br /><br />At the purchase price of 9.99 I figured I could buy it, watch it and donate it to a library or something.<br /><br />Instead on the delivery day I got an email from Amazon saying the purchase price was wrong. (Checking the site its really $16.99) My order was cancelled and I have to reorder if I still want the item.<br /><br />When I worked for KMART many years ago they had a policy that anything that was not priced right, too low, sold for that price. Would be a good policy here to keep the natives from getting restless.<br /><br />I'll watch it when it comes on FIOS.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It lives up to all the hype!  This is the one that started it all!  It's a delicious guilty pleasure!
B008XOXGCO|4.0|This is a great album, don't get me wrong.  I just happen to prefer their older stuff.  A lot of great collaborations.
B0088WFZQG|4.0|It is very good for exactly what it is, an action movie. Lots of really cool shots, any action guy will like this.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|The game is ok, but it is not as much fun as the old atari pacman. Its ok, another race type game.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Lived up to all the hype. Season 2 is even better. Give it a try, 13 hours of TV is cheaper than 2 hours at a movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I loved these guys when it was just Jon Schmidt and his friend.  They are so talented and brilliant. Their arrangements are beautiful and innovative.  Anything they play, EVERYTHING they play is worthy of download onto your ipod.  You won't want to miss even one of them.
B00319ECGK|5.0|This movie is a classic, and the blu-ray makes it even better to watch all over again. Go ahead, take the red pill
030758836X|5.0|This book is fantastic. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good psychological thriller. It has a lot of interesting and unexpected twists and turns, which keep you addicted. I enjoyed reading this book so much! Well done Gillian Flynn!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I am a grown man, and like this movie. My wife forced me to watch it, but was surprised I really enjoyed it.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I enjoyed some of this book - but found that it required constant reading, not one for dropping for a few days.  It's a real life story, sad and difficult at times.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It's a pretty good show.  Lots of action and effects.  I didn't give it 5 stars cause I would like a little more depth, but, overall,it is a very entertaining show.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|But, the rest of their albums all sound the same. Pity, I love Adam, but their music is just they same sounds over and over.
B0035OC7PO|5.0|Amusing, witty, informative, reflective; it's just a typical Bill Bryson book.  The guy writes such great stories you can't help but enjoy them!
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|This is one of the best westerns ever made.  Each of the characters in this western are just like you would have seen then in real time.  They are dirty, lacking in any sort of caring about other people but them selves.  As it was so very often in the real South West life had so little meaning.  This movie let's you see all of that for real.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Read before as a child, now re-read many, many years later.<br /><br />The story of pirates, hidden treasure, the high seas and sailing with the wind have lost none of their attraction after a 50 year gap.  It is a great tale, well told, exciting, possibly rather violent by today's children's book standards - people actually get killed.  Relive your childhood, read it to your kids/grandkids (it will improve their vocabularies no end) and just enjoy it for what it is - a children's tale of adventure and derring-do.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the Piano Guys!! They are so inspirational. The music makes me want to learn how to play the piano or cello. (So if you guys are teaching let me know!) My favorite song is Peponi. Love that they brought in a different culture into this song. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. This is by far my favorite app. I love all of the different categories to choose from and look through. I have gotten so many great recipes from the food and beverage section. LOVE PINTEREST.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Really was looking forward to this one as I have always been a fan of the Aliens series.  I must say that the packaging is very nice and the extras are a great plus.  Though I must admit I really and mostly interested in the footage from the 1st 2 movies.
B003UBTX72|3.0|Denial. It was informative in that I never knew about the economics and logistics of being a Rolling Stone. I am not sure the story was truthful.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Excellent movie for fans of action flicks. It does not disappoint in any way. The actors are perfectly matched to the Marvel characters.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Must have album for any collection!!! The wonderful interpretations and reworking of some of the most loved and known songs is phenomenal. HIGHLY recommended to EVERYONE!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These \\"guys\\" are masterful musicians with a creative joyful approach to great music.  We have their first CD and it is almost worn out - can't wait to get my hands and ears on this one.  Follow them on Facebook or look them up on YouTube - you'll be hooked![[ASIN:B009EAO38C The Piano Guys]]
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Kept your interest, good basic novel with lots of interesting twists and turns. Of course I'm a Connelly fan. Not his best but not bad either.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I am very pleased with this game. Yes the cost is more than your average hidden object games but is well worth it. Graphics are amazing and the storyline is very good. Story moves along well and is challenging .  I would highly recommend it with two thumbs up!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A lot of pages of not much except boring prose until the end when it all pulls together. Basically I was bored with most of the book until the end when it got exciting.
1451648537|5.0|Outstanding biography of a creative genius who was presented honestly...warts and all.  The writer made you feel as if you had personally known Jobs and, in spite of the length (600+ pages), it never seemed &#34;too long&#34;.  I could definitely re-read this book again sometime!  I highly recommend it.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The original series with improved digital effects.  The episodes still hold up after all these years.  Great extra stuff as well.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  My kids liked it too..lol..I would reccommed for anyone that has a little girl in the home.
B001FRNOFU|5.0|What a perfect way to bring me into the spirit of the winter holidays!  Ms. McKennitt is, as ever, enchanting and inspiring.  A magnificent cd and the bonus dvd is a real treat.  Highly recommended for any fan of this amazing woman.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love wordless music, but sometimes, I don't feel like listening to the classics and usually the up beat music is too much, when I am in the mood for the wordless music. This is a perfect mix of both styles. I love all the songs on this CD, though I might love their music videos even better! :D
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absolutely love this cd of their music. There is something for everyone! I hope they release another cd soon.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Some of my favorite music ever, and my whole family never gets tired of it.  Whenever we want to pick up our mood, we turn on The Piano Guys.  Love it ALL.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I love how this book started. It was just all sorts of intellectual jokes not comical in the &#34;hahah&#34; sense but more so in the make you smile kind of way. The set up for how Conner and Meagan  even met was cute Jodie and Tina were a mess. The way that Conner protected Meagan at the wedding was such a cute thing. Now the all the things that Meagan is doing to get Conner to change his mind were annoying. With all the antics she pulled she should of just walked away from him versus doing/creating all these little things to get him walk away. But overall the book was a nice read and worth the time it took to read it. <br /><br />Sent from my iPad2
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Very entertaining and very gifted people.  Everything that they do is wonderful.  Keep up the good work!  Look forward to your next video!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This made a wonderful gift for an eagles lover. The music and video are great. I've seen it several times and highly recommend it.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I have allways liked movies like this. Iron man 2  is just another great movie. I love tony stark in this one, you see a more human side in him
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Woooooow....... Bad controls and graphics. Well ok graphics. But really?????? A time limit???? What STUPID developer puts a TIME LIMIT on there game???? Don't get the app because it waste space. :S
B009B50QOU|5.0|I was soo exited to here that green day was still making new cds and I could not waite to get this one. and it did not disapoint me. I love it so much.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|What amazing talent! I love every song! This CD is a must buy! You will be happy you bought it! Love how they use the piano and cello together!
B00A12VW86|5.0|Just the second in the trillagy but it is as good as Uno. I love it as well. I have been a green day fan since the begining and I fell in love with them all over again.
B0047C2IIE|5.0|What can you say except it is Bing Crosby - singing classic Christmas songs.  It is exactly what I want during the holiday season.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|just like spider man, batman and Iron man I loved this one as well.. It was cool to watch it over again and see some small stuff that I missed watching it for the first time
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I bought this DVD in 2004 and fell in love with it! I watch it several times every year and it never fails to make me feel good about everybody!I also have the Sound Track CD which I play quite a bit...great music and the best verion of \\"White Christmas\\" ever by Otis Redding!(Bing Crosby would have loved this version!)<br /><br />The cast is fantastic especially if you love British cinema like I do. I'm a big fan of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and the rest of the cast. Buy it and enjoy it!!!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A story about about one of less known Queens, with a bit of romance thrown in. Very charming and well told.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I loved the Firefly series and wish it had never been cancelled.  Serenity ties up some loose ends.  The cast has great chemistry.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|My entire family sat down to watch this movie. I didn't know anything about this writer until I watched this movie---very charming.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I just listened to it once, so maybe I have not given it a chance. It just isn't the sound I expected from this artist. It has more of a country music type genre which is not my favorite. I really love this artist, have seen her in person in Italy, but this CD did not please me.
B0091XRL86|4.0|The Claymation studios at its best. Wallace and Gromit the first movie that I saw was a hillarious romp between a man and his dog. The Pirates Band Of Misfits continued the romp that was established in the W and G movie. Welcome Back Claymation Studios.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It brought me back to a time when I was a kid playing the original Oregon trail. I like the game a lot, except for a few glitches.  But still worth getting
B009LRE040|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises vs The Avengers movie. My rating of five stars is indefference of the many one star ratings that other consumers (or haters) of DC. I have viewed a few one star movies such as Die Darkman Die and I find it hard to believe that DKR would rate a one star from anyone. Considering each movie in The Dark Knight Trilogy on its own merit I would  give a Three and a half for Batman Begins, a solid Four and a half for The Dark Knight due inpart for the strong acting perfomance by Heath Ledger as The Joker. The Dark Knight Rises concluded the the trilogy with what I believe to be the best of the three due to its storytelling. After The Dark Knight movie I thought  how can the next movie top this one. I'm not sure yet whether it did or not but it was a solid and fast moving story that did not seem to be two hours and forty five minutes in length. The movie was engaging and held my attention through out. As for the Avengers movie it dragged along as Marvel created a scenario for each of the Avengers. For the record I like Marvel just DC a little more.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I won't go over the plot - you can read other reviews for that.  I loved this movie visually and from a storytelling standpoint.  Some would say there are plot holes - no.  It's the kind of storytelling which makes you think rather than spoon feeding you everything.
1449408656|5.0|Cat Versus Human - I love Yasmine Surovec, her cats are just like mine, so is her adoring attitude towards them x x x
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The soundtrack and graphics for this game are superbly done. They blend to create a macabre aura... so much so that at one point I was so startled by a character that I gasped out loud! Apart from the suitably dark ambience, the game play is engaging and mostly intuitive. There are hidden object puzzles and a few other types of puzzles. When you're stuck, there are hints and a map displays where you can go within the town to complete other challenges. The amount of content was just right with game play taking about a week of casual play. All of Big Fish's games look fantastic, but the sinister undertones to the plot are what drew me to this one and it did not disappoint!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It was easy to learn w/o reading the rules, but a little slow.  loved the graphics better than the game on Nextbook.
0446572993|5.0|I await anxiously to pick up  each new book that David Baldacci writes. His plots are exciting and engaging.  To date I have read all but one or two of his books. His suspense stories are so captivating that  I have a hard time putting them down until I have finished each book.  Anyone who enjoys a good murder and/or suspense book  with a bit of political flavor would enjoy  &#34;The Innocent.&#34;.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I expect that this movie would be irritating to anyone with [at least] half a brain in their head. The character development and the plot were pathetic and the special effects were anything but special.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|A good read but not as sit-on-the-edge -of-your-seat read as THE LION.  Again its all terrorist focussed.  Would recommend it though.
B009GEOLM4|1.0|This animated feature is well-animated but the dialogue is complete crap! I could only stand to watch the first ten minutes before turning it off.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Some may ask why, others may not even consider it, but I personally thought the picture was exciting. Yes, the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing, so much so that he is not only capable of avoiding a parodic representation of Lincoln but ultimately capturing the nuances of our 16th President at the same time in a creative fashion. If you thought that \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Munich\\" were too concerned with carnage and not enough with character, you needn't have such a fear going in to see \\"Lincoln.\\" I admit that the timing of the picture was a bit odd, but why not? The moral of the story is that Spielberg is working against his more sensational instincts and trying very hard to make a film that will not entertain so much as it will inspire memories and spark discussions. I applaud Spielberg for NOT trying too hard to keep the audience's attention; after all, how dumb would it have been to simply make another war movie filled with bloody violence? Haven't we seen enough of that already? No, \\"Lincoln\\" is the deeper film, with Spielberg in mature mode, handling the subtleties of characterization splendidly. \\"Lincoln\\" is a moderately subjective character portrait and some kind of masterpiece, giving the more sensitive viewers among us the opportunity to watch actors really act and listen to characters as they engage in dialogue rather than physical violence. Quite a good film indeed. And, for what it's worth, I think Lincoln himself would have had the good sense of humor to have approved of this picture (I realize I'm pulling the man and his times out of context, but still...).
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|The music was less rock and more folk.  A little too folksie for my taste.  I also found the lyrics a little dark and depressing.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|rapido y seguro el servicio me gusto el producto porque era justo lo que vi es justo lo que me llego
B006IYG5HE|5.0|As always, Jo Nesbo doesn't disappoint.  Harry Hole dispite all his problems, comes through again with the answer.  Good story development and it kept me guessing until the end.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|rapido y seguro el servicio me gusto el producto porque era justo lo que vi es justo lo que me llego
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The music of the Piano Guys is so much more than simply notes on a page.  They combine old and new ideas to create music that awakens the soul.  Listeners can feel the passion and love each member pours into every piece.
B00023B1LC|5.0|rapido y seguro el servicio me gusto el producto porque era justo lo que vi es justo lo que me llego
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The music is amazing!  I love the photography, too.  The Piano Guys are a very class act!  What a great Christmas gift this would make!
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Emma is one of my favorite English period piece films! Gwyneth Paltrow is sublime as the only American in a cast of Brits. I watch this movie over and over again - with romance, intrigue, humor and great filmmaking, Emma is definitely a 5 star.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't normally read reviews prior to reading a book, because so often the plot is given away. I enjoy the magic of my own discovery.  However, wish I had on this one.  As other reviewers have noted, the first 3/4 of the book is well written and the story well told.  The last quarter left me trying to hard to determine who was the protagonist here, perhaps there isn't one.  The end of the story left me feeling down, bare<br /><br />My other issue with is book the foul language on nearly every page.  Just too much for me.  In my reality, I don't know people who speak that way all the time, hardly know people who speak like that any of the time.<br /><br />This book may be enjoyed by some, but not by those of us who tend to be more traditional and who are looking for a stimulating read.  The author has potential, if she would clean up her act and create better endings.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This a wonderful remake of the classic movie! With themes of hope, kindness and the courage to take a risk, this Christmas movie is a must add to your library.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|We were so excited to see an album by the Piano Guys because we love their videos! This is a great mix of music that parents and children will both enjoy.
B005XLN97M|4.0|If you are looking to find a nice house for your child's Barbies and are not willing to spend $100 (or more) this is the house for you.  My daughter absolutely loves it, she plays with it daily.  I only took off one star because its not very &#34;mobile&#34; in that every time we pick it up to move it, which is almost every day, it comes apart and we have to put it back together.  Its small enough that its not really a big deal since its a quick fix, but its irritating enough to lose a star!
1589795474|4.0|As expected.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The original Rocky is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time.  The rest that followed were also enjoyable, though not quite as wonderful as the first and second.  I think the transfer to Blu did lose a bit, but certainly not enough to effect my enjoyment of these movies.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I couldn't put this one down!  Great job Vince.  Storyline was interesting with many twists and turns along the way.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have never heard of this book before and my friend and I went to see the midnight premere of the movie. After watching the movie I had to read the book. Not only was the movie beautiful but the book itself was amazing. It was wonderful and brillant a great story from start to finish. In fact I bought this book for people in my family and friends that have not read it.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|It was a boring movie I was disappointed I would not tell my friends or family to watch this movie
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|The worst clock alarm app ever , it's a fake app to get your money, I wish I could give negative 3 stars
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is DEFINITELY a good time-waster! Very addicting and great for all ages!! If you own ANY mobile device, you have to have this app!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille is one of my favorite authors because he weaves a strong story with enough action to keep you on edge most of the book. This one is no exception, John Corey doe not pussyfoot around, especially with a panther. By the time I completed the book, I had left 3 messages for my travel agent to set up a 3 week holiday in Yemen! Lots of local color and activities to be had, and most of the local residents are found to be very engaging.<br /><br />The humor that John Correy presents is always entertaining. In all of DeMille's prior John Corey books, his editor kept him under control. That is, he was moderate with his acerbic wit and inane retorts. In Yemen and in New York, I found the banter in his head to be overwhelming. When I read the acknowledgements, I saw he had a new editor and it became clear he was the problem. Too much of a good thing: humor. I think about 75 pages too much wit.<br /><br />The story line was one of the best among his many good books. I recommend it to others. I found that I got squeamish in some situations and that was a first for DeMille & me. I was shocked and awed a couple of times, too, so that too was good. If you work for &#34;The Company&#34;, I would pass on this selection because you will get angry. Also, if you are a member of al Qaeda, you are not placed in pleasant light, although the Beduin seem like my kind of people.<br /><br />Kate Mayfield needs to ply John with more love before his next novel. He has become too calloused. Have yourself a good quick read.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After seeing the movie Lincoln my husband and I both knew we needed to read this book.  We have lived in the areas of Illinois refered to in the early part of the book and consider ourselves fairly knowledgeable about this great American.  We believe it should be required reading for present day politicians who seem to have no understading of the meaning of cooperation in governance.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great book from a unknown author.  I read just about any type of book.  I just want quality and originality.  This delivers in many ways.  Great plot (although the first mini book leaves you scratching your head), great writing and best yet original story.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I have bought this numerous times for the grandchildren (and me). I bought the most recent one to give to the memory care center, where my husband now lives. No dialog for them to try to hear, and a lovely gentle story.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|If you want a book full of spoilers, then this is it, one of Vonnegut's best. I know. I've read it 3 times in my life already, like his Slaughterhouse Five(five times). I'm going to give away any more spoilers, except to say that life can't get more weird and real at the same time. Plus V has a great sense of humor. Enjoy!
B009EP3C34|4.0|Kesha is a pop artist that you either (1) love or (2) love to hate given her shocking crudeness and overt, unapologetic approach. Sure it is for shock value and sales, but it is a divisive as Kesha's huge personality. 2010 debut  [[ASIN:B002XNEII2 Animal]] was lifted by no. 1 hit \\"Tik Tok,\\" characterized by it's memorable line \\"Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy.\\" The album itself was average,  drug down by too much of the same vein of techno-infused dance-pop.  Those who partook of her [[ASIN:B0046M14RG Cannibal]] EP saw more 'range' of abilities of Kesha and ultimately better songs the likes of \\"We R Who We R,\\" \\"Blow\\" and personal trashy favorite, \\"Sleazy.\\" 2012's [[ASIN:B00A9933OW Warrior]] balances Kesha essentially, allowing her to rein in herself as well as be herself.  Sometimes she chooses to be more traditional while at others she just lets it 'all hang out.'  Warrior ends up being a solid pop album, surprisingly.  There are no outright misses and the bright spots shine, well brightly.  And more impressive, there are times where Kesha shows she can transcend gimmicky vocal processing (\\"Wonderland\\")... shocker right?<br /><br />\\"Warrior\\" opens the album featuring solid production work from Dr. Luke & Cirkut.  As expected, Kesha balances rapping and singing, doing both satisfactorily.  \\"Warrior\\" isn't too shabby - albeit gimmicky and somewhat clunky, though it does ultimately feels as if it is missing something. The chorus keeps things together: \\"We were born to break the doors down, fighting till the end/it's something that's inside of us, it's how we've always been/warrior, warrior...\\"<br /><br />\\"Die Young\\" easily waves off skepticism, giving Kesha a solid pop moment that eschews her profaner nature for the most part. Half-rapped and half-sung verses are intact, crowned by a jubilant chorus: \\"I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums, oh what a shame that you came here with someone...\\" Analogous to \\"Tik Tok\\" in breadth, \\"Die Young\\" is unsurprisingly a smash.  \\"C'mon\\"  is arguably better, keeping a similar pop-rap format and hitting hard on a gargantuan chorus. Catchy and feisty (\\"I don't wanna go to sleep, I wanna stay up all night...\\"), Kesha's youthful rebelliousness bodes well on \\"C'mon.\\"<br /><br />\\"Thinking Of You\\" is solid, if archetypical - particularly Dr. Luke/Benny Blanco/Cirkut's harmonic scheme.  Regardless, the groove is addictive. On \\"Crazy Kids,\\" Kesha talks more overt, profane trash.  While this is how the pop star has come to be characterized, it may be her less vulgar moments that bode best on Warrior.  \\"Wherever You Are\\" atones for any improprieties, sporting an 80s sensibility reminiscent of new wave. The songwriting structure is solid, sporting verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format.  Pleasant and commercial, Kesha shines sans profanity.<br /><br />But Kesha is a balancing act herself, so a little grime with the help of Iggy Pop on \\"Dirty Love\\" doesn't hurt.  The tempo is quick and Kesha is at her most manic (\\"Oh whoa, I just want your dirty love...all I need is to get in between your sheets...\\").  Iggy Pop gets in on the action on the second verse, fitting right in \\"Cockroaches do it in garbage cans, rug merchants do it in Afghanistan...\\" Risqu&eacute;, \\"Dirty Love\\" is a fascinating listen.<br /><br />\\"Wonderland\\" contrasts \\"Dirty Love\\" by slowing down the tempo and giving Kesha a mid-tempo cut. Kesha sounds incredibly smooth, an adjective you wouldn't normally associate with the 'rough-and-tumble' pop star.  She deviates from it on another solid cut, the quick-paced \\"Only Wanna Dance With You,\\" showing some punk-pop sensibility on the whiny chorus.  The trio of \\"Dirty Love,\\" \\"Wonderland,\\" and \\"Only Wanna Dance WIth You\\" contrasts and shows different facets of Kesha.<br /><br />\\"Supernatural\\" seems more standard Kesha fare, not unlike 10's Animal.  Dr. Luke/Cirkut pound the drums and electronic sounds while Kesha is on 'autopilot': \\"Baby when we're touching in the dark can you feel it? I can hear the pounding of my heart can you feel it?\\" On penultimate cut \\"All That Matters (The Beautiful Life),\\" Kesha is supported by the dark, driving synths cultivated by Max Martin and Shellback.  Catchy, archetypical, and solid, \\"All That Matters\\" does find Kesha issuing pointless cussing that seems more 'shock value' than notable. Closing cut \\"Love Into The Light\\" finds Greg Kurstin producing and Kesha again opting for the more serious.  The results are half-serious ultimately, as it is hard to take the oft nonchalant pop star seriously: \\"I know I'm not perfect, I know I got issues/I know that I've got a sorted past/and yes some bad tattoos.\\"<br /><br />Overall, as shocking as it is, [[ASIN:B00A9933OW Warrior]] gets the job done for Kesha. It's not the year's best pop album necessarily (Pink and Fun. certainly delivered triumphs), but it delivers plenty of solid and catchy pop. \\"Die Young\\" is one of the brightest moments, but it is not the sole triumph by any means. Kesha will never be for everybody, but she easily appeals to a pop audience who enjoy their 'pop rap,' however much the lyrics are utterly ludicrous. 3 ½ Stars.feel it?

B005LAIHYU|5.0|As a US History teacher, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter gets my full endorsement.  A masterful blend of actual historical documents/journals/people/events with pointed vampire lore to boot.  As a satire, it is marvelous.  As history, it is just plain fun.
B004047XXO|4.0|my kids love it but cannot seem to get the 3d part to work<br /><br />not sure why... do you have to use their glasses (which are really cheap cardboard)?
B000HL09MG|1.0|Is there any way I can get back the last three hours of my life? In the beginning, this movie had promise of being filled with intrigue and mystery with the brushing of the more taboo life of the secret yearning of human sexuality. While I can appreciate the story, it left little to fulfill any of the promises. Unless all you want is to see the naked forms of Kidman and Cruise...I'd suggest either picking up a book or a different movie.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie it is and stuff and the rain comes down an blah seven more words have been acquired now

B008R14YBK|5.0|Bought for a x-mas gift for an 9 year old.  Hopefully it is everything she wanted.  Easy to find, buy, and don't have to wait in line.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Switched from the Speck CandyShell to this case as the plastic started cracking on the previous.  Overall I’m very satisfied.  The only complaint I have is that there is a bit of raised flash on some of the corners, but this is not worth a full point deduction (maybe 1/2 point).  My brother and sister-in-law also have this case neither of which have any complaints.  I prefer the TPU material (which I used for my previous 3GS) over the silicon or hard plastic.  The case itself is pretty thin and doesn't add a ton of bulk to the phone like most cases.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is the best non musical Disney film to date.  I especially like the way it depicts Celtic culture; clearly Disney has finally learned something from its Pocahontas and Mulan cultural debacles!  Merida is the perfect heroine.  But more importantly, this film touches upon the most difficult relationship of all:  mothers and daughters!  It's a film so universal to our experiences as girls and women that it is an absolute must-see for mothers and daughters alike!<br /><br />The soundtrack here is fabulous!  Please download the album.  it's absolutely beautiful music, especially \\"Noble Maiden Fair\\" which is sung by Emma Thompson in Gaelic and features haunting Irish harps!
B00136NUG6|5.0|This was a great buy and the songs are all excellent if you like this type of music!  Just fun to listen to!
B004UPANAI|3.0|I love the X-Men series.  With stars such as Sir Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen, Hallie Berry, and Hugh Jackman, the franchise is terrific, one that I really enjoy watching the movies over and over again on DVD.<br /><br />Of the five X-Men films to date, however, I confess I enjoyed this film the least for its sometimes excessive violence, particularly by Wolverine's older brother, Sabertooth.  Hugh Jackman is brilliant -- as you expect -- but the writing is just not quite as solid as it is with the original trilogy nor with X-Men First Class.  It's simply just a bit too much of a violent blockbuster and not quite enough heart to it.  I was especially disappointed in the treatment of Scott Summers (Cyclops) as Cyclops has always been one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />There was also a continuity goof with the film with regards to the very brief appearance of Professor Charles Xavier who is shown STANDING on his own two legs, even though his scene is set fairly close to the present -- long after Xavier was paralyzed.  While this could be explained by his appearance being a psychic illusion (which Xavier is readily capable of), the X-Men franchise has typically done a very good job at making the distinction between reality and what Professor Xavier projects telepathically.  Without such a flash to reality, his appearance makes very little sense.<br /><br />Probably the best part of this film comes through the appearance and use of Gambit (Remy LeBeau) who in many ways steals the show.  In a film largely absent of fan favorite mutants, Gambit is the one face those of us who have seen the other films (and animated series before that) can relate to.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|good work, clear writing, great story. grisham is one of the best authors around. i can see why he is so popular.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|As a family we LOVE the piano guys. We were first intoduced to them via Facebook and I had no clue who they were and then I watched their first video and I was hooked. Then their Star Wars video was released and my son was hooked. As a whole we listen and watch every video and song we can of the PianoGuys. They are amazing. Our own hometown boys are making big and we cannot be more proud. They do everything from classical to pop and back again. If you get a chance check them out on YouTube and you to will be hooked on them!Then buy this CD because it will become a cult favorite in your home too![[ASIN:B009EAO38C The Piano Guys]]
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Cutting for Stone was the best book that I have read in a long time. The novel Room was another prize winner for me. The Racketeer was not the author's best but improved as I kept reading
B005IQ39AY|5.0|There are MANY Bubble Shooter games available & I believe I've played all of them. Bubble Touch, however, is different than all of those that have come before it!<br /><br />Although it DOES have the same basic appearance of a classic game of Bubble Shooter and it DOES have the same basic rules for playing the game, the developers at Deemdyda M.S. Ltd. have reinvented this Classic by making just a few minor changes!<br /><br />First thing I'd noticed were the high definition graphics. On my Kindle Fire HD, they're simply OUSTANDING! It was like Eye Candy! I couldn't wait to begin playing so I could see more! The graphics used for the games bright colorful balls made them appear as though they were real. They reminded me of the shiny glass ornaments we would hang on our Christmas tree every year. And, then there are the colors....The colors used for these balls are different & unique in comparison to your other bubble shooter apps, as well. It was difficult for me to stop playing & write this review because I was hooked as my curiosity grew with each new level; wondering,: ' I wonder what new colors will be used this time?'<br /><br />The sound effects, some may find annoying after they've been playing for a spell. Personally, I didn't mind them at all. As long as the volume is kept at a certain level, I feel it only added to the excitement of the game. I especially like the sound effects the balls make in the Classic Mode when you take out a large group of balls. On my Kindle Fire HD, the sound is very similar to rapid gunfire. Very Cool!<br /><br />The 'Chainsaw' ball is a tool that can be used to remove nearly the entire board sometimes! This is a new concept you won't find in other shooter games & I love it!<br /><br />If you enjoy Bubble Shooter games then you'll definitely enjoy this one! As the FAOTD,I recommend you grab it now! If you were not able to get it when Amazon had offered it for free, I still feel it's worth every penny of the asking price.<br /><br />**On a side note: I've downloaded Bubble Touch to my 1st Edition Kindle Fire, as well as my Samsung Galaxy. I was pleased to see that the graphics are not in HD (high definition) but, they're still just as stunning none the less!/>**On a side note: I've downloaded Bubble Touch to my 1st Edition Kindle Fire, as well as my Samsung Galaxy.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am excited that everyone in my family loves ThePianoGuys Music.  We watch the videos and listen to their music over and over and it is great every time.  I think this music is timeless and unifies all generations.  It is nice to have something to listen to for a change that is uplifting and not depressing!  It has inspired me to do better with my own art and to work harder to create something great!  I have purchased all of their songs because they are all fantastic!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|A really fun movie if you want to laugh and turn red! The plot is so, so, but who the heck is watching men strip for anything other than to laugh and have a good time!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A fantastic blend of classical and pop music. If you are looking for a way to introduce your children to classical music, this is it.  My kids love it as much as I do!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|love it was awesome. lovbvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeddddddddd it so much I hope u love it just as much as I do. became a really flood app
1439127700|4.0|No matter what your political orientation, this book is an eye-opener, interesting, and well-written.  I learned quite a lot of new information about various political decisions made by individual Presidents as well as about the professional and personal relationships forged by ex-Presidents based on their &#34;exclusive&#34; club.  I was pleasantly surprised, because my initial thoughts were that the book would probably be boring.  It was not.  I enjoyed reading it and have now passed it on to my father who will no doubt enjoy it as much as I did.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is an outstanding album!  What this group does with a piano and a cello in bringing classical and contemporary music together is wonderful!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I was enjoying this game until it crashed.  It was also very difficult to find my facebook friends to challenge.
B004BLTNM0|4.0|A New York woman (where I am from), goes to the country (where I live now) to start working on her book (what I am also doing). Only to be brutally raped and beaten by 5 different men savagly (what I hope never happens). Thats when she gets her big payback. One by one she gets them back different ways like they all deserve it. Men for some reason don't like this movie.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|love the soundtrack and the story is quite sweet. recommended for anyone tired of recycled storylines and wants something clever and entertaining!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series gets better Nd better. Can't wait to see what book number 3 has in store! Down with the capitol!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book provides closure on the main characters as it relates to the missing puzzle in Christian's childhood while in foster care.  Also, their experience confirms that your unresolved past greatly impacts your present and it takes a willingness to discuss, heal and grow into your future.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I watched the entire first season, but found it difficult to watch as it is basically a soft porn made for Prime Time with disturbing sexual situations. That just isn't &#34;entertainment&#34; in my book. Now zombies, on the other hand....
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I love these books and this is yet another riveting read.  The only drawback was that it had to stop.  I hate getting to the end of a book I love  ;-)
B0045XICB2|1.0|Ok. I'm not a teenager and I'm not so into the goth vampire scene as I might've once been. I DID enjoy the first Twighlight movie. I found it's cinematography to be stunning and gorgeous, and I found the story somewhat interesting.<br /><br />This movie...well, maybe I'm just too old. It was not interesting at all. The beauty of the first movie was lost. And it feels like a simple teenage drama, full of drama queens and angst.<br /><br />Sorry Kiddos. Not the best.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I must say I am shocked at the negative reviews, but to each his own.  I loved this change of pace for Disney and Pixar.  The entire princess thing to me is played out.  Beautiful (perfect looking) girl seeks handsome husband and somehow they meet, fall in love instantly and live in a huge castle with everything they could imagine, etc (oh and they can all sing.)  While nice in a fantasy type world, it is not reality.  How many of our daughters still think this is reality.  They want that fantasy, and as they grow they realize that it is not how the real world is, and truth be told is not reality for many of us.  I loved how this played on the tough relationship between a daughter and her mother (this is real life).  The fact that as the daughter got older she came to understand she did not want the same thing her parents wanted is reality, many of us lived this.  The daughter tried to change this on her owm, makes a bad decision, but in the end they work things out as a family.  It is called growing up, coming to terms with your parents dreams to make you happy and your own.  The witch and magic aspect - if you don't approve of this in a movie for your kid, I can respect that.  It is just par for the course since Harry Potter, the Twilight movies, the list goes on and on.  If you feel that strongly - don't go to Disney World, it is filled with Magic inspire rides and shows.  My daughter loved it, she was Merida for Halloween - she loved the strong \\"Brave\\" aspect.  A girl who is able to be tough, hold her own among the \\"men\\" and still a pretty girl.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I've watched NCIS since the beginning. It's witty and interesting, as far as crime dramas go. I'm not sure what the magic ingredient is, but I'm still Hooke after all these years:)
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to say I did not like this book. It was very slow to start, there were no appealing characters and the ending was flat. there were some interesting moments in the middle. I felt like the author ran out of material and just ended it with&#34; I have the last word.&#34;
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Not anywhere close to meeting my expectations of this movie! The storyline had no real meat on it's bones and the characters fell flat. The special effects were ok.<br /><br />I feel like this movie could've been condensed into the 1st quarter of the NEXT movie opposed to being stretched out into a full length feature film.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|We had very high expectations for this movie and were left slightly disappointing. However it was still good, just not as amazing as it could have been.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love me some zombies! The Walking Dead is one of my favorites, but this season is starting to get goofy and is beginning to turn into every other show. By that, I mean the conflict inevitably turns into a war of tribes and the unique piece of the storyline (zombies) becomes a faded backseat passenger.
B007R41E8O|5.0|good game really enjoyed it can't wait to play the next one I would like a bit more horror and mystery.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I can't get enough of this show! It's intelligent, beautifully cinematic and is true to the time period in which it takes place. The storyline is intricate and superbly crafted, leaving me wondering what will happen next.
B000002MK8|5.0|I love it especially when he brings Ronnie Wood in on guitar. I was first given this album in 1993 when it was on a tape and I wore it out. I particularly love &#34;Handbags & Gladrags&#34; & &#34;Mandolin wind&#34;. In my opinion Rod Stewart is a fantastic entertainer and can any type of music and is shown in the success of Great American Songbook album. I love him
B000002ORL|5.0|I had left my two CDs at a friend's home and never got them back.  Apparently, she loved the music.  However, I would not recommend this music unless someone asked me about it specifically, because many people object to the rock 'n roll format.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|You just have to love anything Nora Jones does. This album is pretty much what you would expect from her.
1451695195|5.0|As always, the service from the vendor was marvelous!  I heard Dr. Alexander speak on NPR and immediately went online to order the book.  He is very convincing and his experience has a lot in common with others who have had a near death experience.  He even included a few experiences that I haven't heard of.  I'm very glad I bought this book.
B009JBZH54|3.0|I would've given this 2 1/2 stars if I could.  First off, the Batman Begins disc did not have any bonus features on it even though it was advertised as having them. Second, all of these movies are &#34;letterbox&#34; versions with the bars at the top and bottom of the screen. On TDK, the aspect ratio bounces back from the IMAX ratio to the letterbox ratio which gets annoying. Last, there are no menu options on any of the movie discs. This means if you want to stop the disc temporarily, your player will not be able to resume where you left off. I thought maybe it was my player but it did the same thing on a friends Blu-ray player too. Fast forwarding gets really annoying. I pre-ordered this item from amazon for under $30 when it was released. That was a really good deal if you want basic versions of the trilogy. I wouldn't pay the new price of $40. I'd stick with buying them individually for now until Warner Bros. releases a Deluxe version next year.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the viewpoint of both parties. Very enjoyable read. I liked and disliked each character. Great discriptions of all characters, from their looks to mannerisms.
0345479092|3.0|I bought this book because I wanted some fresh input on some issues I was having with my baby (not sleeping through the night, being one of them). First of all, the quality of the actual paperback was terrible--the tops of the pages looked like they had been torn off. Anyway, the book was entertaining, with lots of stories of the couples she helped and some funny British humor mixed in. I found it a little weird how she spent quite awhile writing about how we need to respect our babies, call them by their names, give them a tour of the house, tell them what we are doing to them (&#34;Now, I'm going to change you diaper since you are dirty.&#34;) Her chapter on feeding your baby shocked me, in that she did not push breastfeeding over formula feeding. She seemed to treat them equally. Her E.A.S.Y. plan for a schedule for your baby made a lot of sense to me, although I had been doing that already on the advice of another book (just not using that acronym!). She did not give a lot of details to timelines or what to do when situations change and the scheduled can't be followed correctly. The chapter on &#34;Accidental Parenting&#34; boasts that in 3 days we will be able to change the bad habits we have allowed our babies to get into. However, she shares one long story about a family with a terrible sleeper and what she did to help them, then does not go into much detail after that on the issue. It didn't help me much at all. I guess I was hoping for some clearer direction. The part that down right annoyed me was how she spent several pages describing the way to go about hiring the ideal nanny. She could have better used those pages to give more practical advice on sleeping issues (isn't that what most of us need help on, anyway!?).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was nice.<br />I read and read nd read some more.<br />If you have always had a fantasy of acting out any of the things in this book...then its a mist read.
B002ZG983M|5.0|This is such a great movie! I saw it in theatres and knew I had to have it. I can't wait for the sequel!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Book was good and I enjoyed reading it, but  story was more like a fantasy and the ending was predictable.  I would recommend if you want a light read.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|I thought this was an interesting read. There are times when he comes off as a bit smug, but I guess that goes with the territory. It goes as a good counterpoint to books like &#34;The Black Swan&#34;, the two authors seem to have very different views on probability and forecasting.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|love it that its free and so easy to transfer things and keeps my device from filling up  again love it
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Parts of the book are really exciting. Other parts are pretty ridiculous. Worth reading if you're into thriller books and don't mind if they have a somewhat unbelievable plot-line.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been a fan of the piano guys for some time now.  They never disappoint me!  Get this CD you will be amazed at the talent!!!
1856697061|5.0|i loved the first had to have the second and LOVE IT EVEN MORE! excellent book! love love looove it
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game :) It is easy and fast with the double tapping of the cards and challenging as well. Highly recommend. Enjoy!
B004L03B3S|5.0|Never brack a relationship when u are in love with someone special in you life.  It doesn't matter who it it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|JUST A REALLY EXCITING MOVIE, NOT A LOVER OF BATMAN, BUT THIS MOVIE RATES HIGH ON MY LIST. NON-ENDING EXCITEMENT.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've seen The Piano Guys in concert twice--and they're amazing. Every single one of their songs is a masterpiece. I was actually just telling my husband the other day that The Piano Guys convinced me that instrumental music doesn't have to be boring.<br /><br />The only thing wrong with this album is that one of my favorites, \\"Bring Him Home,\\" isn't on it.
034580404X|1.0|I was thinking of getting this set for my Kindle BUT $27.75 for a set of PAPERBACKS (and all the costs to produce them) and $29.95 for a simple KINDLE DOWNLOAD (minimal cost)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The GREED and ARROGANCE of these publishers seem to get worse and worse and they will keep pricing like this until people stand up to them. RIDICULOUS!!! Would have been zero stars but it wouldn't let me.
0553583182|3.0|Its a good read and has alot of great ideas. I was never able to master any of them though. I did try real hard, even read the book 3 times or more on some chapters. I was never fully able to manifest my dreams.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you liked Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, get set to enter<br />a world even more engaging! George R. R. Martin has set us upon a journey following<br />the House Stark of Winterfell and their quest of peace for their family in a land<br />where it is denied them at every turn. I don't know when I've ever read a book as<br />captivating as this one is. This is the first volume of four (the second, due in the<br />summer of '97) and as much as I wish all were available right now, the time lag here<br />will give me time to re-read A Game of Thrones another time or two before the<br />second is released. If you like to get so wrapped up in a book that you can't wait to<br />get back home to read some more, this is the one you need to get into. Every time<br />you think you've figured out what the next turn of fate will bring the members of the<br />Stark family, George Martin snatches the rug out from under you as you pour into the<br />next chapter. This is the finest writing I've found in the last two decades!
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I'm kind of biased here. I love the show do unless something was wrong with the disks then this will get five stars!
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I didn't read Book One, but did watch the entire season that HBO created and found it extremely well done, if not outright impressive. After a few episodes, I was hooked on the story and wanted to see where it would go. Since the HBO series followed Book One so closely, I felt that I could jump right into Book Two, which I did, and I thoroughly enjoyed the 700+ journey. I am not typically a reader of fantasy (or sci-fi, for that matter), but this story has just the right mix of realism and fantasy, without all of the mysticism or magic that accompanies other books of the genre, such that the Game of Thrones series is almost completely believable.<br /><br />Martin has created a whole new world, like unto the world that we know here, but different enough that the reader recognizes its differences while still being able to relate to the characters' overall way of life. Everything about the book is impressive: the characters are deep, rich and complex, the scenery and picture painted for the reader is beautiful, the plot is addicting and the dialogue is skillfully written. There are scores of people passing in and out of Martin's world and it takes some time to keep everyone straight, but they are well developed, realistic, and all truly different. I simply do not understand how Martin sat down and developed the storyline and characters that he has, but like millions of people around the world, I am now one of the beneficiaries of his creativity and hard work. Thank you GRRM
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Been awhile since I've loved an entire cd. Well worth $10.  Packaged well, beautiful photos and no defects. Want more of their music.
0307155102|5.0|My kids had this book in the 70's and I HAD to have it for my grand children too. Wonderful book!
B003L77GH4|5.0|I'm kind of biased here. I love the show do unless something was wrong with the disks then this will get five stars!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I jumped on the fifty shades bandwagon late... as usual. but i can honestly say that i read ALL three books in like 3 days. i could hardly put them down. if you want a love story that grips you from the beginning and isn't fake, this is the one. I was kinda saddend that they aren't going to expand after this novel, but the ending was really good. it is nice to have seen and read as these characters developed, some of the stuff was predictable, but then again i read N.Sparks, and his stuff is pretty predictable too.
B0015346OM|2.0|The author was trying to be more of a journalist rather than conveying the meaning and gravity of the story. Unneeded details of men behaving badly when they are bored and alone does nothing but distract from what our country put them through. At some point in the editorial process they needed to cut out the distractions and focus on the heroism.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I honestly got this after reading the 1st book and couldn't stand going to a store and waiting in line for the last 2... depsite the fact i knew i should have gotten the series from the start. I honestly couldn't put it down, and it took me a day to read.. book 3 here i come.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The authors did a great job of telling a great story. I came away with an admiration for the Seals and everyone who would try to become one. No unnecessary sensationalism, no searching for flaws to &#34;reveal&#34; that heroes aren't that special. Just the essentials of a fascinating story about what can happen when people of talent have the support of their organization to truly do the very best that they can.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love being able to have amazon right at my fingertips.. it is a great app, and there isn't anything i can say that is bad about it. gotta love amazon for doing their magic again.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip Phillips is beyond talented! Such a great album that was worth every penny! I'd highly suggest his album and Amazon Digital Purchasing, it made downloading and sharing this album so easy, and was much more affordable than iTunes and other mp3 buying sites!
B0017O1MIM|5.0|The DVD is fabulous. The book is by Jeremey Arnold is well researched, interesting anecdotes and insights, gorgeous pictures and VDERY well written.
B003H9M1Q2|4.0|As a classic, I got this for my daughter. She loved the songs and the animation. Still a classic in my book!
B009CPES4I|5.0|I'm so glad I ordered this in HD, it was wonderful.  Excellent cast and a fun movie to watch.  I highly recommend this one.
B005LAII12|1.0|This man obviously has something against Asians. Look at all the work he has done, he can't thrive without taking a shot at an Asian person.
4898153194|5.0|There's a true love between cats and their owners that cats are loathe to show to outsiders but yet it is captured in these wonderful photos. Their universe is simple, home and garden, but their connection to it (and each other) is intimate. It will convince even the most hard-core dog lover that cats too can be loving creatures. This book is a true treat for the soul.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great read an  it did leave  me guessing and turn each page.  W  cheer for the underdog triumph again.  Entertaining but not my favorite of his books but not disappointing either hi  formula works for me every time.
B000T433CO|5.0|Great warm story!  It will become one of your DVD's that you'll watch each Holiday season!!<br />Do buy this wonderfully acted movie.
0307592731|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is 'looking for themselves'.  But be prepared -- it'll make you want to go and immediately hike the PCT or tackle something equally as huge.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Good movie and very interesting. But some scenes are not really worth it.  nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn mmmm bnnnnn ggghgh jjjj  jjj j
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I watched the Youtube releases and knew that  I wanted to see the complete movie.  Master Chief is awesome!  Halo 4 is awesome!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Yes, I am also sick of the inundation of Adele songs on the radio.  But you cannot discount that Adele's style is refreshingly new (now often copied), her beat unique, her songs memorable.  Simply briliiant.
B00013M6NK|5.0|My husband and I hike in some remote areas taking pictures of waterfalls and its always good having a spare battery along.  Nothing worse then seeing that perfect shot and finding out your battery is dead.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Overall I really enjoyed the book.  It kept me engaged.  I was going to give it 4 stars and after starting to write the review I changed it to 5 stars.  I iniitally thought the first few chapters took too long to develop, but then realized that maybe it was so well written that what I was feeling was the main characters frustration???  However, it it went on any more I may have lost patience.  I do recommend the book.  Suspense and good surprising ending.
0385535147|2.0|I have all of this authors books but to me, it falls short of his past books. Hope the next one is better.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I brought this just for the camera now I had to buy it an its crazy it takes pics sure but then I cant find them. I guess its a work in progress, I will write when  I have mastered the art.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Best album I've heard in a long time, and only one of the songs has words in it, that says a lot!
B00571F26Y|2.0|Yes, wheat as we know today isn't so great for many people.  I myself do not suffer from gluten intolerance but I do have trouble digesting wheat, especially processed versions.  That said, this is just another diet book written to appeal to a mass audience like so many pop psychology-style books.  I was not impressed.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is better than most near death experience books as it is written by a neurologist who experiences as both a doctor and a participant.  Easy to read, but the take away is still who knows?
B008B4KVS8|5.0|Most people today have no idea of the scope (no pun intended) of the projection system used for films like Ice Station Zebra, called Dimension 150, a very large and curved screen format.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to get it in the heydays of the 70 mm craze, and I can peacefully testify that although this Blu-Ray edition is quite good, the picture itself loses in composition and framing terms, significantly diminishing the impact of the movie presentation.<br /><br />Of course, my personal judgement relies on a hi-def 55&#34; LCD, perhaps those with a front projector and larger screens could appreciate it much better.<br /><br />That aside, ISZ is a typical &#34;cold war&#34; thriller, like so many done during that period, and it is not bad. I am not sure if the genre would appeal to younger audiences but it certainly does to film fans and collectors.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Same basic physics as in original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons, but with much better art and animation, and less overhead, so it runs great even on under-powered devices.  It's a fun game too.  No malicious permissions.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son told me about this game and I was happy to find it as a free download for the Kindle.  I like to do mind exercising games like Sudoku, Majong, etc at night after work to decompress. This game is a refreshing change and it is very simple to get started.  I like the colorful nature of the game and the various levels of challenge.  My 7  year old started at the lower levels and my 13 year old and I jumped to 8X8s pretty quickly.  I have only been playing for a few days, but I believe this app only goes to 9X9 matrices so I'll have to look elsewhere when I get to that level of complexity.  There are only 3 free hints so if you like the hint feature you will have to pay to get more.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is a classicWW2 story film with a awesome story line, powerful and proven cast of actors.  Award winning, excellent music, fine job of film and sound editing--the type of film you want a buddy or your son to watch with you.  If you liked IN HARMS WAY, ENEMY BELOW, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, this film will hit the mark.
B009Z8FUB2|5.0|I rarely &#34;hear&#34; the music while watching a movie. The amazing music of Anna Karenina blew me away. I waited 'till the VERY end, after all the credits so I wouldn't miss even one note of this haunting music. I wasn't positive I'd like the music without the movie, as if often the case, but I'm thrilled I bought this album.
B0092C2X7U|3.0|You have to click on the screen a number of times to make your guy do a backflip. First to bend your legs, then to jump, then to pull your legs into your chest, and then to straighten the legs for the landing. Controls can be a little sluggish at times, but the basics are there. To be honest, I got bored of it quick and hate that I spent a buck fifty on it. I can think of better things to have spent that money on.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I found myself skipping chunks of pages just to see how it ended. Why put so much effort into the first 2 books and just hastily put this together??  It was not very interesting and at times hard to follow.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We are always checking the weather, including the wind speed and direction.  This app gives it all and very complete.  And it's free - bonus!
B0063IH60K|5.0|it's the basic solitaire game with features such as double tap for automatic play. makes it easier on my Kindle Fire
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Great story, great acting, unbelievable settings and costumes.  Surprise ending...the good son becomes king! The bad king is basically exiled--deservedly so.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Very nice MODERN interpretation of how Santa and his elves do it all in one night! Great movie! Fantastic animation. Amazing.
B009JNXK88|5.0|See the detail of the icon of this game? Yeah, that's about the resolution of the game. And, you know what, that is fine. The controls are easy to learn and responsive and the gameplay is pretty smooth... probably because it doesn't need to spend a lot of processing on rendering the game. I played for over an hour and my phone didn't even heat up noticeably like it will during other games.<br /><br />It is a puzzle solving game where you run a guy around, pick up some stuff, and then kick the crap out of the bad guy. If you die, it creates a shadow of what you've done before which is 1) neat and 2) distracting. But you soon learn to turn a blind eye to it. But everything worked without a problem and I found myself enjoying the game immensely. Well worth a buck!
B005LAIHZY|2.0|This film is really more for girls....ginger fire snaps needs a haircut. I have three young boys and they got kind of bored with brave. On the other hand they loved Madagascar 3. Basically its a story of a free spirited and rebellious skinny teenage girl with a massive hairdo who doesn't want her parents to force her into marriage. Her passion is riding her enormous clydesdale horse (Angus) and shooting arrows at stuff... similar to hunger games in that regard, also found it similar to disney's tangled. Worth a rental I guess, I wouldnt buy it... especially at disney's inflated prices. The animation is beautifully done though and it looks really good on BD
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I devoured this in one big gulp. Courtney Milan's books have great characters, complicated emotions, and satisfying resolutions. I enjoyed the hell out of it and cannot wait for the next book.
0307454541|5.0|Loved the American movie, so NEEDED to read the books.  Totally satisfied with the quality of the item and the timely arrival of the book.
B0065AR71E|3.0|I purchased this when Skyrim was first released (pre-ordered both,actually).  The book arrived fine and is a good-looking item.  The information within it is well laid out and helpful.  For the amount of money that was charged for this item, I would expect the book to hold up better.  After a couple of months of use, however, the binding came undone and pages have separated or are separating in several places.  I don't think I've seen other complaints here about this issue with this book, so maybe I just got a bad one.  Be that as it may, I did spend money on this and it would have been nice if my particular copy had lasted without the binding falling apart after only a few months, so I'm subtracting two stars for that reason.  Otherwise, it was a good purchase in terms of the actual content.
B004ODLUGM|1.0|This book is complete nonsense.  Everyone knows there is no such thing as a gruffalo.  We watched this once, and then my kids wanted to watch it again and again and again.
1419705849|2.0|Both my 9-year old son and I agree that this is not Jeff Kinney's best work. The plot didn't seem to go anywhere and the book lacked the LOL or crack a smile moments that all of this other Wimpy Kid books have. The whole introduction was so contrived, it's pages and pages of memories Greg has from when he's an infant. My son loves the Wimpy Kid series and devours each book within a day. We were both disappointed in this one. Maybe it's time to wrap up the Wimpy Kid series, it's had it's run.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Can be challenging and entertaining.  I have it on both my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy Player.  It's a bit hard to do on the Player, but works fine.
B004GYY714|5.0|A friend showed me this application and I will never go back to using anything else!  It works great on Android, Kindle Fire, and your computer (web version).  Sound quality is great and it's not buggy.  Install this one!
030745455X|5.0|Excelent response time to recieve the book.  Excellent Read!  Loved the American movie, NEEDED to read the books!  Totally satisfied.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have enjoyed every video by The Piano Guys and pre-ordered the CD because I couldn't wait to hear it.  It has lived up to my expectations.  Lately, except for Christmas music, it's all I've been listening to.  It's soothing and beautiful to work to, relax to, clean to ... it's good for every occasion. If you like cello and piano, it's a must have CD. I'd like to buy one for everyone I know!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I truly enjoy Columbo. I love watching these with my husband. We enjoys watching them. The product came in the condition presented (New) and I recommend it.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I love the twists and turns.  Prepare to be surprised.  The action is exciting and photography spectacular. Must see movie.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|If you're a fan of Susan Tedeschi and like extended live music where an excellent band jazzes and rocks all over hot bluesy singing, you will enjoy every track of this double CD. There is so much depth in this album's sound and it is always a pleasure to hear classic songs reworked as in Wade In the Water, Stevie Wonder's Uptight, and Everybody's Talkin'. The passionate rendition of Bound for Glory really had me up there dancing in the sky, its sound was so grand. It would be hard to follow the award-winning Revolator, and this two for the price of one is both generous and a steal for the hours of listening enjoyment I have already gotten from it.
0446554995|5.0|Two Graves is RIVETING!! I wanted to devour it all in one read, and yet read tiny little bits of it at a time to slowly savor it!!!  For those that follow the Special Agent Pendergast series, of course you have to read this one!  It ties of all of the loose ends and unanswered questions from the previous books. I find it very hard to put down any Preston & Child book, but this one has you on the edge of your seat!!
B007MAETA8|1.0|I love John Mayer, but I have to say this CD was disappointing. I never finished listening to it. Mistake.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun to play need more,would prefer if there were more in adult type games to limited to children.Great for my kids.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|The movie is somewhat slow paced and raises more questions than it answers about the characters, the academy and what the heck are they doing there in the first place! Way too much time spent on teenage angst, too many scenes with the same message and just when you're getting to know the people, most of them get blown away. (Oops! but I didn't say who!) The action is decent and some creative effects. Too little deus ex Master Chief, of course, but still worth the watch. Hope the next one is better.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys appeal is multi-generational. This album is great because everyone in the family enjoys listening to it. From Grandpa to the youngest toddler and all the ages in between. One daughter used \\"thousand years\\" for her processional music in a recent wedding. Ageless music.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I found these shows one night I couldn't sleep and I just had to have the two seasons. I can't wait for the next one. I watch these all the time.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought the album a few weeks ago. And even if I still almost heard the songs many times on youtube before I am happy to hear the album over and over again. In my opinion Lindsey Stirling created her own very original style of music which stands out from other music.<br />The transport even with shipping was much faster than expected. The album doesn't include any specials but is special itself.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These men never cease to amaze me!  The music is beautiful and their adaptations are very entertaining.  Love watching the videos and seeing the beautiful areas where they film but if you are driving this is perfect music for listening.  The Piano Guys are very talented and will not disappoint!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|There's very few albums with all great songs & this is one of them. They have a nice mix of different songs they do including some well known songs on the radio.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I love this book, if you are ready to make a great comittment to yourself and really stick to it this is for you, if your heart really isn't in it, then wait till your ready.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd get into these books, but I decided to roll the dice and get the bundle.  Definitely the right decision.  I'm so thrilled to be able to go from one book to the next without a wait!
B004132HZS|5.0|I bought both seasons and watch them a lot. I don't sleep a lot and I pop these into my computer and head phones and watch Sherlock and Watson
B00006GFAB|5.0|My and I both love listening to Kiss. They put out a lot of great songs. She will really enjoy this cd.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following The Piano guys for awhile now and I LOVE them.  They are so talented and you can tell they love what they do.  You won't be disappointed in this cd.  I listen to them all the time.  I also love watching their videos on Youtube!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read! I wish it was a forever read like Nora Roberts and her J. D. Robbs series where you always know the characters but they just change up what's going on in their lives.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|One of the Muppets' best productions and a fitting tribute to their departed owner, Jim Henson, and the late puppeteer Richard Hunt. This is a very polished production that glows with respect and admiration for the missing members of the troupe.<br /><br />Jerry Juhl (Henson's head writer since 1963) gives us a pitch-perfect script, keeping the wild humor and the heartfelt moments in equal balance. He also discovers a brand-new, and inspired, pairing of Gonzo and Rizzo.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the widescreen version doesn't have the wonderful song \\"When Love is Gone,\\" which means that fans of this number will never get to see it in widescreen.
B004SBX112|3.0|Unfortunately, this game is getting bad stars due to Amazon failures Not the game application.<br /><br />For the game 4 stars. I love AB Seasons with the constant updates unless you bought from Amazon.<br /><br />For Amazon App Store - 2 stars<br />Waited for Amazon and Developer to get the correct update into Amazon App Store vs. Google Play. Way way to long of a delay. The the update is incorrect deleting all old data and bringing the app back to a long old version. Finally, a correct update is added. I find this unacceptable. One of the reasons I am not buying a Kindle Fire HD. I do not want to be tied down to an App store that is not on top of its game.
8866131350|5.0|I was looking for a soft cover calendar/notebook.  Exactly what I was looking for.  More than I wanted to pay quite frankly, so not sure I would get again - but it really is precisely what I wanted.
B0037FFBCW|1.0|It was returned cause it wasn't in english...It was in English sub-titles. Would not recomend it unless you don't mind reading sub-titles.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absoultly love these piano guys.  Listening to their music makes my day so much brighter.  I love to listen to their stuff right before I take a test (and nursing test are very difficult) because the music calms me down and I am able to focus.  Keep up the good work guys.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once you read one book you have to read all three. Someone at my work had the third book so I did not read it on-line but it made me realize how much I love my kindle. Having the books in my locked Kindle with parental controls allowed me to have the read I wanted without fear of my grandchildren finding it lying aroung. Wish it could be a series.
B004GVUPFE|2.0|I got this as FAOTD,  and am very glad I didn't ' pay for it.  It looked like a neat game with decent permissions,  but when I tried it I discovered the screwy scoring that doesn't allow you to better your score.  And then I discovered that the dev wasn't forthcoming about the access to protected storage - so what else aren't they telling me?  I get distrustful when people deliberately try to mislead.  Uninstalled.

B00932A6G4|4.0|I had read the book by Robert Heinlein and was always uneasy with the live action film adaptation that first came out in the late 1990s. I suspect the writer/director back then wanted to parody Heinlein's novel, and hid this behind a mischievous, theatrical wink. Although this anime sequel adapts story elements from the preceding live action movies, I think it is more closer to Heinlein's work.<br /><br />If the producers do come up with sequels to Invasion, I hope they continue along the same trajectory. There's a lot going for this new retake on the classic tale. The stakes are higher here because the plot line of Invasion make their way to Earth. (In Heinlein's book, Buenos Aires is annihilated by the Arachnids.) It certainly feels more immediate than, say, a fight to retake some far off rock in outer space. The way scenes cut to the trooper's HUD also pay homage to Heinlein's creativity, which was far ahead of its time when the novel came out in the late 1950s. The spirit of the original story lives on in Invasion.<br /><br />It appears the writers of Invasion wanted to shy away from the militarism that was part of the original canon. This is understandable, given the satire adopted by the earlier live action films took. (Kudos to Invasion for *not* including broadcasts from the military boob tube.) That was probably in tune with the sentiments back in the 80s and the 90s.<br /><br />But given the resurgence of military sci-fi in the last dozen years in TV (Battlestar Galactica) as well as video games (Halo), I think the door is open for a sincere rendition of Heinlein's novel. For good or for ill, in much as warfare affects individual lives, it is also a part of our ethos. We don't need satires to trivialize it; in fact, giving it its proper due may help us better explore and grasp the issues underlying war and our military. The themes that Heinlein explored will find a more sympathetic audience these days than before. I hope future sequels will take off alongthese lines.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing! I started listening to them several months back and immediately loved it! They take modern songs and give them a classical makeover. They also have several originals and some soundtracks songs. They are all great songs! I would definitely recommend buying this album. Look for the Piano Guys on Youtube, they post new videos there.
1449410243|3.0|I like the book itself but I bought it for my mom for xmas which is in 3 days with her and the last few pages are all wrinkled up. I hate to still give it to her as it looks used now but dont really have a choice at this point!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album offers a fantastic explosion of the colliding world's of classical music and contemporary pop chart-topping hits. The Piano Guys do an amazing job creating a distinguished sound to recognizable tunes. I love everything they put out.
0743270754|4.0|The characters in this biography are well developed. I enjoyed discovering the path that led the rivals to the Republican party and learning of their relentless support for the abolition of slavery.<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy so much at the beginning was the constant switching back and forth between the backgrounds of Lincoln, Bates, Seward and Chase.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn never disappoints.  I just finished reading this last night...couldn't put it down...and I want to read the next installment in Mitch Rapp's life NOW!

B00A73PSDO|1.0|Bravo for taking something that's supposed to be free (with preorder) and selling it for as much as the movie without even including the movie. Disgusting practices. (From someone who didn't purchase it, but wants to make sure people don't get ripped off)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a read aloud book in school, so i thiught, why not get it to read with the class? And i must admit, in school i wasnt paying attention much, but even then ibliked it. The for christmas, i got this kindle fire hd and like this book jus popped up so i was like, why not read it again? And it was so good!!!!!!!!! Get wonder! Right now! Get it!!!!!!!!!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Interesting first hand account of the extensive preparation and &#34;Take-Down&#34; of this countries #1 enemy! Recommended reading for all adult citizens. Details the many sacrifices made and performance demands required of our military heroes known as &#34;Seal Team 6&#34;!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been following The Piano Guys since before they had thousands of subscribers on YouTube and their music only gets better as time goes on. They stay true to themselves as musicians and I don't go one day without listening to more than 1 song off this album. Absolutely awesome!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This package is great - all three batman movies (the good ones anyway).  In the first movie Nolan recovers Batman from the evil clutches of George Clooney et al.  You get a hero without the cheese.  In the second movie you get one of the greatest portrayals of a villain ever - there's a reason Heath Ledger won an Oscar.  The only complaint I have about \\"The Dark Knight\\" is that it is too long. The final installment is my favorite although I have heard some complaints about the way Bane was portrayed.  Having not read the comics, this was not a problem for me.  The set includes the ultra violet downloads for all three movies.  I would go to Walmart before I ordered in off Amazon though.  It was $10 cheaper.
0439023521|1.0|This book came to be bent and ripped when I was supposed to have gotten brand new.  I should have just went to the nearest bookstore and purchased it or even Walmart.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Every piece of film in this movie is golden. Perfect for any Bob Dylan fan or any music fan in general. I learned a lot!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Well put together cast. They did a great job. Can't wait for the next movie in the series. A must watch.

B007HJ91HU|1.0|This movie doesn't even deserve one star.  It was a train wreck, so bad I couldn't stop watching because I thought it just had to get better at some point. Nope. And boy did they butcher the original in every way possible. I had to immediately watch the original after seeing this version just to get it out of my head. Don't bother with this remake - just watch the original. And if you happen to have seen this and thought it was bad, please watch the original. It truly is a classic.  Come on Hollywood - is their anything original in there anymore? Yikes.
B006O6EOII|4.0|Girls loved them, great price for popular doll. I would defiantly buy more of these again. Two thumbs up. Thanks

B009FBX5M0|4.0|The James Bond films have probably the most expansive and most interesting saga of music there is in the medium. This character has been at the center of public attention for 50 years and so has the music. From Monty Norman's theme that debuted in 1962 to 2012 where we see Thomas Newman join his collaborator Sam Mendes for Skyfall. Most people associate James Bond with John Barry, which is fair since he scored 11 Bond films. But composers like George Martin, Marvin Hamlisch, Bill Conti, Michael Kamen, Eric Serra and David Arnold have also taken their respective turns at scoring the spy. David Arnold became the modern sound of Bond as he has scored the past 5 films. Director Sam Mendes brought his favorite composer along with him and all eyes were on Thomas Newman who was now in charge. Skyfall is by far one of the best modern Bond scores as it embraces James Bond but also embraces what makes Thomas Newman an auteur. A lot of the past composers were trying to write James Bond scores, while Thomas Newman here is writing a Thomas Newman score that happens to be for a James Bond film.<br /><br />We start off with a nod to Monty Norman's world-famous theme and the score is underway. It takes some time to get fully going but in those first few tracks Newman does an excellent job of setting up James Bond's newest adventure. The score then takes on rich and heavy action ride. Thomas Newman does a fantastic job of making sure the James Bond theme is only used when it has been earned, but it's definitely used much more than in David Arnold's last two Bond scores. It's nice to hear that theme become prominent in the score again as sometimes I forgot that I was watching a Bond movie with Casino Royale and Quantum Of Solace. With a running time of 77-minutes this album is packed to the limit with score. There is so much music here and not an ounce of it is boring. Newman delivers action, thrills, suspense and seduction in droves. He embraces certain ethnic sounds to establish settings and locales as well. This is a full-bodied Bond experience that does the films and character extreme justice.<br /><br />When you think \\"Thomas Newman\\" you rarely think \\"pulse-pounding action\\". Well, now you can. Skyfall is a thrill ride from start to finish that injects James Bond with class and vigor that hasn't been seen since Eric Serra composed his much debated score for GoldenEye. The reason why I love Eric Serra's score so much is that he also did not write a Bond score. He wrote an Eric Serra score that happened to be a Bond film. Thomas Newman wrote a Thomas Newman score that happened to be a Bond film. Skyfall is not just a terrific James Bond score, but it's also a terrific action score. It has many genre elements and Newman handles them masterfully. It's refreshing to see an auteur behind the camera and an auteur writing the music. They both worked together to make their James Bond film. Skyfall is one of the great modern Bond scores and it will definitely be remembered for making this 50-year old franchise feel brand new.ttings and locales as well.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Absolutely love the Piano Guys. They have given classical music a new meaning. They have turned many young people to classical music that they never would have been aware of.  They are truly talented.  Be sure to check out their YouTube channel.
B007HACDLK|5.0|You just can't go wrong with any story Vince Flynn tells of our beloved Mitch Rapp. Another great book. He takes no crap from anyone and moves on with single minded focus. Finished it in just a few days and was sad that I read it so fast. If you're a Mitch Rapp fan, you'll enjoy this one too.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I bought this cd because I am a HUGE One Direction fan. It is fabLOUIS! I love every single song on the cd, and I hate to say this, but it might even be better than their first cd!!!! The bonus tracks are fun and catchy. In addition, the yearbook edition has pictures of the boys and fans inside. I love it and I recommend it!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I'm not joking.  This movie makes being a Trekkie cool.  JJ Abrams is brilliant, improving on the franchise in ways no one could foresee.  How many great spaceship battles do you remember from TOS, etc.?  Not many.  But, it still has the humor and moral complexities that were present throughout all of the tv episodes and movies.  The cast is amazing, the plot excellent.  I am now a real Trekkie and not afraid to admit it.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Very graphic and sometimes a bit disturbing how far these bootleggers will go to protect their profits, but it was a great movie from start to finish.

B001GCUER0|4.0|I can't complain about how fast I got it, but the second disc didn't play.  I guess when you buy something &#34;Like New&#34; or of good quality, you still get what you paid for.  But overall, other than the second disc not playing, it was good.
0451169514|5.0|I have had this book for a while, this is my second time reading it. the first time i closed it went to another book due to kings in depth descriptions. now that i have more patients this time i actually finished it. really enjoyed this book, it really sucks you in and you cant put it down. not recommended for children though due to some bad language. this is probably one of the best and longest novels i have read.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Why aren't you watching The Walking Dead?<br /><br />I would give six stars if it was possible.  Best show on TV.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Already got this for myself! Getting it for a family member! Such an amazing intense action movie! It has all the great super hero's! This bundle is by far the best bang for your buck too! Bluray 3D + Regular Bluray, DVD and digital copy for phones and tablets! Awesome!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wish someone had told me to read this year ago! this is one of those few books that I will reread.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|When young Abraham Lincoln angers a man (who happens to a vampire), the man takes his revenge by killing the boy's mother. Lincoln then dedicates his life to finding vampires and killing them with his silver-tipped ax.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, it's horrifically gory at times, but the clever mix of fantasy and true events is very well done and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. We follow Lincoln from store clerk to the White House. The movie isn't playing for laughs, it's utterly serious. I actually found it more entertaining than Daniel Day-Lewis' \\"Lincoln.\\"<br /><br />The title had me expecting a cheesy, low-budget slasher, but the production values are high and the special effects are excellent. The acting is also very good; Benjamin Walker plays a convincing Lincoln and Rufus Sewell is truly menacing as his nemesis.<br /><br />This is a surprising, clever story that includes just enough historical facts to make it almost plausible. A lot of blood, but still recommended.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I first started watching the Piano guys since their first few videos. At the time, I was in a Musical Appreciation class. I shared some of the songs with my teacher, and he too loved them and was going to start to use them as examples of how classical music can be blended in with contemporary, yet still remain pure. My husband and I LOVE having the cd and play it all the time while reading, relaxing, or when having friends over. Highly recommend!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I've read a lot of Vince's books and his great record continues.  His books are exciting, quick reads, don't recreate characters in every book, complex, and with just enough detail on people, places, and things.<br /><br />On the other hand, Kindle needs to watch spelling and grammer.  As I get Kindle books, I'm seeing more and more poor spelling and english across many author's books.  I hope it gets fixed.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Ok so Channing Tatum is a good dancer...that's about it.  The whole story line was pretty boring and the ending makes you wonder why you sat there so long thinking that the ending would be worth it.
B005PK553C|4.0|It's not what I expected but in many ways better, it can be a little confusing at first but it all makes sense after a couple of episodes. What more surprising is that it's from the creator of glee  which is totally the opposite of this show in terms of genre and plot but same type of humor at times. The actors are great to pull this off convincingly.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|So glad I bought this 2 season set. Can't imagine starting the new season without first seeing seasons 1 and 2. Love the series!
0847835073|5.0|This book meets all expectations if you not only like een wonderfull actress, but also like good photography.<br />all kinds of styles makes this italian woman more attractive as in life.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Great songs from great artists, final installment for the saga. Well worth it to get. Didn't know the songs before I ordered it, but glad I got it.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I had wanted to see it in theaters and am sad that I didn't.  This purchase was one of the best I've made in a while.  Would without a doubt recommend this movie.
B009KHVU7G|3.0|They should have quit while they were ahead.<br /><br />On the other hand, it came with several foreign language soundtracks and subtitles. This, for me, makes it worth watching over and over again.<br /><br />Service from the vendor was excellent. Would order from them again.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Season 2 is a lot better than the first and keeps most of the same characters, the plot can be a little far fetch even for its genre but all and all ties in nicely.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Not as intutive as they would have you believe but it does work.  I haven't used the usb yet but the SD card did transfer the files to my IPad 2.  However, it took me awhile to find them.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very well made and thought out little game.  Fun play for hours at a time!  Brings back memories from my childhood for sure!  Especially nice on the Kindle Fire HD! Simple controls for any age of gamer too!
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Captivating! You can imagine each part in the movie according to the music. It's a must have for twilight fans
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This movie was funny and good.  Kind of glad I waited for it to come out on DVD though.  If you like Johnny Depp, I'd recommend it but if you don't I wouldn't.
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|It doesn't load on the Kindle Touch.  I still can't find anywhere where it says this, I fond out the hard way.  What good is it if I have to lug around a PC to use the Cloud Reader?
0345529057|5.0|bought for my son, he loved the entire set, He wants more more more Good book for fantasy readers Now there is a TV Series
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My 3 and 5 yr old love this. They know I can only take so much noise for so long, so they butter me up by having the cat say, &#34;my dad is awesom&#34;. How can you not love that!?!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Nine year old read this book in two days.  He laughed all the way through.  Not all the pictures came through on my old Kindle but did on the kindle app on my ipad.  I'm sure it would on the newer versions.  I have the second generation.  Have it still because we love it.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I absolutely love this game.  can't wait for the part 3!!!  the graphics are out of this world, look  real not blurry or fake.  can't wait for the next one.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|The movie has a poor plot, and the acting is quite unexpected: all the cast could have a better performance.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|love 3d movies.  The story line is great.  Well worth the price the admission go out in buy a 3d t.v.
6304602979|5.0|sent to EOCI for prisoners to see, wrong rating needed R but I would still recommend this one to anyone
1582701709|5.0|I really like this book. It has helped me to be more positive and live a more happy life. Life is to short to live with negativity. I have read it several times to keep me growning on the right path.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the Magic.<br /><br />Thank you
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This awesome calculator has helped me so much with my homework. It helps me know that my homework is right. I love it so much. I highly reccomend it.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This movie was a little odd for me. Most of the characters didn't seem to fit their roles. It is a great story and the acting was good, it just never came together for me. AKWARD!
0979019710|5.0|Reading Hal Elrod's book The Miracle Morning is a must do in 2013. Make this your New Year resolution. Hal is an incredible, writer, speaker and person. His ideas will definatley transform what you do and how you can make the most of each day. Isn't that exciting to wake up and give yourself time for being creative and accomplishing goals. This is the miracle morning every morning. Hal has a quote that I love; \\"You are where you are because of who you were but where you go depends entirely on who you choose to be.\\" So true so read the book and change your self for the better. Unless of course you are already perfect. LOL.
B006GLMHBM|1.0|I thought I was buying the first season but it turnied out to be only ONE episode.  For that price I will put them on my DVR.
0061743526|5.0|I read this in high school and loved this book; however, I bought this for my wife because of the quality of the binding and the rough style cuts of the page.  While those are minor details to the book itself, it is a book that is amazing and continues to be enjoyable to read year after year!  I'll look forward to reading it with my kids when they are old enough to appreciate it.
1594135851|5.0|It was amazing nuff said. The characters are so well written i nearly cried at several points in the book.I cant wait to read the next book.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Awesome music!! This one is my favorite out of all her CD's. I also love the duet with Donny Osmond.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Not Flynn's best.  Predictable and slow. Perhaps Rapp is getting old and tired. On the other hand, his portrayal of power jealous, seeking bureaucrats who put their own careers ahead of the nation's security is spot on.
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game is a rip off  you can't craft in create and most of the items are there but most are not.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Anyone who loves music in general will love this product. The music is great for anytime in the day or year. I just love the way their music it can calm you and make you happy at the same time. I just think they are amazing!
1884883303|3.0|My main criticism of this book has always been the lack of information on some of the more popular vintage Guild guitars and the way the entire Guild section has been constructed. I pointed this out to one of the authors in 2010 but nothing has changed in this edition. Some of the smaller-body acoustics from Guild, like the M-20 and F-20 are missing altogether. And why are D-40 models among others listed in two separate places and on two different pages? It makes no sense not to have notations directing the reader to the other model years. This book probably would not have any value for the average musician or retail consumer, but for guitar dealers this book is an excellent tool to have in your arsenal. Just remember prices of vintage guitars can vary well beyond the average ranges listed in this guide.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Have just gotten chapter 10, but is so&#34;Steven King' with i love ..Am waiting for the other shoe to drop!!
0061914177|2.0|Its a quick read.  I like that its a fast paced approach to helping put a fire underneath you for getting you to go out there and 'crushing it' in your next business endeavor.  The only thing I don't like, is its push to sell using social media.  I believe this is backwards.  Social media is a tool that is helpful once you establish a fan base/customer base.  No one 'likes' a fan page on facebook without already being a fan of said author/musician/whatever.  No one follows a twitter account unless that person is already popular.  His approach in this book is backwards and time consuming if you think social media will make you a millionaire.  This book also left out a lot of the how-to's some would look for in establishing a book.  If you are looking to make money as an affiliate marketer, think again.  You'll need thousands of unique visitors daily, with only a percentage clicking your ads, with another smaller percentage actually buying the product and on top of all of this, your actually only making 4-6% per sale if your lucky.  If you want to make money online with a business that works, I'll cut it to the chase for you:  Create your own information product.  Not just an ebook, but a product.  A product is a collection of ebooks around one particular niche topic that you are well versed in.  Create a website around this through a blog, over deliver (creating more value than what the book is actually worth) and make sure its top notch quality.  Example would be to create a 100 dollar information product (a collection of a few ebooks around your topic), but under sell it for 30-50.  Its easier to sell this than say a ebook for 10 bucks.  Just my two cents!  After you establish a business, than you can use social media to help spread your business.  But don't use social media first.  Its a waste of time.    I also read \\"Social Media is Bulls***\\" by B.J. Mendelson gave me the insight on this using real world examples
B008K6HN8I|5.0|After a week of testing, I am very satisfied with this app.<br />It has done everything I have asked of it.<br />This is a great free product.  Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|it is read like a kindergartener wrote it. I couldn't even finish it. I just skimmed and found the kinky scenes. Lol....that was the only good part of the book....the kinky is REALLY kinky. :)
0764169742|4.0|This is a beautiful and helpful book. I would, however, have preferred more plants and flowers to vegetables and pods.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This has completely eliminated all of my lost scraps floating around the house. No more paper. And it goes everywhere with me on my tablet. Syncs automatically so switching my device still keeps my notes.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|fun games although I hate having to spend money to buy coins to get further in the game. but its fun to do with my 7 yr old.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Surrounding a true story, this movie becomes inherently interesting. Focusing more on the family than the era, the movie chooses right in highlighting stars like Tom Hardy and Shia Lebouf for their amazing acting abilities. Overall, and surprisingly, it turns out to be a feel good film :)
B008Y6UND6|4.0|I had high expectations from the novel and this movie delivered. I would recomend to anybody who has read the book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Awesome book.  Was a life changing read for me.  Would recommend it to anyone who is interested in improving their lives dramatically.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|as usual cornwell wrote an interesting and exciting novel.  i am looking forward to her newest book hpoe its soon

B008XX6J4C|5.0|What can I say- they never disappoint! This is GORGEOUS music- will lift your heart and soul. The videos are also so creative and unique!! Thanks to The Piano Guys for a great Christmas gift to please all my music lovers!!!
B0000024YL|5.0|I saw Simon & Garfunkel when I was 11 years old in Carbondale, Illinois at the SIU Arena - I was in awe. Still am!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The PianoGuys are worth listening to any time! I use their music as a teaching tool regularly. This album is wonderful for any age group.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wish there were more books. I'm really sad its over. Make sure to read the other books before reading this one though.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is not your typical damsel in distress movie where a prince comes and saves her. In this movie its all about female power. It doesn't even have a prince involved which is the best part because it sends a very important message about the female gender....we don't need a male to come and rescue us because we are fragile NO! WE CAN DO IT ALL ON OUR OWN. This movie is a defenite must see. Its empowering to women and little girls. Finally a movie from disney that actually empowers the princess to live hapily ever after without its night and shining armor!
B0050BPIB0|5.0|Love every single song.. Excellent lyrics and amazing voice!!! Love love love it!!!!<br />Best all around artist. The best!!! &#60;3
B002LMV7TS|5.0|My son loves this movie therefore so do I. So glad I found the combo pack at such a good price.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I put up with the pop up ads and can get rid of them easily'  Love the choice of choose a winning hand.  Can win most of the time if I play my cards right!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Very good holiday movie. I see it every year with the kids.  Will Ferrell is sooooo funny.  Must see Christmas movie!
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This moving was intense and entertaining, despite some small holes in story/plot, and a few scenes with less than convincing acting.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is super fun. You get missions you get to kill snd it gets harder as you go. What kind of game is more challenging and entertaining that this one....none.
0547884591|5.0|i already had this and bought a few more as gifts, excellent life book as well as an additional kitchen tool. great customer service.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My 3-year old great-nephew has been talking about wanting a watch non-stop for the past few months. This one is perfect.  He cannot tell time yet, cannot put it on by himself yet, but LOVES the watch. He likes the colors and his mother and grandmother say that this will be good fun for the rest of the year as he learns to put it on himself and to tell time.  Let's hear it for analog watches!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I've gone a long time without reading any of Kurt Vonnegut's novels and this is now the second I've read. War from the perspective of the little guy and without the &#34;I won the war&#34; bravado of so many novels of this class.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is awesome I play it on my ipad and it works just fine If you are going to buy it make the nether reacter.
1451696191|5.0|Stephen Chbosky's book, \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a tremendous story that documents the life of Charlie, a teenager who enters his freshman year of high school with depression and no friends.  He tries to navigate the murky social waters of adolescence by staying on the outside looking in, until his English teacher reminds him that he should participate in social activities.  It's because of this that he befriends two senior siblings, Sam and Patrick, who quickly expose Charlie to many things such as sex, drugs and the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Charlie documents his stories about family, friends, love and partying through letters to an anonymous friend.<br /><br />This book to me is a masterpiece of teen literature.  It perfectly depicts an adolescent with social issues from the point of view of the person themselves.  Chbosky masters the letter writing format in a way I've never seen before, as it excuses description and replaces it with realistic, witty, and honest writing that focuses on emotion rather than sensory details.  The book also deals with many mature topics such as drugs, violence, homosexuality, sex, molestation and mental disorders.  Instead of focusing on the heaviness of these topics, Chbosky finds a way to deal with the severity of these issues without scaring or making the reader uncomfortable.<br /><br />Charlie's story is riveting from the start and as a teenager, I feel as if anyone can relate to his story.  The realistic friendships, his enormous crush on Sam, his fun and mishaps while partying can certainly relate to anyone of the 14-30 age group.  But I believe anyone can like this book because anyone can relate to tits undeniably uplifting message.  A message of presence in one's life.  That no matter what, \\"you can't just sit there and put everybody's life ahead of yours think that counts as love.\\"  And also if you obtain a presence in your own life, you can achieve the feeling of being, \\"infinite\\"
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this  book was great an  I can't wait to buy the next book next year!! It comes out a day before my birthday
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Matched is one of the best books I've read in a long time! I love the poetic voices of the characters and the plot is unique and page turning!
0679809015|5.0|My son loves this book! He probably enjoys chewing on it more than reading it right now, since he is only 8 months old but this book definitely grabs his attention everytime I start reading it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loooove. Best show ever! And a good price considering i can always go back and watch it if i like
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book ever.  I love starting fights over this book.  It is very well written.  It is very entertaining.  I hope everyone can enjoy this for what it is.  A book for entertaining.
B009FZFONO|5.0|There is just something about seeing dead people tear into live flesh and blood that just makes you wanna curl up with the one you love and eat a big, juicy home-grilled turkey burger!<br />Really, tho, I've seen the previous seasons 3x already, and love it so much that I have forked out the $3 for each episode in HD just to keep up. Lame, I know, but there is no waiting for the Dead! Love this show.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I was wondering if I  made a mistake after I placed the order for this mixer.  I however, am very pleased with the mixer preformance for the price.  I use it in my home to listen to music and even plug my guitar in to play along.  Works great for that.  It doenst get moved and I'm the only one using it.  I love it!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like this app. The only thing I didn't like is that I can't play Marvel Alliance on my Kindle because it dosn't have the right software and it can't be downloaded to play it. But just for Facebook alone, it is by far the best I have seen and tried.
B000YDAYK4|5.0|I feel the quality is quite good and the shoes feels soft and comfortable.<br /><br />My feet is 40, and 6&#34; fit me well.
1601251505|5.0|I like the book. It is nice and sturdy, like the old encyclopedias that you used to find at the library. Will last the entire gaming life, as long as care and attention is given to it.
B009YJEKJK|5.0|John Travolta & Olivia Newton John still have that magical chemistry they had years ago. I am loving this Christmas album. Would love to see them reconnect on screen to.
B000002KBD|4.0|Must have for any Morrison collection. I especially like &#34;I'll Be Your Lover Too&#34;. A true gem among his countless hits.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These songs are amazing. They are all so different in personality, but each are perfectly balanced. I'd have to say that Bourne Vivaldi is a favorite of mine. I love the fusion of classical and other loved contemporary pieces. This album is perfect.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|while it looks similar to Tetris, it is not. It's its own game, but lacks the intesity to keep me interested.  I have always liked puzzle games and this one just dosn't make me think too much.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved this game! It is a lot of fun to make my own animal village. And I get to play games inside the whole app. I would recommend buying this app.
B0090EJR1K|3.0|Cohen just can't seem to compete with his classic Borat. Much more tolerable than Bruno, the Dictator fail to live up to any comical standards and the overall love story leaves a lot to be desired. Not bad, just not going to go out of my way to watch it again.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is such an amazing CD.  I've found that when I hear original versions of popular songs that The Piano Guys have transformed, I'm left wanting The Piano Guys version every time!  My only complaint would be the overlap of songs from the self released CD to this one, but there's still enough variety to keep me happy and lost in the melodies of The Piano Guys.  If you're not sure before buying, check out their Youtube Videos and you will be hooked!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Love it. Like his version of the holiday songs. Have been playing it at my salon in rotation with Michael bublee & Harry connick jr
B009O2XY12|3.0|okay problem #1 says no Internet connection &amp;has stopped working,  #2 ask for money after couple rounds or u can wait 20 minutes and it will give u a couple of more rounds...WHO WANTS TO WAIT 20 TO PLAY 3ROUNDS NOT I..DELETING GAME SORRY CAUSE I LOVE IT.. gave u a 3 Cu's I do like the game itsself when I get to play
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I always like to know the temperature and like the fact that I can just press a button and all the info I want is right there.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found The Piano Guys on the internet and fell in love with there music, which encouraged me to buy their downloadable CD. The music on it is for all generations, and even my 13 year old son loves their sound. He especially loves the Cello Wars, which happens to coincide with his favorite topic, Star Wars!!! I play it in my car on the way to work, and on the way home, and it really helps me to calm down after a really stressful day. Not only have they taken classics and twisted them to be better than ever, but they take new songs and give them a fresh breath too!!! I love their work, and I am looking forward to another album from them... hopefully soon!!!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Not many times these days do I consider adding a movie to my personal collection, but this may just be one.
B00594XOZU|5.0|this is a really good app. I also recommend instagram, u can get it on 1mobile.com. kik is a super good app cause you can send photos and stuff
B008KWHKGM|4.0|This is one of my daughter's music. I listen to parts of some songs and did not like them. I actually do not know much about the band either. I gave it four stars just to be fair but I never heard of this band before my daughter asked me to buy it for her so I cannot give a valid review.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Such a good album! It's been fun to see them mature from Jon Schmidt by himself to JS with Steven Sharp Nelson on the side to The Piano Guys! Great arrangements on some great songs, and the music videos are even better. Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates music.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. My wife strats falling asleep with the music while I play it at night. We both love this game.  :)
0061914177|5.0|I am a big fan of Gary, and think he is a fascinating speaker. This book reads a lot like one of his live talks, which are full of insights and accurate predictions. I read it probably in late 2010 and it is interesting to see how some of his predictions panned out.<br /><br />Gary knows what he's talking about, and he has a lot of valuable things to say.
B00005JM02|5.0|Husband and I watched it together and enjoyed it immensely. This has always been a favorite of mine but I had it on tape only and needed to get it on disc.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|In a world with so much music of all varieties, true beauty is rare. Music played for the sake of it's beauty that does not prefer to stoop to vulgarity and sexual references to seduce listeners is rare. The Piano Guys is the best of that music. The music soars while becoming personal and pulling you in. I love listening to all the their songs no matter what I'm doing or where I am. This is a must for anyone.
159514188X|5.0|I thought this book was great - definitely an easy read, but a haunting story that kept me coming back. I read this in about a day & a half, I couldn't stop thinking about it! Entertaining for any adult, but more relatable for high school-aged teens - would not recommend for young adults, it's a bit too dark/risque.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|This is a great music CD,This is a great music CD,This is a great music CD,This is a great music CD.
B000FC0ZAI|3.0|I saw the trailer for the movie, which inspired me to buy the book. I was dissapointed. Although I was intrigued by the story of the balloons, i didn't quite grasp the story line. It seemed jumbled and confusing. Especially Lily.
0399536108|5.0|I was a fan of Chris' blog before I picked up this book, and it is a really solid read. He is a really good writer and has an inspirational story to boot. I think he is in a pretty good position to be writing about living unconventionally as he is currently on his last year of traveling to every single country in the world (before age 35).<br /><br />I like the fact that his philosophies can be applied to most walks of life, and not just someone who wants to quit their job and work for themselves. He has a lot of insights here.
B007704HO6|5.0|Excellent read, simple story well written, a heart warming story. I read it from cover to cover over a long day by the pool.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Nothing much to say here....  I liked this movie as a kid when I first watched it. In my opinion, everyone in our Great Country should see this film and be glad to be an American while you still have rights and freedom from this type of imprisonment.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I like Gerber better then handyman, because I have found Gerber takes longer to bleed rust working in salt conditions. So I say this tool works good for me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show has it all.  It weaves drama, characterization, cinematography, good acting.  It's well worth a watch! I highly recommend it!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|One of the things I enjoy most about listening to The Piano Guys is knowing that THEY truly enjoy their music and performances.  Their music evokes a sense of wonderment and I can't help but marvel at their ability to turn timeless classics into contemporary variations.<br /><br />If you've ever watched a video on youtube, you'd know that their work is fun yet refined, and sometimes silly, yet profound.<br /><br />I always look forward to another one of their releases.
0671646788|5.0|This book, despite being published in 1959, is still one of the most relevant books out there today on motivation and success. It seems totally cheesy if you read any of it out of context, but from his perspective as a psychologist, it is very well thought-out.<br /><br />I still pick this book up about 1-2x a year and recently have put all my notes from the book into a word document, and that alone was about 10 pages of material.<br /><br />Solid, solid read.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've been against purchasing any game, app, or what have you. I figured why buy when you can play for free. Needless to say  this is the first game I have ever purchased. Absolutely worth every cent! I can honestly say I will be purchasing other &quot;big fish&quot; games in the future.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Loved playing this &#34;birds game&#34; but did not find it all the challenging.  Finished the entire game in just two sittings.
030746363X|4.0|The author even tested everything out himself. There are lots of great tips in the book and it contains the info to buy any equipment you might need (like the sleeping device, etc.)
0316228532|5.0|I love JKR's writing style. She could write the instructions on how to assemble IKEA furniture and find a way to make it an enjoyable read.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit - the book started slow. It took me a couple of months to finish. I kept putting it down, then picking it back up for another chance. Sure, my busy schedule doesn't exactly give me hours out of my day to lounge on the couch and enjoy a book, but I didn't find myself staying up until 2am reading it, knowing that I would be bleary-eyed and useless at work the next day.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, there are a lot of characters, they are thrown at you at a fairly rapid rate, and trying to remember their names and the relationships they have with others was the biggest hurdle for me. Being that this story is deeply rooted in small-town politics and gossip, those names and relationships become very important. I think this is why the beginning has a sizable buffer to work through before you start enjoying the book fully. She does a good job to keep reemphasizing and hinting at who they are and how they relate, otherwise I'd have been hopelessly lost. After I started to pick up on these and remember who everyone was (~1/3 of the way into the book), I began to really enjoy it, and I had a few 2am nights.<br /><br />As for the mention of not connecting with characters and crying at the end... I'm the type that connects deeply with the characters of a well written book, and when bad things happen to them, it does bother me... a lot.<br />I didn't shed a single tear at the end of this book, nor was I overly saddened that I had come to the end of something great. It's not to say that it wasn't well written or that the characters were hard to connect with - not at all. It's not to say that I even expected what happened. I suppose it felt like that was just how things were destined to be, though I would have never guessed it. When I reflect on why this is, I hold the book in higher regard. It madesomething terrible very easy to swallow, and that is a rare thing for me - It's somewhat enlightening. Well done, Mrs. Rowling.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'd recommend it very highly. It takes a bit of work to really get into, but it keeps you wondering, and I really feel like she allows you the opportunity to connect with many different people. There is no focal main character, but rather whoever you sympathize with... they all have equal opportunity for your attention, and I think that's brilliant. It's different than most books, where you're led by the hand and told what to think.<br /><br />I think a second read would be truely enjoyable all the way through. Not too soon, but I'll pick it back up in a year and give it another go. The intracies of her stories always leave something missed or a connection overlooked. Not to mention that with a full understanding of the characters and relationships, the beginning of the book will probably be just as intriguing as the rest.<br /><br />Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I find this to be a beautifully written book. Maybe you don't, but that's fine... to each their own. To expect something from JKR is naive - Harry Potter is over, move on. Don't cut her down if you didn't enjoy this. I've found that the negative reviews are based on the expectations that people place upon her. You can't fully enjoy something for what it is, if all the while you were waiting for and hoping for something else. You'll always be disappointed to an extent.<br /><br />As a warning - this was written without spellcheck, and in a bit of a hurry, so I apologize for and embarrased by any grammatical errors that you may find.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Was not what i had expected but was presently supervised how intense and strong story and moral it had to family.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have followed Jon Schmidtt for the past couple of years, and for the past year Stephen Sharp Nelson and The Piano Guys.  I have several cds, sheet music and books of Jon's and recently purchased The Piano Guys debut album.  I absolutely love every video they have created and love the CD.  My family and I had a chance to see Jon in concert in February at Middle Georgia College, he was absolutely fantastic as a performer and a hilarious entertainer. I have The Piano Guys cd in my car, and on a recent trip, my daughter laughed and said \\"hey mama, I think this is about the 5th time this cd has played.\\" I asked her if she wanted to listen to something else, she replied, \\"of course not.\\" It is just that good, I listen to it over and over! Cannot wait for the next cd and hopefully another concert in our area!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|lots of fun for the kids...wish they had more than one account per kindle though. I guess it's a good thing that we have three children and three kindles....
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are what modern society needs. Their music combines new age music with their own classical roots and the results are outstanding. There is nobody else like them and I honestly think they are going to take off and become very popular nationwide soon. It is nice to see people with real talent succeeding in the music industry for a change. They are humble individuals as well, so it is nice to see them do well. I could not suggest a better CD with music that will touch your soul any more than this.
B008GB2ALW|5.0|I have been reading this book to my daughter since she was 3 months old.  She loves the large, bright pictures.  She never gets tired reading it.  Although my husband has gotten tired of me reading it to her! :)
B0090EJR1K|2.0|This movie has some very funny parts.  On the funny side I would give it a 4.  However, it is very vulgar in parts to the point of being disgusting.  The previews don't show any of these parts of course.  I definitely do not recommend this movie for children.  Beware, this movie also drastically stereo types various cultures.  If that offends you, don't watch.
B008Y1YKE4|3.0|I guess i had higher expectations for this move, it is sow start and i liked better the second time it ends well with good moral.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie was ok at times funny but overall not to too funny, Johnny Depp really makes the movie as he does with Pirates, if your interested in something different to watch it will fill the bill.
B00009NQQO|1.0|It arrived broken and seems very flimsy and poorly made.  The idea for the toy is great as my kids would love playing ball in the tub.  Wouldn't buy again.
B009E3EY38|4.0|The concert DVD is great!  It's awesome to see these guys on the stage doing what they do best.  The last rehearsal dvd is a waste of plastic.  They set up a camara 100 yards away in a stationary place and that's it.  All in all, it's Zeppelin and that's always good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app for the kindle fire that actually works. professional looking graphics keys are larger and display is easy to read  nice backspace feature and memory .
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I watched the movie every Christmas Eve as a child and I have seen it probably 100 times, but I still love it!  I was thrilled that you still had it.  I haven't recieved it as yet, but I expect it will be anyday.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Well done and entertaining to me and especially for my kids they love this show it is good clean show.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|all star cast, a sappy romantic movie I have seen many, many times.  guaranteed to make me cry without fail.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys just keep rolling!  Can't get enough of their music and can't wait for the next wonderful rendition of another favorite song!
B0090O07S2|5.0|It's a classic Doors concert!  The quality is great.  Jim Morrison is in stunning color and it looks so current.<br /><br />Hardcore fans have seen all the footage over the last few decades, but not like this.  Plus, there is some bonus material with Bruce Botnik talking about the technical details.  I highly recommend this DVD for your collection.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I did not add this to my Kindle Fire HD my computer son did so that I could use my Kindle Fire HD to take videos with. Works well.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|use it all day every day, keep in touch with all those far away and enjoy sharing funny things. the best

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Great reading for young and old alike.  Recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next movie.
6305428042|5.0|Great movie, good quality, arrived quickly and as expected. I love watching this fun movie each year. A must-have to watch every Halloween!
B003L77GG0|5.0|The dvds were all in great shape, can't beat the price...  Get yourself some today.  Why am I REQUIRED to put a certain number of words?
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A amazing story!  Really can give you just a little idea of what kind of sacrifices are being made for you every day in combat
B006JTS5OO|4.0|I enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes and bloopers on Blu-ray; the intermission feature was cool. Getting 3 disks for 1 affordable price was a real bargain
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I loved it. The dim bulbs out there can just go sit and spin.<br />I'm not sure if anyone caught it, but Aaron Cross(Kitsom)& David Cross (Bourne )? Seems to me there is a whole new story for that franchise in bringing the two together. How did they get hooked up with these programs? Ultimatum wasn't clear enough.[[ASIN:B00A7CI82I The Bourne Legacy]
B000OIZUW6|5.0|IF YOU ARE A KEN FOLLETT FAN LIKE I AM, AND YOU DON'T READ JACKDAWS, THAN YOU HAVEN'T READ KEN FOLLETT. THIS IS SUCH A WELL WRITTEN STORY, THAT YOU MIGHT TAKE A DAY OFF FROM WORK TO FINISH IT.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|The Director's cut version was a fun escape of cool action, buddy humor, and special effects.  I can't speak for the theatre version as I didn't see it, however, judging from a few reviewers comments, the Directors Cut apparently improves nicely on the original.<br />  Without giving away too much in the way of spoilers, I'd have to say the back and forth banter between the stars is like a band of combat experienced brothers, that have been to hell and back, kidding around and picking on each other until its time to get into badass action against the baddies where all heck breaks loose in personal combat, special effects, badass weapons, and explosives.  At times, I found myself saying \\"Whoa, WTF! That is sooo cool !!\\"<br />  Sylvester Stallone is the leader that holds it all together. The Expendables team crew has most everyone you could ask for in the way of old time heroic action stars. I'm sure you could add more but for me these were plenty.  The bad guy and his cronies are believable, formidable, and the type you \\"love to hate\\" and you just want to see get their just desserts ! And they DOOO!! Nothing is ever easy and these baddies put up a hell of a fight but in the end its....  Yippie ki yaaa ...Hasta la Vista, Baby !!  Yeeee-Haawww !  Foward Men!!<br />  Along the way, the characters have their own humorous and/or not quite so serious personal issues popping up like \\"whack a moles\\" that add to the movie and let us feel for them as human beings as well as play on the charisma of the individual stars involved.  Even the bad guys have their moments when you think \\"Hmmmm, they must have had a bad upbringing or something, they're only human\\"- but boy are they NASTY! and must be blown up, shot down, pureed in a blender, or what have you...before they do it to yooouuu...!!\\" and the Expendables are the answer!!<br />  If you like these kind of action movies with these actors and humor then see it by all means. It won't dissapoint!
B000TERDNO|3.0|It's kind of weird that some songs are live and some are studio-recorded.  It's okay but I had hoped for more hits and overall better experience.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book, keeps your attention the entire book.  Very well told story that makes you feel like you are there
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is perfect for when you are bored and cant find anything else to do.It is very entertaining for little kids.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I bought this movie, put on the 3D glasses, moved my recliner about 5 feet away from my 55 inch LG, cranked up the surround sound system poured a dark beer and just was amazed by this movie in 3D.  It is definitely the greatest 3D movie put out to date.  I was just taken back by the quality and just the ah factor.  Highly Recommend!  One for the collection for sure!
1416594795|5.0|I really wanted to know about evolution. I was not taught it in school, and I wanted to gather the evidence for evolution, well, thats what we got here. I aint no darn geen-yus, but i do consider myself moderately intelligent, and this book does a very good job at breaking it down in terms I could easily understand. He even gets as down-to-it as explaining what a proton and electron are like 9th grade chemistry day one stuff. This book did what i wanted it to which was introduce me to evolution and the facts supporting it.....
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie.  Personally I was taken aback by the number of changes in the movie versus the &#34;true&#34; story, which we looked up online.  So this is loosely based on the actual story.  NONETHELESS, this is a great inspirational movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is great and so handy to have on my kindle.  I use it all of the time.  I love it!
B005LAIIHG|1.0|[[ASIN:B005LAIIHG Life of Pi]]<br />This Movie Should NEVER, EVER have been rated PG<br />In the beginning I was excited to see this movie as were the two elementary children accompanying me.  The previews were exhilarating and quite interesting--a boy shipwrecked and training his tiger.<br /><br />The cinematography was interesting and beautiful, but none of us were prepared for the blatant killing of an innocent goat by the tiger (father forcing his children to watch). The death of one's entire family is shocking to a child and then conveniently left out of the previews, there was more than just a tiger aboard the lifeboat with the life and death predicaments that created.<br /><br />Although there was not a lot of blood and gore, a child can still figure out what is happening and that was scary enough, but the ending was shocking and deplorable for a very young person to hear and think about, let alone grasp the real meaning and implication of the narative by the young man in his hospital bed at the end.<br /><br />By the time the movie was over, it had ruined a perfectly lovely evening and we all went home quite depressed and we had to try to explain the unthinkable to two lovely children.<br /><br />Again this movie should NOT be rated PG and one should not have to rely on word-of-mouth to know not to bring a minor to a PG rated film.  There must be a better system so that if you look up a movie online there could be a checklist of the type of content a film contains (including horrifying life and death scenes that a child would have great difficulty with.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to this movie but in the end it was just depressing.  Aside from the cinematography, I cannot recommend this movie even to an adult unless you enjoy depressing entertainment.
B005529BDK|4.0|I played this game on the Nook Color and loved it.  Unfortunately, it is not compatible with the Kindle Fire HD tablet and that is why it did not receive 5 stars from me.
B00975L81Y|3.0|This is not typical Cradle of Filth album. No more mystical atmosphere as in &#34;Dusk...&#34;, &#34;Cruelty...&#34; or &#34;Midian&#34;. It is pity. But still sounds great.
B009A87X80|5.0|I have everything she has ever sung that I know about.  I only wish I had been able to see her in concert myself.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an absolutely awesome app that lets you read the Bible on your phone or other device. The true power comes in where you can highlight and bookmark passages. The bookmarking lets you add tags to easily put together related verses. The bookmarks are saved to the YouVersion website if you sign up for an account which makes reviewing the even easier.<br />Another huge plus to this is you have multiple versions of the Bible, so you can choose your favorite. Some of the versions even let you hit play and have someone read them to you. I never got so much out of the Bible as when I heard it and read it at the same time. This makes daily devotions easy. This makes writing a sermon easy when you pull up your bookmarks by tag.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|Love anything with Johnny depp-he always brings the characters he plays to life!!! especially love it when he does Tim Burton movies!
0765357151|5.0|This is not only a suspense novel like the movie, it is a struggle of a man trying to live in a world where he is the last one on earth.<br /><br />Saying that, I loved this book because of the inner lines that the thinking of the character develops, you can distinguish how his mind works. You can see him struggling with his thoughts, even lying to himself to stay sane.<br /><br />It may have happened to you that you are in a situation when you start saying a sentence and you change it because you know it could be hurtful to the listener, but your hesitation is noticed by them, and they know what was on your mind and why you decided to change it.<br /><br />Well, this is what happens in the struggle of the character, you (the listener) can notice how his monologs drifts because he must stay sane, so the author is giving us not only his thoughts but more than that, and that is incredible.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are wonderful.  Great uplifting music and the videos are so much fun to watch.  I gave my daughter one of their CDs because she is always looking for something to listen to while studying.  She said the Piano Guys were perfect!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Wow.. Speechless.. The blu-ray is worth every penny and the price can't be beat by anyone!! This seriously is a must have!!! If you like batman in anyway?! Then you must get this NOW!!!!

I'm always on the edge of my seat waiting to hear what they will come out with next!!

B000001OAA|5.0|When I discover this record back in 1996, I realized that this group was not one more. Time confirmed that sentence. The sound is totally new and the creative work put on it made one if not the best first record of a band. All tracks are unique and unforgettable; from the open Supervixen to the wonderful closing title Milk.<br />This record is a must for contemporary music. Nothing less.

B0053O89RY|4.0|I love Modern Family, but I didn't care for the third season as much as the first two.  That's probably because the kids aren't little anymore.  But, it is well worth getting.  Still a fan !
1400049628|5.0|I Bought this for my wife who is a zombie fanatic and she has gone off non stop about how the book tells you how to survive a Z-D-Day or 12/21/12 xD good book though
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I can say this book wasn't my cup of tea. The story line was predictable and the book overall wasn't very compelling. I Probably won't bother reading the other two books in the trilogy. I must say I am surprised with the popularity of this book with adults but to each his or her own.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|I bought this for my niece and nephew, partly because it's so old I knew that wouldn't own it already. But upon re-watching it, I was struck by how gentle it seemed compared to most of what they see. The story is well paced, but not frantically so. And how many kids these days are familiar with old school farm life and animals?<br /><br />A wonderful live-action movie for the whole family. No gratuitous violence, no wisecracking animated characters making&#34;hip&#34; pop culture references or winks at other movies. Farm animals with distinct personalities and voices that convey character and intelligence. Full of comedy and drama. Great life lessons and a triumphant ending. One scary dog fight and a near escape from death from the title character, but compared to the violence of video games and other movies, I think kids can handle it.

This set will make a wonderful display in my curio cabinet for years to come.  I think it is also a wonderful set to pass down to younger generations in your family as an heirloom.

B009K0OPQQ|5.0|This is one of the most original and entertaining shows I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time.  I didn't think the writers could do better than Season One, but this season is even better.  What I like most is that you get to see the backstory for the characters, and it's fun to see how the have evolved into who they are today.  The characters aren't all good or bad either.  They are layered.  I especially enjoy the struggle Regina seems to face.  She is the evil queen, but there is a softer side of her that is well portrayed in this season.  The struggle to do good or bad is profound with her, something I especially enjoy.  I also like that I can watch this with my children.  It's hard to find shows that children and adults can enjoy together anymore.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put 'Wool' the omnibus edition down! It was probably the best series I have ever read... It is smart, witty, descriptive and truly a remarkably written book(s). I already attempted to recommend to a co-worker, but she had already read it! She was thankful to have found someone to discuss with...  Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys reading!

1118156315|4.0|This book build upon the principles outlined in Business Model Generation and then applied to &#34;YOU&#34; being yourself. An interesting interpretation for an introspection but not as groundbreaking as the first book by Alex Oterwalder and Yves Pigneur. Looking forward to working with them at the upcomiong European Meetings & Events Conference for Meeting Professionals Internation at the end of Janiuary 2013 in Montreux, Switzerland. Would I recommend to read it -&#62; yes definitely. But read Business Model Generation first to get the most out of this sequal.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Luckily, I opened my copy of this package on day 1 (December 4, 2012). Apparently, you have to redeem the code by that day. BE CAREFUL if you want the UVVU copy on your computer. I don't know if this is happening to anyone else.<br /><br />For the review of the actual trilogy. You get all three movies and that's what I will be looking at. All three are amazing movies and they tie in together. That's what it means to be a trilogy. Here's what you should know.<br /><br />Batman Begins: Looks at Batman's origins and into his psyche as he fights his first villain.<br />The Dark Knight: As the Batman, Bruce Wayne will use his detective skills to take down another villain.<br />The Dark Knight Rises: The tragedy from 'The Dark Knight' weighs heavily on Bruce Wayne as he faces the consequences from 'Batman Begins'.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I have enjoyed immensely Vince Flynn's stories of espionage, fighting against terrorists and the story line of Mitch Rapp and Thr Last Man continues this storyline forward.  After a couple of stories going back to his beginnings as an assassin it is good to see a mature Mitch facing a tremendous challenge.  Great storyline with some terrific twists and those who have read the previous Flynn books will appreciate the inclusion of Mitch's past in this adventure.  A great read and good gift idea for your adventure lover.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm from a rural area and drove the 2 hours south to the nearest Barns and Noble to buy this CD. It was worth it! The music is relaxing and fun at the same time. The Piano Guys make classical music interesting for todays generation. Their music is safe for my children, they love the videos on YouTube and watching them has become our Sunday tradition. So glad to have your CD!

B0091JQH76|5.0|This set is an amalgamation and re-release of a centenary set EMI issued in 4 boxes of 5 CDs each in 1998 (you can still find three of them on Amazon, like this one: [[ASIN:B0000241R0 Poulenc: Concertos, Orchestral & Sacred Music  (Edition du Centenaire, 1899-1963)]]).<br /><br />The recordings are from the 1960's and remastered in 1998 when the centenary set was originally issued.  There is one new short track added \\"Un joueur de flute berce les ruines\\" for solo flute, but the rest is a direct copy from the original discs.<br /><br />I'm not usually a huge fan of these older recordings, but these are almost all fantastic and hold a special authoritative weight, as Poulenc himself was present when these works were recorded (I'm not sure if he was present for all of them).  He is also one of the two pianists in his Concerto for Two Pianos, which makes for a special treat.<br /><br />The original set was a little bit better in that it included essays and short descriptions of each of the works (which is included here), but also the texts of his many many songs and operas, which are missing here (though the original set only had the texts in French with no translations).  You can search around and find texts and translations of Dialogue des Carmelites, but almost everything else is tougher to find.  Some might find that ok since some of his early music's texts is mostly nonsense and abstractionism and his later music is mostly religious.  But I prefer to keep the texts handy and improve my French.<br /><br />I won't go too much into Poulenc's music, since it's a matter of taste.  I prefer his later works to his earlier ones -- I like the development of his later style with the bittersweet melodies that still maintains a very \\"suave\\" and unmistakably French flavor to his music, and tend to shy away from the spikier early music.  Instead, I'll focus on the performances.<br /><br />In terms of performances, most of them really cannot be beat.  The orchestral works are unparalleled.  I am especially impressed with the thunderousness of the Organ Concerto, the elegance of the Piano Concerto, and the exuberance of the Sinfonietta.  The list goes on.  Les Biches and Aubade are nice, but the real standout of the ballets is Les Animaux Modeles.<br /><br />The vocal and opera works are also close to perfect.  It makes a huge difference that almost all of the singers are French.  Poulenc wrote his vocal works (and a lot of his non-vocal works) so that the text flows almost conversationally with the music; the singing line never sounds forced, and the performances are almost always well balanced between the voice and its accompaniment, whether it's a piano or a full orchestra.  All three operas are presented beautifully here (I consider La Voix Humaine to be a mini one-act).  The way Poulenc sets his music is that you feel that you almost don't need the texts to understand what is being sung.  Almost.<br /><br />The piano works are also overall beautifully played with Gabriel Tacchino, Bernard Ringeissen, Jaques Fevrier performing all of the works.  There's a lot of little works, so they can kind of bleed together.  But they are all entertaining and hold the attention a little bit better than a composer like Satie.  The chamber works are very good too, but sometimes they sound a little overmiked.  I find the complete chamber works on Naxos are an excellent set of reference recordings that provide a fresh perspective that are often a bit more crisp sounding.<br /><br />For the completists, this set isn't truly complete because there are some small bits and bobs missing.  For example, La Soiree de Nazelles for some strange reason is missing a few of the variations.  Or Les Animaux Modeles is the suite and not the full ballet (two scenes are excluded from the suite).  This bothers my OCD side just a smigden, but only because I like both of those works so much that I wonder what's missing and why they would bother to do that.<br /><br />I am glad to see this set back in print because it is close to flawless and Poulenc is an underappreciated composer.  Woe unto you if your French is lousy on top of not having the texts, because you're missing out on some gems.  It's not as devastating as not having texts for the Stravinsky set that's out there, but you are missing out on a very rich layer of appreciation for this 20th century genius.d to see this set back in print because it is close to flawless and Poulenc is an underappreciated composer.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|The book is interesting but I'm giving only 2 stars because 50% of the book is: thanking whoever help the author and  words index (?) - 5% is too much of a medical big words (this part would be interesting because is a kind of debate to explain/proof the experience) and 25% of biography of the author - So is leaves 20% for the actual experience spread along all the other subjects.

B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Quirky film as you would expect from W.A.  Not quite up to Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, but the two young characters to a decent job.  Small roles for Edward Norton, Bill Murray.

B0077QS9C6|4.0|I am not a car racing fan per se, but it is a very interesting documentary.  Would definitely recommend seeing it if you like documentaries.
B004SEUJUU|5.0|After a traumatic event, young Wolverine and his brother Victor run away from home and throw themselves into a series of wars, ranging from the Civil War to Vietnam (They age MUCH slower than a normal person, and are also nearly unable to die. Lucky.) They join a special squad of mutants, and follow lots of orders they don't really understand or agree with, and soon Wolverine is getting sick of the whole thing. Victor, however, is growing to love it more. Too much. Finally, something snaps, and Wolverine bails, opting for a quiet life in the Canadian(?) countryside. Of course, a quiet life was never meant to be for Wolverine, and soon enough his world is being turned upside down again by the people he'd forsaken years ago, hoping never to see again. Lies turn out to be true, truths turn out to be lies, and you'll never look at Wolverine the same again.<br /><br />As always, Hugh Jackman is an amazing actor, and the only one I can imagine for the character of Wolverine. He even made that one scene with the stereotypical &#34;NOOOOOOOOO!&#34; not that bad. Sabertooth was an even better choice: Liev Schreiber fits this role to a 't'! I absolutely loved him in this, and couldn't wait for scenes with him in them. Just the right amount of cockiness, a hint of insanity in the eyes, and a smug grin that I couldn't hate no matter how hard I tried. Absolutely perfect.<br /><br />I haven't seen this pair together since &#34;Kate and Leopold,&#34; and I couldn't be more pleased with their chemistry on set. It just... fits.<br /><br />Off the actors and on to the movie itself: The comedy isn't strong by any means, but it does show itself occasionally, and usually hits its mark without seeming clich&eacute; or dumb. It isn't &#34;laugh for hours&#34; funny, but it should give you a little smile to break up all the seriousness.<br /><br />This movie is a prequel to the X-Men trilogy, and it details Wolverine's life from childhood (a brief coverage) to where he is at the beginning of the first X-Men movie. His past with lifetime enemy Sabertooth, his transformation into an Adamantium-boned weapon, his quest for revenge wrought with so many twists and turns that it'll leave you staggered, and how he becomes the man with no memory, searching for answers, that we see in the main trilogy.<br /><br />There's a whole lot of action in this movie: things blowing up, machine guns, awesome mutant fight scenes, but it doesn't get stale like so many others with TOO MUCH action. There's still a strong story-telling element that allows for action without overshadowing the whole point of the show and leaving you with that &#34;are they done fighting yet?&#34; feeling. (Personally, I got that feeling from the Lord of the Rings and Narnia fight scenes, so you can use that as a scale if you want.)<br /><br />I've heard a lot of negative feedback about the character of Deadpool, mostly from fans of the original comics, but I (who hasn't read the comics) find no problem with him. His story is not canon (in agreement with the original), but it works well with the movie. Bottom line: if you've read the comics and can't imagine Deadpool any other way, you're going to hate him in this movie. If you're like me and haven't read it, or are open to a different take on him, he's a pretty sick villain. I've also heard complains about Will.i.am being cast as John Wraith, but I honestly liked him. Yeah, he's rapper, that doesn't mean he HAS to be a bad actor.<br /><br />Oh, and stick around for the end of the credits. In typical Marvel style, you'll get a little tidbit if you do, and it absolutely sent shivers up my spine! A brilliant last touch. And no, it's not Samuel L. Jackson!<br /><br />For me, a really great movie has to have that moment of realization, where (sometimes simultaneously with the main character) you just GET IT. You get WHY and HOW and it gives you goosebumps. It's an awesome feeling, and this had that for me.<br /><br />In conclusion I will say once again: If you're a rabid fan of the comics, you aren't going to like this. It's not canon and other mutants only appear briefly (than again, it's not their names in the title of the movie, right?). But, if you're open to viewing this as separate from (maybe even unrelated to) the comics, or have never read them at all, I really think you're going to love it.<br /><br />Thanks for reading all my ranting!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really can't say how much I enjoy this. I have always been a fan of the Piano Guys and this album has some of their bests. If you are looking for something that is both really fun to listen to and also shows an incredible amount of creativity and talent then this is for you.

B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Chirstopher Nolan and Christian Bale have done a great job with this epic trilogy.  This is almost as good as the first in the series.  Very entertaining, but not the best of the three.

030758836X|5.0|It was an awesome book!  Couldn't put it down!  Disappointed in the ending though, but definitely still worth 5 stars.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|An amazing look back into the not too distant past at another way of life.......incredibly beautiful to look at......incredibly interesting! Gives you some insight into the British aristocracy! So different from the American way of life....and copied by early American aristocracy! You cannot help being drawn into the Downton Abbey world!
B0054NRC6S|5.0|Great cast!  Movie is very timely these days. The trailer was good enough to pique my interest to rent the movie.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Very exciting and action packed. This has a great surprise ending. Christian Bale is hands down the best Batman ever!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Found my self laughing out loud at numerous times...witty....sarcastic humor , intertwined with a fast paced plot.  Loved it. It was a great &#34;trip&#34; to be in the mind of John Corey and Nelson DeMilles handle of Arabic translation was magnificent !!!
0345803493|4.0|I thought the Fifty Shades Trilogy was just ok.  Th sex got annoying.  But once you read the first, you gotta finish the trilogy to find out what happens.  And I think the ending of each book did just that.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This 2001 Chinese film (subtitles) features the same director and actress as the more recent Hero and House of Flying Daggers.  The Road Home does not include the martial arts of the later films.  It is a simple story of  Di, a girl in rural China who falls in love with the new school teacher.  The story is told in retrospect when their son goes home to bury his father.  Di's determination to win the man she loves and then to give him an appropriate remembrance at his death is both sweet and strong.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|How can you not love this cast in the show?  It is beautifully filmed, perfectly cast, and I can't wait to see Maggie Smith each show. Splendid. Simply a pleasure and reminder of such different times. Rent it!
B009VB7QQA|5.0|What a great ride! How intersting and thoughtful this writer is! I thought I was going to hate this, but it was very exciting and action packed.
B001KS0THU|5.0|Remake of Rio Bravo - still great!  Rio Bravo was made as a counterpoint to High Noon where everyone helps the sheriff instead of running off on him like in High Noon.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I came into it with low expectations and they were completely blown away. Great and interesting characters that are deeper than expected. Interesting world that you can tell has a ton of depth just waiting to be explored. I have a very short list of authors that I consider must reads and this one just got added to it. Can't wait for the next book.
0061969664|4.0|I haven't read any Cornwell for a while but have filled in time reading other writers in the same genre. I've just finished Death of Kings and have to say \\"nobody does it better.\\" Admitted, with a hero like Uhtred to work with an author really has prime ammunition for action and mayhem; and Cornwall takes full advantage here. Uhtred is irreverent, cynical and violent and his passion for life leaps from these pages.<br />I do agree that with a little closer analysis the books in this series are becoming a little similar plot-wise but Cornwell's talent and flair for this type of novel makes this book, like it's predecessors, a triumph.<br />Don't be put off; read this, and I hope the next chapter comes out soon. I personally can't wait to see Uhtred and his warriors forming the shield-wall in front of Bebbanburg Castle.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|I loved the action and especially Taylor Kirsh and Blake Lively. I watch all Oliver Stone movies and allthough I dont necessarly believe in his politics, I love his movies. This one was right up there with Natural Born Killers. It is well worth the rental price. It is not a movie for children at all as there is strong sexuality, drug use and heavy violence.
B0009A40ES|4.0|This is a very good movie!  Not my favorite but I absolutely love Christian Bale.  The movie was in perfect condition.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is such a cute movie!  I absolutely love it!  You should definitely purchase this for all your little ones!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson is now on my list of favorite authors and I can't wait to read the next books in this series. Characters are great and seem well developed. World and magic system has a ton of depth and history and I have just scratched the surface. Love the awesomeness of the characters while still giving them the weaknesses necessary to make them believable. Just overall awesome.<br /><br />Slowed down a little in the middle but I enjoyed it too because that's where it really explored the depth of characters and the world.<br /><br />Cannot wait for the next one.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie is worth the money don't get up and walk away because there is stuff you cant miss..  great movie

B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Bosch!  Can't wait for more!  Keep writing them Mr. Connelly..please?  Love the relationship with his daughter the most.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This movie is so good.  So inspirational.  I admit, I cried basically the entire movie.  It is based on a true story.  At the end of the movie, they show pictures of the real girl.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Great film.  Tommy Lee Jones.  Will Smith.  They still got it.  And the ending is one of the greatest endings to a film ever.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found the continuing story exceedingly captivating in concept.  There were areas which, though they didn't drag, they tended to over-tell the story.  The characters were wonderfully developed -- I found all interactions to be spot on as to the characterizations, with excellent appropriate dialogue. I still crave to know why, under the technological circumstances extant within the silo, there wasn't a single bloody elevator. Sigh.  Otherwise I'm pleasantly ensconced in the followup yarn -- which must only be read as a followup.

B004WY2M8I|3.0|Many of my family members love vampire stories and for a while it held my attention but the creepy story line is exhausting.  Didn't finish the series but loved &#34;The Vampire Lestat&#34; more than &#34;Interview with a Vampire.&#34;  Ann Rice is a good writer the descriptions are great if you are into this type of story.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a simple app that does what it should -provide some mindless entertainment to occupy ten minutes or as much time as you need to kill.
B004LQI0QK|5.0|There's always some jackass that comes along and wants to point up historical inaccuracies, or criticize the man that the movie was about... not that any of those people have accomplished anything close to what George Patton did. And accurate replicas for German Tiger tanks were kinda hard to find, even in the early 70's.<br /><br />Still, I think it's well done. And for me, I grew up thinking this movie was a primer on what being a real man was all about. Say what you think, do what you say, and to hell with what anyone else thinks about it. Now I know, we all have to live in our PC world and be in touch with everyone's feelings now. But if you want to have 3 hours of escapism from being a modern metrosexual, watch this.

B000B7BRMM|2.0|I'm a big fan of Diana Krall and can recommend her jazz albums and her concerts very highly.  But she needs to stick to jazz standards and torch songs where her smoky  voice and sultry execution are highlighted.  With perhaps a couple of exceptions, she seems uncomfortable with. . .something. . .on most of these Christmas standards.  I don't know if it's because they don't lend themselves well to jazz interpretation and almost require one to sing them in the sing-song, strictly metered rhythms, or what it is about her delivery on these, but the album is a disappointment for the most part.  I bought it because of the recommendations on Amazon, but I'm afraid this one is headed for the donation bin after Christmas is over.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|Was great, funny all the way through, don't expect anything serious from Mel,  This movie has some classic one liners and a bunch of Mel style humor good fun.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|A really nice story, portrayed well. I remember this happening on the news and really enjoyed watching it play out.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|It's my favorite game!  It reminds me, vagely, of the old pong game we played on the tv back in the 70's.  I love trying to beat my previous score.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I don't know if there ever was film music, save for the sequels to the original 1977 Star Wars, that had as much anticipation attached to it as The Hobbit. Howard Shore created a milestone with Lord of the Rings, and despite the events surrounding Jackson's King Kong, there was no question he would be on board for these films. It is quite possible, and very likely, given his passion for Tolkien, that he was playing with ideas for a possible Hobbit movie ever since he wrapped up The Return of the King.<br />Should you have asked yourself the question if themes from The Lord of the Rings would appear in The Hobbit, Howard Shore puts it to rest one minute into the album, when a plain string arrangement of the Shire theme appears in \\"My Dear Frodo\\", leading into the prologue music after the opening titles. Here, much like in Fellowship of the Ring, several main thematic threads are introduced; the most prominent being the themes for Smaug and the dwarves.<br /><br />Given the story of the films, it should be no surprise that Shore heavily expands upon the dwarven music from Lord of the Rings. \\"My Dear Frodo\\" and \\"An Ancient Enemy\\" are the most prominent examples, when the deep male chorus sings out earthshattering expansions of the dwarven harmonies, together with a new, noble theme on french horns for the great dwarf culture. While their theme in Lord of the Rings (\\"A Journey In The Dark\\") was ever downward reaching, this theme moves upward in a proud, yet already slightly resigning way. This is a major thematic thread in this score, but of course not the only one. There are themes and motifs abound.<br />The centre of the score is twofold. One is the theme \\"Misty Mountains\\", as already heard in the trailer. Written by Plan 9, it sets J.R.R. Tolkien's poem to music, and is used in a great number of variations by Howard Shore, who often applies, appropriately, dwarvish orchestrations to it. \\"Over Hill\\" would be the most complete statement of that theme, and is a true powerhouse of movie music.<br />The other main identity is Bilbo's theme(s), which can be heard in full form in \\"Dreaming of Bag-End\\" and \\"A Very Respectable Hobbit\\". \\"Dreaming Of Bag-End\\" takes the idyllic, beautifully simple, tonal harmonies of the Shire music, and adds a simply sublime melody that achieves exactly what it should: it feels warmly familiar and is yet different, depicts Bilbo's longing for his home perfectly, and sits comfortably amongst the classic Shire music from Lord of the Rings. It won't take long until you feel like you always knew that theme. \\"A Very Respectable Hobbit\\" is sort of a variation on that, and is used to great effect for example in \\"The World Is Ahead\\".<br />These two themes would be enough to warrant the waiting time for the score, but there is more. The opening music in \\"My Dear Frodo\\" reappears at the end of \\"A Good Omen\\", acting as a wonderfully lyrical musical bookmark, to open and end the film.<br /><br />There is a short but poignant motif for Gandalf, opening \\"Radagast the Brown\\", followed by haunting boys' choir, and a swirling theme for Radagast. The orcs of the Misty Mountains get a sound similar in tone to the orcs in Return of the King, but more mischievous, with lots of fluttertongue brass, and a short 3/6 notes motif. The 5/4 rhythm is back, constantly changing with 3/4 to create an absolutely exhilarating pace for \\"Under Hill\\" and \\"Brass Buttons\\", the latter complete with deep male grunting, not unsimilar in style to \\"The Bridge Of Khazad-Dum\\". There is also a characteristic short motif for the wargs. And quite a few themes are introduced here that would later become important in Lord of the Rings: Concerning Hobbits, Rivendell, Gollum's themes, Sauron's theme, some Mordor motifs, Nature's theme for the eagles and also the History of the Ring theme, which gets some fantastic variations in \\"Riddles In The Dark\\".<br /><br />The special edition soundtrack also adds \\"A Very Respectable Hobbit\\", \\"Erebor\\" and \\"The Dwarf Lords\\", which are thematic presentations of those themes. These are certainly major highlights on the album, even if they are short. \\"Erebor\\" is as adventurous as adventure music gets, spine chilling. In general, the tone of An Unexpected Journey is thoroughly more lighthearted and spirited than any of the Lord of the Rings films, since The Hobbit is a more lighthearted movie, so don't expect highly dramatic music like \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\". Don't be afraid, the music doesn't skimp with emotional highlights in all its splendour, but it puts a smile on your face instead of leaving you an emotional wreck. Howard Shore adresses the lighter nature of the film. The Hobbit music is more bouncy, the chorus airier and there is an overall more \\"active\\" quality about the music, adding more flourishes.<br />The album includes \\"The Song Of The Lonely Mountain\\", written and performed by Neill Finn, member of Plan 9. As brilliant as the score is, so dissapointing is this song. It is, to me, wholly absurd that Howard Shore, who won no less than 3 Academy Awards for Lord of the Rings (amongst them Best Original Song) was not put in charge of writing the movie's closing song. While for Fellowship of the Ring, Shore was at least Enya's orchestrator, he had no hand in this song. The end result is a jarring juxtaposition that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the album. Middle-Earth is defined by Howard Shore, it doesn't fit a song chanting \\"ayayayaaaah\\".<br /><br />From the very first second, An Unexpected Journey softly draws you into Middle-Earth by tones both familiar, yet unfamiliar, and it is simply wonderful, comforting and breathtaking at the same time to hear how Howard Shore continues to write his Middle-Earth opera, completely unimpressed and unhindered by changes and developments that took place in film music in the last 10 years, not caring about possibly being ineligible for Awards because of use of established material, seemingly driven exclusively by his own inspiration and his own ideals. For many, this music should define the term \\"swimming against the current\\". If there was a suspicion that the expansion of the films would result in a slower or less interesting score, Howard Shore puts them to rest.<br />Special mention must be made of the presentation of the score. For maybe the first time in history, a film score gets this kind of treatment upon initial release, with two discs full of music on both versions. It is, however, contrary to the Amazon description, NOT the full score from the film. Recording sessions continued after the soundtrack was finished. I would say 85 % is presented here. Included are also liner notes by Doug Adams, who already did incredible work on the LotR Complete Recordings and the book \\"The Music of The Lord of the Rings\\", describing the musical thoughts in the score, and revealing passages from the choir lyrics.  The packaging of the special edition is a catastrophe though. It's a cardboard foldout with sleeves for both discs. It is damn near impossible to pull them out without leaving fingerprints.<br />The special edition of this score includes expanded tracks, most notably \\"Radagst The Brown\\" and \\"The White Council\\", including more Necromancer and Rivendell variations. \\"Roast Mutton\\" is not only expanded on the special edition, it is also an alternate to the regular OST version. Because of these expansions, the bonus tracks and the liner notes, it is a good idea to buy the deluxe version.<br /><br />It is important to realise that Howard Shore did not reinvent the music of Lord of the Rings, he expanded it. And that was exactly his task from the beginning. You don't hear a new theme for Rivendell, you'll hear the one from Lord of the Rings. You aren't going to hear new music for Gollum, you'll hear Lord of the Rings. And that is logical because chronologically, The Hobbit sets up the themes for Lord of the Rings. Howard Shore is writing backwards, forwards. And that is fantastic. Because this is a unique opportunity to create the most coherent, thematically complex and enticing film music work of all time. And considering the quality of An Unexpected Journey, I have little doubt that when the third one is released in 2014, it will be exactly that.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I gave this book four stars it had five until the last chapter. I expected a much different ending. I hated Nick in the beginning for one reason In the end I hated him for a whole other reason.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game it's fun for the whole family! I love that I can play my neice in another state and we can message each other!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love puzzles and this one is the best I've found.  I like the way the challenge esclates.  Time passes quickly while playing.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I will not create a Spoiler, but since I read this series because my young daughter was into it at the time, I will say that I was not expecting the ending...And reading the entire series before watching the movie made the movie a total disappointment!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks does it again!  The storyline brings you into the lives of two people who meet each other during a period in their lives when they need each other without realizing it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Recommend this game to everyone or anyone who feels the need to run! I rated it a 5 cause it's fun and even my 5 yr old son loves to play he is the one who taught me how to play! LOL
B005IF7HNA|5.0|Yes it had bad/cheesy acting (from the American, no less), but it works. It's just a fun, more adult themed Doctor Who-ish show. I decided to just get the whole series, instead of buying them seperately. It's actually a well made series, with decent characters and decent effects. Worth watching, if you like your Sci-Fi on the side of different.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|THIS is the version you want to watch (1982) - it's the &#34;only&#34; one in my opinion.  Aileen Quinn, Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters and Ann Reinking - a phenominal cast.  Every kid should get to watch this at least once in their life!  Catchy songs -  and Ms. Hannigan!!
1449410243|5.0|I visit theoatmeal dot com RELIGIOUSLY and have seen some of these comics before but still enjoyed this book immensely. So much so that my neighbors (who know I live alone) were concerned by the hysterical laughter coming from my apartment.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY worth every penny.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|The music is fanatasic!  Vocals are first rate ( I didn't know Tom Cruise could sing! )  Acting is very good.  Tom Cruise is hot, hot , hot.  And I'm not a Tom Cruise fan.  This is one that I watch over and over.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Because my daughter was so hyped up over Hunger Games early in the year, I decided to take the time to read it.  Well, being pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the book, I HAD to find out what happened next, therefore I did purchase this book and read it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|He already loved it so I guess he loves it more now that he can watch any time he wants.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Ok awesome game stop complaining unless its in the game.  But we need to talk where espn put the STEELERS in a place not in the top ten.  I live espn but Comm on.

B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter will love this gift!. I received it quickly and in perfect shape! Also it was a great price!!
B0010SEMP0|3.0|That was the only reason I bought this I wasn't thrilled with the first one and still don't like Cat.  I don't know what Bones and the others see in her. Maybe she's just really pretty so her horrible personality is overlooked but really how long can that go on, so I won't continue the series.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I've had this on my phone for a while now so, I thought I would download it for my tablet. When you use it on your phone, the pictures take up the width of the screen, well it does the same thing on the tablet. Which is nice I guess, but I would prefer not to look at pictures at a 10 inch scale. I find it easier to just pull up Facebook in my tablets browser.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|The concepts discussed in the book are great.  The information is very straightforward, but the only problem I have is working in the diet concepts in a family environment.  My kids aren't going to eat the meals Tim is suggesting all the time, so it took a little bit of work trying to figure out how to accommodate both sides.
1451695195|1.0|Did this lost soul deliberately ignore the shadows behind the brilliant production he describes or did the characters in this perfect heaven successfully pull the wool over his eyes? On reaching the end of this unsatisfactory book, I found myself asking again and again: where is the \\"as above, so below\\" aspect? Many overlook that this also means: as below, so above.<br /><br />I absolutely agree with the other 1-star reviews of this book. Not only is there very little about heaven here (less than 20 out of the 200+ pages) but the author provides no proofs whatsoever - of anything. I'm astonished at over 850 glowing reviews - I can only guess that these are the same people who raved about the Ringing Cedars series of immoral fairytales.<br /><br />Eventually I understood: what this poor man experienced was a show, just like a musical but a much better production, as it engaged all the senses. In order to make something appear so perfect, others have to be working really hard in the background. The angelic characters he describes are either faking it (just like actors) or are heavily into denial.<br /><br />What he perceived is a bit like finding yourself on a perfect island resort: white-sand beaches, swaying palm trees, a gentle breeze, singing birds, lush greenery on the hillsides and clear turquoise water, lapping waves, beautiful corals and tropical fish. You can have a wonderful time with clean, ironed sheets every day and great food only because badly paid drudges living in slums are doing the dirty work.<br /><br />If you've read this far and are puzzled, I recommend the \\"Right Use of Will\\" series, which goes into detail about the parts (inside us as well as reflected outside of us) that have been judged against, controlled, disciplined, punished and denied - the seamy underside of heaven. If heaven was truly so perfect, there is no way they would leave billions to rot in the hell we have allowed to be created here while just a few thousand wear couture and, dripping in jewelery, travel by private plane to their mansions in different parts of the world - all run by slaves (anyone who MUST work is a slave) - while also heavily denying their sordid contributions to the seamy underside of the world they live in.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I was surprised of how little she thinks of women. I mean she believes women are just as good if not better in most things, in the comedy world especially, but she gives very little credit to women unless they are at the top. Maybe it's because we grew up in different times or the people we are surrounded by, but every women I know goes to the movies she wants to go to, has a spouse that is a partner, is funny and doesn't hide it, etc. Maybe she was being sarcastic in parts - but I feel that she needs to look at the younger women of today to see how far things have come. Yes, there are still women who are subordinate - but there are more women than not that are in control of their own lives. Any - off my soap box. Good book - definitely worth reading.
0439023521|4.0|I saw the movie and thought I would read the book. So far I haven't finished it yet, but I am enjoying it. There is more detail in the book then the movie, which was expected. I find it makes it a more enjoyable read. I also understand some details in the movie better now that I'm reading it. I do not want to spoil anything, I would say if you enjoyed the movie, buy the book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|what a read.  here is a man who reaches the pinnacle as a SEAL BUT THE DEPTHS OF DEPRAVITY T<br />Read what is like to be a real man in this world.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|My teenage son who has loved batman his whole life was frustrated and couldn't follow the plot.  Too much was left out and not explained. He was so disappointed, and I was too!<br />Try better next time maybe?
B0095R76EW|5.0|I liked this movie. Very funny, very real, yet still a fairytale. Anyone who has sacrificed for love and a long relationship will love this movie. Highly recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is one of my favorite non-game applications. It has weather in all forms; hourly, 10 day forecast, etc. It also has a severe weather warning, which actually gave me a Air Pollution warning the other day. My only complaint is the radar has a little trouble with the updating; it might loop from 2:30-3:15 but it's already 3:20. Although, that might be a problem with my connection. Also the rewards program is simple to use and makes it easy to get rewards.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|app is great but why isnt in Android store?<br /><br /> i went months without this before finding it by googling it.<br /><br />Asus Transformer
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I'll get to this collection soon I hope.  I love Fringe.  I still watch the TV series every week and will order it in the collections also.
B0090EKRKU|4.0|Visually pleasing and a good story. It is very political which I think is funny...I like it when mature humor and concepts are in animations.
B0095R6OBS|3.0|I saw the new one (2012) in the theater, and heard about the original. Since it was so cheap, I thought I would give it a whirl. I liked being able to watch on my TV through my PS3, but the movie was so short, only 32 minutes (I can't remember)? Although I did find it to be enjoyable.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Bought this to play with all age groups. Disappointed the scoring system does not work well. The game made us laugh at each others creations:) Needs a timer!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I've followed Fringe from the beginning, but haven't gotten to watch these yet. Looking forward to watching these as soon as possible.

B0058YPGL6|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas but he liked the first season so it should be well recieved.  I'll be buying the second season too.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|This was a wonderfully romantic movie without swearing and sex. It took a little bit to catch on to the timeline switching. Enjoyed it so much that I bought it for my chick flick collection.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift for a teacher<br />I call her Mrs Trunchbull, she has no idea what I am talking about<br />She also holds a javlin record at SIU and I have seen the movie on<br />tv it is a touching movie for adults and kids,she will get a boot out of it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works perfectly for me. It is very easy to use. I will get a lot of good use out of it, and it's free!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I had been looking for this set on DVD and could not find it only the Blu-ray set, so when we got a Blu-ray player this is the first set I bought.  Still haven't seen all the Rocky's yet but soon!!  Love the ones I have seen.  Classics!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am not into long hair music as such---but after viewing the 5 guys on a piano and watching them perform---they love doing what they do and they make the music come to life as no other performers do---I only wish that it was on DVD because seeing them perform was an ultimet treat--I bought the CD, but like I said I wish it was a DVD---tell everyone to listen with ear plug/[pieces as it gave me goose bumps when I listened to them that way---and love their suprise trip to the nursing home with Charlie Brown theme---I am a 76 yr old gal and I really dig them!!!!![[ASIN:B008XX6J4C The Piano Guys]]
B004WR125O|5.0|It works great easy set up once I disconnected my Direct TV box and hooked the receiver directly to the TV.  See my review on Onkyo TX-NR616 7.2-Channel THX Select2 Plus Certified Network A/V Receiver(Black) for some tips.
B0017I1FO4|3.0|Had listened to some of the clips and thought I would like this group. But I am disappointed, they seem to sings off-key or something.
B0058VW36U|3.0|3 Stars...It took me a few to figure it out...my star opinion.  Grandson liked it, don't recall him playing it that long. Cute though!<br /><br />I get games on my Kindle Fire for the grandsons to take turns. LOVE Nana's Kindle!<br /><br />Then again, kids can figure out anything!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I thought Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter the book was highly entertaining and borderline educational. I found myself fact checking events and becoming more interested in Lincoln's life overall. The movie, however, lacked most of the subtle nuance that made the book worthwhile. I felt the movie moved too fast sacrificing explanations for CGI action sequences. If this were a SyFy or B-horror movie, I would be fine with it. However, I expected more from what I thought was a major release.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing!!!! Need to go back and re-read to see what all I missed because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next!
B0013FYTA8|4.0|Like the humor/reality this group sings about. My son introducted me to their music so it followed to order my own CD.
B003XE1DN8|1.0|My 10 year old daughter has a slim feet and even, they don´t fit and lacerate her.<br />Very bad.<br />I buoght them thinking they were the same as the model she had before. Bad choice
B006RXSGLE|4.0|I had never seen this movie until I purchased it through Amazon Instant Video. How could I have missed it? This movie spans many grind house exploitation genres: revenge, Chambara, splatter. The story is pieced together through a series of nonlinear vignettes. Striking visuals, over-the-top characters, bloody-to-the-point-of-being-ridiculous - what isn't to love? I'm definitely excited to see Volume 2.
B008PSPNFG|4.0|It's Vai, how could it not be good? And he seems to be delving into more uncharted territory with this one. Alas, there are a couple tunes with singing - Vai singing - Steve, please don't sing. Your voice isn't that bad I suppose, but I don't want to hear you sing. That's like wanting to hear Van Gogh play the piano. He's a painter, I don't care to hear him play the piano. There was one tune with singing, I forget which one it was now, that had a very Zappa feel to it. That was a good one. Otherwise, no singing please! And the first tune is good, or it could be, I've only been able to listen to it twice. It aggravates the heck out of me. It has this Arabic chanting on it. What's up with that? I want to hear the song and not be distracted by some veiled woman chanting in another language. It takes away from the experience. Oh and the Blind Willie Johnson tune - Not necessary. Didn't like that one bit. Although I seem to be tearing him a new corn chute here, I really did like the album overall. These days good music is so hard to come by that I feel the need to embrace anything that is even slightly good for fear of losing my freaking mind with all the rehashed hip-hop out there and rancid Pop music. At least half the songs on this album were very good. Especially &#34;Velorum&#34; That one is the balls. My favorite. Many many good moments in that one. &#34;Racing the World&#34; is very good too. A complete Satriani rip-off, but good! I'm sure Joe loved that one, and I bet he wishes he could play like that. And the very last tune, I forget what it's called now, is very good too. It reminds me of &#34;Die to Live&#34; on Alien love Secrets and is one of my favorite Vai tunes. As for the rest, &#34;Gravity Storm&#34; is very unique (some of the uncharted territory I was referring to earlier) He uses his whammy bar to get this warbly effect, or maybe it isn't just the whammy bar, who knows with this guy. So overall it is a good album. Not sure it was worth the 12 year wait (I'm exaggerating, but please Steve, come out with more material, even if it sucks it's better than 99.99999999% of the cr*p out there these days in music-ville!)
030758836X|2.0|Very disappointing.  I'm still trying to \\"get through\\" it.  The author's method. i.e. switching back and forth with the main characters and not creating memorable other characters makes it difficult to identify with anyone.  I'll continue to try to make headway with the book, but I cannot understand why this novel is still on the best sellers list.
159413586X|3.0|I was initially reluctant to read this book series because of it's similarities with Battle Royale. I decided to give it a try anyways and was pulled into a great first book. I started to feel for the characters, especially Katniss, as I immersed myself into the world in the story. Throughout the first two books, I was introduced to many characters that I felt would influence the plot. Mockingjay was beautifully written for the most part. It drew me in and I really enjoyed it. I feel that maybe the ending was a bit rushed but it was a great book overall. That being said......<br /><br />MANY SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I know what I said before but it really was a rushed ending. I didnt expect a fairy tale ending. I ruled that out when I noticed the tone of the series. I expected an ending with no loose ends. Why did Rue get more mourning that Prim did. I thought that Prim was something she couldn't live without. Why did they repeatedly talk about the Avox girl when in the end, she just dies. Why did a whole adventure through the capitol to kill Snow end with only killing Coin..couldn't both have died. So many unanswered questions
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I am a big fan of Dr. Suess and intended to love the movie version of the Lorax as well.  There are very clever lines in this movie that I thought were cute and laughable - however, my four-year-old grandson who is a movie buff despite his young age was not engaged during most of the action.  For that reason, my rating is an &#34;it is OK&#34; level
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Hands down. Buy this DVD. You won't regret it. Promise. Great acting, Incredible story, cool cinematics. Just buy it already
B007HACDLK|5.0|If you like a fast paced covert action book, with a believable hero, this is the one.<br />This writer never disappoints.
B000HL2F14|5.0|This was such an exciting season.  I didn't watch live and thought the idea to do this series was not worth watching, but now that I am giving it a shot, I was astounded how addicted this season was.  I assumed the first episode would clean up the second season ending cliffhanger, but to devote the entire season to such a well developed and intricate story line that lasted the entire 24episodes was a great idea.  I didn't think I would be so addicted, but found this season to be one of the best I have seen (my disclaimer is that I have seen all of the originals, next generator, and then most of the DS9 with little of Voyager).  Now I hate that it was discontinued, but glad I would watch it all at one time becuase it would have killed me to wait to see the next episode in this season arc.
B00000IMTH|1.0|this is a remaster ? I own thousands of cd's. this is got to be one of the worst sounding discs I have ever heard or owned. The music and artists are top notch but the fidelity of this stinker ruins what I consider to be a great metal album. Do not buy this version.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you have any appreciation at all for the craft of music, these guys will knock your socks off! If you're just looking for the same four chords everyone else uses, look elsewhere. This isn't formulaic cookie-cutter crap, this is genuine MUSIC!

B0012TWRAO|4.0|Ram mounts are quality mounts. You need to compare your use and the amount of vibration to determine which ball size to use along with the weigth of the item to be mounted. The 1 inch ball are ok for lite applications. I go heavy duty just as a personal preference thus I used the 1.5 in mounting balls.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Wow, finally an author who isn't afraid of putting it out there.  I enjoyed the play and anticipation between Anna and Christian.  It held my interest from the first page, and couldn't wait to get to the other two books.  Don't read this trilogy if you don't care to read about explicit sex. For those of you who aren't afraid, and curious about how others deal with their sexuality, this trlogy is for you.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Podeis ver la pelicula en Spanish sin problema, además aunque en la caja los libros vienen en inglés se entiende perfectamente. Disfrutad del pack!

B002QGUFWE|5.0|This has got to be Gaga's best.  If you like Lady Gaga, you'll love this album.  Worth giving a listen to.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I was a little worried because most people didn't like the second book as well as the first. This one was much more of a page turner! The action heats up (pun intended) a lot more in this one. And there are so many questions unanswered by the end that my mind is spinning. I can't wait to see how Rothfuss finishes the series. Kvothe gets built up so much in this one that the third one will probably be really sad, since we already know he is going to fall very far, we just don't know why yet.<br />If you like books with compelling character development you will love this.
B000T433CO|5.0|I watched &#34;Love Actually&#34; the other week and hated it, so I wasn't expecting much from this movie. But it was so cute, and really drew me in. The perfect movie for a cuddle party with your friends, puts you in the mood for Christmas!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The thing I love the most about the Piano Guys is their ability to create unique, creative, and technically amazing pieces.  Every new song that comes out is so different from the last.  A fun twist on both modern and classic music.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|She's done it again with Fifty Shades Darker.  The continuing story of Anna and Christian as they explore their sexuality, and you learn more about both characters.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Love this book. You won't be disappointed! It took several chapters for me to really get into it but it does pick up! I love really long books so this really appealed to me. If you get bored by long books you won't like this lol.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|movie from fitting in a narrowly defined &#34;EPIC&#34; movie category.  From the perspectives of movie length and quest The Dark Knight Rises approaches epic proportions.  If some folks consider the movie Godfather to be an epic, then I would be less reluctant to include the Dark Knight into that realm.<br />The story line is rich with good vs. evil, human guilt and regret, sacrifice for the common good, greed, revenge, hope, loyalty, betrayal, hate, forgiveness, and love.  Yes people, Batman may have found a new love interest brief as it may have been.  Anne Hathaway plays Selina the cat burglar and clearly has the Batman's attention throughout the movie.  Wow, have you seen Ann Hathaway in the tight black leather or latex (I couldn't tell which) cat outfit.  Hope they make a pin up calendar of Selina.<br />The well named Bane as can be surmised is the &#34;HEAVY&#34; played by Tom Hardy.  When did Tom bulk up and morph into a entrant for Wrestlemania compared to his earlier years PR photos?  Yes people, he beats the hell out of Batman.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays officer John Blake.  We discover that John Blake and Batman attended the same orphanage.  Some of Batman's private emotions and outlook are revealed by John's &#34;5 cent Lucy&#34; pyschological profile.  John promotes from a patrolman blue uniform to an ill fitting detective suit in the movie.  Perhaps the director Nolan is telling us that John is suited for better things in the movie.<br />Christian Bale yet again is a terrific Batman.  A bit more human with aches and pains afflicting everyday humans and not comic book heros.  Did I mention Selina's outfit.....  After several years withdrawal from society, Batman emerges to confront Bane and his threatening destruction of Gotham.  Batman is heroic throughout, fearless against hopeless odds, fearless against pain, forgiving to those who betray him, and self sacrificing for Gotham.<br />Solid entertainment and worth the ticket price ....and at risk of reading too much into the movie, that we mortal humans can do better and rise beyond ourselves and self interests.ading too much into the movie, that we mortal humans can do better and rise beyond ourselves and self interests.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I was blown away by how good this book was. Piscine (Pi) Patel tells the story of a 16-year-old's spiritual coming-of-age story. An inquisitive child who is very open-minded to the idea of gaining and collecting knowledge from other faiths. Now, in his mid-fifties, he is opening up to a freelance writer about his journey adrift in the middle the Pacific ocean.<br /><br />I'll be very brief in this review: It's about a boy who believes in God, and is given every reason in the world not to.<br /><br />While I was surprised that Pi had a few disparaging words toward agnostics, I never once went into this with the idea that the reader would be swayed/convinced/converted or what have you. Some critics are taking overly-harsh offense to this, and are ranting about how insulted they feel. If you don't go in with a chip on your shoulder, you'll be able to appreciate the story for what it is.<br /><br />About the movie:<br /><br />The intellectual depth is completely lost in the film.<br /><br />The movie is very misleading. It tones down the book immensely. This book is mistakenly portrayed as a children's movie, when in fact it's much more graphic with disturbing images of despair. I would not recommend (the book) for sensitive children. You're not going to read about Auschwitz, but it's a bit too intense for kids under 11. However, it very much depends on the maturity of the child. I felt compelled to write this review (as a young adult with no children, who hates book censorship) after being disturbed by a 7-year old who couldn't wait to read this on his Kindle after getting out of the theater.<br /><br />Second, adult Pi's narrative is about AP English level. I am not entirely sure what demographic this book is aiming for (possibly 9th-12th/College Freshman), but the comprehension level is not grade-school.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have used several weather apps on my Evo 4G, and this is by far the best one for my area. I love the look of the app, and I love the 15 day &quot;predictions&quot;. I do recommend this app to my friends.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Scary for anyone who has ever been in a relationship and felt fooled by someone. This makes me appreciate my very normal relationship with my husband!!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The movies in this series are alright. The first one was a good different style to see. The second one was over rated. And this one made me down right bored wanting to fast forward through parts. Some parts of the movie just lack common sense and are pointless. One point to my thought is Batmans &#34;spaceship&#34;....yes he has one...anyways he gives a little grenade to blow a hole in a covered entrance to theunderground, it gets thrown and explodes...nothing happens...batman floats around the corner in his spaceship and shoots a rocket to blast it open...3 seconds later he is back on the ground talking....COME ON....this movie is a waste of time and money

B006R1T40I|5.0|What can anyone say about Bonnie other than what a talent. This album has aspects of all her best work. I was originally drawn to the album becasue of her remake of \\"Right Down the Line\\" originally sung by Jerry Raferty. As is usually the case I was not disappointed with the remainder of the album. She is so talented and her blues rendition of \\"Take my Love with You\\" as well as other songs on this album are spectacular. She is a gem.<br /><br />Way to go Bonnie. I love your music.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My daughter told me \\"come listen to this\\" and I was amazed. Their music is soul stirring. This is my first album but it won't be my last. Beautiful yet fun, how do they do that?
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I love Johnny Depp but the movie was a little less than I expected.<br />The movie was good but not great. Again I expected more from Depp.<br />Although I did watch it three times incase I missed something.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have loved Jon Schmidt's music for over a decade now, so I wasn't surprised at how great this album was. I have seen Steven Sharp Nelson perform with Jon many times, and he never disappoints. This album is a fantastic mixture of upbeat and soothing music. My whole family enjoys having it on in the car or around the house. One of my favorite albums I've ever owned.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A delightful tale that 's whimsical, intriguing and fast- paced. Characters sometimes border on being  caricatures, but nonetheless they are believable and add interest and richness  of the story. Google and in particular, one employee of this powerhouse of computing knowledge adds credence and excitement. I found my heart racing and fingers furiously turning pages to reach the conclusion.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|Great, though non-surprising A & R collection, with that typical (of today) flat, synthetic, non-ambience.<br /><br />Boyle's wonderful voice overcomes such adversity and yes, there are many moments in all songs where she transports the audience...and herself!<br /><br />But why does it come off, too often, like a talented amateur in a studio at the mall? While we ponder that....<br /><br />The Highlights: MEMORY, YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE.<br /><br />With Donnie Osmond on two numbers. Not Placido Domingo. Or Bonnie Raitt (representing awesome baritone-tenor, Father John). She's all a-glow in the presence of the one who is \\"a little bit country\\". (Or was it a little bit \\"rock  and roll\\"?).<br /><br />Maybe she wanted to go \\"pop\\" all along?
B004A8ZWWO|2.0|Don't buy,waste of money. Very disappointed in Ben Stiller, expected much more. Wasn't very funny at all.<br />Eddie Murphy wasn't as good as he usually is either. Who wrote this? Great actors bad picture.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book is well written, but overall it seems to be just a standard romance with lots of extra steam.  A little more than halfway through I found I was skipping through the steamy parts to get back to the story line.  The ending is abrupt, but it did its intended job of encouraging a purchase of Book 2 of the trilogy.
B005AUWY90|5.0|Bought this for my grandson for his second birthday.  He loves it.  Of course he is all boy and anything that has to do with cars he loves.
0374533571|4.0|I had not heard about THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK until it began to take the world of Oscar buzz by storm in the form of its adaptation, Silver Linings Playbook (why they dropped THE? No idea).  But you know me (well, probably not) - I am a sucker for making sure I read books before I see the adaptation, so I can generally be very disappointed and spend the rest of the day grumbling. Of course, the movie isn't even playing here, but I decided to read this one because I was bored, it was short, and I love a good psychiatric drama.<br /><br />THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the story of Pat. He's recently been released from a psychiatric facility and is determined to get back his wife, Nikki, after some apart time. His mother is coddling him, his father refuses to talk to him, and the world has changed so much since he went in. And he can't remember exactly what happened that left him in the facility. But when his best friend's sister in law enters his life, he's in for more than he ever expected.<br /><br />The adaptation of this book is sure to become an Oscar nominee (if only because Jennifer Lawrence is Hollywood's darling at the moment). In reading the book, I realized why it would make such a great movie. Although the writing is comparable to the narration of the 5 year old hero in Emma Donoghue's ROOM, the story itself is compelling, intricate, and well thought out. The story is fast paced, too - it won't take you but two or three hours to finish, and the story zips along at a great pace.<br /><br />Pat himself is a wonderful character, well conceived and built upon the foundation of having this psychiatric ailment that has left him with delusions and a bit of amnesia. Although I wish I had known more about his life before his nervous break, I made do with his diary entries, written to get back his lost wife. They were heartfelt and heartbreaking at the same time - trying to put together a life that he once had only to lose in a freak moment.<br /><br />He is surrounded with an interesting cast of family, friends, and curious onlookers. My favorite was his mother, determined to help her son put together some semblance of a life while dealing with her own troubles at home in the form of her husband. We also have Tiffany, Pat's best friend's wife's sister who has gone through her own torment after losing her husband.<br /><br />One off putting part? The romance. I didn't get it, and it seemed rather forced, like it wasn't meant to happen until the author changed his mind at the last moment and said, \\"Well, we need romance.\\" I liked the characters involved, just not the outcome.<br /><br />I am happy I read this, even if seeing the movie is a ways off since it's not playing around here. It was charming for sure, and it left me feeling a bit more hopeful that my life isn't as bad as I make it out to be, that things could always be worse. I could spend time in a psychiatric facility, for instance. And I could be stalked by a hallucination of Kenny G.<br /><br />VERDICT: Even though the romance seemed tacked on, THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a heartwarming story filled with energy and intellect for those seeking a new slice of life.rrounded with an interesting cast of family, friends, and curious onlookers.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I like how it has 3 levels you get to choose from. but the only things i didnt like so much about it, is that it gets boring afterward. it turns into a same ol boring workout video
B00785P2QC|3.0|having to buy everything is a hassle I don't like having to spend large amounts of money just to play
B009CPJHY4|4.0|We loved this movie.  It was very well-made, very interesting.  Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson were great.  The photography in India was gorgeous.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A wonderful album full of the most beautiful music.  Perfect to listen to while cleaning, studying, working, relaxing, or really anything!  I absolutely love the music and can't wait to have more albums come out. Definitely puts you in a good mood when you listen to it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i think it is a very good game for everyone<br />i also think a lot of other people will like it too<br />the only bad thing is you can't get everything right away
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love the graphics and game but get tired of pop ups....need to figure a way to allow us pop up free service....
B0086700CM|5.0|Challenging game I do admit it does get boring after awhile but my goal is to find the blue coins but I'm not sure if their are any.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly has endured as a highly readable and interesting writer throughout all of his many books.  The Black Box keeps the reader engaged and satisfied.

B00006IM9Q|1.0|Extremely disappointed! I bought this cd because I like Blondie and the cd was described as re-mastered. sound  was not good. Dont buy this cd if you want quality . Wish I could return it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great game to play easy and fun my daughter loves all the angry birds  games and free is even better
B0096BIENY|5.0|Il Divo's &#34;Greatest Hits:&#34;  My favorite singers do not disappoint-- a thorough &#34;Greatest Hits,&#34; even one from Elvis.  Many listenings required for bliss.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This one was weaker, but certainly more moving....the new, younger version of K was perfect and the very personal twist in the story line was great...but, it didn't seem to flow as smoothly as the others...I still really enjoyed watching it...it was fun...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this album.  They have taken so many wonderful songs and made them even better.  I listen to it all the time. It's great background music.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Not only did I received the package early but when I opened it, was pleasantly surprised at all the extras included within the trilogy box.  I am excited to watch all three movies and browse through the book enclosed with the set.
B0034G4OWW|5.0|A great funny movie to watch with the family. A must have if a Brendan Fraser fan.  Makes me laugh every time I watch it. Hilarious. Great music video by all at the end of the movie!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|When I heard about her death, I didn't want to jump on the band wagon like everyone else but after seeing this CD on sale and seeing all the songs on it, I knew I had to get it.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|Loved the cinematography, art, costumes, even the characters, but the story got lost in the &#34;slow-mo&#34; previews of the fight and the special effects editing, which made for a slow, rather boring story despite the many adventures, blowups and near misses by the heroes.  There were some beautiful things about the film, but not to capture me.
B003EG8YLY|3.0|I like a couple of the songs but I guess I'm just not that into country music.  It arrived on a timely basis and was in good condition.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I loved knowing what happened to my beloved Firefly voyagers!  This filled in a lot of the gaps that the canceled series never got the chance to explain.  It does contain a real shocker/game changer so you must not watch until AFTER see the complete TV series first!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This CD happened to be on sale and when I saw all the songs that were on there, I knew I had to get it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Continues the genre consistent with previous novels.  Harry never gives up on the unsolved cases he takes on and in this one he goes after the bad guys with a vengence.  Harry was a tunnel rat in the Vietnam war but shows  no mercy for some bad national guardsmen from the first Gulf war...
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I got this in a few months ago and I've got a few friends with the same item. It's a great device if you're going from place to place or a deployed individual as it holds the console your controllers and the HDMI cable is included. I've been using it for quite some time and am extremely grateful that I purchased it as it keeps me highly entertained. Note that the unit and the Xbox/PS3 take up 2 total power sockets. The screen is vivid and it looks great when playing games and watching movies.<br /><br />Downside to this and the only one I've found is that when I received mine, the screen's got what looks similar to someone making a circle with their finger but it's not removable by screen cleaner. I assume it was just damaged ever so slightly during shipping.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty awesome.
1603425381|4.0|I Love this little book!  All you need to know is how many stitches each side has and pick the border that has the look you want and it will work!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My son introduced me to the Piano Guys on youtube last year.  I have been really impressed with their wonderful music and perfomance skills.  I purchased two of these albums as soon as they came out and one is going under my son's Christmas tree this year!

B000SGRONM|1.0|Really horrible. First story is ok, but the second is disgusting and sick. Don't read this. I am sorry I paid money for it. Not funny. Wish I never read it.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case was installed on an Iphone 4 and immediately showed problems. I checked and double checked installation. Finally verified it with another Iphone.<br /><br />1. No one could hear you speak unless the charging port was open<br />2. The ringer/vibrate toggle switch was inoperable because of fitment of case.<br />3. All notification sounds were &#34;muffled&#34; or distorted from case.<br />4. Space bar and main menu button were difficult to use.<br /><br />Returned to seller and bought another through Amazon fulfillment and it works flawlessly. Buyer beware of your selling source!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|My best friend told me I should see this.  It has a lot of very powerful spiritual meaning within.  He's right.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|One of the best CD's I listened to in a long time. Very upbeat. Great music to put you in a positive mood, very mellowing.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|After reading the engrossing &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; I could hardly wait for Book 2, Winter of the World.  It's just too much.  Too many characters, too many situations and more graphic than I like.  Mr. Follett put his heart and soul into this book but his editor should've had a sharper pen.  I've had to put the book down for a spell and now fear I must start it all over again to catch up.
B0091XRTTM|3.0|Boring for myself and for my two 10 year old boys...there were a couple of good jokes, but overall not that great.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great book and I don't normally read sci fiction. Really pulls you in and keeps you up late at night to see what happens next.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|It is firm and does the job. It does not have any nuisance pockets that make no sense when for me. I am not a professional photographer, I just do this for fun at social events and what-not... So I do not need a case with extra battery, extra flashes, extra whatever... I do have one though: I have a big case for long trips though, and this one fits inside it. I swear my camera looks smaller and more compact with it on.<br /><br />There is no chance to loose the case unless I detach it all the way (there are two things I need to detach-1st velcro on one side, and a strap holder on the other). It doesn't have a strap to carry the camera with, which is great, cause my canon has one, and this semi hard case has spaces so that the strap can fit comfortably in them and you can hang it around your neck.<br /><br />I fell more safe now that I know my camera is more protected than before.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Worth the download! Fun and may get addicting.... Not like the old school oregon trail but it sure is fun!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The writers and directors were obviously striving for the &#34;real-life&#34; tone to the film.  Some of us feel the point of a super hero is the feeling of him being &#34;Super&#34;...I do enjoy Christian Bale as an actor the telling seemed flat to me.  Many of us have followed Batman from the beginning...the portrayal of Bane was weak.  The lack of a back story for Catwoman...also left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Will you see it if you are a super hero fan...yes.  Will I add it to my collection of purchased...no.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|The little girl I bought it for is just going to love it.......Tinker Bell is her favorite and now a sister to boot.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've followed The Piano Guys on YouTube for quite a while. When they finally released a physical version of their music, I was delighted. (I'm the last person in the world without any kind of MP3 player. Even my 66 year old dad has one!).<br /><br />I love all of their music and it was my incessant posting of video links on Facebook that caused my kids to fall for them too. Even my father- who is a hardcore old country fan- loves this CD.<br /><br />They blend classical with pop or new age or whatever genre. They make classical music cool. I say that as a fan of classical music. The Piano Guys seem to genuinely love what they're doing and it shows- in their videos and their music.<br /><br />As long as they keep releasing music, I'll keep buying it.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|This is a remake of a lot of classic songs.  It is well done!  Melodic!  I love Jeff Lynn's haunting melodies!
B00271SFB6|5.0|Tells an amazing back story...giving some reason for Bond being who he is.  If no one has seen a Bond film, this is a great one to get them started.

1451695195|5.0|I first heard about this book during a recent sermon by my pastor; his take on the book was that he wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I was not disappointed when I read Alexander's book, and am convinced that his mystical, spiritual journey was indeed a taste of the divine that awaits us. As a neurosurgeon, he is particularly credible in his arguments against his experience having been some sort of random short-circuiting of his brain or other neurological event, while he was in a deep coma induced by severe bacterial menigitis. The extreme rarity of his disease, the inexplicability of how he contracted it in the first place, the audacious improbability of his emergence from the coma, and the incredible fact that he had a complete recovery and was performing brain surgery 2 months after his illness are all testimony to the miraculousness of the event that interrupted Alexander's life. A few years ago, when I was very sick, I had a  mystical experience of my own, although it was different in scope and character, and much more brief than Alexander's. Nevertheless, I was profoundly affected, and overnight my condition inexplicably and dramatically improved. I was not surprised, and attributed it to my experience with the divine I had had the night before. Eventuall, many of the medical staff caring for me were convinced that a miracle had happened, because they could not otherwise explain my sudden recovery. The signature feature of my experience was one of overwhelming love; I felt embraced and permeated with a love that was greater than anything I could ever have imagined. I had no &#34;thought conversations&#34; or visions, but my experience was extremely vivid, memorable, sustaining, and effective. My recovery was real and continued. When these things happen to individuals, we want to proclaim to the whole world the wonderful news that we have nothing to be afraid of, that a loving, Higher Power exists, that we are deeply and unconditionally loved just the way we are, and that all will be well. Most folks hearing such things are skeptical, as I always was before my own encounter with the divine. I had always wanted to believe in the miraculous, but had doubt. I do not understand why some few individuals are blessed with such occurrences, but my life was changed and I am a different - and somewhat better - person in ways. I related strongly with Alexander's book and his strong need to share his experience with the world. We so easily believe in the darkness in this world even when we do not witness it ourselves; why not choose to have faith in the miraculous?we are, and that all will be well.

B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great job wrapping all the stories together.  Once again Robert Downey Jr. has done an incredible job.  It's great to see him back and delivering such amazing performances.  Full of action, very epic, to use an overused term.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Good movie in 3D. It's funny to see the kids reaction when the fish rush toward them. Highly recommend you buy it.
B000002LCX|5.0|What a great lp, so glad I bought a few days ago. I love the up beat music, with bad mood lyrics, love it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys put a unique spin on classical AND modern pop music. Their impeccable musicianship and playful creativity make each track on this CD worth listening to over and over. My whole family enjoys this album. It's the most played one on our family playlists! A great buy. Looking forward to their next album!!
B000FCKRDI|5.0|I love kleypas, and of her series, I love Wallflowers.  And of the Wallflowers, this is my favorite!  I have even purchased it in paperback and online version.<br /><br />How to sway other's that this is a good book?  The heroine has qualities that are unattractive in her day, has lived through difficulties that have given her psych issues, and she is determined to run away.  You can see the slow progression of the hero's interest, respect, and eventual love of her.  She deserves it but doesn't demand it.  There wasn't fighting between them, but there was his confusion of him becoming a refromed rake without him meaning too.  It was great to see.  I always like it when an author makes you see something develop rather than just announcing that something has happened.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Saw this movie twice in the theater and know I will watch it again. Great ending if this is the last Batman.
1449410243|5.0|Lots of humor and fun stuff that always makes my day :)<br />I read this when I have a bad day and it always cheers me up.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Puzzle game that's entertaining for kids and adults. Lots of different levels, can be challenging to get a high score.  It is definitely worth the purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this app for free and really enjoy playing. The beginning mazes are simple to solve but the further you go the harder it gets. I think this is a great way to challenge kids and a good way for more mature people to challenge their brains.
B008220B0C|5.0|I was worried that my daughter would end up wanting to color her hair blue, but that wasn't the case. It keeps kids glued to the sofa while the movie is on.... A babysitter must have!!!

B007PF7MGS|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone trying the vegan diet, or who wants to be healthy. It is easy to follow, and is informative, it inspires you to continue to live and eat healthy without being hungry.It helps you understand how easy it can be to eat healthy without searching for &#34;the right&#34; food. I wished all my loved ones would try this lifestyle for one week to see how easy it is, and how much better you feel!

B0074JODP8|5.0|I am definatley bias to this DVD because i was at this show but, i would definatley reco. this to anyone who is a Joe B. fan.  it was an awesome show. Beth Hart is the best thing on this DVD, if you are not familiar with her you should investigate her for sure. If you're into seriously good guitar playing this is it!!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|We simply adored this movie.  Great plot, great action, hate when Joss kills off beloved characters, but overall, one of the best movies to come out in a long time, even went twice to the theater, unheard of for this hillbilly
B009HEJXFS|4.0|great movie. I was skeptical since it was a movie with more than a sequal to the serries. It is a must see.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are books that you just can't put down, even if it's the third time you are reading them.  I always pick up on something I didn't catch the time before.
B005IZLPME|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised with this one.  Didn't expect a lot more than a back story plot movie, but I really enjoyed it and am glad that we added this to our collection, will enjoy for many years to come

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I love the franchise of the Alien movies, but this fell short for me.  Am looking forward to the next movies, as Aliens was better than Alien, am hoping the best is yet to come.  Will always support Sci Fi movies and the genre

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Ever since we discovered The Piano Guys we have simply fallen in love with their music.  We quickly purchased this album and have listened to it time and time again.  We listen to it at meals and in the car.  We sing bits of it when we're not listening to it.  The music is simply magnificent.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Great sounds, love the black keys.  Bought this for my son, now it lives in our truck and we look forward to road trips!

0062082353|3.0|This book was ok, although I dont feel like it was a &#34;cant put it down&#34; type of book. Had some interesting reading in it, but maybe the author was help back somewhat in what he was able to reveal.
B007SGM084|1.0|I read this because of all the hype and people telling me it was &#34;so good.&#34; I honestly thought Ana was so annoying as a character and I didn't much care for Christian either. How many times can a character say, &#34;oh my?&#34; I read all three the whole way through because I'm not one to not finish a book (and because it was all I brought to read on vacation). I read many genres of books and am not above reading a book with little meaning just for fun. But I honestly hated it.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is truly an amazing dictionary, which at first seemed basic till I continued to search for specific words I needed then it became a book that I now cannot live without. This will definitely help my children succeed in their progress as they climb to the next reading level.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|thank you so much..waited long time to get this movie 3.d. love it..blessed be..MERRY CHRISTMAS and thank you so much
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I felt like the actors were kind of phoning this one in.  It felt a bit long (and I tend to like longer movies).  For some reason I was just bored with it and wanted it to get over.  There were just so many unrealistic things going on that I could hardly watch.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I like this take on historical fiction. For someone who was not yet born during this time period, it was very interesting to me to better understand what everyday life was like for Kennedy-era Americans.
B00338QENI|5.0|There has to be so much more to this story than what was in one book.  I was astonished as I read the first few pages and continued to be more astonished as I continued to read.  I consider myself an educated person as I am an avid reader but I had never heard of Hela cells or what was accomplished using them so of course I had certainly never heard about how Henrietta's family was treated nor the horrible immoral uses of Hela.  I have to admit the world of medicine gained a lot and I don't want to give away the whole book so I'll just say I think everyone should read this book.  It's that good as a personal story and a very informational tool regarding prior and ongoing medical research, it's accomplishments and it's hopes for the future.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|This started out to be a kind of twilight zone thing.  It got we wondering how they would work their way out of it.  Then it turned into a global warming, evil capitalist, and conservatives destroyed the world. The author quoted and misinterpreted Michael Crichton to infer that man destroyed the world.  This is contrary to Crichton's positions, just read his State of Fear.  If Crouch had gone light on the reason for the situation, I might have been able to swallow it with the idea that \\"it was a stretch\\".  But the intense hammering that man destroyed the earth and caused development of alien-like creatures just turned this one sour for me.
B000FC130E|3.0|Fascinating premises, interesting characters, and a noble purpose.  Just the kind of book that could be great.  There was just enough predictability to bring it down a notch.<br /><br />A good read for lighthearted entertainment.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I decided to read this after reading Gone Girl, which I liked. I usually am not one for mysteries, but I thought I'd give this author another try. While it was somewhat disturbing, I liked the way each chapter flipped from the past to the present and that you were able to discover what really happened from different perspectives.
B0001I562I|3.0|There is an interesting backstory behind this film. Filming was started by a company called Producers Sales Organization before PSO went bankrupt. The rights were then bought up but Disney who completed the filming. This could explain a lot because it's a film that has the feel of two competing visions. When I first saw this movie I was amazed at how deftly Disney handled the plot of a 12 year old boy who suddenly and unexplainably loses 8 years of his life without aging a single day. The acting is well done and the emotions feel real. As an adult I try to imagine losing my child for 8 years. The best I could ever hope for would be to have her back at the cost of losing 8 years of her life but in the case of the Freeman's they received what they could never have hoped for, their child returned at the exact age he disappeared. It's played very well with the parents so stunned and elated by David's return that they initially don't even question the fact that he hasn't grown any older. Unfortunately this isn't a film about a child adjusting to an 8 year absence this is a film about an alien spacecraft.<br /><br />It's when David finally enters the spacecraft, at just about the midway point that things suddenly go downhill. The exact moment where the movie goes from a fascinating movie for all ages to a little kids movie may be when Max (the spacecraft's AI) tells David \\"You are THE NAVIGATOR!!!\\"  From that moment on the film completely loses its moorings. The interior design of the spacecraft is all reflective chrome and looks depressingly uncomfortable. Despite having nothing more than hard surfaces David isn't instantly killed when Max suddenly accelerates and decelerated the spacecraft. Even when I was young this seemed highly dubious. Max is an annoying thickheaded braggart and that's even BEFORE he moves into full Pee Wee Herman made. When you think things can't get any worse Max reveals a shipload of muppets. What's clear is that the first half of the movie, the GOOD half was just a setup for the second half. Ironically the ending essentially makes the second half of the movie pointless.<br /><br />I'm a big Pee Wee Herman fan from way back but there is a time a place for everything and for me using him as the voice of Max completely fails. The movie becomes obsessed with the, at the time, ground breaking reflective CGI of the spaceship but now it's just dull and repetitive seeing endless exterior shots of the spacecraft zooming around the Earth. At other times the FX are terrible as when David and Max hover over Tokyo which is nothing more than 3 asians badly green screened over a shot of an asian city. Supposedly the movie is going to be remade by Disney but I think it would be hard to recapture the things in the film that worked well. However, if I were to remake the movie I would push the spacecraft way to the back and focus on the relationship between David and his family and his adjustment to losing almost a decade while not aging in the least. Maybe show some of his friends now in their 20's. The spaceship is necessary to explain his lack of aging but in this film it just ground all the heart out of the story. If they insist on spending a significant amount of time in the spaceship at least make the interior look appealing.<br /><br />Flight of the Navigator averages 5 stars in it's Amazon reviews so clearly a lot of people see this as a flawless or near flawless movie. This COULD have been a great movie but as it stands I feel like shutting it off after the first 40 minutes. Hopefully if they do remake the film they can create more even results.GOOD half was just a setup for the second half.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is a must for anyone who got a new android update to their phone and had their ability to watch flash content and youtube taken away by google. I do not want to be forced into watching lame quality youtube mobile videos, especially since mobile youtube is missing so many videos. There's no point for android to put out a &quot;New and improved&quot; system update that is worse than the old one and blocks full youtube and flash content. Without this app my tablet would be unable to view youtube.

B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Admission: I don't have kids, I just love Pixar movies.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let me say that I did enjoy Brave, but it didn't capture my imagination like Pixar movies so often do. Where Pixar typically excels is in developing the characters so that despite the style of animation lacking realism, you connect and empathize with the characters. While Brave moves quickly, has a likable-enough protagonist, and ultimately does fine in terms of providing an hour and half of entertainment, it lacks the depth of character development that the more successful Pixar films had. In a similar fashion, I found the plot and message to be a bit flat and obvious as well.<br /><br />Pixar usually makes movies that are ostensibly for kids, but that even adults can enjoy because of the many layers contained within. I'd happily plop a niece or nephew down in front of Brave, but I might not be fighting them for the popcorn like I normally would.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|I finished the book simply because I wanted to educate myself more on the Korea's but this book was a bit boring. I struggled to get through some chapters and remember thinking at times &#34;ok ok already, let's speed this up&#34;.<br /><br />His story and meaning behind it is powerful, just told in a slower pace and dragged on a bit.
B004GXZ69W|2.0|About a year ago I bought this and an assortment of other mice in an attempt to stave off the RSI in my wrists. I use a computer daily for hours doing photoshop and animation. The price was steep, but I figured it was worth it if it fixed the pain in my wrists.<br /><br />Pro's<br />- The mouse is sturdy. It doesn't topple over when clicked or pushed.<br />- Everything functions well.<br />- Has an adjustable mouse sensitivity.<br />- fits comfortably in my hand.<br />- Reprogramming the extra buttons allowed me to use the mouse left handed or right handed with my thumb.<br />- after 6 months of use I hadn't notice, but the pain in my wrist was gone. It still shows up once in a while, but I seem to be over the hurdle.<br /><br />Con's<br />- Takes a while to get used to.<br />- My mouse started breaking down after 3 months of use. First the left click started double clicking a little and then it was a impossible to use. I switched to use Middle click as left click instead, after another 3 months it started doing the same thing.<br />- I had to use an actual mouse pad for this mouse. Not a big issue, but after a while I noticed it wasn't accurately moving the cursor. I turned the sensitivity to max and started to use a mouse pad.<br />- It helped my wrist pain, but after 6 months I started having terrible pain in my forearm and elbow. I eventually had to stop using the mouse as this pain got worse. I now have this new pain permanently.

B005NJU8PA|4.0|Good book, easy for me to read from front to back. As a profeessional cook some areas were a little slow but still learned something in each section. The author throws in enough random material to keep you interested. However the book seems geared more towards men unless your a woman who doesn't mind breaking down animals and snapping pigeons necks (in the book).
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always, couldn't wait to get this new one and read it, but it is so disappointing because I don't stop until finished and then have to wait so long for the next.  This may just be his best yet, but, at least, is one of his very best without doubt.  I am looking forward to reading his new one, co-authored with Brian Haig, in May 2013.  When seeing this, I had to read something by Mr. Haig, did so and was veyr pleased, and now have 3 or 4 more of his to read while waiting for May 2013.

0345802934|3.0|As far as Haruki Murakami novels go, \\"1Q84\\" fell short. It lacked the profundity and otherworldly beauty of the author's more iconic novels (\\"Kafka on the Shore,\\" \\"Sputnik Sweetheart,\\" \\"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\") and consists mostly of the ramblings that I find forgivable in better works. A minor character, Ushikawa, is the most developed in the novel, and we only see him fully in the final act. A few rare glimpses of Murakami's compelling gift for imagery flashes through in moments of gore and horror, as usual. I would suggest this only if you have plenty of time or you're a Murakami addict like me.<br /><br />Read my full-length reviews at LitBeetle.com!

B009WO7NQO|5.0|What a great combo.  Love Angry Birds & have been a Star Wars fan since the first movie came out many, many years ago!  Great graphics.  Love the sound!  Just started playing and I am still on the first level, but this will be great fun!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our family has been listening to The Piano Guys for awhile now, it is almost always the music of choice while we do our morning and evening milking chores.  And I swear the cows love it too!  Hardly an evening goes by that our family doesn't watch at least one of the amazing videos that they have on YouTube.  The beautiful music of The Piano Guys, the fun and freshness they add to the classical music genre is enriching our lives.  Keep up the amazing work!
B007PF7MGS|4.0|Starch......the food of the numerous millions, living &#34;far away&#34; from the &#34;first&#34; world.<br />Where they survived on it for thousands of years. So there must be some nutrition in it, wouldn't it?<br />This book tells you all of it. Good to know if you are looking for a comparison with the more &#34;common&#34; diet-theories.
B009O36EO0|5.0|I am in love with this album. For a debut album it has everything and she has everything to be a real star. Everyone in the States needs to get their hands on this album. Her vocals are amazing and it is really RARE that I buy and album and LOVE every song on it. I have been playing the entire thing in repeat for days now (my husband is annoyed). Every song has such emotion and you can't help, but love every second. I hope she has a long and great career. I know once more people in the US hear it they will be blown away and she will blow up there in so many ways.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have been throwing together instrumental remixes of popular and classical songs on YouTube for some time, and I was only too glad to learn that they'd come out with an album with many of my favorites. I only wish it could have included more of their productions.
B009JBZH54|5.0|These have to be the most important DVDs in our collection. I absolutely couldn't wait until it came out. I love it
B008M87GJK|3.0|The stories are excellent and the intial screen is customizable which is great however, if you keep the app open too long it will burn into your screen which is not good! I wish that it would refresh and be able to rotate.
B00684J49U|5.0|I fell in love with Grey's Anatomy since the first season. Loved it soo much that my fiance (at that time, now my husband) bought me the complete season 1 through season 3 as a surprised gift to me. That was a very sweet gesture on his part. I must admit that after watching season 1 through 2 and was onto season 3, I grew a little lazy to finish the dvd and lost track of Grey's on tv when the new season of Grey's started. Now eight seasons later, I'm regretting every minute of it!! I recently saw episodes after the doctors were in the plane crash and was like \\"man! what happened in previous episodes? why didn't I keep up?\\" I would always forget when Grey's would be coming on!. So I'm making it my business to purchase all of Grey's dvds from season 4 through season 8, so that I can continue where I left off. And when season 9 comes out on dvd I will get it too! I still love Grey's and I can't get enough of it!!!
B005D63ICI|5.0|yes. in season 7 it falls flat on its back but up until then this is probably one of my favorite shows of all time.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've loved these movies since I was a little girl.<br />And now my kids love them just as much as I do.
B005K17RU0|4.0|pretty good app - use it quite a bit - like the ability to have several favorite locations - good radar and seems accurate

B009FZHYKU|5.0|that 's pretty much what I say after every episode of walking dead. it is that good. it is SO good. I love zombies. I want to kill them all.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app! For a free appoints pretty cool! I mostly use it so I can wake up in the morning and it really works! Thank for glistening to my opinion and hope u like it as much as I do! (Disclaimer: This review was written by my 10 year old daughter, lol)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I just love Downton Abbey both seasons.  It started out so sweet but then just turned into a tangled Peyton Place of Britian with the different classes thrown in.  we are tickled pink and have enjoyed each character and the history being played out.  It is nice to have the DVD's to watch when we want and have gave them as gifts.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|great game way better than my little pony free fantastic I love it so much its great and super ruler goos
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I literally have stayed up until 3 in the morning on a &#34;school&#34; night watching this show. B/c ..... just one more episode....just one more episode...just another! Augh! It's so good!
B0086DBE62|3.0|I had heard this was a different story line and from previews could see that too. I enjoyed it though, it is a humorous take on the traditional story.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I grew up reading Marvel comics and really enjoy seeing their characters on the big screen.<br />Amazon makes renting and watching these movies easy.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|It truly is a mans world when phone games are primarily games about balls! As if people didn't play with their balls enough, now when we are taking a break from playing with our balls, we play with balls on our phones!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This has become my primary alarm clock.  Love the fade in feature, multiple alarm feature. The ads are unobtrusive.  Would recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I think this is fun and have enjoyed playing it. Just need my counter parts to play more often :-)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am not typically a piano or cello music listener, but that all changed after finding the Piano Guys.  Not only am I completely in love with their music, but so are my kids ages 6, 7 and 10.  Before watching the Piano Guys youtube videos my kids had no desire to play any instrument.  Now not only do they want to play, but my oldest has started playing music with his school.  I love it!  This album is wonderful, it has all the songs that we fell in love with on youtube and can now take them with us everywhere.  I highly suggest getting this.  We adore The Piano Guys!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Say what book is my favorite out I this series because they are all so stinking good :) if you have the time I would sit and read these books
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My family all love every single song written by The Piano Guys.  We love all of the videos.  This is a great CD and should be in every home.  So inspiring.  Thanks.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this has been very handy to have. good tool in working with my childrens class for different versions of the Bible
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I've tried other browsers (Firefox & Opera) on my HTC Inspire Android device and this one seems to me the most reliable.  Note that I use the Mini version.  It's still not perfect.  I would get some hang-ups now and then plus there isn't support of the flash player like the default Android browser.  I'll occasionally use the default browser if I have issue accessing certain sites.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Borat was pretty funny, Bruno was terrible, but this is by far the best. I was literally in tears watching it.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|THIS APP IS TOTS COOL GET IT GET IT!! I BEAT ALL EIGHT LEVELS THEY WERE TOT EASY.. IGNKRE THE BAD REVIEWS!! LIVE LAUGH LOVE TOTS!!!!
0307352145|4.0|Some of the other reviewers have done excellent summaries and analysis of \\"Quiet\\", so I won't try to repeat what they have done.  I just want to say this is a very worthwhile book.<br /><br />Susan Cain has helped me understand better why I am the way I am.  And, why extroverts are the way they are.  To vastly oversimplify it, we may just be wired a little differently.  We each have our own ways of reacting to the world, and so do things in different ways.  Some may see the title and think this is an anti-extrovert book.  It is not.  We need both the risk takers and the heed takers.  But, in the era of the Extrovert Ideal, the heed takers are overlooked.  The balance between introverts and extroverts has gotten out of sync.<br /><br />If \\"Quiet\\" has a drawback, it could have given some more ideas on how to restore that balance.<br /><br />So, who should read this book?<br /><br />Introverts who have been told there is something wrong with them, or who may  be unwilling to take on certain things because they think they would not be right for it.  You may just need to do those things in your own way.  Or, allow for the needed down time.<br /><br />Extroverts who may not realize that the quiet person next to them may have a lot to offer.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks the Extrovert Ideal is the only, or always best, way of doing things.  Just because everyone is following the extrovert, it doesn't mean they are always going in the right direction(although sometimes they are).
B007THA4FI|4.0|Story was wrapped up in the end....only disliked the disturbingly realistic homelife of all!  Four out of five given because of the slow start.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|If you are looking for a clever, new story line that blends mystery, antiquity, high tech, friendship, an engrossing mission, and just a little romance then this book is for you. Mr. Sloan's writing is rich and warm and I was sad when the story ended. This is a thinking book - no fist flying Jack Reacher scenes - and I found myself pausing to consider the possibilities of the story. Please write another book, Mr. Sloan.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Too sexual for even young adults.  The romance is not a good one especially for a woman.  The relationship borders on abusive.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Wonderful book, stayed up all night reading it, and this is my fifth time through this fantastic story. I can't say enough good things!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is outstanding from beginning to end. Preordered it as soon as I knew it was available, waited anxiously for its arrival and was not disappointed.  Stays on my playlist always!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic show! I can't wait for season 3. Characters are relatable, likeable. It's really interesting to see how their daily lives were. I can't wait for Season 3.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love Gideon and Eva's story. They are two broken souls because of their past looking for love. They don't always approach their relationship the correct way and they have many issues as far as trust goes but I am rooting for them. I am looking forward to the third book. I hope they get their happy ending.
B00656C6KK|5.0|A great album, the tribute to Doris Day's son Marty is a tear-jerker.  Her voice is that of an elderly woman, and her sorrow is very evident but obviously time has made it possible for her to accept the situation and share her son's talent with everyone.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a all in one camera bag. Now I can keep everything together. I recommend this bag 100% to all SLR owners.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|﻿This is a very useful file explorer. It has a lot of useful features like multi copy, search and paste
B005IQZB14|2.0|The book is not very well written, and the character is repugnant.  As I read on, i found her useless and feckless.  I began to resent her reliance on the kindness of strangers, which she seemed to feel entitled to, and accepted without any real grace.  She is a user.  I feel used paying money to read her story.  Ugh.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Just like the game in arcade, it's addicting. You can't help putting more coins in to push coins and little rewards down. You only gets certain amount of coins to play and then have to wait for a while until you have enough coins again. No big deal. However, this game doesn't give you anything else other than that. It doesn't take you to anywhere. No levels. Nothing. After playing for a week, I got bored of it.
185326895X|5.0|I got this book for my sister as a gift.  She stated that she loves these books and would recommend them to anyone who would read them.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Love Love Love Ellen and watch her show every day.  Felt like I had heard it all before. Actually found myself skipping over pages.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I'm a PD James fan, and thought this was worth my tim.e.  More fun than the 'sequal' to Gone With the Wind
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed reading. What a great storyline. Would make a great movie! Can't wait to read more from this author.
B001DCZ4IW|3.0|Time has not been kind to this classic. The color has faded in the print of this movie. The joy of watching is lessened due to washed out color. Once the film has been restored then please purchase it on dvd.
B000SW4DJO|5.0|Have always loved the movie - so far can stream, download, and play just fine on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is awesome my child and I play this game all the time thank you we love the game
B002MRRRAA|5.0|This is one of Nirvana's best live performances I have ever seen to date, and I was around when they were.  If you are a Nirvana fan, you must own this amazing performance that burns the memory of not only how beautifully artistic and talented this group was, but how Kurt Cobain will forever live in our mind and hearts...
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Movie was a little boring...I was expecting a lot more action.  Not much more really to say.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Sorry
B006O3MU96|5.0|this now should be the free app of the day near Christmas or on it make ot free fellas :)<br />please!?!!!&amp; hi
0765348276|4.0|I was drawn to this book after reading the general description of the plot. It sounded really interesting, and I think it lived up to that. I think it did a great job in staying thought-provoking and developed the main character really well. I would suggest that anyone who enjoys sci-fi literature, movies, or shows give this book a try.
B000WQW988|5.0|Even if you are not a Nirvana fan, this eclectic mix of none of their own hits, but the fact that they took their most treasured songs and exposed the vunerability of themselves to the world, Kurt Cobain is painfully wonderful to watch, must have!
B00002SSKI|5.0|I received my dvd promply and it was packed well.  The dvd has not skipped at all and had no scratches.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE The Piano Guys! They make nerd cool..er. I've seen them live, own their music and stream them on YouTube. I play the cello. My husband asked me if Steven inspired me to start using my cello as a drum.. and a quote from Dilbert came to mind. An employee is asking Wally a life-pondering question like this, and Wally replies, \\"Remember that when you reach for the stars, they're too far away, so it's hopeless.\\" To which the employee replies, \\"But sometimes you can reach a star... can't you?\\" Wally says, \\"That would burn your hand clean off.\\" So, in the interst of not burning my hand clean off, I say that Steven has inspired me to buy his music and listen to it.. a lot. As should you.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|cannot wait for the sequel to this book. the sequel was apparently written by PD James and is on my list of books to purchase.
1878424319|3.0|The ideas are wonderful, however without the depth that I was expecting in conveying them. Tolle's books have the type of depth and abstraction I am referring to.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|As I am sure that the writers struggled with the notion of bringing Beckett and Castle together, I think they would be glad to know that it did not hurt the show at all and only added to the chemistry triumph of this exquisite ensemble cast.  No jumping the shark this time guys!  Keep it up.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander made me wish I could sit and chat with him about his experience.  Loved it, loved it, loved it!!
B0041LG08U|5.0|I was really very happy with the watch, looks great, also a great price and really good value for money.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I used to watch this series as a kid. When I heard the opening music (which is awesome), I would run to the television so I could watch it. I was thrilled when I saw this was available on DVD. If you are a fan of this series, you will not be disappointed! Order it and enjoy!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I got bored of angry birds until i tried this one. I love the light saber and the laser blaster.
0618918248|5.0|this little piece of literature does it job very well. very convenient to have around the house, especially when going out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is best minecraft ever. I play all day.  zombies are epic. spiders are awesome scared of creepers.  but the best part is u pick.  creative.  survival.
1451620829|3.0|I just finished this book adn wanted to share my thoughts in a open letter to the author, Peter Criss. Growing up, I was a HUGE KISS fan (still am, but not as much). My favorite was Ace. I never cared much about Peter, nor his \\"catman\\" character. However, I read Ace's book and was disappointed with the lack of \\"juice\\" in it. So , when Peter released his book,I had to read it to \\"compare sagas\\" in those KISS years. Firstly, I didn't mind Peter Criss then, but now I don't like him at all. It is a great book--full of great stories and \\"juice\\". But all I got from the content was Peter is a sore loser, blames everyone for his troubles, and loves to throw everyone (that made him a start and lots of money) under the bus. he is  a whiner, moaner, and complainer. I actually like Gene and Paul more-so now after reading this book. Let's face it...Peter was/is a mediocre drummer. Eric Carr replaced him and blew him away on the drums. \\"Beth\\" is a mediocre song. Peter's solo album in 1978 was bad. Peter had a great voice (raspy) and could have become a great vocalist, but he chose to live a life full of drugs, booze and poor choices with money.<br />It is a great book. It really keeps your attention learning all the crazy things he did. Some of which he seems proud of. 3/4 of the  way, I was getting sick and tired of the little \\"digs\\" he threw about Gene and Paul. He complained that Gene liked to have sex with tons of girls, meanwhile Peter talks about his sex exploits. He comes across as a hypocrite, loser and plain 'ol jerk. Do what I did...buy the book--read it--sell it back.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one is excellant as always. Grisham has a way of providing detail as only someone that has lived the part can do. It makes reading his work appear to be authentic.
B008G59IBI|5.0|What a whirlwind this trilogy has been. Love it or hate it, &iexcl;UNO! gave us a refined look back at the Warning/Nimrod era sound of Green Day, and &iexcl;DOS! paid tribute to garage rock of the late 60's and 70's. Now we have &iexcl;TRE! which feels like a progression forward; beyond the days of American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown.<br /><br />The album kicks off with Brutal Love which heavily borrows from Sam Cooke's \\"Bring It On Home to Me\\", and ends with the very Beatles-esque \\"The Forgotten\\" but the ten tracks in between those shows a major departure from the heavily rock music history influenced vibe of the two preceding albums. These other songs, other than the first and last track, sound like 100% new Green Day tunes. I was delighted to discover this because, while I've enjoyed the other two albums, this one actually feels like a progression forward as musicians and artists.<br /><br />The song structure on all these tracks is very well assembled and mature. There is nothing sloppy about any of the tracks on this album. For once, Green Day sound like matured musicians who have perfected a signature sound. \\"X-Kid\\", a deep track about a friend of Billie Joe's who committed suicide, exemplifies this. You are drown in slowly with an intro of Billie's emotive lyrics, and then jump started to life with Mike and Tre's signature sound. BAM! It's a Green Day track, and you want to listen.<br /><br />I can't compare this album to other Green Day albums, and I'm really happy about that. Maybe you could compare it to 21st Century Breakdown, minus the tension of some of the lyrics, and with a more polished sound. Take the six minute \\"Dirty Rotten Bastards\\" track as an example. This may just be the finest album Green Day has written in ten years. It is unbelievably catchy and has been stuck my head for days. The last time that happened to me with a Green Day song was in the 90's. Other tracks are excellent as well though. I honestly can't pick a favorite, and the album has naturally grown on me with repeat listens. Just like the Green Day albums did for me back in the day.<br /><br />The whole experience of the trilogy has been great. I applaud Green Day for sticking their neck out and releasing this series when rock bands are not making any bold moves. They did it with American Idiot and they are doing it again by releasing three albums in one year. Who does that? Nobody else.<br /><br />There is also no denying the quality of this music across all three records. It is impressive. Could they have released one super amazing album instead of these three? Yes, but I'm glad they didn't. If they had done that, they would be just another predictable mediocre washed up rock band. Green Day said in a recent interview that they \\"Want to grow old with their fans\\", and &iexcl;Tre! shows us they are making a best effort to do just that.lly grown on me with repeat listens.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Just what I was looking for,and they had fast service. Product is as described, Will use again if and when I need the product.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you love the zombie genre, you probably have already seen this or are watching it now.  But what you may not realize, is that it is so good, even you girlfriend(or any non-zombie loving significant other) will watch it and like it!  Well written with characters you want to cheer for.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Waiting to read his 2nd Novel!!  I am looking forward to reading his next book in this series.  Go Lee Child.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The first thime I heard them was when they did the Taylor Swift's Love Story, and Coldplay's Viva la Vida.  I have been a huge fan ever since.  Recently my 3 year old grandson went to a concert, and as the music began he turned to his mommy and said \\"I want to play Cello\\"  He spends hours in front of the computer listening to \\"The Cello Guys\\" and loves it.  3 generations of my family are fans, and this album just adds to their wonderful repetoire.  Can't wait for more
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me on edge!!!!<br />I couldn't stop reading.<br />I can't wait to read book three. Seriously you just get sucked in.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|If you enjoy the ideas supernatural beings and plot twists this book is it. For someone who grew up reading Harry Potter and watching Buffy The Vampire, Charmed and Supernatural~ I was real surprised to find another book series and future movie to excite me as this book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I brought this item from Chile and it did only take two days to arrive! I really love it, ThePianoGuys are awesome! :D
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I just recently found these guys and its like I can't get enough! It's been a long time since I felt this way about musical group. The put their creative ways together and come out with the most amazing sounds!! Go to YouTube and see for yourself!  You won't be disappointed!
B008NW67IQ|5.0|These guys are true musicians and artists!  Can't wait to see them in concert.  Great CD and worth the money!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Enjoyed this lengthy mystery with twists and turns around every corner. Well written, great character development, a book I would categorize as chick lit...meaning a female would read this more than a male.<br /><br />So well written...keeps your interest until the last page! Really a good one and will read more of this author.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of any age, as it talks to everyone who's ever liked video games. There are plenty of vintage characters included - Qubert and Pac-Man, just to mention a few, as well as newer games that are holding the current generation of games hostage to their TVs.<br /><br />The story revolves around a game called Fix-It Felix Jr. and his nemesis, Wreck-It Ralph. As can be deduced from the titles, Felix Jr. is a good guy who is always fixing the damage done by a giant wrecking-ball-sized character called Ralph, who becomes jaded after 30 years of being a bad guy and getting no recognition, and leaves his game in search of adventure. Ralph finds some new friends and encounters an ancient evil in disguise. Ralph finds what he is looking for and gets to be a hero, but not in the way he thought, and in the process saves his whole world!<br /><br />This charming and engaging animated movie is targeted toward younger children, and has very friendly language (for the most part), but it also includes references and jokes that are very funny for adults too, and the message that Ralph learns while escaping his circumstances is not preachy at all, in my opinion. Did I mention a great collection of music throughout the movie, including Rhianna's &#34;Shut Up and Drive?&#34;
B008AX1HD8|5.0|After reading all the other books in the harry Hole series, it was great to find out what happened in Australia, finally!!!

0374214913|4.0|I listened to this book on audio from my library.  I often found myself smiling or laughing out loud. I thought my teens would enjoy it but waited until the end before deciding.  The ending was not monumental but good.  I will purchase it as a gift and hopefully they will laugh too.

B0091REZMW|5.0|Everyone is complaining about having to pay for diamonds, and how the app isn't free. But what they don't understand Is the game was made on Facebook first and it's meant to be played with friends and gifting to truly take advantage of it, and yes the beginning gameplay is slow but once you start to level up you'll earn diamonds and more energy,cooler quests and more objects, it's not bad but takes awhile to get going...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are a Youtube band that I have been following since the release of the Star Wars-themed 'Cello Wars' song.  Although they are titled The Piano Guys, the band is formed of one piano and one cello. The work they have released is amazing. If you're interested, you should check out their Youtube channel at [...]. Every song except 'Arwen's Vigil' is there.
