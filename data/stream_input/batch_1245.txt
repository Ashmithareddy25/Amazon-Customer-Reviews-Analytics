0553801473|2.0|If someone were to ask me what I thought about this book I would answer that it felt a bit rushed. Why? Well the lack of editing is quite noticeable and not just in the story itself, go to the end of the book on the page \\"About the Author\\" and you will find a noticeable misspell \\"every since\\" I think he meant \\"ever since\\", and just for the record I SUCK at grammar and spelling. The likely reason for this (for the editing, not my bad English)is because that while the writing of the book was slow, the editing and publishing for this book had to be done at lightning speed in order for it to be released as quickly as possible before fans burned Bantam down, and this is a BIG book without including maps, the appendix, and several author notes, the book is 956 pages long, which means a slow combing to find the smaller mistakes would take quite awhile.<br /><br />The reason I focus so much on this is because this may also be the reason the book is so bulky and could have cut down quite a bit if given time, but Martin set a release date and another delay could have meant the siege of New Mexico by readers. My guess is that Martin never really showed his editor the book much to actually edit until it was finished, which meant there was no time for it. Entire chapters of Tyrion, Dany, and Jon could have been cut or at least trimmed down. But editing is a rather slow process, that with a book this size would have taken months and that is only if Martin allowed it, if not then it could have taken years. Of course much of this book is devoted more to character development and world building, which this book and the last book seem to put great emphasis on. We finally learn more about Valyria and its doom, along with a few new things about Robert's Rebellion, and the characters develop quite a bit,<br /><br />Jon develops into more of a leader while Tyrion learns that while his life was horrible, it could have been much worse, the problem with this is that it was done at the expense of the plot. A good author is able to juggle character development, world building, and plot advancement, something Martin has proven he can do, but seems he may have forgotten. The other characters who are given chapters often seem to not be given enough, Arya only gets around two chapters, in which she does little besides train and which I suspect is little more then fan service to cater to her army of fans who would be unhappy if she did not appear. Bran got three chapters, which was okay, his plot went somewhere and ended on a rather satisfactory note, but the ones who this hurt the most was Davos, who got three chapters, the last of which was in the middle of the book and then never appears again, and Jaime, who got only one chapter and it ends on a huge cliffhanger, which seems to becoming more common these days.<br /><br />Also the problem now lies with the characters Martin has given us, or rather the ones that are left. Martin killed off most of the likeable characters, or at least the more interesting ones, the ones he has replaced them with are not nearly as likeable as the now dead ones. Then the characters that are left seem to be becoming borderline unlikeable or uninteresting, the worst of which are Dany and Tyrion.<br />With Tyrion I am finding it harder and harder to believe he is still alive and that he hasn't already died and is currently trapped in one of the seven hells. Martin seems to be finding more and more ridiculous ways to get Tyrion into and out of trouble, I know Tyrion is smart and one of your favorite characters Martin, but you have killed characters for making far less mistakes and stupid decisions then Tyrion. His entire plot can be summed up as him get caught in all sorts of troubles while trying to get to Dany in Meeren and by the end he is only OUTSIDE Meeren and has yet to meet Dany. Also in one of his chapters is a plot twist, or at least I think it is suppose to be, it is not a very believable plot twist, seeing as it has been hardly foreshadowed at all and didn't even happen at the end of the chapter, which makes it much less convincing.<br /><br />Dany spends most of the book sitting around trying to rule only to realize that ruling is not the picnic she thought it would be(her entitlement complex is still as strong as ever though). She seems to reveal a new shallowness that I never realized she had before, a Prince comes flat out offering her everything she has spent nearly the entire book series wanting in return for marriage only to turn him down, despite her most trusted counciler telling her she should do it. Her reasoning? Mostly that he doesn't look like what a prince is suppose to look like, he is not arrogant, or mean, or cruel, he was just not attractive enough for her, although this probably has something to do with her still being around sixteen years old. Only near her last chapter does the plot pick up and she actually do something, but her last chapter ends on a cliffhanger, again.<br /><br />Of the the three Jon's chapters are the most interesting, with him trying to command the Night Watch and build it up to fight the Others, but the chapters could have been cut down, but at least his actions and decisions may have some effect on the future, unlike Dany's. But here comes the bad part, it ends on one of the worst cliffhanger of the entire book, a book full of bad cliffhangers, that offers no resolution and likely will not be resolved for several years.<br /><br />Then there are the littler things, the violence, language, and sex that people say make this series 'realistic' and 'gritty', have started to become pointless and so common they have little meaning anymore, it doesn't feel realistic, it feels like Martin felt the need to add more bad language, sex, and violence because he feels that is what life is mostly comprised of. Dany's and Tyrion's chapters are particularly guilty of this, Theon's chapters are also bad, but his are justified due to there..... nature.<br /><br />Now there are some positive aspects to this book, the new maps included are very nice, we FINALLY get some maps of Essos and the old maps are far more detailed in terms of where things are and made by a new, better artist. The grammar and spelling can be overlooked as long as you don't look too hard. The Davos, Bran, Theon, and many of the Jon chapters are all very good and interesting. Martin's prose remains excellent, except for the times when he feels the need to describe things we don't need description or things we REALLY don't WANT description of. Also the worldbuilding is good and we learn more about things I have been curious about, even if it was at the expense of the plot. Most importantly it does feel like by the end that things have finally been set up for things to start moving again quickly and become more interesting, with developments I cannot WAIT to see in the next book, of course, who knows when we will see the next book.<br /><br />But here comes the killing blow, it has no climax. No Battle of the Blackwater, no battles at all really, most of the time seems to be spent preparing for battle or marching towards battle then actual battle, there is no shocking twist that changes the very landscape of the series, such as the execution of Ned Stark, the death of Joffrey, the arrest of Cersei, nothing. There is one 'death' but I doubt it will stick, in the end the world is really the same as it was at the end of the last book, which may be this book's greatest failing.

B00368PSN2|4.0|Do you like Vikings?  Did you like the Predator movies?  Do you like the Beowulf legend or any of the Beowulf movies? Then you'll love this movie, a made-in-Canada iron-age epic that incorporates elements of Predator and Beowulf.  Basically, Kainan, a warrior from outer space, crash lands on Earth, bringing with him an alien predator known as the Moorwen (the Moorwen killed his family on another planet and tagged along on the spaceship to kill his crew). That sounds simple, but there are layers to this, layers which I do not want to give away, which instill Kainan with regret and guilt. Anyway, now that he's crashed on Earth, Kainan helps the local vikings, led by the always excellent John Hurt, kill da monster. It's a simple story, so it basically boils down to the strength of the actors and the richness of the production.  It's a beautiful film, the monster is AWESOME. Everybody's covered in dirt unless they're the king or the king's daughter.  Gorgeous Sophia Myles saves this from being a total sausage fest. Ron Perlman, always a delight to watch, chews some scenery as a rival viking chieftan.  Karl Urban look-alike Jack Huston is a wonderful addition as the viking warrior Wulfar. There's even comic relief from Cliff Saunders, who plays brave, drunken Boromir.  Not a movie for young kids -- there's way too much blood and some horrific scenes of heaped bodies -- but a great movie for a cold winter night when you want to huddle around the TV with friends or loved ones.

B004A8ZWWY|5.0|\\"Tower Heist\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Queens native Josh Kovacs has managed one of the most luxurious and well-secured residences in New York City for more than a decade. Under his watchful eye, nothing goes undetected. In the swankiest unit atop Josh's building, Wall Street titan Arthur Shaw is under house arrest after being caught stealing two billion from his investors. The hardest hit among those he defrauded? The tower staffers whose pensions he was entrusted to manage.  With only days before Arthur gets away with the perfect crime, Josh's crew turns to petty crook Slide to plan the nearly impossible, to steal what they are sure is hidden in Arthur's guarded condo. Though amateurs, these rookie thieves know the building better than anyone. Turns out they've been casing the place for years, they just didn't know it.  The cast led by Ben Stiller (as Josh) & Eddie Murphy (as Slide, who was also a producer on the film) is great. The directing by Brett Ratner is great. The story by Ted Griffin, Bill Collage & Adam Cooper is great & the screenplay by Griffin & Jeff Nathanson is also great.  The music by Christophe Beck is great. The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is great. The film editing by Mark Helfrich is great. The casting by Kathleen Chopin is great. The production design by Kristi Zea is great. The art direction by Nicholas Lundy is great. The set decoration by Diane Lederman is great. The costume design by Sarah Edwards is great.  This is a great action-comedy that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat, laughing. This is a fun and entertaining movie. Ben Stiller & Eddie Murphy make a great comic duo. Brett Ratner has made a great movie that is better than some of the movies that he has done recently. This is a great movie to start the holiday season off with.

B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I haven't kept up with the Shrek series, I think I've only seen the first actually.  So knowing that this is a side story to that, I can't really comment on if it ties in with the series at all.  This is supposedly more of a life before Shrek for Puss in Boots and the adventures that he had.<br /><br />Puss as a cute young kitten is adopted by a kindly mother in charge of an orphanage.  There he meets Humpty Dumpty, although they later have a falling out in which Puss loses his honor.  But fate has something different in store for him, and when he reunites with Humpty later (and a pretty female feline named Kitty) they go on an adventure that will get the golden goose that lays the golden eggs from the top of the beanstalk.  But there are several people out to stop them, including the infamous duo of Jack and Jill.  Humpty says it will restore Puss's honor though, so he will do all it takes to get the golden goose.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Antonio Banderas: Puss in Boots<br />Salma Hayek: Kitty Softpaws<br />Zach Galifianakis: Humpty Dumpty<br />Billy Bob Thornton & Amy Sedaris: Jack and Jill<br />Walt Dohrn: Narrator<br /><br />I have to say, I thought Antonio did a great job as Puss.  The accent was very charming on him and even the little hisses and mews made were very cute.  Salma as Kitty was also a nice character although I wish she would have been more in the forefront rather than a sidekick.  Humpty Dumpty, he just freaked me out to be quite honest.  He was kind of creepy looking and a bit smarmy.  But Galifianakis did a good job on the voicing and it fit the character very well.  All the other characters were ok.  I did like Jack and Jill and the banter they had going on between them.  I think they were probably the funniest out of all of them.<br /><br />For a plot, I actually found a lot of this movie slow going and kind of boring.  Puss would go into a story and I could feel my eyes glaze over since he took so long to tell it.  There was a lot of humour shot in though and I could find myself giggling quite a bit.  Although parents should be warned that some of the jokes are kind of adult in theme.  Luckily as well the ending picked up a bit and made the movie better.  I think the main draw of this movie is probably the animation.  Lots of colors and layers, I didn't see it in 3D but all the same it was still very easy to watch and exciting visually.  The music was also very well fit to the movie.  I liked the different beats that they used and how it was good dancing music.<br /><br />Not the best movie out of the Shrek series but it had a certain charm.  This is a movie good for all ages.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011bit.  Although parents should be warned that some of the jokes are kind of adult in theme.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|For the record, I have not been a big proponent of remastering albums...it has always felt to me as nothing more than a money making scheme.  My negative opinion of remasters, however, may have just changed because of this disc.  I own the original vinyl and the first CD issue of Aqualung.  Simply put: This version blows them out of the water.  I preformed a side by side comparison of \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" from this version and the original CD version.  Sound clarity is dramatically improved.  The sound field simply feels wider.  And the bass...oh god, the bass!  Deep tones and bass drum beats where there was once only muted rhythm.  An amazing remastering job that has brought new life to this incredible album.  If you already own and enjoy \\"Aqualung\\", this is a must buy.  Coming from a guy who doesn't like the whole remastering game, that's about the biggest endorsement I can ever give.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|Awesome on blu ray! If you are a Star Wars fan it is worth your money and time. Go Star Wars!!
006112429X|5.0|Mesmerizing - not withstanding the fact that I did not particularly enjoy the style of writing (letters to her husband)the end certainly justified the means.  Those that read the book would and should definitely ponder on the pros and cons of parenthood and weigh up the supposed \\"fulfillment\\" that such a decision brings. Most parents of a wayward child would agree that the prophet, Kahlil Gibran, would have done well, instead of writing about love, to warn instead of bringing children into the world  \\"for even as they will crown you so shall they crucify you ... even as they will ascend to your height and caress your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, so shall their deeds descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.\\"  We all hope for the children that we can be proud of but the reality is in birthing them we indeed throw one of life's greatest dices.  From the slow pace of Eva's indulgent self pity wallowing (justified in the face of overwhelming odds)at not being able to connect with her son the tempo of the tragedy only really starts to gain pace as she lays bare her son's devious deeds over his formative years to the eventual devastating, gob smacking Thursday school-day.  Considering what went before, I found the final encounter between mother and her somewhat questionable but this was assuaged by the personal redemption that I perhaps needed in the exchange.  As reality most often than not proves, all too little and too late.

B001IYCMNA|2.0|In theory, this is exactly what I was looking for.  We hae a relatively small office (2000 sq ft) and only 20 clients on a flat network.  We needed something stronger than the retail store wireless routers but not a full AP/Controller solution.  Installing and configuring the unit went smoothly and all was well.<br /><br />Then came the but...at least once a day, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 times, clients would lose drop connection.  They would show still connected but no data would transferring.  The only thing that would solve it was to reboot the unit.  This occurred regardless of switch (PoE or standard) or any other configurations.  I had two of these in two different locations and they did the same thing.  Several calls to Cisco and working with their technicians were unable to figure the problem.  In the end, the only solution they had was to return the units.<br /><br />When they worked, they were great but the inconvenience to the end user made them unusable.

3442217784|5.0|This is a fantastic book and last I heard it became the best selling book of all time in its category and I can see why. It is a perfect example about how we are \\"trained\\" to think about money. One dad had a really good \\"job\\" as a school administrator and his friends dad was an entrepreneur who teaches both of them hard lessons about money.  Until I read this book I was completely lacking in one part of my \\"goal-setting\\" and this book helped me put it in perspective. Real wealth is when you have enough assets paying for your cost of living with dividends, interest or cash flow without touching the original asset. So I made a goal to have a specific dollar amount of assets spinning off a certain return and set off for the financial goal. Before this book, somehow I was not clear on something so important.<br />He also explains it to you like a third grader what the difference is between a \\"liability\\" and an \\"asset\\" which sadly, most people don't know.<br />This book is timeless and should be required reading for everyone (especially High-School kids). Seriously one of the best of all time and a must read. I have probably purchased 8 copies over time and handed them out.

B00511PTWM|5.0|This will be a great little gadget for road trips. It allows me to plug in my phone and my GPS unit at the same time. I've only used it in town so far, but I've confirmed that it charges both those devices simultaneously. On prior road trips, I had to choose which gadget to charge at any given time, so I had to be aware of which one needed juice the most. Now I don't have to juggle and switch, I can just plug in both of them at once.<br /><br />I wasn't sure that this adapter would work in my car. In \\"park\\" and \\"reverse,\\" the gear shift lever sits very close to the cigarette lighter/port. There are just a few inches of clearance. This adapter would not fit in that space when fully extended - straight out. However, when it's adjusted to about a 90-degree angle, it fits without being hit by the shift lever. The charging ports are easy to reach in that position as well.<br /><br />I like the fact that the adapter doesn't freely swivel but locks into position. It would be annoying and could be dangerous if the adapter flopped down while I was driving and blocked the path of the shift lever. I'm not sure I would try to use this adapter at all in the front cigarette lighter/power port in my car if it didn't lock in position.

B002KS1IJC|5.0|Rarely have I seen such attention to detail in a movie of this type.  Rarely do I watch a movie without working on some craft project while it's on.  Usually I love to pick movies apart for whatever ridiculous scenes, lines, and implausible situations are offered.  Not this one!    Within the first ten minutes I'd set down the needlework to give my full attention to watching the story.  Within an hour I knew I would need to own this DVD (not a common impulse for me).  Vikings - in a believable setting - and not a horned helmet in sight.  Architecture, clothing, homes, everyday items, all done with much care and it makes such a difference!  The Outlander's past history works in giving him his new fate.  A few events in the story might have been stretching things a bit, but the creature was beautifully done, the scenery was gorgeous, and the people suited their roles.  It's a work of art and I totally enjoyed it from start to finish!!  This is a movie I know I would enjoy watching more than once - an all too rare occurrence these days.
0552774391|5.0|Can you imagine to live a life, where shopping is one of the most important things?  The book follows Becky Bloomwood, the main character in Mini Shopaholic, through her adventures in shopping and life. She tries to manage family, job and her big passion, the shopping simultaneously. For her, a life without shopping is unimaginable.   Mini-Shopaholic is a novel written by the UK author Sophie Kinsella, who also writes under her real name Madeleine Wickham. Mini-Shopaholic is the sixth book of a series of novels. It was published in 2010 for the first time.   Becky and Luke Brandon are married and have a happy life with her two-year-old daughter, Minnie. But Minnie is very lively and headstrong. Minnie shares her mother's passion for shopping right now. No shopping center is safe from them. She has a preference for branded products, and if she wants something and doesn't get it, the young mother Becky often gets to her limits with Minnie. Becky's husband Luke is very anxious to have done something wrong in the education of his daughter and curtly hires a nanny. She should review the problem and should tell Luke and Becky, how they can improve the difficult situation.  But on top of everything else, Luke's beloved stepmother has died, Becky's job is in danger and a financial crisis breaks out. And no one can escape - not even Becky. Willy-nilly, she has to reduce the money spending for shopping. But she has to fight with this all the time and it's very difficult for her not to go in any shop, because for Becky, shopping is a fulfilling life.  To cheer everyone up, Becky decides to throw a surprise birthday party on a budget but then things become really complicated, because the world faces a financial crisis. She must understand that this Party cannot take place without good ideas and necessary willpower. Therefore, she's dependent on her family - her mum, her dad, her sister, her friend and Luke's secretary.   In the book the author takes us with refreshing humor andwit in the world of Becky. She has a very unique perspective on things in life which sometimes bring one to think. Becky tries to master her life in a loving, naïve, clumsy and awkward way. But she must learn to deal with different situations that sometimes overwhelmed her. Becky has a very understanding, lovable character and she has a very good knowledge of human nature. She knows exactly, how she can archive her aim in spite of the greatest problems.  First, I wasn't sure whether this book is the right one for me. But soon I couldn't stop reading it. I was very impressed by the story and in what manner it is told. I enjoyed reading the book and at no time, it was uninteresting or boring. The minor characters are sensitively and accurately described, so that one can easily imagine them metaphorically. They perfect the story and I smiled about many dialogues and behaviors. I can recommend this book to anyone who likes to read comedies and maybe a little bit recognizes itself in Becky. Fast, I could put myself in the main character Becky. I was surprised that the book conveys an important message in life - the message to fight. The author shows that it spite of many downs in life, it's worth to fight. No matter how many times you fall, you have to get up again and again. Becky is the embodiment of this fight. She lives a very normal family life and it was very interesting to see how she deals with problems. Often she was desperate and did not continue, but somehow she always has finally found a solution. Therefore, I give this book five points and I'm very excited to see how it goes on with the chaotic Becky.
B002N4DZ2G|1.0|The opera is a masterpiece, needless to say.  And this performance is a reference for everyone.  However, EMI's 2002 digital remastering is a disaster.

1617077879|4.0|Sam and Grace--will they be together forever? Isabelle and Cole--will their hard heads (and Isabelle's viper-like mouth) keep them apart or will they \\"take the plunge\\" and give in to their emotions? This final book in the Mercy Falls trilogy will keep you riveted. I highly recommend the audio version as emotions DO come through the character's voices. Maggie Stiefvater takes great care crafting her protagonists and it shows. Raw emotion, teen thought processes, silly fights--they all have a part in Stiefvater's stories. The ending left me wanting, though, not necessarily for more story but for a cleaner, more defined stop to the story. Perhaps I'm hoping for Stiefvater to pull a Scott Westerfeld trilogy, with a fourth book coming out later (OK, yes, I am!).

B005ELZKWS|4.0|This album is solid. You kinda of know what to expect, but it's still a good time. Van Halen is still much better.
B003OWVHVC|5.0|Aloe Blacc has a voice that reaches your very soul.  If you are a fan of soul music, then you should definitely buy this album.  It is an excellent debut and I look forward to following Mr. Blacc's career.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I just returned from a cinema screening of this performance, and by God, i dare say that this staging moved me more than many live musicals i've ever watched. As someone once rightly put it, Ramin Karimloo as Phantom is indeed a force of nature. His performance had me sobbing in my seat; every word, every breath, every note from this man was pure magic and pure emotion. I have not and will not ever see a better Phantom. I was lucky enough to see him in Love Never Dies at London's Adelphi Theatre and he is electrifying in both shows. Sierra Boggess, sounding equally strong and gorgeous in her lowest and highest registers, is also the best Christine i've ever seen - a perfect fit for the character in looks and voice and personality. Both invested so much emotion into their performances that you can clearly see Sierra tearing during \\"Music of the Night\\". Of course, i cannot leave out Hadley Fraser as Raoul. This is a character that i've often seen portrayed either by actors who look a little too old or those who make Raoul appear a little too naive/innocent. To me, Raoul is a subtly intelligent character with a hint of arrogance, and who is fierce, and even reckless, when provoked, and Hadley Fraser nailed it in his singing and acting. Special mention goes to Keira Duffy as Carlotta, who was suitably and comically snide without over-acting.  Even though i didn't watch this live, the performances were so spectacular that their brilliance still shone through, with the help of pretty good cinematography/camera-work. I really felt like i could've been right there in Royal Albert Hall. I felt that the significance in the feeling and meaning of the story was preserved, as the cameras certainly were not shy about going up close and personal with the actors on stage. Granted you will see things that might not be obvious if you were in the audience, e.g., a few incidences of obvious sweating, maybe even leading to running make-up, but to me, that didn't take anything away fromthis performance at all.  This DVD would be a worthwhile investment, an example of the best in arts and culture preserved for your keeping. I'm definitely getting myself one!
B000003FMY|5.0|There's not a lot more that I can add to the current pile of reviews for this legendary recording, and a perfect five star rating across a fairly large group probably speaks more than anything I could write. I will say that, not only is this a legendary recording both in terms of Reiner's conducting AND RCA's technical expertise at the time, but it is a truly sonically CLEAR recording that will yield so much nuance and detail that you'll probably have to \\"acclimate\\" your listening to it when you first play it. After a while, you'll probably see what could be done with the technical aspects of recording when someone really put their minds to it. Particularly when you consider the completely reasonable price, this is one that you should really consider adding to your collection and then go over it to see what it can do to your perceptions of recorded sound. Five stars.<br /><br />Also Consider ...<br />Compare this to the also legendary recording by Maazel and the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra on the Telarc label, which has incredible, deep, and rich sonics, at a faster pace than the Reiner piece here. Although the disc only has \\"Pictures\\" and \\"Night on Bald Mountain,\\" it's completely worth it, and in some ways, stands in contrast to the Reiner work. They are both wonderful performance and recording achievements, and are lovely to explore. See it at [[ASIN:B000003CSH Moussorgsky: Night on Bald Mountain/Pictures at an Exhibition]].
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I ordered the dockStubz from CableJive after a very disappointing eBay experience with a competing product.  I wanted to use my iPhone 4 in an Otterbox case with a docking station built into my stereo bookshelf system from Sony.  Based on the user reviews, it appeared that the dockStubz would work and those who reported problems had positive things to say about customer service.<br /><br />My dockStubz arrived within days of my order and worked perfectly for 2 weeks.  At that point, for no apparent reason, it stopped working.  I contacted CableJive by email and they quickly sent me a replacement along with a postage paid envelope to return the defective adapter.  The second adapter also failed to work.  I sent an email to Zack at CableJive to report the problem.  He once again responded quickly and offered to send an adapter that was of a new and different design.  This one arrive within days and worked perfectly.  I returned the other two adapters to CableJive in the prepaid envelope and let Zack know that the problem was solved.<br /><br />Although I was disappointed when the first adapter stopped working, I was completely satisfied with CableJive's excellent customer service.  They treated me very well with quick and clear communication and very fast action.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been using earbuds for years, but after going through several of them, I decided to get some headphones to save money long term.  Sony's MDR headphones have good bass, comfort, and overall sound quality. Also, if you're willing to turn the volume up, the design allows for good noise cancellation, even with the lack of the technology in the headphones. Definitely worth the eighty dollars as long as they last(has yet to be seen).  Also the fact that they fold up a bit is really nice for traveling.
B003L77FYS|5.0|We were put on to Castle by our son and daughter-in-law, read the first book and watched the first season on disk. We cancelled cable tv long ago and so only watch what we like a bit on line and otherwise by buying full seasons. Seasons 2 and 3 of Castle build well and we look forward to season 4. Fans of Firefly will also enjoy seeing Nathan Fillion develop his persona on this show, while occasionally having clever acknowledgements of the Firefly series. A good mystery for family viewing, the role of the daughter and mother make the show interesting on a variety of levels. (We also like Lie to Me for similar reasons).
B005LY4B0A|5.0|having so much fun playing this game. the kids love it too. love it love it love it love it.
0446573019|4.0|Baldacci burst onto the scene with \\"Absolute Power\\", followed by \\"Total Control\\", two terrific books, especially for a rookie author. In all honesty, he hasn't been able to recapture that lightning in a bottle since, and for the last few years has been grinding out the Camel Club silliness.<br /><br />But with \\"Zero Day\\" he brings us a thriller that was again one helluva good read.<br /><br />Is it a Jack Reacher knockoff? Let's take a little quiz:<br /><br />Our hero is 6'5\\", very muscular, tough, laconic, a wounded combat vet of the Middle East, a loner who works alone with the exception of a single local cop. He's an MP with an elite unit. The story takes place in a small rural town in Nowheresville, USA. The fate of the entire town hangs in the balance. His efforts are hampered by interference from \\"higher authorities\\".<br /><br />Am I describing Jack Reacher or John Puller?<br /><br />Yes!<br /><br />Even the names are a giveaway. \\"Jack\\" is a common nickname for \\"John\\". One can REACH for something, then PULL it toward them. (REACHer, PULLer).<br /><br />Baldacci wasn't even subtle about it, really. But that's okay with me, because I really like most of the Reacher books, and this one is no exception. And it's certainly a vast improvement over the Camel Club stuff.<br /><br />Now, that having been said, there are some real howlers you have to be prepared for. For example, on page 335 (hardback edition) a character is shot in the head by a sniper using a high-power rifle in .338 Lapua caliber. If you know your guns, you know that the .338 Lapua has a very long range and is a very powerful round. But as Puller examines the body, he spots the expended bullet simply laying there on the ground a couple of feet away from the body. I mean, come ON! What did it do? Go through the dead guy's head and then just stop in mid-air and fall to the ground, like Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff?<br /><br />Then on page 384 there's a scene in which Puller looks in a mirror and recalls that when he was in the ME mirrors were scarce. Well, let me tell you, mirrors aren't scarce in a combat zone; no way. Most guys had one in their kit, usually stainless steel. Signal mirrors were common, too. Guys use them regularly because they... shave! And put on face cammo! And things like that.<br /><br />ANYway...<br /><br />If you like the Reacher books, this is right up your alley.ren't scarce in a combat zone; no way.

B002C6K7N0|2.0|I wanted to love this album, and if you just listen to the music, it is one of the better Megadeth albums.  Unfortunately Dave's lyrics dont seem to pair well with the songs.  The only way I can describe the lyrics is juvenile, not quite up to Daves standards.  Also, his focus on \\"new world order\\" issues is tyring. Bush is gone Dave, we've got Jimmy Carter (part 2 - the rise of the socialist) in there now.<br /><br />My dream is that one day Dave will \\"re-do\\" this album and delete all the vocals and start over from scratch.  The music is worth it.<br /><br />I have tried to listen to this album a few times, then shelf it and later come back to it.  I just dont find it enjoyable to listen to.  The lyrics just dont fit and at times just make me cringe how poor they are.  TV dinner and a beer? Come on Dave, your better than this.<br /><br />And for the people that rate this 5 stars, come on!  \\"Rust in Peace\\" is a 5 star album, \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is a high 4 possibly 5, this is a 3 star at best!<br /><br />I hope the new album is better because the band is great.
0385344325|5.0|One of Child's best.  All the elements you' d expect: suitable violence, appropriate villains, love, a twist of plot and a special effect courtesy of the midnight train (pictured on cover).  Fans will not be disappointed.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I have always loved this video and I purchased it for my grandsons who loved it so much that they ruined 2 of them carrying them around.  As any good grandparent knows if it keeps them entertained so Mom and Dad can get some things done it is well worth the money, even if you have to purchase more than one.  While it is a romance the kids are too young to dismiss it.  The storyline is good and has a good moral to it.  Marion, Columbus, Oh.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|not the full version missing min games and the Zen garden hope they make an update for it sooner than later
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought the set despite all the negative reviews. I won't even venture into the murky morass of arguments people have made.  I own laser disc original versions of IV, V, VI which I think highly of. Still do. These are my benchmark copies for quality and having the movies as released in the theater.  I have original versions of I, II, III on DVD which are ok.  STARWARS THE COMPLETE SAGA.  If you want crisp, clear, clean copies of the movies this is a wonderful set. I am very impressed with the video and sound. I am thoroughly enjoying watching the movies again. I really do feel this release breathes some extra life into the watching. The extras and interviews are fun and informative.
0385534639|5.0|First of all, to all those that complain of poor character development, shut it. I really tried to see your point of view, but I can't. The problem is that this book isn't necessarily about all those characters. They are just parts of the main character: The Circus. The entire book is taking you on a journey of how the circus came to be and how it maintained its glory beyond the confines of its original means. If you don't understand that, then I feel very sorry for you. This isn't a normal book; The Night Circus takes you on a journey through time and imagination. It is an excellent read and I would recommend it to anyone that loves a good story because that is what this is, a good ole fashioned story.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|After many history lessons, and many books, I thought I knew everything there was to know about The Holocaust. Sarah's Key taught me a little more. Although I am not a big fan of historical fiction, I did find this book to be a compelling read, and the story line captured me so that I finished the novel in one long rainy day.
0446547654|2.0|Let me just start by saying that I anxiously await Nicholas Sparks' new books each fall. This year I was very disappointed. There is such minimal happiness in this story. Historically there is always a tragic ending or an underlying theme of sadness or dispair but nothing compares to this book. I have read every book, starting with The Notebook and I am definitely a fan of most of his novels and movies. It seems that his past few books have been a bit off track with more violence and vulgarity. I feel like he is changing his style of writing and that he is compromising how he is portrayed.I loved A Walk to Remember, The Notebook, The Last Song...and hope for more love stories like these. After all, this is how Nicholas Sparks drew so many of us to his books and developed such a strong foundation of readers. Safe Haven wasn't one of my favorites but it was definitely better than this book. It was very depressing with an ending that was filled with a bit of hope. So much of this story revolves around the deep rooted violence of Dawson Cole's family. His two cousins, Abee and Ted are on a chase for him as soon as they learn that he is back in town for the weekend. Dawson is able to briefly connect with his one and only true love from high school yet even this is heartbreaking and there actually was not one moment in the entire 292 pages that I laughed. It was definitely his most serious novel and I just would not recommend this story. I kept waiting for things to improve but that didn't happen this time. Let's hope for a more uplifting story next year that at least brings a few smiles. With that said, I did appreciate that there was a strong sense of morality and that marriage is valued not dismissed as it is in so many books.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|Fits perfectly and includes some screen films, which are ok but nothing great.  Makes you feel your phone is pretty indestructible with it on, so if that's what you're looking for you'll be really happy.  On the downside, I don't like how thick and heavy this makes the phone, as the thinness and weight are one of the main attractions of it. So I don't use it all the time, just when I will be working out in the field. When at home or work I'll just take it off.
B0009P5YXO|1.0|we are big Dr. Who fans, and wanted to get the sonic screwdrivers of the last 3 doctors, BUT.... when we went to order the 10th doctors screw driver this is the only one we found. a toy.  and a toy is just that!  it is very cheaply made and it looks it too!  we also ordered the 11th doctors screwdriver (the replica) that was very well made, and next to it, this one looks rediculous!  would return it, but that is a pain, so it stays in the drawer instead of on the shelf with the other dr. who stuff.  if you have a child that wants a toy, this would be the item for them, but if you are a collector of dr. who things, I wouldnt get this.......  its a shame they didnt make a replica of this one like they did for the 11th doctor.....
B000FC0O7M|5.0|I highly recommend this book on our space program. The author shows that our success came from the dedication of the men and women of our great nation who strived for excellence above all else.  A quality that is needed more than ever in our nation today if we are to solve our nation's problems and become the leaders in the world again.  As President Kennedy said we do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.  We need men and women like that today.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|Singers are young and not famous.  But well lessoned , expressions are super.  The story is well-known and like comic.  But Mozart gives very beautiful music like God.  Mozart's  eyes are gentle.  Such a situation   We all  do it(Cosi fan tutte),fall in love.
1594744769|3.0|I had read reviews saying this was the next big thing in children's literature so I purchased it for my kids (16 and 12), who quickly rejected it based on the cover. That meant it ended up in my book stack.  This is a very descriptive novel - not a bad thing, but it's certainly not going to be a fit for everyone in its intended audience of 10-14 year old boys. The main character spends a lot of time considering himself to be crazy and, later on, wandering around an island where his grandfather grew up. The action doesn't get going until the second half, and pretty much all the real excitement happens in the last 10 pages of the book. Also, like so many YA novels these days, the ending is a cliffhanger so clearly the author intends this to be a series. A brief appearance by a Nazi U-boat at the end foreshadows a very different type of second novel - one where the children hopefully have to more active in pursuing the bad guys.  I got the impression that this author had started with the cool photographs and really wanted to work them all into the novel. I think things would have moved along at a brisker pace if the original conceit that inspired the book hadn't been adhered to quite so faithfully. I hope the next novel begins with the story and finds art to match, rather than trying to weave the story around pre-chosen artwork.   Additionally, while this book is labeled 13 and up, most of the thoughts and dialogue of the main character read younger to me. There are themes of mental illness, romance and violence (he has to decide to shoot a gun at the end), but the dialogue and situations do not seem high school age.
0385343175|1.0|Ah, another Steel disappointment.  The first 40 pages of this boring book describes how to run a hotel (who cares?).  The characters are boring.  The single father and his daughter love, love, love the hotel.  It is their life (Steel will repeat this a hundred times), so what?  It seems Steel has run out of story lines.  Her \\"44 Charleston Street\\" book (which was disappointing as well, was about a single woman who opens her home to borders.  Now we have a hotel.  What's next, an apartment complex?  There is nothing of interest in this story.  It drags.  The characters are dull.  Steel tries to cram some drama in the end but it doesn't work.  Its time for Steel to retire.She has nothing left to write. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
1401324517|5.0|\\"Rafa\\" gives a powerful insight into the world of men's professional tennis and in particular to one of its superstars - Rafael Nadal of Spain.  The opening paragraph describes the feeling of playing on Wimbledon's Centre Court - the profound silence.  You hear the sound of your own racket hitting the ball - a cathedral hush he calls it.  The silence is broken when there is a good shot - and this audience knows the difference.  Those first few chapters set the atmosphere and are well worth reading!  And I loved all the insights into the locker room - he and Federer locked into the same little room at Wimbledon during some of the most intense periods of their professional lives.  The book starts with the marvelous 2008 Wimbledon final between Rafa and Federer and in between fills in details of his life and gradually works its way through to the year 2010 when Rafa won the U.S. Open (not much silence in that stadium!).  Rafa is definitely an unusual person - his family ties are the core of his life and affect everything he does.  By American standards, where we expect young people to move away from the family and gain their independence, he seems held back.  But this family-based lifestyle is more typical of the Spanish, particularly on his island of Mallorca and his beloved villa of Manacor.  When the family is not stable, his tennis suffers.  The insights into his training and conflict with Uncle Toni are intriguing.    As a Rafa fan, one thing I particularly enjoyed was hearing Rafa's true voice - not the limited English we normally hear from him.  Because it was co-written by John Carlin (who speaks both Spanish and English) we get to hear Rafa translated into full English and I found that very helpful.  If you have any interest in tennis or in superstar athletes, I highly recommend this book.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Fast paced high tech filmaking, superbly edited in a daring quick cut style. Daniel Craig makes an excellent and believable James Bond. Olga K is a beauty for sure and the director got a good performance out of her; in other films she comes across as wooden. The villain is appropriately slimy and lizard-esque. The action scenes are impressive and I loved the Bolivian settings.<br /><br />The only complaint is that it was quite difficult to follow the plot line, who was doing what and why. Never did grasp the nature of that shadowy evil organization.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Actually, this CD is just for fulfilling the dream of my childhood. Because in my home country I have no access to this kind of music.  I like it very much. As some previous review, it contains different branches of that style in that age.  Also, I have never thought I could use the second song as the soundtrack of my recent animation assignment.  Indeed it is from the past, but everything fits today.
080508990X|5.0|This classic is a staple in our toddler and two year old class rooms.  The two year olds are able to \\"read' this delightful story all by themselves.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|When I first realized the book was being told by a dog I was rolling my eyes for the first couple of pages (not easy to do when you're reading) but, guess what, I ended up reading it in one sitting.  The story is over the top melodramatic but it does have quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.  In the middle of some major emoting, he'll stop to describe what he had to eat and how fast he ate it.  Typical dog.  Especially liked the scene of the dog's ride on the race track.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I am reminded of a Natalie Wood interview. She was not sure that the actor playing Santa was not the real thing. She was so young when she made the film & I heard she made 2 other films at the same time. A true Christmas classic and much better in black and white. The early colorized ones were awful. Didn't see one with extras so I can't tell you about that.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Love it!  Very inspiring!  Kids who think they can't do anything because they are \\"deprived\\" should see it; they could learn a lesson and be inspired too.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started Level 1 this week. I like the simple, clean staging, where it's easy to see what the participants are doing, and it's not a crowded room like I've seen in other videos. Instructions for both the easier and the more-advanced version of the movements are very clearly demonstrated. And Level 1 is definitely a workout! I'm not so much interested in the TV persona, or how Jillian looks on the DVD cover, as some have commented here. I'm just pleased to find something that I can do in the limited free time that I have. I've performed many of these same moves before in other live classes, and Jillian's instructions are solid. I have a long way to go, but it's already making a difference in my overall strength and endurance.
B003Y5H5AG|3.0|Was a cute movie but didn't really keep their attention other than on the animated parts. More of a buy it later when its discounted price or just borrow it from a friend instead. Not a movie that is a watch multiple times. Just a once a year on a small urge to  do it
1451648537|1.0|I have read the first one-third of the book and as I read, I like it less and less.<br /><br />Among my complaints...<br />- I have had my fill and much more of negative \\"Reality Distortion Field\\" references. Please!<br />- Too much time is spent quoting disgruntled people's reactions to things purported to have been said by Steve. At times the book seems to be a hatchet job.<br />- The writing is anything but neutral. It's biased toward making Steve appear to be weird. For instance, over and over again, Steve's appearance and people's reaction to his appearance are described. OK, Walter, he didn't dress like you (or perhaps how you think people should dress). Can we move on now?<br /><br />I hope it gets better!
0312427646|1.0|Disappointing. The other reviewers must be friends of the author.There is no real plot. I suggest Queen Elizabeth sue for slander.
B000002V07|4.0|her music is so hit or miss for me. i enjoy songs like fade into you, but others just sound off key or mono tone to me.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I did not buy this toy at Amazon, where I buy most things.  However, it is one of my grandson's favorite toys.  He is almost six months old and he LOVES the mirror.  He also enjoys the flashing lights, loves to bite on it, and pushes it to make it play music.  I'm so happy I purchased this toy.  It was a hit!
B000FC1AGG|3.0|This book was light and kept my attention but I would never attempt to call it complelling literature.  It was an easy read, nothing intellectual or shocking.  In fact, it was quite predictable but will entertain you well enough.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I keep this CD in my car and play it all the time.  Great!  Such a great selection of songs and talent.  Well worth purchasing if you enjoy blues.  Hope they work together again.
B003DZX3SA|2.0|For a remastered version, this has been degraded in quality.  For fans of Disney movies, let's talk quality for a moment:  Remember the animation quality difference between \\"The Lion King\\" and \\"The Lion King 2\\"?  This remastering makes the quality more akin to that of \\"The Lion King 2\\" rather than being on par with such classics as \\"The Lion King.\\"  the colors are changed, everything is pinkish, the result is an unappealing film whereas the original was a beloved treasure.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|Looks great, everyone compliments me on how it looks on the wall.<br />It holds really well the bottles, great quality metal construction.<br /><br />Will buy again, and may also use it as a gift :)
B005VC4FLW|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I laughed and cried and then laughed some more. Having gone through similar circumstances in my life made it all the better. One thing you get by the end is that all love makes you both crazy and stupid. You won't be disappointed seeing this one. Maybe considered a bit of a chick flick but believe it or not my husband loved it every bit as much as I did.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These headphones are everything I expected.  It was described as no-fluff, which it is.  But, they're perfect for my needs.  I needed light, over-the-head headphones with earbuds for my workouts, especially when I run.  They don't budge during my workout.  The sound isn't bad either.  It's not high-quality sound, but that's not what I purchased these for.  If I want high-quality sound, I'd use my Shure or Seinheiser headphones.  I'd buy these again in a heartbeat.  In fact, I may buy a couple more as back-up.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game. Every puzzle offers a new challenge, some surprisingly easy and others surprisingly difficult. As you move through the levels, you can either simply solve the puzzle or you can choose to keep solving it until you solve it with the minimum moves. You'll find that you can't resist going back and figuring out what little move you missed.  Overall, it's not a difficult game and most anyone can eventually master it. But still, very addictive and very nicely done. The background music is soothing, but I often find myself turning it off.
0553801473|5.0|It was worth the wait; the story continues in the most magnificent way.  I am impressed with the character development as well as the fullness of this story.  It almost feels like real life because of how complex it is but at the same time, how simply readable. More please.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Love the music, even better than the first cd.  Show's the band has allot of depth to there songs and style of music they can produce.
B003AKLFAG|1.0|the movie started really distrubing but for some reason it was also hard to stop watching. It was hard to watch but even harder to stop because it seemed like there would be some closure some type of good ending or positive aspect. unfortunatelly, it just continued to get more and more disturbing and more and more dark and nerve racking.  if you one of those type who enjoys dark movies or if you don't have the stomach for all types of garbage and craziness - this movie is not for you because regardless your taste this movie is just too disturbing
B004XGN8W4|4.0|This is a really cool product that is essential for any gamer on the go. I enjoy the set-up of the G-155...but I just got mine yesterday and it was a dud. I turned it on and slipped in Mass Effect 2. What I got was a pixelated mess. The colors were distorted, basically the screen was broken. I was pissed that I spent 300 dollars to get a piece of junk less than a week before I leave on a trip. I know sometimes you get a lemon, or it has been abused during shipping, but Amazon's shipping/packaging is excellent and the box had not even a dent in it. What I believe got was poor corporate quality of the product. It's made in a 3rd World country for less and then shipped over here for us to pay a hefty price. It's the corporate inability to understand the economics of quality over quantity, both the product and the humans making it and buying it. I've bought so many electronic devices and it is a real plague of poor quality and high prices. Anyway, with that out of the way, I called Amazon and the person on the line was kind and helpful. I have until January 31st to return the broken item, that's cool, but because I have to use a different address where I'm traveling to get a new one sent to me, they had to refund me within 3-5 business days, and I had to buy a new one. So for this next week I'm out 600 dollars and no G-155. It's very much worth owning as long as it works. We'll see on the second try. :)
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is a fantastic clock app, works really well but what would make this perfect is if you could please add landscape support, it looks funny on my tablet being side ways ^^;;
B001HN6922|4.0|My kids (5 and 6) couldn't wait for Cars 2 to come out.  We went to see it in the theater as soon as it was playing and I was dissappointed.  Cars is a fantastic movie, funny, great story line - a movie the whole family can enjoy.  Cars 2 however left a lot to be desired.  It still had many of the same characters as Cars 1, but really only Mater and Lightening are focused on.  Mater accidentally becomes a secret agent and finds himself in the middle of a massive investigation.    There is a lot of violence in Cars 2 (they talk about \\"Taking Out\\" other cars, a lot of explosions  It isn't as funny as Cars 1.  My kids still liked it, but it doesn't hold their attention as the original had.    But... we still bought it because they wanted it and they have watched it many times (at least the beginning of it
B002OF5KWM|2.0|Michael Alig, James St. James and their pathetic retinue of Club Kids were nothing to celebrate, and neither is this movie.  The Club Kids were a tiny mob of useless degenerates who were celebrated primarily by a small cadre of gay columnists, nightclub publicists and shock television producers.  What they were and what they did said nothing about the New York City of their time, other than that it's a tolerant, do-your-own thing place where even scum sometimes gets its 15 minutes of fame.  As for the acting, Culkin and Greene are so over-the-top campy that quickly becomes tedious to watch.  But, then, if they didn't present the characters as virtual cartoons, you'd hate them, so I guess they had little choice - sort of like Johnny Depp presenting himself as a gay, puckish pirate, rather than a ruthless, bloodthirsty throat-cutter.  Let us not forget that Alig and St. James dealt drugs, corrupted many fragile young people and, in Alig's case, sawed the legs off a man he'd murdered and dumped his remains in the Hudson River.    I wish I could get the  1.5 hours of my life back.  But at least at didn't waste my entire life, like these narcissistic little losers.

0385344325|5.0|If you've discovered Lee Child's Jack Reacher over the years (he's written 16 of them), you've certainly wondered what inspired an intelligent man to become a hobo, walking, loving and fighting his way around the country. This book explains it all. THE AFFAIR goes back to 1997, when Reacher was still a military cop, just another soldier concerned about his job. Lee Child has answered all of our questions here, against a backdrop of murder,coverups and a little romance. I believe its Child's best Reacher book yet. And I have a strong feeling thaty he's going to keep getting better.

B0050SYS5A|2.0|This is essentially a set of lenses that snap over the Kinect sensor, to provide it with a slightly wider field of vision, which then allows people to stand a few feet closer to the television.  We have a fairly small room.<br /><br />It mostly works, but it can be finicky to get properly installed.  It comes with a \\"protective sticker\\" that one puts over the Kinect sensor to prevent scratches -- a nice touch, but requires care to get perfectly over the sensors.  Once the lenses are snapped on, if they're misaligned just a little bit, the Kinect will kind of work, but can't calibrate or see properly and its view will be \\"clipped\\" on the edges.  When properly aligned, the green light is visible, there will be a slight \\"click\\" and calibration/tuning will work.<br /><br />In practice, it seems to allow 2-3', which is all I really need, but there also seems to be a corresponding loss in precision, which I now conclude is too maddening to persevere with.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I first home tested the cd and was very happy with the sound. So I road tested it again via my in-car system on the highway and it stood up very well. With the heavy element of this band, the vocal is critical and the singer did incredibly well. I love the heaviness. With this deluxe version, the four bonus tracks are basically very good bonus songs. I prefer the cardboard casing. It reduces filing space in my cd/dvd cabinet. Now I am looking forward to a new DVD from Eva. Horns up!

0141194529|3.0|It's impossible to deny the tremendous impact this, Le Carre's breakthrough novel, had on English-reading audiences when it first appeared in 1963. Readers seized upon it because it was one of the first novels to avoid presenting espionage as glamorous: Le Carre's world is of dreary flats, shabby post-War cityscapes, and extreme loneliness (only occasionally offset by furtive middle-aged sexual couplings). The only thing that seems much alive, and presents the whole novel with its engine, are the constant mindgames practiced by the Circus (Le Carre's memorable name for MI6, the British Secret Intelligence for which he used to work) and their counterparts in the East German Stasi. The tired and jaded Alex Leamas, an agent for the former, has to undergo a long con for the Circus to pretend to be a defector to the Communist bloc; the double- and triple-crossing pioneered here have become such a part of the grammar of contemporary espionage novels ever since that it's easy to forget that Le Carre largely pioneered them here. Still, this novel's bleak view of human (and international) relations may take some getting used to today in the post-1989 world. The novel's action is pared down to mostly dialogue, trying for an extreme realism that was (and continues to be) hugely effective but is not terribly imaginatively rewarding. To complain of this spareness would be in some ways to miss Le Carre's very point; even so, it's the kind of book that works best for certain tastes.
0385523912|5.0|I bought this book because of a fascination of North Korea.  I cannot put it down and have already read half way through in one day.  Amazing how the citizens survived (and the ones who did not) in such a regime.  The stories of the defectors are so detailed and courageous.  I hope one day to visit North Korea and see it for myself.  I hope one day these people can have freedom and a sense of self.
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|I don't know which is more hysterical, this album or the horrified overreactions of Metallica fans!<br /><br />Going through the plethora of one star reviews you'd think Lou & the band just murdered their first born with Bob Dylan's Christmas in the Heart playing in the background! Get over yourselves, it's just an album. Many have said the same, if not worse about Sister Ray or Metal Machine Music.<br /><br />So, no it's not the crime against \\"Ear-manity\\" many claim.<br /><br />It's not exactly Christmas in the Heart either.<br /><br />It's pretty much as advertised: Lou Reed & Metallica collaborating on a concept album based off of Frank Wedekind's Lulu plays. I honestly don't know why people are so shocked at the results. What did they expect? The Beatles? Tony Bennett & Wilco?<br /><br />No doubt, both Reed & Metallica are getting a kick out of all the bewildered, outraged responses. As if an album about a prostitute who becomes the willing victim of Jack the Ripper is supposed be pretty, let alone Rawkin', headbangin' fun.<br /><br />True, not all risks pay off. Nor are they always meant to. It's a brutal, bleak and ultimately overwhelming listen. Much in the same way as Scott Walker's The Drift. And while Lulu may not be quite as musically \\"out there\\" as Walker's opus, lyrically it's Reed at his most adventurous and profane.<br /><br />And if the likes of Frustration leaves you feeling bludgeoned,I have a sneaking suspicion that's the intent. That said, Junior Dad is pretty powerful stuff. Without a doubt the album's most ambitious and moving track.<br /><br />Regardless of the limits of one's musical tastes, this is an undeniably passionate & inspired record. So if you want to take a risk, you'll find one here.
0307887960|5.0|Went on the diet on March 22, 2011.  Have faithfully stayed on it until today.  I had a very hard time losing weight, other than having two surgeries that made me lose weight,(not weight loss surgeries).  When I started I weighed 157, I now weigh 127.  I feel great and still walk every day (unless raining). I make my own beef jerky for my snack, but I have been making it for years, just altered how I seasoned it. I buy 5# of 90-10 ground chuck, and put the burgers on the gas grill, and have enough for a week. I use A-1 sauce on them. I also eat Dannon Oikos greek yogurt, that I flavor with the little tubes of drink mix and splenda, also I eat a lot of fat free cottage cheese.  When I go out to eat, I only eat green vegetables and baked chicken with the skin removed.  Sometimes I have a steak.  The way I eat has changed for life.  I had a starch tooth before the diet, but I never had a sweet tooth, which might be a little harder to stay on with someone who does have a sweet tooth, There are a lot of sugar free desert recipes that I fix for my husband because he had diabetes.  Thats about it, just want to thank Dr. Dukan for changing my life.

1451648537|2.0|Well, that was half a weekend I'll never get back.<br /><br />I've not read any of Issacson's other books; I'm trying to be generous when I conclude that as a biographer he was just not cut out to do research from primary sources, with the difficult subject still living and a rushed publication date.<br /><br />This biography is in the first person; the voice of the biographer in the form of an \\"I\\" or \\"me\\" intrudes at the oddest times, like a raised sidewalk brick you stub your toe on. The book eddies all over the place, jumping forward and back in time with no rhyme or reason-- sometimes paragraph to paragraph. The book attempts to be organized by theme, but that just results in an even more terribly fragmented timeline; it's not possible to get a sense of concurrency of life events/corporate events/interpersonal events.<br /><br />Pivotal incidents are raised, and then dropped, unexamined and unexplained. The whole book reads like a breathy gossip piece, interspersing hearsay and salacious stories with a pallid recounting of news events. Sadly, the Jobs we encounter in this book is two-dimensional; there is color but it's like a studio backdrop- exaggerated,  but with no graspable features and not meant to be examined closely. The book glosses over Jobs' evidently untreated mental illnesses, and does a pretty poor job of addressing adoption, as well. (Apparently, we're supposed to believe that all of Jobs' poor behaviour stems from the trauma of being \\"abandoned\\"-- more factually, the trauma of being given up for adoption-- which is rather insulting to all of those adopted children that do NOT grow up to be petulant, self-centered tyrants.)<br /><br />Issacson is also terribly out of his depth on technology, which would be forgivable if the book were otherwise good-- but is just a frustrating coda to a frustrating book.<br /><br />That's not to say that someone who just wants to read more about Steve Jobs in a conversational, anecdotal style will not enjoy it. I know many people who enjoyed the book. But you won't really glean any insight into why Jobs steadfastly refused to examine his own behaviour, why he treated so many people in his life so badly, or how he managed to inspire so many people to work so hard for him. We are told about his incredible charm, and his Reality Distortion Field, but it never really comes through.<br /><br />Finally, one of the pleasures of reading a biography of someone long-dead is that the author rarely has to pull his punches. Here, the book desperately struggles to offend none of the primary sources, even when they are in violent disagreement. The author rarely makes a judgement, but frequently says things like \\"Jobs told me this. The other guy told me that.\\" Basically, it was an awful assignment to take. A biography that attempts to offend no one will, axiomatically, please very few. Maybe we'll see a real biography in 30 years... although, I doubt Jobs' correspondence will ever make it into the public domain, so likely not. Perhaps the takeaway is that Jobs so wrapped himself in lies and mythology that no biographer could really get close to understanding the man himself.<br /><br />Thankfully, I borrowed this book rather than buying it.won't really glean any insight into why Jobs steadfastly refused to examine his own behaviour, why he treated so many people in his life so badly, or how he managed to inspire so many people to work so hard for him.

B004LROUW2|3.0|Murakami is a fantastic author, i have read all of his books. This book is good, parts of it are really are brilliant but it drags on. Its very typical murakami, but suffers from being overly long by 200-300 pages. It can be repetitive, and i felt he devoted too much time to the story of ushikawa when you really wanted more of the central plot to be revealed/discussed in depth. I agree with other reviews if you are going to read murakami this is not the book to start with. For what was supposed to be his magnum opus i was a bit disappointed, i think the wind up bird chronicle was a far better book.
0671812696|5.0|I am not Roman Catholic (in this life).  I'm not even a fan!  Still, I found this book fascinating and have great respect for the author.  I read a LOT (British classics like Trollope; contemporary fiction and non-fiction; biography, etc.)and this is one of the finest books I've read in a long time.  Hulme's writing is off-the-charts good.<br />A warning is in order, though:  if you're \\"into\\" pop culture to a great extent, and/or have no history of religious thought/struggle, you might not resonate to this book at all.  This book is about one woman's heart, soul, mind, and body (she gets sick, very sick, more than once while serving in the Congo).  It is not about sex or naughtiness.<br />Those who've remarked that the Rule of the order of nuns, which Gabrielle/Sister Luke struggled to follow, was \\"almost military\\" in its rigor -- were off the mark.  The Rule is MUCH more stringent than military order.  The Rule dictates not only details of daily life, but the workings of the mind and heart.  Also, there is no retirement, no end of your hitch, no time off to lounge in barracks.  The Rule is for \\"every day of your life, for as long as you live\\" (to quote the Mother Superior in *The Sound of Music*).<br />Author Hulme (who was the \\"companion\\" of Gabrielle after Sister Luke left the convent) managed to convey subtle ideas and feelings through her use of language, and the rhythms of thoughts, in a way which goes beyond most writing.<br />Monastic traditions go back to India, to the Hindus and then the Buddhists, who developed them further.  Monasticism was then borrowed by the Christian (Roman Catholic, primarily) church so extensively that many may imagine it was invented by that institution.  But no.  Hindus and Buddhists have beads, robes, prayer, retreats, monks and nuns too, and had them FIRST.  The challenges and pleasures of commitment to prayer and stillness are similar in all these traditions.<br />I wept numerous times while reading this book (other reviewers reacted similarly).  At the end, when Gabrielle left the convent, I could feel my mind quicken and struggle with a larger horizon along with hers.<br />I can't recommend this book too strongly to anyone who is interested in the issues with which it deals -- commitment, prayer, struggles of the spirit, and the natural tendency we have as humans to dislike some of our fellow seekers, despite our best intentions.

B004EPZ020|5.0|Paranormal Activity 3 is the best addition to the PA series since the groundbreaking first film.  As my girlfriend shook while the credits rolled, I heard nearly everyone in the theater exclaim \\"What a disappointment!\\".  I guess we were watching a different film; opening with the unfortunate Katie and pregnant Christie, an ill fated man decides to take a gander at the Blair Witch sisters' odd childhood (recorded a bit improbably on a variety of VHS tapes from the 80's which did not exist at the time.)<br /><br />As might be expected the two little girls had an unpleasant childhood.  No, no abuse, no missed meals, no glue sniffing, but something far more insidious and subtle ails the two lads. Christopher Nicolas Smith delivers a pretty good performance for a guy in a film which is videotaped with a homemade camera as does Lauren Bitner.  Daddy Dennis and Mommy Julie have got to be the unluckiest parents on earth if you forget about the whole Casey Anthony thing--anyway, without spoiling anything, we finally get to meet Grandma.  She sort of makes the film along with Toby.  [[ASIN:B003Q6D25K Paranormal Activity 2]] was not a bad movie and by necessity developed the storyline from the original; this is the reflection it needed, packing the same threadless, \\"What the Hell is Going On?\\" terror of the first.  Should there be another film? If they stay at this level of quality, yes; if the directors get bogged down in money and start making unintentional parodies, no.  I have no doubt there will be as the fate of young Hunter is unknown.<br /><br />Lesson learned pretty harshly by Dennis: get to know your in-laws before you marry.  A superb horror film.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Lou Reed is an punk/rock icon. Metallica is an influential rock band. They are also both known for performing with numerous other bands/artists with much success through the years (ie. Marianne Faithful, Bob Dylan, etc.). These are the simple facts so far. Now enter Lulu, a collaborative effort of said icon and influential band. One might expect a creation of pure strength and musical magic. This would be wrong.  Whether it is too much ego on one album, or the two sounds are just not meant to merge, Lulu is what one might call an epic fail. This is rather unfortunate, because both Lou Reed and Metallica are the best of the best, and together they should be unstoppable. Something happened along the way during the creation of this album. Their quest to be grittier and more raw turned into a seemingly pretentious mess, and is at times simply unlistenable. The barrage of noise and ridiculous lyrical banter melds together to create a sound that does not seem to have any audience. It is certainly not up to the iconic, influential standard that is expected.  The only redeemable, listenable song on the album is 'Iced Honey,' which is more in the rock-with-a-punk-edge direction one expects from the combo. It does have a nice beat and groove to it, and the lyrics aren't entirely obscure. Even at that, it is evident that Lou Reed's voice is not what it once was. True, it has never been a lyrical voice, but rather the rough punk voice that was just perfect for what he created. Sadly, it sounds too rough and abrasive to accomplish what he is trying to do now. As a band, Metallica did not do a bad job on Lulu. They do seem to be a backing band to Lou Reed's unfocused, delirious attempts, though. It feels as though the band is the afterthought, which may be a large part of the downfall of this effort.   It is proven here, that sometimes artists really want to work together, but just shouldn't. Epic collaborations can be magic. Or they can be Lulu- a disaster that is heartbreaking and saddening.

0385512058|3.0|While this book did give me some decent ideas on how to become a better networker, after a while it became difficult to slog through yet another story of Ferrazzi's self-proclaimed genius at networking.  I have read quite a few books about developing your career and most of them are chock full of examples of leading professionals, and how they embody whatever elements of leadership the author is discussing.  In this book, 95% of the examples are from Ferrazzi's own career.  I didn't so much learn about networking as I did the life and times of Keith Ferrazzi.  The irony for me is that Ferrazzi claims that one of the pitfalls people can make in networking is selling yourself too hard, yet that is what he does through most of the book.  I think his shameless self-promotion, which is contrary to the networking philosophy he supposedly espouses, really calls into question the credibility of his suggested techniques.  If it's annoying in print, I can't imagine how much worse it would be in person.

1609611543|5.0|Just through observation, clearly something went wrong in the US food supply around 30-40 years ago.  I base this statement on the observation of exponential growth in obesity, diabetes, and allergies.  The common mantra of people eating too much and not exercising enough, though true, does not explain the timing of the obesity epidemic.  The timing of the hybridization of wheat fits very well.  One of the reviewers left a comment about how uninformative the book was, because apparently everyone knows the evils of wheat and sugar.  Sugar maybe, but I don't think most people understand the evils of wheat, or I should say modern wheat, which emerged in the last 30-40 years.  If all the book does is make you aware of how truly toxic modern wheat is, and gets you to abandon wheat resulting in countless quality of life benefits, you should probably buy a copy of the book for everybody you love in your life.  And if that makes the  author a few bucks, he'll have earned and deserved every penny.   Thanks Doc.

B005K8QIS0|5.0|I am an avid watcher of Masterpiece Mystery! as are many of the other reviewers.  I won't recap the story, as it's already been told here in the reviews--but for someone who hasn't been anywhere, I loved (what I think is) the authentic sort of brogue, and I wouldn't have wanted this story Americanized and slick and edited and remastered to death;  I liked that characters LOOKED cold while they were outside, and had hair that LOOKED like they'd been rained on!   I can't stress enough how much Jason Isaacs really blew me away, and the casting really was superb.  When an actor can convey so much without a lick of dialogue or narration, well, it's a good thing indeed.  This program enthralled me and I'm looking forward to reading the book now.  I can't agree with the idea that this DVD is lacking in some way.  Any time I can watch a program and forget that I'm watching actors altogether, well I can't think it gets better than that.  I'm sorry that some folks didn't fully embrace this DVD.  I would very much like to give this to several people I know.  And to the person who thought the assistant was the only one who was funny:  there are many amusing instances in Case Histories, so you definitely missed out.
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|There are movies that make you wonder what's going on, but they do so on purpose. In this movie, I was confused from the start and obviously not on purpose. It has no actual plot just an excuse for more graphics. Where as 1st movie had some plot, the last 2  had none. Waste of time.

Oh yes, don't forget the ex-wife who left.....although I suspect she is the smartest character in this book.   Please do not waste your hard earned money.
0062068423|5.0|A dual timeline crime story is difficult to do well. The timelines need to have enough in common to be plausible, but different enough to pose a mystery. Nesbo pulls it off in the The Redbreast, a fresh take on the sardonic cop genre. Like the climate in the country they inhabit, Nesbo's characters and story have a darkness to them that is bracing, but is an exotic touch that, as a north american, I found quite intriguing.
0486284735|5.0|Pride and Prejudice.  We all know it as a timeless classic and it's difficult to review.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Thus, I'll continue.<br /><br />Lizzy Bennett: She's grown up in a humble and somewhat poor family.  The only people she really see's eye to with in her family are her father and her sister.  She's stubborn, passionate and proud of her family and life style.<br /><br />Darcy:  He's grown up in a rich family and taught that he is the best as far as social interaction.  His parents have since died and he is extremely close to his only and younger sister.  He's persistent, quiet and sure he is the highest ranking person.<br /><br />So when the two meet, they're not exactly fond of each other.  In fact, there's immediately animosity on both ends.  They don't really expect to see each other often until Darcy's best friend falls for Elizabeth's sister.  Inevitably they are brought together on numerous occasions.  And as time goes by his feeling toward her change drastically.<br /><br />I realize that I could never give the story justice.  It's classic for a reason.  Beautifully written and surprisingly easy to relate to.  It is also a great insight for the time period.  A must read.

1451648537|2.0|I've followed Jobs my entire life and have consumed whatever I could read about him.  That may be a reason why this book didn't do much for me as it doesn't really break that much new ground.  In the 580+ pages I expected more deep insight into Jobs.  Sadly getting behind the curtains of who the man really was is left to comments from others and stories about his life.  There is one quality moment in the book were Isaacson sits down with Jobs and talks about what is on his iPod.  That was the type of moment I was looking for throughout the book.  What did Jobs feel and what made him tick?  The book does a nice job telling us about the bench of talent at Apple and how jobs was more of the conductor.  This should make Apple stock holders feel better, but it does make me wonder why Jobs didn't talk more publicly about these people.  For me the book read like it was rushed.  It was long and at many times dry, repeating history that was already documented.  Someone like Robert Cringely would have done a much better job writing this book and adding some much needed insight and emotion.  No doubt Isaacson was rushed by Job's impending death, but that doesn't make up for his lack of better using the interviews he did and access to Jobs himself.
1451648537|4.0|If you're looking for insight into what it was about Steve Jobs that led to Apple's success, you probably won't find it here. Aside from the repetitive themes of: he was abandoned/he abandoned others/he was cruel/he was focused on simplicity, there isn't much insight into his character at all. This is hard to fathom given the degree of access the author had to Jobs and those around him, especially considering the extraordinary synchronization of the book with Job's death. The urgency imposed by the concurrence of those events should have inspired the author to ask deeper questions of Jobs and, perhaps, Jobs to be more revealing about his life.  The book is highly episodic and is mostly of the form: Jobs did this, then he said that. Because of the nature of his personality, the reader is inevitably led to think: \\"When do we come to the part in his life when he isn't a jerk?\\". The fact is, that never came. There is surprisingly little analysis of the events as they unfold. Perhaps that was a casualty of the effort to get the book out as soon after Jobs' death as possible. For example, the Reality Distortion Field which is cited as a reason team members excelled while being abused by Jobs is never satisfactorily explained. Successful projects such as the Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad, etc. get very little analysis into what led to their success. The book would have benefitted from examination of the paths these projects followed, similar to the examination of various business negotiations that are recounted.  This is an enjoyable read though. The reader will feel they know Jobs. But don't expect to understand him at the end of the book. For that reason it's just not as rewarding as it could have been. Also as a consequence, I can't help thinking this book will serve to make countless mediocre managers feel inspired to act as despotic martinets in the misguided belief that was the secret to Apple's success.

1856697525|2.0|A WHOLE lot of text, not very many photos, and most of them are tiny. For the price of the book, one would expect a beautiful expose of  the amazing art of Bass, instead we get art that needs a magnifying glass, and text that delves more into his life than his art. Pity.

B0042J6VUS|1.0|I had to give it one star to post a review.  It deserves No Stars.  I have bought hundreds of items from Amazon over the past 10 years and this is my first review of a product because I can't let anyone make the mistake I have made purchasing this junk. I can't believe Amazon allowed this to be sold on their website. This iPhone holder / tripod fell apart in my hands as I was loading my iPhone. It is garbage made of plastic and not up to the task, it didn't get used one time... simply fell apart.

B005Y9B5UG|5.0|I also had the opportunity to see Shakira live in Sacramento CA and wow! she doesn't need to have all the fancy stuff to make a great show! Everything she needs is her microphone and the stage. She's great! She sings, and dance and has so much energy on stage. I can't wait to see the DVD live from Paris !!!!! Btw i love the connection that she has with the crow since the entrance when she sings pienso en ti and when she picks some girls to come and dance to the stage.  Shakira you are a real artist!
B00004VXF2|1.0|I foolishly purchased this on album back when it came out in the mid-70's without reading any reviews.  Imagine my shock and utter dismay at having 2 albums of nothing resembling music at all.  Fool me once, shame on Lou.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Will not waste good money on a piece of crap CD like this.  If I could give it negative stars - it would get -5.
0446585025|2.0|I didn't even finish the book.  I read half of it and decided not to keep wasting my time.  Nothing made sense and I didn't think it was that funny.  I love her show, but not her book

B005CA4SQK|4.0|I bought this box set as I loved the T.V. show and wanted to add it to my collection of movies. And as such, this won't be a review of the T.V. show, as I figure most of you interested in the box set have either seen the show or at least some of it.  I'd like to point out that the video quality isn't up to Blu-Ray standards. By that I mean there are camera shots that are crystal clear then the scene switches to another camera and it is as grainy as an eighties T.V. show on an era correct T.V. To me, that is disappointing and points out that the show didn't have the budget for HD camera's, or something of that sort.  The extras were good and I really liked the mini documentary about the make up used and how they created a \\"Zombie School\\" to teach the extras playing zombies how to walk and move about.  Interviews with the cast and director and even Kirkman are also interesting. It was a good jumping off point for me to dive into the books (I bought the compendium after watching season one).  To summarize, the Blu-Ray set isn't worth the money in my opinion as the video quality isn't top shelf all the way through. Let's be honest, you get Blu-Ray because the video quality and sound quality matter to you and you wan that little extra. For me, if the DVD set is the same as the Blu-Ray I can't see why you'd pay the extra money and not get the extra you wanted.  I'm still happy with my purchase and would/have recommended it to quite a few friends.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Zombieland is a cool and satisfying horror/comedy flick from beginning to end. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abiligal Breslin are wonderful and very funny in their roles as the \\"non zombies\\" Parts of this film are pretty gory, if you can get through all the blood and guts then you will enjoy the rest of the film. One of the reasons I was interested in watching Zombieland is because Emma Stone is an amazing actress, she's like a young Diane Keaton. And hey, look for a very hilarious cameo appearance from Bill Murray! And I love the scenes filmed at the amusement park, this is a film definitely worth checking out. Enjoy!
0857680986|5.0|A friend of mine at work swears by this, and we've been working with this book together for several weeks now, giving ourselves homework assignments and copying the drawings.<br /><br />Andrew Loomis was truly a master of figure drawing, but more importantly, he was a fantastic teacher.  I've bought many books on drawing, from many talented artists, but as it turns out, that's not all that it takes to be a good teacher.  Mr. Loomis is clear and concise with his language.  His step-by-step approach is simple, easy to understand, and well-illustrated.<br /><br />I am an advanced artist in many respects, but reading this book is refreshing, and has proven very helpful in re-structuring and rebuilding my figure-drawing fundamentals.  Highly recommend it.
0811847365|4.0|I love this book! I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, but I love the art of Terryl Whitlatch and this was an example of her work which I didn't already own.  I was very excited to get the book and study  her drawings and display it to show friends and family.  It was ordered with another art book from amazon  so I was eligible for the super saver shipping) and they arrived in the same box.  It is unfortunate that apparently when you don't pay for shipping, they don't take care of the items sent or care about the condition of what is sent to you.  The book itself was ripped and torn on the cover and a few other pages toward the front of the book.  The box was small enough that the book had no room to move around and there was nothing that could have damaged the book while in transit.  It was put in the box by someone that knew it was damaged and just didn't care.  Sad for a constant customer of amazon to see that all they want is your money and they don't really  care about what they give you in return.

B005W3G2D4|4.0|I am a bit disappointed in the album, but have to admit that it grows on ya after listening to it a few times.  Some of the songs you have to wait for the chorus for them to get good.  I have to say that the biggest disappointment is the lack of power house ballads.  She has the voice for those amazing power ballads, but none exist on this album.  The slowest song on the album is a country song, which is good, but just not her.  The album is better and better the more I listen to it.  And there are some strong songs with strong messages and some amazing choruses.  Other than that, I feel this album is better than the last two, but nothing compared to the 10 million seller she once produced many years ago.  It's simple and nice, but nothing extraordinary.  But I will continue to buy her albums because she still has one of the best voices in the business.  My favs on the album are Dark Side and The War is Over.  Both powerful without being ballads.
B001GF7WRW|4.0|Excellent headphones, with superb sound quality.   Pros: Clear, crisp, and full sound quality. AKG definitely knows sound very well. The headphones are also extremely light and comfortable.   Cons: The K99's feel cheap to the touch, although they are far from that. This is due to their light-weight plastic structure. They are also open over-ear phones, which means they don't seal off outside sounds fully. I was personally expecting more sound isolation. Also, the cord is obnoxiously long. That proved to be slightly inconvenient.  Although I adore my AKG 99's, I would not of brought them at full price. Thus, I would not recommend purchasing them in the absence of a 20%+ discount. However, I was pleased with the product and would rate it superior in its class of mid-range, light stereo headphones.
0060512806|4.0|Cryptonomicon is a truly epic book with a lot ideas, you follow three main characters and one supporting character for just a couple of chapters.  The book uses real people and characters to really make it believable.  The book spans three characters in 1940's all involved with World War 2 and one character in precent day, which is really late 1999, but you can hardly tell.<br /><br />The best Thing Stephenson does so well is tie all these characters over many lands and time. The ending or Climax was not all that suspenseful and didn't have near conclusion I was looking for.  I felt that he didn't spend enough time on the bad guy, in a book of 900 pages he spends about thirty on the bad guy.<br /><br />That being said the journey that the book takes you on is worth the price of this book.
0062060554|5.0|Great psychological thriller!  If you like Sophie Hanna's style you will enjoy the this thinking tome.  Welcome to Christine's world ohf having no memory...you will unravel this strange mystery at the same time as the protagonist.

B000NA28I4|4.0|Yes, I read the book Eragon and was disappointed when I saw it at the movie theatre.  This was a good value for the price. Don't expect much from the movie (especially if you read the book). I bought this for my cousin and saw it to make sure it was in good condition. Also, going to finish reading the book series, so the movie helped remind me of the first book.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|After so many decades, it is incredible to hear this album in its complete form and in all (or at least MANY...!) of its evolutionary stages.  In SMiLE, Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks put together one of the most incredible pieces of music and poetry of the century.  I predict this music will be recognized as pioneering and beautiful for decades to come.  As Bruce Johnston said in his notes in the accompanying book, this music might well have been appropriate for Capitol Records' classical label, Angel Records (perhaps someday it will fall into that category... time will tell).  I recognize that many listeners will not be interested in all the out-takes and rehearsals on CD's #2, 3, 4 and 5, but as a longtime Beach Boys fan, this is fascinating listening to me.  Listening to all the various session tracks, one can really get a feel for how Brian put these songs together.  This is a rare glimpse into the creative process of a musician whose work I have loved since the early 1960s.  For those not so interested, there are a variety of options for purchasing just the basic tracks instead of the full box set.<br /><br />One thing to note: I love the 2004 version of SMiLE by Brian Wilson and his current band, and I don't view this version as competitive.  Just as good music of any kind can be performed by different musicians, beautifully, in different interpretations, this wonderful set of songs can be enjoyed immensely as performed by either band.  Because the original Beach Boys had their own gorgeous style of harmonizing, this CD set, while mixed into mono, is nevertheless as enjoyable as the 2004 album by Brian and his current band.  In short, I love both versions and recommend both.<br /><br />As for the mono mix, which some listeners have complained about, let me point out a couple things.  This was also a disappointment to me, but the mono mix was specifically chosen so as to be faithful to Brian's original vision for the album.  I agree that it would have been nice to have had BOTH a mono mix and a stereo mix, as was done for the Pet Sounds box set, but c'est la vie... Nevertheless, as some other listeners have also pointed out, the sound quality of the mono mix is excellent.  I recommend listening to it with full speakers, widely spaced in your living room, as opposed to headphones or computer speakers.  When played in this fashion, the narrow mono mix is not as apparent and the sound is glorious despite it.  In addition, the various out-takes and rehearsals are mostly in stereo, so the listener is treated to the wonderful harmonizing of the Beach Boys in beautiful, wide stereo here (e.g., track 25 of CD #1, the \\"Smile Backing Vocals Montage\\").<br /><br />The book that comes along in this box set is informative and the production notes are astonishingly detailed, almost scholarly in their specificity.  Again, this is fun stuff for Beach Boys nerds like me, but may be of lesser interest to many.  It was also fun to read the producers' notes by Mark Linett, Alan Boyd and Dennis Wolfe.  These guys are real heroes when you think about how much work was involved in putting this set together and it was clearly a labor of love for them.  The book also contains lots of photos, comments by the living Beach Boys themselves, and anecdotes by Beach Boys friends.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful box set and after so many decades of mystery, it is a joy to listen to.  To Brian and Van Dyke, thanks for this music and to all the Beach Boys, thanks for the performance.  This music is a gift of wondrous beauty.OTH a mono mix and a stereo mix, as was done for the Pet Sounds box set, but c'est la vie...

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This was a amzing and all of the extra features just makes it more amazing for me.Because I would love to learn what they did and how they did it to make this movie so phenomenal. Over all I would say buy this because its one of the best movies of that we have had in a long time.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|I remember seeing this movie at the midnight showing in the theater. As a kid I didn't really understand it, but I loved the music. As an adult and a huge Floyd fan, this brings back wonderful memories. It's very well done. I also enjoyed the interviews and special features that weren't part of the movie in the theater. This is a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan as well as any alternative rock fan.

0439023513|4.0|I'm actually still processing this book. So, having said that, here are my two main responses to it. No spoilers ;)<br /><br />1. I loved it. Also, I hated it. Like I said, I'm still processing. I read it all at once. I HAD to know how it ended. There were parts where I thought, \\"YES! That is exactly how it should be!\\" There were also parts that as I read them I thought, \\"I'm going to pretend that didn't just happen.\\" When I was done I just sat there thinking. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. There was so much that I had to think about and connect. Things I didn't like at first I came to understand after mentally arguing out how I wanted it to be. I'm pretty sure I barely slept that night. Every time I tried to do something else Mockingjay would come back to haunt my thoughts. Haunting, that's exactly what it was.<br /><br />2. It ended exactly how I wanted it to and not at all how I wanted it to. I can't go in to too much detail here with out spoiling it. I'll just say this... while the outcome was what I had hoped for, everything that got the characters there, all the triumphs, the setbacks, the \\"it's about time\\" moments, and the \\"oh my stars that did not just happen\\" moments added up to make my ideal ending....well....not ideal. I have come to terms with it. Heck, I even like it now. But still, it's not how I imagined I'd feel when I read it.<br /><br />So, yeah. I've read all kinds of reviews. I've talked to people who've loved it, who've hated it, who just didn't get it. When I think about it I don't think there is anything I would have changed yet there are so many things I wanted to be different. It was awesome but it hurt. A lot. Still, it was worth it. Oh so very worth it.
B005DR64OQ|2.0|Nicole Kidman and Nicolas Cage are great modern day actors ...... but unless this was a favor owed to somebody or a lost bet ........ how did they get sucked into doing this movie ?<br /><br />Ouch this was bad.<br /><br />Like others have commented, it is like watching an episode of World's Dumbest Criminals.<br /><br />I am not sure if this was supposed to be silly or suspenseful because the whole film comes across very goofy and comical.<br />You can't take anybody seriously.<br /><br />It would be interesting to know the full story of how this film came to be because it seems like something must have gone wrong behind the scenes to create such a mess.
0439023491|4.0|oh. my. stars. Now I have to wait for the third?!?! I couldn't even wait a few more months to read this one!!! Since I read an ARC I don't want to give anything away. I'll just say this....<br />....the beginning felt a bit rushed to me. There was a lot going on and and I couldn't really get my bearings. I liked it but was waiting to see where it went. Part way through the book it really picked up and grabbed me the way the first one did. I couldn't put it down. I like where the story went and although I had some ideas about what was going to happen I didn't have a clue how it was going to get there. I had extremely high expectations for this book and it didn't disappoint. The ending definitely  sets up the third book and I HAVE to know what happens!!!!! This is for sure a second in trilogy....the plot thickens but you end up without answers to your most pressing questions! If you want resolution wait until the third book comes out and read this one and that one in succession.

B004EPZ07K|1.0|This movie is great but don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray with digital copy.  The digital copy requires you to install third party software and input personnel information just to get the copy.  And then it runs on the third party software not via iTunes.  This is the biggest rip off yet.  You spend extra money to get it on an iPod/iPad/iTunes and it will not go but no were on the box does it state this limitation.  RIP OFF.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I've read in a long time. Growing up with a Commodore 64, then a Mac SE, a Mac LC, over to Windows 3.1 all the way to Windows 7, and now back over to OSX together with my iPod and awaiting an iPhone 4, this book explains all the whys and wherefores of the technological trajectory of my life -- the desires and motivations and compromises behind each product or technology to emerge, since Steve Jobs really was at the center of it all.  Indeed, the story of Jobs' life is a tremendous story -- not just of him, but of Apple, Pixar, music, retail, technology, and so much more. And having just finished the book, I realize that it's almost only the tip of the iceberg, and that every couple chapters could have expanded into their own books. This is not a 600-page man but a 6,000-page man. I would have loved to have read much more of the details of *how* Jobs restored Apple when he came back, to see what kind of lessons I might learn.  As for the biography itself, it's a funny thing -- it doesn't really feel like much of a biography at all, but rather journalism, like a really, really long newspaper article. Basically, the book simply reports his life, with each chapter organized around a theme and a time period. There isn't much \\"analysis\\" to it, or even much art to the writing -- just a straightforward history, with occasional conflicts of he-said she-said.  But perhaps that is to be expected, given that we don't know where technology will be going over the next fifty years, and therefore we still don't really know the full extent of Jobs' influence. It does feel funny that the book seems to clearly foreshadow Jobs' death, yet does not include it. I imagine a second edition will soon provide a much-needed coda.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2CD VERSION ***<br /><br />Little will prepare Tull fans for this. The sonic improvement and clarity on this 2CD remix/remaster is off-the-charts good - a truly fantastic improvement.<br /><br />A little history is needed to explain this - the CD reissues of this acknowledge gem have been fraught with so-so versions - a duffer bare-bones 1st outing in 1987, a 25th Anniversary attempt in 1996 (which to my ears is one of the worst remasters I've ever heard) and a much better shot at it by the audiophile company DCC in the States a year later. Good rather than great. We'll at last - for it's 40th anniversary in 2011 - EMI UK finally gets it right.<br /><br />Here are the details first - UK released Monday 31 Oct 2011, \\"Aqualung 40th Anniversary Special Edition\\" is a 2CD set on EMI/Chrysalis AQUAS 1 (5099908799920) and breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 (43:25 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 11 are their 4th album \\"Aqualung\\" - released 19 March 1971 in the UK on Chrysalis ILPS 9145 and 3 May 1971 in the USA on Reprise MS 2035. It reached number 4 and 7 on the UK and US LP charts. No 45's were released to support the album in the UK, but \\"Hymn 43\\" was put out as a 7\\" single in the USA with \\"Mother Goose\\" as its B-side on Reprise 1024.<br /><br />Disc 2 (44:51 minutes):<br />Track 1 is \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" - an album outtake that first appeared on the 1996 25th Anniversary reissue - this is a 2011 'New Mix'. It was supposed to be released as a single in 1971 on Chrysalis WIP 6098 in the UK, but was withdrawn<br />Track 2 is \\"Just Trying To Be\\" - first appeared as the last track on Side 2 of the July 1972 double album \\"Living In The Past\\". This is a 2011 'New Mix' at 1:37 minutes<br />Track 3 is \\"My God (Early Version)\\" - a 9:42 minute outtake complete with studio dialogue at the beginning<br />Track 4 is \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" - a 1:51 minute outtake recorded 13 Dec 1970<br />Track 5 is \\"Wind Up\\" - an 'Early Version' at 5:21 minutes with Ian Anderson on piano. This is a 2011 'New Mix'<br />Track 6 is \\"Slipstream (Take 2)\\" - a 54-second outtake<br />Track 7 is \\"Up The 'Pool\\" - an 'Early Version' at 1:12 minutes (released version is Track 10)<br />Track 8 is \\"Wond'ring Aloud, Again\\" - a 7:07 minute 'Full Morgan Version' with the band and extra verses<br />Tracks 9 to 13 are \\"Life Is A Long Song\\", \\"Up The Pool\\", \\"Dr Bogenbroom\\", \\"From Later\\" and \\"Nursie\\". 11 to 13 are new 2011 remasters. All 5 tracks were recorded in May 1971 and made up the \\"Life Is A Long Song\\" 7\\" EP released September 1971 on Chrysalis WIP 6106 in the UK (the picture sleeve is featured in the booklet). They reappeared as Tracks 3 to 7 on Side 4 of the \\"Living In The Past\\" double LP in 1972.<br />Track 14 is a 52-second \\"US Radio Spot\\" featuring Ian Anderson talking about the album and God with music snippets from several tracks<br />Note: Tracks 3, 4, 6 7 and 8 are PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED<br /><br />The 2CDs are housed in a 3-way foldout card digipak with a 32-page booklet. Nice touches include the painting-artwork of Burton Silverman reproduced beneath the 2 see-through trays (the inner gatefold of the original vinyl LP), the CDs are green in colour as per the original Chrysalis labels and the booklet numbers the pages in Roman numerals in keeping with the original album artwork. There are knowledgeable and detailed liner notes by DOM WILSON featuring new interviews with principal songwriter and lead vocalist IAN ANDERSON. The booklet is peppered with new colour photos from the period and a nice collage shot of trade adverts, foreign pictures sleeves and promo-related stuff. But the really big news is the NEW SOUND...<br /><br />Pages 26 and 27 give a detailed description by STEVEN WILSON on the lengths he went to in the remixing and remastering process to get the best possible sound out of the 8 and 16-track master tapes without compromising the integrity of the original recordings. Multi-Track Transfers were done by KRIS BURTON and Mastering carried out by PETER MEW at Abbey Road (a name long associated with quality reissues - see Listmania and tags). The results are amazing.<br /><br />Even as the opening riff of \\"Aqualung\\" rattles around your speakers accompanied by the sleazy \\"...sitting on a park bench...\\" lyrics - the audio quality is in your face, but not in a forced way. Suddenly the track has real muscle and the details leap out at you. It's breathing for the first time. \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" has superlative bass end now and the treated guitar 'so' good. But for me the real fireworks start with the double combo of the acoustic \\"Cheap Day Return\\" with the acoustic/rock of \\"Mother Goose\\". The improvement is GLORIOUS - and when the guitar kicked in half way through \\"Mother Goose\\" - I'll confess to blubbing out a little proggy tear. \\"Up To Me\\" is fantastically good too. The improvement continues on Side 2 - but even more so. The riff in \\"Hymn 43\\" is just huge now and the quiet lead into \\"Locomotive Breath\\" is not drenched in hiss - but clean and powerful. The album ends with \\"Wind Up\\" which has the best lyrics Anderson ever wrote about personal beliefs and it sounds just wonderful (lyrics above).<br /><br />I had thought after the blast of the album that Disc 2 would be throwaway - not so. A truly lovely gem tucked away on the \\"Living In The Past\\" 1972 double is \\"Just Trying To Be\\" which I had on a 1999 Mobile Fidelity remaster (see review) - well here the sound quality is beautiful and far better. I was also taken aback by the full 7-minute band version of \\"Wond'ring Aloud, Again\\" which properly stretches out - it's a superb bonus. It takes the \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" album track from \\"Aqualung\\" at 1:53 minutes length and adds on the \\"Wond'ring Again\\" outtake at 4:15 minutes length that turned up on the 1972 \\"Living In The Past\\" double and segues way them together with an extra bridge in the song and more lyrics (hence its new title here is a make up of both song titles - Morgan being the studio it was recorded in). It's very cleverly done and because there's new bits in it - it's been called 'Previously Unreleased'. The roughest sounding outtake here is the 'Early Version' of \\"My God\\", but again his passion in the vocals is the reason for inclusion. And again the clarity on the 5-track \\"Life Is A Long Song\\" EP is far better than that on the MF release. Great stuff...<br /><br />Niggles - the original album had an inner sleeve with lyrics - no show. This is a sloppy exclusion especially given the importance of words on this album.<br /><br />I bought \\"Aqualung\\" when it came out in March 1971 as a spotty 12-year old and have loved it ever since. Finally this reissue does it justice. And the \\"Super Deluxe\\" box set has further 5.1 mixes that have received rave reviews too.<br /><br />I suspect that Steven Wilson, Kris Burton and Peter Mew will be up for awards for their mastering skills on this reissue - a top job done and one of 'the' reissues of 2011.<br /><br />Roll on \\"Living In The Past\\" the 1972 Double Album - it deserves the same lavish treatment...ering carried out by PETER MEW at Abbey Road (a name long associated with quality reissues - see Listmania and tags).

0300169787|5.0|Savage Beauty is a must see/keep for all, not just fans of fashion or fashion students.  McQueen's esthetic was amazing and breathtaking; such a loss that he is gone.  The quality of photos in this book is excellent and they capture McQueen's impeccable attention to drape, cut and construction so beautifully.
0446585025|5.0|I have Ellen's 2 other books and knew that this one would be just as good, if not better. Well, it was WAY better!! I never stopped laughing and I couldn't put it down...hence the reason I finished it in one day! My mom borrowed it and she finished it in one day as well. Ellen is so highly entertaining and this book is just terrific!
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I couldn't force myself to listen through this a second time. No, no, no, no, no--not a second time. I had felt trapped inside one of those American commercials for K-Tel Records back in the 1970s, where a snippet is played from each track of whatever LP K-Tel was promoting at the time. Beatles songs are too classic to be reduced to snippets and mashups. It's degrading. Perhaps this CD works well with its accompanying circus act, but without it...well...Put it down to my being well over 50.  The other thing is: there's lots of great bona fide Beatles music from 1970-2010 that's a lot more fun to listen to than these desecrations. Or should I say `Beatle' rather than `Beatles' music. Just take the best of post-1960 John, Paul, George and Ringo and alternate the tracks in 1960s Beatles format of any given era, such as 1970-1973. What you end up with is much like what the Beatles would have done had they stayed as about as intact as they had been for half the White Album. Let's Face it: the Beatles recorded a lot of tracks solo or in twosomes in the second half of the 1960s. It was well nigh impossible to get all four of them together for two tracks in a row on the White. So mixing up material the amongst the four artists would not have been a dramatic break from Beatles tradition. It's more a continuation and intensification of the White Album way.  It sure beats listening to the likes of this `Love' CD.
1451648537|5.0|The author boils everything down to the succinct. If you're old enough to have played Pong on an Atari 2600, you'll relive that golden age. The book is like a time capsule, transporting you through the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and beyond. Loved every page of it. A fascinating portrait of a digital pitchman. Enjoyable even if you don't consider yourself a \\"book reader\\".
B005COO1X6|2.0|When Stephen King is on, he is ON.  Here, he is far from on.  An alien that takes the shape of a station wagon made of mud that eats people, and is chased off by an 8 year old with a magnifying glass?  Ughh.  Wasted a perfectly good 45 minutes on this.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I first saw this a my uncles and after the first try I couldn't put it down.  It infatuates you with a labyrinth like puzzle but this ones on steroids putting you through puzzle after puzzle. The only problem that I've found is that my first one before returning, some of the track came apart and there is no way to get inside the sphere to fix it.
0553801473|5.0|...if you have been reading A Song of Ice and Fire (and if you haven't, why would you be interested in this volume?) -- Martin's narration of Westeros, the lands north of the Wall, the lands to the East, and all the varied characters and creatures that inhabit this world maintains its high quality. There are events that are jaw-droppingly unexpected and game-changing (as in the other books); and, as with the other books in this series, I was especially sorry to see this one come to a conclusion, because who knows how long it will be until the next installment appears? So many storylines continued and new ones set in motion whose unfolding I want to see.... So if you're a \\"fan\\" of the series, you must get this one too... If you haven't yet discovered A Song of Ice and Fire, get A Game of Thrones and begin the journey.
0786891416|3.0|The best thing about the show Castle is Nathan Fillion for those you who don't know who that is that is the guy who plays Castle.  His character writes books on the show and this is supposedly one of his books.<br /><br />The idea of a TV character writing the actual book about characters he works with is just awesome!  To be able to buy it is just a quirky thing a show like that would do.<br /><br />The characters (now try to follow me if you can) are the characters from the show but not really.  They are fictionalizations of the fiction characters.  Things that haven't happen to the characters on the TV show do happen in the books.  That being said the characters miss something that the TV show has. I don't know if it was the way the scenes where described but they just did not play out as smoothly in my mind as they would on TV.  So I did not really enjoy this as I do the show.  It had the quirkiness of the show but disappointed me somewhat.  I love watching the show but I don't know I would read another of the books.
B00006FR47|2.0|This review is for the sound only, not the album itself which is excellent enough as it is.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with the sound of this remaster. They boosted frequencies and threw everything out of whack, including the tones of the instruments, like they do with so many 'remasters' these days. It's totally annoying to listen to and sounds spastic and unnatural. If you want to hear how this album should sound, get the original vinyl (even transfered to CD it sounds much better than this 'remaster') or the 1995 Chicago Records CD remaster instead. The Chicago Group Portrait 4 CD Box Set remaster from the early 90s is also a great value now because all the idiots buy the latest remasters as if latest is automatically best without bothering to use their own ears; I bought mine for under 10 bucks right here in amazon. The box set only has some of the songs but those sound the way they should sound. When you crank it up on a good old school stereo system (I run a Bryston amp through Polk RTi12 speakers) you hear the pristine balance of the arrangements in their natural, unaltered context with the instruments and vocals all in their natural tones and relations.
B004JVZXXU|1.0|We watched it since we really liked Part 1. Part 2 has the same low-budget super-realistic feel, but the similarities end there. There is no tension in the movie. Thankfully its not very long.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|What a nice case! It's not expensive and it does the job very well. The case material has just enough flex in it to offer some cushioning in case you drop your phone but it's not too thick so it isn't bulky. I love it and the price makes the case a great value!

B0017V7H70|4.0|This is one of the great punk/punk-pop albums.  I really enjoy nearly every track, and while all of the Offspring's more modern stuff (since 2000) is a little more light-hearted/pop, this album is what really put them in the spotlight.  Depending on what, exactly, you like about the Offspring, you may find Smash a little harder than you like, but if you consider yourself a fan, you have to own this album and give it a try.
B005WY8YZW|5.0|All I have to say is Maynard James Keenan is the Pablo Picasso of our time. See him live if you get a chance and don't hesitate on buying this album.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I was surprised at how different this album was from their previous work, like Smash and Ignition, but while it's a little more pop-style, it's a really good album.  Let's face it, Dexter can only do so much with his voice to be \\"pop-style,\\" but the music is good, with undertones (mostly vocal) of their previous work.  Despite being different, I find that whenever I put together an Offspring playlist, I always find myself looking for some song which is inevitably on \\"Americana.\\"
0385535139|5.0|I like courtroom dramas and Grisham delivers on this one. What makes it interesting is the psychological profiles of the players. I could visualize each one; they seemed like people I had met. I speed read most novels, but this one held my interest to the end. His description of the bored jury is priceless.
B0041KKYGA|2.0|`Anonymous' takes certain facts from Tudor history and weaves an entertaining and exciting story around them, incorporating more than one conspiracy theory.  It has an all-star cast and is visually superb, and well-acted.  Vanessa Redgrave and her daughter Joely Richardson make a perfect pair as the older and younger versions of Queen Elizabeth I.  We marvel at the re-creation of Tudor London; but it is all pretty silly, in historical terms.    It is true that, in 1601, the Earl of Essex was involved in a conspiracy to seize power, was thwarted by William Cecil, and executed in the Tower of London.  It is also true that the Earl of Southampton was involved in the plot; that he was a patron of William Shakespeare, and may have been the mysterious `Mr .W.H.', to whom the poet's Sonnets were dedicated; but much of the rest of the film - including the fundamental idea that it was the Earl of Oxford who wrote Shakespeare's plays - is fantasy.  Some respectable scholars have entertained doubts as to the authorship of the plays; and the Earl of Oxford has been proposed as an alternative, along with Sir Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and the Earl of Derby.  Derek Jacobi and Mark Rylance, who star in this film, are both on record as `Oxfordians'; but their fame, and any success which `Anonymous' may have, should not lend respectability to the theory.  It was first proposed in 1920 in his book 'Shakespeare Identified', by a somewhat eccentric English schoolmaster, J. Thomas Looney (sic), who chose to ignore the fact that the Earl of Oxford died in 1604, whereas the plays kept appearing for several years after that.  Shakespeare, by the way, died in 1616).  Two of Looney's followers developed the theory that Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I had been lovers and had produced a son; but Looney himself rejected that idea, since he feared that it would bring his original theory into disrepute.  The makers of `Anonymous' seem to have no such fear.  They suggest, not only that Elizabeth and Oxford had a child together (the Earl of Southampton), but also that Elizabeth was Oxford's mother - so that incest, and a double dose of illicit sex are added to the heady brew.  They also have Oxford writing all Shakespeare's plays, even those which appeared after his own death; and they portray Shakespeare himself as an illiterate buffoon, whereas in real life he attended a grammar school in Stratford, where he would have received a rigorous education.  Meanwhile Elizabeth I is shown as Cecil's dupe, at least in her dotage, which it is difficult to believe that she ever was.    Of course, Shakespeare himself took liberties with the facts; but the film takes too many.  It is also open to the same objection as many conspiracy theories.  A rational observer is bound to think that, if all this were true, and so many people were involved, somebody would have spilled the beans.  Moreover, if we apply Ockham's razor to the problem, we must conclude, along with A.L.Rowse, Stanley Wells, Stephen Greenblatt, Bill Bryson, Trevor Nunn and many others, that it was Shakespeare who wrote Shakespeare; and, if that is so, this film is little more than a variation on a theme by J. Thomas Looney.  Stephen Cooper
0679731725|5.0|Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day gracefully reveals a noble life of an Engish butler, Mr. Stevens, who, for several years, has devoted his whole life for 'greatness' and 'dignity.' His dedication to Darlington Hall, unfortunately, deprives him of the only love he should have had. A beautifully written book that will truly touch your heart and leave you 'dignified.' One of the best books ever written in English of our time. At just over 200 pages, this novel exercises the restraint so eminent in its protagonist. The reliability of the narration is a constant query; Stevens' blind loyalty to his seniors is evident throughout, though it only serves to enhance the development of the plot. It is a novel that remains alarmingly relevant to this day.
1423140591|3.0|This book comes off a bit flat compared to the other Rick Riordan books I have read. The pace seems slower than the previous books and the new characters just not as charming. Hopefully the wait for the next book will be worth it or this may very well be a jumping off point of the series for me.
B005LJITS0|2.0|This story has been told and told and told. It's known to every comic book kid in the world. The beginning of the Earther Green Lantern. It was just recently re-re-redone in animation, full length feature film only about two years or so ago and now we get to see the same, identical movie done with real life actors using CG instead of animation... oh boy, I can't wait to read The Hobbit again, for the 27th time... Couldn't Hollywood use SOME OTHER STORYLINE for once?!

1455510319|2.0|I listened to the audio version.  I think the part I liked the least is Mickey's inability to just get out of Maggie's life.  I can't stand her, and I can't stand his grovelling.  This was not one of Connelly's best efforts, in any way.  Now I have something for the review police:  If it bugs you so much that readers discuss the Kindle price on the review pages, why don't you try to get Amazon to make a highly visible area where customers can discuss the price of Kindle books.  It should be easy to get to from the review area, so that the complaints won't get buried somewhere no one will read them.  I think people complain about price in the reviews because there is no place else that gets such a large audience.  I read a lot of books, but I don't have a Kindle.  Ordinarily, I would want one, but thanks to the folks here who have alerted me, via the review pages, to the cost issue, I didn't spend my hard earned money on the device.  I am suspicious that some of the review police are plants by Amazon, who wants to avoid having  people who might be buying Kindles, not buy them because of the negative comments about the price of the books.  Surely people do not come on this site and buy or not buy books from just looking at the stars without reading any of the reviews.  I especially enjoy the bad reviews, but since the Kindle issue doesn't apply to me, I take that into account when I think about buying the book just like I consider the reviewer's possible point of view.  I get tired of reading about the prices, but I am just as tired of the review police.  Give it a rest, or find a solution.
B005J29HCQ|3.0|I'm sorry, but I just don't see this as being a good album. I am a big Beach Boys fan, but this CD is just one long boring experimental CD. It sounds like they were all stoned. No wonder Brian Wilson put it off for 45 years. The only songs worth listening to are Surf's Up, Hero's and Villians, and Good Vibrations. Pet Sounds blows this away!Sorry people,but this is crap!
0439023521|5.0|One of the best MG/YA books ever written. I couldn't put it down. I went to sleep thinking about the book and woke up thinking about the book.  Author Suzanne Collins' crafted an amazing story. Masterful in every way.  The Hunger Games will disturb you, challenge you, tear your heartstrings. It will not disappoint
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|A very clear explanation of the digital trends that are already in play in transforming life and industry. The interesting nugget for the cynic is an overlay of Moore's Law of computing power doubling every 18mo or so, on the official IT industry in the US. Through a series of logical steps we arrive at the conclusion that the year 2006 was the year when digital technology raced past human capacity to keep up. We are now in a catch up mode.<br /><br />A great read.

1451648537|5.0|Some reviewers say that the book does not answer the question why he made certain decision. Innovative ideas are often subconscience in nature. Even Steve himself would not be able to give exact reasoning for them. I am satisfied with the record of how things happened.  Isaacson puts Steve Jobs next to Edison and Ford. I think Steve Jobs is more like Henry Ford, a great entrepreneur. An inventor figured out a product and see its potential to change the world. An entrepreneur see the potential of a product and put people and things together to actually deliver the benefits and profits.  He designed the Mac after appreciating the power of graphical interfaces (from Xerox). He created the iPod, while Sony had all the necessary assets and heritage but could not do it.  Today many companies have the assets for people-oriented universal communication: Apple, Google, HP, Microsoft.  Who can put ideas together to win bigger?
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Let's face it, Bj&ouml;rk is quite the character - that may be an understatement. Regardless of that unique truth, Bj&ouml;rk is one of today's most intriguing, talented musicians. [[ASIN:B005ELQVGW Biophilia]], additionally,  is easily one of 2011's best albums.  For the more `traditional' music lover, an album the likes of Biophilia may not be `your cup of tea.'  For the avid classical, experimental rock, or electronic music lover,  Biophilia will be an album that you spin for years to come.  One continual tone poem dabbling in the universe, supernatural, and biology,  Biophilia is an album deserving of a Grammy that will most likely go overlooked.  Regardless, if you are interested in a captivating, experimental listen and have never tried Bj&ouml;rk, Biophilia might just change your life.  Additionally, it made for quite the Halloween soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"Moon\\" opens the effort exceptionally, featuring the harp (who uses harp these days!?!?).  Tons of vocal effects surround Bj&ouml;rk's commanding vocals.  Bj&ouml;rk oscillates between being restrained and belting here quite effectively.  The use of a choir as the track evolves alongside the constant minimalist vibe cultivated here makes \\"Moon\\" a treat and excellent opener.  \\"Thunderbolt\\" keeps up the strange vibes and momentum, using the organ as the instrument of accompaniment.  \\"Thunderbolt\\" is as mystical and strange as the opener with synthetic lines underlying.  The choral arrangement is magnificent.  What more is there to say? As oddball as both the opener and \\"Thunderbolt\\" are, there is an underlying brilliance that most artists today wouldn't even dare to try.  \\"Crystalline,\\" the excellent first single is still a standout upon listening to Biophilia in its entirety.  The use of electronics are a highlight, not to mention an accessible (or somewhat-accessible) refrain which helps to clarify the ponderous and dense nature of this affair - if that's possible.  Three cuts in, Biophilia is nothing short of eccentric genius.<br /><br />\\"Cosmogony\\" may be my favorite cut.  While it is odd, there is a better sense of cohesion here in comparison to the rest of the album. \\"Cosmogony\\" opens with celestial, ominous synth pads - a nice tone poem effect achieved to represent `the universe.'  \\"Cosmogony\\" features superb vocals by Bj&ouml;rk that make the listener hinge on to every word.  The airy supporting background vocals, coupled with the valedictory orchestration makes this track one of the album's crowing achievements. \\"Dark Matter\\" has a hard act to follow, but does a fine job causing the effort to lose no momentum.  \\"Dark Matter,\\" just as its title prescribes, is nothing short of `freaky.'  Much like the `film-music' concept that Biophilia cultivates, \\"Dark Matter\\" features Bj&ouml;rk's most chilling vocal performance filled with dynamic contrasts and genius supporting background vocals.  A clear high point is the fact that \\"Dark Matter\\" is the first cut from the album not to clock in at over five minutes; it only last 3:22.<br /><br />\\"Hollow\\" is another oddity - but what else do you expect from Bj&ouml;rk? The minimalist aspect is superb, cultivated through strings and once more organ.  Unpredictable, this in itself is part of the allure of this oddball cut that just misses the six minute mark in duration.  As much experimental rock as it is utilizing classical techniques and devices, \\"Hollow\\" is a brilliant anomaly.  Most people won't get it, but for those who love and live to experiment, \\"Hollow\\" is just more `icing on the cake.' \\"Virus\\" is more accessible than the majority of cuts with a lighter opening that contrasts the heaviness of cuts like \\"Dark Matter\\" and \\"Hollow.\\" Bj&ouml;rk's vocals are pure and the lyrics are `out-of-the box' and creative. The bridge section a completely different harmonic scheme, which helps to alleviate predictability on this cut.  \\"Virus\\" makes Biophilia stand at seven for seven.<br /><br />\\"Sacrifice\\" possesses an oriental sound, again serving as a contrast to previous cut \\"Virus.\\" Not a personal favorite, \\"Sacrifice\\" is still above par and supremely creative.  \\"Mutual Core\\" `smokes it,' again finding Bj&ouml;rk dabbling again with the organ, which is both mysterious and beautiful.  Bj&ouml;rk continues experiments using hardcore electronic production.  \\"Solstice\\" decelerates the effort, finding the effort (in standard form) closing with plucked strings (harp) and Bj&ouml;rk stripping things back down.  In deluxe form, Biophilia features three more cuts, an extended version of the oddity \\"Hollow,\\" an exceptional choir and organ featuring version of \\"Dark Matter,\\" and spastic, manic, rhythmic cut \\"Nattura.\\" If the decision is between the standard and deluxe versions, go on and splurge for the deluxe - you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Basically, [[ASIN:B005ELQVGW Biophilia]] is a masterpiece.  It is not an album for everyone, but for those who love an album that challenges them musically and as a musical listener, Biophilia fills the gap.  In my opinion, Biophilia is one of my favorites of 2011 as of yet.  Kudos to you Bj&ouml;rk!, \\"Sacrifice\\" is still above par and supremely creative.  \\"Mutual Core\\" `smokes it,' again finding Björk dabbling again with the organ, which is both mysterious and beautiful.

B0052TDGQO|5.0|I'm enjoying Scotty's music and I'm not normally a country western fan.  I voted for him when he was in American Idol and was glad he won.  Also glad Amazon had it so I didn't have to go hunting it somewhere else.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|For even the most avid Coldplay fans (myself being one), [[ASIN:B0053YGYO4 Mylo Xyloto]] is a bit of a `hard pill to swallow.'  Sure, beyond the sheen-laden layers and the overt optimism lies `the' Coldplay that fans and casual listeners have come to love, but after four solid efforts, Mylo comes off a bit too `commercial.'  Sure, the band still possesses its alternative/indie edge, but featuring Rihanna, one of pop's most successful artists itself is a concession to the mainstream.  An album that will most likely yield its greatness with several spins,  Mylo Xyloto is an album that won't be for everybody.<br /><br />Following the opening intro (\\"Mylo Xyloto\\"), Coldplay instantly shock with the overt optimistic cut \\"Hurts Like Heaven.\\" Upon an initial listen, most avid fans may be a bit surprised by the departure that is \\"Hurts Like Heaven.\\" While it is different from say the gloomy, low key vibe of \\"Politik\\" ([[ASIN:B000069AUI A Rush of Blood to the Head]]), it is an enjoyable cut. Let's put it this way, if it weren't `Coldplay,' most people would probably love it unconditionally.  Different, \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" is one of the album's better cuts. \\"Paradise\\" was a bit of a shocker itself, but was a solid choice for a single.  The harmonic progression is solid, though again, \\"Paradise\\" is another slight deviation for Coldplay.  The drum groove is undeniable, regardless if it is `Coldplay' or not.  In the same token, \\"Paradise\\" does not quite stack up against \\"Viva La Vida,\\" \\"Violet Hill,\\" \\"Fix You,\\" or \\"Clocks.\\"<br /><br />\\"Charlie Brown\\" makes fewer concessions to the mainstream, though one will be quick to cite the four-on-the-floor percussive groove (Motown maybe?).  The vocal production is great around Martin's signature vocals and the play with asymmetric meter is noteworthy.  \\"Charlie Brown\\" may still be `happy', but there is a more of the traditional Coldplay sound here than many other cuts from this effort.  A quibble: somebody please tell me what Chris Martin is saying at certain times.  \\"Up Against the World\\" opens with a lush `wall of sound' - thanks to Brian Eno one would suspect.  The accompaniment by acoustic guitar with Martin singing so pure and beautifully is nice making us all appreciate the great attributes of the band.  Following \\"Up Against the World\\" comes another interlude \\"M.M.I.X.,\\" this time foreshadowing single \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.\\"  \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" continues an unusual optimism and poppy nature.  What is great is Coldplay's willingness to dabble in electronic and acoustic textures and even pop sounds/soundscapes.  The downside is that some of the experiments threaten Coldplay to perhaps lose some of their alternative credibility.  Enjoyable? Yes.<br /><br />\\"Major Minus\\" is one of the albums's shining spots.  The sound instantly grabs the listener's attention with its `rootsy,' folk-driven rock sound.  The guitars are dirty (think garage bands) and the use of vocal effects is superb.  \\"Major Minus\\" is a personal favorite.  \\"U.F.O.\\" makes some of the momentum \\"Major Minus\\" wane, which is unfortunate.  Martin is a bit covered up by a present string pad and the cut comes off as a bit sleepy, despite its brief 2:17.  Rihanna's guest spot on \\"Princess of China,\\" the third single, brightens things, somewhat  The production again shocks all indie-rocker's looking for another \\"Violet Hill,\\" but the results are ok.  \\"Princess of China\\" is not quite the superstar collaboration it should of been with Rihanna sounding a bit too tame for her own good.  The groove is undeniable if nothing else and the vocal production is another shining spot. Give the band credit for experimenting, even if they really don't need or have to at this point.  `They are Coldplay.'<br /><br />\\"Up In Flames\\" possesses a nice urban-pop quality (in respect to indie-rock). The stripped nature of the sound is notable, given off an `atmospheric' nature.  Martin's falsetto has never sounded better.  \\"A Hopeful Transmission,\\" yet another somewhat pointless interlude contrasts \\"Up in Flames\\" leading into the bombast of \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart.\\" While \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\" might not be described as my `cup of tea,' I do appreciate that some of Coldplay's signature minimalism shines through the sheen.  Closer \\"Up With the Birds\\" uses an upright piano, which is a nice timbre touch.  Martin sounds superb vocally and an eventually shift of style/tempo picks up with a change of sound.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0053YGYO4 Mylo Xyloto]] is a mixed-bag.  It is still a Coldplay album when examined closely, but in some respects lacks the character and distinctness of previous Coldplay albums.  One thing I personally can't knock the band for is their willingness to experiment and not produce the same album they've produced previously.  That said, there needs to be a balance between extreme changes and the musical personality that Martin and the boys have established with their audience and fans.ss interlude contrasts \\"Up in Flames\\" leading into the bombast of \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart.\\" While \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\" might not be described as my `cup of tea,' I do appreciate that some of Coldplay's signature minimalism shines through the sheen.

B005HPY8LU|4.0|The original queen of American Idol is one of few of the show's alumni to turn her television fame into a legitimate recording career.  That is not to say that Ms. Clarkson hasn't hit a few rough patches - [[ASIN:B000QFAJ7S My December]] just didn't work after six-time mega smash [[ASIN:B00064ADRK Breakaway]] and [[ASIN:B001AQXJ9W All I Ever Wanted]] failed to reach the million mark despite featuring #1 hit \\"My Life Would Suck Without You.\\" That said, [[ASIN:B005HPY8LU Stronger]] might be Clarkson's best album in regards to consistency and quality since Breakaway.  While Clarkson doesn't dabble into angst-filled rock like Breakaway or My December or settle into the more electronic sounds cultivated on All I Ever Wanted,  Stronger ends up sounding more like a `greatest hits' of Clarkson.  It never shocks, but it plays well to the pop market right now, which is, well, all-over-the-place.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Know It All\\" is a solid opening cut as well as first single.  Sure, it isn't near as daring as \\"My Life Would Suck Without You,\\" but Clarkson sure sings the heck out of it.  \\"Mr. Know It All\\" recalls Clarkson \\"The Trouble With Love Is\\" days from her debut effort ([[ASIN:0634096893 Kelly Clarkson - Thankful]]), which for those who were fans when she was more of an urban-pop singer, will be more than please with this somewhat restrained, yet catchy first single.  The production is firmly helmed in the adult contemporary and Clarkson has never sounded better, tamer or not.  If \\"Mr. Know It All\\" didn't invigorate those looking for Clarkson's more `P!nk' side, \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\\" reascends Clarkson into rock-star status. The production utilizes more electric instruments in contrasts to the opener's more acoustic, organic sound.  The big refrain suits Clarkson's voice perfectly.  On the equally alluring \\"Dark Side,\\" Clarkson favors an 80's sound (thanks to Greg Kurstin) with a nice low-key four-on-the-floor groove that eventually evolves into a more overt groove.  Kelly's vocals are stunning and the refrain yet again finds Clarkson honing her skill for big, memorable hooks.<br /><br />\\"Honestly\\" is incredibly nebulous in sound initially, but evolves into a more structured, energetic cut.  The harmonic progression is a highlight, particularly on the bridge section. \\"You Love Me\\" is another solid cut, like \\"Honestly,\\" without superseding \\"Mr. Know It All,\\" \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger),\\" or \\"Dark Side.\\"  The production yields a more adult contemporary sound and is catchy enough without being the most catchy or best cut of the album.  \\"Einstein\\" is more entertaining, clocking in at just under three minutes.  The vocal production is clear and well thought out.  The songwriting is credible and coupled with the urban-pop sound, makes \\"Einstein\\" one of Stronger's `strongest' moments.<br /><br />\\"Standing in Front of You\\" opens with an ethereal-sounding pad. Kelly sounds fine here (vocal production is still a highlight), however the overall performance may be the slightest bit too casual when all is said-and-done.  The background vocals are a nice touch if nothing else.  \\"I Forgive You\\" suffers from sounding a bit like a `knock-off' \\"Since U Been Gone,\\" possessing a similar beat to it and Lady Gaga's hit \\"Edge of Glory.\\"  The refrain is as big as ever - and predictable, but the cut just doesn't quite yield a home run. Produced by Rodney \\"Darkchild\\" Jerkins, I personally expected more of Jerkins's signature production style to shine here.  \\"Hello\\" finds Clarkson showing off some nice, soulful-pop grit.  \\"Hello,\\" a sound cut, benefits most from its brevity clocking in just shy of three minutes itself.<br /><br />\\"The War Is Over\\" reinvigorates the momentum of Stronger, contrasting uptempo cuts \\"I Forgive you\\" and \\"Hello.\\"  The big drums are typical of adult contemporary these days and contribute a nice quality to this cut.  \\"Let Me Down\\" is even better, however, with funky sounding drums and sound production by Chris Destefano.  The change of pace is a welcome one with Clarkson's vocals being some of her most commanding vocals on the entire effort.  \\"You Can't Win\\" and \\"Breaking Your Own Heart\\" close the album soundly enough, but aren't the best cuts of the effort.<br /><br />Overall, Stronger is a well crafted effort.  It is not an innovative showing by the pop princess, but one that shows how much of a chameleon that Clarkson has been and is.  With that said, it is an excellent representation of a pop star with an exceptional vocal gift.  Even when the material sags ever so slightly, Clarkson's commanding lead vocals atone and adjust marvelously.one with Clarkson's vocals being some of her most commanding vocals on the entire effort.  \\"You Can't Win\\" and \\"Breaking Your Own Heart\\" close the album soundly enough, but aren't the best cuts of the effort.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I have really enjoyed every HP movie, but I won't be buying this version for one reason and one reason alone.  Ultraviolet.  It is not a digital copy as you know it. Others have detailed why; I bought Horrible Bosses and learned for myself.  Want to listen on a plane?  Forget it. In a place with no wi-fi? Forget it.  Want it to work in iTunes?  Forget it. Want to avoid creating new accounts with web services you could care less about?  Forget it (you have to create two different accounts to get Ultraviolet to work - couldn't even make that easy for you). Worried about paying for KB usage on your wireless device when carriers change their plans based on usage?  You should be - you'll essentially be paying to watch this movie each time you watch it.   My recommendation - buy an AppleTV and buy it through iTunes.

0307593312|2.0|What's got me interested to pick up and read this book in the first place was my curiosity about Murakami's version of Japan in 1984. The book not only serves the purpose but it also has an interesting plot, a mix of religious philosophy and detective story. However, the plot could have been much more engaging if it had been told differently. Murakami repeats the background stories of his characters in every few chapters as if he was expecting the readers to be suffering from dementia. With such repetitions, it was difficult to remain upbeat about the development of the detective part, which was progressing slowly, way too slowly. Towards the end of Book 2 I lost interest and was ready to put it down as I failed to feel any connections with any of the characters who seem to be overly obsessed with human body parts, especially genitals. I think the book would have been better if it were 50% shorter -- where are the editors when we need them? Unless you are a fanatic Murakami fan, you may want to skip this book and wait instead for its abridged edition or its movie version, which will save your time and might be more enjoyable.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|It might have sounded good on paper.<br /><br />That's the only explanation one can come up with for the genesis of \\"Lulu\\", the surprise collaborative album by METALLICA and Lou Reed that first had fans scratching their heads and now, since the album surfaced online ahead of this week's release, shaking them in horror. It could have been a fascinating mix: the biggest, most powerful metal act of its generation joining creative forces with one of rock's dark urban poets and iconoclasts, whose band THE VELVET UNDERGROUND has cast an enormous influence over untold numbers of alternative, punk and avant-garde acts.<br /><br />And indeed, when METALLICA and Reed jammed together at the New York concerts honoring the 25th anniversary of the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 2009, there seemed to be something there. Reed (67 at the time) looked and sounded inspired, while METALLICA seemed to find a loose yet still massive groove as it rumbled behind Reed on \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"White Light/White Heat\\".<br /><br />But all that cannot rectify the fact that \\"Lulu\\" is a catastrophic failure on almost every level, a project that could quite possibly do irreparable harm to METALLICA's career. Reed doesn't have as much to worry about, since his recent work has gone further and further into obscure, avant-garde reworkings of some of his older material and has become increasingly irrelevant to mainstream pop/rock. For METALLICA -- who earned back a lot of good faith with 2008's \\"Death Magnetic\\" after fans turned their noses up at 2003's \\"St. Anger\\" -- the damage could be a lot worse, and the band is bizarrely doing everything it can to help that along, as we'll discuss a little later.<br /><br />The original idea -- which might have worked -- was to have Reed re-record a selection of his older songs with METALLICA acting more or less as his backing band. But instead, the singer came up with another venture: he wanted the band to set music to a series of lyrics/poems he'd written for a stage production based on two early 20th century plays by German Expressionist writer Frank Wedekind. The lyrics allegedly tell the story of a seductive, amoral woman who somehow ends up crossing paths with Jack the Ripper.<br /><br />From the start, the album's biggest problem is that it sounds like someone took two completely disparate recordings and laid them over each other. Much of the music that METALLICA has recorded for this sounds like either unfinished jams or basic song structures (like the generic thrash of \\"Mistress Dread\\") that are a long way from the final versions that would appear on a METALLICA record (here's a question: is any of this stuff taken from the semi-legendary, abandoned Presidio sessions of 2001?). There are germs of interesting ideas here, and some earthshaking riffs do emerge from time to time, but it's hard to imagine METALLICA would put this material out as is on a proper album.<br /><br />Now, imagine that someone left the tape running of this material (some 95 minutes of it) and an old man wandered in off the street and started recording his own incoherent, cracked-voice ramblings and rantings over it. That, in a nutshell, is what you get on all 10 interminable tracks found on \\"Lulu\\". On nearly every cut, Reed's wavering, emotionless, melody-free vocals undermine any potential musical power that the band can muster. With a few exceptions, the vocals and music don't sound like they belong in the same universe, let alone the same room.<br /><br />The album actually starts out with a moment where one can glimpse something interesting from METALLICA: as the main riff of \\"Brandenburg Gate\\" crashes into existence, the band locks into an easy, bluesy groove as frontman James Hetfield (who delivers counterpoint vocals on several tracks) bellows \\"small town girl!\\" over and over. It's kind of fascinating to hear METALLICA play so loosely -- but then Reed comes in and wipes all that away.<br /><br />The most conventional track on the record, \\"Iced Honey\\", settles into a similar pocket that makes it the closest thing on here to an accessible song. On this one Reed semi-sings to the music and crafts what we suppose passes for a melody line from him these days. But \\"Iced Honey\\", while not a particularly strong song, sounds like pop genius compared to the never-ending drones of \\"Cheat On Me\\", \\"Pumping Blood\\", \\"Frustration\\" and most of the others. There are a lot of ambient passages where the fragility of Reed's voice comes out in even more stark relief, while the members of METALLICA flounder around behind him and attempt to create some sort of sonic landscape.<br /><br />As far as the concept of \\"Lulu\\" itself goes, Reed's lyrics are full of references to \\"colored man's dick,\\" \\"waste\\" that he wants to \\"eat,\\" and wanting to marry someone who is \\"spermless like a girl.\\" He threatens to \\"cut my legs and tits off/when I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski\\" in his very first lines on the record, throwing in his trademark references to other aspects of culture, but it is Hetfield himself who comes up with the greatest howler on second track \\"The View\\" by inexplicably screaming \\"I am the table!\\" (which in the song's official lyrics is actually written as \\"the tablet,\\" as in a block of stone) -- a line that will haunt the singer/guitarist for some time to come.<br /><br />A track-by-track analysis is almost futile when each track delivers more of the same deadening, dull grind, right up to the 19-minute closer \\"Junior Dad\\". While that final exercise begins with a gentle, slowly building and almost poignant guitar theme, by the time one reaches the finish line, there's nothing but a sense of exhaustion and incredulity.<br /><br />What's even more inexplicable about this whole demented affair -- and which we alluded to above -- is METALLICA and Reed's solid, unyielding support for this broken toy they've created. Again, we almost can't fault Reed, since this is the most high-profile project he's been involved with in years. But for METALLICA to say over and over again in interviews how proud they are, how strong this record is, and -- more ominously -- how it may point the way musically for the next proper METALLICA record... well, they're either delusional, feel forced to show solidarity with Reed, or trying to hide their embarrassment behind a wall of bravado.<br /><br />Did anyone attempt to stop this thing in its tracks at any time? Did every single person involved in this project -- from managers to producers to the guy who brings coffee to the studio -- praise it enthusiastically to the faces of the members of METALLICA, even if they were hiding their distaste inside? Has no one -- not even the shrewd and generally savvy Lars Ulrich -- considered the confusion and anger this could cause among fans, or even paused to think, \\"Gee, this really doesn't sound very good, does it?\\"<br /><br />One can argue that METALLICA is too big, too rich and too established to care what anyone thinks, and that they're in a phase of their career where they need to stretch themselves and take risks in order to keep themselves interested. All of that is, in one sense, absolutely correct. But putting this record out under the METALLICA name, when it is so clearly driven by the vision of another person entirely, is simply too far a stretch to ask from fans, especially when they're plunking down good money to buy it.<br /><br />The ideal solution, perhaps, would have been to put this out as a Reed album, without METALLICA's name on it, and let the world virally/organically discover who the singer's backing band was for the sessions. That might have added a cool \\"surprise\\" or \\"mystery\\" factor to the project and perhaps even taken the sting out of how poorly conceived it is. Then again, maybe not, because \\"poorly conceived\\" may not do justice to how horrendously this has turned out. This makes St Anger sound like a 21st century Master of Puppets. The impetus behind that album was at least there to understand; the incentive for this one is MIA.<br /><br />As we said at the beginning, this might have sounded good on paper. But someone should have crumpled up that paper and thrown it away.

B005UD1E2A|4.0|This is a review of the Harper Collins Kindle edition.<br /><br />I've, of course, heard of Discworld, but never read one of the stories before.<br /><br />The idea of a world that actually is on the back of a giant turtle, and held up by 4 elephants is quite fun.  As you learn in The Color of Magic, be very careful about the edge!  The author's foreword is quite interesting and nice to see an author admit that yes, his world isn't coherent and the chronology unreliable.<br /><br />Definitely a humor book, so how much you like it will depend on whether you like Mr. Pratchett's sense of humor.  You can definitely see the characters based on the Gray Mouser, Conan and the Dragonriders of Pern.<br /><br />Of all the characters, my favorites have to be The Lady, Death, and the Luggage.  Who wouldn't want a trunk with hundreds of legs, indestructible, opens to another dimension apparently, can find you, and will eat anyone that gets in its way.<br /><br />This is a steal at 99 cents, for as long as that price remains.

B004W4N55C|5.0|I downloaded this because it was free, but it is worth the paid price. It not only has a great tab library, but a great chord library as well. This app is well put together and I highly recommend to players of almost any level.
047158651X|4.0|This book pulls out all the stops and is an outrageously flamboyant parade of X-ray crystal structures and organic chemistry. Dr. Voet is a crystallographer, and I am very interested in biophysics myself, so I completely understand where this book is coming from. For every enzyme, major emphasis is placed on the X-ray crystal structure, and long, convoluted explanations follow as to how its structure helps accomplish its function. I swear there is an average of at least one crystal structure per page! Quite often, copious amounts of organic chemistry get hauled in to explain the reactivity of an intermediate, and several passages read like they came out of an organic synthesis text.  However, this is totally overkill for an introductory course in biochemistry, where all one wants to know is the names of enzymes, structures of products and reactants, and a little bit about regulation. Voet's text has less information on regulation and how biochemical pathways fit in with physiology than competing texts such as Garrett and Grisham or Lehninger. I am glad I did not have this book for undergraduate biochemistry, because I could not have seen the forest for the trees.  Overall, I cannot help but be rather amused when I read this book. The graphic design is hideous (as is par for advanced physics/math textbooks), and the excruciating detail that the author slams you with gets predictable and humorous over time. Is this seriously a biochemistry textbook, or a metaphysical statement as to how difficult it will be to completely explain biochemistry in terms of physics and chemistry?  Regardless, this text is an excellent reference for when I want a detailed explanation of a single enzyme or concept. I would hate to actually have to learn biochemistry for the first time out of it, because there is so much excruciating detail!

B004ZJADNQ|5.0|This is by far, and heads above all of the discs they put out in their career. Scott Gorham had to do alot of the guitar work, with Brian Roberstons in and out situation with the band, but what a album they created. All I can say is, that no matter where you are, or how bad or good your days is going, slide this into your player, you get swept away by the darkness and warmth of Phil Lynotts lyrics and the bands weaving, woving, hypnotic grooves. This album should be in the top 25 of any Hard Rock Albums of all time. Alas the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame could not even figure this out. Thousands of Irish/Americans get it. Is there anyone who what any Irish in them? Get this disc.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|I personally find this movie better than the first one. There's more music, more dancing. BUT.   There are flaws.  As in, the bros weren't related in the first one, but they were in the second one.  I sense a flaw? I do.   \\"The whole reason I'm here- The whole reason my BROTHERS are here- Is to get to know you better.\\"   Oh, Shane. You're stupid.

0385535139|1.0|There are just too many books on my \\"unread\\" shelf to have wasted my time trying to finish this boring, repetitive book. It started out so promising but I wasn't even half way through when I just wanted to scream if one more \\"cost\\" of something was brought up. I finally decided at page 190 to skip to the last 89 pages and even then I found myself skimming to the last predictable page. Thank goodness for new authors and genres to explore because the old \\"greats\\" have failed to write anything good for ages. Actually I should rephrase that as recently I find myself buying and loving more and more books by the true \\"old greats\\"!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you think deregulation works to your benefit, you are an idiot; if believe you have control over your life, you are a stupid; if you believe your hard work would bring you prosperity then you are a fool; if you think you could have the American dream, you're a moron; if you think I am going to give you a piece of my pie, you'll have better luck eating the crap from your toilet.  If such comments don't piss you off, then this film is not for you.  These comments are not part of the film, but their sentiments cannot be missed as you watch how it plays out against you.      How the film makers managed to explain the housing bubble ponzi-scam so simply, accurately, and thoroughly makes this one of the best documentary out there.  You have an obligated duty to watch this film, rent it, borrow it, buy it--watch it and get everyone you know to watch it.  If everyone watches this film, the current system of governance would not survive.  There is only one part I would change, it is the last few words in Matt Damon's ending narrative, he should have said \\"...some things you MUST fight for.\\"    Fight for this:  - zero campaign financing, take a dollar, mandatory, from every tax payer annually (est. collectible amount $200m) to pay for a Internet Candidates Website (ICW); viewers can click into any of the candidate webpages to review whatever the registered candidate have to say at any time   - zero private lobbyist meetings, all presentations are to be conducted in a hearing room setting with at least three members of legislators must be present, selected randomly, and all hearing sessions are to be opened to the general public  - enforced strict \\"conflicts of interest\\" regulations in include fines (you stole a million, you pay a million plus cost of prosecution, interest lost on amount, etc.) and mandatory imprisonment of no less than three years, or we could make it one year for every million, if found guilty  - all government agency heads are be elected by the general public instead of being appointed by the President    - we want these investment firms' decision makers prosecuted  - and if a corporation is considered to be a person than we should sue them like a person; if any deaths occurred as a direct result of these human-corporation activities then charges of man-slaughter or even murder should applied--[I need to check this--if anyone know, please post.]  - all who invested with these firms should also sue the CEOs personally, let them spent the money on lawyers    Just some ideas.  You should email your demands to ALL of the U.S. Congresspersons (Senators and House of Rep. in both parties). You'll have to split up your email in batches (20 at a time) cause there are a lot of names.  I'll post the list here in a later update--by November 20th, 2011 for sure.  The list is huge, I might have to split it up in batches of comments/posts.  So check back then.  If for whatever reason I cannot upload the list, you could get started now, here's the House of Rep website[...] and Senate [...].  Can you picture the impact if just the three hundred people here who rated this DVD send their one email in--and having how many of your friend do the same?      This is the effects this film had on me.  What can it incite in you?  Somethings, you must fight for.
B003ELOQCK|2.0|I want to premise this review with the proviso that I have seen U2 live on every tour since The Joshua Tree (with the exception of the Lovetown Tour), sometimes twice in the same tour.  I have all of the concert DVDs, and I have seen a lot of bootlegs.  In short, I am a big fan.  That said, I have three different problems with this DVD.  First, there is the band.  U2's performances have been going slowly downhill since 2001 (e.g., tempo of the older songs), and while the 360 Tour offered up a lot of songs that have not been done in years, Bono's vocals are really deteriorating (e.g., Ultraviolet).  And then there is the random mix of songs that just don't go that well together - just for the sake of having a mixed up setlist every night.  Long gone are the carefully constructed setlists that actually had some flow to them (e.g., ZooTV and PopMart).  One thing that I used to look forward to in subsequent U2 tours was re-working older songs (e.g., The Fly on the Elevation Tour, Discotheque on the Vertigo Tour, Bullet the Blue Sky on ZooTV Tour).  For the first time ever, I can safely say I cannot name a single song from the catalog that was done significantly different on this tour (e.g., Elevation complete with intro and acoustic Stuck in a Moment, same as last time).  Second, there is the stage set.  ZooTV and PopMart were big, but big with a purpose or a message.  Apparently, the message here is: we are all taking off in a claw-shaped spaceship?  THAT has something to do with 'No Line on the Horizon' or any song on that new record?  Furthermore, the video accompaniments to the songs enhanced the experience in prior shows since 1992, but in continuing the trend begun in 2001, most of the video is now devoted to giving everybody in a huge stadium a closer look.  Third, there is the DVD package itself.  The omission of the first song from the concert from the concert film itself (it's an extra on Disk 2) - \\"Breathe\\" - is inexplicable.  With the lights up, Larry Mullen, Jr. walks out alone to the drum kit and begins the drum solo.  Great moment - lost.  In fact, overall I was not thrilled with the editing or the cold camera work.  Did any of you people who gave this DVD glowing reviews actually watched 'Under a Blood Red Sky,' 'Rattle & Hum', 'ZooTV Live in Sidney', 'PopMart Live in Mexico City,' or even 'Elevation Live from Boston' recently?  In doing so, I cannot believe you wouldn't find this DVD to be depressing.  U2 are starting to resemble the post-1980s Rolling Stones.
B00447G29S|1.0|I have to start by saying I love this movie and watch it each year at Christmas time.  However the 3D effect is terrible.  We started watching the 3D version with great excitement but after 15 minutes we were forced to switch back to 2D so we could still enjoy this movie.  Save your money and stick with the 2D version.
0321687299|2.0|My only sincere suggestion is that don't buy this book on Kindle. I purchased my Kindle more than one year ago, and I love it. I have noticed that Kindle is great for non technical and non how to books. HTML5 might be a good book, if I had it in the print format. I am just unable to get any benefit from it using the Kindle edition. Earlier I had purchased Window 7 book also on Kindle. Similarly, it is unusable. I tried two books, this HTML5 book and Windows, both proved to be useless on a Kindle.  I think I wasted that money, but I learned a lesson.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|considering the subject, expected this to be more dynamic, a better read.<br />it's (mostly) a laundry list of accomplishments, each one bookended by \\"jobs was difficult, mean\\" and \\"jobs was visionary\\". so, a bit too black-and-white (for me, anyway).<br /><br />still...fascinating stuff. some good behind-the-scenes anecdotes, a few surprises.<br />definitely recommended reading, for apple fans, AND future (and present) CEOs...<br /><br />EDIT: just docked one star because...weeks after finishing this, i get an email from amazon that there are some fixes, and i can re-download the kindle edition. this happened with neal stephenson's \\"reamde\\" as well.

1451648537|3.0|The book was an easy read and held my interest all though the timetable jumped around way to much.  Also had only a few photos.....I understand that Steve Jobs gave his blessing as well as many interviews to this author so I believe what he wrote was true...What I found was an ill mannered, ill tempered, egotistical, back stabbing, cry baby, phony, narcissist,  that most definitely suffered from severe bi-polar disorder...I was unimpressed with his spiritual quest, his taste for acid, his lack of hygiene, his lack of empathy, his inabillity to show sincere kindness to any one, his obsession with a vegetarian diet.  His quest for HIS idea of minimalistic perfection in everything was unbearable. Even the simplest of tasks like choosing a couch or a washer and dryer became painful to read about. He allowed his historical home to fall into dilapidation out of spite as they would not let him tear it down. He was not interested in philanthropic endeavors.  I mostly disliked everything about him.  It appeared, to me, that he was little more than an idea man, a GOOD one with an uncanny ability to mesmerize, infatuate and manipulate people not unlike cult leaders, religious evangelists and serial killers. Reading about his last years of life was disturbing and sad....When I started this book I thought to myself, How can one thank the person that made it possible for me to carry all my music, books, photos, and access the internet on one small device in my pocket?  I feel his best products/ideas were produced in the last years of his life and these items are INCREDIBLE  but very sadly I find myself disliking him and he would dislike me as well....He did however give music and musicians a fighting chance with iTunes, thank goodness......Book was downloaded and read on my iPad2 which synced to my new iPod touch and iPhone.  Review was written on my 2011 MacBook Air... Oddly, with much respect and love...Soar in iPeace SJ

0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is one of my top authors, love his stuff, read Blink and Tipping Point, and again he does not dissapoint with his insightful material that just puts things in different perspectives that just make too much damn sense.  You may end up getting a new spark of confidence to feel that you can make things work for you and act upon opportunity; and if you can't you will feel fine too because maybe it just wasn't meant to capitalize on certain things due to the place and time you were born in.  Cultural Legacy is I believe the most important concept spoken that our Educational institutions should implement and be able to provide that to a child to be able to perform better in life, regardless of the socio-economical background.  Regardless, a great read!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|We saw this movie in the theatre still wanted to watch it over and again. Good blu-ray presentation and the digital copy is great to have for travel.
0739377779|4.0|This book is a great fast read that touches upon many topics of life that brings things to a perspective, allowing you (at least for the moment) re-think your own life, makes you step back and see how in fact we are so caught up in our day to day lives going at 100 mph.  Great book, recommend it to anyone that needs a brief (not in-depth) refresher of life.
1591391105|4.0|The book lives up to its promise. Although many of the techniques are obvious, the book presents those in clear and concise manner. This is a complete book on the subject. No pep-talk, instead a clear framework for transition that you can use to create your own transition plan. Make sure you note down the points as you read the book. It's a quick read as well; it took me a week to finish (3/4 sittings). I feel much certain about my success in new role thanks to this this book.   The reason I give this book only 4 stars is that some chapters are only for senior level managers viz. \\"Achieve Alignment\\", \\"Build Your Team\\", \\"Expedite Everyone\\" and to some extent \\"Match Strategy to Situation\\". If you are new to management, you may just skim through these chapters.   In all, a good read before joining a new job - be it managerial or non-managerial. I recommend it without any hesitation.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|All in all, I spent 12 hours beating this game, and I loved just about every minute of it. This is not just a game to play when you're bored in the car, or at the doctors office. I spent hours in bed playing this because it's genuinely fun. I got it as the free app of the day, but have since purchased some of the devs other games which I'm currently playing. I mean, 12 hours of fun for $2? Try finding anything else fun that costs less than 20 cents an hour.   The only downside is that the dialogues can be cheesy at times, but this is such a minor aspect I feel that this game still deserves 5 stars.
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|It's a good one.  This dictionary understands various wordforms, which means you can really use it to translate something inside a German text by highlighting words.  It does work, unlike \\"German-English Reader's Dictionary\\" by Victor Saase, for example.  The price is a bit too high, perhaps, but if you keep it in mind that cheap versions simply don't work - well, it's worth the money then.

B005NJ2K6U|1.0|The game itself is decent but it has some serious bugs. I played the first couple levels and then I got the black screen of death. now every time it loads I only get a few seconds before it freezes again. It sounds like I'm not the first this has happened to.
0062068423|5.0|I am finding that Jo Nesbo is a welcome change from authors we have writing the crime novels in America currently.  Even though I am just now discovering him, his writing has brought another part of the world alive for his readers. I look forward to reading his other works as soon as they are translated into English.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I am normally not interested in stories about spirits and the departed, nor can I find the conviction to attach importance to the reports that we receive sometimes about 'near death' experiences, which are often claimed to have been post-death experiences, by people who came back to life.<br />I gave this film a chance, because it is 'made' by Eastwood and it stars Matt Damon. That, I thought, would at least guarantee that it is not outright stupid. It isn't.<br />Actually, once you start with the beginning and the South East Asian tsunami pulls you in, and the heartbreaking story of the London twin boys with their addict single mother, it is hard to walk out, though Damon's part (the psychic)tries hard to demotivate me.<br />We have three threads in Paris, London, and San Francisco leading to a unified ending via a London book fair. Whatever the realities behind the ghost world, Clint tells the story well. The hereafter might very well be a genuine concern of his, as it probably is for many of us. I can't quite manage to be convinced that the so-called near-death experience is what it is claimed to be.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|this movie was all in all very funny, i think the chemistry between the main three (bateman, sudeikis, and day) was a really good combination, and in realistic terms these three would of screwed up as much as they do in the movie. the other three main characters (spacey, aniston, and farrell) were good but i think the only screwed up boss is spacey, aniston plays a very sexual beast that wants charlie days character to \\"have fun with her\\" and she plays about every part shes in good and this is the first time you really see her act like this in a movie which is refreshing, not only is she hot, but she has the same type of role in a lot of the movies she is in. farrell doesn't get as much screen time as the others but has his good one liners 'as you see in the commercial' and the whole apartment/coke scene was one of the best things in the movie. i think the actor that i thought brought the movie together was charlie day he was an awesomely funny person, and without him this movie would of been a bust his high pitched voice makes me laugh everytime i hear it, and there is one certain part where he is in the car (on drugs) after the whole cokaine incident where he is singing to the song \\"that's not my name\\" by the ting tings, it is such a funny part everytime i think of it i bust out laughing. this movie for me was good it started slow but picked up when they try to find a hitman. yes this movie's idea was takin from an old movie, but how many of us were alive to actually see that movie? well not a lot, anyways it shined this movie was good, and i recommend this to about anyone that does think of killing their boss and everything is better when you relate to it. watch it.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|fell for 5* hype and rented it (so glad didnt buy or see it in theaters)  like other 1* reviewers have waited till 1/2 way of the movie to see if its gets interesting...so bad, no plot, average action....the GIJoe Cobra movie had better plot and visuals  returning it unfinished as its utter waste of time

B004LWZW7O|4.0|In the future \\"time is money.\\" Literally. People live to 25 years old, after which time they have one year left, then they die. The good news is that you can buy time and live forever, but only the rich can do that. Everyone else is struggling to stay alive. Currency is done in time, transferred by computer chips installed in the forearm. A cup of coffee will cost you 4 minutes of your life. I kept thinking about \\"Logan's Run\\" as I watched this film.<br /><br />The cliche possibilities are endless and they are not shy about using them. \\"All the time in world.\\" \\"Got a minute.\\" \\"Too much time on my hands\\" \\"Who's got the time?\\" \\"You must come from time.\\" \\"Taken years off my life.\\" \\"Drank his life away.\\" \\"Too much time in the wrong hands...\\" \\"I had the time to buy one of these.\\" \\"Thank you for your time.\\" \\"The time he has taken.\\" \\"It would take a million years.\\" Ouch!<br /><br />\\"Hey big spender, spend a little time with me.\\" \\"I'd give a year of my life just to spend an hour with her.\\" These didn't make the cut.<br /><br />Timberlake plays Will Salas, a man struggling to pay the bills and stay alive along with his mother Rachel (Olivia Wilde). Will saves the life of a rich man who was 108. He wanted to die. From him we get the class warfare speech of the movie. Many must die so a few might live. Taxes and prices are raised to make sure the poor die. Like most science fiction features, they have a social commentary.<br /><br />While Will was asleep, the rich man gives him his time so he can die. Rich people literally live in a different \\"time zone\\" so they don't get mugged by those who work for the weekend.<br /><br />Timberlake is 5 stars in comedies, but as a dramatic actor, he was unconvincing in this role, which may have been the director's fault. Will is supposed to have passion to distinguish himself from the cautious rich. He lacks, he should have never been in that role (Keanu Reeves spoiled us). Timberlake would have been more convincing as a rich tycoon. Much of the acting was stiff by design, but that made for a bad movie. Other than the time devices, the technology was circa 1985 with no pay phones, 80's automobiles, and no cell phones.<br /><br />No real sex or nudity. One f-bomb.r a bad movie.

B004EPYZPI|4.0|It's been a while since there has been a decent courtroom drama, but happily now that one has come along, it turns out to be worth the wait.  Matthew MaConaughy is the titular purveyor of legal expertise, which he does not from an office of leather topped desks and imposing shelves full of legal tomes, but rather from the back seat of his Lincoln.  It soon becomes clear that he is quite happy to represent anyone at all, indeed that this may even come from his conscience - his greatest fear being that he might have the responsibility of defending someone who is actually innocent.  It's an interesting and satisfyingly explored twist on the usual moral-high-ground style lawyers we usually see in these movies.  However his next case defending the rich Ryan Phillippe character, turns out to be challenging both to his sense of what he knows is right, and a challenge to his skills in out-manipulating.  All this leads to some satisfying courtroom scenes, and perhaps does not hold too many genuine surprises.  Except perhaps for the biggest surprise of the movie - a remarkable return to form for Maconaughy, after years in sub-par rom-coms, his first return to the courtroom since [[ASIN:B0019NG7GI A Time to Kill [Blu-ray]]] makes you wish he'd never left. He certainly holds the movie together, far outshining the lesser role given to Ryan Phillips.  Which is not to say his is the only good performance, surrounded by an assortment of top notch character actors (Marisa Tomei, John Leguizamo, William Macy and others) adding a real sense of reality and grittiness to the movie.  I liked it, and I recommend it.  It loses a star for a certain level of predictability and a less than charismatic performance from Ryan Phillippe, but still gets a solid 4 stars on the basis of terrific characterization and interesting spin on the courtroom drama formula.

The humor is fast and witty. The man Paul is replacing was \\"artistic\\" and \\"raped to death\\" by sailors.<br /><br />Paul Kemp is a Hunter S.Thompson clone. He was hired because the editor likes his style of writing. He is placed in charge of writing horoscopes, something he makes up. He describes the obese Yankee tourists as \\"great whites\\" the most deadly creature known to man. They are afraid to venture outside of their hotel, spending their days bowling, gambling, and duty free shopping. The more you spend, the more you save. His writings tend to be cynical.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart is a wealthy mobster/businessman, Amber Heard is his free spirited gf who causes everyone grief. Aaron needs a writer (PR man) with new eyes, and Paul sets his bloodshot eyes on Amber, a woman who considers clothes optional. There is also criticism of today's conservatives as Paul remarks about Nixon, \\"Some day some filthy hoar-beast will make him look like a liberal.\\"  While watching the Nixon-Kennedy debate, through a pair of binoculars on a neighbors TV, Paul is able to predict a Kennedy victory because \\"I do horoscopes.\\" The humor is off-beat, cynical, and hard hitting like Thompson.

B005KAJPY2|5.0|If the world suddenly became perfect (whatever your vision of that is) and all of your favorite heroes took charge and sent every villian to a penal colony on mars, this album is what they'd be playing at the party that night.   Grandeur, Titanic Glory, It should be titled- Exhaltation.  So much of VNV in the past was in my opinion, stitching up the wounds of our souls to keep us going. Fighting thru the darkness alone, towards a distant dim light.   Looking back at my favorite VNV tracks of the past, I realize now that they have been all a kind of prayers that I uttered alone in silence to strengthen me in the the darkest times of my life to find the strength I needed to survive, to find solace. I felt, like so many of us that VNV captured the Zeitgeist of our dark age of this last lost decade (or two or three.) Read the comments on youtube for your favorite track. The music of VNV has been medicine, plain and simple.  But then I remember that the only constant in the universe is change. And all I need to do is look around to see the changes all around us the days (Worldwide political revolutions, OWS, end of Iraq and Afganistan). We are approaching its shores.   Accordingly, it is this new Zeitgeist that Automatic heralds here. their music captures that. Look around us. The glory, the power, the perfect machine of cadence and sound and for the first time...dare I say it? The Sacred Hope, of promise fulfilled, that permeates the album it left me in tears on my first listen struggling to keep my car on the road. (Do not drive on the first listen, I'm warning you. I was choking crying and laughing all with my mouth open in amazement.(email me the name of another album that does that).   I hear an indescribable wonder, a gorgeousness, an exaltation to be alive and awake. It's as if we fought and traveled like Odysseus for a life time and finally landed on the shores of home. VNV drives our flag into the sand and claims it ours.   I never write reviews. But after I read a review written here by a very intelligent person here trashing it I couldn't be silent. (darklord zen from Australia drew my attention by his 1 star rating). Let go of your pain brother. Im truly sorry for your suffering. Open your heart. Come out of the darkness. A new world awaits you, its all good.   A new world is dawning. Their album is a celebration of it. The songs here are prayers. Sung at the top of Ronans lungs.   Let us all sing with him brothers. For the world is yours.  \\"O Wonder, O brave new world, that doth have such people in it.!\\"- Shakespeare  -----  Add to cart right now.   And cough up a few dollars for overnight shipping.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I read the book and really enjoyed it, so I was excited for the movie. It did not dissapoint!  I thought the movie was very well done, kept to the book pretty well.  I felt like it represented the characters very closely to how I pictured them.  Overall a good movie! I bought it and am glad I did

B005IZLPME|5.0|I saw Captain America in the movie theater when it first came out. My wife and I don't go to the theater that often, and I can't remember the last time we saw a movie when it opened. The house was packed and we were lucky to get a seat.<br /><br />I really love this movie, in an age when so many movies are so overdone, this is a simple but powerful movie. This might be why there are some people complaining that they were bored. Although, the crowd that we saw the movie with was on its feet cheering at the end of the movie. A simple movie about good versus evil. A hero who is intelligent, modest, and compassionate. The idea of fighting for something larger than yourself or for your own interests, and making sacrifices. To see a crowd of mostly young people cheering enthusiastically at the end of a film you would take your children or grandchildren to see was about as satisfying as the film itself.<br /><br />This is a contrast to movies like the last Transformers move (Dark Side of the Moon), where the action is so overdone it seemed like the planet was destroyed five times over before Sam Witwicky saves the day, after surfing falling buildings with hardly a scratch.<br /><br />If you like seeing movies try to outdo each other with over-the-top action and special effects - this movie isn't for you. If you can't enjoy a movie unless the plot is highly complex, you should skip this one. Although I still think it would be a pity to miss such a beautiful story of pure goodness and courage. I will be buying the DVD, unless it physically malfunctions, I know I will enjoy watching this movie again.

Old Man's War (2005) 2. The Ghost Brigades (2006) 3. The Last Colony (2007) 4. Zoe's TaleJohn Perry is 75 years old, his wife is dead, and he has nothing left to live for. It's a perfect time to join the army, and the Colonial Defense Force is recruiting. They need a lot of loyal human bodies to maintain the universe colonization project, so their preference is to recruit old people, rejuvenate their bodies (nobody on Earth knows exactly how this happens), and train them to fight for the human race. Most of them will be dead within a few years, but that's all they were expecting on Earth anyway. The Colonial Defense Force gives them something valuable to do for humanity, and a chance for a new life.<br /><br />Old Man's War is one of the most enjoyable novels I've read this year. The premise -- old people being rejuvenated -- makes for an excellent twist on the usual alien-fighting theme. The elderly, as opposed to the usual young heroes we find in so many speculative fiction novels, have had a lifetime to accumulate knowledge, skills, wisdom, and experience. I found John Perry and his cohort to be mature heroes whom I could admire and enthusiastically cheer for. I cried for them, too, as they lost each other or ruminated on past loves. Perry's explanation of why he missed being married was moving and reminded me of my graduate school days when I would have felt lonely and unsupported (and maybe quit) if it hadn't been for my husband's presence.<br /><br />Scalzi's villains, on the other hand -- all those alien creatures -- are absolutely horrifying! The humans usually have no idea what they'll find on a new planet, which is why their mortality rate is so high. It could be an insectoid creature with razors for hands, or a jumping slime mold, or a virus... The diversity of alien life that Scalzi has created adds suspense and terror to his story.<br /><br />Old Man's War is not a comedy, but it's often funny -- very funny. I laughed hard and out loud many times. William Dufris, the narrator of the audiobook version I listened to, contributed to the humor by reading the funny parts in a perfect deadpan voice. Dufris was outstanding and I highly recommend Macmillan Audio's version.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading John Scalzi's other books in this series.

B004Z29X3E|5.0|Martha Marcy May Marlene is literally one of the most difficult movie titles to remember in recent memory; at least until after you see the film. Shortened to MMMM in movie conversations, when you tell people that title their reply is usually along the lines of, \\"That sounds REALLY stupid.\\" But Martha Marcy May Marlene is pretty much the furthest thing from stupid a film could possibly be. But then if you were try to convince somebody that a movie starring a younger sister of the Olsen twins is not only good but filled with some pretty extraordinary acting, you'd probably be laughed at. If you enjoy independent film, watch the trailer for Martha Marcy May Marlene and go into the full-length film with an open mind. It's practically guaranteed you'll be surprised with what you discover.<br /><br />Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) has just returned home to her family; Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and her husband Ted (Hugh Dancy). Martha disappeared two years ago without a trace. She never called anyone or let anyone know where she was going; she was just gone. Now that Martha has returned, she doesn't seem right. She acts strangely and can't tell the difference between the past, the present, and events that she dreamed about. But she doesn't want to talk about it. She did however live with a man named Patrick (John Hawkes) on a farm with a group of other women who basically worshipped the ground Patrick walked on. But whatever happened there has tainted Martha. The events that transpired there still haunt her to this day and Martha soon comes to realize that the life she had for two years isn't so easy to run away from.<br /><br />Martha Marcy May Marlene reels you in right from the start. You see Martha take off into the woods and the shaky point of view that's used along with the positioning of the camera gives you the sense that you're chasing after her, which is basically what you're doing the entire film. There's this constant sense of uneasiness dripping over each frame of the film even before anything is actually revealed. The absence of a score does wonders, but every once in awhile a slow rising high pitched tone can be heard to make things more tense and it works in spades.<br /><br />The film itself is rather upsetting and almost off-putting in a way. It's incredibly difficult to watch at times, but hard to pull yourself away from at the same time. Elizabeth Olsen is an interesting actress to watch. She spends the majority of the film keeping to herself and not wanting to talk about the hell she's been through the past two years, but her unusual behavior along with how insanity begins to slip through the cracks of the front she puts on in front of her family is the beauty of not only the character but her performance as well. John Hawkes has always been a compelling actor anyway, but he's in top form here. Patrick is a very driven individual. Of course, the way he lives and his ideals are completely off the wall but it's the way he's so calm about it and so confident that makes it believable. Then there's his dark side that's just downright scary. The whole scenario brings to mind a famous serial killer; a certain family from the 1960s.<br /><br />However like most movies the less you know about Martha Marcy May Marlene going in the better. One of the film's charms is how it transitions between the past and the present. It illustrates to perfection the thought process and current mindset of the Martha character. Marcy's Song, which is performed by John Hawkes, is a beautiful song but its context is genuinely creepy. Most of the conversations between Martha and her sister Lucy are some of the best scenes in the film. Their conversation by the lake while Ted is making dinner is one that stands out. You find yourself just enthralled with the film and just entranced with everything going on, but the ending is kind of a letdown. It's very open-ended and was obviously done to keep you talking (which it has done very successfully), but it didn't feel completely satisfying to me. It doesn't necessarily hurt the film overall, but is just a small nitpick on my end.<br /><br />Martha Marcy May Marlene is driven by an exceptional cast and an engaging story while being wrapped up in an incredibly unnerving presentation. There doesn't really seem to be a weak actor in the cast as Elizabeth Olsen shows she's a very talented actress and John Hawkes continues to show how talented he really is. Martha Marcy May Marlene keeps you guessing, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is just brilliant storytelling all around.t doesn't necessarily hurt the film overall, but is just a small nitpick on my end.

B0018PH3L0|5.0|I'm a big movie fan and have seen just about every notable Western out there.  I have some favorites - some 50's & 60's classics like The Searchers, High Noon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence.  I loved True Grit (both versions) and Unforgiven (and most Westerns Eastwood has directed or been in), Once Upon a Time in the West, Dances With Wolves, Silverado, Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, The Wild Bunch, the Magnificent Seven.  Even cheese like Tombstone and Sam Raimi's The Quick & The Dead.<br /><br />But, really, while a lot of those films are great and some are true classics, nothing compares to Lonesome Dove, for me.  Maybe it's a bit unfair because Lonesome Dove has the benefit of being 6 hours long.  It makes the most of that time and tells a truly epic story of the old west that spans many different lives and lifestyles, reminiscing about the West as it was and foreshadowing some of what it will become.<br /><br />It's got so much going for it - not the least of which is the superb writing - the deep, interesting characters and the genuinely engaging plot that weaves in subplots as compelling as the main story.  The dialogue is minimalistic, but perfect.  The whole feeling is one of stark but moving realism.<br /><br />The acting is impeccable (with only a couple exceedingly minor characters feeling like the kind of acting you find in most other westerns) with the standouts being an unrecognizable Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow Call.  Both have the best roles of their careers in this movie, I think.  And Duvall has said that this was his favorite role he's ever played (and it shows).  A young Diane Lane does a fantastic job as well.<br /><br />The whole production is first-rate, especially when you remember it's a TV miniseries from the late 1980's.  Even the music is wonderful - by the great Basil Poledouris.<br /><br />The epic scope, gritty realism, fantastic acting and compelling story make it an unbeatable movie in my mind.It's simply the best western ever made that I've had the pleasure of seeing.
0307396789|5.0|After seeing the movie I had to read this book.  Usually I don't like reading the book after I've seen the movie if I haven't already read the book previously.  However, this was an exception.  This book is so heart (and gut) wrenching.  The movie that is based on this book is likewise.  It is so well acted and directed it has become one of my all time favorites.  A beautiful, emotional, movie.  The book filled in all of the extra details.  Make sure to have a hanky handy.  The story stays with you long after you've finished it. The story is able to wring emotions from the reader with little effort. Will you be forgiving or angry at the end?  I totally sided with Robbie and Cecilia.  Like them, I couldn't forgive the girl for what she did. (yes, they are characters in a book--but you will find yourself drawn into the story before you know what hit you). The book is not a fluff piece of writing. Some will find it slow, but there is much depth to the characters and the story is thought provoking. The story tells of the consequences of a lie and how it destroys lives and relationships. Readers who like to \\"analyze\\" characters will have a field day with this one.

0143038419|2.0|This book was a gift to me so thankfully I didn't spend my own money on it.  Normally I don't read self help or \\"soul searching\\" type of books so I guess that's part of the reason I didn't like this book.  I found it to be a chronicle of a well to do woman's journey of \\"finding herself\\" only on a huge budget.  She decides she doesn't want to be married anymore and takes off for exotic places to figure out what she should do with her life.  Now some of it I admit was interesting especially the India experience with the culture, meditation, yoga, etc.  But it was really hard for me to identify with this author and find any empathy with her.

B004386KUY|1.0|I'm of the belief that [[ASIN:B00000J7J4 Supernatural]] was NOT a Santana \\"comeback\\" album, because it's impossible to \\"come back\\" if you never left in the first place. \\"Supernatural\\" was a Clive Davis / Carlos Santana move to make some noise on the charts and parlay that into a massive payday, and if you consider that to be \\"success,\\" then I guess they succeeded. Personally, I've gotten to the point where I react to \\"Smooth\\" the same way I react to Starship's \\"We Built This City\\"...yes, I know every word and note. No, that doesn't mean I want to hear it for the zillionth time.   When I think \\"Santana,\\" I think the first three albums, or [[ASIN:B005M4K94G Caravanserai]] / [[ASIN:B0012GMV58 Welcome]] / [[ASIN:B0000027D5 Lotus]] / [[ASIN:B0000AKY7M Moonflower]]...and THAT is where you will find \\"Guitar Heaven,\\" not on this crass attempt to pick the pockets of baby boomers who can't make it through the day without yet another version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"  Don't get me wrong...there is a time and place for \\"cover versions,\\" and Carlos has certainly proven that with his career-best pairing of Peter Green's \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and Gabor Szabo's \\"Gypsy Queen.\\"   The three \\"mortal sins\\" of this album are:  1). This is far from Carlos at his \\"best\\"  2). The song selection...as much as I appreciate \\"out of the box\\" thinking, the project is sort of like Bob Dylan's most reviled album, [[ASIN:B0000024W3 Self Portrait]]...Carlos should never, repeat, NEVER, tackle an AC/DC song again. You make an album like this when you're Brett Michaels, not Carlos Santana.   3). The \\"guests.\\" OK, I can handle Joe Cocker, Jonny Lang...but Chris Daughtry? Scott Stapp?   Carlos HAS produced very \\"commercial\\" albums that were also filled with artistic merit (case in point, [[ASIN:B0000025EB Inner Secrets]], and its cover versions of Traffic's \\"Dealer,\\" Atlanta Rhythm Section's \\"Stormy,\\" and Buddy Holly's \\"Well All Right\\"), but this isn't one of those albums. It's too cold, it's toocalculated, and it lacks the jaw-dropping passion and intensity of Carlos at his best. Maybe there are folks out there who enjoy seeing him paired with second-and-third stringers, sleep-walking his way through a half-hearted set list of baby boomer \\"classic rock\\" favorites. I'm not one of those people.  Carlos, since re-teaming with Clive Davis, you've made a boatload of money. But now it's time for you to ACT \\"hungry\\" again, even if you're not. You need to be like Larry Talbot in \\"The Wolfman.\\" When the full moon comes up you need to start howling and go out and create some DAMAGE.  One star. Period.

0385738773|2.0|The only reason I'm not giving this book one star is the quality of writing was mostly good. I'd only give one star if the book had no merit. The plot, character development and resolution of conflict however was terrible in my opinion. My wife and I both had very high expectations after book 2 since there were still so many questions unanswered with numerous twists and turns to make our way through but we both felt robbed with the conclusion of book three.   SPOILER ALERT  --  SPOILER ALERT  Through book three you get a little bit of background into Thomas' previous life through memory flashbacks but not much and absolutey nothing on any of the other characters. You are also left wondering about the previous relationship of Theresa and Thomas but other then knowing they had feelings for each other prior to the mind wipe you know nothing else.   Some of the closing scenes were total rubish in my opinion. The last fight scene between Thomas and the other main characters and Rat Face and a group of henchmen was stereotypical and shallow. Just before the heroes escape the arch nemesis shows up with an ensuing melee fight to the death; how convenient.   Then as the heroes are finally escaping, James Dashner realizes, we can't have Thomas and Theresa and Brenda together so bam let's kill her off really quick.   We also discover that WICKED has had the ability to literally control a person at any time. Thomas' escape from the complex now doesn't make any sense at all. Why didn't WICKED simply control him to restore his memories? And for that matter, why restore anyone's memories anyway? It didn't appear to affect anyone's behavior or personality.  And lastly, although I could go on and on, the last sentence of the book KILLS ME. WICKED is good. Bull! Just because the chancellor and two accomplices decide finally to help Thomas and his friends find a new life that doesn't in any way make WICKED good. How about .01% of WICKED is good, while 99.99% will continue to try to kill you. That would be more accurate.   I like the idea of Thomas and his immunes starting the human race over. I think that is a fitting conclusion to the zombie apocalypse but where did this magical green land come from? How convenient it is that it pops out of nowhere in the final few pages to change the utter depression of most of the book into a happily ever after.   All in all I think James Dashner had a great concept with the books but the quality of the story fell sharply with this last book. I also feel the quality of the writing suffered at the end also which sadly can be the product of an author trying to wrap things up quickly.  Although I really liked book 1 and mostly liked book 2 I would never recommend them to a friend because in my opinion the series as a whole fizzled in the end.

159514188X|4.0|This is one probably one of the very few good books I've read in a long time. The writing was spectacular and so was the structure. It may be a little confusing at times but you see it so often that it starts flowing in a natural pace. I'll admit, I read this book in one day because I just couldn't put it down. First of all, the plot is intriguing and new. Hannah, a girl who has recently committed suicide sends cassette tapes to Clay, who used to have a crush on her. There, on the tapes, she explains the thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life.   Asher does an amazing job putting the raw emotions that both Clay and other characters experience while listening to Hannah's tapes. The pure intensity he puts into his writing is brilliant and you definitely feel like you're right alongside Clay, going through every feeling with him. It gives a very much appreciated realistic perspective if something like this would actually happen. The pain, the affliction, the cruelty, and even some emotions so strong that I can't even describe are all packed together in this amazing novel that in the end delivers a strong message. That is that suicide is a very real thing and it affects very real people. Also that we don't know how far our actions can go, maybe even affecting someone's life forever. It really makes you think about the things you've done and you start wondering if you've ever done anything in YOUR life to affect someone as dramatically as Hannah.  Anyways, this was a great book and as I said before I read it in one day because I couldn't bear to close it. It was well worth spending my entire day over though and I would most certainly recommend this book to YA readers.
B003X5UFWW|4.0|A combination of action, drama and elegance.  The story line begins in the mid-1930's to relay a mild-mannered and humble man with great talents and elegance in the mastery of Chinese Kung Fu.  Soon with the impending war between the Chinese and Japanese, he and his family are taken through very dark times and great hardship.  Classic Asian perspective of drama, with some spectacular martial arts and the bonus of being based on a true story.  Highly recommended!

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I would recommend this book to everyone, singles.. teens.. couples.. parents.. everyone. In this book you will learn how different people express their love and how they feel love. For example.. my mom loves us by doing things for us. Sometimes, I used to get annoyed when she cleaned my room. It not only made me feel guilty but I thought she was invading my privacy. Now I know that this is how she expresses her love. I learned that touch is how I feel loved and show my love. My wife prefers quality time. Hopefully, having this information will help in my future relationships.<br />Book is easy to read. There is some christian tone in the book but it is not preachy. I as a Muslim think all of the passages qouted from bible were beautiful and universal.

B0001UL7RY|3.0|I purchased this CD years ago when I was really into Avril, Fall Out Boy, and pretty much anyone like them. I also happened to have a gift card and found this CD cheap so I figured why not? Looking back now, it's one of those CDs I have in my collection that are just sitting there. I managed to get it free, I don't mind most of it, but I'm not crazy about it and I don't really listen to it anymore. I've grown out of my teen agnst years and have matured to artists like Within Temptation.<br /><br />I think out of all the songs on this CD my favorite would be the last song Avril has. I think it's a sweet, sad song. But other than that, a lot of the CD is filled with mediocre songs that are forgetable. If you absolutely love Avril, I say go ahead and purchase the CD. If you're one who has randomly come across this by either amazon suggesting it or a friend, I would think twice. Borrow it from the library first to see what you think. It's not entirely bad, but it's not good either. As my title says, it's average.

I thought this was a good CD for Mariah. I love the more dance type music she has and it's a CD that I listen to all the time. I haven't listened to it in a while, but it's not a bad CD. I'm not going to say it's her best because I'm still in love with older Mariah but it is pretty good.

There are more songs I enjoy on this CD than Gwen's first CD. At the same time, there are a couple songs I didn't enjoy as much. But overall, enjoyable CD. If you love Gwen or No Doubt, I'd say check this CD out. I will say, however, there are a few songs that don't have that \\"No Doubt\\" edge and a bit more \\"pop\\" flavour to it than No Doubt did. Other than that, it's a good CD.

B003XCVQ3C|1.0|This item did not fill my expectations. I wanted to connect my imac to my home theater to see and hear on my tv whatever i was seeing on my imac on the internet. So this was a total failure, i can only see it. Not hear it. I wish i had more information before I bought it.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I got this as an Amazon \\"Today's Deals\\" and I couldn't be any happier for the purchase.  I am watching the set with my 5 year old and he is hooked.  It is so much fun to watch something other than cartoons that the youngsters appreciate.  This set has it all for any Superman fan!  So far we only watched #1 but I am anxiously awaiting watching the rest with my little boy.  The price is a bit high for their normal price but if they put it back on as a deal, DO NOT HESITATE to buy it.  Very happy purchase!

0062011847|5.0|Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors of all time. The Sam Vimes series is one of my favorite as well. I think that he really expanded Sam Vimes character in this book- showed a side of him that you only really guessed about. I am not sure how many Discworld books there will be after this, but if they are all as good as this one, it will be well worth the wait!

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|OfficeSuite is best way I have found so far to work with and manage Office docs on my mobile device.  OfficeSuite makes editing a breeze and the integration with Google Docs is seamless...  Better than their native app.  Great work!
B004LROUNG|1.0|Unoriginal plot.  Same plot as previous books and movies.  Story is too similar to \\"The Verdict\\" with Paul Neuman.  The author made little effort to create a new book.  I get the feeling the book was made just to make money and not to provide any original thoughts.  Grisham's lack of understanding of the legal world comes across as narrow minded.  I enjoyed most of his books but those of us who purchased \\"The Litigator\\" deserve a refund of the purchase price.
B003VYAVGA|5.0|I had to go back and dig out my sisiter's old CDs from the 90's to somehow recall the old Take That records and compare them to the new album.  \\"Everything Changes\\" and \\"Nobody Else\\" is classic boysband sound from the 90's. Nightmare, no wonder I didn' remember any song from that era.  But new one... Oh boy, what a Progress literaly. What the difference this is.  Every song has unique style, great modern sound, nice lyrics. No more choir boys. It's men now. According to wikipedia they sold over half million of the album in the first week. I can't get enough of it. Simply, I love it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I purchased this Nicholas Sparks book for my Kindle. I love his books and hope to read more very soon. As always this book held my attention. I finished it in two days because I had to see what was going to happen next. I loved the feelings of true love these two people had for each other. You may feel you know what is going to happen in the end, but, you will be surprised. It will bring a tear to the best of us. I thought the title of this book was perfect, \\"The Best of Me\\". I don't want to ruin anything for anyone who wants to read this story, but be prepared for lots of action. There are some nasty people involved in this beautiful love story. Young love, parents who disaprove and years pass by. Get ready the suspense will make you glad you picked this Nicholas Sparks book to read. A great way to relax and pass some peaceful time. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did, even though things don't always turn out just as we would want them to. I believe in neverending love &lt;3
1423140591|5.0|The book was awesome, as Rick Riordan's books always are! It was suspenseful, though a bit predictable at parts. The ending is a huge cliff hanger and leaves the reader wanting more! Can't wait for the next book to come out!
1602521123|5.0|I LOVED this book! I just couldn't set it down. The story was very unique and it is a one of a kind book. It was nice to have pictures too which gave me a more vivid image of what the author wanted me to think the characters looked like.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I was looking through the product to see where my husband and I were in the series (watching on BBC) and to see if there was anything regarding the series we hadn't seen and I could get him for Christmas. I was reading season 3 (where we are in the series now) and saw season 4.5 gave away a few SPOILERS I did not need to see!!! I don't understand why reviews and program synopsis have to give away pertinent information. Yes, this is an old and completed series but that does not mean everyone has seen it.  Other than that, We are enjoying the series immensely.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|These movies are fantastic. Those that gave it bad reviews didn't even buy it. They're are whiny little fan-boys that cry if there's anything new added. I enjoy the movies - all of them - and all the revisions. And the bonus disks along are worth the price if you are a true Star Wars fan.

B004ZN9UZO|5.0|great to hear this masterpiece with the clarity and definition its always lacked.  were a long way from analog and vinyl which were the template at the time of its release.  the remastering is brilliant,second to none....a nuance laiden album comes to life......  ....you gotta sleep on your toes,and when you're on the street..you have to be able,   to pick out the easy meat;- with your eyes closed.  ..cant afford not to have a copy of this!

B0011UBDTK|1.0|bought the boxed set and was looking forward to a satc marathon.  some of the discs skipped and froze so i called amazon about it.  turns out the manufacturer knows the discs don't play well in all dvd players.  how about either not selling it or posting that information so people can make an informed purchase decision?  v disappointed with amazon on this one.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|At first I shared the same view that many others do about this album. Its terrible, lou reed ruins it,crappy instrumentals, etc etc. Upon further listening I realized that this may be the most creative album ever made. The lyrics are truly epic,haunting and masterfully written and the fact that its primarially spoken gives it such a lifelike real quallity. Its not just another concept album. Its an experience. I also appreciate that no other album in the world sounds like this. It will never be confused with anything because it is completely original and unheard. Ever since the black album metallica has been critisized by their fans for thinking outside the box. This further proves that metallica isnt trying to play it safe, they are being true musicians and i salute them for it. This album is a test of openmindedness. if you hate it, you are a simple creature. If you love it, you are a well educated and thoughtful person

B004J2TPSI|1.0|I'm really disapointed with this particular item as I thought it would detect & sync my Iphone 4 with my stereo component via the 3.5 stereo jack. So what the use to have a bluetooth accesories that doesn't detect any bluetooth device.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought these headphones to use for extended amounts of time at work.  They are extremely comfortable and the sound quality (good treble, deep bass, loud) is far better then I expected for the price.  The in-line volume control is a nice addition too.  On a aesthetic note, I believe the headset is constructed beautifully and the cord is different then most headphone cords.  It seems more flexible and durable.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone; you won't be disappointed.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I heard M Night Shamalan was great at twist endings, but he really proves it with this one!  In this classic, he starts off with the mystery of \\"Who is Rosebud?\\"  The story goes on for a long time building solid characters and slowly filling in the life of Kane.    ***Spoiler alert***  Then after building everything up (especially suspense) we find out from Kevin Spacey that Rosebud is Keyser Soze.  Man that cop never saw it coming.  And the way that the falling coffee cup with Kobayashi on the bottom smashes, just like the snow globe:  BRILLIANT!  I watched it several times just to piece everything together.  It wasn't until the third viewing I caught that Brad Pitt and Ed Norton were, in fact, the same person who was terribly allergic to water.  This is truly a masterpiece.
1936719118|4.0|This book is about Derek Sivers's journey while creating and operating CD Baby, from the first lines of code he wrote to selling the company and putting all the money in a charitable trust. Reading this will not make you rich overnight, and it won't make your company the next Google, but it will give you a sustainable philosophy for running a business. Siver's company embodies the mantra of getting rich by filling a need, not by squeezing every last nickel out of your customers. His screwups are teachable moments, from his dad owning 90% of the company by accident, and his employees giving all the company's profits to themselves. This book is a worthwhile read for the would be entrepreneur or business owner, and it will  not take up too much of your time.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|We rented this movie due to the positive reviews and cast. It was trying to be way too artsy, with mostly whispering monologue and dialogue, funky camera angles, and a roundabout plot with little character development. We were very surprised at how lousy this flick was, and decided to eat the cost after only about 15 minutes. Yes, it was that bad! :(
B000F6IOC0|3.0|So, these Lycans and werewolves, and their old dad, are immortal, except they can be killed by blowing them up? Or tearing their heads off? Makes no sense to me. Wouldn't they just regenerate? The first 30 mins of this silly dark and dreary mess are a complete muddle for non-experts. Having not seen any of this series before, I was lost. Not good. If you are making these, anyone should be able to drop in and make sense of it from the start. This needed better editing and/or a better script. But in the makers' zeal to make everything here move incredibly fast, they lost track of storyline. To be fair, the plot and the characters manage to sort of come together after awhile. The color of this is almost all blue and black and white. Very dark. I also don't get why something called UV bullets can slow down these immortals. Aren't they supposedly indestructible? Haven't they been around for centuries? Yet, here they can suddenly be destroyed. HHmmmm.....
B005DZMP00|5.0|The original E72 has always been a favorite.  This one is just as good.  Jerry is on fire.  Me and My Uncle, Greatest Story, Bertha...  Disc 2 has some of the long jams.
B0058A119G|3.0|I enjoy listening to Barbra Streisand very much.  The vocals are good on this CD, but all of the songs sound the same.  Same tempo, voice inflection, etc.  It was good, but I needed a little more from it.
0316056863|1.0|Reading this book from cover to cover was a struggle. My conclusion is that it is one of the worst books and a complete waste of my time.  My advise to Tina is to keep up being a commedienne.
B002WJI63A|5.0|Princess Peach is definitely worthy of collecting. Everything about this little lady is adorable, from the jeweled crown on her head to her red heels.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have purchased another office app then got this one free from amazon. This app is so much better. Visually it's more appealing. The functions are easier to use. The price even though it's not free anymore is still great. I would recommend this app over any of the others.
B004LWZW24|4.0|I don't consider myself a horror expert, but I do like to watch horror films quite a lot. When I first saw the trailer for Insidious I thought it was just another silly franchise grab by the Saw creators. To me, James Wan and crew had finally jumped the shark with this one. But I was pleasantly surprised when I found that Insidious is a really classic haunted house movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has some great scares! Especially considering that most horror movies nowadays (the Paranormal Activity sequels, not the first) are mostly about surprising us rather than scaring us, it's good to have a movie with genuine suspense and good payoff. I actually jumped several times! The third act is a little silly, but the ending is worth it. Overall Insidious is a very well made and creative haunted house movie that has some great scares and a fun story. Remember that guys? Fun? Don't get me wrong, this isn't a perfect movie by far, but on the whole I recommend at least a rent because I had a great time.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|Some reviews had mentioned that it works with the original iPad...my experience was different...on connecting my iPad with the TV HDMI input, the video shows up for half a second and then just stops displaying...guess it s a safer bet with iPad 2 per the product description.
B0054N73EY|4.0|Well I'll just say that I barely feel qualified to write this review as I really only turned on to RHCP when Stadium Arcadium (SA) released. From there, I bought the Greatest Hits album which I find to be a mixed bag of hits and misses for me. So having been more biased toward the Stadium Arcadium, I think this album is very much a hit. I enjoy the melodic RHCP songs (Charlie, Breaking the Girl, Desecration Smile, Hey) over the hard hitting ones (Suck My Kiss, Give It Away, etc.) Having said that \\"I'm With You\\" (IWY) seems to be more of the former with everyone who hears it saying \\"That's RHCP?!\\"   IMY is a great and easy listen start to finish. I'm told the guitarist from SA is missing in this effort and it definitely shows. On IWY, you simply don't get that killer guitar work you used to get on tracks like \\"Charlie,\\" \\"Otherside,\\" and \\"Hey.\\" And this is something you'll probably notice and very much miss. If you can get past that, I think you'll find the rest a great listen. You just have to be open to the softer side of their music.   Tracks with the highest play count: \\"Brendan's Death Song,\\" \\"Look Around,\\" \\"Did I Let You Know,\\" and \\"Dance,Dance,Dance.\\"
B00009Y3L4|5.0|Great service and a great product.  I had the movie in VHS. When the tape broke I had to get it on DVD.  I am really glad I did.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Listened to this CD about five days prior to making a review.  Wanted to understand and feel the essence before submitting a review.  Sadly, this is an album that so many people love to hate and make fun of.  So Metallica team up with Lou Reed.  All I can say is I come from the zone of being a Lou Reed fan and yes, have respect for Metallica surprisingly more and more as the years go by and they try new things.  Both of these artists have an incredible mindset where they tend to create music to satisfy their artistic ambitions.  I don't think any of them care what their fans think.  Metallica can put out anything with their name on it and sell a lot of it because they have legions of devoted fans.  I can't call myself a hardcore Metallica fan but, can say enjoy the career of Lou Reed ever since, he was in the Velvet Underground.  Ok enough of that here is my review of the album.  It is amazing.  This is what Rock N' Roll is about.  The opening track \\"Brandenburg Gate\\" opens with lyrical references to Werner Herzog's Nosferatu, Klaus Kinski and Boris Karloff.  This CD runs deep.  It is based on an opera where the characters are Lulu and Jack the Ripper.  Fun thought provoking CD.  Why this album does not have parental advisory I don't know.  Lou Reed is lyrically at his sharpest hardcore wit.  The lyrics ramble through all of our cultural Taboos and truly are thought provoking.  I am having fun and a laugh knowing the Metalica fans are out there listening to this so angry and impressed that some of them really give it a chance and buy the album to have a listen.  Too songs that really stick out are Iced Honey which sounds kinda has a \\"Sweet Jane\\" vibe.  But, yes I would actually rather listen to \\"Iced Honey\\" than \\"Sweet Jane.\\"  I also love the beautiful closer \\"Junior Dad\\" I still don't know what the song is about completely but, it conjures up so much about compansion and existence I never tire of listening to it.  Some of the other songs, like \\"The View\\" are I'll admit a listening challenge and \\"Little Dog\\" is so discusting.  And simply put there you have it.  This CD is never boring.  This CD represents what music should be about compassion, wit, dumb, crazy, taboo, beauty.  I love love love this CD.  In a month where so much new music is coming out.  I keep going back to Lulu.  I've seriously listened to \\"Junior Dad\\" about 30 times and it is one of my favorite songs ever.  I truly never listen to many songs more than once or twice.  So, for me to listen to a 19 minute song that much.  Well, that says something.  Some parts of this CD remind me of Suicide's \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" in that they are jawdropping hardcore.  Isn't that what Rock N Roll is about.  I see this CD as a misunderstood masterpiece.  However, in reality I think it will bridge the gap between Lou Reed fans and Metallica fans.  I was ignorant.  I'm a Lou Reed fan that usually steers clear of mainstream music like Metallica.  After hearing this and seeing how open minded they are in their interviews and thought processes I have been out buying new and old Metallica thanks to this gem of a collaboration.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Greatly anticipated, this is the last book/video and chapter of Harry Potter's Life. One really doesn't want the series to end but all kids grow up sometime and that time is at hand. Harry has to endure some grewsome times and it seems that Voldemort will win. But, never fear, all of Harry's friends and even family show up for the final battle. You will be on pins and needles for this one.  It is sad that everything comes to a close but all questions are answered and good triumphs in the end. A very satisfactory close to the most popular children's books in history.
B000B8QG22|5.0|I don't know how factual this biography of Adrian Cronauer is but it is funny. Great music. One of my favorites. Some of the scenes remind me of his standup routines. You really have to pay attention to the fast-paced talking. Probably not a good movie for kids under 16-17 to watch. A few embarrasing comments but they fit in with the movie.
1401324517|4.0|Rafa is enjoyable to read. The book consists of nine chapters. Each chapter consists largely of Nadal's own narrative, written in the form I and a small treatise on Nadal by journalist John Carlin.  The common thread in Nadal's narrative is the historic Wimbledon final of 2008, the course of the game and what's going on in the mind of Nadal. Because that's what Nadal stresses all the time, it's all the spirit that determines who ultimately will win and who is a loser. Throughout the report Nadal talks about his childhood, the relationship with his family and especially about Uncle Toni. It's all very nice to read, to understand the spirit of Nadal. Drawback of the book is that it is very repetitive. Spirit and family, at a certain point you know it. The nice thing is that Nadal is trying to be honest, he cautions not something \\"negative\\" to say about Uncle Toni. The divorce of his parents is, though briefly, discussed. At the end even his girlfriend is mentioned. The last two chapters are about out 2010 U.S. Open, Nadals Career Slam.  Each chapter there are nice additions by Cronin. Very sweet and positive, but as a ghostwriter, you can expect nothing else. Unfortunately, it was limited to 3 or 4 pages, it's interesting enough to be there more.  All in all, a book that delivers some enjoyable hours and leaves you with more knowledge of Nadal.

B004W4N55C|5.0|I just recently redownloaded the amazon app store after removing it following the news around Pocket Casts and mediocre app of the days. This app makes me happy to have downloaded the store again.   It does what it says it does without any unnecessary distractions. It's not obvious by the app title, but this is the app for the ultimate guitar website. Ultimate guitar is pretty much the place to go on the Internet to get tabs for several instruments - also included in the app. Whats great is that the interface is better than the website. Considering all of the different books you can buy with tablature for a higher price, the expensive price tag of 8 bucks for this application is worth it.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I have been doing workout videos for the last 15 years and am a long distance runner. I have NEVER had problems with my knees. I did this video for one week in August (it's now November) and I couldn't walk for the next week. My knees stiffened up to a point when I sat down that people were asking what my problem was. My knees still give me problems. Unfortunately, my health insurance has a very high deductible, so I have delayed visiting my physician. I just hope like many of the other reviewers, that I will not have to have surgery. If you have great health insurance and can afford the risk of being out of commission due to injury - go for it.<br /><br />In addition, Amazon should not be putting the good reviews first. It should be listing the reviews as they come in, because it's misleading. This is a dangerous workout (just read the one star reviews, which have people's doctors or other exercise professionals telling them so) that suggests performing moves that could lead to serious injury if not performed correctly and there is not explanation of how to perform the moves during the workout. It erratically jumps from move to move without condiseration.<br /><br />In the future, I will stick to Denise Austin, Trudy Styler, and Mari Windsor. They take the time to properly demonstrate moves and are way more effective.
B005WY8YZW|4.0|What a relief from all the droning and the zzzzzzzzz of Puscifer's first few efforts. This one was well worth the wait, and Maynard goes back to singing, which is what he does best!  I'm so relieved, and so should you.
1585104205|5.0|About: Hans Henning Ørberg: Lingua Latina per se Illustrata, Pars I: Familia Romana.<br /><br />This is the best Latin textbook I have ever seen!<br /><br />However I think it is suitable only for adults, not children. For children it would be too time consuming to try to understand the meaning of the words only from the context. Being an adult I was able to understand the exact meaning of 95 % of the words only from the context, and even in the other 5 % I understood the approximate meaning. (In this 5 % I used Google Translate to see the exact meaning of the words.)<br /><br />I found only two negative aspects in this textbook:<br /><br />I. The exercises at the end of every chapter are not enough. It is absolutely necessary to buy Exercitia Latina I from the same author too.<br /><br />II. The lack of almost any explanation of grammar makes too difficult to understand some of the grammatical rules. Yes, it is possible to understand 80 % of the grammar from the context, but sometimes this is too time consuming. And 20 % of the grammar is impossible to understand correctly without any adequate grammatical explanation. I had Lingua Latina per se Illustrata: Latine Disco, Student's Manual (from the same author) - there is a proper grammar explanation for every chapter. So do not buy this textbook without the Student's Manual.<br /><br />In every other aspect this textbook is simply the best. Interesting texts, good methodology, gradual introduction of new grammar in every chapter.

1416955070|2.0|I have no idea why this book series has gotten such high ratings. The only reason why I even bothered to read it was because two of my friends were raving about it and promised me that it would get better in the later books (it didn't). It's very unimaginative, predictable, and poorly written with absolutely no build up to the major scenes. The main characters are completely unrealistic: Clary is an idiot, Simon is too trusting, and Jace is moody. The only redeeming part of the book is the sarcasm. It was very boring and I had to force myself to finish reading each book.
0812974611|5.0|I read this a few years back and I agree with many of the respondents that it skews overwhelmingly historical; but there IS a place for that.  As long as you know you are getting into a novel that will feed your mind as well as your emotions - and arguably at the expense of your emotions - you'll be amazed at what you'll discover here.    I hesitated suggesting this book for my wife back then because I thought it too fact-focused, but she just finished reading it and, as a result, we've ordered several more titles by this author.  So...if you want a little knowledge with your bran flakes, this is a book for you.
0307719774|5.0|I got one for my husband and one for myself and though we may skip a day here or there we have done pretty well in keeping up writing because it takes only minutes out of your day and they are wonderful to compare answers sometimes and I think it will be even more wonderful as our lives change together and apart.
0061784788|4.0|An enjoyable read with historical facts about founding fathers.  Lots of action, but could he make the niece any dumber. Usual Sigma drama, so you know what to expect if you have read his books before. Good read, not great.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I accidentally picked this up just because I was intrigued by the name.  While I am an adult, the book is written for young people.  However, I have to disagree with this in part, because it is a learning experience for any age.  The plot slows sometimes, but the slowness is relative few, and I suspect is designed to give us a \\"rest\\" on the journey these two children take along with the adults who accompany them.  Sometimes, though, the writing seems to be older than the characters' ages.  But, regardless, it is an excellent book for any age.  The children are more grownup than their peers, obviously.  The knowledge of the Egyptian gods is excellent, interesting, and sometimes, downright believable.  Imagination is the key to this book.  You have to have it in spades.  You don't necessarily need to have a history degree, either.  I have a more than basic knowledge of the Egyptian/Greek gods, so I was very familiar with the names and who most of them were in Egyptian Mythology. But, you don't need to have this.  Riordan does a great job of letting us know about them as he weaves the story around.  I recommend this book for 8 years and up, as well as for adults who are young at heart.  However old, or young, one is, the truth is that inside, we never age.  Great book.  Will be getting the 2nd in the series.
0553582038|4.0|Martin slowly continues to build his massive Ice and Fire story arc, but takes a break from the character set of the first 3 books to do the job. I found that I missed my favorite characters badly!! (Bran, Danaerys, Jon, Tyrion, Davos... and Arya barely appears) However, the switch to other points of view gives the reader a fuller perspective. The oceangoing \\"Ironborn\\" men, and the Dornish desert peoples (the wettest and driest of the 7 Kingdoms) come into focus, and their subplots with them. The Braavosi, previously only mentioned in obscure references, also come into the increasingly complicated big picture.   In the first three books of this massive series, I found that the characters Martin uses to tell his story were mostly (though not entirely) \\"good guys\\". While Catelyn shows a bit of unfairness, and Tyrion's innately kind nature is at odds with his family loyalties, all the characters whose voices Martin uses are people that the reader can identify with, and root for. This changes completely in Feast. Martin does an excellent job of putting the reader right into the mind of several repellent characters. However, we still get the occasional second person glimpse at the missing characters and story lines.   While I found this book slightly less enjoyable than the first 3, it is no less compelling. I will continue to read everything that I can lay hands on that relates to this series!
0307341569|1.0|I don't understand all the five star reviews. I really liked the beginning of the book....I thought the writing was  really good at first. But I lost interest after the first chapters. It got very slow. I skipped a lot, especially the mother's and Ben flashbacks.  It was also a very unpleasant book to read as all the characters are unpleasant. The end was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT.....It would have been a lot more powerful if the author had committed to Ben's involvement rather than introducing a random killer.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Without question in the top 5 of all Bond films. Some folks have had problems with the DVD do to Sony :( I have had computer problems with Sony as well when they used a program called secure rom. Either way buy this Movie in some format was amazing! Quantum of Solace was terrible though don't buy that one!
B002UM5BXW|2.0|I'm almost halfway through Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" and am putting it aside to read something else.  He is totally self-absorbed.  What I thought was going to be an insight into restaurant cooking is actually insight into how great he truly thinks he is.  I find the book dragging along with very little humor, other than his sarcasm.  Others who have worked with Bourdain could, no doubt, tell a few good ones on him as well.  He refers to far too many unfamiliar cooking techniques and gourmet foods, making it difficult to find interest in.  His gloating of drugs, alcohol, sex, etc. are something he should be more ashamed than proud of.    I will not delete Kitchen Confidential from my Kindle library but will eventually finish the book.  For now, I am tired of his self indulgence and prefer to move on to a more interesting and enlightening read.  Mr. Bourdain needs to reassess his image and clean up his act.  My biggest disappointment was spending money on this book.  However, the greatest highlight is that I purchased it as a Kindle Daily Deal, so my investment was minimal.....much like the book.

0451169514|4.0|My experience with It in some ways parallels the plot of the novel. I first came across it when I was twelve, about the same age as Bill and the other protagonists. My sister was reading it and told me about the storyline. In fascinated horror I read a few snippets, put it away and then struggled with bad dreams for quite a while. I have thought about it off and on since then, but it wasn't until 18 years later that I finally sat down to read it fully - to face It.<br /><br />It is a shape-shifting demonic character who inhabits the drains and sewers underneath the small town of Derry in Maine. Every 27 or so years it emerges from its mysterious depths to prey upon the children of the town with brutal force and malicious glee. It's most characteristic form is of the sinister Pennywise the Clown, but It generally takes on the shape of its victim's deepest fears. In 1958 seven friends, 'Losers' who struggle with abuse at school and alienation at home, band together to try to destroy It. They believe they have succeeded, but make an oath to return to Derry should It ever re-emerge. So in 1985, when the killings begin again, they come back to face It, and much more.<br /><br />The strength of It as a novel is King's absolute pitch perfect evocation of the terrors and joys of childhood. There is a reason that this story haunted me for so long. The fear of something that waits in the dark, underneath the normal world, something that will devour you, is a fundamental experience of childhood. And indeed it is a shape-shifting fear that lights upon wolves, spiders, trolls, strangers, and even clowns. Part of growing up is mastering this unreasonable fear or at least reconciling yourself to it. But reading it in my late twenties I was surprised that the deepest emotion in It is not fear but rather sadness. Sadness at the loss of the luminous experience of the world that we have as a child in favour of the rational and routine adult world. Sure an adult does not worry about amonster living down the drain, but neither do we madly ride a bike down the hill as though we are wild west heroes and can 'beat the devil'.<br /><br />As many have said, the ending is not entirely satisfying. The cosmology behind It is interesting but skates towards an absurdity that undercuts the seriousness of the story. And like many I also wonder whether several of the scenes are not beyond the pale of good taste.<br /><br />Anyway, It is a remarkably scary and surprisingly poignant novel and a masterpiece in its own niche. I am glad that I finally returned to returned to reckon with It after all these years.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|The TK41 by Fenix is an outstanding light - Amazingly Bright, Uses AA cells, Convenient (separate) buttons for on/off and mode selection, Compact and light, remembers the previous mode, comfortable grip, water resistant, efficient LED that helps with battery life. (Don't intend to test the water resistance if I can help it!)  Some flashlights have awkwardly buttons placed, or use twist to select modes, or forget the previous modes when you turn them on each time. Fenix has made sure TK41 does not suffer from these drawbacks and is a very convenient light to use. All I miss is a momentary on by pressing the switch lightly (My D-cell Maglite has this - but does not compare anywhere close in terms of brightness).   The lowest mode is good enough for everyday use. Take care you do not flash it on anyone's eyes even in the low mode - it is quite bright. In Turbo mode, just do not shine this into someone's eyes even by mistake - the light is absolutely blinding. You can use it very effectively on an intruder you would like to discourage/protect yourself from - there is no way they would be able to keep their eyes open, or see you once you turn the light on. This is one of the reasons I got this untra-bright light  Overall: the best light you can get (period)

1609611543|5.0|This is a great book.  It is a complicated book to read, but it has given me hope for a \\"normal\\" life.  I stopped eating anything with wheat as soon as I read the first page.  I went through a mild detox since I don't eat much bread anyway.  OMG !!!  Can we actually convince a whole nation to stop eating wheat?  I have convinced my adult children to stop eating wheat.  My daughter wants to read the book after me.  I'm getting them for Christmas presents for my family.  I've only been wheat free for about a week.  This is a must read for everyone who wants to control their health.  Though it can get complicated, you can take the book to your doctor.  Wait until you've been on the diet for a couple of weeks and show them how well you are doing!  I've already started to lose weight.  I don't have the food cravings at night like I used too....

B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is the best comic book movie to be released this summer. That is what it is, a comic book movie. It does not surpass that level but nobody ever said it had to. While not a Spider-man 2 or Dark Knight it fits in well as a first entry in an inevitable series. Perhaps not the fun, turn the formula on its head, film that Iron Man was, it is still an excellent comic book film that manages to have developed characters and a story actually propelled by plot rather than CG sequences (I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and 3). Still, even with all its positive attributes the film might've been largely a one time viewing for me, that is, if it hadn't been for Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter.   My personal, and largest, issue with comic book movies has been their seeming inability to cast memorable and talented women in the leading lady spot. While the leading lady role has frequently been nothing more than a damsel in distress (other than perhaps in team up movies such as X-men), something unfortunately true even of Nolan's gritty Dark Knight films, here we find that is not the case. Peggy Carter is a female character who stands out amongst the many comic book movie female characters. She is strong willed, independent, can handle herself, never asks for help, doesn't take any crap and does it all in a period where women were undeniably treated as less than men. She does all these things yet she can still walk into a bar in the middle of the film wearing a red dress that leaves everyone at a loss for words.   Even better than Peggy Carter's character, and the reason I named the actress rather than the character in my review title, was the casting of Hayley Atwell in the role. The character could have become something much different without a capable actress to play the balance of tough yet feminine. Worse it could have been filled by some less capable big name actress for box office draw. For years in comic book movies I have either dreaded or at best barely stomached the casting of female leading roles.   Kirsten Dunst had her moments in the Spidey films but then would come the time when she had to be kidnapped and scream and holler for help, she also always needed a man in her life, if not Peter then another stand in to take his place. Batman Begins casting of Katie Holmes always seemed strange to me, why in a film full of lower status but credible actors would Nolan cast a more household name with much less credibility? Whatever the reason, she played the part but it is not the role anyone remembers from that film. The same goes for the sequel, in which I had high hopes Maggie Gyllenhaal would make welcome changes to the previously pitchy character, unfortunately I dare say that Rachel Dawes only became more helpless and became the one negative to be found in The Dark Knight.   More recently I was disappointed to find Gwenyth and Natalie both playing supposed strong women but one (Pepper Potts) who is subordinate to a man who treats her badly and still needs to be saved in the end and the other (Jane Foster) fairly shallow and school girlish overall.   While Jane only likes Thor at first because of his muscles, Peggy meets Steve Rogers/The Cap when he is a ninety pound weakling. We see her first tinge of interest in him when he is still this small, all based on his philosophies on fighting and dating. It is this established connection before he becomes a perfect male specimen that cements the story and keeps us truly engaged. Peggy and Steve truly bring out the best in eachother and actually share a common bond of struggling to break free from their respective stereotypes that allows the audience to believe in their relationship, one that is actually formed out of friendship first. The film is great and a wonderful starting point for a series, the ending is unique if only a plot device required for the Avengers tie in and I truly can't wait to see where they take Captain America in his sequel. He has by the end of the film, especially thanks to Peggy Carter, become quite a different hero with quite a different chip on his shoulders than any we have yet to see.   So I have wondered why comic book movies don't cast relatively unknown actresses to play these parts and allow them to really create a character. Finally Captain America has done just that with the lovely Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and I hope we see much more of it in future comic book films. The saddest part of Captain America and perhaps the thing that compells me to want to see it again Repeated times is that based on the ending it is very unlikely we will see the fantastic Peggy Carter/Hayley Atwell in all her glory in any of the sequels. They have some big shoes to fill when they inevitably try to create a Sharon Carter character, let's hope they take cues from however it was that they came to choose Hayley.   **By the way, I would like it if Hayley or someone like her played Wonder Woman for DC, brits are already playing supes and batman might as well fill in the big three with a third, and let's not only have a more obscure actress with talent but one who can fill out the costume properly, no stick thing actresses such as when people were rallying for Megan Fox to play WW.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I've just finished listening to \\"Lulu\\" and I like it. Yes, Lou Reed, who was never much of a singer, basically croaks and growls the lyrics while Metallica's metal roar is sometimes overwhelming, but overall I think effective and it creates a fierceness that enhances the mood. I understand most of the music was done in one take, so it's got a more live feel,which I like. The story Lou is telling is ugly and violent, like real life, and not always pleasant listening, but no one was aiming for \\"nice\\" on this project. I remember when Lou Reed released \\"Berlin\\" in the early 1970's most of the criticism I saw was negative, but now that album is considered a classic. This is true Art-Rock, or at least a noble attempt, not music for everybody and they aren't trying to be popular. If you want that go buy a Justin Bieber record.
0515142247|4.0|I am reading the Jack Reacher novels in order, so \\"Die Trying\\" is my second one.  In this book, Lee Child improved on his first effort (\\"Killing Floor\\") by creating a female character who is more than just a sex partner for his main hero, Jack Reacher.  The female cop in \\"Killing Floor\\" frustrated me, because she stood around passively waiting to be carried out of danger by Jack Reacher.  But Holly Johnson, the female FBI agent in \\"Die Trying,\\" does a fair amount of courageous, skilled fighting against the bad guys, even though she is hampered by a pre-existing knee injury.  She wins the admiration of all the male cops in the story.  Holly is altogether a better developed, and more likeable, character than the female lead in \\"Killing Floor.\\"  On the other hand, I found the love scene between Holly and Jack in \\"Die Trying\\" to be improbable.  Their coupling takes place under circumstances that I believe are extremely unlikely to allow for sexual arousal, at least on the woman's part.  Specifically, Jack Reacher had just dug a six-foot-deep, six-foot-long, and three-foot-wide hole in the dirt, using a hand shovel, to bury a crucifixion victim, with Holly and about a million flies watching him.  Jack must have been utterly filthy, I doubt the flies left the area immediately after the body was buried, and I certainly could not have gotten past the disgust and shock of seeing the body as quickly as Holly must have, in order to be ready for sex with Jack just then.  I recommend that Child seek some advice from a female editor, to improve upon his scenes between Jack Reacher and the women in his novels.    One of the strengths of a Lee Child novel, IMO, is his detailed descriptions of processes the reader is unlikely to know anything about.  In \\"Killing Floor\\" it was the process of counterfeiting US currency, which I thought Child handled extremely well.  In this book, \\"Die Trying,\\" Child explains the capabilities and drawbacks of several different weapons and kinds of ammo, and writes in detail about all the things a sniper has to adjust for when s/he is planning to hit a target that is 1,000 yards away.  These include gravity, the curvature of the earth, and the shooter's own breathing and heartbeat.  Most of this is interesting, but I got impatient with the amount of detail Child wrote into his discussion of things I think should be obvious to a person of average intelligence -- for example, that wind direction and speed will affect the trajectory of a bullet.  I felt this should have been trimmed down a bit, although I didn't have a big problem with skimming over those parts.  I was able to guess the answers to some of the mysteries from the first clue or two Child gave, but others remained mysteries to me until the answers were explained by the characters in the book.  Overall, this book provides several hours of great entertainment.  If you like a lot of action, a hero who is able to employ psychological manipulation as well as his fists and weapons to fight the bad guys, and solving mysteries along the way, I recommend you read this.

1439102732|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. A history of Flamstead Hill is needed to appreciate the story. I think the author did a good job providing the needed background at the beginning.  As the story unfolds it gets difficult to put the book down. The ending is enjoyable, as the storylines of the characters are connected. I saw a potential for good in Henry. I'm glad he was honest with Florence. I too hope to see a sequel.
B00002R0MC|5.0|My 4-CD box set arrived yesterday (thanks BlowItOuttaHere!), and today I listened to all four discs -- no track skipping.  Before you read my review, don't torture yourself like I did and read lots of reviews, even listened to the musical samples  -- just buy the 4-CD box set and come back later to read the reviews.  By the time I got to Three Little Birds on Disc 3, I couldn't wait a minute longer.  I simply had to order the set!  And I can unequivocally state that I do not regret this purchase.<br /><br />The easiest way to begin my review is to state the only negative -- the packaging of the CDs; however, that can easily be fixed.  The discs come in a cardboard jacket with nice pixs of Bob.  So, I went to Staples and bought some jewel CD cases (not slim ones) and trimmed the jackets to fit.  On the front is Bob's pix with the number of the CD, and on the back are the song list and the liner notes.  There is a also a very nice brochure that came with the CDs.<br /><br />I was first introduced to Bob Marley's music -- \\"Legend\\" -- CD sometime around 1998/1999.  I loaned that CD to a neighbor and never got it back.  I bought another one.  This past May, that CD was stolen during a family event.  Little did I know that particular version of the CD was no longer in production.  I was devastated.  My mood lightened when I bought the newest version several months ago of \\"Legend -- Collector's Edition (Remastered),\\" only to be not merely disappointed but also disgusted with the CD.  But, to be fair, I did listen to that CD all the way through today -- and, I couldn't wait for it to end!<br /><br />\\"Songs of Freedom\\" is way too complex to review.  There aren't enough accolades or adjectives within my vocabulary to do it justice.  Bob Marley weaves sensuality/spirituality/philosophy/political activism -- raw emotion -- through his music and his lyrics.  Disc One has songs that clearly demonstrate each of these emotions, and these emotions prevail on all the discs in the set.  It's a bit tinny in sound, but that CD represents the 1960s -- and, I'm sure Bob and the Wailers didn't have access to great sound equipment or engineers.  But, rest assured, from Disc Two - Four -- the sound quality is fantastic!  Although I had to crank my volume up a little more, it felt like I was right there with Bob Marley and the Wailers.  This CD set is, simply put, -- FANTASTIC!  I no longer care that my \\"Legend\\" CDs vanished -- I now have the best!  And, I'm going to guard them with my life!  This is obviously another re-issue but true to Bob Marley and the Wailers, but it could disappear again and come back in the newly-mastered remix version!  Perish the thought.  I'm tempted to buy another set (just as backup!).<br /><br />If you love Bob, this CD set will make you love him more -- I highly recommend it.  I heard songs I'd never heard before -- especially the early years (in the 60s).  Disc 3 starts with a live version of \\"No Woman/No Cry,\\" -- and I was blown away.  Awesome.  It's far superior to the version on the Legend CDs I had.  I was musically transformed to that performance -- right there with the crowd.  I'm going to end this review, but if you really love Bob, do yourself another favor and buy the DVD \\"Bob Marley The Legend Live -- Santa Barbara County Bowl, November 25th 1979.\\"  He's thinner, but not only do you get to hear the essence of Bob Marley, you get to experience it as well.  I'm sorry that I was introduced to Bob Marley years after his death, but I'm definitely glad the introduction was made.  He lives on in all our hearts.

B0058A11AK|5.0|Few artists have the interpretive skills that Barbra possesses.  Partnered with the songwriting team of Marilyn and Alan Bergman, it's clear to see why Barbra is in a league of her own as a recording artist.  The Bergmans lyrics are like poetry, and each song receives its own unique treatment by Miss Streisand.  This is a beautiful tribute to friendship and a longtime professional collaboration.  It's Streisand at her best and is one of my favorite releases of the year.

B000059TEQ|2.0|Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw invented the chick flick with this 1970 film adaptation of Erich Segal's syrupy novel of the same name. It's hard to rate LOVE STORY. Everything you can say about it is true: It tugs at the heartstrings, it epitomizes young love, it's emotional and it's moving; it's also maudlin, contrived, mechanical and false. Whether this is a Best Picture nominee or a low-budget pile of tripe really depends entirely on your mood. The cloying sweetness of the brief, poignant relationship between Oliver Barrett IV and Jenny Cavilleri is melded together with pathos---nay, bathos---in a mixture that will bring tears to your eyes, either from sorrow or stunned hilarity. Again, it's all dependent on your mood.<br /><br />Jenny is a Radcliffe girl, yes, but she got to Radcliffe and then Harvard by dint of intelligence and perseverance. Her father owns a bakery in New York. Oliver is a Harvard Legacy boy, whose remoter ancestors came over on the Mayflower and whose more recent ancestors owned the factories that Jenny's forebears probably worked in. They meet and fall deeply, ineradicably in love.<br /><br />Oliver is preternaturally embarrassed by his family's wealth and status. He has distanced himself from his father (whom he calls \\"Sir\\" throughout the film, except for once), played by Ray Milland as Oliver Barrett III. \\"Sir\\" is not a warm father, but he seems more clumsy than venial in attempting to smooth Oliver's way through life. \\"Sir\\" can fix everything with a phone call, and he is dumbfounded by Oliver's refusal to allow him to intercede in getting him into Harvard Law School, getting him a job with the \\"right\\" Firm, funding his lifestyle, and advising him on his marriage. All in all, however, \\"Sir\\" remains distant but gracious toward his son and daughter-in-law. Oliver is surprisingly boorish toward him.<br /><br />Jenny and Oliver's idyll comes to an abrupt end when she is diagnosed with Leukemia, a certain killer in 1970. The constant grayness of the winter scenes effectively foreshadow the death that defines this film.<br /><br />Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are both impossibly young in LOVE STORY. The chemistry between them is palpable and adds to the film's effect (O'Neal once said that he has loved only two women in his life, Farrah Fawcett and Ali MacGraw). MacGraw's scenes with O'Neal sparkle, though her acting is otherwise wooden and her toneless recitation of some of the dialogue is so jarring as to be disturbing. Given the time and place, I had to wonder what, if anything, she was using recreationally.<br /><br />LOVE STORY either descends or ascends into hell or heaven at this point, becoming the tear-jerker nonpareil of all time. As Jenny becomes more ill she becomes even more loving and more beautiful; she's apparently suffering from a cosmetic blood disorder, an overabundance of the Max Factor.<br /><br />LOVE STORY's tag line, \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry,\\" warped a generation of young women for whom the flawed, human flesh-and-blood men they met could not, ever, pass the Oliver Test. The unmeetable romantic expectations of LOVE STORY probably fueled the divorce rate and filled out the ranks of single adults in the Me Decade. Of course, love means being entirely able to say you're sorry when the occasion demands; unless your partner loves you so uncritically that apologies never enter into your relationship, as they don't in this film; but, of course, it is only a film.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|If you are a fan of anything Chris Cornell has done prior to this then \\"scream\\" will shock you.  Almost nothing is left from his days in Soundgarden or Audioslave and this album does a pretty good job of tarnishing his reputation.  The production work on this album is akin to Lady Gaga or Missy Elliot.  He is an artist that I can usually just go and purchase an album from without even hearing it-that is no more.  I recommend that you really give this a listen before even spending a few bucks on it because it is boring and forgettable and it pains me to say that.  Chris Cornell is one of the best but this is a major misstep in an almost flawless career.  Only a Soundgarden reunion will repair his career from this and thankfully that is what is happening.

0545265355|5.0|I disagree with what a lot of people have said on Amazon about the last book to this Trilogy. This was in whole a great Trilogy. The first two books were filled with a lot of action and the third tied in all the emotions left over. It took a little longer to read the third emotionally I think it was more in-depth. I think we need to listen to the whole concept of the book and not take reality TV to the extremes and our enjoyment in it. Also our desensitizing our children at an early age. Everyone should check this out and read all the way to the end.
058201736X|5.0|I wish I would have read this a long time ago. Very enduring and very sad. This is one book I will reread. What an intelligent girl for such a young age.[[ASIN:058201736X Diary of Anne Frank (Longman Imprint Books)
0307593312|4.0|Help me understand, please! I am a big fan of Murakami. Kafka on the Shore is in my Top Five favorite novels.  I eagerly awaited 1Q84, bought it immediately, and have just finished reading it.  And now I need help.  I am underwhelmed by this novel, but I am also worried that I missed something - that I didn't \\"get\\" it.  So (SPOILER ALERT) I am hoping some Amazon readers here will explain things to me.  Here's my problems with the book.  The endless repetition of the same information.  At first this was kinda neat and interesting but 400 - 500 pages in, I was getting tired of hearing about walking door to door with NHK, and I wasn't understanding why this repetition was important.  Second, the minute details. Again, at first, I liked his description of everything - what people wore down to their shoes and the brands of clothing, the interior of apartments - but then I started to wonder what the reason was because it was feeling like the reason was simply to make the book longer.  I am not opposed to the sexual aspect but the sex felt clinical and not erotic and I wondered if something was lost in translation - if the sex scenes were more erotic (more like the Pillow Book) in Japanese, and lost something when written in English.  Finally, as I neared the end of the book, I started to think that the payoff was not going to be worth all 900 pages, and when I got to the end . . . well, it wasn't worth it, at least not to me.  But before you blast me and call me an idiot and reiterate what a god Murakami is, PLEASE know that I want to understand!  I want to know what I missed because that's what I think happened.  Like watching all the seasons of Lost and then not understanding the final episode, I feel that I read all this but missed some essential element.  Insights are greatly appreciated! I want to love this book, but I guess I need help getting there.

B005TTEFRG|5.0|First of all, the first Conan movie was merely an opportunity for Milius and Stone to thrown in a few REH references to make their movie the way they wanted it, which was THEIR philosphy, not Howard's. For his time, Arnie did a pretty good job embodying the Conan character but I always felt he was too musclebound compared to the way Howard described him. I wasn't even too sure about Jason Momoa until I saw the actual trailer for this film and I realized he did his homework in understanding Howard's Conan. After seeing the film I realized he was the perfect match to play the young barbarian in his new adventures in the Hyborian world. I am not referring at all to the comics because they were a genre unto themselves. I am referring to the orginal, Howard's Conan. For any of us who were fans of   REH prior to the comics and films, this was the definitive source material to reference in this movie. Yes, there are weak spots of story line in the film, but generally I felt I was actually watching the exploits of Conan as Howard had imagined him and I believe REH would have been pleased with the results of this movie. No, you are not going to make every Howard fan happy with this film, we are a diverse lot and very impassioned about our hero and his author. But for me, I felt very happy with the result. I hope the sales of this DVD shyrocket enough to warrant a sequel, because I was so depressed to see so few who actually went to see this movie in the theaters. Jason Momoa, you are truly Conan. Thanks for the great job you did in this movie. Marcus Nispell, I have \\"Pathfinder\\" on Blu-Ray DVD and will also get this movie. You did a great job. I hope you get to do more.

0811870987|5.0|Birds. A weird product of evolution that makes for a great coffee table book. I also like that it has a lot a pictures and very little text. This is the best kind of book. Highly recommended to look sweet in your living room and entertain guest that have to awkwardly wait for you while you are getting ready. They will appreciate it more that having to start reading \\"Great Expectations\\" while waiting.

031606792X|1.0|I read the first three books in the Twilight Saga and thought they were good.  I was interested in reading Breaking Dawn so much that instead of waiting for the library to get to my name on the wait list (I was second on the list) I purchased it for $12.  What a waste of money!!  I got Twilight at a yard sale for 50 cents.  LOL  I got New Moon and Eclipse from the library.  Had I known how bad the book was I would have waited my turn at the library.  I found it hard to read it was so bad.  I feel cheated out of so much build up of story lines only to fizzle out to nothing.  I agree with another reviwer.  It was so bad I wanted to rewrite it myself.  Very, very disappointed.  I think it could have been so much better.  Before I read it I purchased advanced tickets for the movie Breaking Dawn.  I can only hope the screenwriter did a decent rewrite of it.  Surely the screenwriter read the book and was aware of how bad it is.  Stephenie what were you thinking?  Please, a do over!
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|This is quite the collaborative project. I got my so-called preview or taste with \\"The View\\" and was hooked in instantly. I've never been terribly keen on Metallica except when I watched their \\"Sweet Jane\\" performance with Lou Reed at the 2009 MSG Rock & Roll 25th Anniversary. Metallica, to their credit, have added muscle + gusto to Lou Reed's vision. I can't think of a better \\"backing band\\" for Lou - his music hasn't sounded this powerful in decades - thanks to Metallica. Frankly, I was expecting \\"Metal Machine Music\\" based upon some of the early erroneous reviews. I can't wait to pop this dynamic 2 CD set back on playback. It's no irony that Lou Reed & Metallica have been riding the wave on this epic release. It's about time that we as well embraced this rare gift. Here's hoping that they tour behind this release and find time to craft a follow-up project.
076781326X|1.0|Something is wrong w/this - it seems as if half the movie is missing, or i only got act 2 because it starts at the scene where Oliver is living in the nice house after escaping.  Is this a lousy copy?  Probably. Ripped off.
0739319175|3.0|Like many of these reviewers, I am astounded at the lack of editing.  I read to get away from the irritations of life.  I read this book and found my self drifting off to those irritations.  This book would not hold my attention!  I would guess a good 100 pages could have been cut out, which would have made this book less irritating.  I like the storyline, his scientific additions, and familiar  cleverness. I hate his unnecessary wordiness.
B002GSXJLG|5.0|Listened to the CD in college. This 2 record vinyl copy is way better. The first freaky sound has much more character than the CD. And the sonic bliss continues all the way to Champagne Supernova. Turning it over sucks, but that is the price to pay for better sound.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I have been using the G155 for about 2 weeks now. The case is sturdy and the screen came in great shape.   I have been alternating between an old style 250gb XBOX 360 and a 120gb PS3 slim.  Both consoles fit well in the G155 and work as intended.  If you choose to buy one, I don't think you will be dissapointed.  It really is a great package for traveling.  Some things I noticed:  The PS3 is a good traveler---no power brick = easy pack up  The XBOX on the other hand---by the time I get the kinect unhooked, ethernet unhooked, then wrap up the cords and the power brick...takes some time.    You might want to think about a dedicated console for this setup.  You really have to pack everything up nice and neat...then plug everything back in when you get to your destination.  Its not like my laptop which I throw in a backpack & off we go.  Overall though, this product definitely does the job.
0446547654|3.0|When I first found out Nicholas Sparks had a new book out, I was quite eager to buy it.  I had read the reviews, some of which were not too flattering. But I thought I'd give it a try. I'm a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and have most of his books. I loved the Notebook.  I found his newest book to be rather choppy instead of smooth flowing.  Just when one character was introduced, another would be brought in.  I found myself often wondering \\"what was the point of this character?\\" He also went into a lot of detail, so much so I found myself skimming over.   In the past his books have often kept me spell-bound, finding myself quite reluctant to put the book down.  Not with this book.  Sparks said this was one of his toughest books to write.  The poor quality shows.  Hopefully his next book will make up for this.

0316098515|2.0|The food at 11 Madison Park is spectacular, wish I could say the same for the cookbook.  It will look beautiful on a coffee table, but without a throng of assistants to help you create the multiple \\"ingredients\\" that are recipes of their own before you can make the dish you actually started out to cook, it's not going to happen.  The authors state all this up front, however purchasing the book online, this key information was not shared.  Other than for inspiration, it's not very useful to actually cook a meal.  Save your money and eat at the restaurant which is fantastic.

0756404738|5.0|So many people have made complaints about how, despite the length of Wise Man's Fear, nothing really happens to extend the overall arching plot lines of the series (such as the chandrian). So. There is some truth to that; you don't find out much more about the chandrian, BUT it's not as if Kvothe's questions and searching for them stops - he's still looking, still finding little scraps, and directing his search more pointedly in his efforts. Most importantly the story doesn't lag despite this, and (I feel at least) that the difficulties in finding out information for the chandrian: a) makes the mystery all the more tantalizing (I can't wait to see how this ends in the final book) b) It's a plot device. When Kvothe can't find out much more about the chandrian he turns to OTHER myths/legends which are CLEARLY big ticket deals and c) highlights the difficulty of finding out about the chandrians deadly secretive ways, because, let's be honest, something THAT BIG can't be easily found. I understand people's desire for a substantive something, but the tantalizing tiny details didn't frustrate me like they did others.  Overall I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. If you bought Name of the Wind I have no doubt that you'll buy Wise Man's Fear, but I felt the need to add my own little opinion to the mix. Buy and enjoy!

B003R50FRI|5.0|This book is truly a masterpiece. It is long and for my liking should have been longer. I read the book for over 2 months whenever I found the time and must admit that it took me to a whole new place fully immersed in the lives of those undertaking this incredible journey. When I eventually finished the book, I was very saddened because the journey ended for me also. I would have loved to continue reading this story with all its plots and highlights for years and years.....But alas....  Thanks for making this book available Gregory and transposing me to the India that you obviously got to know and love so well!!!

1592332803|5.0|This is a great vegan baking cookbook - the recipes are vegan versions of many standard American favorites.  It's a great cookbook to use to show your friends and family how delicious vegan baked goods can be!    Last week I used the pie crust recipe (great pie crust!!) and the apple pie recipe to make apple galettes for a fundraiser bakesale for Harvest Home Animal Sanctuary.  They were a huge hit & were delicious!!    I have really enjoyed the soft pretzel recipe, too!  These are fun to make and sold well at bakesales.  All the recipes I have tried have turned out well.

B001AXOFS4|4.0|I purchased the Deluxe Edition of Adele's album, \\"19\\", after having owned (and ADORED!!) her subsequent album, \\"21\\".    I would characterize \\"19\\" as the younger, more fun-loving sister of \\"21\\". The latter is so much more deep, soulful and moving, that I find myself reverting back to it whenever I want to listen to (and belt out!) some powerhouse, 'you-broke-my-heart-but-I'm-going-to-be-just-fine' kind of ballads. \\"19\\" has a good mix of lighter and more intense tracks which are really great for variety within the same artist & genre.    That being said, both are eloquently written and recorded by Adele with talent and grace beyond her years. I'm also a big fan of ACTUAL instruments being used in the recording process, and you can really appreciate that with both of her records, especially in the live bonus tracks on the Deluxe 2 Disk Edition of \\"19\\".    If you are a fan of UK R&B/Soul with a retro feel (such as Amy Winehouse, Duffy, etc), chances are, you'll LOVE Adele. I recommend both albums.    Enjoy!

B004SBBDB2|1.0|The idea sounded great -- to be able to play things from my iPhone on my television.  This cord has a very generous length, an iPhone/iPod jack on one end and a lot of other jacks on the other end.    It arrived in \\"frustration-free\\" packaging that was not completely frustration free.  I liked that there wasn't that horrid plastic shell you need heavy duty scissors to cut through.  But they should not have put plastic tape around each and every end. That was wasteful and annoying, especially since I had trouble finding the end on several of the pieces of plastic.   The cord does not appear to work.  I don't know if I got a dud, or if there is anything else I should be doing because there were no instructions in the package.  But if I plug the iPhone end of the cord into my iPhone, and the USB connector into my computer, it won't even charge my phone or open iTunes.    I spent 20 minutes trying various configurations on my television to no avail.  The best I got was extremely tinny audio with a bizarre, duplicated, black and white version of the video I was trying to watch.  My TV screen was split in half -- in each half, a black and white image of my video filled about 1/2 of the screen with a very thick black frame around it.  It wasn't even a high quality black and white video -- despite the fact that the video I was playing was hi-def.   It's useless.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|The stock cooler on my Core2 Duo E6850 was struggling to keep my CPU under 70 degrees C under normal multitasking conditions.  This cooler maintains temperatures from 35 degrees C to about 45 degrees C under similar conditions.  The is no noticeable difference in noise levels compared to the stock cooler.  This cooler is huge and required removing the mother board to install the mount on the back side of the mother board.  Fortunately, I had a large case on this computer.  Excellent choice for a relatively inexpensive air cooler as long as your case has the room for it.
0199267189|5.0|This has been described as the best edition of Shakespeare since the First Folio. It appears that the plays developed during the production process, and this edition aims to capture each play as close as possible to the finally staged version. Most editors have included in the text passages that may not have survived the production process, but in this edition these appear separately. The plays are also arranged in probable order of date of composition. I may even re-read them all in this order, to observe Shakespeare's development as a writer and playwright.

B0034G4P80|2.0|I almost bought a copy of this, sight unseen, but instead rented a copy from my library. Thank Odin. If you don't mind the first 30 minutes of a film to be endless CGI/Video game smashing and crashing and bellowing and ...and this is important...to actually SEE IT you better have a high-end high-def TV, otherwise it's so freakin' dark (and I'm trying to watch this on a 46\\" Sony) that you only catch about 40% of what's going on. But that doesn't matter 'cause it's all a big overblown BORE to begin with. Then we get into Natalie Portman looking all cute and serious as some kind of scientist all the fanboys will drool over. (remember Jennifer Connelly and Liv Tyler in the Hulk films? You get the picture) Anyway, I never cared much for the comic book character to begin with and I was hoping that the movie would improve on the blonde-haired beachboy from Asgard. It didn't. Bottom line...rent it before buying it. You may save some money for something better, like the X-Men First Class movie.

B004A8ZX28|5.0|Hollywood can still make good movies, and this is an example of a very  good one. It kept my wife and I rooted to the screen all the way  through. It is interesting, suspenseful, and entertaining with enough  good, believable action to keep you on the edge of your seat.  One thing that makes it a movie to be seen is that it isn't completely  ludicrous like so many movies today that are full of plots that seem to  come from a ten year old.  It's true that you have to stretch a little but not to much so that you  can imagine something like this possibly happening. In other words,  it's all possible. There isn't anything that actually couldn't be done  in real life.  It's a good movie.

B005AUWXZ0|4.0|Honestly other than a more complicated story line than the original movie, This movie is extremely enjoyable. My 3 year old had questions about why the race cars were \\"broken\\" and about why there were \\"lemons\\". Mater's character supplies more than enough laughs throughout the movie while co-star Finn McMissle supplies a lot of the action. The story line did seem a little hard to follow at times and would drift off story to gain a few cheap laughs. That's one of the main reasons I rated it 4 stars but I would never rate it any lower. As far as cartoon violence, I'm guessing you don't like your kids watch Wil-e-coyote or Tom & Jerry cartoons either? If you're not comfortable watching this cartoon with your kids, I recommend not watching classics like Bambi or the Lion King with your kids either. It almost sounds like some people that watched this would rather have Finn McBubbles be the spy car. If you are not into the whole spy movie plot, that is one thing, but trashing it because of cartoon violence or because it is not entertaining as the original is B.S.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|SARAH'S KEY is one of the best movies I've seen thus far this year.<br /><br />It is a brutally realistic Holocaust film, but it is also an engrossing mystery that follows two parallel storylines.<br /><br />Kristin Scott Thomas stars as an American Journalist, living in Paris with her French husband and teenage daughter.  She is currently researching a story about the French Government's role in rounding up Jews during World War II and sending them to Nazi death camps.  In talking to one of her in-laws, Kristin learns that a relocated Jewish family once occupied the apartment in which her father-in-law was raised, and which she and her family are now about to move into.  Disturbed by this information, Kristin is determined to discover what happened to that family.<br /><br />Kristin's story cuts back-and-forth with the saga of Sarah (Melusine Mayance), the young French Jewish girl who, back in 1942 when the French police came, locked her younger brother in a closet so that he would not be taken away.  This part of the heart-wrenching narrative follows her heroic efforts to escape the death journey to Poland, return to Paris and free her brother.<br /><br />As moving and as well done as this film may be, like all Holocaust movies, SARAH'S KEY is not always easy to watch.  The performances are superb, as are the storytelling abilities of Gilles Paquet-Brenner, who directed this adaptation of Tatiana de Rosnay's bestselling novel.<br /><br />The supporting cast of the movie, presented in both English and French (with English subtitles), includes Niels Arestrup, Frederic Pierrot and Aidan Quinn.<br /><br />The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a \\"Making of\\" featurette.<br /><br />© Michael B.

1451648537|5.0|Don't let the detractors keep you from reading this amazingly captivating book. I have read every book written about Steve Jobs, and this one by far is the most complete account of his life.  Whereas other books on the market approach Jobs from a business perspective, this book provides an insight into the real man behind the legend, warts and all.  I'm reading this one slowly so it won't end too quickly. It's that good!
0385535139|2.0|Borrow this book from the library or from a friend.   It's mildly entertaining, but not worth spending your money on if you are expecting a \\"real\\" John Grisham book. It's painfully boring at times. I'm half way through, and tempted every few pages just to put it away. Having spent my own money buying it on Audible, I'll slog on, even though I could not care less about any of the characters or how it will end.

0525423656|5.0|Fans of Matched will not be disappointed - and I am a fan. Cassia is a strong character, one the reader will feel connected to and sympathetic to, especially in her quest to find Ky. Since Ky narrates about half of the book, his history and fears are revealed. Once again, Condie does a beautiful job describing the scenes allowing the reader to visualize the locations, especially the Outer Provinces. There is a simplicity and poetic beauty to the narration allowing the reader to be a part of the characters' journeys. Several new characters are introduced-- Vick, Eli, and Indie are particularly strong. Didn't see much of Xander, but I have a feeling he'll play a much larger role in book 3 - and perhaps, just maybe, he might be Cassia's true MATCH? Can't wait to find out!
B005IZLPMY|3.0|For the record, my husband would give this movie 4 stars.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on 3 just because (like many other reviewers) I wasn't crazy about the ending.  However, I enjoyed the movie and I am not at all sorry I bought it.  For the record, I am not a comic book fan and I did not really know the backstory to the Captain America story - and I had no trouble following the plot, as some others said they did.  The acting wasn't exactly A+, but I didn't think it was THAT bad.  I enjoyed the story, and I in particular liked the villain.  In reality, it was a gift for my husband and he loved it, so I was satisfied with that.  I myself also enjoyed it; I am sure I will watch it again.  As I said, I was not crazy about the ending; I take it that they were trying to set up a follow up movie, but it felt a bit awkward and disjointed from the rest of the film.  I feel they either should have gone a bit farther with it or left it out entirely.  I recommend.

B005NPLXJ4|2.0|OK, so Metallica had some fun with Lou Reed during the Rock n Roll HOF, but don't torture the rest of us with his style of writing and singing.  The only reason to give these album two stars is because Metallica's music kept me from cutting my wrists while listening to it.  On a serious note, this ranks down there with ST. Anger as being the worst Metallica album, Please get back on track (like you were with Death Magnetic) on the next release... and Lou \\"crawl back to the crypt, PLEASE\\"

0525423656|3.0|I found this sequel to \\"Matched\\" to be something of a disappointment. The switching between points of view was somewhat confusing and caused the flow of the storyling to become disjointed and jerky. I don't have a problem with an author changing points of view, but the switches in first person viewpoints was hard to follow at times and resulted in a stilted plot flow. New characters were also not well developed and seemed one dimensional.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I loved this movie when I was nine, and I still love it at the age of 25! The animation is incredible, such a good use of color, and effects! The story is incredible, I think it's the most mature story Disney has ever done. I love the characters in this movie, very funny, and compelling. The music is amazing, Hans Zimmer, and Elton John, doesn't get any better then this! And the voice acting is top notch,and so are the songs! I recently got the Blu-ray release of this movie, and I have to say, I was not disappointed if anything I am wowed by the clarity in the picture, and the sound!, The menu's are beautifully done! This is a must buy to any Disney fan, and especially for family's, a true masterpiece!

B000002GC2|5.0|I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who would look back on this album who'd feel something of a guilt complex for liking an album whose musical virtues lay so heavily in it's production. Sad to say even....a member of my family who I won't name out of respect didn't find this album particularly to their liking for a long time. Perhaps one of the reasons why this album has such a different reputation is that it represents a somewhat different Quincy Jones than the one who recorded [[ASIN:B000002GC4 Sounds & Stuff Like That]] several years earlier. That was a recording that owed a great deal of it's musical energy to funk and R&B. This on the other hand showcased a lot more sleek urban contemporary pop considerations and in the end sounds perhaps like a slightly more commercial record that Quincy had done up to this point. This was released around the time of Mike's [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]],Johnson's [[ASIN:B000002GF0 Light Up the Night]] and Patti Austin's [[ASIN:B003UI50CM Every Home Should Have One]]. If your already fully familiar with those three albums, than it may not be too necessary for you to read this review since you already sort of know the sound of it. For those who aren't,here's what this is.<br /><br />  One of the singer/songwriter/instrumentalists who caught Quincy's ear around this time was Englands Chas Jankel from Ian Dury's Blockheads. His debut [[ASIN:B000A7BBHY Chas Jankel]] contained a song called \\"Ai No Corrida\\" that is presented here and,while not as musically abstract it is more \\"Quincified\\" along with the lead vocals of Charles May who takes  the very British vocal affectations of Chas away from this version. The title song is the most thoroughly funk oriented number here with a stomping beat,bassline and keyboard solo with Q himself rapping as \\"the dude\\" along with an artist Quincy was at the time just in the process of developing-James Ingram. The multi talented singer/musician/songwriter is featured on the slower ballads here such as \\"Just Once\\" and \\"One Hundred Ways\\",which without surprise became the biggest hits. But they're actually far from the best songs. Those were sung by Patti Austin. \\"Betcha Wouldn't Hurt Me\\" and the compulsive \\"Razzanatazz\\" are both key uptempo songs here with a vibrant sophistifunk sound to them. \\"Somethin' Special\\" is a similar but slower sort of song,maybe even a little more jazzy and another highlight with a rather adult romance audience in mind. \\"Velas\\" is a similarly themed instrumental featuring one of Q's old hands Toots Theilmans on harmonica and whistling. There were stories I heard that the closing dance funk of \\"Turn On The Action\\" was originally intended for Michael Jackson. And honestly it does rather sound like him.<br /><br />  Believe it or not,a persons appreciation of this album will probably have to stem from whether they really take the urban contemporary jazz-sophistifunk sound of the early 80's very seriously. Coming during the first years of the post disco era,where music of a certain rhythmic and racial signitures couldn't be played on a lot of radio stations this along with similarly style albums during this time by people like Grover Washington Jr,Al Jarreau and Michael Franks also receive a similar treatment as being at best \\"a guilty pleasure\\" and as worst \\"a sell out\\". Honestly I have absolutely no guilty feelings whatsoever in the level of enjoyment I have for this album. If your a fan of edgy,angst ridden albums filled with a \\"keeping it real\\" attitude with some variant of hip-hop or neo soul rhythmic pattern to it...no I'd have to agree this album probably isn't going to be your cup of tea. Whenever you have the level of production,musicianship and songwriting/vocal power you have with something like this it's from a time and a place where the musical approach was very different. And above all being done by a whole other generation as well. No putting down anyone. But there's just a different spirit behind this than muchof...well even what Quincy himself is currently doing musically. And happily many people in the music world are still paying careful attention to works such as this.t Quincy himself is currently doing musically.

0385534639|5.0|This book is exactly what one hopes for in a good story and rarely finds. The story is beautifully written. The book flows and unfolds in a sensual literary delight. Allow yourself to be caught up in the magic as the story develops. The title, The Night Circus tells you what the story is about. It is a circus like none you have ever attended. As you get caught up in the story you find yourself wishing such a place existed. You know if it did you would do everything in your power to visit it. The circus itself would make this a special read. You then have the added pleasure of many well developed, likable characters and the amazing story of how the circus itself comes into being. It's the kind of book you don't want to put down. Then you realize the story is closer to being over with every page read and you begin to slow down. You don't want to leave The Night Circus and maybe you don't have to.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were amazing! I never wanted to put them down! There is never a dull moment in any of these books, I could not wait to get the next book. When I finished the last book I was heartbroken. The books were so amazing and I was ecstatic with the ending, but I could not believe it was the last book. :( I will never find a series with so much passion, love, and war that was as great as this one. I am going to read it over and over and over again!! I LOVE THESE BOOKS!!!
0525423656|5.0|I really loved this book.  I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy Crossed as much as Matched but I think it was better.  Now I can spend the next year worried that the conclusion will be disappointing.  Please Ally, continue to wow me!

B005O30Y5Y|1.0|I just cancelled my pre-order because of this.  I thought we had antitrust laws in the USA.  If this isn't collusion and anti-competitive behavior I don't know what is.  The whole point is by not allowing you to play their content on Apple products they are preventing Apple from competing. Plus, saying there is a \\"digital copy\\" when there isn't is false advertising.  Sickening!
0525423656|1.0|There wasn't much action at all like there was in the first book matched.  The plot in Matched kept you guessing and interested.  This book Crossed was boring and uneventful.  It wasn't much of an adventure.

B0000071GA|5.0|I absolutely agree with earlier reviews: This was Krokus' best album recorded at their peak, N 1 of the best heavy metal albums in all of the 80's! I saw them open for KISS at The U.N.O. Lakefront arena January '85 N they were AMAZING!! After playing most of their set, they walked off for a minute, N fake heads of each band member were set up on stage stuck on head hunter poles, N they were gonna do a set from this album. Unfortunately, most of the crowd didn't agree, though I can't understand why, N something happened that forced them to end the show without the encore. After that album N tour, they began sinking into obscurity, N I always thought that was lousy!! If you like good, rocking, classic metal, get this! You won't regret it!! Also, @ Andrew Etherington \\"The Guru\\" I thought you would like to know (cuz I would) that they'd done 6 albums before Headhunter: Krokus (1976) To You All (1977) Painkiller/Pay It In metal (1978) Metal Rendez-Voucher (1979) Hardware (1981) & One Vice At A Time (1982) I hope you're able to get the 3 you're missing...
0553582038|2.0|I don't know that there is much to say that hasn't already been said in other reviews.  While reading the first 3 books, I hated putting them down.  When I did, I felt anxious to pick them back up feeling like I had \\"left something behind\\".  I read the first 3 in less then a month.  I have now been reading this book for over a month and it feels like a chore to pick it up and read it.  I don't understand how  such a wonderful series of books could take such a nosedive.  I am debating on whether I even want to read the 5th.  What a letdown!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|If you are not familiar with, or a fan of, the classic novel by Charlotte Bronte, you may not \\"get\\" the significance of the story, especially with Cary Fukinangas extremely stark retelling; he uses silence and visuals more than dialouge. I first read the book when I was 10 years old; then, a man like Rochester seemed a romantic ideal. Of course, a few decades later, and some experience with the male of the species under my belt, I have a different take on the whole scenario ;)<br /><br />For a young man, director Cary Fukinaga captures the true character of Rochester. Or perhaps precisely because he is male, he nailed the exact nature of the beast when he read the book; women tend to want to see the best in men they are attracted to, make excuses, and think the power of their kiss can turn a frog into a prince. This film makes very little excuse for Rochester. One must remember, although the Bronte sisters are the famous ones, they grew up very close to their only brother, a young man who drank, gambled and womanized to excess, and was undoubtedly mentally ill. In the parlance of the times, he became \\"disipated\\", eventually dying young in a \\"fit of madness\\", leaving his family with a lot of guilt and unanswered questions about what went wrong. I think in some fashion, Charlotte, who herself had very little experience with men outside her dysfunctional family, tried to save and redeem this brother in her romantic portrayal of Rochester. This film strips off the romance, and leaves nothing but stark reality.<br /><br />Mia Waskowski made an excellent Jane, her nonverbal communication is excellent, but a little more dialouge would have been nice; if you have not read the book, you may wonder what makes Jane so special, and why she is crazy for Rochester in the first place. In the book, the intellectual banter between the two sealed the deal, but here, you are left wondering, other than the fact that Jane has very few options in regards to \\"dating\\", why she would fall so hard for a selfish, secretive, cynical man like Rochester. I also must commend Judy Densch on her portrayal of Mrs. Fairfax; protective of Jane, with a wisdom she really can't express. She's a woman who has had to make the best of her \\"place\\" in life.<br /><br />Cary Fukanaga also properly captured the occult and metaphysical overtones of the book; the \\"demon in the attic\\", as metaphor for what haunts Rochester. Married off for money, Rochester's wife turned out to be a mentally ill woman of low moral character (oddly, just like Charlotte Bronte's real life brother) But, rather than sending her away to a mental institution, he secretly locks her away in the attic of his house. The scene in the attic was quite telling; Rochester tenderly embraces the \\"succubus\\", exclaiming, \\"my old demon\\", and allows her to triumphantly spit on the virginal Jane. In another scene, Rochester takes hold of Jane, proclaiming he wants what she has locked safely inside herself; her Soul. Why? Because Jane's unsullied Soul would \\"regenerate him with a vengence\\". Is Rochester really capable of Love? Or has he himself become a sort of \\"incubus\\", a \\"demon\\" in search of a Soul? Jane was quite right to run away as fast as she could! Too bad she went back; IMHO, she should have kept all of her inheritance, and kept running!, secretive, cynical man like Rochester.

B005H1SDQU|5.0|I just received this album and am overjoyed. Hackett's classical influences are brought to a bright and meaningful modern light. As expected, the guitar work is impeccable, as is his vocal clarity and shine. Chris Squire's bass gives a reminder of Yes at their best. Numerous classical instruments such as cello, flutes, sax ond other instruments help give a timeless air. There are also Egyptian influences which help provide a rich variety to the double disc. The brief liner notes add to the pleasure and help place the pieces in a geographical context. Play this one LOUD as the mastering encourages the complete absorption of the listener into Hackett's dreams, visions and observations without losing sound quality (head phones are probably a good idea).

B001LXIDVS|5.0|Back to the Future Part III(1990) picks up where the second film left off and completes the story arc. Marty McFly is stuck in 1955 after the DeLorean is struck by lightning. Marty and a younger version of Doc Brown restore the DeLorean after they find it in a cave. When Marty finds out that Doc Brown was killed in 1885, Marty travels to that time period to take Doc home. In 1885, Doc Brown falls in love with a lovely, educated schoolteacher, Clara Clayton(Mary Steenburgen). Marty, Doc Brown, and Clara are bullied by Buford \\"Mad Dog\\" Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson). Marty has to stop Buford Tannen from killing Doc and they have to return to 1985. Back to the Future Part III cuts back on technology and puts more of its focus on plot and character. There's an homage to Once Upon a Time in the West(1968) as the camera films Hill Valley, California in the year 1885. Back to the Future Part III was filmed in Jamestown, CA and I saw it on a field trip in grade school. The town was destroyed by fire. Alan Silvestri is back and he adds a \\"Western\\" flavor to the music score. A scene where Buford Tannen kills Marshall Strickland(James Tolkan) in cold blood was deleted from the film. ZZ Top makes a cameo in the film and they perform the theme song. Sexy Mary Steenburgen is quite good as Clara. She also played Clara Clayton on the Back to the Future animated series. Back to the Future Parts II and III were filmed back to back in 1989. Movies such as Missing in Action I and II and The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions used the same gimmick. Back to the Future Part III was a solid, final film in a fun movie franchise.

030788743X|5.0|I was born in 1981. I am a child of the 80's. And thus my opinion is more than a little skewed when it comes to this book. That said, Ready Player One is TOTALLY AWESOME. If you enjoy cyber-punk, classic video games, classic rock, pop-culture, MMORPG's, sci-fi, pop-culture, and ESPECIALLY the 80's as it relates to all of the above, you will absolutely LOVE this book.<br /><br />I've read and watched my small share of cyberpunk in my time, from Ghost in the Shell to Zegapain, from the Matrix to Neuromancer and Johnny Mnemonic. And I gotta say the online world of Oasis is probably the most fully-imagined online environment ever to be pulled out of thin air.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one, based on classic movies from the 80's like War Games and The Last Starfighter. An ordinary kid from the slums has a chance at saving the world with a little help from his best friend and girl-next-door-type love interest (and of course an aging wizard/guide/mysterious old man). There are evil corporate fiends out to kill him, and countless dangers in the online world (from monsters to gangs of interstellar pirates out to jack your Avatar's starship). But the prize is more money than Bill Gates and the salvation of the Online Free World. And thus the stage is set for a radical adventure 80's style!<br /><br />The writing style is fun, fluid, and easy to read. The world described is easy to imagine and just plain cool (imagine a combination of World of Warcraft, Old Republic, OZ from the anime Summer Wars, and every 80's reference you can imagine). And the dialog, though of course riddled with the usual trash-talk and expletives, still manages to have more wit and charm and just plain enjoyable passages than any sci-fi I've read since Robert Heinlein and Orson Scott Card.<br /><br />I've heard it said that people are tired of hearing the same stories over and over and want something new. Personally I imagine most people are like me and long for the same old stories told in new and interesting ways. That's what this book is. It's a classic sci-fi tribute to the 80's in a cyberpunk world with some extremely entertaining moments (including a massive showdown between giant robots and some fun plot twists that will bring a huge smile to your face).<br /><br />If you love the 80's or any of the things I described you must read this book. If you enjoy sci-fi or cyberpunk at all you owe it to yourself to give it a try. For a first book by an author it's absolutely amazing.book is.

B003WJRW2U|3.0|This is a rapidly evolving field, I got the book, breezed through it, and found out it was dated. The stuff that's there is mostly accurate, but some new stuff is left out. Find a newer book is my advice (or don't buy a book at all until the HTML 5 spec is solidified a bit more).
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Overall good film for any Harry Potter Fan! Best story, yet for this medium. The grown up actors (Radcliffe,Watson,Grint) give their best performance yet! Yates (director) also deserves some credit as he brings the story and the characters to life in relatable, realistic way!

B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust deftly combines adventure, romance, comedy, and fantasy into a wonderful little movie.  Its pace is brisk, its comedic timing spot-on, and its dramatic moments truly gripping.  The cast is great, especially the lead work by Clare Danes as well as the supporting turns by Sienna Miller, Robert DeNiro, and the always-excellent Mark Strong.<br /><br />I don't think any movie will ever quite recapture the magic of The Princess Bride, but this fun, stylish movie comes quite close.<br /><br />Five stars!

B001NFNFNU|5.0|I love watching true story movies. This movie will keep you locked in from the beginning till the end. I know a lot of story's made into movies aren't 100% true. But it is great to watch and then look up on line for the truth. If you are like me you should Google \\"Wineville Chicken-Coop Murders\\". Great info about what really happened. Like Gordon wasn't killing kids alone. His mother was killing kids with him. At the end of the movie a boy goes home who was kidnapped by Gordon. That really happened, five years after Gordon was hung. In the movie the boy said him, Walter Colins, and two brothers got away. What really happened is he saw Walter and the two brothers be murdered by Gordon. Christine Colins did have hope for her sons return years later, but not because what the boy said like in the movie. But because Gordon kepted saying he didn't kill Walter when she went to visit him before his hanging. Police bringing Christine a boy who wasn't Walter and putting her away because she wouldn't excepeted him really happened.<br /><br />It is real sad what happen to Walter and how the police treated Christine. I am happy she kept fighting for her son and fighting the police for the way they treated her. I hope she was able to move on with her life and not let the lost of Walter depress her. Which I could see how it could.

B005I64U5C|4.0|This reviewer was somewhat disappointed with the initial big screen premier of GREEN LANTERN back in June 2011. Collecting and following the DC Comic Book Superhero character for years with all its rich history was maybe part of the reason for a negative reaction to the film because expectations were so high. When the release of the Blu-Ray/DVD for GREEN LANTERN in October was approaching, this reviewer was not going to even purchase it because of the initial screening. However, this reviewer relented and even bought the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Package because of the extended director's cut. Well, seeing the film again, this reviewer found the movie entertaining and not as bad as was remembered from the June big screen premier. Perhaps the film works better on the small screen than on the big screen (and without the annoying 3-D glasses and without a bunch of noisy teenagers in the theater yelling at the screen). This reviewer found a few positive points for the film. Ryan Reynolds does a decent job as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern as does the rest of the cast. The movie worked well when the film shifted to the Green Lantern Corps home planet on OA. However, the scenes on Earth are somewhat clunky. The creators had a chance to make a great space opra film with the Green Lantern Corps being a sort of Jedi Knights equivalent (The Green Lantern Corps were created years before Jedi Knights), but maybe the sequel (hopefully) will address that. Overall,a decent add-on to the superhero film genre that works better on the small screen.
0545265355|5.0|You won't be disappointed with these books, and the hardcovers only add to the quality. I highly recommend you pick these up, especially for the great price.
0756405890|2.0|I had the audio version, so keep this in mind, even though the reader did a fine job. The book itself suffered from poor character development, and general 'overwroughtness'. It was just too contrived, predictable and unsophisticated. I think having read George RR Martin recently may have ruined me. But then again....where were the editors? they should have cut this book in half at least. If I were 14 years old, I probably would have enjoyed this more. Unfortunately, I'm 46. I won't be wasting time on the next installment.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I used this to hook a pair of nice computer speakers up to my TV's optical out. Worked perfectly right from the start, no audible problems with quality.  The cable on the included power adapter is rather short, but since it's powered by a standard mini-USB connector finding extensions or replacements for that is trivial.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I am not usually one for fantasy films about psychics and the afterlife, but this one has such depth  that I could suspend my disbelief and feel completely engrossed in the emotions of the characters.  I have never seen acting so fine and vivid in this genre.  It is moving, beautiful, mysterious, and psychologically real.  I think it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film starts with the 2004 tsunami that devastated Indonesia.  A French woman is swept up in the wave, receiving a terrible blow in the head that brings her near death while submerged.  What she sees changes her life, alienating her from her past and its certainties.  She loses everything.  Meanwhile, we learn about a young man from San Francisco, a psychic who is searching desperately for a way to live and love with his \\"ability\\".  Every time he sees a potential relationship, it seems, his ability destroys his chances.  He is not helped by his brother, who is pushing to exploit his ability as a business concern.  The third character is a boy, whose mother is a junkie and who loses someone near to him.  He is pitifully depressed and seeking answers while in fostercare.<br /><br />How their lives intersect is the plot of the story.  However, the theme - of being able to move on with one's life - is wonderfully evoked by Eastwood, who is one of the greatest filmmakers alive.  Every gesture and expression of the 3 characters moved me, their struggle and melancholy totally believable, at least to me, as they search for resolution and a way forward.  It brought tears to my eyes, perhaps because I lost my father not too long ago.  The film actually helped me to mourn.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  I know it isn't for everyone, but it sure worked for me.
0061353248|5.0|For me, this book was terribly fascinating. Dan Ariely does such an excellent job explicating all the ways that our thinking falls apart at the economic level. He exposes all the weaknesses of our psychology. There is a silver lining, however, in that being aware of these weaknesses will help us because the conditions that bring them about are predictable. Hence, \\"predictably irrational.\\"  Ariely's writing style is lucid and frequently humorous. He's probably one of the few authors I have read that have told me in such detail why I'm stupid and make me laugh about that fact. There's so many lessons in here on how to avoid the failings that I'm going to have a hard time keeping track of them all. Nonetheless, I feel that by merely reading this I'm walking away a bit wiser in my spending habits and the marketing that I encounter on a daily basis.  I would be interested in knowing if there's anybody out there trying to counter Ariely's work. I know that he is a behavioral economist which somewhat seeks to undermine classic economics (particularly the assumption that we make rational, economic decisions). If anybody knows of a work contra Ariely, I would be interested in hearing about it. Likewise, if anybody knows of any other books that are along these lines (except for The Upside of Irrationality, which I have pending in my to-read pile), I would like to hear about those as well.  The book has been of practical use to me as well. I have found myself in predicaments similar to those that Ariely discusses and, recognizing them, switched to a more \\"aware\\" contemplation of what was going on. So it's true (for me, at least) that being aware of our own faults will help us catch ourselves from falling into them.

B001HN6922|4.0|Update:  We've watched this 5 times this first week--one being with the commentary.  Our 10 year old has requested that he have our first ever Disney Cars birthday party.   The mixed reviews almost kept me from purchasing Cars 2.  I do not review products very often, but I couldn't resist trying to help future purchasers make it through the jungle of opinions!  Here are my comments/kids' reactions (10, 8, 5, 2) to various compliments/complaints mentioned.  1.  Theme:  We like family movies with positive themes. Because of the reviews that said it was a waste of time-  or that there wasn't even a theme-I hesitated to buy Cars 2. I was pleasantly surprised! Who could miss the themes?  Many more positive lessons learned than in Cars 1.  Even our children picked up on the pervasive positive friendship theme (accepting your friends, competitors being friends, being a faithful friend) as well the self acceptance theme. Loved how Tow Mater, once he accepted himself, challenged others to choose happiness over jealousy . Appreciated the spy cars realizing Tow Mater's value underneath all of his rust.    2.  Plot:  Yes, a bit more sophisticated than Cars 1.  Perhaps this is why my husband and I didn't mind watching it on a Sunday afternoon, and then again on the same evening.  Our 10 year old enjoyed the mystery/suspense.  We didn't mind that it was a more intricate story line than Cars 1.  We probably prefer it.  It is full of action.  Perhaps our 5 year old didn't keep up with the plot/humor, but there were plenty of other reasons for her to stay interested.   3.  Setting:  Great fun to travel and experience other cultures with McQueen and Tow Mater.  3.  Audience:  Because of the plot, yes, I'd say it is aimed for a slightly older audience...but even our 2 year old enjoyed the boats and the water.  4.  Music:  Cars 1 music was overbearing for us.  I'd say Cars 2 was about as equally annoying with the music--about the same number of times we turned it down.  5.  Potty Humor:  I'm still thinking on this one.  Okay, I've thought...probably a bit much.  6.  Gambling/Alcohol:  Indeed, so unnecessary.  Of everything, this probably bothered us the most...having our heroes partake of these.  To have the diner in Radiator Springs now be a bar...discouraging.  7.  Sexual Innuendos: We forwarded through more of these in Cars 1.  What few there are in Cars 2 (1?) were mild in comparison.  8.  Violence:  Yes, lots of guns, shooting, spy chasing--but just resulting in crashing.  Our kids understood cars can be restored :) I will say our 10 year old was a bit disheartened at the torture scene--definitely could have left out the word \\"kill\\" here. Maybe before watching the first time, you might want your kids prepared some way.    9. Characters:  Our children enjoyed meeting new characters.  There were enough of the old \\"friends\\" included for them.    10. Political Innuendos:  Both kinds of fuel were presented positively and negatively.  No sinister motives here.  It was just a conflict to use for the plot.  11. Humor:  I can't count how many times we watched different parts to enjoy the laugh-out-loud humor.  Delightful!  Who can stop laughing at the monster truck?  And the voice activation humor?  12. Animation:  The international scenery and the spy chases were intriguing. This was perhaps my favorite part of seeing the movie--catching all the details.    13.  Worth the buy?  We enjoyed this ride even more so than Cars 1.  Perhaps it is a love/hate decision due to the touch of intense violence/gambling/drinking situations, but we felt we had to forward through as many or more details in Cars 1.  Otherwise, we laughed and wowed more in Cars 2.   I hope that any future Cars movies will be cleaned up a bit.  The need to forward through so many little parts keeps me from giving it 5 stars.    Don't miss the ride in case you might enjoy it!
B005J4TLQG|3.0|I thought this would possibly be another shaun of the dead movie. This one did get started quicker but many of the laughs are missing. Instead this film seems to be slightly aimed at the 13-18 year old group as the main protagonist are in that age range as well. There were a couple laughs here and there but nothing that will have you rolling on the floor. The scare factor is pretty small as well, although there were plenty of monsters they just never seemed to get \\"in your face\\" I would compare this movie to Tremors in its level of scariness. As in not very.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I was lucky & got Woverine for a good price from someone else.  It was a FANTASTIC, STUNNING & AN AWESOME movie.  If you can't tell, I liked it.<br /><br />You see his infancy.  they don't tell you what happened at this birth, if his claws came later or any of that type of information.  But from the very beginning it is a movie that grabs your attention & hold on to it to the end.  Marvel is coming out with a lot of superheros & gods beginnings.  so I'm pretty sure that they are planning for a spectacular epic for us using all the characters that inhabit the Marvel Universe.  Because this movie here isn't just about Wolverine's origins but also of Sabertooth.  You also see a lot of the other characters that inhabit Marvelverse.<br /><br />If you are a Wolverine fan, you will need this film.  If you like action movies, you will need this movie.  If you like Marvel movies so far, get this one because I'm pretty sure you're going to need it.<br /><br />I am pretty sure that Ladies will like this one, even if it isn't a (sorry) chick-flick.  But you will like it.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Great film, crazy premise. Check out the twist in this film!! Lots of action cool fight scenes, make this memorable and the ending makes it unforgettable. Just remember this film is not for the feint of heart... or stomach.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Once again the cast of the Big Bang Theory brings us a great show with some tear inducing funny scenes.
B004SBBDB2|5.0|I got this AV cable set to have it installed permanently in the bedroom.  About a year back I had bought an expensive $40+ Apple brand set (that is used in my living room) and this one works the same at about half the price!  It has a USB charger too, which is a MUST if you are going to use it to watch movies.  I use it primarily for rented movies from Itunes or netflix and even HBO GO. The component cable hooks up easily and it even works with my old TV in the bedroom, so it isn't just for the new TVs.  You just have to have component hook ups.  Make sure you have your Iphone set up to play on the TV in settings for it to work properly!  I recommend this as a lower cost alternative to the Apple brand AV Cable.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|the whole transaction was good. The time and quality of the sale was smooth and satisfactory. I am very satisfied all around.
0749942169|5.0|I virtually never read mysteries, except P.D.James and all of the late Batya Gur. But I will read Rosamond Lupton as soon as a book comes out. I bought this, do not remember why, from Amazon.uk because apparently her work is more available or more popular in England than in USA. Here's my take on her magical skills:<br /><br />You open a novel, whether \\"Sister\\" which was purely perfect or \\"Afterwards\\", which has flaws I'll get to, and you are moving as fast as you can because she makes you instantly hooked, instantly fascinated. There is some magic in that feat. No matter your mood or time of day or night (I opened this, mistake,to take a look on last Saturday morning and it was 6 PM when I finished losing a day in which I had much to do.)<br /><br />I cannot yet analyze how Ms.Lupton pulls this off. Usually I can read as a writer but apparently her way with a story just makes me fully immersed without observing what she does that is so compelling.<br /><br />Even with the flaws here--too many characters, too convoluted as to who did what and when, as to even the villians, IT DID NOT MATTER to me. Anyone who writes in a way that I literally panic if I put the book down for five minutes and then panic when I'm not sure where I left it, has my 5 star vote. I don't know why the author got overly convoluted. Maybe she gets bored if she is not creating massive suspense, but I recommend this not despite its flaws, but because the flaws don't really matter. I know this does not make logical sense but it makes fictional sense. She is just great. Thanks Rosamund for another great read. Keep em coming!!!
B00192IV0O|5.0|Bought this album for one song that I really loved, but got a whole album of songs I already knew and liked, and then some new songs, that I love and just can't get enough of.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This first album by Bruno Mars is just great, his stunning ballads are beautiful, but the album also has some upbeat songs which just makes the album one of the best I have bought for a long time.
B0034G4OZO|4.0|This little movie didn't hang around the theaters long, so unfortunately I missed it until now.  Certainly not the first movie to focus on mentally disturbed hospital patients, and the very fact the setting is the psych ward at a mainstream hospital suggests that none are here are for the long term.  As Zach Galifianakis' character Bobby says, \\"He's there for kind of a vacation\\".  Craig (Keir Gilchrist), a 16 year old in suicidal depression checks himself in (no parent needed I guess) and falls prey to the affable Bobby and hottie Noelle (Emma Roberts).  It would have been easy to make this all comedy, especially with Galifianakis in the film.  Another obvious option would be to make a high stakes drama.  Instead, the film is neither.  It is just a day or two in the life of a psych ward.  The humor is there but not the in-your-face kind.  The drama?  Likewise.  Galifianakis proves he can do more than physical comedy, with a subtle take on a man with plenty of issues, but mostly held in check.  I liked his performance and I liked the movie.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|There are not words strong enough to describe how much this book has helped me by enlightening me to issues involved with Alzheimer's.  The disease is so, so much more than just forgetting.  As I read the story of Alice's journey, I could pinpoint exactly when I saw the same issues in my own relative.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone caring for Alzheimer's patients, whether in the family or in the health care profession.  Honestly, it is a book that everyone should read.  THIS BOOK SHOULD BE ALLOWED 10 STARS!! HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Having seen this movie several times over the years, I tend to watch at it without the dread of being shocked by the shower scene.  Looking at this lustrous Blu-ray version, I noticed that when Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) drags out the body of recently slashed Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) you can see faint panty lines. Ah, the modesty of the 60's.  Hitchcock raised the bar very high with this superior horror film and proved that the genre didn't always have to be full of blood and schlock.  What was shocking in this masterpiece is that it was so startling, compounded by the music with emphasis on heavy violin work.  It was also unheard of that the \\"A\\" list star would be butchered so early in the film.  Frankly, the second murder of the private detective (Martin Balsam) is equally shocking but then he's not a naked Janet Leigh.  Perkins is brilliant as the shy Norman with a dark secret.  The byplay between him and Marion in the parlor prior to the murder is a terrific set up.  Also watch him when Sam (John Gavin) puts pressure on him later in the film.  Perhaps more than any other film, \\"Psycho\\" turned the film industry on its head and made horror films mainstream.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Thought-provoking topic. Interesting movie about the real life struggles of someone with autism. Claire Danes is a phenomenal actress in this movie.  Pulls at your heart strings without being too depressing. Great Film.
B004XQO90E|4.0|Director Duncan Jones gets a little more money to work with after the success of \\"Moon\\" a couple years ago.  In this modern day sci-fi thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a helicopter pilot shot down in Afghanistan; but he seems in a confusing state of mind.  In reality, scientific/medical technology has tapped into what is left of his brain (not much body left).  He is being used to travel back in time for 8 minute stretches.  He appears on a commuter train in Chicago just before a bomb goes off and kills everyone on board.  His mission is to stop it.  It takes him several attempts in consecutive 8 minute time frames.  Generally I'm not much for this \\"Groundhog Day\\" style of filmmaking but here Jones manages to change the environment enough that the story remains interesting.  Mid-movie the film becomes a traditional thriller as Colter (Jake G.) gets ever closer to the terrorist.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out, directed at mainstream filmgoers.  Some will hate it.  Overall, this is certainly satisfying entertainment in a spring full of popcorn worthy films.
B003VANOFY|1.0|This is one big let down from Logitech. Crackling sound won't go away. I plugged the dongle without the USB hub but no luck. I disabled some functions in the bios but the crackling is driving me crazy. I can't even watch a movie or play a game. It was a huge mistake that I even thought about buying it.  BTW this is my computer's specs:  Gigabyte 990FXA-UD5  AMD Phenom II X6 1100T  8GB 1866 RAM  HD Radeon Sapphire 6970 2GB  Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
B002MCYWIU|4.0|We borrowed the ibert from a friend to see if we'd like it. It was ok however there are some major flaws. The ibert DOES NOT fit on male mountain bikes. We tried on 2 different mountain bikes (specialized and another brand) and on both it was impossible to put on. Also the ibert makes it difficult to steer and the kids can mess with your gears.   This was much better than the ibert. It's really easy to install and fit perfectly on my husbands mountain bike. The seat does look ridiculously small but both my child (1.5 years old) and his cousin who is 2.5 years old fit perfectly in it. They are both of average weight and height for their age so I think this could easily fit a 3-4 year old. If you are short this seat might not work for you as my husband who is 5'9 bikes slightly bow legged with this seat but is not uncomfortable.
B004AKCME8|5.0|a top film well worth watching,very enteraining with an excelent story and music score.I would recommend this film to all my family and i think people of all ages will enjoy it.
B003Y5H574|1.0|Love the movie!! Its great i recommend it to everyone! But if your buying this for a digital copy like I was don't bother It does not go on your Ipod! WTF! If you want this on your iTunes account it wont work :  Just buy the DVD or the Blu-Ray and download it from your iTunes account if want a digital copy.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|This well written, well rounded book took me by surprise. Like most fairly aware people I thought I had a handle on Steve Jobs, but I was wrong. Most of my knowledge of Jobs came from the dim past, the early PC days, and I had ignored much of his contribution to the present day techno world. Well worth a read.
B005SAMGJU|5.0|the album is incredible and highly recommend it on vinyl. Fast shipping, great record. Feist knocks it out of the park with every album and this one is no different. Superb.
B000N3ST8O|1.0|I ordered this directly from Amazon as new.  The CD was used with plenty of scratches on the disc.  I'm very disappointed to say the least.
1594202842|5.0|At first I thought that this was a one- idea book that would simply illustrate the idea with the narrative i.e. The Chinese way of parenting, the way of forcing the child to work hard, to be obedient and respectful to the parents, to forget  the 'fun nonsense' in which American young people waste their time would lead to 'success' for the children. Or to say this another way the American method of indulging the children of doing everything to make them happy of instantly gratifying their every need proves to be a loser in the long run. It is damaging ultimately to the children. The message of the book is that if you enable the children through hard work to develop real ability and skill they will have the kind of success and self- respect in life which will be good to them. The way to be good is to be hard on them when they are young so that they can reap the rewards of their success in life.<br />The book that tells the story of this ethic in practice is written by the mother Amy Chua. She reveals herself to be a particularly difficult and extreme practicioner of what she calls the 'Chinese method of education' Her daughter Sophia is the pianist, her second daughter Lulu is the violinist and Amy is at every lesson and practice, pushing the children on. She gives them total attention and dedication works hard for them. And when accused of doing it all for herself she says that the Chinese view is that the children are extensions of one's own self. She was the perfectly obedient daughter to her own highly successful father and to her mother and this is what she expects from her children.<br />She herself has 'global reputation' and is a successful law- professor as is her husband. She writes admiringly of her non- Chinese in fact Jewish husband but in the afterword explains that she left out at his request much of the material about him. She thus does not speak to much about the Jewish success ethic ,if there is such a thing. Perhaps had she really inquired into this she would have compared the Jewish and Chinese records of success in various efforts and understood that discipline, hard work alone are not the only element in great creative achievement. She does however indicate her husband her mother- in- law are much more in favor of giving the child greater independence and opportunity to enjoy life and develop creatively in their own way.<br />In any case the successful formula breaks down with the rebellion of the second daughter Lulu. This is the main theme of the second part of the book. However the most deeply moving element in the book comes through the illness of Amy's much beloved best friend third - sister Kristin. Here is where the human condition seems to put the whole question of ' success' in a slightly different perspective.<br />The book ends with the story still open with it not being clear whether the methods of mother Amy have truly brought about the desired result.<br />My own thought is a certain perplexity at a mother who cares so much for her children having in a way chosen for them 'careers' in which top-of- the - hill success is so rare. There is also clearly a feeling I am sure shared by others that the 'tiger mother' was simply too much, too obsessed. And also I might add too impressed by 'material' accompaniments of success. The question of the real overall well- being of the children is not I believe considered fully.<br />I wonder too about the theme of these two children having to not simply realize the expectations of such an overbearing parent but 'compete' with two very highly successful people.<br />In any case once again this is a very thought- provoking book, and truly moving in certain parts.ld have compared the Jewish and Chinese records of success in various efforts and understood that discipline, hard work alone are not the only element in great creative achievement.

B0061US58C|3.0|My three year old was obsessed with the first Cars movie.  We must have watched it a thousand times.  Cars 2 was his first theatre experience, and as a parent I was pretty disappointed.  Two main reasons:  1.  This was shockingly violent.  I never expected to be sitting and watching thousands of bullets fly through the air and \\"kill\\" cars and trucks.  I'm not usually one who notices violence in films, but considering the fact that Disney has made boatloads of cash with licensed products for 3-4 year olds featuring Lightning McQueen, the violence was inappropriate.  2. The writers seemed to have become enamored with the Maters Tall Tales concept, and got carried away.  First of all the whole spy parody thing is totally over a young kids head, and frankly, even for the typical parent of a 3-5 year old, spy films aren't exactly relevant either.  My parents grew up on Bond films but not my generation.   All this being said, fast forward six month later and my then-just barely three-year old is now closer to being a four year old, and we've watched the movie again twice in two days on streaming video, and he loves it.  So what the hell do I know?

0525423656|3.0|Unless you have total recall, you absolutely must re-read Matched before reading Crossed. Or, read the Amazon reviews of Matched and look for 'spoilers' so you remember plot details. I was incredibly lost when I started reading Crossed and had to periodically go back to the Amazon reviews of the first book (I gave away my copy of Matched). The author continually referenced details from Matched without any 'reminiscing' by the characters, which made it very hard to follow. Does anyone remember what the different color pills were for? Remember the details of Grandpa's death? Crossed also is confusing because it goes back and forth with different chapters from different points of view. More than once, I had to go back to see whose point of view I was reading. Matched was a great 5-star book where you fell in love with all the characters and there was action and excitement and romance and amazing creativity on the part of the author. This one doesn't live up to the original. But those of you who loved Matched will enjoy seeing how the story progresses (albeit a very slow progression) and I look forward to reading the final book in the series. I hope the author will tell us what happens to all the characters in this book, since the best character in this one is the little boy. No spoilers - enough said. Oh, one more thing. Page 144 says \\"who killed all thsee people?\\" In the era of spellcheck this shouldn't happen.

0061777269|2.0|After watching a Science Channel documentary about near death experiences, I was intrigued enough to go to Amazon and look through what they had there. I found this book by reading through the reviews and most of them suggested that this book was promising. Unfortunately this was not my experience:  First of all, the book has been translated and reads like the chapters were either written for seperate publication or that a long time had passed before the next was started. There are a lot of redunancies in observations, sentences even whole concepts. This is tiring to experience and makes you lose confidence in the narrative thread.   The chapters are not linked together in a coherent whole They are diffuse, describing (and in many cases redescribing) the traits of near death experiences (NDEs) then going on sometimes minute dissertations on the working of the brain. These discussions as well as the writing about quantum theory are extremely important to the subject but the linking is never made clear. it seems some chapters are devoted to the general audience and others are geared towards specialists, but you need to understand all of them in order to come away with a total understanding of the topic, and unfortunately, no one \\"tone\\" is consistent enough to appeal.  Whether because of translation, or because it is from the perspective of a scientist, it reads very dry. Earnest, non-condescending but dry and is by turns too simplistic or too obtuse. When the central implication is finally presented it is like seeing a beautiful waterfall briefly free from cloud cover; transcendent but fleeting, and sure enough the book continues to trudge on with more hidebound penumbra frustrating any arc the reader tries to impose on it.  The descriptions of the NDE's are the best part. Stories of people's life changing experiences often told with their own words are inherently gripping and the promise of what the book's subject implies about our own future is ultimately more important. But this book piggybacks on those things without adding anything more compelling.

B003L77GRO|5.0|I'm pretty much livid that there is no way to watch Season 6 until it has finished its first broadcast run.  Showtime needs to expand its horizons, and let amazon.com stream seasons of Dexter the way they do Breaking Bad and other great shows.  I'm sure the broadcasting networks come out just fine in terms of profit.  I will never go back to the zillion worthless channels, commercial-ridden concept of satelite and cable.  Streaming is the only way for me.<br /><br />Back to Season 5.  This season had to build in a different way because of Kim's murder in Season 4, which I consider to be near-masterpiece material, with John Lithgow proving he was the embodiment of evil.  This season worked well as a bridge, with Julia Styles creating a lead-female diversion, but didn't have quite the edge of Season's 3 & 4.<br /><br />The plot really carried the season, as opposed to Emmy-worthy acting.  Roles became quirky, but not intense.  Still, next to Breaking Bad it is the best drama on TV.  That is high praise from me.  Dexter also retains its sense of humor, where Breaking Bad became so intense in the last season that smiles were few and far between, Dexter always has Yamana, not to mention Dexter's always chuckle-worthy internal dialogues with himself and Harry.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|Note:  This review also applies to [[ASIN:B004RFYEEC The Smile Sessions Box Set]].<br /><br />Other than The Beatles' GET BACK album, which still has not been released in its original form (the Spectorized [[ASIN:B0025KVLV0 Let It Be (Remastered)]] and the remixed, de-Spectorized [[ASIN:B0000DJZA5 Let It Be... Naked]] notwithstanding), The Beach Boys' SMiLE project is the most famous (and maybe infamous) unreleased album in rock history.  Originally planned as a follow-up to 1966's [[ASIN:B00005ASHM Pet Sounds]], Brian Wilson scrapped the project in mid-1967 after months of work, believing he had lost his competition with The Beatles, and the pressures from the other Beach Boys, plus legal problems with Capitol Records, finally wore him down.<br /><br />A replacement album, [[ASIN:B000002TR9 Smiley Smile]], cobbled together by the group using only the \\"Good Vibrations\\" single and fragments from the original sessions - the rest of the album was rerecorded - was a critical and commercial flop.  Fragments of SMiLE were issued on later Beach Boys albums such as [[ASIN:B000002TRD 20/20]] and [[ASIN:B000008DA7 Surf's Up]].  In 1993, about an hour of lost SMiLE music was issued on the [[ASIN:B000002UR4 Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys]] boxed set.  Then, in 2004, Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks completed a new version of SMiLE and recorded it with Brian's new band, The Wondermints ([[ASIN:B0002LI11M Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]); a live concert version, recorded earlier that year in London, was also issued on DVD.<br /><br />Now, with the impending 50th anniversary of The Beach Boys approaching, Capitol Records, along with Brian, has released two versions of THE SMiLE SESSIONS - a basic two-disc version, and a nine-disc box set (five CDs, two vinyl LPs, and two vinyl 45 RPM singles).  The first CD, which contains the same contents in both releases, contains a newly revised SMiLE album, using the same running order as the 2004 remake, giving us an idea of what the album would have sounded like in 1967.  Most of the tracks are mono, as Brian always preferred; he was deaf in one ear, and could not hear stereo sound properly, and as a producer, he believed that only mono mixes could present the music to the listener as he wanted it heard.  Stereo, Brian believed, left too much to the listener's equipment setup.  While I would have loved to have a stereo version of the album, as was done with [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]] box set in 1996, the producers explained that unlike Pet Sounds, most of the multi-track masters and many of the components were lost, so a stereo remix of SMiLE was impossible to produce.<br /><br />The second CD of the first version contains session highlights from \\"Our Prayer\\" to \\"Good Vibrations\\" - more than enough to satisfy the casual Beach Boy fan.  The deluxe box set is aimed more at collectors and die-hards, and what a collection it is.  CD1 is identical to the first version, but CDs 2 through 5 contain a very comprehensive view of the SMiLE sessions.  So comprehensive, in fact, that the \\"Heroes and Villains\\" sections take up about 90 percent of CD2, and the \\"Good Vibrations\\" sessions take up all of CD5.  While somewhat repetitive, the session tapes offer fascinating listening, showing Brian's perfectionism and dedication to getting the right sound.  I'm sure he drove the other musicians and the other Beach Boys crazy, but it was obviously worth the effort.<br /><br />The two-LP vinyl album in the deluxe edition follows tracks 1-19 of CD1 for the first three sides.  The fourth side contains rare stereo mixes that are not included on the CDs.  The two 45s are the singles that never were, the two-part \\"Heroes and Villains\\" single, and the \\"Vega-Tables\\"/\\"Surf's Up\\" single.<br /><br />Packaging and amenities are impressive.  The two-disc set includes a colorful 36-page booklet, a SMiLE button, and a fold-out poster of the album artwork.  The deluxe edition is even more impressive; the artwork on the box cover has 3-D graphics; the inside of the box lid has the original back cover of the Duophonic (fake stereo) release of the album, had it been issued.  Inside the box are a 60-page hardcover book with additional essays and a complete sessionography; a double-gatefold sleeve with slots for all five CDs and the two vinyl 45s; the two-record vinyl album in a mono jacket with a gatefold sleeve and a 10\\" photo album inside; and a giant-economy-size version of the album artwork poster.<br /><br />The casual fan will probably make do with the two-disc set, but collectors will want both.<br /><br />I'd love to see The Beatles and Apple do a similar box set for the GET BACK SESSIONS, not to mention the long-lost LET IT BE DVD.<br /><br />Some additional observations:<br /><br />1) The vinyl LP and singles sound fine. I especially enjoyed the stereo mixes on Side 4, but wish that they had been on the CD releases. Although I grew up with vinyl, after listening to CDs for over 20 years, vinyl just sounds flat.<br /><br />2) The 45 versions of \\"Vega-Tables\\" and \\"Surf's Up\\" are the same as on the LP and CD.<br /><br />3) If you have the big box set, \\"Heroes and Villains Part 1\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains Part 2\\" are only available on the vinyl 45, though the individual modules for these tracks are probably scattered throughout the four Sessions CDs. The only way to get the full versions of \\"Heroes and Villains Part 1\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains Part 2\\" on CD is to buy the two-disc set (Tracks 2 and 3 on CD2). All of the other tracks on that disc can be found on the session box set, although some of them are edited (particularly the \\"Good Vibrations\\" sessions).<br /><br />4) I compared the 20/20 versions of \\"Cabin Essence\\" and \\"Our Prayer,\\" and the 1971 version of \\"Surf's Up,\\" to the SMiLE versions. Save for stereo remixing and overdubs, the versions are almost identical.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Love the Harry Potter movies.  I (and it appears most other reviewers) don't want the \\"Ultraviolet\\" digital copy. If we're paying extra for the digital copy version, give us the one we want - the same one you've been giving us all along: iTunes.  And, while I'm complaining, don't make us wait forever for the extended versions of all the movies in one blu-ray box set. I'm buying the cheapest available version of this movie (only so I can still watch it while I wait - previous ones I just have on DVD) and you're not getting another penny from me until the blu-ray box set we really want has been released. I don't have a lot of extra money to waste on anything less than the best.

6305428042|4.0|4 Stars =Classic<br /><br />\\"Hocus Pocus\\" is a children's Halloween story about the Sanderson sisters, Witches, Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, & Kathy Najimy, who rise from the grave after a three hundred year slumber to suck out the life essence of all the children from Salem, MA, so they can remain eternally young. The same thing they tried three hundred years before, but were caught & hanged for. Max, played by Omri Katz, lights the \\"Black Flame Candle\\" as a joke gone bad, & resurrects the three witches in the process, who have their sight set on his little sister, Dani.<br /><br />There is a heavy Moe, Curly, & Larry (the Three Stooges) influenced performance from our three witches, as the fumble & bumble their way through the film. Funny performances are given by all three actresses, but Sarah Jessica Parker's performance as the sexy, boy crazy, dumb blonde gets my vote for performance of the show between the three. To bad the rest of the characters of the film are not up to that level, with the exception of Dani, played by Thora Birch, the young sister of Max, who just about steals every scene she is in. One of the cutest little girls outside of Phoebe, in \\"the Monster Squad\\" to appear in a children's horror/comedy the last 25 years.<br /><br />\\"Hocus Pocus\\" is filled with great decorated sets & cinematography. It does actually catch the fondly remembered childhood innocence of Halloween, & not for only children, but us older children will enjoy watching the film too, remembering the days of \\"Trick or Treat.\\"
B001OQCV2E|1.0|How many times can you out run mother nature, cause in reality you can't. This movie gave us that cliched thing that we have seen over and over in every other natural disaster flick along with cliched dialogue and cliched characters and we are suppose to suspend reality for a moment and just be awed by the graphics that did most of the work for the film while the actors depended on them to carry the film.  The only interesting character throughout this whole fim is Woody Harrelson (who is very underrated) He is the only life support for this film but he's quickly killed off, should have made his character survive so he could have given Oliver Platt and Danny Glover's characters a piece of his mind, that would have made for more interesting dialogue than the train wreck we were subject to during this film.  There wasn't any character development at all in this film, so we could care less whether or not these people kicked the bucket or not. I'll start with the step-boyfriend who John Cusack's children loved but he was just an ass throwing out insults about the children's father right in front of the children and calling two old women \\"old bags\\" while trying to escape and why do the kids love someone like this? Is this someone that kids are suppose to admire and love over their own father who doesn't bad mouth anyone? The boyfriend only had like what 2 lessons in flying a plane but able to fly a small rickety plane and a huge plane with ease....GMAFB, their asses would have crashed the moment they took off.  Poor Thandie Newton who is a phenomenal actress is reduced to just standing there and being pretty. An actress like her should have been given time to shine and out perform most of the actors in this film but she's just used as a decoration in this film. She had nothing but cliched lines.  Chiwetel Elji-whatever he had his moments in the film, but wasn't enough to save the film and all his predictions didn't pan out, so he looked more like an idiot more than anything.  Danny Glover is just the soft spoke president and nothing more, he had no depth at all in this film for the presidential character, which is a shame a talented actor wasted here.  Oliver Platt was just the government bad guy, how original, you just wanted to see him get swept up by a tidal wave and clobbered by a lava rock.  The Russians were just stereotypical cliched characters with no real depth to them besides being rich and having a big plane.  John Cusack is the divorced lovable father who has the admiration of his daughter and the stuck up snotty attitude of his son who needed to get back slapped a couple of times but suddenly is nice to dad when the world is about to crumble...ok.  Amanda Peet, is just useless in this movie no real reason for her character to even much be in this film. All she did was scream and holler, you think I'm talking about while disaster is happening but no she's screaming and hollering at anything besides disaster and when her boyfriend is crushed to death by gears, she shows not one single emotion and quickly slobbers all over John Cusack like she never had a boyfriend.  Just a ridiculous movie with ridiculous characters except for Woody Harrelson.

B000GH2YPG|5.0|Monday, 7 November 2011<br />I first read this book in 1980, and liked it then .I have read it  now after31 years , and rate it as a true Classic .Daphne Du Maurier  got it published in 1938 , when she was 31 years old .She tore up the initial fifteen thousand -word long draft, and wrote it a second time.<br />The most striking feature of the novel is its suspense and mystery , which Du Maurier has been able to maintain till the very end. Rebecca is the first wife of Maxim  De Winter , and is dead.Her story is revealed through the second wife of Maxim, who does not reveal her  own name in the book .No doubt , Rebecca is the real heroine.She is a powerful character.Even though dead , she lives through her house-keeper Mrs Danvers, who adores Rebecca and is fiercely loyal to her, even after Rebecca's death .So much so that when she learns about the real cause of death , she sets the beautiful mansion  called Manderley on fire and completely destroys it .<br />Rebecca was a complex personality. She was beautiful and magnetic.She had beauty , brains and breeding .But the marriage of Maxim and Rebecca was a failure , right from the start .She had a number of male friends and \\"lovers\\" in London and even around Manderley.She was not in love with anyone .Love-making was a game with her, as Mrs Danvers would later reveal .But she suffered from  Cancer too , and this secret she had kept even from her most loyal house-keeper also .Probably , before her death , she had only three or four more months to live .<br />Maxim's marriage with the narrator of the novel , who is young and nearly half his age, takes place , on the proposal of Maxim , one year after the death of Rebecca.Though he says he loves her , it is doubtful, as reflected by his conduct .Perhaps he needed a companion.She , on the other hand , loves him , and is ready to  blindly support him , even when she finds him involved in murder.She is timid , under-confident and over awed by the shadow of Rebecca , in the beginning , but slowly and steadily , overcomes all her fears and becomes confident .<br />The mystery whether the death of Rebecca would be proved murder or suicide , remains till the very end .<br />The book is very subversive about the idea of love .Neither Rebecca , nor Maxim seem to care for love .The burden of love is carried by the nameless, poor  , timid , narrator , the second wife of Maxim de Winter.<br />The book has poetry and imagery , mystery and suspense , and much more qualities that makes it truly classic . The book needs to be read , re-read , and re-examined by everyone.inning , but slowly and steadily , overcomes all her fears and becomes confident .<br />The mystery whether the death of Rebecca would be proved murder or suicide , remains till the very end .<br />The book is very subversive about the idea of love .Neither Rebecca , nor Maxim seem to care for love .The burden of love is carried by the nameless, poor  , timid , narrator , the second wife of Maxim de Winter.<br />The book has poetry and imagery , mystery and suspense , and much more qualities that makes it truly classic .

0062059882|5.0|I've read the earlier version of American Gods many times, so I notice the changes ... and approve of them.<br />Hard to believe that so good a book can be bettered.<br />Its only flaw, in my opinion, was that Neil didn't mention until late in the book that his protagonist is a person of color. In the US, and especially in the south, this would still affect how people treat him. Perhaps not so much as was true 50 years ago, but still ...<br />Now, it's mentioned in an early scene.<br />6/15/2015. I just finished rereading this version (a bit less surprising, the fourth time through) and it is still splendid. I read it on Kindle, which apparently Amazon is aware of. He sees you when you're sleeping; he knows when you're awake.<br />Now I'm reading Anansi Boys again on Kindle. I am less engaged with our hero, I have to say.

B005F96URI|4.0|This appears to be another take on genre-crossing in a genre-style movie.  Previous examples include the wildly successful Sin City movies, popular western splices like The Good The Bad and The Weird and The Warrior's Way, and the stillborn Sucker Punch.  But all these movies were well-advertised and wide theatrical releases (in Asia, at least, for The Good The Bad and The Weird).  Should I approach this lack of advertising as a snake's rattle and keep my expectations low?  When I stumbled across this I thought \\"This movie features Josh Hartnett, Demi Moore, Ron Perlman, Woody Harrelson and Kevin McKidd, and I had never heard of it or saw a trailer.  How does that happen?  Is this a weird little gem waiting to be discovered, or an utter Sucker Punch tragedy?\\"<br /><br /> The opening credits are cleverly presented during an animated story background.  The style was much like that of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One or Hellboy 2: The Golden Army.  When moviemakers really care about a movie, they make an effort to have the opening credits \\"affect\\" the viewer somehow.  Even if it's only music over a black screen, moods are set and pace is foreshadowed.  I've commented on the great opening credits of The Good The Bad and The Weird, and that movie was awesome.  This made for a promising start.<br /><br /> In this perhaps futuristic world guns have somehow been banned, making way for a resurgence in swordsmanship and a feudal yakuza-esque gang culture.  A young, Doc Holidayish brawler (Hartnett) and a swordless samurai team up to exact their revenge against the ruthless king of the hill, \\"The Woodsman\\" (Perlman).  To do so, they must kill their way through leagues of henchman and his nine right hand men, one of which is played by a sleek Kevin McKidd.<br /><br />This film is VERY stylistic.  The effects and music smack of Scott Pilgrim versus The World with comic book stylings of villainy and storyline much like Kill Bill.  The combat follows suit, with choreography focusing more on a dance-like technical precision than producing a realistic fight.  It's more like theater than cinema.  In fact, the set designers erected intentionally artificial-looking structures in order to unsubtly accent this feeling.  Sets and wardrobe contain elements of the present, the future, the old west, and the early 1900's.  Many theatrical devices are employed as well.  All of this synergistically produces an other-worldly feel.<br /><br />The style of this movie is rare and difficult to execute.  The fights are fun, the scenes are clever, and (with the exception of Demi Moore's role) the characters were interesting.  If you are careful about your expectations, this movie could be a great pick for you.e-like technical precision than producing a realistic fight.  It's more like theater than cinema.

B005VMSATA|1.0|It was not quite as awful as I had heard, perhaps owing entirely to low expectations. It wasn't as \\"pretty\\" as I am sure they had hoped it would be, and \\"pretty\\" is about all it had going for it. The plot is forgettable, the actors are clearly forcing it, and ... Yeah, that's about it.<br />Buy it if you're a comic book nerd and want to encourage the studios to keep trying. Then stick it at the back of your shelf and watch something else.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I disagree entirely with the negative reviews written -- this was an excellent film, if you are a fan!  Compelling story, great actors, exciting to watch.  Don't get fooled by the reviews.  See it and decide for yourself!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|The reason I say most don't know what they are talking about is because most people who give it bad reviews is because the story line is not like the first movie.  First this movie is not geared toward the young audience the first one was. The first Cars movie is great as well but geared toward 3-11 while this one is geared toward 8-16 years old.  Believe me when I say Pixar is all professional all the time and they do extensive research into their stories to make them look, feel, and conversate apropretely better then any other studio. People feel they missed the ball however if you watch interviews about it you will see they were aiming for a higher age with a faster pace and spy theme. They straight out say they didn't want to create a remake of the first.  I do have a child who is 4 and who just loves the first and really likes this second but I know she doesn't fully understand it and thats ok because as she gets older she will gain more appreciation for its storyline and not just its characters.  Bottom line its done very well with a good storyline and fantastic anamation however if you are wishing for a remake of the first you are not going to be happy. People downgrade it for the remake they wanted and not for the spy sequal they got.
0553573403|5.0|I just can't stop reading! I am on the third book of the series now, and it gets even better! Go for it.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I got this video for my 6yr old grandaughter - and even with all of the new amazing technology available, she absolutely loved this movie!  She still talks about it and wants to watch it again.  It was wonderful to share something from my childhood with her that she equally enjoyed without thinking it was \\"old or outdated\\".
B004LP601S|5.0|Great album, quick and simple!!  If you loved the first album and are a \\"true\\" Panic fan, then you won't be disappointed with this album!  Cheers!
B004G25V9S|3.0|I was glad to hear that Cookie left this band.This led me to believe a possible fresh approach. I was tired of his singing and they missed him back on Sesame. Seriously, this CD is just OK. A couple of good songs here and there- but very fragmented. I'm not sure how to pin-point the areas of weakness. Here's a thought-maybe this band needs the other guitarist, Lindgren. Nobody has really mentioned this but I think this is the added dynamic that has been missing lately in this band. Just like in the band Hoax. In the past, there was thought about tossing out the other member but now there is the realization that the added dynamic/tension/frustration brings about the best in composition. Just some food for thought. Demon of the Fall, Wreath, The Drapery Falls, - now those are fresh ear-opening compositions.
B004N6369Y|4.0|I really did like this book.  I have read better by Steel, but I have also read worse by her as well.  It was a great, light read.  It was easy to pick up and put down.  It was definitely not a complex Russian novel or anything, but I read it knowing that.  It was just a nice kind of quick book to read.  Sure, it was a little slow at times, but I think that the events that unfolded also kept my interest as well.
B005IY3DP2|4.0|In regards to human interaction, an ability to predict reactions and form ideas about general disposition is both useful and desirable.  In music, however, an unsuspected slap in the face--or the more pleasant equivalent, for those who find pain to be aversive--can actually be advantageous.  This is why Velociraptor, complete with an aptly placed exclamation point, proves that dissociation has its perks.<br /><br />Velociraptor! opens with eerie moanings and trumpets that quickly dissolve into a familiar sounding, upbeat affair, albeit with a residual ominous imprint.  There are several other nostalgia-inducing tracks that expose obvious 60s and 70s rock influences--minus the shiny, happy metaphors to bury the gritty subject matter.  Then, just when Kasabian has the audience comfortable, along comes \\"Days are Forgotten,\\" to render the listener completely seized by the maniacal chanting, guttural beats, and hauntingly delivered hook.<br /><br />This pattern continues throughout the album, as Kasabian proceeds to rile, then soothe their audience with a rollercoaster of musical trials that is likely to leave listeners fervently seeking out the band's earlier works.  Most of the tracks are pure masterpieces; a couple start out strong but never seem to fully reach a summit; but all of them work together toward an exhilarating thesis of...antithesis.

0385534639|4.0|After hearing so much about \\"The Night Circus,\\" I decided to order it and read it within a weekend. Bottom line: It was entertaining and I really enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />Morgernstern really excels at creating an atmosphere with her words. The many facets of the circus are beautiful and dreamlike. I loved getting lost in her skillfully created imagery. This kept the book interesting and made me hooked.<br /><br />I will say, however, that the story itself can seem to move a little slowly at times and then jump to the next plot point. I did grow a little frustrated at having pages and pages of detail and imagery with less focus on the characters themselves. Sometimes, the plot would change so quickly after pages of nothing that I would have to go back and check to make sure of what just happened.<br /><br />Overall, though, the book is lovely and engaging enough to make you not care so much about its flaws. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy or has a free weekend.

B003HARV98|5.0|This album was a long time coming for me after hearing her on MySpace back when it was still relevant. She was kind enough to share versions of many of the tracks that ultimately ended up on the album, and thankfully the final versions weren't killed with too much production. Not to say she doesn't have fun with the whole pop genre, but the fun stayed intact. Whenever I need something simultaneously energizing, goofy, and somehow badass, I can always put on Marina and end up smiling.

B003Q3F0OE|3.0|Ben Garvey (Paul Walker) finds himself afoul of the law and is subsequently dispatched. He knows this should be the end if he wakes up to find himself any serial is the place supposedly as a groundskeeper in a mental institution. He tries to accept this but things just don't add up. We live through this with them as everybody tries to help him adjust to his new existence. But something just does not seem right. Been being resourceful tries to figure out what it is. Will he be able to put his finger on it? Will he be dispatched again? Or incarcerated in the very Institute that he is the groundskeeper of? Watch and see is been in his trusty dog discover the secret of the Lazarus Project.<br /><br />The acting was par and the environment adequate. However the pacing is excruciatingly slow. We have time to second-guess long before it happens. Actually this might be a waste of time even for people that like this genre of movies.
B003L77G6A|4.0|I think that Big Bang is one of the funniest shows on TV. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes the sexual inuendo is way to strong. On the plus side it is one of the few shows that started out hilariously in the very first episode and has kept it at the same hilarious level all the way through season 4. To many shows seem to run out of steam after the first or second season and then they just get stupid, even though they run on and on and on. Great job writers and cast!
B004VMVTNU|3.0|I originally rated this app a give star app. I'm dropping it a star because it dots not adjust for daylight savings. I could live with it for falling back because out just woke me up an hour early, but this will be unacceptable if out is ask still a problem by the time we spring forward.  I had set the alarm on saturday night for sunday morning. The alarm said it was set for &quot;X&quot; hours from now.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Before I wasted any money on this record, I went ahead and listened to it for free over at loureedmetallica.com.  Man am I glad I made that decision.  This thing is utter horse****.  Lou Reed is a bum looking to ride on the coattails of the once great Metallica.  He is looking for a quick cash grab to hopefully get him through the next six months or so financially.  I am a Velvet Underground fan but Reed is just flat out embarrassing on this recording.  He snivels about little dog's private parts and how much of a failure he is as a man.  The dog doesn't get fed and gets left out in the cold,  BOO FREAKING HOO!  Ulrich's playing could be equated to that of a drunken mongoloid on elephant tranquilizers.  Each hit of the stick is filled with complete and total fail.  Way to phone it in yet again Lars, you little, little man with an ego the size of the black hole that is Lulu.  Hetfield is Hetfield with his annoying vocal phrasing and overt use of drawing out the final syllable of every freaking word.  Hammett and the bass player are just there for the ride and what a waste of studio time and electricity it all was.  A few decent guitar riffs pop up in maybe a half dozen sections of the songs but overall Lulu is pure nonsense.  Plain and simple.  The handlers of both parties should be fired.  I would have no problem if this record was just a fun experiment and the boys put it out there as a cheap mp3 download.  The fact that they think its worthy of all the pomp and circumstance and super deluxe issues further demonstrates out of control delusions of grandeur.  The whole thing has to be a massive troll.  About the only good thing that will hopefully come out of this is a funny bit on the resurrected Beavis and Butthead where they rip this monstrosity of bs to pieces.
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|I think its really cute and looks a lot like Gizmo. But I was disappointed that all it did was sing and nothing else. I mean it rocks like he does in the movie. But the mouth doesn't move and the arms or legs don't move. The head I guess moves a little. I really like it but I guess I was hoping for something more of a Gizmo that is like the Furbys or FurReal animals. Now that would be a great toy. Having it move, talk, and sing like the realy Gizmo. Even have some of his cute facial expressions from the movie. It looks like the same size he really would be in the movie which I do love. I think more people would prefer to buy something more furby or furreal animal like. It would be like really having Gixmo just a much safer version then in the movie. lol
0679731369|5.0|--I cant imagine any serious writer *not* wolfing this fare down as greedily as I did. It is--at its heart--primarily a story about telling stories. But that isnt to say that a non-writer wont enjoy \\"Flaubert's Parrot.\\" I can hardly imagine any serious reader not being fascinated, as I was, by what Barnes has to say and the elegant, inventive, often unpredictable way he says it.<br /><br />\\"Flaubert's Parrot\\" is part literary criticism, part biography, part detective story, part love story. And if that's not enough, its also a cosmic musing on the nature of life and death, truth and beauty, Art, deception and survival. The novel's protagonist, a retired doctor turned amateur Flaubert scholar, is a widower coming to terms with the loose ends that remain at the end of a non-fictional life, not only his wife's, not only Flaubert's, but his own. A book, to paraphrase Barnes, is where everything is explained to you in the end. Life, on the other hand, is where nothing is explained.<br /><br />In tracking down the \\"facts\\" of Flaubert's life, including what became of the stuffed parrot Flaubert used as inspiration for one of his stories, Geoffrey Braithwaite, the semi-reliable narrator of \\"Flaubert's Parrot,\\" defends, admires, and sympathizes with his subject warts and all, even as he acknowledges that the \\"truth\\" of Flaubert--or any of us-- is a horizon that stubbornly and forever recedes no matter how diligently and relentlessly we march towards it.<br /><br />Barnes is a beautiful prose stylist. His knowledge is encyclopedic. His narrative is full of trivia, gossip, historical sidebars, and digressions as fascinating as the main thrust of the plot. And there most definitely is a plot, in the conventional sense; but it's delivered by means of various inventive plot devices that keep a reader on his or her toes, forcing us to see anew the object of his obsession (Flaubert, ostensibly, but so much more than the dead literary genius) from so many different perspectives we are left dazzled and speechless by the awesome complexity of it all. Barnes will not be appreciated for these qualities, the very qualities that make him such a superb writer, by a good many readers, those who prefer their narratives served up ABCDE with an explanatory epilogue as dessert. Nor will he be appreciated by readers who don't understand why anyone should care about Literature. Or Flaubert. Or his parrot.<br /><br />Dont let the reviews of such readers dissuade you.<br /><br />This is a 5-star book if there ever was one. The first Julian Barnes book I ever read; it won't be my last (unless I drop dead before tomorrow when I plan to start another... \\"The History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters.\\"s by the awesome complexity of it all.

B0060YIBLK|5.0|As a communications instructor, I continue to look for information to share with students that will help them become even more effective in their relationships at work, home, and with friends. This book has positively impacted my ability to begin conversations with anyone and to develop rapport with people in all levels of my organization, as well as those in my personal life. I find myself consciously implementing the techniques he recommends and sharing my own communication success stories with family and friends. Today, effective communication skills are a top priority in every field, and this book offers practical examples anyone can learn to apply. This is a must-read book that is easy to understand (great anecdotes!) and that will help you realize just how easy it is to establish and maintain connections with anyone.
B000OCZBS0|5.0|From the beginning to the end, the Butcher's Ballroom is an excellent music trip. Its danceable jazz-like rhythm mixed with powerful opera singing and richly arranged double bass and brass results in a fresh and most enjoyable sound, without losing any power in its scraping sounding metallic guitar riffs. It's like heavy boogie, or rock & roll & metal, but not as if it only got those two poles playing at the same time each one on its own; on the contrary, its the result of masterfully combining both fields to make one solid, well-balanced, great and rich music. I love it.
B00318COS4|5.0|This was a great game!  I had not played one like it. It took longer to arrive at the house, but it was worth it.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Peter Sellers out does himself. With a supporting cast like this how could it be bad. George Scott is totally funny as Gen. Turgison. I grew up in this era and its a great parody of the times. Its a dark comedy about the cold war escalating into the final outcome. Slim Pickens will always be remembered for riding that Nuke down to the end. Loved this movie!! Its a keeper.

014241722X|1.0|I write for children, so of course I have read many children's books.  To be honest, I have not read any of John Grisham's adult novels, but I know, if his Theodore Boone books had been the first books he had written, they would never have been published.<br />Theodore Boone's character is a 20-30 year old man in a 13 year old body.  This is NOT a typical 13 year old.  Theodore Boone's character in both this book, and the second of its series is very atypical.  John Grisham, you have been a very successful writer for adults.  Since that has been your success, stick to writing for adults!
B002BGFUPQ|5.0|By far, this is the greatest movie that has ever been filmed. I'm not a huge Fast and Furious franchise fan and when I heard they were making a \\"drift\\" movie, I automatically wrote it off. I thought the movie would be horrible and a bad attempt at trying to cash in on the \\"drift\\" trend. HOWEVER, one day it was playing on TV and I had no idea what the name of the film was. I was shocked to find out it was the very same movie I thought was going to be horrible. If you view it as a comedy, it is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie ever filmed.

B005BJ7Y54|4.0|How rare and refreshing these days:  Not pop, not grunge, not rap.  Just... plain old rock.  But a rock album that is very well witten and extremely well played and performed.  Traces of various influences are detectable but the sound is uniquely their own.  Not too hard, but not  ballads either.  Definitely give this CD a try.  You'll be very glad you did.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|For my birthday, my daughter gave me the 007 James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set which included Casino Royale.  After my wife and I went through the set for the second time, we said to each other, \\"Wasn't there one called Never Say Never\\"?  I searched Amazon.com and found the title Never Say Never Again.

Tool never cease to continually improve upon their music, creativity, art, and philosophy. The production quality of this album is impeccable, as it should be. If you have never listened to Tool, this is a great album to become acquainted with their unique style. If you are already a fan of Tool, why don't you already own this?

And I loved how her relationship with Jack, the unbeknownst dashing American CEO of the company she's struggling to survive in, unfolded.  If you love Kinsella the way I do, I want to turn you on to another new author and Kindle book that you will equally love, The Body Snatcher Wears Lipstick by Artemis Hunt. Five stars from me!  It is so nice to see the great influence Ms Kinsella has had on other chick lit writers! Read these books!  You will not be sorry!  In fact, you'll be aching for more!
1400052181|5.0|LOVED LOVED this book. One of my co-workers gave it to me and I thought it was going to be a boring read. I was proven wrong because this book pulls you in. The story of Henriette Lacks and her family is just amazing to me. These cells haunted her family for years with no answers just them thinking there mom alive and being used. I fully recommend this book to people because it's such a great read. It s little slow in some parts but it has such a great meaning.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really liked this book, it's a change from the ordinary.  Think Harry Potter meets The Hunger games...Fun story that follows a teenage boy named Jacob. He lives an ordinary, boring life of a teenager.  His grandfather tells him tall tales of a place he once lived, a children's home filled with strange children that had \\"peculiar\\" abilities to do things like become invisible, levitate, bring things back to life, etc.  As a child he believes these stories (his grandfather has photos to back up the proof) however as he gets older he feels like he has been cheated and lied to until a fateful day when he begins a search to find not only himself, but also this fantasy world he has heard so much about.   True life meets fantasy, very intriguing and hard to put down.  It is filled with actual photographs that follow the story so you can get a visual on what you are imagining.    My only complaint was that the ending was very much of a cliffhanger, left you wondering...which I hate, but I would highly recommend this book and hope that Riggs writes a follow up, I would put any book down to read the sequel.
1423140591|5.0|The book came prompt, and in brand new condition as guaranteed.  The packaging was good and protected it well.  This is a fabulous book.  It gets off to a slow start since they are introducing you to new characters, but then...watch out.  I hope you are parked for a while because you will not want to put it down!
B004U52VPS|4.0|I wanted to like this toy so much, but the truth is, that it does not work well at all.  It is fun to assemble the stages with logs, pigs, etc.  I think this activity is great for kids and adults alike.  The difficult thing is to get the birds to fly correctly to know everything down.  Usually it does not happen.  Good try but hardly a good depiction of skill in this game.  I would say, it is more about luck!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Great view of a man who changed our lives.<br />Great book.
B005MWJ1VU|5.0|Dispatches is absolutely the best book about Vietnam -- and one of the best non-fiction books about anything -- I've ever read. Michael Herr's empathy and respect for the in-country GIs he spent time with is an anomaly in an era when most reporting on the war was skeptical and critical. Herr does not reveal whether he thinks the war is right or wrong. That, too, adds to the book's impact. Dispatches is touching, sad, funny and utterly gripping from beginning to end. If you only read one book about the Vietnam War, it should be this one.
B000001ESN|5.0|Really enjoy this Canadian trio, and Permanent Waves is an absolutely masterpiece. All the 6 songs are great! All the 6 really shine! If you like Rock music, you got to listen to Rush

THE ACTING IS PRETTY DARN GOOD,KILLING OF THE DOCTOR AND NURSES, SECURITY GUARD WASN'T BAD. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T KILL ANY ONE ELSE. GREAT SEQUEL SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION OF DVDS.
B0002EXH4A|1.0|This is my second favorite Megadeth album after \\"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\\"  I have a real soft spot for it in my heart and still go to it very often, probably even more often that \\"Peace Sells...\\" to be honest.  Unfortunately, the only digital copy I have is compiled of 128 kbps tracks (the \\"Hook In Mouth\\" file is 96 kbps!!!)  So, when I saw this I bought it and was truly excited to finally hear the album in all it's greatness.  Within the first few seconds of the first track, I knew something was wrong.  This is not a \\"remaster\\"... this is a \\"revision\\" and I'm 100% against this kind of thing.  Instrumentation has been added, vocals have been added and effects have been added throughout.  It's unlistenable.  I'm all for remastering old albums.  Clean stuff up, remove noise, remix, whatever.  But it should be against the law to ADD or DELETE content.  I know this album by heart and this isn't the album I grew to love.  Time to track down a vintage 1988 CD.  P.S. This reminds of when I bought my first DVD player and bought the \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\" of Night of the Living Dead.  One of the producers or writers actually FILMED \\"missing scenes\\" and had some goth synth musician create the \\"soundtrack they always wanted but couldn't afford\\"... what a travesty.  This is the same kind of travesty here.  Horrible.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I was very pleased with this video puchase.  My previous purchase of this Blu-Ray Disc was an inferior copy and all of the discs were spotty.  They had a lot of drop-outs on them.  This one was perfect and arrived in very quick time.

B004EPZ07U|5.0|I heard horrible things about this movie through initial reviews. I was skeptical about those reviews, due to my preconceptions about the character and story itself.  Getting this right out of the way, I am a comic fan. A fan of Green Lantern in comic book format for decades has perhaps given me some insight and perspective that many going in with no prior knowledge would not have. I watched this with my wife, who is not familiar with the comics or the story at all. She asked me a few minor questions about the universe that was presented to her through this film, but overall was more pleased with it than when we watched Thor or X-Men First Class. Yes, She enjoyed it and found less flaws in this as one story than either of the largely praised films from the publication competition. The reviews I believe to have been biased from the get-go do not do justice to this film.   I do believe they anticipated making a franchise out of Green Lantern, and not merely limiting it to this film alone. The setup for viewer understanding of the Guardians of the Galaxy granting power rings to the Corps of Green Lanterns was well done. The alien designs were accessible enough and the only major design flaw I saw was in the look of Parallax, which could have been done better if it had stuck with the look of the fear entity from the comics. Aside from the look of the main villain, I thought they did an excellent job setting up a vast and expansive universe that can easily hold the interest of a casual viewer. You do not have to have any prior knowledge of the comics to understand the story, and the character development felt natural and legitimate. I would definitely recommend this to any  person that enjoys fun action dramas and is willing to suspend disbelief enough to accept a scifi story where we are not alone in the universe.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|My favorite iMac died the same day he did.  I grieved for both and will continue to regret his leaving (bought a new iMac the next day).  The book is wonderful.  Well written with the necessary distance and the respectful personal presence to make it extraordinary.  I learned a lot about Steven Jobs and a lot about myself in the process...that is a powerful man.  Thank you for writing this book.
0385484518|5.0|This book is a MUST read for anyone who finds themselves on the treadmill of life or who fears dying. Morrie lives every moment to the fullest, whether living the moment in pain or with joy. Unashamed of tears or having to rely on others for his most basic needs as he grapples with a debilitating illness, Morrie teaches us to embrace it all. There are parts I will read over and over again to teach me to make the most of the life I have. Tuesdays with Morrie makes a great gift!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing is riding atop my Sandy bridge i5 2500.  I'm not over clocking, but a better cooling solution seemed necessary looking over the puny intel heat sink in the box.  I added a Scythe 120mm fan on the opposite side and it keeps the CPU between 20 and 30c for almost anything baring a hike when gaming.  The included fan is much quieter than the Scythe I added, but I usually keep earphones on anyway.    Just a note on installation.  It can be funky keeping the studs in the right place when you're lining it up with the bracket on the opposite side of the motherboard.  There are 3 slots for the studs to choose the right size for the CPU you use (Use the middle ones for Sandy Bridge) but it can be hell for a few moments getting it all lined up.  Other than that, I would only  make sure this will fit in your case as it does stand about as tall as the mammoth heat sinks you find Apple has on the Xeon processors in the Mac Pro.  Can't argue with the profile either.  It looks like a giant supercharger poking through the hood on a old Ford street rod.    This is a very well designed solution that functions great for anything I can think of baring the more extreme cooling needs of modders out there.  For the price, I don't think there is any competition for what you get.  This should be standard equipment for every processor.

1439192812|4.0|This book is, as always with mr. Dawkins, excellent. However, I will save the fifth star for the iPad version of the book, having heard it is even better and more beautiful than the paper book. The book is aimed at a younger audience so I guess it will be more suitable there than for us older readers.

B005COO1X6|5.0|I found Mile 81 to have that great mix of gruesomeness, nostalgia, and humor that King is known for. I don't know how he can capture the feeling of being young so well, considering his advanced years, but he seems to do it perfectly every time. The book was suspenseful and had that slow, creeping feeling to it that he's so good at delivering. I would definitely recommend this book.  For those that say it lacks development of characters, etc, I would just point out that it's a short story, not a novel, and as such you have to expect that things will not be fleshed out the same way that they would in a full length novel. It's a different style of writing and as such, requires a different approach to reading.
0375413405|3.0|OK.  I hate to cook, but loved the film.  What else can I say?  After looking through the detailed recipes at the forward of this book, Mastering the Art ...., I realized after a few pages of recipes, it was much too complicated for me. Actually, my husband does all the cooking around here.    When I was younger and had kids, I did most all the cooking, and everybody liked it.  I wasn't completely servant less when my kids were young, so I cooked recipes I got from my mom.  They were fine, most of the time. The rest I either made up or found in a cookbook.  I had a couple easy ones.  I can fry or boil an egg very easily without all the steps in the book, and they taste fine, I'm just not into steps.  I have several pots and pans, but only use a few.  This book is really for people who must just love to cook.  And I think Julia Child must have been really into it to write so much information. I can't imagine anyone going to that much trouble to write such an intricate book on cooking. But, I've written 3 books, and it was fun.  Two got published, the other one, I never bothered to send away.  Also I made a living as a musician and singer and therefore was much more interested in music, and writing music than in fancy food.    The life in France is so far a field from American life, I wondered how she managed to combine them, but she did, and she did it with food.  Good for her!

I also found myself curious about Bones gradsire Mencheres and of course I was excited for Spade to make an appearence in this sequel, all around it was a great read with some great action and love scencce, I highly recommend this whole series but as I said I think book 2 is my favorite.

0525950079|5.0|This book and the previous book, PILLAR OF THE EARTH, were two of the best books I've ever read.  It was hard to put either of them down.  I'm now a fan of Ken Follett.
0553386794|4.0|I read this on Kindle with no expectations - I had not read this author before but loved the genre so I figured I'd give it a try.  At first I was utterly lost and confused with all the foreign lands, places, and houses but as I read on it started to tie together into a great story.  It was sad in the way so many people got killed off for no real reason other than to add drama.  The main characters were described with such depth that it made you really get into their hearts and understand them as people which was refreshing considering a lot of books lately have been more about the action and less about the characters.  This book had both. I can't wait for the next book in the series!
B004J4WKTW|2.0|This book tells a good story if you read it in 3 days or less. If you drag it out, you will get bored. Borrow it from the library.   It is good for a quick weekend read. Not for a read a bit here and there for a month.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|It's a good job Captain Beefheart isn't planning to  release Trout Mask Replica this year, or the Velvet Underground White Light White Heat because they would be getting a lot of hasty reviews from people who are just plain bourgeois. 'Oh my God, this doesn't sound like I think I want it to' so it is a 'train wreck' etc. Actually it isn't, it's a great album. Half of it is heavy metal, and half is wierd Lou Reed stuff; the latter is probably the best he has done since the Velvet Underground in my opinion. I particularly like Junior Dad and Cheat on Me. If this record reminds me of anything it is some old blues or other, because it has that sort of intensity, roughness and authenticity. Give it a chance; it has a place, and it grows on you.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|This turntable by Ion is definately worth buying if you are currently building a vinyl collection, or just want something simple to play your LP's. It does not have pitch control or a weight control on the tone arm. It does however have the simplest setup in the entire world. Take it out of the box, plug in the RCA cables into your current sound system (it also can apparently be played through the computer speakers but I have not tried out the usb portion of the unit) and put a vinyl on. It has auto start/stop and simply works great. I had a very good Pioneer PL-4 unit before this but finding a cartridge none the less connecting the wires for it turned out to be a bigger pain than it was worth.   I bought this for about a hundred bucks at Staples, amazon had it for about 65 with free shipping. The sound on it was great, and the unit felt actually pretty sturdy (although the tone arm as expected is plastic and feels cheep). I waited a few weeks searching at thrift stores, flea markets, and garage sales for a turntable before buying this unit, and if you're anything like me, you've run into the same situations, missing needles, missing cartridges, messed up motors, etc. I have about 200 vinyls at this point and while I love them, I don't have the technical know how or the patience to research fixing a player or finding a replacement cartridge (although needs aren't that hard to find). I simply wanted something that would work, and if anything happened to it, have a company that was still around and could easily send a replacement part.  I can't comment on the USB portion as I have not tested it out, but as you can tell from the description, you can save your vinyls to mp3 easily. People underestimate this because in all honesty, alot of music simply isn't available on youtube or in mp3 form. This isn't just obscure artists, I mean big album tracks from people such as Ray Charles and Otis Redding.  In the end, I rate this a 7.5/10  Pros:   Very simply, user friendly setup  Usb connection to rip vinyls to mp3s  Comes with 45 adapter to play (duh) 45's  Built fairly sturdy  Cons:  No pitch control  No weighted tone arm  Tone arm in general has a cheap, light, plastic feeling  Super short RCA cables (get an extension)
B000JJRIP2|5.0|For fans of KISS, 2006's KISS Alive!  1975-2000 might be cause for overkill.  However, any true KISS fan knows that overkill is one thing that KISS knows how to do right so it should come as no surprise that this set was released.<br /><br />Included in this bulky fold-out box is the first three of KISS' original live albums (two of which include bonus material) plus a fourth live recording (dubbed the Millenium Concert).  If you're looking for the MTV Unplugged album that signaled the reunion of the original band members, you're out of look.  That set still hasn't been included in any shape or form outside of the CD and KISSology Three DVD set released in 1996.<br /><br />For the sake of brevity, I'll say that Alive! sounds better than ever in the remastered form included here, as does Alive II.  Alive III also sounds excellent, though I don't believe it was remastered for this release.<br /><br />Alive II comes with one bonus track, a rather stale radio edit of Rock And Roll All Nite.  Alive III features a live bonus cut of Take It Off, which comes from the studio album, Revenge.<br /><br />If you don't own any of KISS' first three live albums, this boxed set is a very convenient and easy-on-the-budget way to collect them all in one place.  If you do own them, then the only real reason to purchase this set if for the fourth disc, The Millenium Concert, which was recorded on New Year's Eve, 1999, in Vancouver, B.C.<br /><br />The Millenium Concert features all four original members of the band.  It features fan favorites such as Shout It Out Loud, Love Gun, Black Diamond, Beth, Lick It Up, Rock And Roll All Nite, and Firehouse.  In fact, all but three of the songs on this disc are available in their older live versions on the other discs in this boxed set.  The three in question include one classic,  Do You Love Me? (from the album Destroyer), and two songs off of the group's 1998 studio \\"reunion\\" album, Psycho Circus.  The songs are the album's title track and the Ace Frehley-fronted Into The Void.<br /><br />I gave this album five stars for the simple fact that it combines the group's first three live albums and their would-be fourth Alive! album in one convenient set (KISS Symphony:  Alive IV is officially recognized as the group's fourth live album, despite being released after MTV Unplugged).  I also gave it five stars due to the fact that Alive! is considered to be one of the greatest live recordings in music.<br /><br />If you don't own any of KISS' material, this is an excellent place to start.  Not only do you get to hear their legendary live performances, you also get to hear almost all of their greatest tracks.  Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys live music or wants to own a piece of music history.  This set will not let you downs album five stars for the simple fact that it combines the group's first three live albums and their would-be fourth Alive! album in one convenient set (KISS Symphony:  Alive IV is officially recognized as the group's fourth live album, despite being released after MTV Unplugged).  I also gave it five stars due to the fact that Alive! is considered to be one of the greatest live recordings in music.  If you don't own any of KISS' material, this is an excellent place to start.

B000255LIY|3.0|As per Wikepedia, \\"Henry II (5 March 1133 - 6 July 1189) ruled as King of England (1154-1189), Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Aquitaine, Duke of Gascony, Count of Nantes, Lord of Ireland and, at various times, controlled parts of Wales, Scotland and western France. Henry, the great-grandson of William the Conqueror, was the first of the House of Plantagenet to rule England....On 18 May 1152, at Poitiers, at the age of 19, Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine....Eleanor's prior marriage to Louis VII of France had been annulled only two months previously. Their relationship, always stormy, eventually disintegrated: after Eleanor encouraged her children to rebel against their father in 1173, Henry had her placed under house arrest, where she remained for fifteen years....Henry is a central character in the plays Becket by Jean Anouilh and The Lion in Winter by James Goldman. Peter O'Toole portrayed him in the film adaptations of both of these plays - [[ASIN:6300198731 Becket]] and The Lion in Winter (1968)....Patrick Stewart portrayed Henry in the 2003 television film adaptation of [[ASIN:B000255LIY The Lion in Winter]].\\"  As per the film review from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), [[ASIN:6300198731 Becket]] is \\"The 12th-century saga...of the deep friendship and later conflict between England's King Henry II...and his friend, Sir Thomas a Becket..., and how their days of drinking and womanizing came to an end when the monarch decided to appoint Becket archbishop of Canterbury. Much to Henry's surprise, Becket was transformed into a deeply spiritual man of God, who took his new responsibilities very seriously....The film charts how Becket went head-to-head with the king over the vigilante murder of an erring priest by one of Henry's knights. Henry's famous despairing cry, `Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?' -- leads to Becket's martyrdom in his cathedral.\\" Interestingly, the Catholic Encyclopedia suggests that Thomas' conversion was less dramatic, mentions nothing about Henry's famous line & indicates that his culpability for Thomas' murder is unclear. However, it indicates that Thomas strongly opposed Henry's effort \\"to bring clerics guilty of crimes under the jurisdiction of the secular courts.\\"   [[ASIN:B000255LIY The Lion in Winter]] deals with an older Henry and the infighting among his sons, his estranged wife, and himself over whom is to succeed Henry (NOTE: After a brief appearance as an early 20th century assassin in [[ASIN:0790729407 Michael Collins]], Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays a 12th century French king in [[ASIN:B000255LIY The Lion in Winter]], before becoming the 16 century [[ASIN:B000P12LWY Henry VIII]]!).
B005FVA3LK|4.0|'Achtung Baby' is still one of the best records to be released in the last 20 years, and certainly deserves a place on the upper end of the U2 lexicon. This box set serves as a great snapshot of who & what the band were at this pivotal time in their career.    I'll agree with the others here: the music sounds great; any remastering that was done here was not radical or re-defining, nor did it need to be.  'Achtung' and 'Zooropa' both sound like they've been punched up a notch (and that's about as techical as I'm going to get) with the bass end sounding heavier than before.  I do recall the original release of 'Zooropa' sounding a little flat, maybe that's just faulty memory.) I was glad to see 'Zooropa' included, as it is a great album, and it probably would never have happened without the immense success of 'Achtung'.    Also, agreeing with the others: most of the b-sides, remixes, etc. have been released before, however it's still good to have it all in one place now.    Standout parts of the box:    The new documentary 'From the Sky Down' is exceptional.  I wish there were a way to play back the newer renditions of the songs featured in their entirety (Edge sitting alone on a stage, with his guitar, singing \\"Love is Blindness\\") and after the doc was done, I wanted to see the U2 @ Glastonbury show!   The 'Kindergarten' disc is just great; similar to what you know, but with a few surprises.  In no way does it replace the classic album, but it does offer an interesting 'might have been' and an insight into the creative process.    The ZOO TV 'Documentary', personally I was glad to see it included.  What we saw in the States, prior to 'Zooropa' and MacPhisto, was a different version than what was captured on film in Sydney, and seeing some of that brought back some fond memories.    It's a good value to have the Syndney show in the box if you don't have it already, however it would also have been nice to see more of the American version of the 'Outside Broadcast.'  Overall, not a bad box set, I definitely do not regret my purchase.

B003Y5H57E|5.0|Due to the cast and the amazing fun feeling I got upon watching the trailer for the first time, I knew I had to see Crazy, Stupid, Love. I watched it and invited 4 of my friends over. We all enjoyed it and everyone had only good things to say about it.<br /><br />Crazy, Stupid, Love is basically as the title says. It is about many characters and family members who are in love or confused about their relationships. The story focuses on Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, who were high school sweethearts and have been married for 20 years. She quickly announces that she wants a divorce and Steve needs to start over again as he has never been without her. He meets and is guided by Ryan Gosling to have more confidence and attract women.<br /><br />There are a lot of huge laughs and some plot twists, which make for a very fun movie. If you are not a fan of any of the cast members, still give this movie a chance as many of them step out of their usual roles.<br /><br />The Blu-ray picture quality & audio quality are perfect for the film and very good.

0316066524|5.0|One word explains it best: mindf&#$.  The somewhat autobiographical, definitely bizarre, and extremely funny outpourings of a genius. The strings of the story sometimes appear to be hung in the air, attached to nothing, and yet when you step back you see how they interweave to form a work of true beauty, unparalleled in its time.  And while such a description might make the novel seem like some arrogant art piece, I felt so connected to the well-defined characters that even when the story took a back flip or a bizarre turn I was still hung up in its net.  Perhaps the greatest achievement of the novel is that it lingers with you.  For weeks after finishing I found myself thinking and wondering about the characters, projecting futures for them, and then flipping my new endings on their head to see how that would work.  Not light reading, you have to invest and dive in head first, but worth the effort.

B00006JMQG|4.0|I've read everybody else's review of the movie and can't add much more about that -- however, I would like to review the extra, GENUINE.  It says it's about a vampire, but if you think it refers to the blood-sucking kind, you'll be very disappointed.  Back when the film was made, \\"vampire\\" also meant what we'd call a \\"vamp\\" today:  a definite bad girl with a hypnotic power over men, used to ultimately destroy men.  When seeing this film, I recommend that you try to keep in mind that this was before the sound era and that the acting style which we'd nowadays consider campy was necessary back then to spell out for the audience what was supposed to be going on.<br /><br />GENUINE starts out as a high priestess of a (presumably) peaceful tribe which gets invaded and defeated by an obviously Arab tribe.  Mistreated after her capture, she ends up in a slave market beside a couple of downright lethargic women.  Then she attracts the attention of an elderly (presumably German) guy who gets warned that she's been made savage -- which she displays by biting the hand of the slave seller's henchman (the only scene of blood drawing in the entire short, by the way).  The old man, obviously attracted to crazed, savage women, purchases her on the spot, brings her back to his country and installs her in a secret chamber that would be perfectly at home in any Dr. Seuss cartoon.  She spends most of her time languid on the chaise(?) of her quarters.  But once a week, the old guy summons the town barber to maintain the hair he has left, and this gets the town talking so much that the barber has to be interrogated about it -- which, of course, means he has to get his son to sub for him with the old man.  The son, with the most ridiculous hairdo outside of a Coen brothers movie, quickly discovers GENUINE, which leads to murder, attempted murder, the arrival of the old man's grandson (GENUINE's next victim), another attempted murder, all of it culminating in the outraged townspeople storming the mansion to kill GENUINE, only to end in her dropping dead for reasons I still can't figure out.  But if you want an unintentional laugh, do see this extra.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was looking forward to purchasing the original Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi movies on Blu ray with some extras. Unfortunately, that isn't possible. I guess George Lucas doesn't like his original movies at all.   I remember watching Star Wars in the theater as an 8 year old back in the day when Lucas considered it \\"good enough\\" to release. Also, watching the sequels, collecting the toys,etc. Since then the versions have been updated with belching and farting noises among other things.  To me, the lamest thing is having Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars. (I know it was in the original book, but leaving him out makes more sense).  In the original version of the movie Obi-Wan explains, \\"You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.\\" Then when Greedo and Han have a conversation and Han shoots him it is because (as I understand it) Han knows he won't make it out of the Cantina alive otherwise. That's just the way things go on this planet. Obi-Wan didn't just make that statement to kill time.  We also see other not so nice things happening at the Cantina. In the updated version we find out that it's no big deal-Jabba just scolds Han for not paying him and Greedo dies for trying to fire his gun first. We no longer have the Han Solo in the wild west of outer space idea-protecting himself from what he knows will happen. In the updated version of the movie, I wonder why Obi-Wan's statement wasn't also updated as, \\"Hey there are some scummy looking people here who might say mean things to you so try not to cry.\\"    I'm not a fan of the \\"Menace\\" other than about 5 minutes of it, but the Clones and Sith movies have some good parts here and there with Yoda kicking ass being a favorite. I still don't understand why the acting seems so wooden from some people who have done well in other films. Now I guess Lucas wants to make the original movies even more like the inferior prequels by changing more stuff. He has already changed way too much. Thatmakes me very sad. Darth Vader used to be one of the great movie villains (and still is if you just watch the original versions of Star Wars, Empire and ROTJ). Now he is becoming an annoying person.   Anyway, I hope my VCR and VHS videos of the original movies hold up for a long time so I can watch the best versions.    I also hope that no one gets the idea to ruin a lot of my other favorite movies. I really don't want to see Julie Andrews belching out \\"The Hills Are Alive,\\" or random farting animals blocking Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dances.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|LOU REED HAS GONE WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE....ONCE BEFORE....MANY TIMES BEFORE.....HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED TO NOT FOLLOW TRENDS BUT TO CREATE THEM.  WITH LULU  and METALLICA....HE HAS SUCCEEDED ONCE AGAIN!
B003UMW68O|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie on Blu-ray. The picture quality was amazing. It has been a while since I saw this movie and watching this movie on Blu-ray felt like I was watching it for the first time. I felt like a kid again glued to this movie from start to finish. My kids enjoyed the movie on Blu-ray as well. I love that the picture fills up the whole screen on my widescreen tv. No more black bars on the top and bottom of the picture. I give this movie 2 thumbs up. You should buy it. It is worth the purchase.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|The absurdly vitriolic negative reviews of \\"Lulu\\" show just how pathetic popular music and its fans have become in the past decade.  Take this album for what it is: another wildly avant-garde (and, in my opinion, brilliant) Lou Reed album, with backing music by Metallica and occasional backing vocals by Hetfield (whose voice is used here as a perfect contrast to Reed's).  This is not, in any way, a traditional metal album -- nor is it intended to be.  The gullible idiots who preordered \\"Lulu\\" just because Metallica's name was on the cover have no one to blame but themselves.  If you're familiar with Lou Reed's work (particularly \\"Berlin\\"), you know what to expect, and that's exactly what you'll get.  I'm a fan of Reed's decidedly non-traditional singing style, and I think Metallica's instrumental contribution is exquisite (probably their best work since the Black Album).  If you can't handle a little experimentation, don't buy \\"Lulu\\"; just listen to \\"Enter Sandman\\" ad infinitum.
0439023521|5.0|Read this book in 2 days, couldn't put it down because even though the outcome of Kat's fate was predictable, how she was going to get there was not. I enjoyed the writing style, loved first person present tense! Made it all very captivating, I almost think if it were told from a different perspective like a narrative one that it would not have held my attention on the same level. My biggest issue with this book was that Katniss the main character had some very unlikable qualities. I realize all main characters don't have to be \\"great people\\" I just wasn't into her motives, even when we found her being compassionate with other characters you could tell it still was about her . This could be understandable considering the situation she was in but I like to see characters rise above their circumstances. I felt like the one truly good act Katniss did was in the very beginning when she selflessly took her sister's place but from there on out she seemed to be a very self centered character. I am looking forward to reading the other books and seeing if Katniss matures and grows to be the heroine she is set up to be in this first book!
1455510319|5.0|As the other reviewers have noted, this is the fourth novel by Michael Connelly featuring Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer.  This novel focuses on a criminal defense trial for a Haller client who is accused of murdering a bank employee.  The background story is the sordid and messy real estate foreclosure world of the last five years.  Haller begins representing the client when the foreclosure case is filed.  Later, when the murder occurs, he is her criminal defense lawyer.  The major point about this book is that Connelly really understands the criminal defense process.  The trial scenes make sense and you get the feeling of how the criminal system works, and sometimes goes awry.    Haller sounds and feels like a lawyer - he acts like a real lawyer and he tries hard for his clients, even when they may be guilty.  You could not have a better portrayal of a criminal defense lawyer and the crazy California justice system.  Lots of people try to write about the legal system - it is very difficult to make it feel right.  Connelly, who is not a lawyer, succeeds admirably.
0062011847|4.0|Among Beethoven aficionados there are two camps.  The first group are those who view and evaluate Beethoven's later works in the context of his deafness, for which they are easily considered feats of genius. The second group, an uncompromising bunch, considers them on an absolute basis. They view them as more flawed and occasionally discordant than his earlier works (which by the way, were not written by a deaf guy.)   I am in the first camp -- I have far too much love and respect for Pratchett and his Discworld not to acknowledge the truth about the author -- that he is unable to use the primary tool of his craft (ie. the keyboard) and is now forced to dictate his stories into a machine.  Snuff feels dictated, as simple as that.  Anyone who has ever tried to dictate knows that it is devilishly hard: sentences tend to run-on, and ideas tend to repeat themselves. These flaws are certainly evident in Snuff.  Those who argue here that Snuff feels \\"ghost written\\" are, in my opinion, off the mark. A ghost writer takes a series of facts and simplifies -- by constructing a single voice and a plausible narrative. Ghost written books, above all, feel consistent.  Snuff doesn't feel ghost written; and in fact, to me it doesn't feel written at all.  It feels spoken, authentically and inconsistently in Pratchett's own voice, and then edited and compiled with a (too) light and respectful hand.   It is amazing to me that anyone can write a novel under these circumstances, just as it is astonishing to me that deaf Beethoven could compose symphonies that sounded, well, symphonic.  If I were to rate SNUFF on the basis of a novel dictated by a person suffering from Alzheimer's, I'd not only rate it five stars, I'd rate it a full fledged act of genius.    Standing on its own, if you are the kind of reader who welcomes a return to Discworld and its characters-- with a predictable but serviceable plot that still moves along...then Snuff is a pleasing, 3-4 star holiday vacation with a few noticeable flaws.
0316056863|5.0|I cannot express enough how much I loved this book. There were many times I laughed so hard I was crying.   I passed on this book a couple of times because of the cover and title: I thought it'd be a feminist critic of a woman's struggle in the entertainment industry. A subject that has its time and its place, but not what I was in the mood for.  This book was not that. It was simply pure Tina Fey wit and humor.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I purchased Jurassic Park Trilogy on Blu-ray and I was so amazed at the picture quality. Widescreen feels up the entire screen of your tv. No more black bars at the top and bottom of the picture. I felt like I was watching a new movie all over again. The sound quality in 7.1 channel surround sound is amazing. If you have a nice home entertainment system with surround sound you will enjoy an amazing experience in watching this trilogy. I am so glad I purchased this on Blu-ray. I had the older dvd version back in 1999 and 2000 and there is a huge improvement in picture quality, sound, as well as the movie filling up the whole screen on your widescreen television. I highly recommend this for purchase or as a gift for fans of the Jurassic park trilogy.
0061989142|1.0|This book caught my eye when passing the bookshelf and I read it rapidly. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It does provide the list of basics for a woman's wardrobe such as the white button down shirt, the black skirt, the blazer, the pump, the black dress and classic jeans. It contains a few helpful hints as to how to organize one's closet. The bulk of the book seemed to be makeup, hair and accessories which was not really what I was looking for. I noticed that all the skirts and dresses were too short. The skinny jeans recommended are not good for most body types. Large chunky sweaters over skinny jeans are frankly not flattering on anyone. This book falls far short of what I think it was intended to be: a basic book on style. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00511PTWM|5.0|I love going on out-of-state road trips and, in the past few years, I have started avoiding interstate highways on those drives.  Over two or three days, this always adds a few hours to my drive but that's where the fun comes in because I love driving through and exploring small town America.  That does, however, make me very dependent on a GPS navigator and a good cell phone.  Unfortunately, there have been numerous times in the past when I have had to let my cell phone battery completely die because I could not take the chance of disconnecting my GPS device.<br /><br />This \\"Dual-Port Swivel Cigarette Lighter Adapter\\" has solved that problem.  Now I don't have to choose.<br /><br />The little gadget, although light in weight, is sturdily constructed and locks in cleanly to my \\"cigarette lighter\\" port.  It performs well and did not shake loose of either of the devices I have plugged into it despite the roughness of the roads I was travelling during the test.<br /><br />As much as anything, I love the price being charged by Amazon.  This is one of the very few electronic accessories I don't feel that the retailer is overcharging for...nice.
0060763280|5.0|Rather than review this book from scratch, I'm going to address two criticisms of it that are leveled at it commonly enough by other reviewers to conceivably dissuade potential readers from buying it.<br /><br />CRITICISM #1: LITTLE IN THE BOOK IS ORIGINAL<br /><br />This is true. But so what? This is the case for some of the best books out there. Why? Because there is a finite number of tried-and-true insights, perspectives, and techniques one can employ and adopt to improve one's life and profitability. Does this mean no one should bother writing books anymore? No. Why? Because what distinguishes one author from another in the success genre is not necessarily how unique their ideas are, but more often how well they manage to combine ideas borrowed from others and internalized well enough to lend themselves to their own distinct recipe for success conveyed through their books. Eker does a good job in this area. While he may not give enough credit to the giants in the field upon whose shoulders he stands, this doesn't reduce the impact these ideas have for the reader open to being educated and inspired by them, irrespective of who gets the credit for the ideas.<br /><br />CRITICISM #2: EKER SHAMELESSLY PROMOTES HIS SEMINARS THROUGHOUT THE BOOK<br /><br />This is both true and false. It's true that he promotes his seminars, but it's important to note that he only starts doing so most conspicuously and, one must admit, somewhat annoyingly in the later parts of his book, after one has already read what I consider to be the most profound, helpful sections of the book anyway. By that time we have already benefited enough from what Eker has written to induce us to give him some slack, to acknowledge that, while his constant reference to his seminars later in the book is somewhat shameless, one is more inclined to forgive him for his effrontery; at least he proves himself before doing so, leaving it to the reader to decide whether or not to attend his seminars. It's worth noting, however, that in these later portions of the book, not only does the seminar marketing begin to be piled on thick, but--and perhaps most objectionably--it's obvious that the material surrounding these pitches is secondary in importance for Eker than the pitches themselves.<br /><br />So, is the book worth buying? I think so. It contains several worthwhile insights with the potential to inspire one to achieve more than one might achieve without the benefit of this book and others like it. And so what if there are others like it? What matters is that whatever potentially life-changing ideas it contains are acknowledged, digested, and utilized by its readers, regardless of who might have come up with the ideas first. For example, when Eker emphasizes, at the beginning of the book, the importance of developing a &#34;money blueprint&#34; that promotes success, and more generally the fact that one's ability to succeed outwardly is a direct result of a correspondingly success-oriented inner relationship to money and what it represents, he echoes most if not all of the success authors who preceded him. Must one buy Eker's book as well? Perhaps &#34;must&#34; is too strong a word. Does it hurt? Certainly not. The key is to reinforce powerful ideas, and repetition is the most obvious way of doing so. After all, one of the qualities Eker champions in his book is the &#34;modeling&#34; of the worthy ideas of others. To chastise him for practicing what he preaches in this regard would be rather foolish, and, depending on the (in this case rather formidable) quality of what happens to be modeled, possibly detrimental to one's chances of ultimately succeeding.tions of the book, not only does the seminar marketing begin to be piled on thick, but--and perhaps most objectionably--it's obvious that the material surrounding these pitches is secondary in importance for Eker than the pitches themselves.

031606792X|1.0|This was one of the worst if not the worst book I have ever read.  I read the 3 prior books and found them interesting.  However, this is a real stinker... hence the Breaking Wind instead of the Breaking Dawn title.  Seems like the author was in a time crunch to get something down on paper.  Stupid ending.  I was never so glad to see the words \\"The End\\" as I was with this book.  I only made it all the way through because I was hoping it would get better.  However, that never happened.  Too bad for the missed potential.  I was hoping in a few years there would be a follow up book.  Kind of catching up the the family.  But, lets hope that never happens.  May they all rest in peace...so to speak.

Its good at refreshing some of the things I don't use very much and I learn the new components of the program it comes with a disk that has pictures and other things like lettering and photo repair its an ever growing industry that these books help me keep up with.
B0055S348W|5.0|Worked fine for me could not find either of the print drivers for my two printers but suggested a generic one for my Brother that works fine.  I think downloading the free version to test it out would be good idea.  If it works for your phone and printer then it is definitely worth the money.  I am not going to scrap my computer based printing fir this app but you can not beat the convenince.  Definitely has boot asked me for more money if you read the other reviews that is for remote printing.  HTC thunderbolt.
0062060554|4.0|I knew little about this book before I picked it up. I have to say that I love how Mr. Watson writes. He is able to capture the voice of a women speaker for the novel and do so interestingly. The diary set up of the novel worried me because I don't tend to like that set up in books unless it is done right. He did it right! The books' plot also moves at the perfect speed. If you pay attention to the details he provides throughout the plot you can really understand the book as the narrative reaches it arch. I enjoyed this read because the story makes you think about your own memories. Again the author's language use is right on par!

1423140591|5.0|Boy can this author create a cliffhanger. Seriously, its one those books you read the last page, turn it to expect more, and scream 'WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO ME!?!??!'. He simply ends books almost like you would end a chapter.<br /><br />My 14yr old got me hooked on the series, and we both love it. The author knows how to create a plot that is well thought out and works, for the young and old. There is some 'ok I knew that would happen' for the youth, but enough to keep me interested also.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I just like it.  Sure there are other ways to do the same/similar thing(s).  This program just makes it convenient.  Well worth the money.
B0020M99LC|5.0|As a rule I loathe many of the Bond movies because they're so cartoonish.  This one was quite different, more in line with the true character in Fleming's novels than a well-dressed clown spouting one-liners to negate the comedic violence.  I know the producers chose this direction because they wanted to distance themselves from the goofy Austin Powers films which were nothing more than a parody of earlier Bond films... which had already become parodies of themselves!<br /><br />God, how I hated that.<br /><br />You see, the James Bond novels played a very large part in my growth and desire to be a writer.  My father introduced me to them when I was twelve years old and I devoured them.  I'm very picky, therefore, about my Bond actors and the movies themselves.  This one did not disappoint me.<br /><br />The producers of Casino Royale also had the good sense to realize the actor playing James Bond is only as good as the villain he faces.  Le Chiffre was a sadistic bastard in the novel and he's played that way here, too.  And anyone who's ever read the novel will be gripping throughout the movie because they know what's coming later in the film. Again, Royale doesn't disappoint, nor with the love interest between Bond and Vesper, (Bond's first and really only love until me met Tracy) along with its inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />The novel itself is somewhat famous for its last line.  Mickey Spillane copied something like it for his Mike Hammer novel, I, the Jury.) The line appears here in the film, though not at the very end which lessens its impact.  It's still powerful, however, played against the backdrop of a crumbling building as metaphor for Bond's life.<br /><br />All in all, a very good film. Bond is back, thank God, in a reincarnation that would make Fleming proud.<br /><br />Go see it.

0316098329|3.0|Room was a different type of book.  While it was interesting; and certainly kept me reading until the end, it was not the type of book that I generally read.  It was a story of the life of a little boy(told from his viewpoint)and his mom held captive by a kidnapper.  I think the author did a good job relating to how the child viewed his world.  However, this book might have held my interest more if it had come from the mom's viewpoint.  I really cannot recommend this book, but if you do begin reading......please finish as I found the last half of the book to be more interesting than the beginning.

I also watch this show with my teenage kids.
B004WPYNY8|3.0|Too much screaming, guitar while constantly intense sounds the same from song to song. Very one dimensional.  The opening track has some wonderful moments, especially the 1st 2 minutes or so but the cheesy 'WE WILL FIGHT' lyrics are a bit embarassing to be honest.  Don't try playing this for the general public. Symph X needs to get back to their roots.
B0046MOV8U|4.0|I saw the I Am...World Tour. I was fortunate to get exceptional floor seats and Beyonce, the background singers, dancers and musicians are phenomenal. However, when I bought the DVD/Blue-ray, I was not expecting to watch documentaries throughout the entire concert. After watching several documentaries after a while, it was like, okay enough already - stop cutting parts of the performance to show documentaries! At the concert, from my memory, a great portion of the narratives that are in the DVD/Blue-ray were shown during the concert, but mostly while Beyonce and her dancers changed costumes, and I think a few may have been shown as a background during Beyonce's performance. Therefore, it was fine to view live, because the performance did not feel as if the documentaries were smothering the performance. I wanted to see at home what I saw at the concert. Bottom line - the documentary would have been better served as additional footage on the DVD/Blue-ray.   Still, Beyonce is my favorite entertainer and I have not had a favorite entertainer/group since the 80s and 90s Michael Jackson, Prince and U2. She puts on a great show. Beyonce voice is strong and beautiful, she sounds incredible and it's amazing that you can understand each word that she utters - no matter how fast she's singing. She also is an incredible dancer, stunning, seems to be sincere and spiritually grounded. I would have given this 5 stars but the docudrama during the concert was a bit overkill. Still, anyone who is a fan of Beyonce or is undecided about Beyonce would enjoy this concert. By the way, I think the Beyonce Experience concert DVD/Blue-ray ([[ASIN:B000WGZGNS The Beyoncé Experience - Live!]]) is better than the I Am...World Tour concert DVD/Blue-ray. The I Am...Yours at [[ASIN:B002RSDWHQ Beyonce: I Am... Yours - An Intimate Performance in the Encore Theater]] is pretty good too.

0307913147|5.0|Ready Player One, Ernest Cline's 2011 debut novel, is set in the grim future of 2044, where economic collapse and energy shortages make life unbearable. Or, at least, part of it is. In this dystopian future, most people spend their days connected to the OASIS, an online virtual world where people can forget their troubles and be whoever they want to be while exploring thousands of exotic planets. Several years before the story begins, James Halliday, the eccentric creator of the OASIS who was obsessed with the 1980's of his youth, dies, leaving behind a message that the first person to solve his cryptic riddles and find a hidden easter egg he's left in the OASIS would win his huge personal fortune and control of Halliday's company, Gregarious Simulation Systems.<br /><br />Our hero, Wade Watts - or, as he's known in the OASIS, Parzival (Percival was taken) - is an 18 year old who has only known misery in the real world, but has spent five years hunting Halliday's easter egg and mastering every bit of obscure '80's trivia he can find to try to solve Halliday's obscure clues. Parzival's friends Aech (mentor and best buddy), Art3mis (rival and love interest), Daito and Shoto (a pair from Japan working as a team) are also gunters (as the egg hunters are known), and become his friendly competition.<br /><br />The unfriendly competition comes from Innovative Online Industries, led by the ruthless Nolan Sorrento. IOI and their hordes of corporate lackeys known as Sixers are also looking for the egg, so that they can rule the OASIS and \\"monetize\\" it properly. Monthly fees, advertising everywhere, an end to the guaranteed anonymity of the OASIS - it would be an end to life as Wade's generation knows it, and IOI will stop at nothing to reach the egg first and make it a reality.<br /><br />The novel is filled to the brim with '80's references from film, television, video games, books, Dungeons & Dragons, and more, and anyone who grew up in that era will appreciate many of them. Cline does a great job of explaining them so that even if you don't have the trivia mastery Parzival does, you can keep up, and he makes it entertaining. I was born in 1978 (or, to put in Ready Player One terms, my first video game system was an Intellivision, but I spent way more time playing on the NES), while the fictional Halliday and the real Cline and Wheaton were all born in 1972, so there are a few references to the really early '80's I wasn't initially familiar with, but it didn't slow me down.<br /><br />As fun as the fantastic voyages into the OASIS are, Cline does a great job of keeping the action in the real world important and exciting. Parzival finding the hidden keys, leveling up, and getting epic gear are very well done and entertaining, but the heart of the book is Wade's story and his personal growth and the struggle to juggle his quest for the egg and the need to survive and make personal connections in the real world. Those were the parts that really made me think (as I sit here typing the review to post in the internet - yes, I'm aware of the irony).<br /><br />Actor, writer, and geek Wil Wheaton narrates the book, and he does a fantastic job. His characterization of Wade/Parzival and his friends and rivals really makes the story come alive. You can tell that Wheaton loves the material as much as Cline and Parzival, and experienced it himself as he perfectly renders all the movie quotes and classic video game sound effects of the era. Truly, I cannot think of another audiobook narrator who could nail the Pac-Man death bwoop like Wil does. This is one of those rare combinations of book and audio narrator that really adds another level of enjoyment to the experience.<br /><br />Ready Player One is one of the best books I've read this year, and it has definitely put Cline on my radar as an author to watch. The film rights have been sold and Cline (who is also a scriptwriter) is working on the script. I'd love to see Ready Player One on the big screen. In the meantime, I heartily recommend you read Ready Player One, and if you are an audio book fan, definitely listen to it and enjoy Wheaton's fantastic performance.<br /><br />The only thing that would have improved the book for me would be if Parzival was a descendent of Erdrick.Player One, and if you are an audio book fan, definitely listen to it and enjoy Wheaton's fantastic performance.  The only thing that would have improved the book for me would be if Parzival was a descendent of Erdrick.

Great album.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|I watched The Adjustment Bureau with my hubby last night and I quite enjoyed it. This movie is about a young American politician who meet Elise, an eccentric dancer and fells in love with her. Now this could be your typical two people from different creeds in society meet and fall inappropriately in love kind of story, and it is, except this movie bring a twist to the old and tried concept, the Adjustment Bureau. Now as it turns out there are these gentlemen in suits and hats that walk around making sure things go according to plan, and the plan say that our hero and Elise is not to be together. The Adjustment Bureau deals with free will versus destiny as well as introducing a very interesting take on God, angels and the nature of reality. The Adjustment Bureau is what you would get if The Matrix and Dark City sat down one night to watch The American President together but in the middle of the movie they decided to make love instead and had a baby.<br /><br />The Adjustment Bureau have a good story, it is well phased and have enough humor to make it delightful without ruining the serious tone of many of the scenes. By the end of it you really do cheer for David and Elise to get to stay together. The actors all do a great job and the music works well with the movie even if it is pretty forgettable. All in all The Adjustment Bureau is a good movie, here however I have one gripe with this flick, it seams like the creators of this movie decided to play it safe. The Adjustment Bureau is good, but it is not great, it do not take any chances. This could have been an amazing film, but as it is it is entertaining and fulfilling but like it's music it is forgettable.<br /><br />Another gripe I have with this movie is Elise. Now I know the director wanted her to be delightfully whimsical, but she is not she is at times just stupid. Ok so she is an adult woman who crashes a wedding just for fun? No reason for it, just fun, seams a bit childish to me, but fine the case workers (the men in hats) could have made her do that, but later when Elise meet David on the bus, and keep in mind they have known one another for five seconds here, she takes his new several hundred dollars work phone and put it in his cup of coffee! Who do that? Is it supposed to be cute? And if so who would find having their very expensive work phone destroyed on a whimsical whim by a woman they have just met? That bus scene really made it hard for me to suspend disbelief because it was just so stupid. I know it is just one scene and the rest of the movie is good, but when the heroine in a love story is presented as half insane, selfish and destructive in one of the first scenes where the main characters interact it get a bit difficult to take the relationship between the main characters serious later in the movie. In general The Adjustment Bureau had been a more powerful film if that F***** Blueberry had never ended up in a cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Adjustment Bureau is not perfect, not by a long stretch, it pay it safe and while it is never boring the movie is forgettable, it is one of those flicks that do not have any impact on you but when one of your friends mention it a while later you go, humm...ah...yes I think I have seen that, it was pretty good what I can remember, but other than that it will just fade from memory. I do however think The Adjustment Bureau is worth a watch, especially if you are a fan of movies like the Matrix or Dark City. I recommend this movie as a buy as a few months after you have seen it you will have completely forgotten about the movie and can then enjoy discovering the story all over again, it is a never ending bundle of joy that way, and now that I think about it, good but forgettable can actually be a winning combination on the home entertainment marked. :Pld have made her do that, but later when Elise meet David on the bus, and keep in mind they have known one another for five seconds here, she takes his new several hundred dollars work phone and put it in his cup of coffee! Who do that? Is it supposed to be cute? And if so who would find having their very expensive work phone destroyed on a whimsical whim by a woman they have just met?

B003YWUTKM|3.0|having been a fan and listener of both the orb and pink floyd since the 90's, i was extreemely excited about this release.  Ultimately it was a letdown.  It is somewhat cool and certainly not terrible, but there is nothing here that will make you play this CD over and over.  In fact, four listens was enough for me.  I havent bothered to listen again, and have also not found it necessary to include either of the tracks on any CD mixes.  The CD would probably be better if they separated each of the long tracks into 4 or 5 individual ones.  This would allow me to avoid the parts that to be honest basically suck.  It does have momentary glimpses of genius but the cool moments are diluted amongst way too much crap to allow a more favorable rating.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I am a huge retro video game fan, but I actually didn't see the original Tron movie until after I saw the sequel. This is the sequel and it does not suck. To specify, I have as of this writing seen the 1982 original and the sequel. I consider the two films equal to each other, due to the fact that they are good solid examples of the special effects of their respective time periods. As well as, they both are part of a highly intriguing story. If you are a gamer, like myself then SEE THESE MOVIES!!! The story mainly involves a man called Kevin Flynn who can transport himself to a digital world. The world is pretty much a video game brought to life, which he helps to put back in order. This sequel is the story of Sam Flynn, who goes to the digital world to rescue his father. The action sequences in Tron Legacy are really cool and the story presents no problems when tied to the events of the first Tron. The music is not the best thing about this movie, despite everything everybody thinks. If you have seen the first Tron, you're going to hate the end of Legacy, but the whole film is good except for that.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|\\"All men fear death. It's a natural fear that consumes us all,\\" says a character in \\"Midnight in Paris\\"... \\"However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears.\\"<br /><br />Paris is her name. She has seduced writers for centuries, and in \\"Midnight in Paris\\" writer/director Woody Allen makes love to her with his camera, in the most poetic of ways.<br /><br />Or perhaps he's referring to art, to achieving such intimacy with your craft and such artistic climax that you become immortal, like Hemingway, Matisse, Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dali, or Allen himself.<br /><br />Gil Pender, the protagonist in Allen's new film, has never experienced that kind of artistic height. Played quite convincingly by Owen Wilson (in a surprising and refreshing role that Allen had to re-write for him), Gil is an aspiring novelist who is visiting Paris with his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. But while they prefer to shop and visit museums, Gil chooses to wonder about. \\"No work of art can compare to a city,\\" he says.<br /><br />Pender is actually mesmerized by the City of Lights and fantasizes about what he believes was Paris' Golden Age, the 1920s with the Lost Generation of American writers walking its streets, writing in sidewalk caf&eacute;s, and frequenting smoky bars and flamboyant parties. One evening at midnight, trying to find his way back to the hotel, something magical happens to Gil. Really! But no reviewer should give that magic away.<br /><br />Getting lost in the city seems to be a symbol for how lost he really is, as a person and as a writer, and although he's somewhat insecure and anxious (he even carries a bottle of Valium with him), he's actually a likable guy and soon meets a few bohemian friends (played by Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, among others) who give him much-needed advice about life and the creative process.<br /><br />From the beginning, \\"Midnight in Paris\\" grabs you with its witty and sophisticated dialogue about art, culture and literature, and in the second half the dialogue gets even better. For instance, my favorite line comes from one of the bohemian characters, who believes that: \\"the job of the artist is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.\\"<br /><br />Another piece of wisdom comes from one of the antagonists who criticizes Gil for being infatuated with the past: \\"Nostalgia is denial...a flaw in the romantic imagination of people who find it difficult to cope with the present.\\" Think about that one while watching the film, for I believe, there lies the moral of this fabulous fable about the past and the present.<br /><br />At age 75--with more than 40 films under his belt--Allen has created a film that literally glows. Its dazzling cinematography, inventive plot, and Parisian score, combined with the top-notch acting and set-design, makes for an almost-perfect film, one that's not only clever and thought-provoking, but also entertaining and accessible--even to mainstream audiences.you with its witty and sophisticated dialogue about art, culture and literature, and in the second half the dialogue gets even better.

B0050CJNJ2|3.0|I bought this one together with ten other country albums on a recent trip to New York.  At the time there were a lot of noise about Lady Antebellum and this album and since I like contemporary country music it was natural to buy it. By the way, the others were the latest offerings from Toby Keith, Rodney Atkins, Trace Adkins, Vince Gill, Billy Ray Cyrus, Martina McBride, Ronnie Dunn, Steel Magnolia and Brad Paisley.  I have a principle that if I like an album I will rip it and put it into my iPod. This one did not make it. This is a very well produced album and there is nothing wrong with the music or the singing but one thing. The Music is boring! There is not a single tune that I remember after listening to the album. There is not a single tune than made me stop and listen, tap my foot or whatever. It all fades away as background. Well produced, not bad but boring. Probably if I was a native US citizen and listened to the text of the songs harder I might find some reason to change my view but that is not the case. This one goes into the pile of CD:s to be played in an unknown future when I have forgotten how it sounded the first time.
B003L77G06|5.0|I love this DVD - funniest show on TV.  Can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD
B005DHC6R0|5.0|For Americans who have not been paying attention to Noel Gallagher-related music (Oasis) since the heyday of the 1990s, now is a great time to listen again.  With this album, Noel Gallagher has delivered a heartfelt, well-produced pop-rock album, packed with great melodies and interesting music.  Most of the professional reviews of Noel Gallagher's first solo album spend too much time writing about the interesting backstory (and the whole Liam vs. Noel thing), which I find a bit unfortunate as it overshadows the great music here.    There's a variety of quality songs here, each reflecting Noel's melodic gifts.  A few of the songs go for the epic feel of classic Oasis tunes [Everybody's on the Run,(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine and Stop the Clocks], except with strings and choir instead of electric guitar.  On paper that sounds pretty silly, but it actually works, once you get used to it.  A few other songs have an interesting Kinks influence [The Death of You and Me, Dream On, Soldier Boys and Jesus Freaks]. There's even a good ballad, If I Had a Gun, and a good quasi-dance tune, AKA What a Life!  The music generally sounds something like a cross between The Importance of Being Idle, Falling Down and Part of the Queue from the last couple of Oasis albums.  I am not a big fan of horns, but the modest use of them on this album works nicely.   Noel's voice sounds great through-out.  I've always been partial to singers who actually write their own lyrics as they can often give the songs emotion and meaning that a more technically proficient singer might miss.  The tone of the album is generally uplifting with a large dose of  melancholy, reflecting Noel's vocal and lyrical style.  The lyrics, while sometimes not Noel's strongest point, are generally good here.  Even when the words are somewhat silly (as on Dream On), Noel's delivery, along with the music, make that silliness fun, not cringe-inducing.    Noel has even managed to leave a few of the more interesting songs off of the album - check out Let the Lord Shine a Light on Me, A Simple Game of Genius and Alone on the Rope on YouTube or elsewhere (such as the Deluxe version or Itunes version of the album).  In particular, Alone on the Rope is a classic that should be on the album somewhere.    Some may not be satisfied with this album because it does not \\"rock\\" or they might miss Liam's voice. True, there are only two guitar solos on the album, and the ending of Stop of the Clocks is about the only time the band cuts loose.  And while I like the production, I still enjoy the more stripped down demo version of Record Machine (again check Youtube) with its great baseline and more raw guitar solo.  Still, this album is the most consistent set of Gallagher-penned tunes since Oasis' commercial peak, What's the Story (Morning Glory), though it does not rise to the heights of that album.
0385534639|2.0|I went to the Night Circus and had a wonderful time. I went in the tents and experienced a world that was like no other.   But, I didn't meet anyone of interest, I don't know who they were, what they were doing or why. Too bad, it would have added  so much to the journey.
B00507ZQSO|4.0|Aida was an opera in which Verdi clearly planned large scale perfomances, not unlike the classic French operas of Meyerbeer.  It was supposed to premiere in Egypt itself, but complications caused that performance to be delayed several years.  Here, Franco Zefferelli, set designer and director, has put on a visually sumptuous staging at La Scala in Milan.  The sets are amazing, huge, colorful, well lit, etc.  Perhaps the best looking sets I have ever seen!  This is like the big Met Opera productions by him, so no surprise there.  Roberto Alagna was, as always, quite excellent, and all three major singers did a great job singing and acting.  But, you will want this for the massive sets and staging.  The sound was great.  Be sure to watch this on as large a screen as possible (mine is 55 inch hooked up to a big stereo system).  It looked and sounded great!

B005G02RIC|4.0|I have seen this opera several times, and own over 15 different dvd's of this as well.  So, in this one, what particularly moved me?  Taking in mind the huge setting in the Verona arena, I was surprised at how well this rather small scale opera worked in this vast space.  The arena sits 15,000 people, so VERY large productions like Aida, Nabucco, etc, work especially well.  Here, the ending of Act 1 (with the full church service) was spectacular, and looked even better on the Blu-Ray disc.  THIS is really what the Verona arena is for.  But the more intimate scenes of Act 2 still worked well for me, even with the large scale.    Marcello Alavarez was terrific as Carravadosi, and all three major roles were well sung and acted.  Finally, the video  was excellent, I thought the sound was terrific as well.  This opera is always a fun watch as it is so deliciously melodramatic.
B00007LTIG|5.0|I got this album (the original version) from my then pay pal Marsha Fewry from Portola Valley who - if I remember correctly - even knew Bob Weir personally, in the late 60s, when I lived in Berlin. We exchanged frequent letters and some albums. I also got \\"Live Dead\\" and the first two Paul Butterfield BB lps and the first one by Jefferson Airplane from her, and she also sent me posters from Winterland and the Avalon Ballroom and told me about the concerts she attended in these places.   I still have all these gems from a period when there was still a lot of hope that the youth culture might be able to help change the world towards a more consciousness and less money and military power supremacy oriented one.   Alas, it wasn't meant to be. Anyway, I'll always keep that time and the mind blowing psychedelic experiences in my heart, will never forget the three times I saw Jimi Hendrix live, and a lot of other great shows with beautiful music and people. And of course the mid 70s, when I traveled with very little money through Afghanistan, India, Nepal, etc. and met similarly minded people from all over the world there, especially Bruce Jones from Los Angeles whom I later visited on my way to Mexico. Too bad I lost contact with these great people. Hope you are doing fine!   Cheers to everybody out there who's still a keeper of the flame! Don't be discouraged, remember the holy moments of insight and wisdom you had and shared! And keep your friendship with the right people!  All the best!  Hans
B00000634J|5.0|This is some of John Lennon's very best music.....I had to have this CD after watching the documentary about him on TV titled \\"Imagine\\".  What an extremely brilliant composer/musician. I've formed a whole new respect for him and can only be sad thinking about the music that may have been written had he been allowed to live out his life. You simply must see the documentary - his love for people, peace & music was so misunderstood in the 60's along with his political views.. His life touched this world in a beautiful and long-lasting way. This CD is one of my favorites.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset for the purpose of replacing my Razer Carcharias Headset.  The range on this is ridiculous, I can pretty much use it anywhere in my house.  The sound quality is amazing!  The drivers and support are also equally impressive!  The battery life is long at 10hrs, but I wouldn't mind having a longer battery life.  The headset is EXTREMELY comfortable, it's almost as if it was made for my head.  I guess the only problem with this headset is that you can't use it with consoles. But I guess there's a flaw for everything.
030726999X|2.0|Frankly I did not read the first 2 books of this trilogy, so I started at a disadvantage.  But about 1/10 through the book there is a plot hole big enough to drive a Saab through.  You have two persons who probably have gone through a violent struggle.  They are both in the hospital.  You put them on the same floor down the hall from each other, with no police presence to guard either one or both of them?  I don't know how things are done in Sweden, but already this is unbelievable to me.  I am not going to read through this book.  Maybe I'll try the first one.
0393064476|5.0|This purports to be about the rediscovery of a lost work by Lucretius that helped to open the door to let in the fresh breezes of the Renaissance.  What it is really about is the fact that in the 1st century B.C. thinkers had come close to a real understanding of the way the world works without having to resort to propitiation of unseen deities.  As Flaubert remarked, \\"Just when the pagan gods had ceased to be, and Christianity had not yet arrived, there was a unique moment in history, between Cicero and Marcus Aurelius, when man stood alone.\\"  p. 71. Greenblatt is trying to ask the question of how it came to be through most of human history that \\"the tellers of fables possess[ed] a monopoly on the measure that humans ha[d] invented to express the pleasure and beauty of the world\\"?  p. 200.  The liberating thought of Lucretius is that \\"knowing the way things are\\" as opposed to knowing only the fictions that those in power invented and perpetuated, would actually \\"awaken the deepest wonder.\\"  What took this approach away from us for close to two millennia, as Greenblatt makes clear, was a medieval church kleptocracy that used the fear of an afterlife to enrich itself and the fear of a painful death to keep otherwise thinking minds within its control. Greenblatt's point here is virtually the same as Richard Dawkins' in his latest book, \\"The Magic of Reality\\": it's time for us to grow up, to get back to the Lucretian project of building a just and peaceful world without the interference of ideological fictions, but growing up does not mean we need to lose our sense of wonder.

1612930840|5.0|Northanger Abbey is Jane Austen's 5th published novel, although it was actually written before her earlier novels. Catherine Morland is an impressionable, innocent and naïve seventeen-year-old from the country, in Bath for the first time in her life. She is grateful to be befriended by the lovely Isabella Thorpe, but less than pleased to be pursued by Isabella's brother John. Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor appear to be more genuine in their friendship, and Catherine is invited to be a guest of their father, General Tilney, at Northanger Abbey. Catherine is an avid reader of novels, and, believing life to be an adventure, gets the wrong end of the stick on more than one occasion. Austen's style is a little different in this novel; she occasionally mentions, as the author, her readers, her characters and the plot. She has her characters make some quite strong statements about novels and novelists. Catherine's plight towards the end of the novel brings a lump to the throat, but much of the novel is filled with humour. Probably the funniest Austen.

B001E75QH0|5.0|The entire series was a fantastic escape into constant action fantasy. While I never expect believability in this genre of movies, the first three were as believable as possible ... an added plus. The fourth (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), while it did hold me to my seat, was a huge bit far fetched and somewhat disappointing. Overall, it remains worthwhile to get the whole collection, so you'll have something to share with your children or grandchildren. One day someone will screw up and do a remake, so it will be neat to show your progeny what great movies and great actors were really like.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All of the haters need to realize that when you were a kid or when you saw these for the first time you were doing one thing that you aren't doing now.... enjoying them. Drop the hate and maybe that feeling will come back. Enjoy them as you did the first time and you will be much happier.  Edit: I also want to add that there are a lot of parts I try to ignore (the new Jabba Palace song especially even though I didn't like the original that much either and of course Han and Greedo) but the Pros more than out weigh the Cons. Seeing the original trilogy in crisp HD and hearing the Millennium Falcon fly across my TV room is reason enough. There are way more original parts than changed parts. Purists have tunnel vision and these little parts are insignificant. For example if history were different and the originals had blinking Ewoks or a \\"Nooooo\\" at the end of Jedi and Lucas changed that to non blinking Ewoks and a silent Vader in the remakes people would be just as hysterical. Let's not overshadow the asteroid chase with Sebastian Shaw's eyebrows. Take the bad with the fantastic.
B000BEZPQE|2.0|Slipknot used to be THE metal band when I was in school. If you claimed to like hard rock and metal and you didn't like Slipknot, you didn't like metal...plain and simple. Fast forward a decade and Slipknot seems to be struggling to stay in the limelight, what with Cory focusing so much on his mainstream band Stone Sour, and the other members having side projects of their own.<br /><br />At the same time though, Slipknot is widely respected as a live band, as evidenced by their amazing DVD release Disasterpieces. Yet, as much of a fan as I still am, no matter what haters may say, I cannot stand here and tell you 9.0 Live is a GOOD live show...because it's not. I have only one thing to say...<br /><br />...Not even this strong of a setlist can cover up Cory's horrendous vocals.<br /><br />Slipknot used to be so awesome. From the crazy/groove based riffs to Cory's incredible screams, they were always a band I could listen to and enjoy. But now? Now Cory seems to care more about singing than giving us that anger that initially drew all of us in. And, sadly, the singing is what we get on 9.0 Live. Whether it's a song like Eeyore that was literally all screaming, or Purity, a song that is so emotionally intense, an intensity that DESERVES screaming. Instead we get watered down versions of classics from their first two--amazing--releases.<br /><br />Struggling.<br /><br />That's the one word that kept coming to mind throughout the duration of 9.0 Live. They struggle through every single song, no exceptions. I think its time we all stand up and remove the blinders and realize that Slipknot will never be what they used to be. They will never be that incredible live band they once were. The schtick is old and done, they have no new tricks up their sleeve. This is the CD where I wash my hands of Slipknot once and for all. The ONLY reason this got 2 stars was because of the setlist. Thats it.
0385534639|5.0|I've needed a book like this for a long time - a page turner, one I didn't want to put down, one I really didn't want to end. I bought into the circus from the beginning and I wanted to run away with it. It would be hard to explain the the story of this book, actually to do so would ruin, for subsequent readers, the ride on the carousel. The story resembles a lace doily - beautiful to behold without recognizing all the pieces of cotton that make up the individual threads of the story. This is a fantasy, a mystery, and multiple love stories. I was one of the lovers.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Not sure what people were looking for going into this movie, but what I was found was a fun ride.  Sure, there could have been more fight seens and all that, but what I experienced was a great start to I hope becomes an even greater sequel.  The writers and directors had to give an abbreviated back story due to I'm sure the restraints they had with the length of the movie.  Those who were fans of the comic probably had two opinions, give more, or they got it just right.  I hope hollywood makes another and I also hope that Ryan Renolds returns for the next film.  His wit, as well as Mark Strong (wish he had a greater role) made this an enterntaining film for me!!!
1451648537|5.0|This is one of the best biographies I've read.  Walter Isaacson has given us an honest, not-sugar-coated portrait of a man who was brilliant but also extremely complex and flawed.  My newly-found perspective of Jobs has left me wondering if he would have been as successful without the personality issues, or if he was successful in spite of them.  This was a terrific, thought-provoking book.
0307460444|1.0|I was really excited when I bought this book. I have been looking for a good cupcake book and I had already bought a few others that weren't that great and since this is a Martha book I thought there was no way this couldn't be great. Well I thought wrong, as some of the other reviewers have stated I have a feeling that she just stuck her name on this book and nobody actually tested any of these recipes. I have made 4 and so far all four have been terrible, I am not a beginner when it comes to baking and just like others I used top notch ingredients. The cakes are heavy and don't have much flavor at least not what you would expect from the titles, I agree that the quantities have to be wrong. But by far I am most disappointed with the butter-cream recipes, they are just a ton of greasy butter and lengthy to make. I thought it was strange that they called for so much butter and not enough sugar, I had to fix every single one of the recipes that I made. I would not recommend this book to anyone it is a huge waste of your time and money.
B0000B1OE7|4.0|I originally owned this on VHS, once upon a time when I was a young kid. It along with \\"Fist of the North Star\\", \\"Akira\\", \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" and \\"Street Fighter II\\" was my original introduction to anime and I have been hooked ever since. Out of these 5 CLASSICS that I was lucky enough to grow up with in the `80s, I have always been fondest of \\"Ninja Scroll\\", for its great story, pacing and characters with their cool and unique abilities. I have of course expanded my view to include many other styles and themes of anime, like the wonderful works of Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli. But, I always find myself wanting to go back and re-watch \\"Ninja Scroll\\" for the pure entertainment value, fantastic story line, and kicka$$ characters that have some great development through their smart action sequences.<br /><br />The true value of this classic anime might be lost on newer viewers, but as I was growing up I had always used this to introduce my friends to anime. It might not be my first choice of recommendation now, as there have been many other great animations I have seen since this was created, but many modern anime styles and story lines have come out of the study of classics like \\"Ninja Scroll\\", so I will continue to always at least recommend it as a must-see-film for anyone interested in anime and/or ninjas. You have to remember that when this first came out there was little development of computer animation and software to help draw or model and color animation cells like there is today, so watching anime like this can really help you appreciate the quality that was achieved before the advent of what is now \\"modern computer animation\\". The amount of raw talent that went into this film is spectacular. Its combination of great artwork and animation along with an imaginative story line loosely based on Japanese folk-lore/history still far exceeds the quality of many animations created today.<br /><br />Having finally exchanged all my old VHS players out for DVD players and still wanting to be able to break out this oldie-but-goodie, I found this 10th Anniversary Edition fit the bill nicely. I did deduct one star, as like many others have pointed out, the widescreen version does crop the top and bottom off the original to make it fit. But, that is not the version I usually watch. Plus, if they ever do come out with a proper transfer to widescreen then I will buy that version as well.<br /><br />What makes this 10th anniversary edition worth the purchase, besides being one of the best action/adventure ninja movies ever created, is the sound and overall picture quality. It is a two sided disc that includes both the original re-mastered full screen and the cropped widescreen, both in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 6.1. Also, the DVD quality with the auto-upscale that most DVD and Blu-Ray players have now, makes this version look way better then the old VHS, which I have played so many times now that it has a lot of hiccups throughout its play (^.^).<br /><br />If you can not stand watching video in full screen format, then unless you have watched this in its original format a hundred times like me, or especially if you have never seen it, you won't be able to tell that the widescreen is cropped anyways. Really, for a cropped video, the widescreen version is still a good transfer with good picture quality and I have watched that version many times as well, especially when I know others in the room are new to the film. There are a few scenes that look a bit pixilated in the widescreen, but overall it is not as terrible of a transfer as some other reviewers would have you think.<br /><br />If you are a true fan of anime then you have to own a copy of this. This is also a must have if you only own the older VHS version or for some ridiculously insane reason have never heard or seen \\"Ninja Scroll\\". If you have any interest in anime, especially anime that features bada$$ ninja action, then you owe it to yourself to buy a copy. Also, make sure to check out all these classics: \\"Akira\\", \\"Ghost in the Shell\\", \\"The Fist of the North Star\\", \\"Street Fighter II\\" along with \\"Ninja Scroll\\". If I were to include a classic anime series then I would also have to also recommend \\"Cowboy Bebop\\". I will stop there because if I really take the time to think about all the other ones I adore then this might end up being the longest review ever written on Amazon.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, \\"Ninja Scroll\\" is not as bloodthirsty and perverted as many of these other reviewers are trying to make it seem. Making this out to be some sort of rape-porn is like calling a movie with two short nude scenes a hardcore porno. These other reviewers singular focus on the short graphic scenes in this film is very narrow minded. Chalking the entire film up to be a bloody rape-porno is just utter non-sense and I suggest just ignoring these small minded fools.
B00005M989|5.0|This is a great collection of Prince hits. Not all of his hits are on this album but it is a good collection of songs anyway.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|The first book established characters, a world, and managed to have an interesting plot. A large part of that plot came to an end in book 3. I figured the fourth book would follow the first and establish new characters and have an interesting plot. It did neither.  Book four floundered along and I was only able to skim it and not read the entire book. This has happened to me before in another series, the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. Apparently, when an author meets with amazing success with a series, there is a strong urge to crank out lots of pages and not worry about keeping the readers interested. This author uses the same devices to crank out boring page after boring page, meaningless detail and frivolous trivia.  This series has definitely jumped the shark.
B005DR64QE|1.0|The need for a fix of \\"Cage Rage\\" is really the only reason to see this film that begs the question of how and why some movies are made (other than cashing a check).  Terrible reviews and hardly in theaters, but now on DVD and BD, this slick-looking but loud, abusive, shrill, one-note tale of a home invasion and a family's risky fight for survival was directed by Joel Schumacher and co-stars Nicole Kidman.  Not for all tastes, but the committed Cage fanatic will find things to entertain in addition to yet another hairdo.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is quite a good book.  Even though I have been a very big fan of Apple ever since they came out with OS X, there is so much to the man behind Apple that I did not know.  Very driven stories of perseverance and the purity of aesthetics, yet also filled with touching human emotion, of both good and bad.  Not only did I walk away with better insight into what I could make better in my life, it also served as fair warning of the damage one can do to one's own humanity towards others [especially family and friends], even when trying to better humanity itself.

B0059XTTSM|5.0|Looking for a cool, quirky little indie film that plays with notions of desperate sanity and ancient visionary gifts?  Don't miss writer/director Jeff Nichols' timely and disturbing meditation about the growing, apparent madness of Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon), a good, heartland American husband and father trying to cope with family issues - his six year old daughter is deaf and needs surgery - escalating financial problems and private, apocalyptic nightmares.<br /><br />There's a pervasive malevolence in this mostly quiet melodrama that becomes increasingly unsettling as the dreams become more frequent and vivid; so much so that they cause Curtis to secretly borrow money to build a new storm shelter in their yard.  When Curtis confides his horrifying night-visions to his loving wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) is not happy with this turn of events and recognizes that her husband may need professional help.  And then he loses his job.  But the dreams persist.<br /><br />Michael Shannon is astonishing as Curtis LaForche.  And Jessica Chastain shows her growing bewilderment, anger and anxiety in her yes and body language even when there are no spoken words.  Shannon and Chastain are exceptional as the concerned couple.  There's never a false moment.  The special effects are organic and extremely effective.<br /><br />This amazingly well-crafted story and film taps into our collective concerns about our fragile, shared reality.  Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski mastered this particular filmic sense of shaping and focusing a feeling of nameless dread into an ever-sharper series of events that go further than our fears.  Movies are dreams made real, and like INCEPTION, this one delivers a layered drama of fractured reality and madness actualized.  Are we what we secretly perceive? Or fear? Perhaps.<br /><br />Here's simply the best drama of the year so far (as of this writing 1 November 2011).

Including a chord library that you can play to make sure it sounds right. This is PERFECT for me, since it tells me how to play all the chords!

B005NQ94KS|2.0|As someone who counts Stanley Donen's [[ASIN:B000AP04MO Two for the Road]] as one of his all-time favorite films, I was hoping this 2011 romantic drama might transcend its time-spanning gimmick of using one day every year - July 15 - as the touchstone for a couple who appear destined for happiness together but not without a lot of emotional curveballs and unforeseen detours. It doesn't. In fact, the film's structural conceit heightens the contrivances that keep the viewer from fully investing in the fate of what the filmmakers would like us to believe are soul mates. It's really impossible to calibrate why this mismatched pair continues to connect over the years other than to fulfill the cardboard dimensions of David Nicholls' verbose screenplay, which is in turn based on his [[ASIN:B0036S4CTS 2009 book]].  The lugubrious result makes for particularly disappointing cinema given that the film was directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig, who helmed Carey Mulligan's star-making turn in the far more satisfying [[ASIN:B002ONC9NC An Education]] (2009).<br /><br />The story begins on the night of July 15, 1988 when recent Edinburgh University graduates Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew end up spending the night together. She comes from a working-class background and is consequently smart and caustic but insecure as evidenced by the pair of granny glasses she constantly wears. He comes from money and has the cocky manner befitting someone whose shallow aim in life is to become famous since he's already rich. They connect for no apparent reason from the outset and start a friendship that borders on codependency. We see them every year thereafter on the same day as they grow from young adulthood to early middle age. Emma stumbles out of the gate becoming increasingly depressed working at a Mexican restaurant in London. Dexter finds fame as the sleazy host of a VH1-type entertainment-lite program. She eventually finds her footing as a writer, while he goes through a drug-induced tailspin. Their up-and-down lives intertwine at defining moments when something decisive happens to one, and the other has to cope with whatever the new situation is. The film repeats this pattern so often that it becomes redundant and tiresome even when an inevitable plot device occurs late in the story.<br /><br />I can see why an actress as engaging as Anne Hathaway would be drawn to a part like Emma because she gets to play a wide range of shades and emotions in her character's arc, but there are two things that are off-kilter about her performance. First, her pinched English accent sounds entirely too close to her take-off of Mary Poppins from her guest appearance on [[ASIN:B004DH7XI8 Saturday Night Live]] to be believable. Second, her naturally vibrant presence doesn't lend credibility to the early scenes when she appears to be doing a cheeky throwback to the first [[ASIN:B00006L948 Princess Diaries]] movie. She also makes co-star Jim Sturgess (Jude in [[ASIN:B002G1K82Q Across the Universe]]) look all the more pallid as the pitiable Dexter. He seems to be channeling Hugh Grant in order to evoke the charm necessary to attract Emma, but he suffers even more from the story's thumbnail-sketch approach. As Emma's failed love interest Ian, Rafe Spall is convincingly annoying as an aspiring stand-up comic without any talent, while Romola Garai has the thankless role of Dexter's humorless lover-turned-wife. Both appear to be playing stock characters for the sake of the central love story. At least Patricia Clarkson lends her requisite &eacute;lan as Dexter's worldly mother, but her scenes are all too brief. Despite a clever time-shifting scene at Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, the film left me dry-eyed wanting to see [[ASIN:B000AP04MO Two for the Road]] again..

B0055SWM08|4.0|Really fun game with calm, peaceful music.  Enjoyable during the evenings with family. The scenery is absolutely superb! I would recommend it.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|When I first started reading this book I thought I was going to have a really tough time finishing it.  I wasn't sure I liked the form of the open letter to Tess to tell the story, but I persevered and within a few chapters I was turning pages quicker than I could read them!  I thought that the end was inspired and it completely took me by surprise!  Not what I was expecting at all.  Both the characters of Tess and Beatrice were well written and they developed well throughout the book.  I didn't understand the Polish girls' character (cannot for the life of me remember her name; read the book a few weeks ago) at first, or why she was important.  But it all fell into place nicely and she really added to the whole story.  All-in-all a very entertaining, gripping, page-turning read.

0446693804|3.0|So I'll just start out by saying that my review is somewhat influenced by the movie.  By this I mean, I saw the movie before I read the book.  I'll try to avoid comparing the two, but I will say that this is one of the few books that I liked the movie better than.    This is a classic love story.  Landon: Not a bad boy, but not a good one either.  He lives life because it's what he was allotted and he goes to school because he has too.  He's never really had to much depth to his personality and he has little perspective.  He cares about himself and occasionally his family.  But that's about it for him.    Jamie: She's the daughter of the priest, and if that wasn't obvious enough, her father lets the world know.  She lives every day to the fullest and as if it is the last.  School and helping others is her passion.  She is faithful and whenever presented with the chance, she helps people in any way she can.      The two have known each other for years, but they have hardly interacted.  It is chance when their paths cross and when they do, their lives are both changed drastically.  True, it's Landon's life that alters the most.  It isn't too long before the two fall in love thus major differences in personalities.      I liked it.  The book was an okay read.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.  One of the major set backs for me was the lack of depth.  There wasn't any.  As far as realistic emotions went, it was like wading through a shallow pool.  When there emotions that were realistic and relate-able, they weren't elaborated on.  Another set back for me was that the book was mundane.  Of course, I love a nice simple romance.  One that could happen to any of us.  But the way this one was written almost put me to sleep.  I loved the characters, every one of them, but they didn't interact well.    This is one of those books that you either like or don't.  Or love or hate.  I think it totally depends on the person.  Hope this helps.

1451648537|5.0|I finally got a copy, which was a bit difficult in Central Europe and only able to read English.  If I read French, I could have gotten it in Belgium earlier.  I bought it Friday, and just finished it, late Monday night.  It's one of a select list of books where once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  The quality of the writing is excellent.  It does a great job of interweaving different points of view, shows Steve's faults, and takes a few great, probably slightly unfair, swipes at his enemies.  It was nice seeing some grace in his last few interactions with Bill Gates.  I did want to defend Bill in one sense that's overlooked throughout the entire book:  Bill Gates did put out a closed system and did exceptionally well.  What is it?  The XBOX.  The only Apple product I will likely never buy is Apple TV because with the XBOX360, I have my media center.  With Twonky Media Server running on my iMac and MacBookPro, I can still see/hear all of my Mac-centric media on my Microsoft XBOX360.  In the mid 90's if you hinted anyone outside of Nintendo would dominate consoles, and it might be Microsoft, people would have laughed.  So I wish someone had pointed this out to Steve for comment, or at least give Bill a little bit of credit, since it seems Bill just takes this on the chin.  Back to Steve. I've owned stock in Apple since I was a teenager, which was in the 80s.  I always had faith in his company.  As a leader both in a military and civilian company capacity, I've always looked for ethical, inspirational role models.  Although I don't agree with how he treated people, I do like how the book clearly defined his litmus for developing great ideas.  I think no matter your walk in life, these are important lessons, and the book clearly presents how he fostered a team which created great ideas.  I could go on, but I'd just be restating what's in the book.  Stop reading reviews.  Buy the book.  Then, give it to someone else to read...

B001UV4XI8|4.0|Update 12/26/2011: Woo hoo!  Thanks to the reply by Gundamfan0079, I successfully downloaded the digital copy.  Evidently the codes for this release have been reactivated.  Thank you for listening to our complaints, WB!  I changed the rating to 4 stars.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Ridiculous!  I purchased this combo pack yesterday because I also wanted a digital copy for my iPad.  I was shocked to discover that the digital copy expired on September 13th.  I contacted WB's customer service and this was their reply:  --------------------------  Hello,    We have researched your issue and this Digital Copy offer has expired. The Digital Copy offer is intended to be available only for a limited time following the initial release of the DVD and/or Blu-ray Disc. The expiration date is specifically stated on (a) the outside packaging of your DVD or Blu-ray disc, (b) the insert, (c) the Digital Copy disc, and/or (d) the redemption site.  --------------------------  I'm fairly incensed by this lack of \\"caring\\" by WB.  In essence, this is gross misrepresentation by WB and its retailers to continue to sell the combo pack when part of the \\"combo\\" no longer works.  It should have been re-labeled or pulled from the shelves on September 13th.  Expecting customers to notice the fine print is absolutely asinine...especially for people who have purchased theirs online.  Amazon.com customers are none the wiser unless they scour the reviews.  Restrictions and policies such as this serve no other purpose than to encourage illegal copies.  Not that it matters in the scheme of things, but my opinion of Warner Bros. has dimmed today.  I will vote with my wallet whenever WB is concerned.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|One of the best martial arts films I've seen in a long time. Donnie Yen is awesome, and the character he plays is as well. Lots of great fighting that is atypical of most films. Wing Chun is a fabulous art, and I feel privileged to see it in action. Yen is phenomenal, and the supporting cast is very good as well.
B004L49K20|5.0|For many fans, Duran Duran never went anywhere, and I'm one of those fans. However, when AYNIN was released the excitement behind it was unmistakable, the band was back with a sound they knew us fans would love and ya know what? They were right! This album has been out what, a year now? The single has been at least...and I listen to it constantly still...AND I NEVER FF THROUGH ANY OF THE SONGS! I cannot think of the last time I listened to an album so much and didn't ff through or past a song! AYNIN is jam packed with pure Duran Duran grooves, the sound reminds the listener of earlier material without sounding dated. It's basically the album all Duranies have been waiting for whilst listening to years and years and years of excellent Duran music we loved! Ok that made more sense in my head but I bet Duranies understand what I mean!
B000063147|5.0|It's Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, what more do you need to know? Just one example of their musical mastery, even before their legendary five members finally came together to form the godly brilliance that would go on to create Waking the Fallen, City of Evil and the Avenged Sevenfold self-titled album (and Nightmare, to some extent). Highlights, for me, include We Come Out At Night, Darkness Surrounding and The Art of Subconscious Illusion. This album is also the only time we are graced by Valary DiBenedetto's spine-tingling scream vocals. This album started it. You are not a true Avenged Sevenfold fan if you do not possess this album. Buy it, listen to it and love it!
B005RAO0GS|3.0|I really must agree with B. Steele and D's reviews. Owning the Lungs, and Lungs B-Sides albums, I was exstatic when I saw the Florence had another cd out. I purchased it thinking that, like the other cds, I would be burning through the tracks as hungriliy as I have done since they came out. I have listened to Ceremonials once and am totally disgusted in the outcome. I feel there is a very monotoneness in the song choice, which makes all the tracks blend together instead of standing out like in her Lungs cd.  I also feel there were too many instrumentals and back up singers in most all of the songs.  It doesn't sound like Florences usual rich tones.  Perhaps my feelings will change in time, but I am so sorely dissappointed in my purchase and do not feel the need to play any of these songs again.
B004DMIIVO|2.0|My kids ages 10 and 12 love movies by hayao Miyazaki, \\"howl's  moving castle\\" etc.  So I thought this might be a good fit for them.

B001HN6922|4.0|While we were disappointed that Radiator Springs was barely in this movie, we had read enough reviews to not be shocked at the total change in Cars 2.  The first Cars is one of our favorite movies.  The children love it.  Cars 2 was different.  It wasn't as good, nor as almost-tear-jerking as the first one.  It was a bit more...shallow.  Seems like the characters didn't have much depth, but it's still greatly entertaining.  I'm not really understanding the one and two-star ratings here.  But I also know a LOT of people were disappointed.  At least there are a couple of appearances by Sally and the rest in Radiator Springs and elsewhere in the movie (minus Doc, of course).
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I got into Avenged Sevenfold late, I will admit, but I did take the time to really listen to their previous albums and to hear how they have progressed throughout the years. Each new album was a massive step forward in their growth and progression, each one more brilliant than the last by lightyears. Though, to me, even though Waking the Fallen and City of Evil are their two greatest albums to date, Nightmare stands out as something truly and undeniably special, and not just because of the loss of their drummer, Jimmy \\"the Rev\\" Sullivan. What we find here are songs that feel influenced by grief, anger and acceptance. The opening title track is one of the most memorable on the entire album, for its force and its passion. It sweeps us up and away into the start of a train ride into sorrow and fear, followed by the chugging Welcome to the Family, the first step into the meat of the album, so to speak. Danger Line is . . just breathtaking. It's a track I have gone back to over and over again, for its building power and ending jolt that simply blew me away. Buried Alive, Natural Born Killer and So Far Away don't even try to let up on the emotional roller coaster started by the opening trio, and we're swept deeper into a growing nightmare (no pun intended) so tremendous we cannot even begin to grasp the whole of its enormity. And then comes God Hates Us. This track is a climax of outrage; an onslaught of screaming, burning fury so white-hot it will rock you to your very core. This track says, plain and simple: do NOT tick off Avenged Sevenfold! Words that should be heeded, after hearing this monster. For a short moment we're given reprieve for the start of Victim, but that is not to last, and we are quickly ripped back into the deepest pools of sorrow and confusion that will envelop you in its jaw-dropping beauty. Tonight The World Dies is a bit of a relaxing number, letting us recover from the endless barrage that drains you of your emotional integrity. After being smashed time and time again into a wall of hurt and anger, this song is a well-needed rest, and is a wonderful number all its own. And then we hear Fiction. This song is absolutely heartbreaking, as if a friend from beyond the grave was calling out to those they left behind, trying to explain why they left, and asking their loved ones not to grieve and to understand. This is probably the most heart wrenching song on the entire album, but it only sets us up for the next, and final track. We are brought into Save Me slowly, but with the feeling of impending doom as the grinding bass pulls us along into the deepest well of turmoil, yet. If Victim had you reeling, then Save Me will obliterate you. This track is an epic, and the perfect closer. Here we seem to have all of the muddled emotion of the entire album compiled into one ultimate final assault of sadness, anger and confusion leading out into purest acceptance of tragedy. This is, in essence, a deconstruction of the album as a whole, with all of the complexity and emotional burden collapsing in on you before resolving itself entirely. Though this is not actually a concept album, it does feel and flow as one, and is one of the most memorable albums I have ever heard for all the reasons listed above.

0761129235|5.0|Read it once, read it again. An easy to read book on how to take the steps that are small enough and yet powerful enough to assist you on the road to attaining your goals. It makes so much sense. Taking small steps the Kaizen Way is an easy, acceptable way to arrive at your destination. Often times, books of this calibre call for giant leaps that incur an 'it's too hard' mindset. Taking steps the Kaizen Way is an easy alternative that reaps the same results. It is a must read for those who want to improve their life.

B004R0YHI0|5.0|Whether someone likes or dislikes this movie seems to run along the lines of political ideology.  I would venture a guess that many of the bad reviews for this movie here on Amazon.com are from people who thought George W. Bush was a wonderful president.<br /><br />For me, a good movie is one that causes time to go by quickly and that is what happened for me with this movie.  It is likely that you either believe the U.S. was justified in attacking Iraq, you believe the U.S. attacked Iraq without justification, or perhaps you have no opinion on the subject.  If you believe the Bush Administration was truthful with the evidence they presented to justify invading Iraq, you should probably skip this movie.

0061997811|5.0|I actually purchased [[ASIN:0062101897 Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey]] before deciding to purchase this as well. The reason was that I did not realize this title was published (for some reason it slipped my HP radar), and it was only after I had perused the delights of page to screen that I realized this title was available as well. Initially, I wasn't sure how this would compare to Page to Screen since that is quite a hefty volume devoted to almost every conceivable detail regarding the HP movie franchise. The deciding factor for me was the fact that Film Wizardry also contained many inserts, pull-out books, pamphlets etc. that make for an interactive and engaging reading experience.<br /><br />I'd say both books are complementary. While Page to Screen provides more details on the movie-making process and covers just about everything (I say just about as there are some things not covered), Film Wizardry provides more of an overview with many fun elements thrown in for devoted fans such as the various foldouts and inserts. For example, in HP Film Wizardry, readers will get a chance to peruse a copy of the Marauder's Map, Harry's acceptance letter to Hogwarts, a catalogue from Borgin and Burke's, stickers in the Advanced Potion-Making pamphlet, two boxes of treats (sans the treats) from Honeydukes of Hogsmeade (you can tear them out and fold them into actual treat boxes, not that I would!), a Quidditch World Cup Programme, a copy of the Yule Ball Programme, Educational Decree No. 29, a product catalogue of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, and a Ministry of Magic ID card. Such goodies are not to be found in Page to Screen, so I'd definitely recommend getting both books.<br /><br />Since I've had both books, I've been reading both in tandem, and comparing notes. It is such a wonderful, rewarding experience to read all the details that went into making the HP movies. After visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter last fall (I'd recommend that experience for all Potter fans, at least once), I've been missing that wonderful experience, but these two books certainly make up for it as I can relive the world of the HP movies anytime I feel like it!Potter fans, at least once), I've been missing that wonderful experience, but these two books certainly make up for it as I can relive the world of the HP movies anytime I feel like it!
B004I3U7US|4.0|A compelling original with many references to the past that sound instantly familiar but that I can't name.  Hard to pin down.  Post-punk New York and spaghetti Westerns appear repeatedly.  A minimalist twanging Western guitar repeatedly suggests Television without offering any of their skill or much of their lyricism.  A sense of edgy, noir confusion, contradictions, and emotional chaos prevail.  She repeatedly swells to the edge of a major anthem, only to retreat.  The tension is compelling, but frustrating.  I feel a big heart in a scary place, navigating her way, with powerful aspirations but self-protective caution, through grit and threat. The strongest tracks are labeled \\"S\\" below.    1. Rider to the sea.  Brief twangs of a Western guitar from a foreboding, noir spaghetti Western spaced out in a hyper-spare setting.  The building chorus in the closing suggests the looming climax of such a movie.  2. No more words (S). Quietly, steadily chugging--1-2-1-2-1-2. \\"Oh my love\\" is chanted over and over by a yearning female voice somehow cut loose.  Behind, the Western twanger, now vaguely Television-like--leads a setting that boils up steadily into rasping rock in the space between verses.  Repeat.  3. Desire (S--best of CD).  Something close to bagpipes, backed by smacking drums and flourishing guitars, frames an urgent, powerful female voice very close to Patti Smith's.  Time is suspended as the verses build tension, which is finally released in a big anthemic classic rock chorus somewhere between Smith and Springsteen.  Somehow big and quietly steady at the same time.  Is it better suited to protective granite security or the flashing thunder of stadium music?  4. Suzanne and I.  Big New York rock, at once grand, noir, emotional, and held close.  Her dark, resonant voice nears being lyrical.  Big beat; spare, wanging Television-like guitar; leaps between big and small.  Hints of k. d. lang.  5. First we kiss.  Odd punky take on a Brazilian-informed nightclub popsong suddenly blooms into a near-perfect k. d. lang sound-alike in the big-boned choruses.  Back and forth, with a crowded, almost cinematic bridge.  6. The devil.  Spare, lyrical guitar opens, then slides into twanging.  Stop.  Her voice slides in along side the guitar in long, twining, gutterally uttered lines.  Lyrical guitar and deep, sliding voice unwind in long, spare lines.  Here and there, they swoon incautiously near the outer envelope of safety in slow, ¾ time.  They work toward a dramatic, noir finish that could backstop a scene with a dead-empty desert and big sky in a Spaghetti western--\\"The devil! The devil! The devil!\\"  7. Blackout.  Steadily driving anthem in a spare setting that fills a big space.  Bits of disco, U2, classic rock.  Her voice slides seamlessly from intimate to soaring and back over a closely controlled, energetic big New York setting.    8. I'll be your man  S).  Slick, clipped, Drifters-Latin syncopation drives quietly and steadily.  The twanging guitar laces the space above.  She enters with an urgent, small sultry, voice and builds to anthemic fullness--\\"I'll be your man\\"--then collapses.  Repeat.  She draws on voices and styles I know, but cannot place.  9. Morning light.  Opening phrases feel portentous, pointing to a big, swelling pop song in the offing.  But her voice works quietly and urgently in a spare, New York post-punk setting.  Everything is played down, as though all are whispering.  Sounds are dark and ghostly until they finally build briefly to a swell before collapsing.  10. Love won't be leaving.  Chugging beat of a heart beat.  Quiet, before a crashing wave of guitar turbulence.  Then her gray/gritty New York voice slides in.  The potential for an anthem remains unrealized, confined in a sooty, hazy, tight place.  All is edgy, uncertain, noir--pumped, but pinned.  Her voice seems to struggle from her body, finally opening full lyrical power on the choruses.  The choruses light up Western skies with dramatic emphasis; the action on the ground remains deadly.

B0059IVV9M|4.0|The settings feel synthesized from modular instrumental parts in a rickety way that is endearing, each a little different.  Think a village or Salvation Army band playing the arrangements of a quirky experimenter.  Some settings are quite complex and intricate, unfolding carefully through a song.  Vocals are uniformly warm, mellow, and welcoming.  Tim Buckley meets Rufus Wainwright.  The lead singer sounds old-fashioned, crooning in tawny tones, but always with a cool edge that keeps us in the 2010s.  Tension builds among the rickety settings, warm vocals, and power pop temper of the whole undertaking.  Fun, quietly content in a warm, comfortable way that is always a bit askew.  Haven't chosen favorites yet; all tracks are strong.  1. A candle's fire.  Lonely, quiet field organ, then full brass fanfare.  Steady, sturdy, earnest mid-tempo pop.  Warm lead male vocal practically glows a low, tawny gold.  Each bit stands carefully apart, but each is clearly part of an intricate design--will it hold together or stumble into a pile?  Fun watching.    2. Santa Fe.  Perky power pop straight from c. 1980.  Up-tempo pepperminty pulse.  Languid vocal lines flowing behind.  Hyper-bright trumpets joined later by a rickety carnival organ sampled in above over bridges.  Engaging tensions.  3. East Harlem.  Wah-wahing field organ opens.  Warm, mellow, languid vocal pop unfolds, tempered by shiny sampled brass and a pulse sprinkled along like a long, mid-tempo picket fence in keyboards.  4. Goshen.  Warm simple keyboard paired with warmly crooning vocals in a calm comfort song, a warm memory or reverie.  All quiet and meditative.  And then the tacky trumpets.  And earnest snare drums.  Wonderful!  5. Payne's Bay.  Squealing synthesized fiddles--or is it a field organ?  A gently rolling pop song from the early 1960s (like Burt Bacharach?) emerges.  Now the synthesizer is pumping trumpets and other brass in a steady Salvation Army march tempo with metrically splashing cymbals.  The marchers chant \\"Head strong\\" on and on.  6. The rip tide.  Quietly epic portrait of a lonely, windswept beach with cliffs shedding shattered shale close ashore.  In brass and piano.  Then piano+vocal.  Quiet, steady, and reassuring, but laced with reserved melancholy.  Brass returns.  On and on. The song turns slowly on long, long cycles like the tide.  7. Vagabond.  Quietly perky piano, then brass, in light syncopation, brings Herb Alpert to mind.  As the setting cha-chas along, the warm, soothing vocal enters in slow lines.  Brass takes up the calm lines.  Keyboard does a bit of Baroque arpeggio exercise.  The texture builds in layers.    8. The peacock.  Vocal takes center stage with a simple setting of pump organ and brass swathing him.  Do I hear Tim Buckley near by?!  9. Port of call.  Simple strummed guitar.  Add forthright, warm vocal.  As usual, the guitar sets the pulse; the vocal flows slowly, steady, in smooth lines.  Add tightly cycling (seemingly strummed) piano.  And of course brass, but now in an oompahing ¾-time counter rhythm, which rolls over into the piano.  Quite a set piece of development.

I saw this book was recommend by a \\"crazy stalker obsessive hero\\" discussion thread, and I didn't feel like reading the description on amazon... so I just read the sample portion of the book, I liked what I read in the sample so I bought the book.  Two Things I didn't know going into it:  1) This is a BDSM romance  2) This is a trilogy (I just finished reading the book and when I reached the end it said \\"end of part one\\", and I was thinking 'oh crap I got duped into reading a series' lol)   I'm glad I didn't know these things going into it, becaue I definitley WOULD NOT have bought the book.  The main reason why I would give this book a 3.5  is because: (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)  1) Ana said she needed space but she was emailing Christian all the time, that didn't make any sense to me.  2) Ana would get angry at Christian and then take him back so easily, I wanted her to make him sweat a little.  3) This book/their relationship was frustrating (but I know now that i was frustrated because I thought I was gonna get all  the answers in this one book, but it is a series... so no)  This book was really good, and I didn't expect it to be,  I still don't know how I feel about BDSM, but I am intrigued enough by this book to purchase the next one.
030788743X|1.0|As a lifelong video game lover, movie buff, child of the 80/90's a book whose premise is a future war for power set inside a huge MMORPG of sorts seemed right up my alley.<br /><br />Having read 'Ready Player One' I can say that I was completely let down.  The book quickly becomes a massive tome of obscure references in which the author takes great joy in pointing out as many in-jokes, movie/music/video game nods as possible so that readers will feel that great joy of 'I totally get that joke/movie/game reference'.  Instead it takes away from the tension and action that could be built just because the author wants you to know that he knows those areas better than you.  This also leads to a muddling of what type of virtual world/internet/video game this is, you can wear armor or carry blasters and characters can dress however they want and live in secure basements but jump into a mini millennium falcon...<br /><br />The world itself also falls flat. When it comes to a virtual world the author has to try and up the ante by saying 'There are like hundreds of worlds! and you get to them on totally rad machines, you know, rad the saying, like from the 80's?!'.<br /><br />If there is a sequel on the horizon I would suggest this: PUSH THE BUTTON on page 1 and start over!  Or look at the bleak future that is ripe for a fine story.  The pieces of the puzzle are there.
B004AYCWY4|1.0|Dawkin's book, THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH has shown why naturalistic SCIENTISM BY ASSUMPTIONS is the flavour of our era, and is now that darling of the scientific establishment. Gone are the days when everything in science was regarded as &quot;tentative&quot; and &quot;not necessarily the final word.&quot; The scientific world is now on the impossible illusionary quest to define ALL REALITY using &quot;limited&quot; human insights and &quot;finite&quot; reason, to arrive at the &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;.<br /><br />The scientific world was founded on solid verifiable science, provided by the principle of Methodological naturalism and the empirical scientific method. This foundation would serve as the foundation to launch a new foundation for science. Founded on &quot;assumptions&quot; rather than observation and experiment. Using unverifiable assumptions and inferences in the quest to discover the &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;, to determine ultimate nature of ultimate reality. A quest that would be founded on &quot;inferences&quot; and &quot;explanations&quot; as to what supposedly happen in the unobserved past.  With hypothetical theories and theoretical &quot;mind experiments&quot; providing the new foundation of this naturalistic ideology. None of which can ever be scientifically verified by the scientific method.<br /><br />The underlying delusion was that &quot;limited&quot; human insights and &quot;finite&quot; scientific knowledge, would enable modern science to define the ultimate nature of ultimate reality. With the scientific world fully embracing a &quot;naturalistic&quot; Theory of Everything. Which the scientific world believed would answer the ultimate questions of life and existence.<br /><br />This delusion is founded on an unrealistic and unachievable quest! For it is impossible to achieve a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; while ever unresolved mysteries and issues still exist, as they do, and invariably will. Said philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, &quot;A finite point without an infinite reference point is meaningless and absurd.&quot; As is the godless naturalistic worldview of raw materialism.<br /><br />Jonathan Sarfati's book, THE GREATEST HOAX ON EARTH has tackled this gradual shift from verifiable and testable science, to unverifiable naturalistic ideology. In this book he takes on naturalism's leading advocate and evangelists, Richard Dawkins. Cheered on by the established scientific order. Which has fully embraced the illusion that science can, and will, define ALL REALITY solely by natural events and material processes alone.<br /><br />Sarfati's book exposes the highly subjective ASSUMPTIONS underlying Dawkins' &quot;philosophical naturalism&quot; and his &quot;inference&quot; based Darwinism. He presents the alternative theistic worldview, and offers a different interpretation of dating data.<br /><br />He, also exposes the &quot;spin&quot; and &quot;bait-and switch&quot; tactics of Dawkins. As can be seen in his ploy to change the status on Darwinian theory, as we shall shortly see.<br /><br />Dawkins' &quot;spin&quot; starts with the opening statements in his first chapter - Only a Theory. His propaganda begins by creating the illusion that evolution is an undisputed fact, and that believing in evolution will not undermine peoples religion or faith. To this end he cleverly parades a large entourage of well known Bishops and Church leaders, including the Pope, who have uncritically embraced evolution. With Dawkins subsequently revealing that these [useful idiots] are driving the hearse to their own funeral. Making it blatantly clear, both in this book and others, including The God Delusion, that his real agenda is the destruction of the both faith and religion.<br /><br />In this book Dawkins emphasizes the strategic importance of Darwin's theory of evolution. Namely, to show that the living world would now be explained without reference or regard to God or the supernatural. Meaning, God was no longer needed, or wanted, to explain the origin and diversity of life and species. Demonstrating that with the growing acceptance of Darwin's evolutionary theory, the Biblical view of origins by special creation would became less credible, with the Bible itself increasingly regarded as myth or legend.<br /><br />Darwin well understood the far-reaching consequences of his theory. As did his many supporters, then and now. Darwin's &quot;God banishing&quot; theory had immediate appeal to a sizable portion of the public who had no interest in God or religion, or were openly hostile to theism, Christianity, and the ecclesiastical establishment. Over time this would generate a vast global network of activists including atheists, agnostics, socialists, communists, leftist liberals, Unitarians, Humanists and others intent on establishing a new &quot;godless&quot; order. This oceanic swell of support for Darwinism would develop into a global tsunami that would sweep across the world, to flood the Christian landscape, and flush away the theistic Christian worldview.<br /><br />Darwin's 'bulldog' Thomas Huxley saw the ecclesiastical establishment as the enemy of evolution and science. And his strategy was to &quot;white ant&quot; the ecclesiastical spirit and clericalism. Stated Huxley, &quot;It is with this intent that I have subordinated any reasonable or unreasonable ambition for scientific fame, which I may have permitted myself to entertain, to other ends; to the popularization of science; to the development and organization of scientific education; to the endless series of battles and skirmishes over evolution; and to untiring opposition to that ecclesiastical spirit, that clericalism, which in England, as everywhere else, and to whatever denomination it may belong, is the deadly enemy of science.&quot; - Autobiography (1890) Collected Essays I<br /><br />Every effort was made to have Darwinism entrenched in the public mindset, primarily in science, and also within the church itself. To this end Huxley, actively lobbied to have Darwin entombed in Westminster Abby, along with other notables, honored by both Church and state.<br /><br />The evolutionary &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; - specifically devised to make God and the supernatural both unnecessary and irrelevant - would naively be taken into the church. Ultimately embraced by large segments of the established church, including the Pope, Bishops, priests, clergy, and many professing Christians. All conscripted to drive the hearse to their own funeral. For Darwin's buried presence under Westminster Abby was symbolic. His theory of evolution would stealthily and steadily erode the Abby's theistic foundations. For, as show by atheist Denial Dennett, Darwinism would be the acid that would slowly erode Christian theology and culture, and dissolve foundational Biblical doctrine. As Darwinian's and Dawkins intend.<br /><br />Dawkins naturally goes on to berate evolutionary minded Church leaders and pastors for hanging on to any residue of Biblical doctrine or foundational beliefs. States Dawkins, &quot; To return to the enlightened bishops and theologians, it would be nice if they'd put a bit more effort into combating the anti-scientific nonsense that they deplore. All too many preachers, while agreeing that evolution is true and Adam and Eve never existed, will then blithely go into the pulpit and make some moral or theological point about Adam and Eve in their sermons without once mentioning that, of course, Adam and Eve never actually existed! If challenged they will protest that they intended a purely 'symbolic' meaning, perhaps something to do with 'original sin', or the virtues of innocence. They may add witheringly that, obviously, nobody would be so foolish to take their words literally. But do their congregations know that. How is the person in the pew, or on the prayer-mat, supposed to know which bits of scripture to take literally, which symbolically?&quot; (p.8)<br /><br/>Dawkins then progressively spells out in great detail precisely why Darwin's theory of &quot;natural selection&quot;, and the godless evolutionary continuum, eliminates the need for both God and religion. Thus revealing that Darwinism is truly the &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; built to penetrate the Christian fortress and city of God. While providing the foundation for rise and entrenchment of godless humanism and atheism. With Dawkins, the noted atheist and Humanist of the Year, leading the charge. Fully supported by fellow atheists, and the Humanist inspired and spawned global network, the NCSE included.<br /><br />Indeed, since the time of Darwin, evolutionary minded activists, comprising a vast global network of humanists, atheists, and countless evolutionary minded scientists, have furiously worked for over 150 years to entrench Darwinism as an established fact in mainstream science (until proved wrong). And secure sole and exclusive status for Darwinism in science education, to the exclusion of all else, particularly special creation by God. All were assured that Darwinism will never be proved wrong, as &quot;explanations&quot; and endless &quot;assumptions&quot; are invented to cover any and every contingency, making Darwinism unfalsifiable.<br /><br />It would be of interest to readers that not only did this global activist network specifically target politics and education, but would wage war with theism and Christianity through the courts. Starting in the U.S. with the Clarence Darrow orchestrated scopes trial, to get evolution into education. Building up to the U. S. Supreme Court challenge by foremost atheist Madelyn Murray OHair, to secure separation of Church and State. With the ACLU then using this separation to legally eradicate Christianity and Creationist views from science and public education.<br /><br />As noted by Dr. Paul Kengor, &quot;Significantly, Darrow was an early ACLU member, founded in 1920 by fellow atheist, Roger Baldwin, who, at that point, was a pro-Soviet communist. As I wrote here previously, a huge component of the ACLU's initial work was defending American communists. ACLU members and Communist Party members flocked to one another, with atheism a common bond.&quot;<br /><br />The principle objective of all Dawkins' books, including this Magnum Opus, has been to kick God and religion out of science, education, culture, and his pantheistic/atheist universe, especially the Biblical minded clergy and creationists. To this end, Dawkins book has a single minded objective. To show that the origin and formation of all living creatures is a &quot;closed&quot; evolutionary continuum. For Dawkins knows that for Darwin's theory to work, it is essential that he prove that the evolutionary process is continual and unbroken. Only then could Dawkins account for the emergence of the vast verity of complex life-forms from the first simple form of life. Anything less would suggest that God had created the fundamental kinds, from which the vast variation of related species had emerged, just as the Bible stated.<br /><br />Dawkins thus opens with a salvo attacking those opposed to Darwinism, together with a solid rebuke of theistic evolutionists who still hold on to any residue of Biblical thinking.<br /><br />The next section of the first chapter looks at the nature of &quot;theory&quot;, as it relates to evolution, and is titled:<br /><br />WHAT IS A THEORY? WHAT IS A FACT?<br /><br />In this segment Dawkins again engages in verbal &quot;spin&quot; to change the ground rules. And thus misrepresents the true character of evolutionary theory. (P.9) He starts by defining the two Oxford definitions of what &quot;Theory&quot; means, which is worth repeating.<br /><br />Theory. Sense 1: A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed.<br /><br />Theory, Sense 2: A hypothesis proposed as an explanation; hence, a mere hypothesis, speculation, conjecture; an idea or set of ideas about something; an individual view or notion.<br /><br />Dawkins then uses his ever repeated &quot;bait and switch&quot; tactic. States Dawkins, &quot;Obviously the two meanings are quite different from one another. And the short answer to my question about the theory of evolution is that the scientists are using Sense I. while the creationists are - perhaps mischievously, perhaps sincerely - opting for Sense 2.&quot;. His &quot;short answer&quot; simply switches the category of evolutionary theory, without justification, from the &quot;unobserved&quot; theoretical sense 2, to that of verifiable &quot;observable and experimental&quot; science sense 1, relating to theories that can be tested, repeated and publicly verified by the Empirical &amp; Scientific Method.<br /><br />The sense 1 definition of &quot;Theory&quot; specifically states that it relates to &quot;a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by OBSERVATION or EXPERIMENT,. . . something KNOWN or OBSERVED&quot;. The defining words being &quot;established by observation or experiment.&quot; and &quot;know and observed.&quot;<br /><br />Never in all of recorded history has anyone ever &quot;observed&quot; any life-form evolve into a life-form of a different kind. As Dawkins himself confessed. Said Dawkins, &quot;Evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while its happening.&quot; (Interview, December 2004, PBS Network) Dawkins thus observed evolution without observing it happening. Makes perfect sense?<br /><br />This reality means that evolutionary theory is not verifiable by the empirical scientific method, and for good reason. Darwin's Theory of evolution is based on &quot;unobserved&quot; and &quot;unrepeatable&quot; past events believed to have happened over a vast span of time, ensuring there could never be any observers. This reality makes it impossible for Darwin's evolutionary theory to ever be established by the scientific method, as the theory of evolution cannot be tested, repeated, by experiment or by observation. Ensuring that Darwinism would forever remain an &quot;unverifiable&quot; hypothesis, and never anything more.<br /><br />This firmly placed Darwin's Theory of Evolution firmly in Theory, Sense 2: &quot;A hypothesis proposed as an explanation; hence, a mere hypothesis, speculation, conjecture; an idea or set of ideas about something; an individual view or notion.&quot;<br /><br />Darwinism appeals entirely to &quot;explanatory power&quot;. And thus amounts to 'science' by &quot;explanations&quot;, rather that experiment or observation. Based entirely on subjective presuppositions, interpretations, inferences, conjecture, predictions, and sheer speculation. Darwinism ultimately represents a vast multitude of &quot;assumptions&quot;, with no possible way of ever scientifically &quot;establishing&quot; any of them. As there is no way of ever establishing whether evolution happened one way, and not another way, or even whether it happened at all.<br /><br />The rest of the chapter one comprises lengthy verbal semantics and padding that goes nowhere. Dawkins second chapter is titled:<br /><br />DOGS, COWS AND CABBAGES<br /><br />The purpose of this chapter is to soften up the reader for the &quot;giant leap of faith&quot; needed to accept the Darwinian continuum, the continual unbroken evolution of life from the simple to the complex. This chapter could well be called the &quot;perhaps&quot; chapter - &quot;perhaps minds were cowered&quot;; &quot;perhaps it was religious indoctrination&quot;; &quot;perhaps it was the daunting complexity of living organisms&quot;.<br /><br />Similar &quot;qualifiers&quot; appear throughout the whole chapter, and throughout the whole book: probably, may, possibly, given, according to, view, thought experiment, etc. etc. Such qualifies appear everywhere in propaganda relating to Darwinism, and are the pervading characteristic of negative reviews on this site, and the suggested links. Exposing the highly speculative nature of evolutionary theory.<br /><br />Like Darwin, Dawkins argues throughout the book that there was no limit or boundary to variations, even though breeders and horticulturalists have universally found otherwise, Darwin included. For Darwin too was involved in breeding pigeons, and well knew that pigeons only produced a vast variety of other pigeons. Never anything else. No breeder or horticulturalists had ever seen one life-form evolve into a life-form of a different kind. not ever. All they had ever observed was the emergence of a vast variety of sub-species with reproduction limits, even with hybrids.<br /><br />Darwin argued that while it could not happen in domestic breeding, it could happen over time in the wild. This giant leap of &quot;blind faith&quot; had no verifiable basis, then or now, in spite of the highly imaginative mental gymnastics engaged in by Dawkins and his many disciples.<br /><br />So, Dawkins tries yet another ploy. SCULPTING THE GENE POOL. He attempts to undermine breeding limits by asserting that the wild cabbage is an &quot;affront to essentialism and the immutability of species.&quot; Says Dawkins, &quot;The wild cabbage, Brassica oleracea, is an undistinguished plant, vaguely like the weedy version of a domestic cabbage.&quot; Stating that horticulturists have selectively bred a vide variety of offshoots from this plant. But this too is &quot;spin&quot;, as horticulturists well know there IS a limit to what can be produced from the genetic rich pool of this wild plant. As is the case for the wild wolf, and every other life-form. A fact known to every breeder and horticulturist, and to Dawkins.<br /><br />Thus, in spite of 22 pages of verbal semantics and mental gymnastics this chapter proves nothing, and goes nowhere. His endless rambling about essentialism and Mendel's Law and related discoveries, offers nothing in support of the &quot;evolutionary continuum&quot; from the simple to the complex. We simply discover what everyone already knows. That dogs produce a wide variety of other dogs; that cows produce a wide variety of other cows, and that cabbages produce a variety of other cabbages. In short, dog in, dog out; cow in cow out; cabbage in, cabbage out.<br /><br />Along with the origin of life and other unexplained phenomena, this reality remains one of the major problems for Darwinism, to this very day. While everyone has observed &quot;micro&quot; variation occurring in all forms of life, no one has ever observed a &quot;macro&quot; change taking place. One that produces a new and different life forms. None-the-less, Dawkins book is a gigantic effort prove otherwise. And he fully describes the attempts made by scientists (Richard Lenski etc) in the laboratory to show that this could happen, as confirmation of Darwinism. (p. 116)<br /><br />It turns out that this 'unnatural' selective experimentation is yet another variation within the same kind of life-form. Lenski puts lots of bacteria into the category mix and watches what happens over 20 years. And what does Lenski finally discover......wait for it .....bacteria, of another variety. Showing that Bacteria have the pre-existing capacity to metabolized, to ensure that they survive &quot;as bacteria&quot;, and not change into something different. Lenski showed that bacteria can develop the ability to metabolize citrate, and elsewhere even plastic, in order to survive &quot;as Bacteria&quot;. Thus, we observe the &quot;preservation&quot; of a particular category, rather than bacteria evolving into something different.<br /><br />All of which further establishes the Biblical view that everything was created and reproduces &quot;after itskind.&quot; A breeders know the limits of kinds, however defined.

End of story!<br /><br />However, Dawkins goes to great length to blur the limits of reproduction and cross breeding, intent on creating the illusion that there is no &quot;natural&quot; boundary or limits to variation. Even thought breeders know that in artificial selection there are cross-breeding limits, even with hybrids. Dawkins even admits that Darwin used a similar ploy in On The Origin of Species to &quot;soften up&quot; his audience. Fostering a mindset that would cause them to accept natural selection, and the &quot;unobservable&quot; evolutionary continuum. Says Dawkins, &quot;He was softening his readers up to take delivery of his own great insight, the power of natural selection.&quot; (p.42)<br /><br />This approach works to get the vast majority of his readers on side. All Dawkins has to do now is present the &quot;incontrovertible&quot; evolutionary &quot;assumptions&quot; that prove the &quot;evolution is a fact&quot;, until proved wrong.<br /><br />So, it's time I shared with you a some of the &quot;spin&quot; techniques Dawkins and other Darwinian fundamentalist use to sell the goods. Its nice to know how the hard core Darwinians go about it, as you can learn from the experts, particularly Dawkins.<br /><br />So now its time to enter the Darwinian Wonderland to see how Darwinian fundamentalists play the dating &quot;assumptions&quot; game to promote their godless naturalistic scientism.<br /><br />THE &quot;ASSUMPTIONS&quot; DATING GAME.<br /><br />How to use ASSUMPTIONS to determine the age of the universe and the earth!<br /><br />ASSUMPTIONS are extremely important when you don't have any solid facts to prove your &quot;assumptions&quot;. As noted by New Scientist in The Dating Game, &quot;Figuring out the age of the universe involves a SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS about its geometry, expansion rate and composition.&quot; [Emphasis made]. Knowing exactly how and when the universe was formed involves even more assumptions. As acknowledged by Kiri Bielby in The Coreshine Effect, &quot;Astronomers know very little about the beginning of star life. . . . So when it comes to the birth of a star astronomers have been left in the dark - literally&quot; (Cosmos Issue 36 December 2010 p.16)<br /><br />Of course, everyone and his dog knows that the universe is 13.57 Billion years old, and that the earth is 4.5 billion years - and, by extension, the solar system is not much older. These dating ASSUMPTIONS are really 'rock solid', and send the Bible &quot;literalists&quot; into a spin, placing them into an impossible position to defend. As unverifiable &quot;assumptions&quot; can be dreamed up to cover any and every situation. Which is why &quot;explanations&quot; of &quot;unobserved&quot; past events, using unverifiable &quot;assumptions&quot;, works so well.<br /><br />How the dating &quot;assumptions&quot; game is done:<br /><br />The key dating element is &quot;assumptions&quot;, and the key word is &quot;time&quot;. Which you will &quot;assume&quot; has been uniform and constant throughout all &quot;time&quot;.<br /><br />The Tools:<br /><br />First get your bag of unverifiable naturalistic presuppositions, inferences, predictions, explanations, conjecture, and speculations out. Then get your Uniformitarian &quot;assumptions&quot; clock machine ready.<br /><br />Now its dating &quot;assumptions&quot; time.<br /><br />THE METHOD: First make some preliminary &quot;assumptions&quot; to exclude anything other than &quot;natural&quot; causes. As these will destroy your entire dating assumptions and methods.<br /><br />1. Assume that God does not exist, and never created anything.<br />2. Assume that God was never involved at any time, in any way.<br />3. Assume it's &quot;impossible&quot; for God to create a fully functional universe.<br />4. Assumethat the natural material world is all that exists, or can exist.<br />5. Assume that the universe made itself, and naturally formed everything.<br />6. Assume that &quot;science alone&quot; can determine the true nature of ultimate reality<br /><br />Now, add your Uniformitarian cosmological &quot;time&quot; assumptions.<br /><br />7. Assume that &quot;time&quot; has been UNIFORMILY CONSTANT throughout all of time.<br />8. Assume that Einstein's Theory of Relativity does not relate to time.<br />9. Assume that Relativistic Time Dilation plays no part at any time, at any place.<br />10. Assume that Cosmological Relativity never affected &quot;time&quot; in any way.<br />11. Assume that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, including<br /><br />Now, add your &quot;unalterable&quot; Uniformitarian geology clock time &quot;assumptions&quot;.<br /><br />12. Choose only a naturalistic clock.<br />13. Assume only slow processes involved throughout all of time.<br />14. Assume initial conditions, set time at zero.<br />15. Assume that there was no major factors or catastrophe/s involved.<br />16. Assume nothing else has ever interfered with clock.<br />17. Assume the clock was always same gradual speed<br />18. Assume that you know everything about what happened in the past.<br />19. Assume that there is nothing you don't know about how things age.<br />20. Assume your uniformitarian dating methods and results are confirmed.<br />21. Interpret all data to conform to deep time.<br />22 Ensure the same &quot;assumptions&quot; apply to all your dating methods.<br /><br />The ASSUMPTION Dating Game Outcome:<br /><br />You can now ASSUME that it all happened by natural events and material process alone, to the exclusion of God.<br /><br />And ASSUME that God is no longer needed to account for the universe or anything else, as it all happened naturalistically.<br /><br />Thus, you can ASSUME that the universe and earth are &quot;really&quot; old.<br /><br />More important, you can now ASSUME that you know exactly how the universe and everything else formed, including all living creatures, and even the Hawaiian Islands. Even though you have no way of ever knowing whether it happened that way, and not some another way. (unless you have access to a time machine.)<br /><br />These &quot;assumptions&quot;, together with multitude of unverifiable &quot;assumptions&quot; underlying philosophical NATURALISM and DARWINISM, will enable you to engage in elaborate mental gymnastics and verbal semantics to show that the &quot;inferences&quot; underlying your many &quot;assumption&quot; are fully supported by all the other &quot;unverifiable assumptions&quot;, including all those above.<br /><br />NOW FOR A &quot;TIMELY&quot; WARNING!<br /><br />You will need to know that if any of the above assumptions are wrong - your dead.<br /><br />As you CANNOT prove that God does not exist or was not involved - YOUR DEAD!<br /><br />Your dead empirically because. . .<br /><br />Unobserved and unrepeatable past events can never be verified by the scientific method. Thus, your hypothetical naturalistic &quot;assumptions&quot; will always be based on unverifiable &quot;inferences&quot;, as there is no possible way of ever establishing that &quot;unobserved&quot; past events happened a particular way, and no other way.<br /><br />Your dead philosophically because. . .<br /><br />The delusion of NATURALISM is founded on an unrealistic and unachievable quest! As it is impossible to achieve a Theory of Everything while ever unresolved mysteries and issues still exist, as they do, and invariably will. Said philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, &quot;A finite point without an infinite reference point is meaningless and absurd.&quot;<br /><br />Thus, it is impossible for you to ever establish that life and existence is solely the result of natural events and material process alone, to the exclusion of God and other transcendent realities. As your insights will always be &quot;limited&quot; by &quot;finite&quot; human knowledge and understanding. Meaning, that you will never ever be in a position to know, that you really know, that you really know. In which case all your naturalistic assumptions have no rational or scientific foundation.<br /><br />Your dead scientifically because. . .<br /><br />Foundational scientific realities reveal that the universe had to be optimally formed and fine tuned from the very &quot;beginning&quot;, or we wouldn't be here.<br /><br />Scientists universally acknowledge that the universe is moving from an initial state of minimum entropy, to a final state of maximum entropy. Meaning, that the universe must have &quot;started out&quot; in a state of maximum information, order and usable energy.<br /><br />States noted physicist Paul Davies, &quot;Mystery surrounds how order has emerged out of chaos in the universe. The present orderly structures and complex activity has somehow arisen from the featureless ferment of the big bang, in apparent defiance of the second law of thermodynamics which requires that order decreases, rather than increases, with time. The resolution of the paradox may concern the peculiar properties of gravity.&quot;<br /><br />Davies is not disputing the FACT that the universe started out this way, but rather the &quot;mystery&quot; and &quot;paradox&quot; as to how it could ever happen naturalistically. His appeal to gravity goes nowhere, as gravity is merely a &quot;distortion&quot; of space-time, and thus could not have ordered or organized anything.<br /><br />There is also the matter of the fine-tuning of the cosmos. Many fundamental traits, forces, and physical constants--like the charge of the electron or the strength of gravity--make it appear as if everything about the physical state of the universe were tailor-made for life. Some researchers call this revelation the Goldilocks principle, because the cosmos is not &quot;too this&quot; or &quot;too that&quot; but rather &quot;just right&quot; for life.<br /><br />Scientists universally acknowledge that sub-atomic particles were precisely balanced at the very &quot;beginning&quot;, otherwise there would be no universe, and no you.<br /><br />Scientists likewise universally acknowledge that all the cosmological constants were precisely tuned from the very &quot;beginning&quot;, otherwise there would be no universe, and no you.<br /><br />Scientist further universally acknowledge that the most unique molecule in the universe, the water molecule, was also there from the very &quot;beginning&quot;.<br /><br />The WATER MOLECULE not only has unique properties that allows it to exist as a gas, liquid or solid within a very short temperature range, but also has a unique arrangement of hydrogen atoms, displaced by 120 degrees, that allows water to move up all plant life against gravity, without which no like could ever exist.<br /><br />As revealed by New Scientist, &quot;Water's quantum weirdness makes life possible.&quot; States New Scientist, &quot;WATER'S life-giving properties exist on a knife-edge. It turns out that life as we know it relies on a fortuitous, but incredibly delicate, balance of quantum forces. Water is one of the planet's weirdest liquids, and many of its most bizarre features make it life-giving. For example, its higher density as a liquid than as a solid means ice floats on water, allowing fish to survive under partially frozen rivers and lakes. And unlike many liquids, it takes a lot of heat to warm water up even a little, a quality that allows mammals to regulate their body temperature.&quot; Concludes New Scientist, &quot; We are used to the idea that the cosmos's physical constants are fine-tuned for life. Now it seems water's quantum forces can be added to this &quot;just right&quot; list.&quot; (25 October 2011 by Lisa Grossman. Magazine issue 2835.)<br /><br />All of which points to the reality that the universe and life started out in an optimum entropy state.For if the foundational structure of the universe was fully formed and fully functional from the &quot;beginning&quot;, as it appears, it is probable that everything else started out in fully formed and functional state, as well.<br /><br />Which is precisely why everything ever observed in natural world and in the fossil record is also fully formed and functional, as Stephen J Gould well noted.<br /><br />Which is why 40% of Americans have trouble taking Darwin's, and Dawkins, evolutionary Wonderland seriously. Darwinism not only represents naturalistic SCIENTISM BY &quot;ASSUMPTIONS&quot;, but also amounts to believing the unbelievable, and thinking the unthinkable!<br /><br />Dawkins Darwinian Wonderland is rightfully seen as a magical place where an &quof verbal semantics and mental gymnastics this chapter proves nothing, and goes nowhere. His endless rambling about essentialism and Mendel's Law and related discoveries, offers nothing in support of the &quot;evolutionary continuum&quot; from the simple to the complex. We simply discover what everyone already knows. That dogs produce a wide variety of other dogs; that cows produce a wide variety of other cows, and that cabbages produce a variety of other cabbages. In short, dog in, dog out; cow in cow out; cabbage in, cabbage out.<br /><br />Along with the origin of life and other unexplained phenomena, this reality remains one of the major problems for Darwinism, to this very day. While everyone has observed &quot;micro&quot; variation occurring in all forms of life, no one has ever observed a &quot;macro&quot; change taking place. One that produces a new and different life forms. None-the-less, Dawkins book is a gigantic effort prove otherwise. And he fully describes the attempts made by scientists (Richard Lenski etc) in the laboratory to show that this could happen, as confirmation of Darwinism. (p. 116)<br /><br />It turns out that this 'unnatural' selective experimentation is yet another variation within the same kind of life-form. Lenski puts lots of bacteria into the category mix and watches what happens over 20 years. And what does Lenski finally discover......wait for it .....bacteria, of another variety. Showing that Bacteria have the pre-existing capacity to metabolized, to ensure that they survive &quot;as bacteria&quot;, and not change into something different. Lenski showed that bacteria can develop the ability to metabolize citrate, and elsewhere even plastic, in order to survive &quot;as Bacteria&quot;. Thus, we observe the &quot;preservation&quot; of a particular category, rather than bacteria evolving into something different.<br /><br />All of which further establishes the Biblical view that everything was created and reproduces &quot;after itskind.&quot; A breeders know the limits of kinds, however defined. In short, bacteria in, bacteria out; pigeon in, pigeon out. finch in, finch out; fruit fly in, fruit fly out. End of story!<br /><br />However, Dawkins goes to great length to blur the limits of reproduction and cross breeding, intent on creating the illusion that there is no &quot;natural&quot; boundary or limits to variation.

0385535139|5.0|I'd like to note right off the top that I read and finished The Litigators over the course of 10 hours of my Sunday afternoon and night......and since the advent of Facebook and its myriad of ways of distracting someone, that has not even come close to happening.  Until now.  It's that engaging and entertaining.  Is it John Grisham's best work?  Of course not.  Is it a rehashing of some of his previous plots?  Absolutely.  Does it matter?  Nope.  I'm sure you saw the summary further up the page:  Finley & Figg, Attorneys at Law, and their new associate.  Oscar Finley is a tired ex-cop who's running out the string;  Wally Figg, a recovering alchoholic dreaming of the big score; David Zinc, the Harvard boy completely burned out after five years in a mega-firm, who wanders into the 'boutique firm' of the others after the best and worst day of his life.  The three of them stumble through some street law, and a really bad attempt to become players in the bigger game.  Right now I'm seeing echoes of The Rainmaker, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The King of Torts........need I go on?  But unlike the negative reviewers on here, it didn't bother me.  Part of the reason you read Grisham now is the familiarity of it all, the technology changes, but not John's sympathy for the 'common' lawyer and his contempt for larger firms that bully his heroes.  David Zinc is the protagonist here, and while I don't think that his breakdown is given enough backstory, who wouldn't crack after working five years of 90 hour weeks?  He's often the voice of reason with his bosses, but he knows enough to know that he doesn't know a whole lot.  Think Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker, with a better education and a stable love life.  Yes, you read that right, there's very little romance in the book.  David is happily married, and his wife is actually a pleasant character to read about.  The significant others of Finley and Figg aren't, so it's a nice balance.  The antagonist is the drug company that'spart of the major lawsuit in the piece, but even then the CEO, while not a hero, can credibly be seen as just doing his job.  More or less.  In reality the antagonists are Finley and Figg, in a manner.  Figg thinks that he knows more than he does, and Finley works a lot less than  he should.  But we care about David, and as the novel goes on, he finds himself on firming footing as a lawyer.  He wins and he loses, and learns from both.  For all intents and purposes John Grisham has run low on ideas, that can't be disputed by me.  The Theodore Boone series is perhaps a way for him to get a break from the norm, and those are solid novels in their own right.  That said, I don't need every book to break new ground.  As the saying goes, there are only a few original stories out there, everything else is just a variation.  Anyone expecting the great American novel from John is kidding themselves, and he'd be the first to agree with me.  I just want to be entertained sometimes, and he satisfies that plenty.  Five stars.
067960085X|3.0|This review is based on the first story in this anthology - Breakfast at Tiffany's. After reading this short story I had a lot of questions about Truman Capote. I will admit, I know nothing about him. I've never read any of his other works and I've never seen the movie, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\".<br /><br />The reason I want to know more about Capote is this - I feel this story is not great. It's a mad dash of thoughts, an essay and outline of sorts about an extreme character - Holiday Golightly. We read about her, saw bits and pieces of her adventures through the narrator's eyes - but in my opinion, never felt her. I wasn't convinced.<br /><br />Writers often hear the phrase - show, don't tell. To me this story was a lot of telling. I was drawn to and believed the downstairs neighbor, Madame Spanella. I felt her - I got the emotion of her character. Capote showed us who she was. The others, not so much.<br /><br />So it made me wonder about Truman Capote. Was he an unknown? Did he have high profile friends at the time of this writing? Was he a socialite who wined and dined with Norman Mailer, and others similar to him? Was his fame the reason for the success of Breakfast at Tiffany's or did his success come after?<br /><br />This story was a letdown for me. I feel its success may have been due to factors other than the writing and that is kind of bothersome.

With the world audiences having been caught in the webs of spiders and roller-coastered by the flights of supermen, this (comparitively) tame Captain pales in comparison.

This movie has not used the special-effects technology available in today's times to its advantage. Or maybe the producers were saving bigger action for a sequel. Whatever the reason/s, the movie is average. Yes, the only thing which is amazing is the shrunk avatar of the main lead, before he is transformed into captain-america. One is forced to think if the smaller guy is the real life step-motherly-fed sibling of Chris Evan? Thats where they have used technology to good effect. Overall a passable movie. I hope the next serving is sumptuous. Captain America 2, you better be a super hero. Rating - 2.5/5
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I shopped around for an BT adapter for my 160gb iPod classic for some time, as I really wanted something that provided the ability to charge the unit while using the BT connection as well.  However, there were only a few of those that I could find anywhere, and they ALL had awful reviews.  So, I decided that I wanted something that was reliable and low-powered so as not to kill the battery.  This one seemed to be the one that fit the bill perfectly.  And, it has worked flawlessly!  I had NO problem pairing it with my Motorola S9-HD headsets and the range is absolutely fine.  I can move around most of my office with the unit functioning and have no cut-outs at all (and I work in a data center!).  It really doesn't seem to put too much of a load on the battery (as far as I can tell).  Not to mention the fact that it really is small!  Fit my needs perfectly!
0802130208|1.0|I just finished reading this book and I cannot explain how disappointed I am.  If you want to read about a bunch of dunces go for it, because that is ALL this book is!  Every character is a moron.  Each in their own way.  The only two characters that had any redeemable qualities were side characters. Jones, a black man who was simply trying to get by without going to jail, and Mr. Levey a man who inherited wealth from his father.  Mr. Levey somehow has a bit of a conscious and if it were not for the fact that he had been handed everything and his wife was a typical gold digger, he may have been a decent person.  Jones is a confused black man who is just trying to keep from going to jail and is rightfully afraid of the police.    Ignatious is the main character and from the moment I met him I wanted to strangle him.  In every way imaginable, he is a worthless piece of a human!  Occasionally he will make some smart remark about how the justice system in america has failed or about how psychiatry wards not helpful to their patients, but these moments only last a few seconds and then Ignatious is back to his self centered, judging, deceiving and confused self.    As far as I can tell, Ignatisous' mom let him become the way he is, and now regrets it, but she is too stupid and beta to do anything about it.  There is police officer who for some reason wishes to stay loyal to the police force even though they treat him like crap and he is too stupid to do anything worthwhile.  There is a trashy bar owner who thinks her bar is classy.  There is a woman who works in that bar who wants to be a professional dancer.  I'm not going to lie, I didn't get any of the references in this book so maybe that is where I missed the hype.  Overall it didn't go anywhere and there were no characters I could connect with or enjoy hanging out with.  On top of that, this book was so dreary and pitiful it brought my spirit down too.  The writing really is not bad, but not great either.  If your sense of humor finds slow, haunting, miserable ignorance in itself funny, maybe you will like this book.  Ill stick to something more upbeat like Tom Robbins myself.
B001CGJ3QS|3.0|Yes, Wilhelm Kempff was a truly gifted Beethoven interpreter, but IMHO his 1950s mono DG recordings captured his improvisatory, selfless essence much, much better! I strongly reccomend those over these.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Did not work for me at all. Tried recalibrating and repositioning several times. The few times I was able to get the Kinect to recognize my movements they were very erratic. Would love to see something that would allow us to use the Kinect in a smaller space, but this isn't it.
B005AUWXZ0|3.0|By now, most of you have read the spoiler reviews.  It wasn't the movie I had anticipated plot/story wise, but an interesting character development for Mater.  I was delighted to hear Michael Caine as Finn Mc Missle.  Perfect.  It is a good addition to my Disney/Pixar collection that both my grandchildren and I enjoy.
B005HS4CUY|1.0|Like all of the other reviews what I purchased and what I got were 2 different things. I thought I was getting 3D, 2D and digital versions of all 3 movies. I was very unhappy when I got only the 3D version. I would not have ordered these if I was only getting the 3D version. I have purchased many products from Amazon with both my personal and work accounts and now I may look elsewhere for future purchases. I'm very disappointed Amazon.

It has gotten hard to find new things to add to my skills, but i couldn't pass up this book.  It was all I was hoping for and then some. I am ordering another copy for my best friend as a gift.

B0018RWD6S|5.0|Bought this CD for a friend who's not that into jazz... yet.  What's not to like about this album?  Hartman's voice is just pure velvet - the man could flat-out sing.  Coltrane, well, is Coltrane - the best you'll ever hear.  Overall, the arrangements are inspired, and the music floats right into your ears.  Strikes a mood that makes you want to retire to the drawing room, light up a cigar and pour a glass of your favorite single malt.  Or take a break from the busy day and spend some quality time with your sweetheart.  Any way you cut it, this is simply one of the finest jazz albums ever recorded.
0810988232|5.0|It is true I see.  It is true I see, that I might tell you what I feel.  Of the cards that are purchased, bought, and sold to me.  I write a review that they can be understand,  No judgmental poke in the ribs of thee.  I pull, I read, I document the verse,  I smile, I cry, I scream, I curse.  The deck I spew on the glass below,  The cards read me, for better, for worse.  I do not judge, or rake, or sew,  I drop a card, 3, 4, or 5.  I do not drop a word below.  I lay a row of cards alive.  The cards explain in simple verse,  My past, my present, and future,  With a 1 or 2 assistance,  The little ones they love to lure.  I shall not try to ever blame,   I shall never, ever judge.  The cards they tell me, every time,  Without ever holding, a human grudge.  Thank you for the blow,  Of life so strong, so supreme.  Even if it is reversed,  You reverse the reverse, my friend serene.

B0055Q5F36|5.0|I cannot give enough praise for my Otterbox Commuter case. I have used Commuter cases for the last 2.5 years, both on my old iPhone and now my new GS2. They are not nearly as bulky as the Otterbox Defender cases, and slide easily in and out of your pocket. The materials are very good quality. The case comes in two parts - one rubber piece that completely surrounds the phone and another plastic piece that envelops the rubber. I made the mistake of dropping my iPhone a number of times while I was using it, and unlike many other people I know, my phone was never worse for the wear! Screen never broke, and of course the rest of the phone remained unscathed as well. I attribute that to the superior protection that this case provides. My wife thinks the case is ugly, but I quite enjoy the styling. The only caveat is that my GS2 won't fit on a desktop dock, but that's unavoidable. What more can I say? Buy it!

0439813786|5.0|This book has both a stunning story and illustrations! It is a simple read for Junior High students and very informative at the same time. It opens up a world most people aren't familiar with.  The drawings are superb!
0312576463|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this book.  It reminded me of a few people I know - I just hope their lives end up the same way.  Well written book.
1439192812|5.0|This book is gorgeously illustrated and brilliantly worded. I am biased toward both the author and illustrator, but I think that everyone can benefit from a book that can both teach you the basic science behind natural processes and show you that understanding those processes will only enhance the beauty you see in nature.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used to be a swype user and I'm so glad I switched. The honeymoon with swype lasted a while but there were a lot of things I didn't like. The predictions and speed with SwiftKey is amazing!
0439023483|5.0|This is my new favorite book. I have always loved watching dystopia/utopia stuff on tv, but I had never read any books in this genre. I absolutely loved it. I took a while to actually try it because from the description, I was not so sure I would like it. I thought it might be a little gruesome, etc. I was so drawn to the subplot - the love story. I love that the love story is the SUBplot so it is not centered around it, yet it's there. So even my husband loved this book as well. The story is so compelling.
B000244EMO|5.0|I'll sum it up with: Elite spec ops unit, jungle, and mysterious hunter. These ingredients created one of the best science fiction action movies of all time. After nearly three decades, Predator never fails to draw you into its world and make you tremble. By far one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best films with the utmost respect going toward the late great Kevin Peter Hall; without him, we wouldn't have had the sneaky human trophy collecting alien that we're all so familiar with. The hat is off to Predator. It is one of a kind.
0385534639|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was  expecting a little more, but nonetheless, i enjoyed and recommend it to anyone who enjoys a little magic.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Daniel Kahneman has studied the standard traps and pitfalls of human thinking for decades. The conclusions are at once wonderful and terrible, but the book is guaranteed to amaze and entertain you.<br /><br />For example, what's your best guess of the percentage of African nations in the UN? What's your estimate of the number of practicing physicians in your city? It's hard to imagine that one's estimates would be affected by having just written down the 10 or 65 that came up on a wheel of fortune (or reciting the last 4 digits of a Social Security number), but it seems that such unrelated events do affect us. Who would imagine that putting a \\"limit 12\\" on a supermarket display would cause customers to buy more, or that capping medical malpractice awards could cause them to go up?<br /><br />In summary, if you enjoy knowing how our minds work this is a wonderful book.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie came on time. It was used but played wonderfully. Th packaging was in tact. My daughter is very happy.
B0056BMK6K|3.0|I bought this Kindle book as I was intrigued to see how John Locke had done it, cracked a million books sold on Kindle.  It was easy to read and interesting to see he claims he's not a writer.  I found some of his strategies useful, like working out your target audience, others were obvious and most of us Indie authors already do - Twitter, Facebook, Blog and Website.  I was impressed by how much time and effort Locke puts into emailing his loyal fan base, and how he intereacts with them.  Unfortunately, I seriously don't have the time to do all that, if I still want time to write my books.  Although this book is more of a marketing tool for his novels, it was thought-provoking and gave me some ideas.  I think I want to examine what I'm doing with Twitter, take a harder look at my target audience for each novel and develop friendships and contacts from the article directory I sometimes write for.  You have made me think, Mr Locke, so thank you.
0061900656|5.0|Sent this along as a gift for the big brother who had a little sister on the way. It was perfect because then he had a gift when Mommy came home with all the new things for Baby Alice. And Mommy appreciated the chance to talk about the baby while reading this with him. Perfect!
0307477479|5.0|This is a compilation of intertwined stories, somewhat like the book Olive Kitteredge. A few of the stories are gems all by themselves, with glimpses into the characters' deepest thoughts and worries. The last two chapters felt like a big reward for sticking with the book to the end. I enjoyed most of the stories on their own, but this is a case where the whole is worth more than the sum of its parts. The most fascinating aspect of the book for me was the ability to see characters from different points of view at different points in their lives. For instance, we get to see how a teenager really sees her parents, how a husband and wife see each other, and how many of the characters see themselves. I was able to find a character in each story that I could relate to in some way, based on different stages of my own life.     At the end I had an AHA moment. This is a great example of postmodernism! I remembered struggling with the concept in school, and now I feel like I get it. The story is deconstructed and put back together again; We are shown the world from multiple perspectives; and (especially in chapter 12) the author plays with a new way to tell a story. The last two chapters were the most creative and most thrilling to me. The author's view of the future world is both funny and cynical, with a clever combination of new and old trends. Young people will certainly relate to the ways in which communication technology is used to reach people and promote concerts. There is also a special nod to people who are old enough to remember how the entire marketing world catered to the (now aging) babyboomers from the time they were children. On the surface, this appears to be a book about the music world, but I think people in marketing, PR and communications will find it quite relevant.  I know that some people are annoyed by the non-linear structure of the book, and give up before reaching the end.  I suppose I might have too, if I didn't have a pending book club meeting to push me along. In the end it was well worth it. Tip: If you're taking some time between chapters, I suggest that you use post-it notes or a character list to keep track of the character names and relationships.
0307593312|2.0|Murakami is a great writer and I have read most of his books. This one is definitely puffed up, bland, repetitive, and (for me) uninteresting. Perhaps it is made worse in comparison by invoking a tight, haunting and still prescient masterpiece, Orwell s 1984. I suspect that not even a good editor could have saved 1Q84---but did it have an editor? In over 900 pages there are a few characters and sentences that are dazzling, but they do not justify the time spent reading this novel. A real pity. If you have not bought it yet, and you have not read Murakami, start elsewhere.

B000002BYD|4.0|YIELD was widely hailed at the time as a \\"return to form\\" after the diversity of NO CODE.  But this is all nonsense.  Yes, it opens with a fast rocker, \\"The Brain of J,\\" but YIELD is just as diverse as NO CODE, it doesn't rock harder, and it's certainly not a return to the grunge sound.<br /><br />The most notable song here is no doubt \\"Given to Fly,\\" a favorite of Pearl Jam fans that uses surfing as a powerful metaphor.  \\"Do the Evolution\\" is a unique and quite sarcastic song that includes a passage sung falsetto like a church choir, mocking the hypocritical morality of the Bible-thumpers.  \\"MFC\\" and \\"In Hiding\\" are two of my favorite Pearl Jam songs, the first an excellent rocker about driving that makes great driving music, and the second another one of Vedder's great ballads.  \\"Low Light\\" is an excellent low-key song.  \\"Faithfull\\" and \\"Wishlist\\" are solid numbers too.<br /><br />For me the weak tracks are \\"Pilate,\\" a song Jeff Ament wrote about his dog, the untitled hippie chant that follows \\"Do the Evolution\\" and the last two numbers -- \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" and \\"All These Yesterdays.\\"<br /><br />I think on balance YIELD might be slightly better than NO CODE, but they're similar in their stylistic diversity, and similar in that they are both mainly quite good but with a few weak tracks.<br /><br />YIELD did not win back all the TEN fans that had lost interest, and it was the last Pearl Jam album to go platinum.  From here on, the band would forge their own way, increasingly remote from their initial fame and overexposure.  And their next album, BINAURAL, would be one of their absolute best.
B005NJ2K6U|3.0|Game play was quick and I was able to get perfect on ask but 2 levels. They should have just added features to 1 and skipped the silly theme.
B000025QLX|4.0|NO CODE, from 1996, is the album that marked Pearl Jam's departure from the \\"grunge\\" sound to a wider range of possibilities.  The first half sounds great.  \\"Hail, Hail\\" is a great rocker, \\"Smile\\" is a Neil Young & Crazy Horse-style rocker with a great lyric about smiling when it's cloudy.  \\"In My Tree\\" is one of the album's best songs, one that starts soft and slow and then heats up and ends loud and fast, as is \\"Off He Goes.\\"  \\"Sometimes\\" is an interesting theological meditation.<br /><br />\\"Present Tense\\" might be the best song on the album, about living in the moment. \\"Habit\\" is another rocker addressing addiction, and \\"Red Mosquito\\" is a very quirky song sympathizing with a mosquito.  But the second half also has a few tracks that are sub-par. The very short rocker \\"Lukin\\" doesn't stick around long enough to make much of an impression.  Stone Gossard's \\"Mankind\\" is OK.  \\"I'm Open\\" features spoken word and doesn't impress me overly much.  The last song, \\"Around the Bend,\\" is an update of \\"Happy Trails,\\" a pretty song written as a children's lullaby.<br /><br />With NO CODE, Pearl Jam refused to be put in a box and embraced the entire realm of possibilities that included all of classic rock as well as punk and grunge and Nineties \\"alternative.\\"  It's not one of Pearl Jam's best albums, but definitely a good one.
B005UKK4Y2|1.0|We could only endure 22 minutes before ejecting this non-funny movie. We usually don't have issues with the occasional raunchy dialog but this was a little too low in the gutter for our taste. Definitely a let down :(
0446573019|5.0|I have been a fan of David Baldacci for many years.  He knows how to develop characters, and to keep the reader interested from srart to finish.  The character of John Puller is one that I expect will show up in future novels by Mr. Baldacci. He may be a bit too much of a superman, but I'd like to think there are men out there like him protecting our country.  I wanted the romance with Sam Cole to grow, and was saddened by her death.  But the door was left open for further involvement with Jean Cole and General Carson.  Clearly all of the readers of this book want to know more of why his brother is serving a life term for treason in military prison.  And their relationship with their famous father also must be developed further.  If you enjoy reading a well written book that keeps your attention, then this book is for you.[[ASIN:0446573019 Zero Day]]
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Puts me to sleep like nothing else.  Plenty of sounds and they sound good as well.  Love being able to mix sounds and vary volumes of each.
B004EPZ08E|1.0|I promptly returned this Blu-ray to Amazon after ordering due to the Ultraviolet digital copy being WORTHLESS! I paid extra for the digital copy version so that I could have something to watch on my iPad on a plane, etc. Unfortunately, the studios have decided that we need a new type of digital copy, separate from all of the digital versions we have on iTunes, etc. Terrible idea! I hope this new digital copy format promptly goes away so that I can go back to buying blus with confidence.   That being said, the movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it had enough moments to make for an enjoyable viewing experience.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I purchased this product for my son and not from an Amazon \\"direct\\" seller.  The Collection box was not in good shape, broken on one end, and appeared to have possibly been used even though I purchased the item as new.  I returned the item and found out later it was also missing pieces I didn't realize should have been included.
B00000JR2A|5.0|Thanks to modern techology I rediscovered this album recently, 21 yars after my LP/vinyl collection was stuffed away in the attic. Of all my \\"rediscoveries\\", this one stands out as beeing the most amazing. And why is that? Apart from being a timless extremely well crafted musical gem from start to end, Tears for Fears (including guest star Oleta Adams) are truly sowing the seeds of Love on this album. How many artist are doing that these days? If you dare to prefer \\"Love\\" to \\"Cool\\", I wouln't waste my time. Give your heart and soul a treat, share it with your friends and feel how the earth can be a wonderful place.

B005NKIQ26|5.0|Just want to say if this were a perfect world people wouldn't be afraid to admit they like his music. I have always felt that one should set trend and not worrying about what other's think is \\"cool\\". I'm a 35 yr old mom and yes I listen to Justin Bieber!  This is one really good Christmas album! It takes listening a couple of times to adjust to his deeper voice but nonetheless the album is in a word awesome!  The only negatives I have with it is the fact that \\"Someday At Christmas\\" seems to be recorded much earlier in his \\"younger\\" voice. First I wanna say that the track sounds great! It's just that it catches you a bit off guard since this album is advertised as his deeper voice. The first second or two he sounded so young I didn't even know who it was. I thought it was a child but then I guess chances are he was a child when he recorded this one. The other thing which isn't enough of a negative to deserve a rating of less than 5 stars is that the duet with Mariah Carey \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" is just ok at best. Since 14 out of 15 tracks were amazing 5 stars!!!!!
1439170916|5.0|This book is both interesting and compelling.  It is the story of the way human beings act and interact told against the backdrop of the story of the evolving understanding of cancer and the exigencies of treatment.

B000JQU1VS|3.0|I enjoyed the old school problem solving  methodologies of this classic.  I figured out many of cases, not to say they are predictable but I have knack for this sort of thing.  Maybe the movie ruined it for me but I think this book is about a three out of five, well written but I was a bit bored in spots, though worth a read.

0802473156|5.0|I purchased multiple books for our Deacon who is going through the five love languages every week for a group of about 20 couples as a way to renew marriages in our parish.  The bulk of the group are retirees who are excited about this class and they have found love again in their marriages some after 40+ years.  It is never too late.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Pet Sounds and had been introduced to Smile back in 2004 when I bought the solo edition that Brian Wilson produced. I liked it a lot in 2004 but I always wondered what the original would have sounded like with the Beach Boys. Well now the waiting is over! I was pleasantly surprised as I heard these songs with the Beach Boys behind the microphone. What beautiful harmonies and Brians voice sounds so much younger and innocent on this edition of Smile than on the 2004 edition. Brian has given us two of the most beautiful albums in music history in Pet Sounds and now Smile. The songs on Smile blend so well into each other and after a few listens they become part of your inner being. The music is far from dull and there are things going on with instrumentation and voices all through the album. Simply brilliant! I applaud Brian for having the courage to finish Smile in 2004 to give a template for this original edition. I feel as if this is such a huge addition to my music collection. I never thought I would have the Smile album with the Beach Boys on it. I lost track of the amount of times I listened to it this weekend. Give this a chance folks, it might take 3 or maybe 4 times but learn about the stories that it is telling, study the lyrics, and learn where the song breaks are. Once you get those down this album will reach down deep within you and provide you with a virtual smorgasborg of musical feasting! A pastiche served up by Brian and the boys will be sure to put a Smile on your face guaranteed! Thanks Brian and Capitol Records for releasing this Mona Lisa of music!
B002ZG9846|5.0|The action scenes in this movie are amazing.  It is violent and bloody but my 60 year old mother loved it.  Hit Girl is the coolest character in any movie in a long time.  Hopefully more people have seen it now that is has been on DVD and Blu Ray because it was criminally slept on in the movie theaters.
B000SMWUPS|2.0|Well, I was so excited to get this, but unfortunately it does not work on my stroller.  I have 2 peg perrego strollers and it did not work on either one.  It is a nice addition if it fits.  It is sturdy enough for a drink and the middle compartment seems perfect to throw your keys or whatever in.  Too bad for me, I'm still looking!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Buying this through Amazon.com was fast, easy, and it arrived quickly.  Very pleased with the purchase and the ease with which I can find what I want reasonably priced.
B003CN4R74|4.0|I think the latest album release from Evanescence is terrific. I've listened to it several times since getting it and I haven't found a single song on it that I don't like.  I know a lot of people might be disappointed that it's not as \\"dark\\" as the last album but in my view, this new set does a great job of keeping that Evanescence feel to it and still covers new territory. I mean after all, no one wants each album to sound alike otherwise what's the point of releasing new songs?
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|it seems to occasionally pin the cpu even when I am not using it. I had to freeze the app to stop it.

B005LJK3AC|2.0|Watched the preview, heard others rave about it, then decided to watch it.  Very disappointing.  If you like really crass humor then go for it.  I myself was very disappointed.  I would not watch it again.
0307279189|3.0|This is a very good book about ultra-marathoning.  The actual running prose is compelling.  However, the author repeatedly imposes fake drama and over the top personality traits to the characters, as if to attempt to make the book read like fiction.  It doesn't need this embellishment, which actually detracts from the book.  The Tarahumara angle is also very interesting, but not nearly as mysterious or prominent as the hype the author foists on the reader.  Still, a quite readable account of ultra long distance running and a worthwhile read.
067144901X|5.0|I read the wonderful reviews here on Amazon for Moo, Baa, LaLaLa and thought this would be a great book for me to read to my 3 month old son.  I didn't realize that it was a simplistic book about animal sounds, when I first read this to myself, I couldn't believe that I spent money on something so simple and why couldn't I just make Moo and Baa sounds to him.  Then I read it to him one night and made all the exaggerated animal sounds as possible and he loved it!  It's my go to book before bed (which is a difficult time) and it makes him smile through his frequent cries before bed while in his crib.  He doesn't yet look at the pictures, but loves the sounds.  I think this will be a book that he enjoys for many months.
B00000258J|5.0|... and I couldn't have chosen a better way to start!  This is blues at its finest.  \\"Mannish Boy\\" is a fine way to kick off this album, with the classic blues riff and Muddy's deep, rich voice.  Muddy is on fire throughout, and his band plays with confidence and good drive.  You can tell that they are tight and really into it.  One thing about Muddy that I really like is that he has the ability to move away from traditional blues but still keep it rough and interesting.  \\"Mannish Boy\\" is fairly standard, musically speaking, but later on in the album we get the painful feeling of \\"Bus Driver\\" and the upbeat, fun number \\"The Blues Had a Baby (And Named it Rock & Roll)\\".  Even though this album was recorded toward the end of Muddy's career, it still expresses his love and passion for the blues, and he sounds just as fresh as he did in his earlier days.  This is an essential album to own for any blues fan.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|While I've noted a lot of carping about compression, quality, etc., I have to say that this collection sounds wonderful (clear, full, etc.).  Don't let the audiophiles keep you from making a sound purchase.  A great set.  Long live Queen!
0756404738|5.0|I'm not a huge fantasy reader but I like the genre for mild action-adventure entertainment. That said these books are a cut above, crossing boundaries to become a great series. The characters are so well drawn, the writing is poetic, and the plot exciting making it a wonderful page turning read that is also fulfilling. Thanks, Patrick Rothfuss, for taking the time to craft such a wonderful character!
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|I am a BIG Lady Antebellum fan. Their first two CD's were brilliant. Overall, this one is good too; it just takes a few more listens than the others to really grow on you.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|There is so much about `Hanna' that shouldn't work, and yet it does; remarkably so.  The plot could have easily been clich&eacute;d and rather tired, and yet it feels youthful and modern.  The plot twists could have been predictable (and at times they are) and yet they feel necessary to the progression of the film.  There are depictions here that could have been deemed mere gimmick if handled poorly (especially the bookended scenes and specific phrasing) and yet they are dynamic in scope and wholly effective.<br /><br />There is so much `right' about this movie.<br /><br />`Hanna' tells of a young girl of sixteen who has been trained in isolation by her father to be an assassin.  She has trained her whole life to defend herself against the woman responsible for the death of her mother, the woman who would stop at nothing to end her life.  She has trained for the moment she would be ready to confront and kill this adversary.  When the film opens, Hanna is ready.  Once the switch is flipped (quite literally as well as figuratively) there is no turning back, and Hanna soon finds herself being sabotaged by an enemy smarter than she expected.<br /><br />A word of caution, `Hanna' is extremely violent, even for a PG-13.  The violence is also of a more disturbing nature, considering that the main proprietor of this violence is a young teenage girl.  To see Hanna snap a woman's neck and then shoot countless men in a single scene can be a bit much for some to watch.  The violence is never gory (although, the scene with the man hanging from the ceiling is a tad gruesome) but it is gratuitous and so one should be aware before committing to watching the film that it will be intense, and then some.<br /><br />For me, this film is the perfect amalgam of film arc-types.  It is an action film on the surface, a dramatic love story at the core and is beautifully glossed over with art house flare.<br /><br />I want Joe Wright to direct the next James Bond film.  I know that they decided to change directors with every new film because it adds a layer of individualism to each individual piece, but once Sam Mendes is done (another finely underrated director, so I'm pleased) can the reigns be handed over to Wright?  He shows such depth of cinematic viewpoint in `Hanna'.  The way he weaves emotional tones into the action, as well as the way he stages his scenes to play out like a beautiful painting; it's all so mesmerizing.  He captures action like a pro, but he never allows the action to take over the core themes of the film.  The score is to die for and the cinematography is delicious (especially that opening sequence).  Cate Blanchett may be a caricature, but she's an effective one.  Bana is superb (great accent work), I just wish he was used more.  I also loved seeing Tom Hollander (creepy, seductive, interesting) spice up the film, and young Jessica Barden is astonishingly effective as the `friend' Hanna develops in her travels.  She also has deft comedic timing, which is a raw asset she should cultivate.<br /><br />The girl is sharp.<br /><br />But there really is Saoirse Ronan, and no one else.  She is magnificent here.  Not only does she handle the physical aspect of the performance (the accent, the action scenes, the languages, the presence) but she captures the emotional trauma of the character as well.  She portrays such depth in her eyes, but she never betrays her character's innocence.  You never feel as though Hanna knows `too much', for she is always believably naïve, but she manages to get a slick handle on her character's more advanced education, the harsher grasp on her `emotional makeup'.  You never doubt her killer instincts, and yet she really wins you over when she begins to understand love and friendship.<br /><br />I can't wait to see this girl's future!<br /><br />So, despite the thematic issues (more from a moral standpoint and an obvious personal reaction) this is a film I highly recommend.  It is styled perfectly, and yetthe style never trumps substance.  This is a film you can drool over on all respects, for it is as visually stimulating as it is emotionally captivating.it is as visually stimulating as it is emotionally captivating.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|There is not one cut on this CD that isn't good!! This is a BRILLIANT 1st CD for this group!
B002ZFQD04|4.0|Loved the DVD but the audio CD quality was not up to par.could not hear vocals as itvwas drowned over by the bass and drums. Sounds like a mixing issue
B003UESJF6|5.0|My tahnks to AMAZON.COM for sending me this DVD in reord time! If my memory serves me correctly, I received this movie in 2 days after the date that I ordered it from Amazon.com! What spectacular service from Amazon or what? As an adult & Senior Citizen; I purchased the DVD for our granddaughter to watch along with me & my wife. It is not often that my wife and I sit down to watch an animation type DVD like Megamind! We(all 3 of us really enjoyed watching this movie as well as the extras included in this DVD)! I've taken a new stance on watching Animations; and I try to watch as many as I can even when my wife is not around the house. My wife and I raised 6 children who are all adults and married with children! My wife & have now have a total of 12 grandchildren ranging 1 year to 10 year old. Needless to say we have a number of grankids that want to spend the weeksends with their grands just about every weekend of the year! It's great to have movies such as MEGAMIND to show them when they come here for the wekend! So far 8 out of the 12 have seen the DVD and all have fully enjoyed watching this DVD as well as some of the others that we!! Our collection of DVD's like Megamind has grown exponentially!All of our grandchildren love our collection of animations including some of the 3D Animations that we have; all purchased from Amazon.com!!Our DVD collection has grown close to 900 DVD plus over 200 different movies from our satelite!
B000OJFV3S|4.0|WOW.  Just finished watching this on amazon prime instant video and loved it.  Yes, it's a bit graphic (sexually) from time to time, so I wouldn't watch it with my 15-yr-old (though I'm sure he's seen it all before).Terrific acting, Sam Neill in particular as the ambitious Cardinal Wollsley--but he was by no means two dimensional. Maria Doyle Kennedy is wonderful as Queen Catherine, a character who gets short shift most of the time in movies/shows about this period in history. The film does a great job of putting flesh on the bones of the infamous story of how England became Protestant due to the lust of its king and the plotting of the Boleyn family. Can't wait to see the subsequent seasons.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|For $0.99 this game is a must have for any old school rpg fan.  The story is a bit cliche, and the translation is a bit hit or miss but all in all it works.  My only major complaint is the battery use.  It seems to drain my battery at twice the rate of any other application I have use to date.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Convenient two-step single solution to getting a high quality signal out of a laptop.  I used these with a pair of Audio-Technica M50's, got great sound and no problems so far.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|EDIT:  I gots a new TV and I'm happy to say that audio FINALLY comes through.  So now, with my iMac connected to my receiver, I can blast Youtube videos through my two bookshelf speakers instead of the dinky little iMac speakers.  Hooray!<br /><br />ORIGINAL: I was hoping to make my TV with it's nice speakers pick up some of the audio slack left by the less than ideal built in speakers on my iMac, but no.  It wasn't meant to be.  So for those of you with a early 2011 iMac looking for some audio action to accompany your dual monitor action, look elsewhere.  Maybe it's my setup.  Whatever, the picture was easy enough to color calibrate to match acceptably.  Outside of the audio disappointment, it does the job.
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|I, like many parents on here had 2 children who absolutely loved the first \\"Cars\\" movie.  What made that first movie so magical is that it could appeal to all audiences and didn't rely on cheap thrills or gimmicks to sell the story.  In short, it had a timeless message all could relate to much like most of Pixar movies do.  That is why it is so disappointing to rate Cars 2 so low after how wonderful the first one performed.  In short, Cars 2 plays down to the complex themes associated in the first one and relies on shock value and action to carry the movie which, are at times, inappropriate and superficial.  While I appreciated their reverence for older spy movies, I don't think it is an appropriate theme to play off of for a children's movie.  Cars trying to kill other cars didn't sit well with me.  I also thought there was a lot more 'potty humor' which I think is okay to have at times but was overplayed in this movie as another cheap humor tactic.  This overall direction revealed the shallowness of the movie and as I watched it with my child I felt like this movie wasn't created to say something, but moreso to cash in off of the profit and popularity of the first.  Looking at the characters, the familiar faces you thought would be reappearing were mostly bit parts save for Lightning McQueen and Mater (who actually is more the star of this movie).  At the end of the day, the movie felt more like a 'straight to DVD' and it lost a lot of the heart most Pixar movies tend to have.  While I have some very strong criticism of this film, it needs to be said that the graphics of the movie were once again top notch and that themes about friendship, although feeling like an afterthought, had good intentions.  I liked the new characters they were trying to introduce.  In the end, Cars 2 is a movie that lost its message and got caught up in the height of the first one which results in a movie with some great flash, but not a lot of substance.
B003WMX3SY|4.0|I'll ditto all the positive comments already posted. I really like the case.  Lots of air circulation which some people would consider a negative if they're into the science of air flow in closed cases with fans. In my case, it's open and the fans keep the air moving over everything.  I chose the Corsair H80 cooling, replacing the stock fan on the back with the fans and radiator from Corsair.  Top mounts are great for an exhaust fan, but there's no grommet hole for the wires. I had to cut them and splice back once inside.<br /><br />My negative? I want to mount more 5.25\\" devices on the front. There's room, but you need additional rails which have been out of stock from Antec (the only source) for months now. I might have to break down and have some made for me.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hate reading books, I read this because the movie preview intrigued me. its great. read it. Its suspenseful, touching, and makes you question what you believe about survival, friendship, and love.
B000002UZ1|5.0|Fantastic collection, agreed. I just want fans to know that in some cases, what's on this disc is not the best version of the song.  First, perhaps my favourite `live' track of all time is `While My Guitar Gently Weeps' on George's `Live in Japan' (1992) CD-set. It features a more laid-back less-brittle sound than on the White Album, and has George and Eric Clapton `guitar-'duelling' during the extended finale. Much preferable to the original to my ears.  The version of `Don't Let Me Down' on `Let It Be...Naked' blends the two `live' performances of the song on the roof, and is rawer and gutsier than the single b-side version heard here. Actually, I prefer the un-retouched second take of the performance on the roof; in fact it is my favourite Beatles track, studio or live, period, but available only on bootleg unfortunately.  As for `Across the Universe', many fans will prefer the original version produced, as by George Martin to this one, re-produced by Phil Spector.   The `single' version of `Let It Be' presented here is the best rendition, except in one respect. The Harrison guitar solo on the version on `Let t Be...Naked' is perfection. (It's from the movie.) I just used rudimentary music-editing software to remove the merely adequate solo and replace it with the `Naked' solo. Now it's the best `Let It Be' that will ever be heard on this planet.  Same goes for `The Long and Winding Road'. Spector desecrated it. I personally can't stand to listen to his version at all and will never volunatrily listen through it again. The version on `Let It Be....Naked' (from the film, once again) is terrific, except that Paul toys with some of the words during the middle-eight, making that middle eight inferior to the basic track heard on the `Beatles Anthology III'. Solution: Remove the offending middle-eight from the `Naked' version and substitute the `Anthology' version's middle-eight. Sounds like a dream: no Lennon fumbling on bass, a more feistily-sung and correct middle-eight, and a nice childlike keyboard solo from Billy Preston. Finally, a recording worthy of one of Mac's most beautiful songs. It only took a third of a century to come about.
0425098478|5.0|No need to go on at length about what countless others before me have said; this book is great.  A bit expensive now, though, so I bought it used.  Read in one sitting.
B005F9CPG8|4.0|Granted this CD has been a great boon to the Beatles or their heirs, but for pre-existing fans, who needs it? It's easy enough to go through one's Beatles collection and pull off some number ones, if that's what turns you on. I mean, the whole rationale for this exercise was some genius at Apple realizing that all these number ones would just barely fit onto an 80-minute CD.  And, to cap off the Beatles' #1 hit-making career with the Phil Spectorization of `The Long and Winding Road' is like a tasteless April fool's joke, and come to think of it, the track WAS Spectorized (murdered) on April Fool's Day 1970. Great song--absolutely appalling over-production. I haven't been able to force myself to listen all the way through it in decades.   There's nothing sacrosanct about a number 1. Consider the following alternative list of great Beatles songs (in no particular order) that would easily match the contents of `1' for quality: I Am the Walrus, Drive My Car, I'm Down, Got to Get You Into My Life, With a Little Help from My Friends, Twist and Shout, A Day in the Life, Don't Let Me Down, Back in the USSR, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Here Comes the Sun, Taxman, Fool on the Hill, Please Please Me, Sgt. Pepper's Reprise, Rain, She's a Woman, Here There & Everywhere, Strawberry Fields Forever, Revolution, Blackbird, Norwegian Wood, In My Life, Yer Blues, Golden Slumbers/Carry That Eight/The End, Across the Universe. Hmmm...why hasn't Apple done a `critic's choice' Beatles compilation as a sequel to `1'?
B004TTMYQG|4.0|like using this calendar bc it syncs with Google calendar where my hubby &amp; I can keep track of our hectic travel schedules. However, I can't seem to find a place to keep times straight when i move time zones. ie: I schedule a 12pm lunch meeting in NY while on the west coast but when I go to the east coast it converts it to 3pm. should be an option to keep times standard
B004WJRF6C|4.0|To NOT release `Maybe I'm Amazed' as a single in the spring of 1970--what a missed opportunity for an Apple #1! The  track, with its barebones proto-punker zeal, was doubtless also a goad to Lennon's `Plastic Ono' LP later in the year. Anyways, here's an example of a solo Beatle doing what would definitely have become a Beatles track were the Beatles still intact, and likely doing it better than the band would have, or at least with a few desirable new wrinkles that an ensemble version might have ironed out.<br /><br />And, am I the only one who thinks that the guitar solo on `Maybe I'm Amazed', repeated and extended in the outro, is one of the great guitar solos for the ages? Paul did some great lead-guitar breaks with the Beatles--especially on `Taxman' nand `Good Morning Good Morning'--but this one is even better, because it's so emotionally driven.<br /><br />Any CD-R/iPod collection intending to put the Beatles back together again for the 1970-2010 era should appropriate from this album `Maybe I'm Amazed', `Every Night', `Hot as Sun' (faded before `Glasses' kicks in) and an early-faded version of `That Would Be Something'. (And onto the collections bonus sets go `Man We was Lonely', `Valentine Day', `The Lovely Linda', and `Junk'.) So there's lots of stuff on this album for those of us who interpret what happened to the Beatles after early 1970, selectively, as an extended final phase of their recording career.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|A great job on this one  i just wish he had a dance with the girl..  Chris did a great job on this one i hope he had fun I just hope they give him flying boots, so they can kick some serious butt in the second or third Avenger movie. he needs that to keep up with Thor and Ironman
B0000BVME4|5.0|Nobody had the Soul of Otis Redding. His phrasing is just amazing. Sundaze's re-issue just sounds great. The horns are wonderful. The snare just snaps on all the tracks.<br /><br />I think the previous review misses the point of Sundaze's re-isssue philosophy. It isn't to include extras. The point is the vinyl has been out of print for years. Those of us that are looking for a great sounding copy of the original issue on vinyl are rewarded by this re-issue.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Very good special effects, even better actors  I realy liked this one mosty Ryan's performance he got it spot on. I hope to see a sequeal  with the actor that played Senestro..
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This is far and away, above and beyond, the best Transformers movie, yet! If you're a Transformers fan, this is a must have. Outstanding special and visual effects. Excellent storyline. A most impressive film!
B000NQRE0K|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Glad we got it on blu-ray. It was worth it.
1451648537|4.0|I don't often find a biography that is so gripping that I can't put it down. But this book is one of them. I got a new perspective on high tech industry events of the last 20 years and am appreciative of the opportunity to learn more about who Steve Jobs was. On the down side, there are a few sections in the book where the author tells stories that he already told. And I found the closing chapter repetitive with what had already been said. Still, a highly recommended read.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I thought this was a fabulously hilarious film!  It is a quintessential British comedy, and I laughed from beginning to end.  The cast is amazing and each person adds their own wonderful dynamic to this dysfunctional family.  After reading some negative reviews, I think it is important to remind people that just because it is a comedy doesn't mean it will be universally liked.  I know many Americans who do not appreciate British humor and it is important to recognize, before watching the film, that the humor may not be what you are used to in America.  For example, any fan of the US version of the Office should watch the original UK version.  Though some elements are very similar, such as the stapler in the jell-o bit, there are also obvious differences.  Maybe British humor is not your thing, and if that's the case then I might steer clear of this movie.<br /><br />I think it is also important to realize that the film is rated R.  For those who are offended by the language, drug use, and very brief nudity...what did you not understand by \\"Rated R for language and drug content?\\"  If you are highly offended by swearing, namely the \\"f-word,\\" then don't watch.  It's that simple.<br /><br />But if you love to laugh, are not offended by some profanity, and enjoy slapstick comedy, then this film is for you!
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I have been playing this on my vizo tablet.<br /><br />It is addictive and a good mindless time waster (note this is not a bad thing); however ---<br /><br />Not sure if it is the game or my tablet but there are times that it just does not want to accept the swipe.<br /><br />Also the game is such that it is fix for a portrait play and does not rotate to a landscape view.<br /><br />Still a fun time waster...

1440503257|5.0|Pardon me for ripping off Lucky Charms in my title. A great deal of the food in this cookbook is fantastic! I especially love the meat pies, they're the perfect winter dish to be sure. It's fun to try a lot of the different recipes I've read about - especially when they come out tasting great. The recipes in the book are easy to follow along whether you're a beginner or an expert. If you love Harry Potter and you want to give some British specialties a chance, snag a copy of this for yourself.
0446547654|5.0|I mostly read Non-Fiction and write Religious Non-Fiction books. I first became acquainted with Nicholas Sparks when we went to the movie \\"The Notebook.\\" It has many similarities to my parents and I wanted to use some of the thoughts to illustrate a sermon that I was preparing, so I read the book. Since that time, my wife has started reading to me while we are driving between Southern CA and NE. She has read several of the Nicholas Sparks books to me in the last few years. We just finished \\"The Best of Me\\" on our last trip. The thing that I like about Nicholas Sparks is how real he makes both the characters and the story. So real in this book that we both felt emotionally drained by the end of the story. I highly recommend this book, but only if you are looking for a story in which you can become totally immersed.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|This movie Terminator 2 is for sure a classic and now 20 years old might still be the greatest sci fi movie ever made.  The action and suspense is incredible along with of course the sci fi effects.  By far still my favorite Terminator movie of the franchise and just seems like the movie never gets old.  I remember seeing it when it first came out in the early 90's saying was the greatest thing on TV I ever saw, and at the time for me it was.  You can see it played often on the basic cable channels and on some premium movie channels as well.  Unless you have been very busy or don't watch much tv and have not seen this movie be sure to do so and you will not regret it.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B005I64U5C|1.0|DO NOT purchase movies that advertise an \\"Ultra-Violet\\" digital copy. This is not a true digital copy and is deliberately misleading. I will never buy another DVD/BluRay that includes this pathetic sham of an offer.
B0013ND36G|4.0|Terminator 3 is no Terminator 2, but not too bad of a follow-up.  It would be hard to top T2 in terms of action and suspense but T3 does bring some pretty good material to the franchise.  Better than T. Salvation I thought, since it is hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger.  I would rate it my second favorite Terminator movie behind T2, with T1 of 1984 3rd and terminator salvation 4th.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0056BU3I2|5.0|no complaints....the movie is amazing.  the quality is great.  you wont be disappointed.  also has some great features if you have your blu ray player internet ready so make sure to check that out as well!
B001NY4X4G|5.0|For those who like legal and court dramas then this is a must see.  A great written movie with a lot of suspense, meaning and action.  I sometimes compare this movie somewhat to, 'a few good men' but not quite as high on the ladder, but much better than say 'fracture' or 'law abiding citizen'.  There is no crazy car chases, strange violence or bizarre horror scenes except maybe some blood at the beginning of the film.  The ending is so so and kind of leaves you wondering a little but is not too bad.  This movie should stay strong for a long time especially with it being Edward Norton's first ever movie.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0034G4P8A|5.0|quality movie, no complaints!  its crystal clear and came sooner than i thought!  i saw the movie at the theater but watching it on blu ray did it justice!  a definite go getter
B001FB55I0|2.0|I did not really like Termin. Salvation too much.  Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring.  There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me.  For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

0446573019|3.0|I've read all of Baldacci's books and have enjoyed them all.  Although this is a good story, Baldacci had better be paying Lee Child a royalty because this is clearly a Jack Reacher rip off.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I'm a life-long Rush fan and an audiophile. This is the fourth Rush DVD I've purchased and I'm FINALLY happy with the audio quality.  I'm running a new Yamaha 5.1 receiver, Polk 12\\" subwoofer & center speakers, Carver Amazing Loudspeakers for fronts and huge Pioneer \\"old school\\" speakers for rears. Needless to say, I would upset the neighbors if I wasn't hunkered down in my theater room downstairs.  If you want a Rush DVD to give you the \\"I was there\\" look and sound, this is it.  All the other Rush DVD's lacked true low-end bass, but not this one.   I'm only about an hour into it and can't wipe the cheese-eating grin off my face.   N-Joy!
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I was excited and a little worried about this one. All the hype about this movie saying \\"from the people that brought you Shaun of the Dead\\" always makes me nervous. I just think it's a cheap ploy to get people to see it. \\"From the people\\"...that could mean anything; a nobody writer, a producer, an actor etc etc. But this is the real deal. It's a delight from start to finish. It's part sci-fi part horror and part comedy. You can't help but cheer for the heroes. Even though their a gang of hoodlums made up of kids.
0385344325|2.0|This book is flashback from the other Jack Reacher novels.  Only either I don't remember correctly or old age is gaining on me but some of the timelines in this book seem incorrect from earlier books.  Also it seem like the author is tired of this story and just trying to turn out another book.  I would wait for this book to go to the discount bin.
B004TFLYRA|5.0|alex rider has come a long way, but now his journey ends. while it is sad to see such a great story come to an end, anthony horowitz`s long running series goes out with a bang in the form of a truly unforgettable tale that had me gripped until the very last page.

B004G6009K|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I had just as much fun as my 2 year old watching this movie.  The story flows well, is funny and quirky that adults enjoy it, and the music is fantastic.  Mandy Moor and Zachery Levi do such a great job together.  Love, love, love it!!
B00005JMJG|5.0|The title is captivating and the film lives up to its promise.  A smart, out-of-the box and funny script by Charlie Kaufman, a good director and dynamite performances make this both thought-provoking and greatly entertaining.  Jim Carrey, whose manic/zany performances turn me off, is brilliant here (as he was in The Truman Show).  He plays vulnerable so well, I'd like to see him do more of that.  The early scenes with him on the bus, wanting to talk to the girl, but terrified of actually doing it, are perfect.    Kate Winslett is always good.  Here her youthful joie de vivre makes an indelible impression on Joel, the Carrey character, and on the audience.  As Clementine, aka Tangerine, with her multicolored hair and quixotic personality she makes a perfect match to the shy introvert Joel.  A subplot, involving the employees of a company that erases troublesome memories works in its own bizarre way.  Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are all very good in their roles.   I got a little bored with the flashbacks to Joel's childhood, wanting Mommy to hold him, etc.  They were a little too literal for my taste.  But there was so much that was wonderful that I won't subtract a star from the rating.  Some of my favorite scenes:  -Carrey and Winslett playing in the snow at the beach.  Wow---how much fun was that?!  -The sheer zaniness of Dunst and Ruffalo dancing in their underwear over the sleeping body of Carrey as he's getting \\"the treatment.\\"  -The scene of Jim and Kate in the hall, near the end, when she confesses that she'll probably get bored with him and he says \\"OK\\" and she bursts into tears.  Whoa!  Cinema doesn't get much better than this---it reminds me of the emotional honesty of John Cassvetes' films.  I didn't care all that much for Kaufman's films, \\"Malkovich\\" and \\"Adaptation.\\"  I admired their cleverness but didn't really like them.  This has the same smartness but with a lot of heart and that's what makes the difference.  That's what makes this a film worth seeing, which I think will last for a long time.

Trying my best to have grandkids read it but not much luck.    maybe becoming workers was what this education system wanted all along.  the book is from the author's heart and is very good.
0393064476|5.0|The Swerve's primum movena is the arrival at a monastery in southern Germany in 1417 of Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, a papal secretary and devoted book hunter, laid off due to the arrest and excommunication of John XXIII. On a dusty shelf in the library Bracciolini finds a copy of On the Nature of Things by Lucretius, an avid believer in the school of Epicurus. The epic poem had gone missing for a thousand years. Greenblatt's preface tells us of his own accidental discovery of a copy of Lucretius' poem in a sale bin, which he bought for the Max Ernst cover for ten cents. Bracciolini had the poem copied, and thus the world swerved. Greenblatt read the poem, and thus The Swerve. Greenblatt's book is part quest, history lesson, and a peep at the biting, silly, boring and dangerous life of a secular scribe toiling away in a clerical setting. The Swerve is enthralling. The sinister intrigue of the curia in the 15th century, peppered with the poem's rediscovery and its impact on scientists, clergy and the Declaration of Independence is alive with funny and awful asides. Bruno's list of to-dos on Mercury's checklist is hysterical, but the price Bruno paid for his humor is horrific. Bracciolini is known today for his lovely handwriting, but his contribution to the world of philosophy is perhaps incalculable. At the heart of this book is the wondrous, compelling, and - to organized religion, heretical - philosophy of Epicurus and his poetic devotee Lucretius that fear is the enemy of life

B005J29HD0|5.0|\\"Smile\\" and vinyl go hand in hand.  We're talking 1966/67 of what should have been.  Bigger album, larger photos of the younger Beach Boys, cracks, nuances and the needle.  (The end to end inside cover of a black & white picture of \\"The Boys\\" confirmed that also purchasing the LP was instant gratification).  As a series of suites, the album sides allow for mini-breaks to better digest what Brian Wilson was trying to present.  This is not your \\"Fun,Fun,Fun,\\" outfit anymore.  \\"Smile\\" is rock, classical, jazz and intrumentals all in one.  Think of Gershwin/Mussorgsky/ELP more so than the beach sound and hot rods.  If you can get into it, it's a three sided spiritual masterpiece. (Note: Side four is bonus tracks).  Stop the comparisons to \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", the theme is rock symphonies.  Too advanced for its time or for most of the other members of the band.  Vinyl and mono is the way to go.  Same for \\"Pet Sounds\\".  That double tracking lead vocals on the stereo versions just doesn't come off as well. I agree the LP pressing is top notch. Using the less is more theory, hearing  the record on a regular basis I'm happy to end this project on the last song \\"Good Vibrations\\".  Practice sessions on the last side have their place only for how an album was originally put together and shouldn't be the final determining factor on the end result. Same for the CD releases.  For  multiple listens I prefer \\"Stack-O-Tracks\\" over all these stops and starts on the sessions because that album has a better flow of just instrumentals.  So in summary was \\"Smile\\" the greatest unreleased album of alltime?  Yes, if the true ending and bonus can put in a seperate context.  Capitol Records should do the casual fans a favor an release \\"Smile\\" in a single disc without any bonus material.
B001HN6922|5.0|As a parent of young kids, I was a bit worried based on the reviews of Cars 2.  I thought it was extremely well done and I enjoyed the 007/James Bond aspect of it.  They to manage the delicate balance of entertaining kids along with parents and I thought it was done quite well.  The details involved in the movie were amazing; I think you have to catch it a couple times to fully appreciate them.  It has been a top request at my house for movie night and I think we will get a ton of use out of this one.
B0000032LS|5.0|I recently went to a live production of the Rocky Horror Picture Show with my sisters in Minneapolis.  I loved the music as a young adult and had went to numerous midnight showings of the Rocky Horror Picture Show back in the day.  I had forgotten how much I loved this soundtrack and, after seeing the play, I decided to purchase it.  I listen to it regularly when I work out on my exercise bike.  Great blast from the past - makes me feel youthful again!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I do not give many albums 5 stars.  This album was a 5 star when it was first released and this newly remastered release is a 10.  The remaster is absolutely incredible.  It is like listening it to it for the first time.  I do not know who was responsible for the remaster, but whoever it is should be put in charge of all remastering.  Every song on this album is loud, crisp, and chilling.  Oringinally this album was one of the best rock albums of the 1970's and now once again it is one of the best of the 2010's. I need not go into a review of every song as we all know these songs very well, but I had to give a review for the album as a whole with the new remaster.  You have to have a copy of this \\"new\\" Aqualung! I think this is the album of the year. Hands down. I have not heard anything better than this album.
B001HN6922|4.0|The first Cars was great for kids and older kids (adults). There were great<br />characters, a good story, and many little things and some good lessons for all, in<br />other words its close to a classic.<br />The seconds Cars is different but still keeps enough juice from the first one to<br />bring it one step farther.  They took a subject that everybody knows a bit about<br />and made a bigger picture. You get more characters..you get a type of James Bond<br />film, great new locations and a lot of that crazy little guy called Matter. Sure<br />Matter can be a pest and take over a scene...but he is one of the glues of the<br />world of Cars.<br />This movie is made for older kids and then a bit for the kids also.<br />A keeper.

044654146X|5.0|This is a well written, well documented piece of literature based on the phenomenal people of \\"The Book,\\" and their ability to not only sustain all odds but to overcome all odds.

B004A8ZWWO|4.0|How can you go wrong with a movie that has a central premise in which Derek Zoolander, Ferris Bueller, Axel Foley and Precious rob Hawkeye from M*A*S*H*? Honestly, you can't. \\"Tower Heist\\" is what a movie with an ensemble cast is supposed to be. It is constantly interesting, always moving with twists and turns, a great script and laughs throughout that don't insult your intelligence.<br /><br />\\"Tower Heist\\" is about a group of employees that maintain, run and devote their lives to a collection of upper-crust socialites in a downtown Manhattan high-rise residence. At the top of this high-rise is Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who lives a life of spoil and wealth. Shaw can quite simply be compared to the likes of Bernie Madoff, which is another reason why this movie may hit home with some, and is most definitely a lot of the inspiration for the movie's plot. So when Shaw is exposed for milking people of their life savings and retirement funds, the employees of the Tower's lives come crashing down.<br /><br />\\"Tower Heist\\" has more entertainment value, fun and creativity than any of the newer \\"Oceans\\" movies and much of that comes from the band of unlikely misfits that choose to embark on a life of crime; the newly fired tower manager feels responsible, the wimpy divorcee who is being kicked from the tower with his new home, a box, in hand, the former BK (Burger King) employee and the expected father who has no money to support his coming family.<br /><br />\\"Heist\\" benefits from its ability to stay home and realistic. Even when things get crazy, the movie stays feasible and that is the most enjoyable thing about it. The creators could have gotten silly, like some of Stiller's movies, but they didn't. They kept things real and that made you feel like you could be in their shoes at anytime. Someday when your bottom falls out, you may have to resort to the same things.<br /><br />Also, remember when Eddie Murphy was funny? Like, really funny? I'm going to go all the way back to the late 80s with \\"Harlem Nights\\" and \\"Coming to America\\". Well, \\"Tower Heist\\" has `that' Eddie Murphy; the attitude Eddie Murphy and the change on a dime Eddie Murphy, the \\"banana in my tailpipe\\" Eddie Murphy.<br /><br />\\"Tower Heist\\" is a movie that will challenge your mind, make you laugh and give you a little bit taste of how it feels to stand up for yourself, even if we don't always get to do that in our own lives. At least we can watch a bunch of great comedians in a really good movie do it.ights\\" and \\"Coming to America\\".

0596805527|3.0|The proper use case for this book is that it be used as a comprehensive reference material.  I do not recommend that you use this book to learn JavaScript, especially if you're new to programming altogether.  As others have noted, it is highly detailed and includes every single caveat and nuance including browser bugs and workarounds.  The fact that David Flanagan is an authority on JavaScript and that this book is *the* definitive guide is not up for debate, IMO.  However, this material - its level of detail and its organization - is not conducive to learning, so I do not recommend this book for someone who is completely new.  Instead, find a book that provides practical, useful examples that you can put into action that immediately demonstrates core concepts and leave this book for your reference later on.  You *will* find this book useful as you get more experience but learning will be a painful process if you rely on this book to learn from.

My favorite is the chocolate cheesecake- it made my partner go from freaking out about me going vegan to thinking everything would be okay. There is also a ton of great advice; it was one of my first vegan cookbooks and still gets frequent use!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Overall I think this is a pretty simple summary for this album; if you're a Metallica fan you will hate this, if you're a fan of hard rock or 80's thrash you will hate this.  In fact I don't think many Lou Reed fans will like this either. I am a huge Metallica fan, I love all their albums yes even Load and ReLoad, and even think St. Anger has redeeming qualities. That said I can't get into this and find it to be an embarrassment from a production standpoint. For one, outside of a few repetitive snarls from Mr. Hetfield this album is completely devoid of any actual singing. Whatever it is Lou thinks he is doing it clearly can not be classified as singing. Now here is where I and Lou Reed fans will part ways; I honestly never thought the guy could sing in the first place, but what this album proves is that time has not been kind to his vocals. His \\"singing\\" could be confused with Karaoke night at a nursing home while someones grandson plays guitar and an asthmatic grandfather sings along. What this album actually ends up being is more of a gasping poetry rant from a man who clearly has nothing more to give to the music industry but seems intent on trying to stay relevant in  pop culture. Honestly I think its sad for a man who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to put out something this terrible, jokingly I think a class action law suit would hold water based on the simple principle that an album is supposed to have music and this really does not. I could go on with specific references on why this is so awful but just listen to tracks Pumping Blood, Dragon, Brandenburg Gate, as an final insult to your ears Mistress Dread. After that get a Que tip clean the remnants out and listen to Megadeth's new album while waiting for more actual Metallica music.
0446547654|4.0|Mediocre. Just so so. Read the same storyline time after time.<br /><br />Dawson and Amanda were high school sweethearts. Sweethearts never really meant to be. Dawson came from a long line of rule breakers and felons. Amanda came from a higher class family who was relieved when Amanda and Dawson stopped seeing each other.<br /><br />Both are drawn back to the town of Oriental, North Carolina when Tuck, an older gentleman that had befriended both of them passes away and requests they come and scatter his ashes.<br /><br />What happens ends up being a really intriguing book and a bit of a twist here and there. But we have seen this same ole line from Sparks over and over. Please think up something a bit different next time, please!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|There isn't much to say except that Steve Wilson's work on the Crimson catalog and now this Tull release would be living proof that you can make things from decades past sound BETTER. It is like a film has been stripped off the masters revealing the sheen. I cannot wait for someone to claim the original vinyl sounded better and how wrong it is to \\"mess\\" with that which is historic. :) Music, unlike historic paintings is still fluid when the multitracks are available. Sometimes it can be done better, and the technology of todays simply makes that possible.<br /><br />I am blown away by the difference, yet also by how Wilson remained true to the sprit of the original. The guitar has depth now and the instruments just sound better. GREAT JOB! I wish this guy was in charge of all prog rock remasterings.<br /><br />Wish they had packaged this with these two discs and one DVD of the surround. If you have good ears and listening sensiblilities you MUST have this.<br />GREAT!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Buyers beware!!  This is not a digital copy, but a \\"right to stream\\" copy from Warner Brothers via their new system called \\"Ultraviolet\\".  This system is full of bugs currently due to poor implementation.  You will have to register with Flixster and through Flixster create an Ultraviolet account.  This will let you STREAM your video via Flixster, but only if Flixster will talk to Ultraviolet.  My history with this comes from Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern where I could see the movies listed in Ultraviolet but kept getting an error from Flixster.  Warner Brothers (after several emails and a registered letter) finally emailed me a code to use with Itunes to get my digital copies as it WOULD NOT WORK through Ultraviolet.  Also keep in mind that Ultraviolet \\"digital\\" copies do not work with ITunes.  So if you purchased Deathly Hallows Part 1 and have it in ITunes, forget about having part 2 in ITunes unless you purchase the movie through that media.  You will not get it from purchasing the combo pack.  Ultraviolet is the worse thing I've seen for media management... and all because Warner Brothers refuses to negotiate with Apple to include their media in the ITunes media libraries.  Greedy Execs are hurting the end users so they can save a penny.    Know what you are buying before you buy it.  Boycott Warner Brothers for this horrible \\"digital\\" media (which it is not).
B0063ONP36|4.0|Supernatural is my favorite television show and by no means do I mean to put it down in any way. However, for the record, I would just like potential viewers who have not been to Lilydale, to know that none of this was actually shot in Lilydale, nor was it an accurate portrayal of it.<br /><br />Yes, there were some similarities, so, I can see that whoever wrote this either did their homework or visited Lilydale at one time. Yes, there is a cafe, which is a bit smaller and not quite as upscale as the one presented here. And yes, there is a museum, which actually looks quite similar to the one in this episode.<br />The biggest disappointment though, was the beginning scene, which showed Dean walking down a somewhat busy or populated street with signs hanging out in front of each shop. Lilydale is actually a small country type of town, with small country streets and houses the size of cottages, with only small wooden sign posts stuck in the ground in each front lawn with the person's name and talent written on them. No big signs or big streets here. Every porch has chairs, a table and notebook, for you to write your name down on it for an available reading time, unless you have an appointment, which can sometimes be made in advance online via email or phone.<br /><br />I don't know why I was excited to read about this episode, believing it would actually be shot in Lilydale because they never are really shoot in any of the places it says in the show. I learned that from the Dogs who turn into people episode, which was suppose to take place in Buffalo, NY, where I live, but it didn't. So, I should have known they wouldn't actually travel to Lilydale for this show, which would have been very cool. So, those interested in visiting Lilydale, please don't be let down by this episode.<br /><br />Also, this show portrayed Lilydale to be a community of fakes and dishonest people. While one person I have seen in Lilydale, left me somewhat skeptical, the rest were right on. The discussion of the Fox sisters was for the most part, the truth, but with different photos. But, even the psychics were aren't 100% accurate, aren't as obviously phony as this representation portrayed.<br /><br />This episode in itself was a great show like always. I just don't like the misrepresentation of Lilydale. I have been there many times and it looks and feels nothing like it was portrayed in this episode. Nor are most of the psychics and mediums fakes, like you are led to believe in this show. I once saw an amazing medium in lilydale, named Gretchen Clark. She has been in People magazine, interviewed on television and more. The information she gave me about my mom, was information no one could have known but my mother. Additionally, she mentioned about 10 dead relatives I've never met, which my father did verify as relatives. And no, I never ever gave her my last name or any other information.<br /><br /> Honestly, for a show titled, \\"Supernatural\\" you would think they would be a bit more open-minded about Psychics. It's easier to believe in Vampire's, Satan,and little dead boys in lakes than a psychic, really? I can't tell anyone what to believe or not believe, but I can say that my experiences in visiting Lilydale have been honorable. I love Supernatural, but, this was a poor portrayal of what Lilydale is really like. The show in itself, was very entertaining though, as always. So, those of you interested in Lilydale, please do your own homework and formulate an opinion of it based on something other than this episode. Still my favorite show though.as for the most part, the truth, but with different photos.

B005DKLPQ0|5.0|If you are looking at this collection, then I'll assume you already know the music.  The Smiths were one of the most important and original bands of the 80s, and it's about time all this great music was re-released.  They were immensely popular in England, and while they are known in the US, they never reached the level of success here that they deserved.  I guess that's hardly surprising.  This is a really nice collection that will replace my original CDs.  Does it have everything?  Probably not, they released a lot of stuff.  However, it's got most of what you need.  So, I'll limit this review to the remasters themselves.  I haven't gotten through all the CDs in this box yet, but those that I have listened to sound excellent.  Johnny Marr supervised the remastering, and did a great job.  These CDs are not overly loud or brick-walled like some newer discs.  The levels are a bit higher than the originals, but in a good way.  If there is any difference in the applied compression then it was done correctly and musically.  I had the original vinyl and the original CD versions of most of these albums, and IMO the remasters here offer a significant improvement in sound quality across the board, especially on a good system.    I also think the packaging is clever and effective.  Each CD is contained in a miniature version of the original cardboard outer album sleeve, accurate right down to the stickers on the front and free poster included with \\"Rank\\".  The cool thing is that the inside album sleeves are also included.  So, the CD is inside a more slippery inner paper sleeve printed like the original, and then that fits in the outer cardboard sleeve, just like a vinyl album.  I hate CDs that come in just a cardboard sleeve because they are difficult to get in and out without getting fingerprints all over them, and I generally have to put them in a separate jewel case.  However, the inner paper album sleeves that come with these are very easy to get the CD in and out of, and then these slide right into the cardboard outer sleeve.  So, the packaging is fun, compact, and easy to use, without the constant fuss to avoid smudges like normal cardboard sleeves.   So, overall this is a must-have for the Smith's fan, even if you have the original CDs.  The price is pretty low for all that you get, and the remastered versions sound great.  Don't wait too long - good stuff like this seems to disappear way too quickly these days to make room for more awful, syntho-dance crap.
B0052WSX32|5.0|This surprise comeback album from Doris Day is a stunner, a mix of old and new material that could not possibly fail to please fans.
B0002858YS|4.0|I mainly listen to older alternative and post-punk music from the 70s and 80s, and I am not impressed by that many newer bands.  However, the Killers definitely impress me.  This is a great album that stands up to many of the classics from that earlier period, but I wouldn't call it retro.  They are clearly influenced by the greats from the previous generation, but they still have a modern sound, and more importantly, have their own sound.  They are hard-edged, but still have great hooks and melodies, like the Jam or old U2 (not that they sound like either one).  As great as the music is on the CD, the recording and production quality is so bad that it's actually distracting from the music IMO.  The first three tracks are almost painful to listen to a on decent system, and the rest are not much better.  Everything is distorted - the vocals are distorted, the bass is distorted, the drums are distorted, etc.  Either this was recorded on a 25-year-old cassette boom-box, or the engineer is deaf.  Unfortunately, it's probably the work of another misguided producer trying to make it sound more \\"analog\\", in which case it's clear that no one involved has ever actually heard a decent analog recording.  Contrary to current popular belief, analog does not equal distortion!    I suppose if most people just listen to this on their iPod cranked-up to the point where it's distorting anyway, maybe they don't notice.  IMO though, the bad recording is not doing the great music here any justice, and is actually detracting from it.  Keep in mind, I listen to old, low-budget alternative and punk recordings from 30+ years ago, so I'm not being a picky audiophile looking for perfection here!  However, there's really no reason for a major 2005 release to sound like something recorded on a 4-track in someone's garage in 1977.  So, to sum up:  A definite 5-stars for the music, but -1 stars for the really terrible production.  If the overly distorted sound was a creative choice, it was a badone.  I'm looking to buy a Killers live CD in the hopes that these songs are better to listen to on it.
030788743X|5.0|I caught a review of this book in Entertainment Weekly, and was immediately intrigued by the excerpts that seemed to dig from the culture of my childhood, such as Superfriends and Back to the Future (I was born in the 80s). Typically I feel that EW's reviews aren't that well researched, credible, or otherwise useful for anything other than a laugh, but that's a story for another day. Long story short, they were right on this one.  Backstory (Spoiler free!): Basically, it's a not too distant future, where the world is ravaged by a myriad of man-made problems, and humanity is dying off slowly. Since the world sucks so bad, they spend almost all their free time in a Virtual Reality called the OASIS. It has everything you could possibly want, split into a literal virtual universe: entertainment, education, social settings, even planets with the OASIS that are just recreations of a person's hometown that they can hang out in if they want to live in nostalgia.  The creator of the OASIS, and the richest man on Earth, James Halliday, dies. On the day of his death, he releases a video discussing the first \\"easter egg\\" ever found in a game, and how he planted one of his own inside his greatest game... the OASIS itself. Whoever finds this egg in his game... inherits his entire fortune, and the entire OASIS. Needless to say, the search for his easter egg quickly becomes the biggest contest in the history of mankind.  The story centers around a teenage kid in Oklahoma, Wade Watts, and his quest to find this easter egg. Along the way, he makes friends, and tons of enemies all looking to score the egg first.  The real brilliance of this book, I think, and its true calling card, is not only how it's chock full of geeky references, mostly from the 80s (but there's plenty of more modern stuff thrown in too), but how brilliantly the justification for all the references to Heathers, Family Ties, Ally Sheedy, Peter Gabriel, etc are woven into the story. Basically, James Halliday was obsessed with the era in which he grew up as a kid (the 80s, of course). So naturally, when he dies and promises all his fortune to anyone who can figure out his game within a game, it becomes everyone in the world's business to learn and appreciate the pop culture that he loved so much, if only to try and figure out clues where his easter egg is hidden. So you have people referencing and obsessing over movies, TV shows, and music from the 80s, when the real world setting is somewhere in the 2050s.  And it works. Seamlessly. It's fantastic. It gives the author a way to regale us with his amazing knowledge of geek culture, without making the story feel like an afterthought. And trust me, there's plenty to like in the actual story too. There's plenty of action (both of the virtual and real world variety), and even a bit of a heist in the middle that was well crafted. I was riveted the whole time, and honestly, it felt a lot shorter than the 350ish pages it weighs in at. Which is a good thing. Though for some reason, I had the voice of Curtis Armstrong (Booger from Revenge of the Nerds, and a billion other movies and shows) in my head for the protagonist. Not exactly sure why, but I'm sure the author wouldn't mind that comparison.  But seriously.

1451648537|4.0|That's the first line of Mona Simpson's novel, [[ASIN:0679772715 A Regular Guy]]. The regular guy character is based on Simpson's brother, Steve Jobs. Although they didn't grow up together, they got to know each other as adults. To biographer Walter Isaacson's credit, he refused to investigate whether the opening line is based on truth or is a fiction writer's imagination at work. It's enough that it could be true, that it's believable. Because that is exactly the kind of guy Steve Jobs was.<br /><br />After reading the first half of Steve Jobs, I had to take a break from the book for a day. I was sick of Steve Jobs and his tantrums, his gigantic ego, and overwhelming presence. But I couldn't resist reading the rest after a break, it was just too fascinating, too irresistible.<br /><br />Isaacson did a great job describing what was contradictory and infuriating about Jobs. He also explained Jobs's obsession with design and his dedication to the principles of zen and simplicity. But he was less proficient at explaining why people who were seriously mistreated by Jobs, repeatedly and publicly, continued to be loyal to him. Not everyone was a fan, but enough people were that there had to be some quality that made it worth it for them to put up with his neglect, rudeness, and verbal abuse.<br /><br />The best Isaacson could come up with were lukewarm defenses that excuse a \\"genius\\" for bad behavior. I did have to give Jobs credit when I read that he refused to have security guards for his family and lived in a normal sized house in a nice but not exclusive neighborhood, that he preferred to live a simple life even with all his wealth, that he didn't own a plane or a yacht. For all his sharp edges, at least he wasn't a hypocrite.<br /><br />He seemed to mellow just a little after he was diagnosed with cancer, but he decided to throw his remaining energy into his company rather than his family. Realizing he owed them more, his answer was to outsource the task of explaining why he hadn't been around for them to a professional biographer writing a book that millions of people would read.<br /><br />There was even a surprise ending. By the end of the book, Jobs owned a jet and a yacht.to a professional biographer writing a book that millions of people would read.  There was even a surprise ending.

This is a slap in the face of legal media purchasers, and will only increase pirating.

B005Q1W10A|4.0|Considered one of the most successful \\"darlings\\" in the history of television, the first season of Downton Abbey achieved international success and a worldwide following. Its second season includes the same likable (and some not so likable) characters, but in an entirely new world...  When last we left Downton, the house was in turmoil at the recent news that war has begun with Germany. Some time later, the inhabitants of the great old estate have seen their lives immensely changed. Robert (Hugh Bonneville) feels inadequate and wants greatly to once more go to battle rather than staying at home and raising the morale of the women, and his wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) is too distracted to take much notice of his melancholy mood. Each of his daughters have embarked on individual quests to be of some use: Mary (Michelle Dockery) is both pining and praying for her beloved Matthew (Dan Stevens) at the front, Edith (Laura Carmichael) is learning to drive a tractor (among other things), and Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) is hoping to become a nurse at the local hospital.  Downstairs, Carson (Jim Carter) is attempting to contend with a limited staff and even scarcer resources. Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) is confronted with the antics and perils of a brand new maid with ideas above her station, and the would-be-romance between Anna (Joan Froggatt) and Bates (Brendan Coyle) is put on temporary hold when his wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy) arrives with a startling proposition.  While each of the characters confronts their fears and struggles to find a way to fit into a world that is altering all around them, the second season powers forward with purpose and sentimentality... although it does sometimes stray into convenient clichés and predictable outcomes. One of the more remarkable things about it is how this series manages to involve us so completely in the lives of its many protagonists, whether we love or hate them, find them irritating or are frustrated with their bad choices. This season finds a dramatic change in Lady Mary for the better, makes us feel sorry for Thomas (I never thought it possible!), and invokes tears of both joy and sorrow as each installment comes to a close. The writing is sometimes magnificent and sometimes subpar, its main problem in moving too quickly through situations (in some instances, I would have advocated slowing down) and not permitting the audience to really spend much time on some of the romantic relationships. It also on occasion suffers from \\"telling\\" rather than \\"showing,\\" which is a shame. Some moments are very, very good (such as an attempted assassination, the return of a missing soldier, and the final ten minutes of the finale) while others are downright cringe-worthy - Mrs. Bates in particular is too conveniently evil for my taste.     Season two has taken a lot of heat from critics and audiences alike for its predictable storylines and rampant clichés. Much of this criticism is deserved, since while some of the character development is believable (such as the transformations of Mary and Edith) other departures are completely unexpected and unlikely. The series hits all the right emotional notes but doesn't quite have the spark of its predecessor. Gone are all the wonderful conversations and moments that were used to build character and humor and forthright plot-driven exposition is in its place. Even so, there are some terrific one-liners from Maggie Smith and the happy ending to one couple's crisis is more than enough to redeem any of its mistakes.

0812992792|5.0|Adam Johnson writes with authority about the essentially unknown North Korean culture and civilization. Kim Jong il's force-fed propaganda controls the people so consummately that their identities are squeezed from their minds and replaced with a state-sponsored life and perspective. The life of a North Korean is not the pursuit of happiness or self-actualization. It is solely to survive, like an insect or a rodent. To live, you must become a shell, an unquestionably loyal nationalist.<br /><br />What Johnson realizes so well in his debut novel are the conflicts, confrontations, and abysses between the self that has been annihilated and the social structure that replaces the self. Every word you utter is weighed, and could be twisted as subversive. You are subjected to daily propaganda reports through loudspeakers connected to your home. People are traumatized from the cradle to the grave, and your individual thoughts are a threat to your security and safety. You are raised to be a complete subject of the state, and to wear the skin of trauma that is inflicted daily.<br /><br />Jun Do is a survivor of famine and abandonment. His father ran an orphanage, and Jun Do was expected to impersonate an orphan from an early age. His strength, talents, and stamina lead him along an epic path. From his high seas and espionage adventures on a fishing vessel, where he develops his first chosen father-son emotional relationship, to the deprivations and torture of the prison mines, to the corrupt corridors of power, where his skill of impersonation becomes his sword and precarious shield, Jun Do's life literally morphs into a fabled one.  He learns to act alone, and yet to connect with the hearts of others.<br /><br />\\"Today, tomorrow...A day is nothing. A day is just a match you strike after the ten thousand matches before it have gone out,\\" says the tragic, beautifully wounded actress, Sun Moon, who has made persona an art, and who once captured the hearts of all the citizens, including her husband, Commander Ga. Jun Do's transformations, internal and external, bring him squarely into the receptacles of Commander Ga, Sun Moon, and the \\"Dear Leader\\" himself.<br /><br />This postmodern novel is told via stunning juxtapositions, between the controllers and subjects of a treacherous society and the inner will of the individual. The historical context is authentic, complex, layered, and detailed. Chapters alternate between Jun Do and a nameless interrogator, which progress to an operatic denouement. This isn't the kind of novel that grabs you immediately; there are many ambiguities and inchoate events that build gradually, stone by stone, erecting an explosive story that tunnels through the doom of a raw reality, to a bloodletting dystopian myth, and into the chambers of a sequestered heart.ncluding her husband, Commander Ga.

B005K8QIS0|5.0|Case Histories, a British mini-series, just wrapped up on \\"Masterpiece Mystery\\" on television.  This new adaptation of Kate Atkinson's work, starring Jason Isaacs as private detective Jackson Brodie, is excellent.  I've read all four of Atkinson's Brodie novels and really enjoyed them, so I was fairly excited to see this program and wondered if they'd do a good job.  Didn't have to worry.<br /><br />As one reviewer noted, any TV show that has the smarts to cast the underrated and underused Isaacs is worth checking out; this one also has good writing and great casting of all the other actors going for it too.  I thought the writers did an excellent job of paring down Atkinson's novels for television - cutting out unnecessary plot lines and characters to streamline the story and make it work quite well, at least for me.  I watched the show with my husband, who hasn't read the books, and he felt everything made sense and really enjoyed the program.  I remember while I read the books that there were parts I felt were unneeded, which are the same parts the writers took out.<br /><br />The main thrust of the story is that Brodie, ex-military and police officer, now private detective, gets involved in various investigations, some of which are connected.  Each episode has 3 cases in it.  As some reviewers have commented, there is a certain amount of coincidence in the cases being connected, but this may not bother some people (it doesn't bother me that much).  And some of the changes in the plot lines from book to TV show were necessary for clarity and time concerns, so an incident that seems more random in the book is a bit manipulated on TV.  There are also a couple of major plot lines that are completely missing from the TV version, but their exclusion is necessary to create a simpler and clearer story.<br /><br />What's great about the series is the acting - from the main characters to the minor ones.  Brodie's assistant Deborah and his daughter Marlee are especially memorable, as is Reggie from the third installment.  Isaacs is perfect as Brodie, capturing both the hard-boiled detective and the loving father with equal ease.  It's nice to see him playing a real person, rather than a plot-catalyst bad guy or bad-guy sidekick.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys quality drama for grownups; be aware there's some cussing and a little sex here and there.morable, as is Reggie from the third installment.

Main goal is to try and prove to pre teen and teen kids, and husband, that vegan food can taste good.<br /><br />I've been reading all of Issa's books, and I love her style - I am new to veganism, so learning, and she is very good at explaining the whys and hows of the different ingredients, and how things work together to produce the, hopefully delicious, end result.<br /><br />I tried my first recipe over the weekend - basic chocolate cup cakes.  As I was putting the ingredients together, I did think,<br />\\"Wow, that's a lot of vanilla and almond essences,\\" but I went ahead and did what I was told.<br /><br />I made butterfly cup cakes out of them, and they looked beautiful.  My husband and I declared them delicious - soft, yummy, very crumbly when fresh, but firmed up to perfection by the second day, and we scarfed them down.  The children, however, had a different reaction.  They did not like them at all!!!  Now, find me a kid who doesn't like chocolate cake!!!  I think it was that the almond and vanilla essence/flavors were too strong and not a usual taste for them.  So, I will try them again without the flavorings and see what happens!<br /><br />Update:<br />Made the chocolate cup cakes and omitted the almond essence, and they were gone in 2 minutes.  Kids loved them.  So, almond essence is out.  Will try something else next!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Unlike most of its peers, this film isn't as overdone with endless fighting and chasing, though there is plenty of that here. Instead, because it has to have some plausibility as being set during WW2, the effects here are not as headache-inducing. Yes, it has the usual evil-genius plot we would expect, but it also delivers some male bonding storyline, and a somewhat cliched strong-female love interest to relieve the hardware fantasy show. If you haven't seen how this fits into the grand scheme, you will still enjoy because the movie stands alone.
1442346949|3.0|Steve Jobs' vision, intensity, focus, and dedication to his own version of perfection is worth understanding and serves as great example to all generations on entrepreneurs.    His commitment and perseverance should be a standard for all CEOs who too often gets swayed by Wall Street and its pressures.  This biography provides a good window into some of this impactful life, however, even if you didn't know the name of the writer, you'd know it was a writer from the \\"Time\\" or \\"Life\\" school of writing, . . . bland and not profoundly insightful.   It isn't because Isaacson isn't familiar with technology, but that he doesn't seem to have the inquisitive mind necessary to do Steve Jobs justice. To his credit, Isaacson allows his subject, and those he interviewed, ample room within quotation marks. Since Jobs didn't ask to 'edit' the manuscript, there is a definite sense of authenticity to this biography.  BTW, Jobs presciently and correctly placed much emphasis on the education market in '80 to '83, which is what sustained Apple through those years, . . . there's no mention of it at all.  Apple Logo (the programming language) played a major role in the penetration of that market by Apple, and it's creator, Logo Computer Systems Inc, was an important partner in the effort.   It's importance was underlined by the fact that it was the only company to ever be given the right to use the Apple Name and Logo on its product packaging and documentation. Given Steve's and Apple's very tight reigns on all of it intellectual property, that was a unique event in its history.

Even when you do you best just to survive, there are powers beyond your control to put you in your place.

A world where time works against you, and you need strong alliances, even if they might stab you in the back. How can Peeta and Katniss both survive again, will Katniss sacrifice herself to save the boy that would do anything for her? Will he survive long enough for her to need to make the decision.<br /><br />In order not to spoil anything... Just read the book.<br /><br />Warning though... Have book 3 ready, so when you finish book 2 you are not left hanging.

B005FITIDC|5.0|I have seen Machine Gun Preacher, though it was not easy to do so in the US, due to the lousy PR efforts by Relativity Media (its head, Ryan Cavanaugh is allegedly a friend of Gerard's).  I recommend it, as it is probably Butler's best  performance to date.  He is an emotional guy, and it shows always, even in lackluster films like The Bounty Hunter.  Here, we see what he can do.  The film itself suffers from being too much story for one film but it is a fascinating take on a true story of a man who is willing to be a warrior missionary, not a peace loving missionary.   He comes across as a violent man, a biker criminal who learns to take that violence and refocus it.  You get the impression here is a man, who, in his early life, would have smashed anyone in his way.  You do not have to agree with his approach as a missionary, but just understand that it was that or totally retreat from his work in the Sudan.  The warlord involved in the Sudan is still there, and still killing, and the US government has sent 100 military \\"aides\\" to help the new government there stop this warlord.    See the film on DVD and decide for yourself if Sam Childers (the biker) was right or wrong.
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|i agree with the reviewer that said that in parts lou sounds like a old man with dementia that stumbled in to a metallica jam session.in fact in some parts he sounds like captain beefheart and some parts this sounds like the bizzare timothy leary LSD album from 1996,which itself is something else.however...LULUs first song brandenburg gate i found unbelivably awesome...sounds like something that could have been on the berlin album.the view,cheat on me and junior dad were also pretty fantastic.but....the problem with this whole undertaking is when it gets bad....it gets unbearably bad,unlistenably bad,turn down the volume bad.i don't know what lou was thinking with some of these lyrics,but they just sound almost laughable.

B0054TKBBA|5.0|Because it was being produced by MTV, I was expecting a super sexed up show but to my surprise this show was rather tame for MTV standards.  There's a good mix of horror mixed with the teenage drama that make this show likeable.  However unlike other teen monster shows, this teenage show doesn't overpower the horror storyline.  What caught me most by surprise was the wit of one of the character's who happens to be the werewolf's nerdy sidekick. The duo made quite an entertaining pair to watch week after week.  My only fear is this show ends up becoming muddle with teenage drama and less about supernatural horror but so far I am greatly looking forward to the second season.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|another keeper in the Transformer series... hope to see follow  ons continue. amazing special effects and graphics. keep me  locked on the screen for the enter movie
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I can't decided whether I really liked this book based on the story itself, or because of the amazing descriptive writing by the author.  Either way, I did enjoy this book! I hate to say it, but the story almost became secondary to me. I loved reading about the bizarre circus with the tents, the attractions and the people there. And the clothes, the parties etc.   I'm not usually a fan of very (overly?) descriptive writing, but here it absolutely shines.  You can't help but envision exactly what the author is wanting you to see.

0380789019|5.0|O.K., so here's the plan. Start with Mieville's \\"Un  Lun Dun\\".  Then move on to Gaiman's  \\"Neverwhere\\".  Then advance to Simon R. Green's Nightside books, (say, \\"Something From the Nightside\\").<br /><br />  That way you can have a lot of fun with how cleverly Mieville lays his alternate London right over the top of \\"real\\" London. Enjoy the zest and unruly imagination of a deeply original writer.<br /><br />  Then compare with the almost stately, restrained elegance of Gaiman's approach to alternate-London.  Gaiman's imagination is just boundless, and every page is infused with his great sense of place, and his deft touch. Sure the book is \\"dark\\", but only in a thrilling sense, not the world weary, or ironic, or hopeless style of many current writers.<br /><br />  For a change-up go to the Nightside of London, with the noirish, tongue-in-cheek, and much more fantastical Green.<br /><br />  Really, what a trifecta.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is wonderful. My favorite sound to fall asleep to is 'Rainy Drive' which is a soothing sound of a realistic car drive in the rain complete with windshield wipers, rain, and the occasional car passing by. I set it for 45 mins and fall asleep before the time is up. I use it every night. My other top sounds are wind, and urban noise. Recommend it for anyone who needs background noise to sleep or for those times that you just need to hear noise. Some sounds are very loud and startling so keep it kinda low when testing all of the new sounds if you're easily startled ;) The volume that works best for me with 'Rainy Drive' is 57%.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|My wife and I had this movie previously but it was stolen last Christmas along with four others, it was a must have so we purchased it again. I keep it with our Christmas movies, it is a fave.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I like it and use it often. Lots of Chicago stations are 'restricted by the broadcaster' but I guess it's not the worst thing since it will direct you to a station just like it. I've never been one who liked to listen to music on my phone though so I really don't even listen to music much with this app. What I really use it for is to listen to the local police scanner while I surf the web. I don't know if it happens to everyone, but it does seem to randomly stop and I'll check it and have to press the play button again and have to wait for it to buffer and start again. It messes up about 4 times per listening session. Kinda drains my battery too after a while. Love the app though and recommend it.
B0020EK4QY|5.0|Excellent movie- I had to upgrade from the DVD.    Sound is impressive.  The visual effects could have been a little better- mainly in the jet dogfighting scenes.
B00000IQV7|5.0|I told the lady that I walk with that I had purchased this movie. She told me that I would laugh and cry and that it is a great film. She was right! Unfortunately, I have spent some time in the hospital years ago and I only hope that the doctors were as good to me as Patch Adams was to his patients. That is exactly what we need! More doctors like him. This is only my opinion though.
