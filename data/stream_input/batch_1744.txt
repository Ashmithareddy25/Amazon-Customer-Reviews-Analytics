1602836582|4.0|The BBC adaptation of this Le Carre classic is superb. The music, accomplished actors & actresses and not over-done sound effects make listening to this CD very near to being at a theatrical performance. Le Carre's skills shine: characters to cheer for and against, the hope for the happy ending, historical context. This masterpiece of the psychological spy thriller is unmatched.<br />There was a glitch on Disc 2 that interfered with some dialogue for a few seconds, which was unfortunate, but didn't ruin the overall product.
0545265355|5.0|Great trilogy for Tweens, teens and adults alike.  Would thoroughly recommend this as a must read before seeing the film

0385333846|5.0|I find the way it zips around in time to be exactly how my mind works, now that I'm over 60...  I often can't remember which jacket to look for -- mixing up memories of jackets from years back, for example.<br /><br />Am I approaching Alzheimer's?  I know they tend to remember past events more clearly than recent ones -- which is how this book is, as well.  I don't think that was understood yet when he wrote it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great writing, story and character development, with fabulous twists and turns right until the very end!  It begs the question - how much does family history chart our future?
0142001104|5.0|It did not occur to me to read a book written by a musical conductor until Zander was interviewed in a Spanish channel; while he was visiting Mexico.  During the interview Zander talked about his book and the art of possibility. I was fascinated about what he had to say. Also, I was able to witness the work he did with a group of young Mexican students. As an educator, I learned some tips on how to relate to my own students. But, it was during the time he spent teaching music to the students that I was able to understand what the book was about. Therefore, I recommend it to all readers because it helps you learn how to connect to others.
B0086700CM|5.0|I avoided this game for awhile.  I thought it was something different.  Then one day I just decided to give it a try.  I enjoyed from the first try.  Then my 3 yr old granddaughter tried it and she is hooked big time.  She asks for my Kindle as soon as she wakes up.  She'll play this game for hours.  And she's gotten very good at it.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|this is a good game to play when you have time to waste. I use it when I am waiting for my car oil change or other appointments, but fun to play.

B007WKEM8C|5.0|Brilliant book. Beautiful photography. a<br />And I now have a list of recipes I want to cook from this book. I purchased both the print and the kindle versions of this book and I have to say, for sheer viewing pleasure, the print version wins.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I listened to this on audiobook, if I had a paper version this would have been a DNR for me.  My sister liked it, more for the history aspect, but 20 disks and not much happens.  Blah, blah, blah all talk and no action.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I was surprised that an infant Gerard Butler was the Phantom and the daughter from Shameless was Christine -- and equally surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this.  Yes, the singing isn't perfect - - perfection is over-rated.  The acting makes this version outstanding.  I truly enjoyed this one.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|What a great read!<br />Still having a hard time thinking of Tom Cruise as Reacher for the movie.<br />I would Highly recommend this book
B002PMPTIO|4.0|I chose this rating because it brought back one of the lead characters, Spock Prime. (Leonard Nimoy.) It was indeed a  \\"time warp\\", back to the future-istic. It reminded me of when we used to watch the series and tied up lots of loose ends...<br /><br />I cannot think of anything I disliked. Except maybe it should have been longer???<br /><br />I have recommended the movie to my brother, as we were all \\"trekkies\\" back in the day.....
B007HACDLK|3.0|This book just didn't grab me like the rest of Lee Childs &#34;Reacher&#34; books<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone there are too many other better books out there in my opinion.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read most of his books and everything with John Corey .<br />This is one of his best yet!!<br />What a great read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Caveat: I only read about 30 pages before giving up on this book. The only reason I bought it at all was that my book club was reading it. I thought that the writing was horrid and the characters were completely unlikable.  I actually disliked the male character, Gray, so intensely that I stopped reading the book. There was nothing redeeming about this book in the first 30 pages and I am really not a hard person to please and am not snobby about the books I read at all.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Loved this book. He has a unique writing style and the story is so intricate and fascinating that I couldn't put it down!

B006H5120E|2.0|I received my 3D Bluray of Titanic today. Apparently someone didn't care how it was shipped. Usually I get my movies in a box and they are well protected. This copy had a corner of the bluray case cracked and some of the plastic fell off the corner when I removed the plastic wrap. You guys have been great in the past but I noticed this with a couple of movies I have ordered. This is the first time I am commenting on a damaged item. If this continues to happen I will return the damaged item and go back to buying movies in a brick and mortar store where I can insure they are not damaged.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Oldie but a goodie.  It was easy and convient to watch this over the internet on TV w/ kids.  I won't rate the movie as there are  million reviews already
B0061S073A|5.0|Keeps my kindle and kids safe. No problems and best of all the app is free and very easy to use.
B009FB3XTA|3.0|Not a bad soundtrack, though I only really like two tracks (\\"Speak Up\\" and \\"Ghosts\\"). The last track, by Carter Burwell, is horribly edited and ends the album on a very lackluster note. I agree with the other reviewers that there should've been more uplifting tracks, or at least all the lighter tracks should've been sequenced better throughout the album rather than just at the start. Oh, well, I'm no record producer. What do I know?
B002SR2PKG|5.0|The only Stephen King book better than this one is The Stand!  This is two story's in one, but with the same characters. I have read it about 8 times
0446580848|4.0|We have mixed feelings about DeMille's latest, \\"The Panther.\\"  For sure, at 625 pages, it was way too long - lots of the roughly 90 chapters did little or nothing to advance the plot.  At 400 pages, we would have had just as good a story with more suspense and way less filler.  The gist of this tale is that John Corey, detective on the NYPD Anti-Terrorist Force and featured in five of the author's  previous novels, is assigned with wife FBI Agent Kate Mayfield to go to Yemen to attempt to snuff out the Al Qaeda principal responsible for the bombing (several years ago) of the USS Cole and the deaths of nearly 20 US servicemen aboard.  Most of the story is narrated by Corey, who we will admit is quick with witty repartee, but eventually that gets repetitive and tiresome.  Moreover, his wife Kate's role was so minimal, that other than using her to highlight the discrimination against women in a typical Moslem country like Yemen, she could have just as well stayed home as far as her consequence to the plot.<br /><br />What did complicate the plot were the several players on the team chasing the bad guy, headed by a CIA guy that Corey never trusted from the beginning, and as it turned out, with good reason.  That was perhaps the most intricate part of the story and one with a most satisfying resolution.  Other than that, we have a reasonably entertaining tale of US good guys vs. the fanatical Jihadist Yemen bad guys that illustrated a lot of research by the author about the country and its living and political conditions; that generated reasonable suspense; and that concluded with a thrilling wrap-up.  Too bad it took us 200 extra pages to get there.
157421327X|4.0|This is a great book to start your journey with Zentangle. Before long I was creating my own Zentangle designs.
B0080BFVPU|4.0|Grosse Pointe Blank is a dark comedy that explores themes such as examining one's own mortality, how far a man's morals will let him go, and the redemptive power of love. This movie manages to masterfully combine the elements of a traditional romantic comedy with enough action to satisfy those seeking the thrill of a shoot-em up buddy comedy. Gross Pointe Blank stars John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Jeremy Piven, and Dan Aykroyd.<br /><br />Grosse Pointe Blank is a movie about a hit man that feels that he is beginning to lose his touch and his passion for his work as his 10 year high school reunion approaches. Martin Blank (Cusack) returns to his hometown after 10 years for a job to eliminate someone to smooth over an earlier botched hit. Along the way he tries to reunite with his high school sweetheart, Debi (Driver). He meets up with his best friend from high school, Paul (Piven). But Martin quickly discovers that he is being tailed not only by two Federal Agents, but also a rival hitman named Grocer (Aykroyd) who wants to start a cartel for hitmen and will take out anyone that gets in his way, and another hitman hired to take him out for revenge for one of his past jobs.<br /><br />The soundtrack to Grosse Pointe Blank is filled with hit songs from the 1980s such as \\"Blister in the Sun\\" by Violent Femmes, \\"Under Pressure\\" by Queen and David Bowie, and Guns N' Roses cover of the classic \\"Live and Let Die.\\"<br /><br />Grosse Pointe Blank is rated R due to violence and strong language, so I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with young children, but it is an enjoyable date night movie.
0525953728|5.0|There's a lot of reviews with a lot of detail already. Read the book, you won't be disappointed. On a related subject, don't watch the National Geographic movie on the raid, it's horrible.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is amazing, its been in my car on repeat and I still cant get enough! This duo is genius and real.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Not a huge Tom Cruise or Jamie Foxx fan, but this was a pretty good movie. If you like other things that Michael Mann has done you should like this too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|You may think you would like to kill the person you are married to....or at the very least, just leave them.  How are bonds created?  Do you become more like the person you are married to....or are some of the characteristics you most despise in your spouse magnified in yourself?  Some readers found the ending disappointing....but if you think about it....it would be more common than you think.  It is a fast read...and very gripping and very full of suspense
B006LSZECO|5.0|Total unexpected twists and turns in the plot.  I never knew where it was going until the very exciting end.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is one of my favorite games.  Glad they finally come out for the kindle fire. Would recommend this game to play.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|When I recently read an article by the author, I sent a link to friends and family inviting them to read it.  I knew I had to have the book.  Even before he moves into the story of his heavenly experience during a coma, it's a very good read.  I've read hundreds of Near-Death Experiences stories and his well-written story is consistent with - and adds - to them.<br />My neuroscience/med school son and I have a deal that for every book I read that he wants me to read, he reads a book I want him to read.  I'd better get busy finishing the books he's given me to read so I can give him this one to read.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I'm one of the thousands of people who trusted Amazon when they said they were offering \\"unlimited\\" free music storage on Cloud Player. Given the initial bugs with their service, it took me a lot of work and time, but I eventually got my music on Cloud Player. After a few months, Amazon changes it to 5 GB. After another few months, Amazon states that there will be a 250 song limit but that limit wouldn't count previously uploaded mp3s.  Fast forward to last week: I tried playing some of the songs that I uploaded when Cloud Player was first announced, and I found that all of my uploaded songs were gone. The only songs that remained were the music that I purchased from Amazon over the past few months. Today I find out that your previously uploaded songs don't count towards the Cloud Player limit because Amazon moved all of my uploads into Cloud Drive where I can't access those songs from Cloud Player which makes it useless. Like many other people I'm not willing to pay $25.00 just because Amazon is being dishonest due to poor planning. In the future they shouldn't promise to offer services forever that are not financially sustainable, just to gain a temporary edge over competitors like Google.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I've been a loyal Amazon customer over the years. However if this is a start of a new trend with Amazon I guess I'll be shopping around for a new favorite store to patronize.<br /><br />I'm also sure of another thing: I won't be buying music from Amazon in the future. Conversely, Google treats my music files fairly. and that's where I'm moving my future media purchases.
038572179X|4.0|The first half of the book was not the best. It was slow and slightly boring for me. But the second half was good, and the ending great. I get that the beginning is needed for the ending to make sense, didn't know that till the end tho. Worth reading overall.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not one of John Grisham's best works. But still a good story. Plot seemed to ramble at points. Sometimes I think authors get such large prepayments for producing a book that quality is missing.
1423101502|5.0|This is probably the best in the first five books.  Definitely suspenseful, integrating the youth culture of today with the mythology of the ancient Grees.  Rick Riordan has a way with words.  I am enjoying young adult fiction more and more because of him.
B002PZC8BM|4.0|Smart and witty! Simon Baker is fantastic in this role. I don't know how long the show can continue to ride the wave of the serial killer Red John. The show may not have much stamina without the continuing saga of the Red John quest.
1423101499|5.0|I have loved the entire series.  Rick Riordan is an excellent writer who captures the imagination of youth with the old world culture of Greek mythology.  I read everything he writes.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once again Mr. King takes us to an alternate reality of what-ifs.  Living in Maine and having heard the &#34;shat-hoosh&#34; of the mill, seen the places and met the sort of people described only makes the fiction seem more factual.  Hang on to your seats folks because you're in for a classic Stephen King thrill of a roller coaster ride!  Another excellent page turner.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I can't not imagine why this was and still is on the best sellers list. I predicated the ending very early on the book.
1936608618|5.0|\\"Power Speed Endurance\\" is the first book to manual the concepts of CrossFit Endurance and (as far as I know of) the first book to publish strength and conditioning of the CrossFit variety in general. While the internet has made much of the information readily available there truly is no substitute for a book to lay things out in a clear to understand manner. While the book is not a tome of exercise science terminology not easily understood by the masses is IS tome of easily digestible VISUAL information. or in other words. PICTURES PICTURES PICTURES. full color and with a clear narrative. covering running, swimming, biking, strength and conditioning, mobility ****AS A SKILL****. I think that no matter where one falls on the spectrum of  volume of S+C::Sport Specific work that as the endurance community paradigm shift continues (you can see this already in the upward movement of \\"minimal\\" running shoes) it will become more and more paramount to approach these sports AS SKILLS and to have strength and conditioning as part of a properly balanced program.
B007CGLRWA|4.0|My only thought is that the threats by parents against teachers reflects the problem with education.  When you have community control of schools and emotionally disturbed students you get kids with poor educational backgrounds,
B0074VTHKM|5.0|The series was very good and different than any of John Grisham's books I have written.  They were funny and still suspenseful.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story was good but seemed to drag in a few places otherwise I would give it 5 stars rather than 4
1594135851|1.0|This book was poorly bound and the pages came out the day I got it and started reading it. Of course it's such a good read I had to finish and my kids had to read it (just like old manuscripts, page by page) now Amazon will not take it back. BOO!
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Never heard of this band.  Saw the album cover and it caught my eye.  Listened to some preview tracks and figured i would give it a shot.  I am extremely happy with this album, this band rocks and I will eventually get the rest of their discography.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Typical smartass John Corey!  Great action that we always expect from DeMille.  We can't wait for the next book to come out!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If anyone of reasonable intelligence and discernment can honestly say they are not a fan of this stunningly engrossing masterpiece, they evidently do not live on planet earth. Did I say engrossing? Captivating, riveting -- absolutely! Laurels and accolades all around, to the least of the servants of the lower hall to the indomitable Dowager Lady Grantham. This is one fascinating and compelling mini-series.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|Well-written account from a long ago time. I could not put it down. Made me want to see the movie of the same name.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another masterpiece. The plot unravels at a good pace and I enjoyed the characters. Not a complex, multiple character novel, but enough odd twists to capture and hold your attention. Thanks for another job well done.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|More than 300 hundred excellent could not be wrong I thought. It is a very good book, I learned a lot but if you want to spare your money the title resumes it all. Do not make your visitors (students) think or guess where they can find your stuff.  ThatÂ's all amigos.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|I have ordered this and as right now its 11:10 am and still haven't gotten it. From all of the reviews its an outstanding knife. Yeah some people may not like the handle but hey its a 40 dollar knife its like the difference between Lexus and Toyota you get what you pay for. I've payed upwards of 400 dollars for blades in the past and I'm happy I did in their respect but I know schrade and I also know that they really know how to make good quality products. Just think about it. They're a tool company that makes awesome blades. They know their steel. Plus they're a respected company that have been around for more than a day.<br />I gotta tell you I can't wait to check this apparent beast out for myself. As soon as it gets here.<br /><br />Check back when I get it and will update.<br /><br />OK got it in and I could not be happier with this purchase, if you are reading this and still contemplating on buying this knife, think no more just buy it.<br />You could not get a better deal for a knife this size/quality.<br />The knife is massive. The blade is 1/4\\" thick and its heavy. Granted the handle may need some personal tweaking to make it fit your hand better. Its a steal. Plain and simple this knife I would have expected to pay at least $100 for. Look no further if you want a great combat/hunting/work knife for the low price it's at.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|This the first album of hers I have purchased. I really like the \\"never ever\\" song. The rest of the album is okay. It is a more mature sounding Taylor Swift. She doesn't sound country though. Not at all really. I don't recommend it at full price. Wait till it's on sale.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The worst book he ever wrote.......I think he is running out of ideas. The most boring book i have ever read.

B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I got my Kindle Fire HD two weeks ago.  Since I wanted to view  files which I had written and stored online, I need to upgrade the basic version of this program (which is pretty useless) to the \\"pro\\" version.  It was an expensive app for what it did, but there appeared to be little choice.  Today, just 2 weeks later, I notice that the cost of this app has dropped drastically to 1/3 (one third) of what I paid for it just two weeks ago.  I feel completely ripped off since I don't understand why I had to pay three times as much for it.  The app functions but it is not worth what I paid for it.  After this experience with the amazon Kindle app store, I will be very wary about buying any future apps from amazon.  I hate being ripped off.<br /><br />PS: In addition, if you want the fonts that go with this app, you have to spend an extra five dollars.  Kind of useless to have an office suite app without the fonts it requires! Buyer beware!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|OMG BEST game EVER!!!!!!!!!! Will he playing it ALL the time!!! WOOP WOOP!!!!!! Man BEST game EVER!!!!! No matter what!!! Nobody can change my mind.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Thank You For Smoking is funny satire done with great style.  It is sophisticated - doesn't resort to slapstick.  The \\"hero,\\" a tobacco lobbyist, is a guy it's hard not to like.  He is objectively confident about being good at what he does.  The target of the film isn't tobacco lobbying.  The film is a challenge to be more aware of the spins that surround us and not be taken in by them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great for Minecrafters like me. No updates for the kindle though. I waited since I got this kindle to buy it and its worth the whole $7.00.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|V for Vendetta is based on a graphic novel set in a totalitarian England.  V, a man who was brutalized by the government, sets out to kill those in power who carried out the brutality, as well as to create a chaotic situation which might release the people from the hold of their terroristic government.  In fact, this mythic drama raises the question:  \\"What really defines terrorism?\\"  It depicts aggression in the name of freedom.  I liked this film very much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a very nicely written. I wanted to first read the books just to see what everyone was talking about, but when I started reading I was very intrigued and I wanted to keep going to find out how their lives would turn out. I really did like the books.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is a family favorite in our household.  We have watched it numerous times and continue to enjoy it.  The plot is simple enough for our three year to follow it but entertaining enough for Mom and Dad.  The characters are wonderful, with the minions being our favorites.
B008ENA74E|5.0|This book read like a novel. I could not put it down. The author definitely picked the right field to be in. It gives insight into Goldman Sachs.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book can be depressing at times, but just when you're ready to give up, the author sucks you back in. I loved learning about the different meanings of flowers.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is just one more example of the outstanding ability and vision of the Flaming Lips. Easily one of my favorite albums at this point. I look forward to getting this at some point on vinyl in addition to the CD I have.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|This, combined with I-Syncr (both from the same company) combine perfectly to pull Itunes into my Droid GS2 and maintain my library exactly as it is in my I pod Touch. I could not be happier, and they do a great job in simplifying what is not always the best process of getting music into the droid.
B002NYC4VY|5.0|ABBA's Voulez-Vous is a great example of disco that has character and joy, and is not faceless and spiritless like most of disco albums of those days. I bet I would have loved the record. Trouble is that I bought it but it got lost in the mail. I am enjoying mine on CD.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is addicting and fun. i would definitely recomend this game to everyone. i'm at lvl 192 and still cant stop playing.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|If I'd known this would be on sale I would gave waited but I didn't. Trust me, thus game is amazing and great fun for a tablet game. I was reminded of the old spiderman the movie 2 game for ps2.  it takes a lot of memory but for a dollar, it is WORTH it!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Not as good as the first book in this series. Alittle predictiable but still a good read.  Just does not beat the first in this series.
B007SGM084|5.0|As usual, the first book is the best one, and is the reason for the 5 stars.  Book 2 is also a good read, but book 3 went a bit too fairy tale.  But even so, don't stop without reading all of them!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Really beautiful story, well written and heartfelt. Loved it. Seeing life through the eyes of this noble dog was a treat and done so well, I wanted to go find me a new best friend!

So I was pretty shocked to see them being sold here for as high as $80.00. The product is good, but lets face it, we are talking about paying $40-$80 dollars for very simple and pretty small cutting boards. Its not the boards you are paying the price for, its the asthetics. They are cute and unique. But, because the boards actually make contact with each other in the holder, that kind of defeats the purpose of having multiple boards for various food types. If you are responsible enough to clean each board after each use to the point of sanitizing them, then you probably don't need multiple boards in the first place. If you are not, then you are simply cross contaminating the boards in the holder.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I just finished reading this book. I couldn't put it down and found Mitch Rapp to be again on top of his game. It's well worth the read but a warning.  You won't be able to put it down. It grabs your attention form the first page to the last. So be prepared for long hours of reading. I finished it in three days. It's one of the best Mitch Rapp books.
B008458O3S|5.0|very fun. plenty of tutorials so you don't have to guess what you're doing, yet very challenging at times as well.  trainyard, quell, and ichi are the three best puzzle games out there (imho).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was not sure I liked the lead character (deputy) in the first episode of season three, but have changed my mind with subsequent episodes.  I like all the characters and enjoy watching new additions to the cast.  The writing,so far, has been fair to good.  I will continue to watch the rest of the season to see what develops.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Probably the best book of the three.  It's and easy read and I cannot put the book down.  I want more from the author.
B0000027D5|5.0|Two hours of nearly all instrumental music, beautifully recorded at Santana's peak as a band.  Tom Coster is great on this recording, as is Carlos.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|About the only book I can read more than once.  Great ending to a beautiful love story, albiet totally unrealistic.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|I found this book to be completely mesmerising.  I could not put it down, it is well written, fast paced and unbelievably realistic. Having been to India a number of times, I felt as though I could smell and touch the places described in the book. It is hard to believe that one individual can suffer so much in one life time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's very addicting and both my husband and I enjoy watching together (very few shows like that).  Keep em coming.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This is the best Google Reader app around for iphone or Kindle. I've tried others (like GReader) but this is hands-down my favorite.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|this game should have a timeless demo, becouse I got really exited.(I was building a castle.) then suddenly it said that my demo time is over or something like that anyways, fun game. :)
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I first read Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" many years ago. This depiction of Batman's universe took my senses back to the grit of the 1980's: a time when street punks still lurked, the best video games cost a quarter to play, and most cities had yet to receive the cleansing effect of modern urban renewal efforts.<br /><br />The Batman we are presented with here is a veteran from a lifetime of war, struggling to decide whether or not to don the cape for one more battle. Whether or not this story is still relevant after more than 25 years is up to the viewer. From my perspective, its themes are as powerful today as they were in 1986.<br /><br />This film succeeds in delivering the essence of the original graphic novel in striking detail. The adaption of the story from pane to frame is seamless.  However, viewers may be disappointed that they will have to wait for the release of the conclusion.
1936608618|5.0|I have been waiting quite some times to get my hands on this book...and it was well worth the wait. Brian, awesome work on your first forray into the world of book writing. This book is so full of information it's hard to believe they crammed it all into 320 pages. PSE dives in much deeper than just laying out programming templates for endurance training, which, unfortunately is what a lot of books on endurance training do. Two big things set PSE apart from all other books on this topic. 1) teaching endurance sports as skill based activities, especially running. 2) Emphasizing the importance of a quality strength & conditioning program that provides the fitness base that endurance is built from. Layer on top of that all the additional mobility work with Kelly Starrett and you have yourself one of the most impactful books written about endurance training in decades.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Unfortunately, all of the interesting moments in the movie are in the trailer.  Johnny Depp is perfect for the role, but the script didn't have enough of the dry wit displayed in the trailer.  It's not the best movie I've ever seen and it not the worst.  It's just OK.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Not sure why she gets all the hate. I can listen to this album over and over. I wish I had more music like this.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Season 4 is another amazing season! I love the new dynamic this season that is permitting viewers to see some aspects of Sam's personal life and how it is intertwined with his professional life. I can't wait to see how all of this plays out.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Pointless, boring, unbelievable. Probably churns out money, but this book neither amuses nor instructs. Save your money - read something else.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I started watching Revenge and I couldn't stop. It seems the villains get worse and worse. But who is the worst of all, really?
1475143389|5.0|A great book that cuts through all of the fitness jargon to provide you with the necessary framework to reach your fitness goals. In addition to the book, Mike makes himself available to answer any questions you might still have after reading his book.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|EDIT: I WAS WRONG. PLEASE REVIEW UPDATE BELOW! Even though this is a kindle fire edition it places graphics in the app partition.  This means over half of your app partition is taken up by this ONE game. Not smart!  Other games like Asphalt 6 offload the graphics to the content partition.<br /><br />UPDATE: The app complained about space many times then abruptly said there was a problem with the download and re-downloaded and installed correctly. Weird and frustrating but not as broken as it appeared to be.
B000F8O35U|2.0|I purchased this under the impression that it was new. The dvd was shrink wrapped....poorly I might add...with air bubbles, and burnt edges....( I used to shrink wrap things at an office supply chain, so I know what it looks like)...the inserts looked like they were obviously printed. The movie works/plays, but I dont think I got a genuine Disney movie.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is my favorite app, I use it every night. It has many choices for sounds and I change my sounds to suit my moods. Thank you so much for this helpful app.
0525953728|1.0|\\"Mark Owen\\" knows everything.  He knows more than any four star general; he knows more than the President. These couch-sitters, along with their toadying lawyers, find excuse after excuse to do nothing. Owen knows better.  He knows, for example, that there's no point in taking anyone prisoner.  They will just be back on the street in a few days where he will have to fight them again. \\"Owen\\" knows who the right targets are better than any bureaucrat, who only try to tie his hands: e.g., all Taliban fighters wear black Cheetah sneakers.  Why not get it over with already and kill them up front?<br /><br />Women play no part here; they almost don't exist.  The only reference to hair color is to a woman \\"blond\\"; women are just those annoying spouses at home who force you to hold babies and mow the lawn when all you justifiably want to do is veg out on the sofa with a beer.  These real men can't wait to leave home again, where they can go after more \\"squirters\\" in high tops using their neat-o keen-o video game gear.  The one women in the book with an ounce of brains, the CIA analyst who found Bin Laden, does nothing other than cry after he is captured.<br /><br />Among the many oaths that \\"Mark Owen\\" took when he entered the service was not to publish a book like this without having it vetted for classified information.  But \\"Owen\\" knows so much more than anyone who would vet it that he can decide for himself, unilaterally, what should be withheld and what shouldn't be. Of course since he's left the service, it matters not one whit to him that any idiot can see that our adversaries now know the bases, the gear, the weapons, the tactics.  They can now more easily frustrate the goals of the United States and target more of \\"Owen's\\" colleagues.  By rushing to cash in on this story, \\"Owen\\" has made the world less safe.  No wonder all of the charities that he claims to be donating \\"most\\" of the profits from this book to are refusing to get anywhere near him.
0345803485|3.0|I am shocked by all the vitriol and hostility leveled at this book. In this day and age, you certainly aren't the best and brightest if you delve into this book expecting anything more from it than exactly what it is - a poorly written fantasy romance. I read the Twilight trilogy, and found it to be equally as poorly written and definitely more offensive because it involved a teenage girl versus a grown woman. This book is entertaining in the same way trashy reality television is entertaining, and perhaps even more so because it is so detached from reality. I read a review that said Christian Grey (minus his kinky sexual predilections perhaps) is basically every teenage girl's fantasy - an incredibly good looking billionaire who sweeps the protagonist off her feet. That essentially sums it up for me and explains why it is such a fun read - it bears no semblance to reality! It is escapism with steamy (although eventually somewhat repetitive) sex scenes. It is such a fast read, and after reading some pretty heavy books, it was exactly what I needed. If you go into this with high expectations, you will be disappointed. If, however, you accept it for the trashy Twilight fan fiction it is, you will get a fun read out of it. I will definitely read the next two books, likely interspersed between actual literature, but I'll read them nonetheless.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Where to start...?  There is nothing ORIGINAL left.  Lucas has done unspeakable things to this trilogy and franchise. Not even mentioning the prequels, don't even get me started on those effects-substituted-for-story movies.  Jar jar...must ..contain ..nerd ..rage!  How many more times will he re-release the real Star Wars with more trash added?  Maybe Disney will have the intestinal fortitude a set to release the remastered ORIGINAL theatrical release, but I doubt it.<br /><br />Time for me to dig out my original VHS copies and back them up on my computer, it sure doesn't look like I'm ever going to be able to replace them.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!  NOT ORIGINAL!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i played it on facebook before my kindle. it plays the same on computer and the kindle. i was surprised.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I'm usually a big John Grisham fan, but I thought this book was far below his usual standard.  I found the characters unlikeable and the story boring.  I lost interest about halfway through and had to force myself to finish. I expect so much more from this author.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I like this show. It's on my must watch list. I watch it every week and look forward to the next.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|they did it again. this is listed among the top free. it is not. clearly the process by which they list apps needs to be reviewed. that is why I am giving a single star. pull your heads out guys.
B006WJ0332|5.0|Great ending to a great series! Fresh plotline, but I would have loved to see Payton and Lucas in the final episode
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is one of those books you can't put down. It follows a young man's journey; not just a physical journey but a mental and an emotional journey as well. How he handles joy, despair, adventure and strife with a positive attitude, always keeping in mind that his situation could change in a heartbeat creates an uplifting tale. Life of Pi was a joy to experience through written word.
B009B0L324|5.0|It is amazing that 20 years ago, when AC/DC released their last live record, they were considered pretty much a spent force when it came to studio albums. I remember reading a review of \\"live\\" in Kerrang or Metal Hammer, in which the reviewer who gave \\"Live\\" 5 out of 5, stated that this was the only time now in AC/DC's career, that he could for see giving the band top marks.<br />How times have changed, with \\"Ball Breaker\\", \\"Stiff upper lip\\" & \\"Black Ice\\" (admittedly this album is a little hit & miss, but it will do), AC/DC's credibility has gone through the roof, being named checked by everybody as a major influence.<br />Which is why \\"River Plate\\" is much more than just a nostalgia concert, which is what you would get if it was The Stones or The Who releasing a new live record.<br />The new songs slot in well with the classic tracks(although no songs from \\"Ball Breaker\\", or \\"Stiff upper..\\", which is a shame) & the crowd are on fire, even doing harmonics, which I've never heard before at an AC/DC gig. The band still gives an energetic performance considering their ripe old age.<br />Live albums always work better, when there recorded from one venue, instead of a whole tour, constantly fading in & out after each song, losing momentum.  But \\"River Plate\\" feels like a one off special event, which always makes a live more appearing to listen to.It is interesting that back in the 70's & 80's, rock bands would regularly release a live album every 3-4-studio albums, but \\"AC/DC Live\\" was one of the last big selling live albums (Thanks Kirk Cobain).<br />Nowadays it only really Iron Maiden that do live albums, so it a little difficult to judge \\"River Plate\\" by contemporary standards, but then again AC/DC have never concerned themselves with shifting musical fashions.<br />The only nit-pick I have, is that it's a shame AC/DC didn't record the gig in a small club, like The Stones have been doing in 2012, perhaps that could be the band  next live venture.
B007SGM084|4.0|I liked the story line but I think it would have been just as good without all the explicit sex. It certainly enlightened me to a whole different world.
1936608618|4.0|So happy I've been able to take my learnings from this book and add them into my CrossFit Endurance classes. It's been extremely helpful in developing my Endurance athletes.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I had no idea what this book was about just that everyone at work was reading it. I really enjoyed it but was a bit disappointed in the ending.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|i really love this game. when i happen to get some down time i like to play it.easy to get started and can stop anytime.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Not the best Reacher but another good read.  As always Reacher is in trouble and as always he bust a few heads and then rides into the sunset.  Lee Child has the formula down pat and all the Reacher books are fun to read.  Just don't expect any new twist to a familiar script.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I haven't yet completed this book however I really like it. I recommend it to anyone who saw the motion picture in the movie theater.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I just added this review because of all the idiots that gave it 1 star because they can't read and didn't know what they were really looking for.  The Christian Bale/Christopher Nolan films are titled like so: \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"The Dark Knight\\", and \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\".  It amazes me that people would a) buy this thinking it was one of those films, and b) blame THE MOVIE for THEIR mistakes.  Makes me want to take a look at the reviews on Beethoven: Greatest Hits and see how many people are upset that the cd doesn't feature a st. bernard.<br /><br />I haven't seen this movie, but if ANY of the other animated Batman movies/shows are any indication, it will be great.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It's an amazing author who writes a predictable ending that is so &#34;omg did that just happen&#34; that it still shocks you when it happens.<br /><br />My money is practically already spent on the next book in the series.
B001EKP5FK|5.0|Great combo of movies. I am a huge fan of all the stars and The Way We Were is one of my all time favorites, as is The Prince of Tides. I would highly recommend this combo to anyone!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Love the movies!  Was very glad to get all four movies in one set.  Dvd's were in good condition and so was the box.  Received it promptly.  Would recommend this service again.
0425263916|5.0|After reading &#34;Bared to You&#34; I anxiously awaited &#34;Reflected to You&#34; and it did not disappoint! I can't wait until the third book! Gideon -- ****Swoon****
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I am not a movie critic just another mom watching movies with her children and I rather liked the movie because it was exciting and had a lot of graphics. My kids loved it but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00A665XFU|2.0|I real clunker in an otherwise excellent show. The comedienne is poorly scripted in a dramatically unrealistic story, a plot line that, it's quite obvious, has the stars of the show gasping for breath. With the exception of something you learn about Cary, this is the one to skip.<br /><br />May as well mention here that this season has made useless Kalinda's presence on the show. The writers took an excellent, interesting character, and for reasons unknown, made her a lonesome ex-wife of a completely uninteresting thug. She now goes from scene to scene answering the question \\"where have you been\\" with \\"dealing with personal stuff.\\" Not exactly interesting stuff.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|After being prompted to watch the original Silent Hill prior to seeing the new Release, I'm glad I purchased original Silent Hill movie.  I thought this was a pretty good horror/sci-fi movie.  It had a good twisted plot.  The whole holier-than-thou town aspect with the witch philosophy going on....  I thought it had a lot of good memorable scenes... the school bathroom scene, the whole edge of town thing, where if you leave, you fall in into this deep trench, the decent down into the hell, where the beast lives and getting by all of the no faced nurses was really good.  I was not as impressed with the ending as I was anticipating.  I thought it could have been a little more creative.  But, all-in-all, pretty good movie... will watch again several times.  Waiting for the new 3d Silent Hill to come out on blu-ray.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|got thru the training... but like other aps this one does not recognize the direction the pad is.  its hard to fly upside down.  turn the kindle so it correct and it flips the video upside down again.<br /><br />i like the game overall.  but cant play with my kindle hd

0425263916|5.0|It was a really good book. I read it so fast and was done in like 1 day. The story of Eva and Gideon really has you on the edge of your seat. I love it and cant wait for the next one to come out!!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|If you are a fan of Michael Jackson this is a must, excellent performance put on by the king, have watched it at least 20 times
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Love this movie to death. Gets better every time I watch it. I take it to work to watch when I time. The 3D disc is out of this world.
B00006FDCD|5.0|good product, good price. ultimate stephen king. one of his very best. was delivered as advertised and when advertized. thanks.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|As a very young child, I learned to read using comic books: Superman, Batman, the Flash and Green Lantern.  Green Arrow, unlike Batman, although technically not a SUPER hero, has not (to the best of my knowledge) been portrayed  on the big and only once on the small screen.  Can't really say about this newest incarnation, yet, although Smallville's Oliver Queen left a little something to be desired.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I loved this book so much that I was compelled to write a good review.  Well written, sweet and fun.  Different and I loved it!  Good read!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My kids and I have to fight to see who gets to play first. It is repeative but the kids love it.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|Every time I click to get this, it takes me to the page charging me instead of just downloading. Guess why I'd rather shop Google Play?
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love this book now I am on mark of Athena. I highly recommend this book...no, I recommend the series! Rick riordan does great books, I also recommend the Percy Jackson series,which I am still reading, and the kane chronicles!!!!!! Read this stuff, it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B008AX1HD8|5.0|What a great read. Only discovered this book thru Amazon, thought i had read all of Jo Nesbo's books starting with Redbreast.<br />Great story telling, hard to put down. Can't wait for latest book. First book read on a kindle, have to say i like it.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|They don't make a high enough number. Either for the movie or for the HD delivery to the Kindle HD. It's like a big juicy wet one right on the kisser from your heart's truest love.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It took a while to get into it. Maybe not understanding English ways. Once I got the people straight I did like the book. It took a while.  I would read it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heaven, by neurosurgeon Eben Alexander, details his NDE (near-death experience) while in a coma from a prolonged case of a rare bacterial meningitis. But I cannot entirely recommend it because it is repetitive and poorly structured, occasionally rambling, and only occasionally knits together the various details of his life introduced through the story. The most convincing part of the book has to do with the surface-level detailing of why Alexander's experience could not have been a simple matter of brain chemistry. I truly would have liked to hear more about Alexander's concept of consciousness, from a brain science perspective as well as from a spiritual one. The author miraculously recovered from his illness, and I found myself wondering if he would have been better served waiting a few more years, and allowing his brain to heal further, before recounting his NDE, with more perspective and detail. (Or perhaps he needed a much more meticulous book editor.) In spite of this rather critical review, I would probably read more from this author, if he publishes another book, because he does have a compelling story to tell.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This is a review of the Amazon ecosystem, not the game. The game is fine and well made. The problem is that Amazon will not let you play it on devices that are capable of playing it, like my Asus Transformer. I had to buy this game twice, once here, only to find out that it would not even show up on my Amazon Appstore, and finally on Google Play Store. I guess Amazon want to force consumers to buy their Kindle Fire HD in order to play this game, but all that they are doing is alienate consumers, and drive them to buy the game somewhere else. Google Play store gives you the option to get a refund for this game, Amazon does not. I will be buying my games and apps from the Google Play store from now on since this experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth regarding the Amazon Appstore.
B009DJB9HC|3.0|I love these guys, but something seems out-of-balance on this CD.  There seems to be too much Glenn Hughes and not enough Joe Bonamassa - vocally, compositionally, and lyrically.  Something doesn't seem right with the production either.  I normally like Kevin Shirley's production, but this CD doesn't sound quite right.  I'm not sure if was something in the recording, the mixing, or the mastering.  Bob Ludwig did the mastering and he's a legend.  Not sure what else to say except that is feels kind of like a Glenn Hughes solo album, not a BCC album.  Maybe the CD will grow on me as I listen to it more.  Bottom Line - I still love these guys!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|No doubt he can write but the plots, style and ending are becomng all too familiar.<br />I will be less inclined to read the next one.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|The first half of the book did not do well.  Wordy, Scarpetta as &#34;cougar&#34; and In less than her usual confident self.  I almost gave up but at $12.99 for an ebook I persevered. All of a sudden it changed. the writing got crisper, the whine decreased some and the boy toy was never heard of again. I might almost suspect someone else wrote the first half.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it really is a great game.. if you want something to do with your time while you are waiting.. this helps with that problem!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love all her videos - she puts the great in monder violin playing.  Her CD is very good and easy listening.  Can't wait for her next one.
B008VBYN80|5.0|it is a really good game doesn't have any glitches so far. I reccomend this for people who like to build towns
B003TSEEDY|5.0|READ THIS BOOK! It's the best book I've ever read. It has saved my life and I plan on having at least one of it's quotes tattooed onto me. I've read it countless times and it never fails to make me cry, smile, and just feel renewed. Absolutely perfect. I recommend it to all of my friends. You won't regret reading this book.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Grade: C-<br /><br />L/C Ratio: 40/60<br />(This means I estimate the author devoted 40% of his effort to creating a literary work of art and 60% of his effort to creating a commercial bestseller.)<br /><br />Thematic Breakdown:<br />30% - Mystery<br />25% - Adventure<br />20% - Technology<br />20% - Books<br />  5% - Romance<br /><br />If Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore was intended to be Dan Brown satire, then it is a work of genius. But I highly doubt that was Robin Sloan's intention for his debut novel.<br /><br />Despite its fun title and intriguing setup, the book fails to become anything truly engrossing, and at times it morphs into little more than a full-fledged advertisement for Google. The conspiracy that drives most of the action is both convoluted and underwhelming, and every plot twist involves a far too convenient epiphany that the main characters should have thought of many pages earlier.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, the first-person narrator in Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is quite a mixed bag. He's a young, unemployed geek who gets thrust into an adventure involving a secret society and a strange library. His humorous attitude works well in a few spots, but for the most part, he comes off as downright obnoxious.<br /><br />Noteworthy Quote:<br /><br />\\"Every day you learn something amazing,\\" Kat says, \\"like, there's a secret underground library in New York City\\"--she pauses and gapes for effect, and it makes me laugh--\\"and you realize there's so much more that's waiting. Eighty years isn't enough. Or a hundred. Whatever. It's just not.\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It was easy to give this App 5 stars. It is so easy to use and has wonderful additional resources.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A great fun game, plus its free. It is rather disappointing to have to pay cash money for access to some stuff, but thankfully its completely optionally. I highly recommend it to any briny or fan of the show.
8866130915|4.0|This product is of high quality and well designed for the best organization tool to keep a busy person on time and at the right place. I am very pleased with this product and the usefulness of it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|As a follower of some nice sagas, I bought this set expecting some nice things. But... being just 5 discs it lacks some nice extras I'd love to see in HD. Trsut your previous DVD collection for behind the scenes and that sort of things. Don't misinterpret my words. The movies and extras are fine, but I consider it could be a great chance for the producers to give fans all of the stuff Indy has for us.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Basic Idea, Sherlock Holmes redone for our times.<br /><br />Watson has a sex change<br /><br />Holmes is just getting out of rehab.<br /><br />And they all moved to New York, where Aiden Quinn serves as some high placed police detective or what not.<br /><br />Gone is Mycroft, instead there's Sherlock's father who is never seen, nor heard from, only emails to Watson that we never get to see.  (Plot mistake in my mind)<br /><br />To give it credit it gives a nod to the Sherlock of old, but the plots aren't the same derivative mutations of classic plots that I've seen in the past (granted it's been a good 40 years since I read the original stories, many of my little gray cells have died since then (apologies to Agatha Christie).)<br /><br />Still plots are intelligent, the puzzle of the murders are decent and they don't cheat overly.  If you pay attention you have a good chance of following along.<br /><br />Character interaction, which is something that I really prize in a series gets off to a shaky start, but has progressed and gotten considerably more solid as episodes have progressed.<br /><br />It's taking it awhile to evolve, but I think there's a lot of potential if they keep taking it in the same direction and as of right now, episodes are quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Not as good as Sherlock (BBC Series) yet, but there's a lot more of it to enjoy.<br /><br />And from what I'm reading, there may only be a third season with 2-3 episodes if you're lucky and an end to that whole thing.<br /><br />Bottom line, up and coming, recommended
B006H5120E|5.0|I loved the theatrical version... Have the VHS, couldn't have the DVD's but... as soon as BD were available, I bought it and watched it immediatly. Full extras... Cameron's divings, intewrviews, comentaries,... And the special made for the centenary (I saw it at History)... Unbelievable and satisfying. I'd like all of the movies could have such great backup stories and include them in their products. Way to go!
B009IF8CH6|4.0|On this series, I think I'm getting my money's worth.<br /><br />Episodes for the most part are entertaining.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of &#34;humiliating the character&#34; type humor, so knocking a star off for some of that.<br /><br />And it seems like the female cast continue to get more and more snarky ( *itchy) as time progresses.<br /><br />But overall a good comedic experience.
1419703692|5.0|I bought this book after reading other people's comments. And they were true! Fans shall be excited by knowing some things sometimes elusive if you're not stuck to tv specials or web featurettes. Nice way to appreciate the hard work behind a fantasy that possibly could be true.
B009GX7IRA|3.0|Originally I loved this series, started going sideways last season;  Stories more than a little bit over the top.  Directions that they took the story just didn't catch my imagination.<br /><br />Not to fault the actors, I think they're doing well with what they've been given.<br /><br />This season, even more of the same, a lot of stories just seem to be there marking time.<br /><br />Still fairly enjoyable, but I'm personally close to cancelling my subscription as at this time, I'm not driven to see the episodes as soon as they come out.<br /><br />I wish them well, and hope they manage to pull out of what I personally perceive as a slump.
1608871045|4.0|Nice book. Narrated in first person by Bruce Wayne, is a must for gadget fans and curious people on subjects like arquitecture and mechanics. It get us close to the reality behind the fantasy.
B002PZC8BM|4.0|I'll admit it, TV commercials are over the top, I'm trying an experiment where I basically chuck cable in favor of netflix and amazon.  Came across this, during a TBS marathon (I think that was the station), and so bought a couple of episodes in season 4, and am currently subscribed to season 5.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar, Patrick Jane, was a mentalist, talked to the dead for people (was running a scam as there is no thing as a psychic - Jane repeated ad nausem).<br /><br />Red John kills his family, for no other reason apparently than he didn't care for Jane acting like he knew him on a TV show.<br /><br />Year in loony bin, then off to work for the cops as a consultant.<br /><br />Again, if you go through the episodes, there's some serious logic gaps;<br /><br />Red John's cohorts kill off an office of police officers and yet they pretty much drop it in 5 minutes.  No massive police effort, no ongoing interest by anyone really than Jane.<br /><br />and Red John.... doesn't appear to be ANY logic behind the man, although he is connected to everyone and his mother.<br /><br />Still all in all the cast is a good ensemble cast, the murder per episodes are at least marginally entertaining.<br /><br />And I have to say the first episode of this last season had me laughing out loud at the antics.<br /><br />There's some silliness with &#34;Lorelei&#34; who is supposed to be a known conspirator with Red John.<br /><br />Leave your logic at the door, kick it into neutral and let it pull you along for a fairly decent ride.<br /><br />Likely the best I've seen that is still generating new episodes this season.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I dont know if I disliked this book because its a young adult book. I don't think so though, because I like many young adult books. The characters were boring, one dimensional and cliche. And there wasn't enough of a plot to make up for the poor character development. Most of the book was about the progression of their boring and juvenile relationship.  Abby was a raging bore. Travis was the sensitive tortured bad boy, who liked to beat people up needlessly and mercilessly. I guess it was supposed to be sexy or cute or romantic that Travis was putting people in the hospital for saying words he didn't like. I think it was gross and immature. Also the writing was boring.

0803738412|5.0|Great book!  Both my 2 year old and 4.5 year old loved this book and I look forward to bringing it out each October.  This book does a great job of reminding our little ones to use manners in a very subtle way.  We work hard to remind our kids of their 'please' and 'thank yous' and this book was wonderful for that and had a cute story too.

B0086700CM|5.0|so addictive. I have unlocked every person. plus my little bro plays it and loves it. sometimes slow though. awesome.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I love this album, it makes me reminisce on my own childhood. His flow is very fluid and advanced. There's some songs that grew on me, some that I find a different thing to enjoy the next listen. His stories are vivid, and I feel relate-able on some level for most. The aggressive roles are understood because he or his character is so mild mannered and sensible. If you love lyricism this is a must-have.<br /><br />First gravitated to: Real, Money Trees, Sing About Me.., Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe, Poetic Justice
B005FPT51K|1.0|First, let me start by saying that i have never left feedback for anything before (and i buy a lot of products on Amazon....several a week for several years).  This product, however, has earned my first review....and it is a terrible one.  I have never before been so frustrated with a customer service experience and product expereince as this one. Perhaps it is my fault for thinking that a \\"mom and pop\\" company could produce a product that every parent wants and no other company offers.  Apparently the reason that no other company offers this (as of yet) is because it is terribly difficult to do so with any consistency of success).  Let me admit, that there is some success but for many it simply wont work, or wont work very long.  My brother in law bought one of these first and had so much difficulty in setting it up (he is not a technical idiot either) that he had to call in his friend who is works for an internet servce provider as a Technical Support Manager to eventually get it set up.  It took this guy 5 HOURS to set it up and he is an expert...he told my brother in law that he cant believe they actually sell this product to the general public!  IN SPITE OF THIS....i bought one (stupid, i know), hoping that i would be one of the lucky ones.  Here is my story:<br />FIRST one i bought was delivered as new, but was actually used (this is not necessarily iBaby's fault, but the sellers).  It had some sort of strawberry jelly on it and was missing the installations CD).  I never even tried it and returned it.<br />SECOND one i got arrived new as advertised....unfortunately even new it didnt work.  After calling their \\"customer service\\" number (WHICH is really just an answering machine that you have to wait days to hear back from) and troubleshooting for 2 sessions over 4 days, they advised that i had received a \\"lemon\\" and that i should return it.<br />THIRD one i received, started off better then either of the first 2.  It actually worked, BUT ONLY OVER MY LOCAL WIFI NETWORK...not remotely (which is why i bought this).  At first, i figured it was just my settings and that i could fix it later.  I called \\"customer service answering machine\\" again (twice) and finally got a call back where i was told i would have to email customer service the info (dont know why i couldnt explain it over the phone?)  I did email and heard back pretty quickly...ahh relief. That relief was short lived, when i followed their intstrustions to only discover that it still didnt work.  emailed again, got more instructions...still didnt work.  emailed again and was asked to send screenshot photos of my router settings.  they then told me that (and i am QUOTING THEM), \\"you have everything set up correctly and i dont know why it would work?\\"  THis entire process has taken almost an entire month and probably more then 20 hours of work and i still dont have a working ibaby camera and have no direction from their customer service to solve this.  PARENTS, please do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  it is terrible.  my suggestion is to wait until a larger company tackles this product idea and buy theirs.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|But some parts were too detailed and scientific (ie boring) but the actual story was entertaining if you skip all the math problems.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Magic Mike - I expected more.  I was thrilled with Channing Tatum however his acting is better than this movie portrayed.  And I have to say I was very disappointed with Matt McConahay (sp?) who is my all time FAVORITE actor!
B008NABUU8|3.0|If you are looking for an entertaining way to kill a little time (and isn't that why we play these things) then this construction game will do that.

B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game.  It allows for timed solutions and many different arrangements.  I play it almost as much as I play Scrabble!
B006UW9M4C|5.0|If you like Riot then you most likely love Thundersteel, Rock City and Fire Down Under. Immortal Soul is literally Thundersteel Pt2. made a few decades later. So ya, you will love this CD. the first song on the CD will show you exactly what I mean by \\"Thundersteel Pt2\\". Enjoy, and \\"Please call me Whiskey Man!\\".
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed this book, though Katness seemed in a state of dispair trough pretty much the entire book. Almost a downer compared to the first two. Worth reading though.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|People couldn't hear anything I was saying total waste of $30. I hate that there was no way to return it to get my money back.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Great gameplay. Amazing Spiderman=Amazing Graphics. I got this app with my kf and it works like a charm. If you play the side missions often, as opposed to sticking to the story missions, you can milk hours, days and maybe even weeks out of this one app. The only downside to this app is the amount of space it requires. Over 1000 MB. Even with this disadvantage, I think that this game stool deserves a five star rating from anyone who plays it.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|This is the littlest micro SDHC card reader I've come across. It's very well made. It reads & writes extremely fast. The casing is metal, NOT PLASTIC! Way to go Kingston on a very amazing product.
0316228532|1.0|Like others I wanted to read this book by this author.  What I got was disappointment. I would not recommend anyone spending their money nor their time on this one.  It took me almost the whole book before I thought it was getting interesting, but it let me down.  I finished it only because I had invested my time and wanted to see how it ended....well that was a disappointment too. Ms Rowling can do better....we know this....but her venture outside of Harry Potter was a let down.  I wanted this to be good, but it just wasn't.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not gonna write a summary, there are already well over 1,000 reviews so I'll just keep it simple. This book did things to me I never imagined a book could do.  I felt everything.  Every emotion.  Every pain.  Everything.  I loved this book.  Don't bother with tissues.  Just go straight for the paper towel.  The whole roll.  You will laugh, and you will cry...hard.  Do not pass this book up.  It will stay with you long after you read it.  Just make sure you have a \\"chaser book\\" to follow it with, something funny.  It will be the only way to salavage whatever is left of your heart.  John Green, you are AMAZING!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterst is an amazing web site; great pictures; good info and nice variety on many<br /> Different subjects. I love it!
0316212377|2.0|I have long been a fan of Mr Banks. His authoring a NEW future of open endedness was a refreshing retreat from the dystopias that fill the sci-fi sphere.<br />This book is written fabulously with the exception that it goes nowhere. It starts with the possibility that maybe something historically important happened and ends with non-disclosure and business as usual.<br />Murder goes unpunished though recognized. Falsehoods are allowed to ascend to permanence. WTF?<br />I do not read novels 517 pages long to not arrive to a JUST conclusion. I live in the never ending morass of lies perpetuated by the elite. If I am going to read escapism literature, I want to escape.<br />Five star writing with a no-star(t) plot.

1741798981|5.0|We recently did a 7-day family trip to London (2 adults, and a 11 & 10 year olds).  This book was a very useful tool for planning our trip.  The size is handy - fitting easily into a day bag, or even into a coat pocket.  It is chocked full of useful maps and information.  Lonely Planet guides are targeted more to the budget minded independent traveler - which defines us.  Useful walking tours are outlined - defined by the amount of time you have in London.  The guide for eateries was quite reliable.<br />This book will be an indispensable tool for your next trip.
B008XM3NZQ|5.0|My favorite movie of all time! Celebrating almost 40 years and still is one of the greats. One great story, combine with great acting, great sound, and directing, and you got a masterpiece. Highest possible recommendation, for those who saw it back then, enjoy it now on Blue- Ray, it's amazing.
B008O5POWC|5.0|Tusk is probably the most listened-to album I've ever had the pleasure of picking up.  The Mac did two desert island disks for me, the other being Bare Trees.  Both albums have a stunning variety of music and illustrate the wisdom of a pop band having multiple songwriters & voices.  These 2 albums are the height of Mac for me.  Danny Kirwan on Bare Trees is as distinctive and up front as Lindsay Buckingham is on Tusk. Danny shared vocals and songwriting with Christine McVie and Bob Welch.  Christine McVie then shared with Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.  All of these bands were backed by the consistently finest rhythm section and band namesakes Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.  The Mac pretty much shared the writing chores equally through their history as a band which enabled them to continue through gradually changing lineups and from blues to pop.  Danny Kirwan brought pop out front in the Mac, Christine having already planted the seeds.  It was Kirwan's sense of melody that established the Mac sound as we know it today and Bare Trees is his masterpiece.  The song \\"Dust\\" on Bare Trees is as powerful to me as \\"That's All for Everyone\\" on Tusk.  As stated at the beginning, I listen to Tusk more frequently than any other album even though I think Bare Trees is overall best Mac effort.  But Tusk never gets old.  Each song has a freshness to it and that's a milestone for any album.  Since it was released I've owned every format from vinyl to cd to mp3 and recently, back to vinyl.  A couple months ago I ordered an original mint vinyl for a good price (less than $25)not aware that this 180lb was coming out which I will likely pick up too.  Now, can we get a remastered 180lb Bare Trees next year? And Future Games the next?
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|We used this on our macAir and video synch'd up fine to the LG LCD TV.  No audio would go through though.  It does work on a newer model 24&#34; TV very well, audio and video.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|You have to have been there to know how truly accurate and touching this film is. It is a moving depiction of varieties of aging.
B009AMANH4|5.0|When I first heard several years ago that Steven Spielberg planned to do a movie about Abraham Lincoln, I got very excited. One of the greatest film directors of our time tackling a story of one of the greatest Presidents in American history is just exciting to think about. Say what you will about Spielberg's political beliefs, but his historical films, from Shindler's List to Saving Private Ryan, are some of the best in the genre. Now, over a decade after his decision to do a film about the Great Emancipator, Spielberg's Lincoln finally hit the cinemas nationwide this past Friday. This has certainly become one of the more scrutinized films by historians and modern filmmakers. So, here I am to give my thoughts on this remarkable film.<br /><br />For this film, Spielberg has assembled one of the greatest all-star casts ever assembled. But this movie truly belongs to it's leading man: Daniel Day-Lewis. As I expected before seeing the film, Mr. Day-Lewis gives us what will surely be the definitive screen depiction of our 16th President. As the man has a penchant for doing, he delves into the role with a passion never seen by any actor who has donned the top hat. He truly shows the torment of the man who was overseeing the bloodiest war in American history, while also dealing with a wife whom he loves, though she does drive him angry at times, and the loss of his son Willie years ago. But he also shows Lincoln was a fiercely political animal, as he works to get the necessary votes needed to pass the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery, and with bringing an end to the war. But most of all, Lincoln shows the humorous nature of the man, telling yarns and jokes to help get his points across. In all three areas, Day-Lewis excels. If he doesn't at least get a nomination come Oscar time, then something is definitely wrong with affairs in Hollywood.<br /><br />Another actor who should be considered for an Oscar is Tommy Lee Jones, who portrays Thaddeus Stevens, a member of the Radical Republicans, and a strong voice for abolition in the U.S. House of Representatives. As usual, Jones gives a strong, humorous performance as a man who is not above insulting his Democratic rivals in the House to bring his point across to the people. He also shows that, despite taking a strong stance against slavery, he is willing to calm his rhetoric to get the amendment passed. This is definitely some of Mr. Jones' finest work, and deserves some recognition come Oscar time.<br /><br />Sally Field portrays Mary Todd Lincoln. I have to admit, I was slightly disappointed by Ms. Field in the role. She wasn't bad. She just wasn't as good as I thought she'd be. But she does manage to get some laughs, as well as some emotional intensity. It is possible that, had she had more screen time, her performance would have been more fleshed out. But still, she does a solid job in the role.<br /><br />There are several notable minor roles that should be mentioned. James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, one of the three men hired by the Lincoln administration to \\"bribe\\" several key Democrats to vote in favor of the amendment. He is a very funny character, and Spader does good in the role. Also turning in fine performances are Lee Pace as Fernando Wood, a Democrat who stands against Emancipation; Hal Holbrook as Francis Preston Blair, the Postmaster General who calls for Lincoln to attempt to bring the war to a peaceful end; David Strathairn as William Seward, Secretary of State, and Lincoln's closest friend in the cabinet; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Todd Lincoln, the President's oldest son, and a man who wants more than anything to do his part by joining the army, and; Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant. Although a very bit role, his performance comes off as very authentic, and he really gives you a good impression of what Grant was like in his short time in the role. The rest of the supporting cast truly does a commendable job in bringing this story to life.<br /><br />Tony Kushner's script covers a very short amount of time in Lincoln's life, from January to April of 1865, the closing months of the war. But in choosing to focus on this short amount of time, we get to see two of the most important moments in American history: the final abolition of slavery, and the ending of the American Civil War. Here, we get to see Lincoln as a husband, a father, a politician, and as a human being, and how his involvement in affairs brought about great changes in our country. The script also provides Spielberg with his most character-driven piece to date. While the script does occasionally drag in places, it provides a thorough and emotional look at the events depicted in this film.<br /><br />To me, there were only three weaknesses in the film. First and second, as already mentioned, are Sally Field's slightly disappointing turn as Mary Todd Lincoln, and the tendency of the film to drag at times. But these are not a major problems with the film. The third weakness is in the choice of actor to portray Robert E. Lee in the brief depiction of the surrender at Appomattox. While the scene itself is depicted fairly accurately, the fact that they chose to cast a man who, although he looks like Lee in the face, is rather chunky to play the frail, skinny commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, is somewhat distracting from the emotional impact of the scene. But again, this is a minor quibble in an overall moving film.<br /><br />Lincoln is definitely one of the greatest films made about Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War. From the amazing performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and an all-star cast, a powerfully-written script, to a moving finale, this is definitely the defining portrait of the man considered by many to be our Greatest President. If you have an interest in American history, or enjoy serious, thought-provoking drama, then Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is definitely a movie worth seeing.<br /><br />Grade: A-er's script covers a very short amount of time in Lincoln's life, from January to April of 1865, the closing months of the war.

B007THA4FI|2.0|This book introduces way too many characters, doesn't explore them deeply enough and leaves the reader with a sense of incompletion. Casual Vacancy needed more serious editing and someone should have been brave enough to tell J.K Rowling. She would have been better off going back to the drawing board and putting more work into this novel so that it had more depth and a stronger heart beat. If this had been her first work, I don't think she would have had the phenomenal success she had with Harry Potter. People paid to read this book based on her previous work. I can say that as a writer moving in this direction she has potential - in many ways her work resembles P.D James in that she shines a spot light on people as they really are, warts and all. But J.K Rowling has some distance to travel if she is going to move more in that direction and this is a book that doesn't cut it. My advice: borrow it from the library if you're curious, otherwise, send J.K Rowling a message: could do better.

1591841666|4.0|I didn't think it would be such a small piece since you can not see the thickness of the book. But the book is awesome. It's exactly what I wanted based on previews. I was thrilled and read it at once.
1401937268|5.0|This is a beautiful deck. I have worked with Doreen's oracle cards for years, loving their positive, gentle, and supportive messages. And yet, I was missing the depth and wisdom of the tarot. This the best of both!
0425206211|5.0|I cannot get enough of Jack Reacher, Lee Child's character.  I have read most of the Reacher stories and every last one of them are great.  Regarding the purchase from Amazon, the book came in a timely manner and was in very good condition as advertised.<br />Don Halasz<br />Plano, TX
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works very well. While I don't like facebook in general, nor do I really use it, I do pop on to see who is looking me up (the only way to do that is to delete all of your friends!) - and I do post a very rare temporary note on facebook as well from time to time.<br /><br />The app worked great.
B009AMALGM|1.0|The first three films in this franchise were very enjoyable, but this entry was awful. Obvious cash in that delivers nothing new at all. Doubt I'll be returning for a 5th entry after this letdown. Avoid.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded a more professional looking calculator but the top row of buttons was skewed so I deleted that one.<br /><br />I downloaded this one and it works great. The ads are at the top of the screen (I suppose because we look there for the numbers!) but they are not bad. You can ignore them easily enough and the calculator is great.<br /><br />It does not look as professional as the other one, and I imagine if you pay for it, you can get rid of the ads - and why doesn't Kindle Fire HD just come with one anyway?
0547884591|2.0|The book should be titled, \\"The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple and Fastest Path to Grave.\\"  Seriously.<br /><br />With all the hype over the course of months about this upcoming book, I was actually looking forward to it and planned to buy it.  Until I looked more closely at the description and until I reviewed today a copy that a friend got.<br /><br />Seriously, has Mr. Ferriss been living under a rock?  Does he have any clue about nutrition?!<br /><br />Ok, I am vegan and have been for a long time.  But one doesn't have to be vegan or whatever to get the idea by now that the kind of food Mr. Ferriss decided to teach to prepare is a sure and straight path to all kinds of chronic diseases and shortened life expectancy.<br /><br />Example: Want to lose weight? - Don't waste time on exercising!  Instead consume 30g of straight protein for breakfast each day as a strategy to lose weight!  This is the type of \\"wisdom\\" Mr. Ferriss offers.  And by the way, isn't that what the late Atkins used to promote till he died and it turned out he had heart disease and so forth?  Mr. Ferriss should visit his doctor to check the status of his kidneys, with this kind of nutrition.  Just look at his pictures.  He claims to be 35.  He looks like 45 at least.<br /><br />I understand that his book is much broader than teaching people how to cook.  It is about learning other things, effectiveness vs efficiency, and so forth.  But why did he choose to explain all that by teaching people how to cook and by choosing this kind of nutrition?<br /><br />Seriously, why in the world would you want to learn how to cook from Mr. Ferriss of all people?  And does it take six months?!  And does he have any clue that there are all these people who actually want to lead a healthy lifestyle and simply wouldn't be interested in this kind of nutrition?<br /><br />The pictures of Mr. Ferriss with all that meat and the exploding cow and the butcher and all that - how disgusting.<br /><br />There are lots of people,including me, who simply would not want to have this kind of visuals in their home, no matter what otherwise valuable information and messages the book may contain.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|I reviewed this earlier - or so I thought... I believe I got this for free, if I paid for it - I'll be angry.<br /><br />This game is one I want to love, but cannot.<br /><br />The graphics are great, you can change camera views to get to a HUD - which is awesome! I love it... but at some point in play, the darn thing flips upside down - not the plane, the screen!<br /><br />I tried it a few times... no good. Fix the flipping problem (that sounds funny now that I look at it) and this would be a great game. I have no clue why it flips and it might be my Kindle - who knows? - but that is a total wash for me.<br /><br />Other than that - for the first few minutes - great game!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Easy to use when I play scrabble! I like the way it is set up and even learning a lot of new words.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I can access Yahoo! Mail on the Internet, but not with the Kindle Fire HD - I don't know why. There seems to be an Android app, but Kindle can't use many of them - which ticks me off to no end.<br /><br />I might hack the Kindle. I never would have purchased one for myself, I would have got a tablet - but this was a gift. The Kindle is an EXCELLENT reader - but I do more than that on portable devices.<br /><br />Not being able to access Yahoo! Mail is not really a big deal - my smart phone can anyway, but it would have been nice.
0316044695|5.0|I've known about Marcus Luttrell for a while now due to an organization called the Boot Campaign. Over the last year I keep hearing, \\"you've got to read this book.\\" However, I kept putting it off.... as a mom of a young Marine I was afraid of how it might affect me emotionally. I'm so glad I finally broke down and read it!!! I read it in two days.... I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The book is very well written and Marcus' story is something straight out of Hollywood. [BTW -- they are currently shooting a movie of this book]<br /><br />This book will take you on an emotional ride.  Personally, I have NEVER been so moved by a book. Marcus' story is nothing short of amazing! His strength, and that shown by Seal Team 10 is beyond extraordinary. I cried a lot... and at times I found myself angry..... Angry about how little Americans show appreciation for our military. Anger over the media's liberal agenda and how quick they are to crucify those very men who put down their lives for their right to call them \\"killers.\\"  Anger and disgust over the  \\"rules of engagement\\" that the enemy uses against our men.... I cried for each and every mother that lost their son that day, for every mom that lost their son during the first attempt to rescue Marcus.<br /><br />Next time you see a service man or woman. Take a second.... thank them for their service, buy their lunch, remember and take to heart what they are doing for you. Remember Seal Team 10 and all those whom we've lost. They all have names... they all have grieving families.<br /><br />I just picked up Marcus' new book \\"Service\\" today. I can't wait to read it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|You can set alarms and the like with this clock as well as edit the look and style of some parts of it.<br /><br />I think it is pretty cool and the advertising (\\"free,\\" huh?) is not too offensive. Overall it is a neat little clock, I kept this app.<br /><br />Why, however, doesn't the Kindle Fire HD come with something like this built in???
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have been a fan from Postmortem, her latest books are filled with to much personal drama.  The earlier books kept my attention from beginning to end,  I find myself skipping paragraphs of Lucy, Milo and Benton.  I can see another book with whatever is now going on with Lucy.  No  enough.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|One of these is called Cupcake (I think it is anyway) - I reviewed it as well.<br /><br />I think they are different versions of the same thing. Either way, they allow you to get into the camera app on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The camera app is there - but for some reason, it is hidden (WHY!?!?). Anyway, this allows you to go in and find the camera and make use of it. I am sure it is useful for a variety of things, but I used it to get to the camera.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|\\"Limitless\\" may not be anything special but it's a heckuva thrill ride.  Director Neil Berger keeps the proceedings moving at a breakneck pace that causes you to stop for intermittent breaths.  Leslie Dixon's ingenious script is full of neat twists and turns with some deliciously cheeky humor.  Bradley Cooper's star continues to rise with his charismatic turn as a burned out writer turned super genius(not of the Wile E. Coyote variety) with the aid of some non-approved by the FDA pharmaceuticals.  Robert DeNiro steals virtually every scene he is in as a Wall Street power broker whose dual intentions are to tap into Cooper's zeitgeist and destroy him in the process.  Abbie Cornish is reminiscent of the ice blondes that Hitchcock favored in his heyday.  So grab a couple Monsters and enjoy the show.
B0058YPILY|5.0|The DVD set came within the estimated arrival date in good condition.  The box is a little worn, but the DVDs played fine.  I watched the entire season in a couple of days.  Now to go back & watch the extras!
B009P5S11G|5.0|First let me start by saying that I am impressed.<br /><br /> I became a Rihanna fan after her LOUD album. That album made me view Rihanna in a different light but with that being said, I can't say that I loved it BUT I was excited to hear more from Rihanna after that album. When Talk That Talk came out, it was good but average. There was nothing unexpected about that album...it did have a couple of really creative tracks but as a whole the album fell short in my eyes...it could've definitely used more time and effort<br /><br /> However, this album is like nothing that I have EVER heard from Rihanna before. Yeah, it still has some raunchy tracks, and yeah it has pop and dance music....but the SOUND is just sooo different.....she's definitely more comfortable in her own skin now and that maturity definitely shines through. I love almost every single track - which is rare for me - and the two that I don't love, I still don't mind listening to them. This album unlike the previous two I mentioned, has a lot of substance...and not in a heavy-I'm trying-too hard kind of way.<br /><br /> I think that the criticism for this album, is due to the fact that people were expecting the same old, same old from Rihanna - which to me is absurd because music is like technology, it needs to keep evolving. So I'm warning any future customers to listen with an open-mind, because this album is daring and creative, all the way from the type of songs she has on it to the type of collaborations.....it's just flat out creative, and if given the chance this album will blow your mind :)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I have read all her books. They just keep getting better. very impressed. I chose 5 stars because i just had a horrid time trying not to read it in one sitting. I am also telling everyone i know how wonderful a read these books are. Thank you because I have trouble being interested in books the deal with this kind of write because it seems to not have much imagination. Cassandra Clare can get you hook and waiting for her next with ease.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I Luv this game! So fun! used to play on the iphone, they finally have it on the app store!!! It's free! Download now!!! Leave a review!!! :)
0307341577|3.0|I read Gone Girl and liked it, so I decided to read this book. I liked the narrative structure of it and the writing was good. However, the ending was ridiculous, absolutely implausible. After 300+ pages, I have to say that I felt very let down by this author, and probably will never read her again. I want those hours of my reading life back.
B008CB9JJ2|3.0|Gives insight, if any is needed, into Auster's life and loves. A little precious but can one say that about a modern American great?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A quick, easy, fun read. Interesting as written from the dark side. Enjoyable twists and turns and quite a clever plot.
030746363X|4.0|This book is fantastic as it gets you involved and wishfull to do al the experiments.<br />It's remarkably well written, the author (or shadow writter, id that's the case) knows how to get your attention, knitting a strong emocional web that makes you want to be like him or accepted by him.<br /><br />It is also fantastic in the sense that claims are far from being seriously backed up by evidence. Although some (or all) of the claims might be true, the fundamental method of being accepted is emotional rather than scientific.<br /><br />In short, I recommend reading it and trying whatever experiments it proposes, it's exciting and fun.<br />I also reccomend being carefull to become a obsesive Ferris-fan and give up your criticall capacity to asses the things he proposes.
0316228532|3.0|Welcome to Pagford the home where politics is king, angst is in the air and gossip is second nature.  Barry Fairbrother has died and left a hole in the main frame of the political dynasty that has captured Pagford.<br /><br />First off I want to say that I have read a number of books from authors who both wrote YA and then an adult book and authors who have well known series and try a different story.  I grew up reading Harry Potter and was thrilled at the idea of seeing what else J.K. Rowling could come up with.  The Casual Vacancy is a story that is 70% masterful character development and 30% plot.  If you are looking to read a mystery then this isn't the story for you.  The Casual Vacancy is a snap shot of a small town going through political change and how Barry Fairbrother effected the town and her people.  The characters are wonderful and have very distinct voices and stories that you can get into.  It is very slow at first as you get to known each character but it picks up quickly once the stories are worked through and you get to know each of these people in the town.<br /><br />I did enjoy this novel but I am unsure if I would pick it up a second time.  There were times I forgot that J.K. Rowling wrote this.  Her narrative is similar to Harry Potter but much more adult.  There are a good amount of vulgar language and sexual situations so I would not recommend this to a younger crowd who loved Harry Potter.  It is natural to want that adventure novel that was Harry Potter but this is a 100% new concept.  I was able to put that aside as I read this book because of my past readings from other authors but I still felt like the book could have done more.<br /><br />Overall it is worth picking up and reading if you enjoy J.K. Rowling and want to see what else she can write but if you are expecting anything like Harry Potter this isn't the book from you.  If you are expecting a mystery novel who done it this isn't for you.  The type of reader who would enjoy thisbook is those who enjoy a less dramatic soap opera (or Desperate Housewives) of one of those reality shows that follow people around in their daily lives.  At the end you will be glad you read it and recommend it to a friend but I doubt you will want to read it a second time.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Absolutely mind blowing to gamers and all people! MUST SEE!! Everything to the coins dropping to the ground after enemies dying to the completely awesome special effects, BRAVO!!
B009MF56GC|1.0|Just finished Expendables 2. I think this just may be the dumbest movie I have ever seen.<br />Not only that but it is just horrible. The only good things about the movie are Van Damme<br />and Scott Adkins. The movie tries way to hard with the inside jokes and trying to give<br />everybody their little catch phrases and stupid comments. And really that is all this movie<br />is. The story is horrible, juvenile and pathetic.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|As per usual with John Grisham, I plowed through the book in a couple of days. Great story, cunning plot twists and as with all of his books, it has the pace of a runnaway freight Train!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have read quite a few books on Lincoln - and am re-reading \\"Team of Rivals\\" for the third time.  My wife and I saw this movie yesterday - and I won't bore readers with repeating everything already said in the 5-star reviews, except to say that I have never before felt like weeping at the end of a movie.  Even someone with no interest in that period of American history should see this film, and think seriously about the miserable excuses for leadership we have had in the last 20-plus years in the White House.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Took much longer to arrive than anticipated but the wait was well worth it for some of my favourite shows.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is such a fun app!  Glad I downloaded it. Great way to pass the time and may have to try the full version once I practice a bit more with this app. Very easy to follow along with and like the way you can choose the speed you want.
1615470158|5.0|If you have any interest whatsoever in PowerPivot then you have likely read Rob Collie's blog ([...) as in terms of serious web presence on the subject its really the only show in town. This book is basically the blog on steroids!    For the intermediate to advanced Excel user the good news is that you've basically been handed a free enterprise grade BI tool that you can deploy in days with little or no IT intervention which comes with an Excel style formula language which is so much more powerful than anything in Excel - CALCULATE() makes SUMIF() look like a Fisher-Price toy. The bad news is that a lot of the concepts are closer to SQL and relational database theory meaning a steep learning curve which is tough to negotiate without guidance from someone who has already made the transition.    This is where Rob comes in - not only in terms of how to achieve specific outcomes but also as the ultimate PowerPivot evangelist who will show just how amazing this thing is. As well as being part of the Microsoft team that actually built the thing, Rob has spent years working this stuff out whilst delivering projects for real clients meaning that he is uniquely placed to pass this on to his fellow Excel Pros.    The style of the book is very visual and easy going, there are no dry explanations of database concepts or theory, its all about real examples of everyday data analysis problems and how to solve them using DAX. Also included which is invaluable are the little tricks and tips such as using disconnected Slicers, HASONEVALUE() and Blank() which you are unlikely to see in any of the more theoretical books.    I totally recommend this book to anybody interested in PowerPivot and if you are using Excel you should be! Buy it.
1934030198|5.0|I loved this book as a first time triathlete. I know some people think it is overkill, but the book is really about understanding your strengths and weaknesses and writing a plan to address them. You can get as detailed or simple as you like and the book helps you figure out what that flexibility is. I would recommend it for any first time Triathlete.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Played on the Kindle Fire,  I used this game to wind down at night.  Lots of story --which I tapped right through-- for those that like a G-rated story line.  Same games as in the Pirate Adventures 1; amusing and easy.  One annoyance is the penalty for multiple taps when reason for tapping was that graphics were less than clear or images weren't logical.  However,  since the game allows approx. 8 minutes per task and it generally took me only a minute,  the penalty had no effect.  18 chapters and the game lasted several nights with only 3 chapters per evening.  Paid 2.99 and got my money's worth.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This review is not on the book, since Amazon is not offering the Kindle book on the quite popular Kindle Touch and Kindle Touch 3G.<br /><br />My son wanted to have this book on his Kindle, and as much I wanted to buy it, I could not due to Amazon's limitations.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ON KINDLE before you check \\"Available only on these devices\\". If you have a Kindle Touch (with or without 3G) you are out of luck.<br /><br />If Amazon is pursuing a policy of not offering books in older formats, are we suppose to keep buying new Kindles every time new books are published?<br /><br />I am terrible dissapointed, and I was hoping that Amazon would provide an explanation for this limitation, other than that they want to push us into buying the new Kindles.

B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is great for kids and adult fans alike. Gameloft absolutely nailed the aesthetic and sound of MLP FIM and for that I give them major kudos. Unfortunately, as soon as you start to build up your town you'll notice how horrifically unbalanced the cash shop is.<br /><br />I'm not above paying a little extra for something in a game I'm playing (that was free, no less), but I will NOT drop over 50$ to unlock one of the main ponies that are REQUIRED TO FINISH THE GAME. You read that correctly: one pony. You actually have to pay around 250$ to finish this game with the main 6 (the 6 main characters of the show), OR you can grind away for over two years (calculated) without spending a dime, but who is really going to do that?<br /><br />Parents, make sure your kids don't go buying themselves stuff with this app. It gets expensive extremely fast and for no good reason other than Gameloft relying on either bronies with too much money and too little sense, or tiny kid fingers pressing the wrong buttons and getting a sparkly new pony while their parents look on in horror. I work in video games, I know how free2play works and how a free game needs to make up extra revenue, but I also know how companies tend to abuse it and can see it from a mile away, so here's one for free Gameloft:<br /><br />Charge for aesthetics. Charge for things that people will WANT to buy as opposed to NEEDING. Gems for a main character? absolutely not. Grinding to get over 60,000 bits to buy a main character? I would have loved to see the exec announcing that to the developers. You've already successfully infuriated the majority of the MLP FIM fan base and I'm sure you've caused more than a few screaming matches between parents and little children.<br /><br />So, there you go. From a cartoon that brings joy on a weekly basis to people of all ages around the globe, to a game that will make children cry because they accidentally spent 250$ of their parents money on Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash.<br/><br />Congratulations, GameLoft. You've successfully managed to both line your pockets and make one of the largest fan bases on the planet hate you.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Those of you not able to see the final of Britain's Got Talent, you missed out on how much that Jonathan and Charlotte had grown from their first audition. This CD is a culmination of very hard work from these fine young people. I have been very pleased with my purchase and I have enjoyed it more after each time I listened to it. We have been given an opportunity to see this fine talent develop into a world class performers. They are that good!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This story is kind of along the lines of Douglas Adams goes supernatural.  It would of been hard to turn the pages, from laughter, if I didn't have an e-reader.<br /><br />Neil you need to do more books!  I've loved everything you have written.  Please write more.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie was a super deal! I was very pleased with how fast it shipped. It was in great condition when it arrived! I loved the two disc special edition \\"Amadeus\\" Movie!

B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I cried like a baby thoughout the whole thing.  I know that it was supposed to be a funny movie and it did have some parts that were funny, but not much in mu opinion.  I like my Disney movies a little more upbeat than this one.  At least it had a happy ending.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Seeing the preview of the film encouraged me to read this on my Kindle. The story developed like the ocean wave. A bit calm in the beginning and a raging storm as it progressed. A &#34;must read and discuss&#34; novel for Book Clubbers. Now I will see the film to know how they could handle the ending chapters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I couldn't put it down and was on my toes never knowing what was coming next. Brilliantly written.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|its really weird that the game knows everything charecter that was ever made! and all you people who don't have it you seriously need to get this game!!!!!!

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The game glitches constantly and it has forced me to reinstall it three times. When it's not glitching it's a fun game. Right now I would hesitate to buy a game from this developer.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|The graphics and flight engine are great for a smartphone app and wouldn't look too out of place as a flight game on the PC or a console game from 5-10 years ago. It is comparable to a flight game from a decade or two ago. However there are several things missing that would improve the game.<br /><br />The lack of the Inertial Landing System and FLIR make the night missions incredibly difficult. There are no guides to help with aligning with the carrier or airbase in the dark. The weather effects are nice though, with rain drops reducing visibility and wind creating a lot of turbulence affecting your direction of flight.<br /><br />landing isn't too hard with good weather conditions and the simulation controls feel on par with most flight games. Pitching, yawing, and rolling feel kind of awkward using my Samsung Galaxy S3, but it replicates a joystick or motion controller.<br /><br />I give it 3/5 stars because it lacks a few things that would have improved the gaming experience while increasing the level of realism (ILS, FLIR/night vision)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'll admit I'm a Grisham fan, and still, I found the beginning to be a little scattered for my taste. I almost stopped reading. Now, having said that, I did continue to read and soon found myself enthralled in a complex plot and riveting characters. I learned to  never judge a book before you finish chapter one!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the most interesting book on this subject that I have ever read. It bears witness in content to others like it but has a new depth. It left me with questions and I hope this author will follow with another book in the years ahead as he remembers more of what he learned. RECOMMEND HIGHLY
B0067RQYNW|4.0|This app used to be very slow and laggy, but because I was in search for a free word program, I decided to try it again. And I'm glad I did. Many improvements have been made and this is now a great program. I use it all the to e.
B009A9BF5G|2.0|Reading the other reviews, I keep seeing the word \\"Grainy\\". Only if I checked the reviews before blaming the media player software.<br /><br />I've been spending the past hour downloading different blu ray media players. I thought it was all these players and it's a real shame that I won't be able to complain about the bad shots, cinematography and etc because I will not watch a blu-ray in what appears to be even less than the DVD standards of today.<br /><br />I will keep this for the live CD, but this is the biggest disappointment as a Coldplay fan right next to the awful performance at this years Grammys, and the soon to be released MX comic series(looks plain stupid).<br /><br />I do not recommend getting the blu-ray version(nor the DVD) and just get the live CD version. Though if grain is not a problem and you don't usually notice the mediocrity in capturing and encoding in what is supposed to be high-quality video then go for it.

0547884591|1.0|41 reviews of a 672 page book, on the day of launch.  Most never reviewed anything before.  Now I'm going to buy the book as I enjoy his books but give me a break those reviews just are not genuine.  They make the author look bad and are of no help to the potential reader.<br /><br />I'll order the book today, and give a proper review when I can.  If you look through the \\"5 star reviews\\" the person who got an advance launch copy seemed to give a decent overview of what to expect.  This book is published by Amazon so the videos on the order page and Tim's blog will also provide relevant information to make your decision.<br /><br />12:03:12Alright as promised and lets keep in mind it's a separate issue from stacking the deck, how is the book itself?  Well depends on how you judge a book.  If you judge it on it's cover and print quality it's most definitely a five.  Whoever did the design, choice of paper stock, layout did a very good job.  The problem is we don't judge a book on it's cover and up to page 79 the book remains a one star book.<br /><br />This should have been his best book, after all he's written two prior books, has some experience under his belt and the premise of this book is a simple one.  Instead of giving you a fish, he's teaching you how to fish, no matter what is your taste, this technique will fulfil your wishes.  He quotes Bruce Lee's famous take what is useful, discard what is useless quote which is derived from ancient Chinese Philosophy at the start of the book so the criticism he has received from some reviewers is a little unfair in how it's been stated.  The book itself builds upon the premise of the four hour workweek.  In other words focus your efforts on what gives you the most payback in the shortest time.  He also gives an example of a 128 page golf book which boils it's subject down to it's essence of an example of doing something right.  The irony of course is that he's telling us this from the pages of a 672 page book which seemsto run contrary to his premise of getting to the essence of any subject.  The big problem up to now is he thinks he's a teacher and he's not.  He may be a great seminar speaker but that's not really teaching.  What the book doesn't do is follow an example up to fulfilment, showing that journey in different modalities that would then become an inclusive learning experience.  He doesn't check for understanding along the way.  It's more it's this and this and this but that was his journey.  What the book is up to now is good intentions, and valid points that lose some of their importance due to the muddy communication style of the author.  It's entertaining but it's not the book it could have been and should have been up to now.  Stay tuned.

B006P0FIGU|1.0|Easily one of the worst films ever made.<br />I sat through the whole thing with my 10 year old. Even she said - \\"Daddy, what in the world was this about?\\".<br />This disgrace of a flick is an insult to the action genre. The acting was some of the worst, I've ever seen. Logan Lerman has reprised his role as Percy Jackson, with about the same results. Perhaps he should take up knitting as a main source of income, because he sure sucks as an actor. Orlando Bloom has always been a Pretty Boy on the screen. I guess, if you can't act, you should at least have the looks, but even that is slipping. The rest of the cast didn't fare any better.<br />Cinematography is hysterically funny. It's like watching Pirates of the Caribbean 3 through the eyes of Jar Jar Binks.<br />I can go on and on, but why bother.<br />And that applies to this piece of celluloid garbage.......WHY BOTHER?!?!

1613822340|5.0|Now here's a book you don't read every day.  In fact I doubt anyone could get away with writing it today and getting it published!  Waay too many lawsuits!  Chesterton barely after the turn of the 19th century takes a philosophical and theological look around and systematically gives a heroic and epic earth scorching win for Christianity with great humor and sympathy.  He gets away with naming names, constantly poking fun and almost exuberant bluntness.<br /><br />I only got this book because I enjoyed Chesterton's biography - - otherwise I think I would have been intimidated by the title and even the solemn cover picture.  After reading the book I wonder if the author wouldn't rather want an outdoor full color cover with a clear blue sky and dancing figures . . .<br /><br />This book will have an affect on me for a while.  I was really surprised at how (except for the obvious local references to England) despite the startlingly confrontational approach, the philosophies and reasons for not believing in Christianity are very much the same as today, over 100 years later.  The discussion of \\"liberal\\" vs. \\"conservative\\" also seems especially timely because no one seems to dare talk about these words honestly these days without turning political and taking sides.<br /><br />All this plus the knowledge that Chesterton was actually personal friends with some of those he \\"calls out\\" for their atheism (such as George Bernard Shaw) seems to me extraordinary.<br /><br />About this edition - it was very clear with nicely spaced type, and absolutely no extra print or commentary, which I didn't mind.  Oh yeah - - two things I looked up . . . Hanwell is an insane asylum and mirth means gladness and merriment.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story is engaging and it's hard to put it down, but the whole thing is disturbing.  If I had it to do over again I'd probably skip it.  There's enough heart ache in the world -- I don't need to read books like that, too.
B009E3EY38|2.0|Hello Mr. Page, Mr. Jones and Mr. Plant (if you are reading this),  Please re-edit this DVD without the fast-changing camera angles, and then re-release the DVD.  This is a very pointless and stupid style of video editing.  This is a great show and needs to be edited properly without the picture changing every 3 seconds.  It would be much more enjoyable to watch.
0307346617|5.0|This was the first zombie novel that I ever read. I never even read much horror to begin with except for Stephen King.  The first person account format attracted me to begin with and I was hooked after reading the first couple of chapters.  The book has scares, some dark humor, and drama - something for everyone. It's very convincing and it is actually a decent thought experiment about  what would happen if we had something like this happen in real life. I recommend it for everyone.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is that the Kindle version is more expensive than the hardcopy version. There's no reason for that.

1400067936|4.0|This is one the first books I ever read on markets and trading. However compared to its reviews it turned out to something completely different. It definitely was not a kind of a book where you can just read and move on but a kind that actually makes you stop and think. I always had the impression that books about the market or the economy come with a baggage of understanding the material and concepts beforehand. Fooled by Randomness threw me back by the way Nassim the author, portrayed the various facets in which randomness and probability not only rule markets or trading but everyone's life in general. It was fascinating to see that such a world even exists and that people who are driven by profit do not always take a straightforward path.<br />Overall the book was interesting for a novice reader but definitely not an easy to follow book. There were many parts of the book where I had to stop and read twice or thrice to understand what the author is trying to say. It definitely shows you a different mindset of the Type A personality investment bankers and traders.<br />The book walks through various phases of how randomness and probability affect people from all walks of life. It is well divided into three major parts, each explaining different angles in which people view probability and randomness in their lives and how they deal with it on an individual level. The author explains well how perception and biases are responsible for people making wrong decisions. He talks about the fact that even though we cannot completely ignore emotions, we cannot as well completely remove probability and randomness while evaluating decisions and risks. The author also explains about the Monte Carlos simulators and how they should always be used to predict outcomes in the future rather than just relying on data from the past. The author also has strong views about denigrate history suggesting that people feel that things that happen to others might not happen to them. Nassim hasgiven a lot of examples to show the reader the various angles in which randomness and probability is perceived, used and interpreted by people. The author also draws light upon the fact that too much information might end up doing more harm than good as it blurs your decision and your ability to choose the right information. Nassim also strongly emphasizes on the fact that any individual should never get completely loyal to his position as it hinders him from looking at different points of views. This in turns affects his decision making and ability to adapt to the changes that come with the position. The author has given examples of people from his life, famous people throughout history as well as people from various field of work to prove his point in several occasions. The author finally suggests that it is inevitable to be affected by randomness as he himself has been affected by it. However whatever the effects of randomness in anyone's life, they never should blame anyone or get angry but just learn to deal with and change is always inevitable.<br />The book has been written in a very personal format where it feels as if the author is trying to convey a message through a personal talk. Talking about experiences in his life and sharing his emotions definitely helps build that connection with the author. The author's style seems very straight and blunt as well. It feels like he has no qualms about how he has experienced life or what he has thought about some people who he has met in life. This is clearly seen in way he expresses feelings about some of his neighbors, coworkers or even people he has heard about. It gives a sort of raw understanding into the mind of the author. In doing so he has been able to sort of organize his book in to the various aspects of randomness, its effects and biases that come with it and finally how several people deal with it. This sort of structure helps in understanding the complex message that the author is trying to convey.<br />There are quite a few quotes that got me thinking, some of which are: \\"Mild success can be explainable by skills and labor. Wild success is attributable to variance.\\", \\"Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behavior, not because they won or lost.\\", \\"A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point.\\", \\"The only article Lady Fortuna has no control over is your behavior.\\". However my most favorite line from the book is \\"No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.\\" I love it because it made me think and realize that this applies to so many things in life. Your reputation that you build upon for so many years can all come crashing down with a major mistake. Nassim explains this with an example of a successful banker who earned millions for a bank however a single mistake that cost him millions got him fired and forgotten of the things he had done in the past.<br />After reading through the entire book you have a sense of confusion mainly due to the fact that it does stay close to its name that there is a lot of talk about randomness that exists in the world and the market. However Nassims ability to convince the author is promising. He himself believes that he was fooled by randomness and consciously tries to make certain decision that help him in making the sound decision.<br />Overall this book has great things to offer from head scratching content to knowledge to even humor at times and is definitely worth a read. It helped me step out of my comfort reading zone and challenge me in my thoughts and opinions that I had about various aspects in life.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The only thing so far that I don't like is waiting 3 minutes for my energy to build up and then I only get 1 energy to use.  Maybe waiting two minutes but get two energies would be better.  So far I haven't earned cash.  We get coins for harvesting things and I refuse to use real money to buy cash in any on line game.  So if there is not a way to advance without a real money purchase I will be deleting this game too just like I have a couple other games.  So far I am pleased and enjoy the game for now, but time will tell.

1616960922|5.0|The Emperor's Soul is a wonderful book. It is short, yes, but powerful and very entertaining.  As usual, the magic system Sanderson has created is unique, intriguing, and thorough. And just plain cool. The concept of trying to recreate a person's soul is very clever and Sanderson explores it well even in the short span of the book. And the characters are great. Shai is intelligent and intuitive and interesting to read about. Sanderson even throws in several tidbits for the hardcore fans that connect this story to some of his other novels that are just fun. Sanderson fans are sure to find this a satisfying addition to their library. And for anyone else this is a great place to introduce yourself to this great author. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

B004XISI4A|1.0|I wish I had just read the reviews and  not bothered with the book. Many of them have somehow managed to compress 1000+ pages into 10 at the most. How is it possible that people have condensed it so much when Martin couldnt?<br /><br />Clearly he needs to fire his editor/s. And maybe try and care about the story just a little.<br /><br />It seems that almost any reviewer here could do a better job than Martins.<br /><br />Maybe someone could write a 200 page condensed version where our fav chacters actually live. But I have had enough of this sh**. Who could even be bothered? Thats all i'm left with now that the anger has faded. Apathy.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case is the best everyday case I have found for the money. It's great in many different ways. First of all it's cheap. It's probably the cheapest case I've found. Second, it protects. I dropped my iPhone 4s about 12 feet, onto concrete, and the phone survived without a crack. Third, it doesn't get in the way. I also have an Acase which attracts lint and makes a glare on my pictures when I used the flash in the dark. With the Amazon Basics case there are no such issues. No lint, no issues with the camera flash. Pictures turn out perfect. It fits easily in my pocket and it doesn't add a lot of bulk or extra weight. I think it looks cool too. The only downside is that it doesn't cover the ports, so it could be vulnerable to sand or dirt. If I was planning on going to the beach or somewhere dirty I might swap it out with my Acase, which plugs all the ports. If the Basics case somehow covered the ports it would get 5 stars.

0374214913|5.0|Our fearless narrator becomes employed in Mr. Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore.  \\"Penumbra\\" is defined as \\"a surrounding or adjoining region in which something exists in a lesser degree\\".  That is where this book takes place - in the penumbra between our new technology and Books - or \\"Old knowledge\\" aka \\"OK\\" as it is known in the  tech field.  What Mr. Sloan pulls off is a loving ode to both - neither OK nor new technology wins out.  There is a place for both and both can be loved by the same people, no matter how diverse their interests seem to be.<br /><br />The way Mr. Sloane gets there is intriguing from the outset.  Jad, an unemployed designer, takes as a last resort, a job as the graveyard shift clerk in a bookstore open 24 hours per day.  It soon is obvious that the sales of the books is not the object of the store.  Rather, it is denizen to an exclusive club - or is it a cult of some sort of sorcery?<br /><br />Let me get one thing out.  I do not like fantasy and I do not like books of wizardry.  This book comes close to both, but does not cross the line.  It is more of a cryptological mystery with some undertones of the cult.  Most of all, it is an appreciation of both the new tech and the old knowledge.<br /><br />Our clerk soon learns that there is a mystery and a pattern to the books borrowed from the three story library of books that were old and indecipherable.  With the help of his computer, he learns the first part of the puzzle.  This gets him partially into the secret group.  Then, as in real life, half of the members of the group want to use the computers and half want to only use old knowledge and the human brain to get the answer to the puzzle.  We get characters from Tolkien and Google teaming up to try to hash it all out.<br /><br />There is a plot and a mystery in this book.  There are also interesting characters of all sorts, but all believable.  Most of all, it is watching the blending of the new - from Google and Kindles - with the old - booksand 16th century printing presses - that make this book a triumph.  Mr. Sloan does not takes sides in the battle between the page and the computer screen.  Rather, he paints a story in which both are fully appreciated.<br /><br />This is a wonderful well-written book perfect for this time.  We are entering a Christmas when many will get e-readers and many will get books.  There will be many arguments at dinner tables about the virtues of both.  Mr. Sloan argues through a highly entertaining novel, that the combination of the two transcends wither one exclusively.<br /><br />I highly recommend this very different novel to all who appreciate good writing, good stories, high tech and low tech.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|This score by John Williams is beatifully done. It never intrudes but rather supports and amplifies the drama. Musically simple on the one hand and complex and surprising on the other, the score yet again demostrates a masterful composer at work. The world's greatest Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with solo performances by its members is extraordinary, aided by the fantastic acoustics of Orchestra Hall. Capturing all of this and transfering it to the soundtrack deserves special recognition. While this score is not \\"rousing\\" it is by turns touching, interesting, and in the end the mature John Williams at his best. How fortunate we are to have his talent and inspriation with us over these many years!

B0061S073A|3.0|Put this in the 3yr old's kindle because it has preschool games & books in there & I wanted to prevent him from removing them. Using a locking system cuts out tantrums much like a timer.  However there are serious glitches.<br /><br />1.  I have to reset the timer every time he turns it on. It just won't stay set.<br /><br />2. Several apps just disappear every time it's turned on.  So some of his apps always load while others I have to manually put in each time he opens it.<br /><br />3. Sound control is irritating, I really don't want to use a password - no matter how easy it is - to adjust sounds ALL the time. Some apps have quieter sounds, others are louder.<br /><br />4. No books.  I can't put any of his books in this for him.  Only app styled books.

B009A9BEHU|3.0|The music is good. I just don't think they executed this whole thing right. The audience in Stade de France was lacking, at least this film made it seem that way. I've been to one of the Mylo Xyloto shows, and I thought the one of the best things about it is how the audience really gets into show by singing along with the songs. In my opinion the band sounds best when the audience does that, and this film lacked that. I don't know if its because of the editing of the audio or the concert goers at Paris just don't know what to do at a Coldplay concert. Also, some of the editing and cuts are a little too over the top. The camera movement is a little too much at times too.<br /><br />I guess, I'm not really all impressed by it. The Glastonbury concert that was shown on TV was much better than this. If that concert had the Xylobands and the current setlist, I think it would have been the perfect show for this film. The audience in that concert was fantastic and really brought the whole show to life. The content besides the concert itself is good though. I like the little insights on how things are done behind the scenes and what the band members' thoughts are.

1401224792|3.0|For those Fables fans who wondered what Bigby was up to when he was sent out on his mission to find a new place to settle Fabletown: Bill Willingham delivers with this story.<br /><br />However, the art is something else entirely. Detail inconsistencies between pages (or lack there-of) and colors between panels. (Trying to avoid spoilers, so I will stay as unspecific as possible.) At one point, I felt they had just blown two smaller panels up, to be full two-page panels, in order to increase the page count. Although the story itself was great, it was hard to follow at times because of the quality of the art and layout.<br /><br />I hold Fables up to a higher standard than I would other comics. It is, without a doubt, my favorite comic book series. Fables has won 14 Eisner Awards, and honestly, I expect a better drawn book. (Something at least in line with the rest of the series.)  However, I still feel let down after waiting over a year to read Werewolves of the Heartland. The drawings felt rushed. This is the first time I have rated a Fables anywhere below 5 stars.<br /><br />I would not recommend this story for those new to Fables. Start with TPB #1, and move yourself forward to this point in the story. Graphic violence and a lot of nudity as well, so keep away from younger audiences. Again, great story, and less to be desired art (from something within the Fables universe.)However, still worth a read, so dive in.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|I had a love, hate relationship with this book.It dragged on too long, I was glad it was over, but on the other hand I did finish it.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|Rather than attempting to intellectualize and come up with some high brow, wordy review,I will say this music FEELS 4 1/2 stars to me.Shades of purple zeppelin swinging high on a trapeze with a fresh 21st century twist.Rolling like this, the next one should be an easy 5 stars.
0696204800|4.0|A basic book, a must in the library of a quilter.<br />Collect all kinds of blocks, with multiple techniques: piecing, appliqué, etc..<br />The book also includes projects, which allows you to take more of your interesting content.
B009MF56GC|1.0|I liked the first one. It was good, funny, well acted.<br />This one was a disaster. Badly acted, badly written, dumb plot.<br />I wanted to like this movie, but sadly thats impossible.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Enjoyable storyline with great graphics. Games are challenging but not frustrating. HOS screens can be difficult at times for me to see clearly on my Kindle Fire but are still doable. I highly recommend this game.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I bought this item to sit on my Xbox 360 as I am a big Halo fan. Seems to be made well. One note, the pin on the rifle that allows you to snap it onto his back broke the first time I tried to put it on his back. Now he hols it, no big deal just thin plastic. Oh well.

B0092YRYBS|5.0|The first few times I listened to this album my impression was that it wasn't as good as the first album.  But after a few more cycles it has grown on me and I like it just as much as the first.  Best of all about the Deluxe version is that it contains the live versions of the songs from the first album played at the Brixton concert.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|A welcome return to form from Grisham after the sheer self-indulgent tedium of his last outing, [[ASIN:B007CH7UPM Calico Joe]]. Here we're back to his old territory of crime and the law but with a twist. This time we're following the story from the perspective of Malcolm Bannister, jailed lawyer, who claims to know who murdered hard-line Judge Raymond Fawcett. The plot has plenty of twists and turns and takes us on a trip from Virginia to Miami to the Caribbean. Although it becomes apparent fairly early on that all is not as it first seems, Grisham keeps the twists coming so that there are still some surprises in store at the end.<br /><br />While very readable, I found the book slow in places, especially near the beginning. Also none of the characters were particularly likeable, not even the good guys, which left me a little indifferent as to the outcome. But the complex plot was very well worked out and as always Grisham makes up for any weaknesses in his characterisation by his detailed descriptions of the way the legal system in the US works. My personal preference is for when Grisham takes a more humorous light-hearted approach, such as [[ASIN:B005OKTPKC The Litigators]], but this is an enjoyable stand-alone novel - recommended.
B0084ZFASK|1.0|PD James owes an apology to Jane Austen and her readers. I bought the unabridged audio version of the book to entertain me on a very long trip. To say I was disappointed would understate how I felt. I was annoyed and upset that PD James had made such an appalling hash of a story line she decided to adopt (or rather adapt). It was quite simply awful. The story itself is extremely weak, boring and unlikely in just about every way.<br /><br />None of the characters, except perhaps for the Wickhams, are recognizable from the original story. Darcy is a poor shadow of himself. He is not the masterful Darcy who we expected to grow even more in confidence though perhaps with a little more compassion, having Elizabeth by his side. He comes over like an effectual pansy. Elizabeth has lost her feisty wit, it just never shows - not once. Colonel Fitzwilliams becomes an entirely different person. Even the glimpses of Lady Catherine reveal a different and unlikely person.<br /><br />The dialogue between the characters is stilted and sloppy. PD James contrives long, boring, unnatural monologues for the characters that are just unbelievable for people who are supposed to be having conversations with other people. The tone of each character is the same, explanatory and condescending.<br /><br />This, however, might be partly the fault of the narrator, Sheila Mitchell, who was incredibly bad also. I don't know how old Ms Mitchell is but she  made Jane and Elizabeth sound like they were 60+ year olds, though the book is set 6 years after their respective marriages. Then there was no discernible difference in their voices or the voices of Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam or for that matter Wickham. The narrator gave every character the same odd, annoying explanatory inflection in their voices, I wanted to scream at times. The whole experience is one I wish to forget, but I wanted to warn other unsuspecting readers/listeners, don't waste your time or money. This book will only irritate you. There is no joy awaiting you in this horrid tale. I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews, I'm sure I would not have spent my money on this!
1471310388|5.0|I doubt if there's been a Christmas season in the last thirty years that I haven't read, watched or listened to A Christmas Carol, in some form or another. Like King Lear, every actor reaches a point in his career where he wants to stamp his mark on this classic, so you have to be really quite special to compete with the crowd. Fortunately, this reading by Tom Baker IS really quite special!<br /><br />I approached this with some trepidation because, much though I like Baker, for me the definitive version is Patrick Stewart's and I doubted Baker could match him. I was wrong - Baker brings drama, fear, sorrow and ultimately joy to the story just as much as Stewart does. As with all of the best of the Dickens' narrators/performers, (Callow and Margolyes, as well as Stewart, spring to mind), Baker has a huge personality and a powerful voice - necessary to fill the shoes of Dickens' larger-than-life creations. Although this is a straight reading, Baker uses his fine acting skills to give each character an individual identity. I enjoyed the occasional background music and other sound effects at the more dramatic points and felt that they added to the overall performance.<br /><br />I intended to listen in instalments but by the time the first disc ended, I was so hooked I ended up listening to the whole thing in one session. Not better than Stewart (not possible!) but as good, and of course this is the unabridged version. Three hours of pure listening pleasure - this set will now join my select collection of Christmas Carols, to be brought out and savoured time and again over many Christmases to come. Highly recommended.

B0070ZJT4Q|5.0|It is Neil MacGregor's passion for sharing his enthusiasm and knowledge that makes this book such an enjoyable read. I heard a few of the programmes when he presented 'A History of the World...' on Radio 4 and was surprised at how interesting he could make a discussion of objects that we couldn't see. The same thing applies to the book. Although there are small black and white pictures of each of the objects and a few colour plates of some of them, mostly we have to use our imagination based on MacGregor's descriptions. This doesn't detract from the interest though because in reality the objects are merely jumping off points for MacGregor to discuss the various cultures that have arisen and faded during humanity's reign over the world.<br /><br />Each bite-size piece focuses on one period of time in one place but they are grouped into time periods and themes which show the different cultures which shared the planet and how they interacted, or didn't, with each other. For me, this was a novel and very effective way of looking at world history. Like most Brits, I expect, my knowledge of British and European history far outweighs my knowledge of the history of the rest of the world. MacGregor uses themes such as The Rise of World Faiths and The First Global Economy to show the differences and similarities of what was happening across the world at roughly similar times, and to show how trade and commerce influenced almost every part of the world by disseminating ideas and values along with goods.<br /><br />At times I felt I wanted to know more about a particular subject and found that a little frustrating, but this book could be seen in some respects as a taster to inspire the reader to look for more extensive histories of the cultures and periods that most interested him/her. Enjoyable, educational and inspiring - what more could you ask from a history?<br /><br />PS The title of the review refers neither to Mr MacGregor nor myself thankfully - but to George Smith, first man to decipher the Flood Tablet - Chapter 16.rst man to decipher the Flood Tablet - Chapter 16.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I generally enjoy Grisham novels, and I read the sample (a few chapters), and I thought it was the premise for a promising plot.  The novel moved well for the first half of the work, and I was interested in how his main character would work himself through the maze of conflicts he seemed to have created.<br />I don't want to give any plot away here, but suffice to say that,Bannister, his protagonist, is in jail as the novel begins, knows he is innocent, and knows exactly what will get him released early.  For me, that's when the novel gets very messy, with many improbable \\"twists\\", which, for me, seem contrived and illogical.  (It seemed that the author was just trying to get finished with the book, and said, \\"Well, I guess I could throw that idea out there!\\")  I was not happy with the last third of the novel and felt it could have been much better.  I would give it a \\"C\\"
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|What a joy to have my old friend Rebus back and on top form! For the first time in my life I feel I have to thank the government for putting up the retirement age, so giving Ian Rankin this opportunity to resurrect my all time favourite policeman. Curmudgeonly as ever, but with dry sense of humour very much intact, (...to a woman with multiple piercings who refuses a drink - 'Pity, I wanted to see if you leak when you drink'...) Rebus is now working in the cold cases unit. But when a young girl goes missing he makes a connection with a previous disappearance and quickly finds a way to shoehorn himself into the current investigation. The case involves several disappearances all linked to the A9 road, so Rebus is forced to leave his Edinburgh comfort zone and travel into the small towns and rural communities of the north. As he points out, he sometimes feels he's never been this far from a pub in his life.<br /><br />The old characters are here - Siobhan, still unable to do the sensible thing and cut her links with her maverick old mentor; Big Ger Cafferty, like Rebus semi-retired, but still with a finger in every criminal pie. But we also meet up with Malcolm Fox of the Complaints - since Rebus has applied to rejoin the force, Fox has been tasked with checking him out and is convinced that his links with Cafferty are a sign of corruption. It's a neat trick of Rankin's to show us Fox from the other side in this book - to Rebus he's the bad guy and it's very enjoyable to see the old fox outrun the new one.<br /><br />I enjoyed both of the Malcolm Fox books hugely and hope Rankin does more of them, but oh, the pleasure of having Rebus back...I hope the government puts the police retirement age up to eighty! Highly recommended.

B001JRB16U|5.0|I bought this movie for my children because I remember loving it when I was younger. It's a classic and fun for the whole family, as long as the children are old enough to understand what they're saying. I found that my four year old had a REALLY difficult time without help from me beacuse of the accents, rate of speech, and word choices. I guess I'll put it on the shelf for a couple more years then revisit the magic. :)

B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Panther provides a very thorough and realistic portrait of contemporary Yemen and the variety of complex issues confronting the United States in the middle-East. It also has a plethora of the John Corey wisecracks that make him such an enjoyable companion.  What it does not have is a convincing plot and story line.  The ostensible evil terrorist, the Panther, turns out to be a minor character who is so lacking in charisma and credibility that the pursuit of him seems hardly worthwhile.  In fact this novel is a continuation of the earlier conflicts between Corey and his wife and the CIA.  Readers unfamiliar with those will be confused and distracted by some of the plot twists.  Finally, this turns out to be a routine--bad CIA versus good guys- story which is both lackluster and too long.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|We bought this set for $20 and only watched the first Alien movie so far, but this has been well worth the purchase price.<br />-<br />I've only seen Alien on TV whenever it was on and watching the Blu-Ray version was like watching a completely different movie.  The Blu-Ray version is just that much cleaner, crisper and detailed.  There is absolutely no graininess and it looks like it was a recently made movie, not one made in 1979.  Of course, the technology on-board the ship gives the age of the movie away though :) Oh and this was also the first time I saw the Director's Cut so that was cool since there were a few scenes that were new to me.<br /><br />The entire set comes as sort of a book casing with the discs embedded in its pages.  It works out, I don't see any issue with it and aesthetically it looks pleasing with the rest of our DVD collection.<br /><br />There's some kind of a special feature you can turn on which was kind of confusing so we haven't explored it yet.<br /><br />This is a great bargain for fans of the franchise! (Or for even those who like the first two movies, like me)
B0090X4GLW|5.0|THE DISC WHAT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND IT HAD NO SCRATCHES OR DAMAGES FROM THE SHIPPING. I ENJOYED THE CD VERY MUCH AND I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game was fun to play- a good mix of seek and find and puzzles to solve.  I can't wait to try the sequel!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I had never heard of this series until I watched the Emmy Awards and they ran away with most of them.<br /><br />Being a lover of a really intellegent comedy series, I decided to give it a try, and bought the first season.  I have to admit I needed to watch it more than once to get a real feel for the characters, but once I did, I was hooked.<br /><br />I intend to buy additional seasons and watch the new ones on TV as often as I can.  The characters have really grown in the last 5 seasons.  All in all, very enjoyable.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset.  it is extremely comfortable and funtional.  I have a few Beats Audio headsets and have used Turtle Beach headsets.  This is by far better than Turtle Beach.  The sound quality is no where near Beats Audio but no much is.
1439152799|3.0|To me, Kate Morton is a great writer. She has great perception and I love her decriptions of things and people and situations. I just felt there was too much of it in this particular book. I wanted to get to the juicy part and it took foreeeever to get there it seemed. I didn't have a hard time putting it down and coming back a couple of days later. So it just didn't stick with me. When I closed the book my first thought was it reminded me of the TV show Cold Case. It was interesting and fun but not my favorite. I am getting ready to dive into The Secret Keeper and am hoping that one will be more gripping like The Forgotten Garden. :-)
B002RXZF6C|5.0|I have seen many snippets and spoofs of this movie, but it was fun to see the original (on Halloween night).  Recommended.

1469984202|5.0|I don't read a lot of sci-fi since much of it is badly written or weirdly plotted.  This is VERY well written, and the plot is....challenging.  Just buy it, enjoy it.  You're welcome!

B00138CT16|5.0|The music is relaxing and generates the feeling of the vast plains.  I enjoy listening to the songs to recall the epic nature of the film as well as to just enjoy the music for what it is for.  John Barry has a great talent spanning from 007the to the Dances With Wolves.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|If you were around during the mid 60's and HitchHiked across this Country you would have a True sense of how John James Rambo felt as He entered this town.The Locals usually came in contact with you before the Sheriff did ...... well the movie is very accurate on that part.It is good that there is only ONE Rambo because there would not be any towns left in a particular part of the Country if there were more! I really enjoyed this film ...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this book twice in four days and loved it each time. We lost our beloved cat last year after six months of weekly fluid<br />therapy treatments (sort of like dialysis). When we finally decided to let him go, I could see the relief in his eyes as he closed<br />them  for the last time. Maybe if I had read this book earlier, Enzo's story might have convinced me to let him go sooner.<br />He gave our family twenty wonderful years and we were with him until he took his last breath. Thanks, Enzo, for the look inside an animal's mind.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I knew it was for adults but wasn't expecting such a downer.  Not sure what the authors purpose was. Life in a small town?  No happy ending here
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I enjoy Relax Melodies for the sounds and ways you can mix them.  Not perfect only because some of the musical ones are not great.  However, most are very nice and blend well with nature sounds.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I usually don't like to see movies before I read the book, but in this case, I was unaware that &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; had print origins. I enjoyed the movie, but wanted to know more, so I went home and immediately bought the book on my Kindle.<br /><br />I really liked the book. I enjoyed it immensely. It was interesting and thought-provoking, providing things to think about and dropping clues in every part of the story. It was a cleverly formatted novel, with a simple but powerful message, which I appreciated. I would recommend this book to people who are willing to imagine, don't mind a large cast of characters, and people who either are willing to sit down for a long read or want something that's a little more broken up. &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; gets a thumbs-up from me.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have been playing ice age village for while now.<br />it's easy good clean fun. I have been having fun getting the challenges completed.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone.
0547884591|4.0|When I read the Table of Contents, I was disappointed thinking it seemed more about cooking than I had hoped. But as I read the \\"Why Read This Book\\" section and continued to turn the pages, I was again thrilled by the content Tim Ferris pours out. He makes every subject fun. As always, I really wish he'd clean out the F-bombs; they detract rather than add to his content. But the book is filled with gems and has piqued my interest in areas I've never even considered, such as training my senses for taste. While teaching how to cook like a pro, he takes you on fun tangents that feel like mental breaks, but are really geared to the true goal of the book: Tim's how-to-learn approaches that inspire the joy of life-long learning.<br /><br />It is fun, inspiring, educational and beautiful.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Price was out of line for the pages. Like Grisham but he is not God. Several other writers are much better.

B006QPX7UI|5.0|Even though the movie is over 4 hours long and has substantial problems with continuity, it is still well worth the investment to watch it.  Martin Sheen delivers a softer spoken Gen. Lee which really plays into the Southern Gentleman role he had with his army I believe.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|it was a long game but not to long! it's a lot of fun. i wonder if they have a second one? anyone know?<br /><br />it was easy to follow
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I finished it yesterday night. I could not believe it.<br />Very good novel. Tremendous story of corruption, politics, addicts, life destruction, and misery. Harry seems to have been reborn like the Phoenix... Rakel seems to be there.. for him.<br />But life is not fair for anyone. If Nesbo is a magician, I hope for the next novel. If not, I'll be really sorry.<br />Harry is a lovable character. Even in his brutality. In his despair. In his alcoholic bouts. He is GOOD people. But seems like he cannot change the path..

1452101248|5.0|I read the reviews for this book, thinking it really couldn't be that incredible. I found it at the library and checked it out. WOW !!!! This is a gorgeous book. It's huge, the pictures are lovely, the recipes are inventive, simple, full of flavour, and really enjoyable!! It gets you eating your vegetables again and loving every minute of it!!! Totally recommended!!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|The cover has very little protection as it is very thin and has no padding to protect the glass. Not a good buy for the money spent.
030745455X|5.0|This book and the two that surround it are so full of excitement and suspense, they are all very hard to walk away from!  If I had any complaints, it would be that the foreign names are a bit harder to keep track of.  This is adult reading, but I do recommend.
0385342063|2.0|I'm a huge Sophie Kinsella fan and have read every single one of her books, but honestly I was disappointed with this book.  It was sorta boring and wasn't her usual page turners.  Will still keep reading her new releases though.
141659521X|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book. I love the whole Vince Flynn series, he's great.<br />Read them in order, starting with &#34;Term Limits&#34;.<br />Although this book kind of stands alone, it's better to know the history of Rapp.<br />Mitch Rapp is the guy you call on when you don't want to know what he does, and you're the CIA.<br />The story takes place between Afghanistan and Pakistan with our, ahem, ally's.<br />Deceit, deception, money, fear all play into the plot.<br />Bodies are piling up. Time to send in Rapp.<br /><br />But, don't buy it on the Kindle. I bought the hard cover.<br />Consider, you can pay $14.99 for the right to read a text file on your Kindle, and own nothing,<br />or, you can buy the hardcover for $15.68, own it, then give it to a friend.<br />So, you money grubbing publishers who could have made $10 on the Kindle,<br />will instead get $8 from two readers. And I'll still own the real book.<br />Where's your Steve Job's &#34;Jedi mind trick&#34; now?.

B004EYT932|5.0|Great oveview of eight centuries of government folly.

B000X1BPYQ|5.0|With Theogonia, RC went back to the roots, and by that I mean all the way back to Ancient Greece. The spoken word at the beginning of The Sign of Prime Creation quotes directly from Hesiod's poem Theogony (written around 700BC) and the lyrics run along the same lines of who begat whom. The wonderfully hummable Greek-language chorus is sheer genius, as it single-handedly establishes Greek as a language of black metal.<br /><br />Black metal is arguably the subgenre of metal most concerned with ethnic identity. If Norwegian black metal focuses on exploring the great disconnect between Christianity and the traditions of Pagan Scandinavia, this album is so much more ambitious, by drawing from the very core of Indo-European civilization (it's hard to go back further than Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation myth, written sometime between 1,700 and 1,100BC). But where there is angst and brooding in Norwegian black metal, the tone of this album is defiance. Christianity never vanquished these roots.<br /><br />After this ridiculously ambitious statement, somehow Sakis &Co. managed to come up with memorable music as well, heavy and relentless but also melodic and their most coherent and cohesive album to date. Judging by how fresh it still feels almost 6 years later, I have a hunch that it will age extremely well. We knew from Nile that 3,000 year-old verse was heavy, but who could predict it would also be this catchy?! Wonderful work.
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|IT was so nice to have access to the original illustrations and maps with this book... I've always appreciated older books for that, and it made me feel like I was reading an old book, rather than an eBook stripped of any extras.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I watched all of season one just in the month of October 2012. I bought the season on Amazon. I loved it! I'm a huge fan of horror. I actually heard about it at the beginning of October in Denver, CO while my boyfriend and I went to visit the haunted houses there as they were on the top ten in USA. As soon as we got back I got into it. I wasn't aware that season 2 wasn't going to be a continuation of season 1 so I was a little disappointed at first. Come to find out, I have far more enjoyed season 2! It has a lot more suspense. The first season was interesting, but the second season is just amazing. It has a lot more \\"horror\\". I can't wait to finish the season & then get into season 3:)

My favorite songs are: Army Of Me, Red Hot Kinda Love, Your Body, Empty Words, Sing For Me, Cease Fire, Around The World, Shut Up. Circles happens to be my favorite right now, I find myself in a situation where I can relate to this song. Make The World Move, Let There Be Love, Blank Page, Best Of Me, Just a fool I enjoy listening. Is this album worth purchasing yes it is, it has fun catchy songs that make me bobble my head to the ballads which of course showcase Christina's talent in  fact I have been listening to this album for 3 days straight now, Christina your album is awesome congrats girl!!!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Hes one of the best to come from AI. Pre-ordered this right away. Its smooth and a classic. Put this in your cd player and ride or smoke.
1449417051|5.0|A friend gave me this book for my birthday.  I laughed all the way through it.  The Bobcat comic is great!
081299471X|4.0|I guess it's my fault for not checking the book dimensions more carefully, but I was disappointed in the size of the book and the resultant small print size.  I guess I'll just have to buy the kindle version to be able to actually read it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I really like all but one or two songs on the CD.  I would put them in the same general category as Mumford but with a little more 'softness'.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|HAD TO ADD THIS TO MY SATRIANI CD COLLECTION. GREAT STUFF. A MUST FOR ANY SATRIANI FAN. A TRUE GUITAR MASTER.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It's movie Is amazing. Love it love it love it. It's not the actual stage production but a watered down &#34;concert&#34; version. Even without all the stage production it's an amazing show and any fan or budding fan ( my 7 year old niece loves it) will enjoy it time and time again. I misplaced the disc for a week and tore my house apart to find it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|A must for any Led Zeppelin fan. These guys prove they still got it. I don't buy many CD's/DVDs, but there is no way I could pass this deal up. If you weren't one of the lucky ones to see this live in 2007, then this is the next best thing. No one rocks like Led Zeppelin !!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|What a story. It is really wothed to see it. I know that you will enjoy it. Try to see it.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|I never thought that I would enjoy watching a series about a serial killer. The acting is great as is the writing. I am watching the current series but wanted to watch it from the beginning.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|Before I purchased the book I read a lot of reviews I noticed a lot of them said the book went downhill after the first two chapters, I disagree.  As a small business owner it really made me think about numerous things that I have applied to my business. This is one of those books that need highlighted and notes made, then use them in real world meetings take your reader along and quote things.  Good read all in all did not give it 5 stars becuase its one of those reads that you can put down.<br />Buy it, read it use it.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I went to see this movie in the theater. As a fan of Scott, Fassbender and the Alien series I was very much looking forward to this movie. I left the theater in a daze. It looked amazing, enchanting, so dazzling in fact that I at first thought, \\"I guess I just didn't pick up on all the subtle clues that would've made the story make sense.\\" I spoke to friends and discussed that maybe all these questions would be answered in the sequel or in a extended cut Blu-Ray, but as time went by and the special effects and CGI wore off I grew more resentful. A question answering sequel, that's just lazy storytelling. A extended cut, that would be admitting you screwed up the actual movie. I couldn't make sense of the plot, the characters, or why the film purposely avoided any payoff. I came to the realization that I wasn't stupid, the movie was. There is some stuff in it that I like and the money shows on the screen, but why put so much effort, effects, and great actors into a movie when you don't have a coherent story or believable characters? I give Ridley Scott more credit then this so my only conclusion is that he must not have gotten a chance to see the film before it's release. There are just too many inarguably stupid scenes. (see other reviews) From now on, for me, this film will be the poster child of bad writing. When I heard the same writer is working on World War Z, a Max Brooks book I loved, I was crestfallen. So much potential wasted. A beautiful film built on a garbage script. I could debate this movie forever, but it's not worth it and besides I found this video that hilariously summed up all my arguments and more.<br /><br />[...]
B007MU85D0|5.0|heard little talks on the radio and had to buy the album and i love this album! def get it
B008G59IKO|1.0|When Green Day announced they were making not one, not two, but three new albums to be released over the span of five months, the small portion of the world that still gives a flying rat's behind about Green Day did what we all do when bands announce such ambitious projects like this: brace themselves for a disaster. Furthermore, when Billie Joe had his little meltdown on stage back in the fall, it was only a hint that this album would end up being nothing more than a vanity project for Joe. And everyone was right on both counts.<br /><br />That's right, despite Mike Dirnt's face being on the album cover, both this and it's Predecessor UNO! Are all entirely Billie Joe centric. If I had to guess, Billie Joe must have written all the lyrics and riffs and just hired Mike and Tre as session musicians, because neither would be capable of putting out such atrocities as this. If I had to make a comparison, remember when you were a kid and your neighbour's dad embarrassed both himself and you by trying to show off how cool he was? That's exactly how this album feels. Billie Joe is 40, has two kids and you'd think that he'd show a bit of maturity in the songwriting department if he's going to be a dominant force of the three albums. And even if this album is supposed to be a breakaway from the bloated boring rock opera stuff, and back to basics old school stuff, you'd think he'd show a bit of maturity there.<br /><br />Well, there's two songs that show just the slightest smidge of maturity. The opening track, \\"See You Tonight\\" is a very nice Beatles/Simon and Garfunkel sounding intro that does set the (false) tone and leads you to believe that this will be a good album. Problem is, it's immediately followed by the unfortunately titled \\"F*** Time\\". Even the title alone just makes me want to cry. I nearly chucked the CD into the trash the first time I read the title, but I decided \\"never judge an album by a song title\\" after all, and listened. And it was exactly how I thought it would be- boring three chord trash with immature lyrics. The next track is decent musically, but problem is, it uses the whole \\"word vomit\\" thing I mentioned in my review of UNO!. \\"I'm drinking the Kool aid/I jumped on the grenade\\". Really? is Armstrong even trying anymore?!<br /><br />The rest of the album isn't much better in terms of lyrics or music.  Alright, I guess \\"Stray Heart\\" might be decent lyrically, but is sonically an insult, with the boring three chord progression that just does nothing but solidify the trilogy's status as the new \\"St. Anger\\". Yup, that's right, Metallica. St. Anger doesn't look so bad anymore, we have a new sinker in our midst. And such proof can be found on tracks like \\"Lady Cobra\\". Or the hokey and boring \\"Wow! That's Loud\\".<br /><br />But it gets even worse, believe it or not. If you haven't ingested vats of rat poison and cyanide by the time you reach \\"Nightlife\\", that song will really push you over the edge. If you thought \\"Kill the DJ\\" was bad, it's a blessing compared Nightlife. It's essentially \\"Kill the DJ\\" but with added rap. That's right, RAP. The rap wouldn't be so bad if it actually added something to the music, but it doesn't it just feels forced. And by the time album reaches \\"Amy\\", which is an acoustic ballad that's a tribute to the late Amy Winehouse, you're wondering what the point of releasing a trilogy of crap is. Amy is the only good track on the album and it's absolutely beautiful lyrically, yet even that song is musically in pretty gory shape.<br /><br />Like it's predecessor UNO! and most likely like the following album, TRE!, DOS! has no reason to exist, will not attract any new fans to the and old fans will probably just dust the album off their shoulders. Hell, when KISS makes a better album than you, you really need to rethink your position as a musician.it would be- boring three chord trash with immature lyrics.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|I must have lucked out, or maybe because  I pre ordered for the initial release, but my set was perfectly shipped, and each record is perfect.  I didn't even have the too tight sleeve that Michael Fremer complained about.<br /><br />Apart from the packaging problem, Michaels issue was that the recordings were not transferred from original master recordings in ultra high resolution.  Mind you - his turntable alone is close to $100000.<br /><br />That said,the 24 bit master makes a big difference, even if not at highest sample rate. This sounds much better than the CD 2009 reissue set which were  mastered at 16 bits.<br /><br />I have a fairly high end system:  Benz ref 2 silver cartridge, Tube phono, pre amp and amp, and Avantgarde Duos.<br /><br />The 180g records are all dead quiet, with no warps.  I only have one original recording that is not beat up - Revolver.<br />I A-B'd it back to back with the one from this set.<br />While it sounded slightly more airy,the new copy was much quieter, and pretty close in resolution.<br /><br />So I believe you will appreciate this even if you are in the Lunatic fringe audiophile category.<br /><br />The only way to get better is to sort thru hundreds of older originals from the 60's and 70s, pay hundreds for a hot stamper from better-records.com(which I'm not sure are all that much better), or pay upwards of $1500 for the long out of print MSFL edition.<br /><br />Based on the other reviews, I would assume that you may have to return some of the LPs so make sure you listen to them all within Amazons 30 day window.<br /><br />As for me - I'm keeping mine and enjoying all this music again.  If you have vinyl - buy this set as it sounds much better than the 2009 digital remaster.<br /><br />update 12/11:<br />finally got thru all the albums and found Let it Be has excess vinyl on the outer edge that interfered with the outer ring clamp, so returning for replacement.  No actual problems playing without the outer clamp, so would not be an issue for most users who don't use an outer clamp.<br />Definitely a weird quality control issue - I've never seen this in the 1000 or so albums I've had over last 30 yrs.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Its been a long time since Grisham hit a home run way out of the park. This is it. The plot goes west and the finish line is east. Characters are easy to picture in your mind. In the binging you get a feeling that its not going to work for you, then just a few pages and its out to the races.
B005LLXBYA|3.0|Kind of cool if you're into old school underground club disco.  I bought it out of curiosity but the music is definitely not any of the hits I remember.<br />The album covers are pretty nice however if you like young naked British black girls.

1935670913|1.0|I HAD to buy this book for college and the more i read it the more i feel disgusted. This \\"author\\" is a perfect example of why art is dying. He promotes the sacrifice of art to make money. The only thing that he cares about are money. He himself states that he doesn't care if his writing is not good, the important thing is to sell- as he said: a good book is the one that sells. He even dares calling William Shakespeare \\"Billy\\". Poor us. This person has definitely screwed up everybody. I think it's almost criminal what he does. People stop thinking and start make money because this is the only thing that really counts in life. That's the message that he's sending to me. I'm a classic literature lover, i love every kind of art, and reading this bullshit makes me feel just like how much miserable this world is becoming. He's an insult for every intelligent person, he's an insult for the art of writing, and he's also arrogant... Are you kidding us???<br />Seriously disgusted.

0345803485|5.0|Hi, ok... Before I bought the book I sure read many many MANY reviews, and they surely didn't stop me from reading it. This is by far the best book that I've ever EVER read. This review is coming from a girl who doesn't like books or reading, I'm 17 years old and I've probably read about 10 books in my entire existance.. those ten books might be: Charlie in the chocolate factory (good one), this judy bloom's one I can't remember the name of it, but it was so cool, I read Twilight and New Moon, The Hunger games, Ana's story, Miles to go, this book of a teacher I can't remember the title of it either, and this other two I can't remember the name of but one was from a doll and the other one from a real life story.. Anyhow back to GREY.<br /><br />I read Fifty shades of grey, and to be honest the only part I got bored and was for like 3 pages was reading a contract.. THAT. IS. IT. ! THE BOOK IS AMAZING! I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED IT. I've read Fifty shades of grey, and fifty shades darker.. missing the last one.<br /><br />I'm serious when I tell you that NO book has EVER gotten my attention as much as did book did. Like NO JOKE. read it, and if you don't like it, well then you didn't. but in my opinion its outstanding!

The pictures are great and you can tell heart and soul was put into this book.  Tim is a great teacher and gives great case studies and real life examples.  His recommendations are worth the cost of the book 10 fold.  Don't be led by people complaining about many reviews on launch day.  I have been following his blog since his first book and can tell you from first hand experience he is true on what he says.  He does have a large following so of course he will receive many positive reviews, to be expected from quality content.  Any doubts?  He has an amazing blog that enough should say it all.<br /><br />A great book, I can assure you that you will learn at least ONE thing that will make a long term difference in your life.  What is better than that?<br /><br />Cheers!!!

B006LSZECO|2.0|The story ended abruptly, as though someone had ripped out the last chapter from the book.<br />I felt like my time was wasted.
0525478817|5.0|I've been a fan of John Green since I discovered my first Vlogbrothers video a few years ago, and I've enjoyed his various literary efforts. To put it simply, there is a lot of really bad young adult fiction out there, a lot of Mary-Sues and bad plot lines, a lot of stories that really do not need to be told. The Fault In Our Stars is a particularly delicious cupcake in a land of squashed muffins.<br /><br />I think it is important to note that I was not completely smitten with the book on my first reading. I cried, sure, we all did, and I was left satisfied but not completely blown away. At first glance, the book was simply a good one. I appreciated Augustus' metaphorical resonances and his desire to be a hero, I loved Hazel and An Imperial Affliction, but it was just a book.<br /><br />This is perhaps a little bit personal, but over the summer I ended up writing a disgustingly long fan fiction inspired by this book. Somehow what was supposed to be 6 chapters turned into 26 and this book became my unofficial bible. I read it, really read it hard, and found beauty in the metaphors I'd missed the first time and the prose that told complicated truths in the simplest of ways. On the surface, The Fault In Ours Stars is merely a novel about two teenagers falling in love, but upon deeper examination it's about how we live our lives. It was about appreciating our big and small infinities, about realizing that even beautiful boys die and fall apart and there's nothing beautiful about that. It taught me that love is the most important thing you can have, that we can't help people caring about us, and that sad endings do not detract from happy middles and beginnings.<br /><br />It taught me how to care for people, it took my stupid cynical heart and crushed it into nice bite sized pieces. Sure, it was a little bit cliched and sappy, but it was cliched and sappy in the most beautiful manner and for me it worked. Augustus, the dream boy turns out to be incredibly flawed, he's annoying and destructive and Hazel is lonely and dying. It is not a perfect love. It is not a perfect novel. This is not a perfect world.<br /><br />So sue me, I love this book more than anything. The flaws in its characters and the improbabilities presented in it only make it more endeared to me. I can't even adequately put into words the meaning I have found in TFiOS, intended or not. It is not a likable book, it tells you truths you always suspected but never truly put into words. The Fault In Our Stars is truly one of the best books I have ever read, so I beg of you: Read it. Read it again. Find your own meaning in the infinity between its numbered pages.

B000FA675C|2.0|As with most people who read this book, I got swept up in all the brouhaha about it. The plot was interesting and the few tidbits about symbols kept me reading a bit further, but this book really fell flat in all other areas.  The characters are two dimensional with no real depth, most of the information about what the symbols stood for is flat out wrong, and it seemed that the main driving force behind the novel was the notion the Jesus and Mary were married and had a child.<br /><br />Now, I wouldn't mind reading a book that theorized about a wedded Jesus, but this one certainly isn't it. I personally don't believe it happened, but I have heard some valid points for it happening and none of it appear in this book. Sensationalism aside, this book isn't worth the time and there are much better written works out there that are far more rewarding.

Since it is on my phone it is with me all the time.<br /><br />If you were a \\"dyed in the wool\\" HP RPN calculator user you will be quite happy to have this product on your phone or tablet!<br /><br />The mere fact that I have it on my phone is \\"causing\\" me to do a lot more calculations as time goes on.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|somexpeople think its terrible but the game requires patience which obviously some people don't but that's ok they just should play a different game
B001P06GX4|5.0|Blokus is a great game.  Really makes you think about what moves you want to make in order to lay all your pieces down.  Our family really enjoys this game.
B001HQZJP2|5.0|I would say that all {3} of these films are pretty good. The Blu-Ray quality in all {3} are really nice. I'm glad they were all done in 2:35:1 or 2:40:1 aspect ratio so you can see more of each film. I can only say that the audio sounds good to me, but I listen through external speakers run from my stereo. Nothing fancy, just good old stereo sound. I still prefer Rachel over the new girl in the 3rd film. There are plenty of special features on all {3} discs although with the 3rd movie you get a bonus disc with extra features. Overall I am glad I bought this trilogy & believe you will like them too. Much better than the Dvd's.
B009E3EY38|5.0|After a long wait from the December 2007 concert at London's O2 Arena, the final Led Zeppelin concert that was done as a tribute to the late Ahmet Ertegun is here for all to enjoy.  This CD/Blu-Ray/Theater release contains 16 tracks that serve as an overview or greatest hits collection over the band's legendary career.  Each song is done to perfection, with and incredible amount of poise, power, and undeniable energy. I was surprised at the chemistry and tightness between the members, especially after all these years of not playing together.  Robert Plant still has the golden voice that is unmistakable. Jimmy Page can still effortlessly produce riffs and solos that are mind blowing. Jason Bonhom, playing an exact replica of the drum set his dad, John, used to play is powerful and right on track.  His timing and poise with John Paul Jones is very impressive and he easily surpassed the expectations that his late father left behind. One of the surprising and strong points of the album, is the playing of John Paul Jones. John Paul Jones's bass playing is aggressive, strong, and done to perfection. Listening to the performance in the DTS-HD Master Audio really brings out the punch in the bass and rhythm sections.<br /><br />  Celebration Day is almost certainly to be looked upon as one of the greatest rock albums - concerts of all time.  This is the crowning achievement of all the members of Led Zeppelin at the top of their game, firing on all cylinders, giving all they got and the result is an epic masterpiece. This release is an absolute must see and must own for any hard rock fan.  If there is a School of Rock, Led Zeppelin undoubtedly shows they all have PhD's. The level of execution and performance shown in Celebration Day shows the gold standard that countless thousands of musicians have tried to achieve, but have failed miserably to reach. If this is the last time Led Zeppelin will ever perform, they will leave countless millions world wide wanting more and they will be sorely missed.  However, if this is the last song by Led Zeppelin, they did it exactly right by saving the very best for last and after all...you cannot improve on perfection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this show a couple of months ago at the recommendation of a friend.  After watching the first episode I fell in love with it. Telling my wife about it she wanted to watch episode 2 with me.  Now we have watched every episode and can't wait for the next one to be released.  Season 3 has been wonderful, the characters and storylines just keep on keepin on.  It really is a must watch show, Season 3 included.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A great follow up from Bared To You. This picked right up whereit left off. Can't wait for the next one!!!

2070321029|1.0|sorry, but this author is NOT good.  This is supposedly an autobiography, but all he knows about himself is to list names and addresses of people who were friends of his parents.<br /><br />It is like the phone book! Loads of names and even phone numbers for some people. What, am I going to call someone in Paris in the 1950s?<br /><br />I had to read this book for a class, and it is bad bad bad!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|As I was reading this book I was in such a hurry to figure out where these characters were heading too. It all comes full circle at the end. This was so much better then Bared to You!! Sylvia Day definitely knows how to engage her audience. Awesome book!!
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I'm struggling to get through this painfully boring book.  I thought it would be better, so far, no luck. screw flanders!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book had just about everything that 50 Shades of Grey had, however, what this book had that 50 Shades did not was more relatable characters. Both leads have past hurts and damages that need to be repaired. But the love and passion for each other isn't as consuming. That is what I feel is lacking. Don't get me wrong this was an awesome book!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I don't know why this game is so much fun but it is.  It's very addictive.  I just wish the Horse Frenzy game would open.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|What a cast! The story is told with a wry humor (Maggie Smith delivers some great lines, as always). While I enjoyed the movie overall, I found it a bit too long... as the end approached there was as much relief (that it was over) as eagneress to see how it all worked out.
0446585025|5.0|I love Ellen.  She is so funny.  If you watch and love Ellen there is no way you won't laugh at this book.  She is frankly honest and that is what makes her so good.  I have all her books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it!  Works great on my KindleFire and i find myself choosing this over  my other games, including my former Spider game.
B003WTE886|4.0|I do like Taylor Swift but I am not obsessed...I don't generally even listen to this type of music but I still gave it 4 stars because she is truly an artist.  I appreciate her because she writes most of her own music unlike most young stars who don't.  I recommend this and it's great for children too.  She never swears or says anything crazy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are simply incredible. I first joined them as a founder, and get their first album. Now I bought this one, and can't regret anything. The songs are perfect, emotionnal and inspiring.<br /><br />Thank you guys, see you on Youtube !
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is an interesting album because it's only 3 guys and sort of creates a new &#34;band&#34; if you will with John Mayer as the lead guy still, but the other 2 guys are still a part of his band,  So the music doesn't sound completely different than his usual stuff but it does have a distinct different sound, pace, and rhythms.  They really rock out in this album, do buy this.

B004Q7E0TA|4.0|This story was truly written from her heart.,  It is awful what she went through.  She is a great write and a great actress.  If anyone has an eating disorder this is a must read.  I don't have an eating disorder but I am still glad I read the book because it really opened my eyes up and this is a true and awful disease.
0316044938|3.0|Good book, but I wish I had read it before I ever saw the movie. Movies are never made to match the books, but otherwise  the quality is good.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|If you love or even like baseball, this is a must see movie.  Brad Pitt is great in this movie and the plot is based off a true story and just a great story altogether.  Great price and fast shipping.

B000UNYJXQ|3.0|I know some parts of this move were true but it soooo bias because of who directed it.  Please don't let this be your only opinion on American healthcare.  It's not perfect but this movie leaves out all of the benefit and successes in our healthcare system which is still one of the best in the world.  If he hates it so much, he should move to another country, because let me tell you he is overweight and will need some healthcare in the future.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its not good because when you go in a room you find all the same stuff all the time and you have to wait like a day for your energy to rebuild up waste of time please don't get it
0470449756|5.0|I read this book front to back and did every single problem and I passed the GMATs the first time.  Well, you don't really pass or fail you just get a grade, but I felt like it was a high enough grade to apply to business school and I got accepted after my very first application.  This is essential and was so helpful and gave me enough confidence to take the test.  BUY THIS.

B0082FPIY8|4.0|Some people want this to be a travel guide. It's not. It's a story about real life that happens to resolve itself, to some degree at least, on a trail. That's all. It's an Excellent story. Well written. Fun, funny, sad, happy. Real life in other words.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Despite what he has been going through in the media, he really pours out his heart into this album and has a different feel compared to prior albums.  I really love this one...it's more toned down but does not in any means make you more bored listening to it.  The lyrics are actually more interesting.  If you like John Mayer than do buy this album.  Added bonus:  Taylor Swift guest sings with him on track 3.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I was really looking forward to PROMETHEUS last summer, but I wasn't able to get to a theater to see it. I had to wait until the film came out on DVD.  It finally did, but, of course, the studios have figured out that they can make more money if they don't put any &#34;Making of...&#34; features on the standard DVD but only on the Blue-Ray DVDs. So, while I would normally only buy a standard DVD, I've had to buy the Blue-Ray combos to get those features (on films like &#34;Super 8&#34; and &#34;Hugo&#34; as well).<br /><br />Ridley Scott has long been my favorite director, going way back to the &#34;Duelists&#34; and, of course, &#34;Alien.&#34;  I had heard the rumors that &#34;Prometheus&#34; was an alien prequel, so I was anxious to see it. Unfortunately, I found the story a bit confusing and underwhelming.  I would have liked more backstory on the aliens and what they were doing on that moon.  I felt some of the characters lacked the depth and humanity of the the first &#34;Alien&#34; movie.  Production wise, Ridley was in top form.  And, of course, the SPFX were the best you could have.  But it all came down to a muddled story. I loved the set up, but I felt there wasn't enough follow through on the mystery of how these alien signs/symbols ended up on different parts of the earth.  Maybe I'll like &#34;Prometheus&#34; more after a second screening, maybe it will make more sense, but I doubt it.  It is still a film well worth watching and pondering, just don't expect an &#34;Alien&#34; experience.

B004WPT3ZM|1.0|The sound is dull and missing something on this remaster. I have the original on cassette and it sounds better as for the live cd on disc 2. Its a really bad recording of a concert from that era. I own this unfortunatelly.

1439192812|4.0|My children are fascinated by this book and it looks set to remain a favorite for the forseeable future.<br /><br />The basic concept of presenting real 'magic' with vivid prose and illustrations is great, and generally the book succeeds.<br /><br />For me, its main flaw is that of being too dismissive of mythology. I believe neither in religion nor in any other supernatural ideas, however I believe myths to be fascinating, wonderful and a hugely important part of human history and culture. The smug attitude of \\"oh isn't it silly that people believed that!\\" is disingenuous and adds nothing to the work.<br /><br />My other small criticism is that the topics selected seem to be somewhat random, with  no logical progression; it does read a little like the author has pulled out some favorite articles and pasted them together to make the book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the style is mostly very engaging, the subject matter interesting for my elementary school kids, and the pictures are beautiful. Well worth buying for anyone with children, or adults who didn't learn much science as a kid.<br /><br />NOTE - I HAVE STUPIDLY POSTED ON THE WRONG EDITION - I bought both one hardcover version and one paperback, and the paperback didn't have the color illustrations. If you're going to buy it, especially if you have kids, please consider getting the hardcover one as the pictures really do add a lot to it.

0547884591|3.0|Tim Ferriss tells you right off that this isn't a book about cooking, just like Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance isn't about Zen or changing oil. He'll teach you how to handle a knife and make a few interesting dishes, but mostly he takes you on a long, strange, self-indulgent, and sometimes useful trip.<br /><br />What I enjoyed:<br /><br />-- Ferriss's storytelling. He has a nice way with words: \\"Mangalitsa acorn-finished woolly boar tasted just like acorns. I was chewing on fall, clear as crystal, in a sliver of cured ham.\\"<br /><br />-- His emphasis on the slow food movement and local, organic farming. (But strangely, his \\"Clean 15\\" foods include sweet corn, which is mostly genetically modified.)<br /><br />-- His language hacking tips, which are gold. I've always wanted to master several languages and found his methodology solid and logical.<br /><br />-- The 140-character Twitter recipes from almost every country in the world: fun, simple, and intriguing.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />-- Ferriss's tangential teaching style. At one point he goes from braising to English's 100 most common written words to kickboxing to chess to tango spins in order to emphasize the importance of selection and sequencing. It didn't work for me, because I often lost track of the original concept.<br /><br />-- His foray in into survival and hunting skills, just so you can make your own venison burger. (If you want some cricket protein bars, however, you'll need to mail order the crickets.) This section could have been a separate book and might have been fascinating as a metaphor/methodology for learning entrepreneurial skills.<br /><br />-- His unrealistic (for the busy person) science experiments, such as making arugula spaghetti using a syringe and flexible tubing just to avoid that dreaded white flour. (Though some of his cocktails in the same section sound delicious.)<br /><br />If I were to sum up this book in one word, it would be \\"manic\\": excessively enthusiastic and somewhat disorganized. Ferriss is obviously a curious and driven guy. I came away feeling he gets satisfaction from the ability to tackle and master anything, but not joy.thusiastic and somewhat disorganized.

1936719118|4.0|I loved this book for one reason, that it's a book geared for empathetic people who want to pursue their business goals.  Derek Sivers uses real life examples to illustrate the values an beliefs that his previous business's, primarily CDBaby.com were built upon.  I discovered this book by stumbling onto Derek's youtube series, &#34;Uncommon Sense&#34;, if you haven't already seen the videos then check them out.  But be warned because if you get deep into the videos and then buy the book, you'll find that the book and videos cover a lot of the same topics, leaving a little bit of a insufficient feeling.  Other than that, really valuable book and I didn't mind buying this book at all.  It supports a very supportive person, so I believe Derek is out there paying his profits forward.  :)
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I fell in love with Mr. Hudson, Mrs. Bridges and Rose  immediately.  So sad that the series is no longer.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I heard about this album when it first came out, but didn't take the time to pick it up because I've always been lukewarm about Norah Jones.  But this album has a much darker sound than her earlier stuff and I have been listening to it on endless repeat for the past two weeks.  amazing.
B008OOYALE|5.0|very fun and not at all slow for me. I reccomend it to everybody!  breeding the dragons is fun. awesome
B004DNWPY4|4.0|This book is getting dated, but the message is solid and very useful in todays world of over-spenders.  Stories of how common people living within their means, save money and become millionaires.  The approach to how money is viewed is critical.  Don't waste money and don't spend money you don't have and don't worry about &#34;keeping up with the Jones.&#34; The long section on cars is a little over done, but this is important as so many people borrow money to purchase a vehicle.  This is a bad investment - actually it is not investment, but a money pit.  Yet due to the widespread purchasing of new and expensive vehicles by so many people, I guess this needs to be stressed.  Myself, I very much like nice cars, especially Porsches, but I only buy what I can afford to purchase with cash.  Again, this is a very useful read, especially for young people who want to become wealthy.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This will be short but not sweet! As much as I look forward to a new Grisham book this one is in a different pile. Can't help feel he was being pushed by a deadline.

B00973DDN2|1.0|I saw in a critic's review something about the Killers being the last 'arena rock' band around and ordered this disc based on that review.  After all, I've been happy with them in the past, right?  What a letdown. They are just getting worse with age. Some of my favorite songs of the last 10 years came from these guys.  I have a disc in the car & iTiunes playlist called 'Essential Killers' with songs like Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf, Jenny was a friend of Mine. and 14 other awesome tracks. They do not get old.  BATTLE BORN sounds like light FM music that you never heard of & don't need to hear.  Ever.  Boring as hell.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I have listened to the Piano Guys since my son showed me one of their videos.  They take such joy in their music that it comes through in each performance.  &#34;Cello Wars&#34; is the version with the accordion that Darth Vader plays.  Fantastic music, very well done.  Enjoy.

0345803507|3.0|Fifty Shades Freed is the third book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy by E.L. James. Christian's intentions for Anastasia to become his Sub have magically evaporated and, fast forward, they are now married an on their honeymoon in the French Riviera. Unlike the first two books in the trilogy, in this book, quite a bit more happens besides the formulaic sex, of which there is still quite a lot. Christian is still being a control freak, but now, with good reason, as Ana's ex-boss Jack Hyde seems to be out to get them. So apart from yachting and jetskiing on the Riviera, clubbing in Aspen, a new Audi R8 as a birthday gift and renovating a house on the Sound, there's also another encounter with Leila, an accident for one of Ana's nearest and dearest, a pregnancy, Mrs Robinson makes an appearance, an engagement, a kidnapping and ransom situation, Ana shoots someone, and at least three people end up unconscious. But Ana meekly tolerates Christian's mercurial moods and volatile temper and really, it could be retitled Fifty Shades of Slow: the wedding night description is tedious, the dialogue, nauseating, and that's just the first 30 pages. If I read any more about biting of bottom lips or speaking silkily, I may well throw up. This book, unlike the others, relies on flash backs to tell part of the story. The Epilogue fast-forwards three years, then also includes some flashbacks to finish the story in a bit of a rush. There is a 29-page section at the end titled Shades of Christian, which describes his first Christmas and the first few encounters with Ana from Christians POV. Thank goodness that's over: I couldn't let it beat me. Slightly better than the first two........

B00466HM28|4.0|This controller was easily integrated into Sonar X1, and it does what I need it to do. It's good for developing ideas, maybe not ideal for live performance. The pads are responsive and easy to program. The keys feel solid and durable, not like a toy keyboard like I expected. The keys are not full-sized, but this presents no problems for me. I have skinny fingers, but I could see it being a problem for someone whose fingers are a little fatter or stumpier. Overall, happy with this purchase.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Clerks was/is his first film of director Kevin Smith. Coming from a fan of Smith's, I have to admit, this film is just hilarious, no matter what generation you're from (whether it be X, Y, or Z). The film follows the daily life of two best friends, Randall Graves (played by Jeff Anderson), who runs the non-fictional video store, R.S.T. Video, which is right next door to his friend Dante Hicks' (Brian Christoper O'Halloran) workplace, the Quick Stop Groceries convenience store. Outside both their stores, \\"live\\" 2 drug peddlers, Jay (played by Jay Mewes, Kevin Smith's best friend) & Silent Bob (played by the film's director, Kevin Smith).<br /><br />About the DVD: This 10th Anniversary DVD is just awesome, loaded with hrs. of extras, including the very 1st cut of the film, before it hit theaters in 1994.<br /><br />Although this film is in B&W, it is still funny, regardless of whether or not it's in living colour (sorry, NBC and FOX, I just had to say that.) If you love Kevin Smith, buy and watch Clerks.
B000002IR7|5.0|This is just to dispute the customer reviews that write this 1962 album off as being useless save for the title song. It's listenable through all 12 tracks, and at least half of those will embed themselves in your memory as deeply as \\"Green Onions\\" if you give them chance. This is a band that was subtle even when it was showing off its formidable chops. The slow, bluesy takes on songs like Doc Pomus' \\"Lonely Avenue\\" and Ben Tucker's \\"Comin' Home, Baby\\" are wee-hours classics. These guys were so good, they even make \\"Stranger on the Shore\\" sound sexy.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I saw Madagascar when it first came out, and fell in love with it. My favorite character in this flick is Gloria, the hippo. Jada Pinkett Smith, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and the others do a hilarious job! There's even a hidden reference in this movie to another one of favorite movies (from the same company, DreamWorks, nonetheless!), American Beauty! If you've seen that film, you'll get the joke. With that being said, there's something for everyone in this movie and some of DreamWorks' other films (Live-action and animated!).

B0027CNFR4|3.0|I love all of Jane Austen's books and wish she had lived longer and written more.  A lot of people feel the same way and so \\"Austen Spinoffs\\" are very popular.  However they seldom live up to the originals, expecially when it is a sequal to a spinoff, like THE EDGE OF REASON is a sequel to the spinoff, BRIDGET JONES DIARY.  Some Jane Austen spinoffs REALLY stink, and I have to say that in comparison, THE EDGE OF REASON isn't actually all that bad.  I was mildly entertained for an evening and I got a few laughs.  But it just doesn't do it for me like a \\"True Jane\\", and by the next day, I was having a hard time remembering exactly what this movie was about.<br /><br />I don't especially get the populaitry of Bridget Jones, since apart from the bare plot paralells and play on names (like Darcy) the actual sense of the story is far from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  Bridget Jones is in no way similar to the intelligent, poised, witty, self possessed Elizabeth Bennett.  In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is easy to see why Darcy falls for our Lizzy, but I keep wondering what he sees in the grasping, silly, promiscuous, annoying and just plain embarassing Bridget!  Both characters are disadvantaged, but Elizabeth Bennett's shortcomings are completely external while Bridget Jones's issues are an ingregal part of her personal core. I suppose the point of the story is that if Bridget can find happiness with Darcy, then all of us everygirls have hope.  But for this kind of plot to interest me, it would have to have something that makes sense about his attraction to Bridget.  Elizabeth Bennett was beneath Darcy's social status, but she was a superior woman and you could see why he loved her - she was his equal in temperment, character and intellegence.  The fact that he was able to recognise her worth,and love her is the main thing that made him attractive as a love interest.  We all want to believe that there is something loveable in us, and a man who sees our finer qualities is dream boat!  But I definately didn't swoon over Bridget's Darcy.  She was beneath him in every possible way and I couldn't connect with them as a couple.  In fact, I found it hard to even respect a guy who could fall for someone like Bridget and the idea her as a heroine was a little depressing.  It just wasn't believable and therefore I didn't really care if they got back together or not.<br /><br />I also don't get Renee Zellwegger in the title role.  She is sometimes a decent actress, but I didn't find her believable as a Brit, because her accent and mannerisms seemed off.  Since I am an American, perhaps it was my ear that was off, but the whole thing came across so contrived and overdone that it was distracting.  Also, the weight Renee gained for this role looked unnatural on her, and I kept wishing that the lead character was someone who was truly British and naturally plump.  There are plenty of fat girls who are very beautiful because their faces and bodies are meant to be round and soft.  Rene's natural rock-hard fitness just didn't translate well, and instead of coming off as an ordinary overweight girl, she looked hard, ill, and bloated - It reminded me of the \\"cockroach man\\" in MEN IN BLACK.  Very distasteful.  What in the world would have been so bad about hiring a real, live, pretty, plus sized English actress to play this role?  Was it actually necessary to find a skinny actress and pay her to pack on a bunch of pounds?  I think the message here speaks for itself - \\"fat people are undesirable, so when you need an actress to play a fat role, hire a skinny/fit one and have her gain weight.  After all, everyone knows that fat people cannot act!\\"<br /><br />I guess this movie is OK for what it is, but certainly nothing I would care to watch again.  Now, excuse me while I cleanse my senses with a dose of Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in the real PRIDE AND PREJUDICE!But I definately didn't swoon over Bridget's Darcy.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|The title is a true representation of the relationship between Gideon and Eva. I loved this well written, well told story. The characters' development was so believable.The intrigue was a bonus. I was saddend to find out that part 3 will not be available until May 2013. The story of Gideon and Eva held my interest and seemed more plausible than the Fifty Shades trilogy.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Best John Mayer album so far.  It is (or it seems) very honest.  I think he wrote it from a place of truth and that is good coming from him.  There is not one bad song on the album.  I love Walt Grace.

B008FSCNTK|1.0|I started listening to this record, and got hit with a hammer.  Not only is the material NOT suited to Ms. Krall, I smelled another ruined attempt to smother an artist a la T-Bone head.  Look at the notes, sure enough T-Bone phones in another hatchet job.  Like I said in another review,  the Robert Plant/ Allison Krauss worked, but then he brought the same junk to Gregg Allman, and here it is again as he ruins another primo artist. Disgusting.  Amazon want's 6.99 for it cause they can't move garbage like this at a real price.  My best wishes to Ms. Krall, who needs to follow her own muse and get back to creating for herself.  Sorry the soft porn cover probably isn't moving many units either.

B007KW5N9Y|5.0|`People will do anything for a potato'<br /><br />When I think about the films of Steven Spielberg, \\"Empire of the Sun\\" ranks among my all-time favorites by this director.<br /><br />There's so much to take in here, from the story and acting to the sets and cinematography that \\"Empire of the Sun\\" is also one of my all-time favorite films, period.<br /><br />Set during World War II, the story centers around Jamie, a boy from a well-to-do British family living in Shanghai.  When the movie begins, we witness events in Jamie's idyllic life - he's spoiled and takes advantage of those charged with his care. After hostilities escalate between Japan and China, Jamie becomes separated from his family, and the remainder of the movie deals with the boy's ability to survive on his own in a drastically different environment.<br /><br />You may never quite warm up to Jamie (played perfectly by an adolescent Christian Bale), but you have to admire his ability to adapt. Like him or not, the final scene in \\"Empire of the Sun\\" should bring a tear to your eye.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this movie, you will be blown away by the quality of the Blu Ray transfer!  An incredible amount of fine detail that was missing from the original DVD is revealed in this transfer -I was struck by a scene early in the film where Jamie comes upon a downed fighter plane - you see all the wear and tear the aircraft went through. Color(check out the \\"costume party\\" scene) and contrast and sound are excellent. A must-have!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This book is good little read.  I will admit it was hard for me to get into, because initially, I was reading about something without much explanation.  The author does provide more insight as you read along though.  If you like any fantastical world, you'll probably enjoy this book.

0547884591|5.0|There is no better guide to the art and science of cutting, cooking eating and living then the 4 Hour Chef. I recommend reading it like a reference guide. Pick and choose the chapters that intrigue you the most like \\"the Science of Liquid Nitrogen\\" or \\"Brown Butter Plantains\\". Cooking has never been \\"taught\\" like this before.
0525953728|5.0|This book was a very quick read and very interesting.  I had no prior knowledge about Navy SEALs, specifically what they do and experience and how they live.  This book described the experiences of \\"Mark Owen\\" as part of the Navy SEALs.  It seems like a life devoted to your work, without much fanface, only internal satisfaction at a mission well-done.<br /><br />The section of the book that detailed the raid that brought down OBL was fun to read -- almost like a fiction book, even though it was real.  It was real exciting to read and felt like you were actually there watching it take place.<br /><br />I was talking yesterday to someone at work who said the U.S. actually used OBL's help in the 1980s to fight against Russia.  This was the first time I had heard of that, so I am now wondering how much propaganda has been used in this country and possibly in this book.  Regardless, it was an excellent book to read.  There were a couple spelling errors and grammar problems, but nothing major.
0756656230|5.0|My 9 year old son has read this book (or looked through its pictures) dozens of times.  He has had fun looking at all of the past lego collections and has used some of the photos to inspire his own creations.<br /><br />Many of the featured legos are no longer available for sale which has sometimes been frustrating for him after he sees something he really likes, however some are still for sale or there will be an updated version or you can find (expensive) used versions online.  The featured legos all show the lego set number which makes them easy to look up online.
1451662432|4.0|After reading this book, I can understand why a lot of people don't like Arnold.  He comes off as brash, macho, and a bit arrogant.  But that's exactly what I like about him.  He is who he is and makes no apologies for it.<br /><br />My first real awareness of him came around the time Terminator 2 was released.  I watched the movie on VHS at a friend's sleepover party (I was about 10) and had nightmares for the next few weeks.  Now that I have watched and enjoyed his other movies (T1, Twins, Commando), he is one of my favorite actors.  Reading the book filled in the blanks on the rest of his life -- growing up in Austria, getting into body-building, moving to America, building wealth via real-estate, becoming an actor, starting a family, and running for Governator.  He has lived an active life full of unique experiences and it was very enjoyable to read about his story and get his perspective on his own life.<br /><br />Fun to read and provided a lot of interesting tidbits about him that I didn't know.  It also talks briefly about the housekeeper and son incident.  Nothing saucy, but just a statement of the facts, from his point of view.<br /><br />I'm sure it is difficult to live in the public eye and have people like me talking about him and his wife and family, but that's where we are today as a society.  That's the price of fame, I guess.  Fokker out!
0316078913|2.0|This was a book club selection and the book did have several funny, entertaining moments but it was very shallow, many times painfully slow-moving, mindless and occasionally offensive.  There are countless other books I would rather have rather spent my time on.  If someone gives you this book or you can pick up a free or very cheap, used copy it is a decent time waster (think loud waiting room material) that doesn't require any concentration, otherwise, save your money and buy something more worth your valuable time.

1451695187|5.0|This book was for me \\"Proof of Heaven\\". Just as the author discovered in his medical training, I too, learned in my own medical training, that unless you could prove your hypothesis with a trial or experiment, it isn't valid or significant. I had been raised as a protestant and would pray and observe all my customs within my religion, but I had lots of fears about the existance of an 'afterlife'. I couldn't 'prove' that the afterlife existed and had been searching for more proof in order to overcome my logical, scientific thinking. I had begun to hope that there was an afterlife. I observed that people, close to the end of their lives, reported that they had conversations with departed family members. When I saw that this book was written by a neurosurgeon who'd had a NDE, I was very interested to read it. I pre-ordered it and got it upon it's release.<br />I love this book. Dr Eben's descriptions as to his illness, what it was, what happened to his brain during his coma based upon all of the scientific evidence from his MRIs, Cat scans and lumbar punctures, etc, was quite astonishing to me. I was so enthralled by the mystery of how his comatose state evolved. It was because of that, once I started reading it, I simply read it in one sitting so quickly as page after page flew by. He indeed wrote it as a clinical presentation with pure engaging language that was entertaining even as he made his case for the meaning of his 'near death experiance'. He proved that 'Heaven' is the afterlife of our time spent on Earth, which has the purpose of examination, meaning and most of all, Universal Love. He explained he was chosen for this experience in order to provide the idea of the marriage of Science and Spirit.<br />I highly recommend this book, I felt a tremendous relief to have this \\"Proof of Heaven\\".
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This record is amazing. I highly recommend it. There is not a bad song on this whole CD. Macklemore has amazing flow and lyrics. Ryan Lewis does an amazing job as producer. This CD not only has great rap but an amazing message to go along with it. I would recommend this to anyone, even those who are not fans of rap. This is very accessible to everyone. This is the most complete album that I have heard in a while.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Since \\"The Eminem Show\\", Eminem lost it for me.  I couldn't really stand his music and although he made a few songs that I liked I just didn't even bother with him.  When he released \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" with Rihanna I was prepared to buy the album.  I love Rihanna and that song really did it for me, but I was definitely worried about the album itself so I waited until I could find it cheaper.  Honestly I wish I hadn't, this album is pretty fantastic!  This feels like Eminem is back to himself but with new found wisdom and insight.  Some of my favorite songs are:<br /><br />Talkin' 2 Myself<br />W.T.P<br />Not Afraid<br />Seduction<br />Space Bound<br /><br />I think overall, there is some difference to his older albums.  He doesn't have as much humor but I personally like it.  The serious overtone, but without the insane jealousy and pettiness is really want I wanted from him all alone.  I'm pretty excited to see what he makes next time around.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Execellent! A band with legends, which I would call a real supergroup, the songs are written really good and it just doesn't get any better.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I would have bought The Panther simply because I'm a huge Nelson DeMille fan, but I was very disappointed in this latest release.  It's overly long, and I prefer long books, but it took me over two weeks to read it.  There was very little suspense, but quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, typical of his John Corey character.  I did learn a lot about Yemen, but the information was discouraging.  But my main problem with The Panther, unlike The Lion and The Lion's Den, was that Mr. DeMille never explained why The Panther, a U.S. citizen and schooled in America, chose to return to Yemen and why he disavowed his family in favor of living in a cave.  He also had a female companion but the reader learned nothing about her.  And finally, who was more untrustworthy, the United States Government or the Yemenis?  I won't stop reading his books, but I can't recommend The Panther.

B005LAIIGC|4.0|It seems Holiday films can be seen almost anywhere, but few are as fun and heartfelt as Dreamworks, 'Rise Of The Guardians'. I was attending a Dreamwork's screening and it was director Peter Ramsey (Monster Vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space) who took the book by William Joyce and the wonderful screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire (Oz The Great and Powerful, Robots) and made a really passionate film about the various Holiday Icons and their familiarity with each other and why they are all forced to save the children of the world in one night or two.<br /><br />Leading the cast, and explaining his backstory, is the voice of Chris Pine (Star Trek 2009, Unstoppable) playing the always present but never noticed Jack Frost. The story begins and ends with him learning about who he really is, what he is capable of and what lies in the center of his being that literally saves all the children of the world.  Jack has a very real emotional arch that I think kids are really going to sympathize with and understand why the Man In the Moon chose him as the next Guardian. (Of the children of the world.)<br /><br />Producer Christina Steinberg (Bee Movie, National Treasure) says, \\"Working with the cast was amazing. The time and creativity they put into their characters brought them colorfully to life. Really better than what we expected. These actors transformed themselves into these characters.\\"<br /><br />Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Rock of Ages) is the voice of North (otherwise known as S. Claus) who has the task of convincing not only Jack of his purpose in life and meaning for becoming a Guardian for the children of the world, but he has to convince his fellow teammates that Jack is worthy of the Man In The Moon's choice - to be another Guardian.<br /><br />Ilsa Fisher (Wedding Crashers, Rango) is the voice of Tooth (or the Tooth Fairy) who really needs help from all her fellow Guardians and especially Jack who sees the real meaning of each tooth that the Tooth Fairy takes. She is so warm and friendly and there is an effervescent charm in her and her little fairies that help her.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Le Miserables) plays Bunny (or also known as the East Bunny) who has an accent, an attitude and a real issue with Jack joining their exclusive group. However, by the end of the film - Jack and Bunny end up being truly the very best at what they do.<br /><br />Now add the element of the bad guy, Pitch Black, voiced sinisterly by Jude Law (Sherlock Holms, I.E.) and you have one of the scariest and meanest villains in the realm of animation films. He's mean and hurtful and he and Jack have an amazing showdown at the end that will warm your heart. There is even the character of The Sandman that has no dialogue but speaks through pictures made by piles of sand and he is hysterically funny doing it.<br /><br />Executive Producer and creative consultant Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labrynth, Hellboy) says, \\"I loved what the story was developing into. It was really alive and filled with great visuals. The details from the cast and their passion were amazing to watch. I think kids of all ages will love this film!\\"<br /><br />`Rise of the Guardians' is a real adventurous film with color, style and the most amazing animation which works well both in 2D and even better in 3D. Most importantly it has an excellent story with a real heart at its center and it will make you feel good after seeing it.

B0074PNCRM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I can't recommend it enough. It is sad, but beautifully so, and makes you ask so many bigger questions in life.<br />This was my first introduction to John Green and I have since purchased the other titles in his repertoire, all of which I have also fallen head over heels for. He's a fantastic story teller who is great at raising life questions without being preachy about it - five stars, no question.

B00A14SQBU|5.0|I say this as someone who is not a Christina fan: I bought this album on a whim because I thought the single Your Body was catchy, and I love it. I have been playing it over and over. This is one of those albums that was made to be played LOUD and it's a blast. I have discovered my car's actually got sub-woofers! I suspect Christina Aquillera might be able to sing over top of taiko drums, live.<br /><br />The record is very, very powerful. The Lotus Intro uses imagery more typically associated with the phoenix to declare a fresh start (and let's be serious: she had some personal issues in the last couple years and this album is a major bounce-back).  There's a little autotune sfx in that song's background vocals, but it's just used to create an etheral feeling and doesn't detract. Autotune is not used much elsewhere. Army of Me is a self-empowerment rocker that Kelly Clarkson probably would have liked to record.<br /><br />Once the war is won the party is started with Red Hot Kind of Love, and then Cee-Lo Green drops in for Make the World Move (though his part doesn't stand out too much, it's more of a cameo backing vocal really). Those two songs have what I call a baroque bombastic party feel with drums and horns that make me think of Mardi gras revelry. I guess when you have as big a voice as Christina you have to find material that you don't overpower and these are good examples of that. After that we're up to the single Your Body and then the celebratory Let There Be Love which continues the party vibe.<br /><br />The album shifts downtempo with power ballad Sing for Me and Blank Page. Those are about the only 2 songs on the album that don't leave a strong impression on me, but more standout material quickly eclipse them. The tempo shifts up with a bit of Rihanna-esque dancey funk with Cease Fire and Around the World. Circles picks up a harder, more rock edge with a little autotuning that gives some of the backing vocals an \\"over the loudspeaker\\" quality. The album moves toward a climax with the building Best of Me which extols the virtue of remaining strong. Finally Lotus finishes with a duet with Blake Shelton, Just a Fool. Blake's vocals really stand out and we end up with a classic and very effective \\"he says/she says\\" power duet.<br /><br />Overall, the album is simply amazing. Christina has her signature power vocal style but the material suits her voice and supports her. The style is overall pretty dancey - as in she's going to make you get up and move, not necessarily club style, though there is some of that. There are some great rock influences too. It took a while to move past listening to the first songs over and over and it was great when I found the whole album to be so consistent. Final thought: I should probably have bought the deluxe edition because I want some more of this.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|This game definitely falls into the category of time waster.  There is nothing especially challenging about it, and as the levels go up, it takes longer and longer to complete a level.  I have been playing it for a while, but am probably close to uninstalling it as the repetition is getting kind of boring.  Runs fine on my Galaxy S3, no lag, no crashes, beautiful graphics.  But it is just the same thing over and over.

B005FUTBWS|4.0|It can be a mixed bag when a \\"genre\\" director makes a foray into a category that he/she has never tried before.  For example, no one is stopping Rob Zombie from making a romantic comedy, but one has to wonder what the success of that film would look like.  Heck, I even wonder what the title would look like - The Devil's Roses?  House of 1,000 Delightful Misunderstandings?<br /><br />So in March of this year, it was with great intrigue that I attended an advance screening of Kevin Smith's new film, Red State.  Smith is known to both casual movie-goers and his legions of hard-core fans as the comedic mastermind behind cult classics as Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  But Red State sees Smith take things in a whole new direction, something that can most closely be approximated to the horror genre.  By Smith's own admission, the film isn't exactly a horror flick, but it doesn't really have any other genre to fall into; as he stated during the Q&A session after the Indianapolis filming that I attended, \\"there is no `political-social commentary' genre...there are things that happen in the movie that are horrific, so I decided to call it a horror film.\\"<br /><br />He is most definitely correct: there are quite horrific moments in the story, enough so that I would agree with him in his categorization of the movie.  In Red State, a group of three teenagers begin the story by agreeing to meet up for a group-sex encounter with an older woman whom they found online.  In typical teenage fashion, they don't do much research (or thinking in general), and the scenario turns out to be a trap concocted by a radical, pseudo-religious, cult-like group, fashioned in this story to appear strikingly similar to the Westboro Baptist Church.<br /><br />Things up to this point in the story could pass for a \\"typical Kevin Smith movie,\\" with sex jokes, witty banter, and the like, but things soon take a turn for the seriously-gruesome.  The group's members, led bytheir fanatical pastor Abin Cooper (played by Michael Parks in typically-awesome Parks-ian fashion), have some truly terrible things planned for the boys, and the unintentional intervention of the local bumbling law enforcement leads to a much bigger confrontation: the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms), who have been watching the \\"church\\" for some time, show up in full government force, and the standoff at the church's not-surprisingly-well-fortified compound gets bloody quickly.  People die, political rhetoric is spouted in mass amounts on both sides, and the end takes several intriguing turns before settling on the final word via one of Smith's always-well-worded closing statements.<br /><br />During the post-showing interview session, I asked Smith what he hopes the world will remembers his film's religious message as (even some of his other films, though comedies, also dealt with religious aspects and commentary).  Without missing a beat, he responded confidently with \\"Don't fear God, fear His followers.\\"  Red State certainly embodies that message, and ultimately it's up to the individual viewer if you can agree enough with Smith's opinions to see that message presented effectively in this film.

B009E3EY38|5.0|I bought the 2 CD/BluRay/Bonus DVD version of \\"Celebration Day\\" on Amazon. The concert film was recorded December 10th, 2007 at the 02 Arena in London. It was a very special and rare reunion and they only played this gig.  The first thing that I did was throw on the BluRay.  The sound and picture quality are excellent. Led Zeppelin were THE rock gods of the late 60's and early 70's.  They played a huge part of my youth and I have never grown tired of them.  It's most unfortunate that I never got to see them perform live, except for the Plant/Page tours of 1995 and 1998. The band look like they are sincerely enjoying themselves and they rock it pretty hard.  Jimmy Page is the greatest living guitar player of our time.  He simply is on fire during this performance ! John Paul Jones is right on the money as well.  He is a beast on the bass.  Plant does a great job.  Though I did catch a couple of struggles here and there.  But at 59 years old, I give him credit. He can still belt it out.  Jason Bonham, John Bonham's son does a superb job on drums and holds the band together very well.  All the Great songs are in this set.  \\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\", \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\",  \\"Dazed and Confused\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", \\"No Quarter\\" and of course \\"Celebration Day'.  The rarity \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", Led Zeppelin's biggest hit and one that Robert Plant hated to play live goes over without a hitch. And the shot of the girl in the front crying at the end was a nice touch.  They did one of my favorite Led Zeppelin songs \\"Kashmir\\" from the \\"Physical Graffiti\\" LP.  And that gave me goosebumps and brought a couple of tears to my eyes . For me, I would have loved to have heard \\"Going to California\\", \\"Friends\\", \\"Immigrant Song\\" \\"Hey, Hey What Can I Do?\\", \\"Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\".  But that is a small fragment of a long list. All in all, it's a brilliant, solid 2 hours of live Zeppelin. 16 songs in all. There are also 2 CD's of the exact same set as the BluRay. The 4th disk is a bonus DVD of Led Zeppelin live at rehearsals, recorded December 6th, 2007 at Shepperton Studios, London. This was their final rehearsal before the 02 Arena show.  It is the whole set of songs played in their entirety. The camera is in back of studio, so no close up of the band except for a large video monitor.  The sound on the bonus DVD is stellar. Also included is a nice little booklet with linear notes from all 4 members.  This deluxe version of \\"Celebration Day\\". is for die hard Led Zeppelin fans.  I highly recommend this beautiful packaged set.  I only wish they would release the Led Zeppelin DVD from 2003 on BluRay with the classic vintage material. Especially the \\"Earl's Court' performance from 1975. My only problem with \\"Celebration Day\\" are the cell phones being held up when they are professionally recording for a concert film. I guess I am \\"old school\\".  It is safe to say,  I will enjoy this set for many years to come.

B009R9WAZ8|3.0|Ever since her unfortunate altercation with Chris Brown in 2009, Rihanna has taken that experience to heart. It was very apparent in the heartfelt and dark \\"Rated R\\" released that same year. She was able to mask the pain with her 2010 blockbuster \\"Loud\\", and then she slowly started to slip into a slump with 2011's \\"Talk That Talk\\". Perhaps it was time to change the game, even though releasing yet another album would prove only Rihanna's overly consistent nature. She bares it all on the cover of \\"Unapologetic\\", which suggests that RiRi would be the bold and innovative just as she was in 2007 with \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\". But her mission for improvement seems to be more of a dream with every passing album. As the years go by, Rihanna gets colder, harder, darker, and more distant. The lead single \\"Diamonds\\" is a refreshing exception, for as simple as it is, it's still very addictive. But unlike other pop albums in 2012, the lead single is not the best track on the album. Even though much of \\"Unapologetic\\" does not push the envelope or head in any certain direction, there are still tiny moments where Rihanna shines bright. \\"Lost in Paradise\\" is a perfect example, along with \\"Nobody's Business\\" with Chris Brown, which is no doubt another attempt to justify Rihanna's love for her abuser. All of these tracks are found within the second half of the album, because aside from \\"Diamonds\\", the first half is about as generic as rap-pop gets in 2012. And while \\"Diamonds\\" has simple lyrical content, the rest of the first half has barely any lyrics, just fuzzy beats and simpering voice overlays. Even the appearances of Eminem and Future cannot breathe life into these dreary tunes. But \\"Jump\\" is another exception and the David Guetta produced \\"Right Now\\" shakes things up slightly, only to keep the interest. But while the first half is definitely flawed, the second half is only slightly better. It focuses more on rock/pop and saccharine ballads. Somehow, one always manages to eclipse the other, resulting in a mess of roaring guitars, strained vocals and clumsy beats. Even though the seven minute long \\"Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary\\" lightens the murk, it cannot illuminate it. Perhaps Rihanna would be better off if she just faced her emotions about her and Chris' fight instead of covering them up with this mess of an album. There's no doubt that Rihanna's effort to make music and make it sellable is there, but if she continues to let her own mind get in the way of her music she won't have many hits left.<br /><br />A person can change a lot in seven years. We all know RiRi is not the same 17-year old who fired up the charts with \\"Pon De Replay\\", but her identity crisis has never been so apparent the way it is here. She can't decide whether or not she's fine with her assault, or if she secretly resents it, even when she proclaims her feelings for Chris. Whatever the case, the fact that her music has now started to slip into darkness is even more unfortunate. There's nothing bold or unapologetic about this album.

B00607EWYC|4.0|TINKERS, is amost unusual  read. It is a story of a man's life,and the father at his roots,  remembered from his death bed. The story line is dreamlike contrasted with poetic reflections, almost like fugue states, as the story unfolds. Clocks and a Tinker's life with a story told with some detatchment  about the main characters of the story. It felt like the story teller was on the ceiling and unraveling the tale of his life. Great contrasts in style and character is the most defining thing  I feel about the  writing. Great imagery as well. The writer is very good at  moving through time. I'd like to see it made into a movie...artzy fartzy movie!

B0084IG8TM|3.0|I have read all 3 books and they are awesome. This is a story that sticks with you long after you've finished the book.  I was extremely excited to see the movie. I will say its just ok. However, I liked it well enough to watch the other 2 sequels that are coming. I would say that the movie delivers maybe 85-90% of the book's plot line, and the pacing of the movie is similar to the pacing in the book. I also think the Director did a phenomenal job in translating the people and the scenery to life - it is very much like what i pictured in my head as I read the book.  So I give the Director a thumbs up on that. But I think this a story that requires additional &#34;backstory&#34; to fully appreciate the horrors these people lived thru, both in and outside of the arena. I kept wishing for a little bit of narration from Katniss at key moments, particularly around the death of her father, and how she emerged from that experience a fierce survivor.  Also, Rue was a central and very symbolic character in the book, and her storyline felt rushed in the movie. I was moved by their last scene together, but am not sure I would have been very moved, or understood the significance of the moment, if I hadn't read the book first.  I found myself explaining a lot to my husband, who watched the movie with me but didn't read the books. I think he was lost in parts, and I could understand why.

0316228532|4.0|With the sudden death of Barry Fairbrother, the Parish Council of Pagford is thrown into turmoil. His unexpected passing frees up a position and this vacancy is very much a coveted one.<br /><br />The race for who will get the seat heats up; but the divide between those who were born and bred in Pagford and the rundown 'The Fields' (who due to a boundary mix-up should really fall under Yarvil county council's domain) grows deeper. Gossip and malicious postings on the Council page appear deepening the mistrust and resentment. As the adults cajole and mutter, some of their children individually conspire to teach their parents a lesson or just to retaliate against abuse and lack of knowledge of their own problems.<br /><br />With a tragic end, will the residents of Pagford learn anything as secrets and fears rapidly rise to the service shattering the illusion of a quaint English village.<br /><br />Rowling's outing in to the adult genre is brave and complex. The myriad characters that abound from page to page create a dysfunctional society that even with best interests at heart, they still tear each other apart leaving a wounded town. There is no main individual as such; each person met has their own problems and worries. Whilst none immediately likable, Rowling has still given them depth and huge helpings of realism. It's almost a book of contrasts. The angry teenager who really means well, with the drug addicted mother, the quiet teenager who cuts herself whose mother is the local GP. Black humor abounds as well as some moments of quintessential Britishness. The author is very expressive in both descriptions and dialogue creating a dramatic and inviting picture. She has created a story that is thought-provoking, poignant and perhaps a little bleak, but so worth the read.<br /><br />It took me a little while to get into this book simply because of the number of people met. Once I did, I was completely absorbed by the residents of Pagfords. There were moments of laughing out loud as well as deep sadness. I feel Rowling's new novel is such a markedly big step away from her previous books, people may feel uncomfortable or puzzled - it contains swearing, drug abuse, cutting, sex, politics - but it's these subject matters that make it a compelling read. A bold move which some say hasn't paid off, but I couldn't disagree more. An almost rambling account, Rowling's The Causal Vacancy is a rich portrayal of everyday life, which unfortunately isn't always home baked apple pies or sunny days.

B0002234LS|2.0|I'm not giving anything away by saying the 2004 film \\"Secret Window\\" has a twist ending. From the opening scenes, with steadfast determination, you know there's going to be a twist ending. There will be no spoilers in this review, suffice to say if you cannot anticipate a twist, you haven't been watching films long. Based on the prolific American institution of a Stephen King story, \\"Secret Window\\" has interesting ideas. While I have no knowledge of King's inspiration, I suspect every successful writer has a nut on the doorstep claiming their story was stolen.<br /><br />That's exactly what happens in \\"Secret Window.\\" In a nice turn, Johnny Depp plays successful mystery writer Morton Rainey, presently immersed in slothful depression. His wife left him and he spends his days in a remote cabin adorned in a bathrobe. He's working on a book, though appears to be suffering from writer's block. He's unshaven, in need of a haircut and painfully relives the moment he caught his wife in bed with another man. There's a knock at the door and standing before him is John Turturro with a Mississippi accent. If that combination is not terrifying enough, Turturro menacingly states, \\"Ya stole ma story.\\" I love Turturro and think he's one of the finest character actors working today. A New York talent at home in urban roles, his casting as a Bill McKinney hick is the film's first misstep. Perhaps filmmakers were hoping to capture the Preacher Harry Powell vibe of [[ASIN:B000035P5R The Night of the Hunter]], but never for a moment did I believe Turturro's Johnny Shooter was plausible.<br /><br />Shooter begins stalking the reclusive writer, terrorizing his pet and following him to his wife's house in the city. Rainey's wife Amy is played by the lovely Maria Bello, who's now residing in their former home with the new boyfriend (Timothy Hutton) hovering around with great irritation. She's impatiently awaiting Rainey to sign the divorce papers, which he's too busy to do because, well, he's working on that new story. Rainey's more concerned with finding an old issue of a magazine to disprove Shooter's persistent claims of plagiarism. Shooter, usually stepping from behind a tree, sets a deadline for Rainey to find the magazine or he's going to ruin his life.<br /><br />David Koepp directed this film, a good screenplay writer who penned  [[ASIN:B000JCMYG2 Panic Room]]. He also wrote and directed the interesting [[ASIN:B00000IQW8 The Trigger Effect]]. Both credits reveal the issues I have with his work. \\"Panic Room\\" was directed by David Fincher and it's arguably one of his weakest films. But Fincher's gloomy eye, the most talented of his generation, raises the story's so-so level into an unusually atmospheric chiller. \\"The Trigger Effect,\\" involving an unexplained blackout, completely collapses during its final third as desperate protagonists head for the California hills of white sunshine, with a uniquely sinister atmosphere lost in the rear view mirror. I'm not sure Koepp has the right instinct for such darkness, as his films scream for a demented Hitchcock/Polanski auteur with forlorn demeanor ([[ASIN:B000ICXQXI Psycho (1960)]], [[ASIN:B004CP2566 Repulsion]]). There's barely an inspired shadow in \\"Secret Window,\\" with the cheery look of a Palmolive TV commercial.<br /><br />Depp's jittery performance also has a comedic edge, inconsistent with the increasingly bleak momentum. To his credit, he does some earnest work as Rainey in what amounts to the only substantial role in the film. Most importantly, if a film is going to have the aforementioned twist, you better fool the viewer until the final curtain. Perhaps the greatest twist in cinematic history was M. Night Shyamalan's [[ASIN:B00004BZIY The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)]], a brilliant perfect-storm maelstrom of Rod Serling-esque atmosphere. Never for a moment does \\"Secret Window\\" come close to such devilry and, let's be frank, was the twist not so predictable as to be apparent halfway in?

Just let me suggest you watch this film and appreciate its quality.<br /><br />I hope people who like John Carter will read the other Edgar Rice Burroughs books as well as some of the classic adventure stories that came out of the late Victorian era.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay is the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy.  It is now time for District 13 to really make themselves known to the world and to the Capitol.  With the help of their mockingjay (Katniss), the people of District 13 intend to take down the Capitol and change the world as they know it.  Gale is also there to help with the uprising alongside Katniss, but Peeta is not able to help for reasons that will become clear when you read the book.  You will absolutely hate the Capitol more than ever in this book, but will you like District 13 any better?  It begins to become clear that the government and president of District 13 might not be much better than that of the Capitol.  The book is filled with action, shocking twists and turns, and will make you want to kill the Capitol yourself!<br /><br />I gave Mockingjay a rating of 6.5 because I was, surprisingly, very disappointed with it.  I absolutely LOVED the first two books of this trilogy, but this one was extremely disappointing.  In the previous books, Katniss was always right in the middle of the action and kicking butt.  But, in this book, it seemed as though Katniss was always messed up and in the hospital instead of helping the battle towards the Capitol.  She is involved in some action, of course, but not at the more important times.  Collins also did not show some of the action that the reader is anticipating, such as the rescue of Peeta or a lot of the actual destruction of the Capitol.<br /><br />I was also EXTREMELY disappointed with the ending.  What is the point in reading two fantastic books and then ending the third one in such a disappointing fashion?  In my opinion, the last book should be the best book, otherwise you are just left with an incomplete, depressing feeling...or is that just me?  The ending of this book felt very rushed.  It did not seem complete.  It did not describe as much as it should have in order to give a complete feeling.  I'm not sure what was happening with Collins during this ending, since she has demonstrated her wonderful writing skills in the first two books.  Maybe it was the pressure of a deadline.  Maybe because the first two were so successful, she felt the need to rush through this one to satisfy fans?  However, rushing through the writing will not satisfy fans!!!<br /><br />I still suggest that you read the trilogy, as the first two are well worth reading.  Just don't get your hopes up for a thrilling, satisfying completion.this ending, since she has demonstrated her wonderful writing skills in the first two books.

B000002HD5|5.0|Back in the early to mid 90s, when there were still things such as music stores - even ones who sold used music and CDs, my friend (who managed such a store) played this as the in-store music.  A particular song provoked me to ask who it was.  After visiting with him, I left the store with this album (CD) in hand.  I have loved it fiercely ever since.  Only about 21 or 22 at the time, the music and lyrics really connected with me.  I place this album as my all-time favorite work of the entire 1990s.  As a music lover of multiple genres, this is high praise.  If you liked rock, grunge, alternative, this timeless music on this album will still be relevant and interesting to you.<br />I love every note.  So could you.
1442419814|4.0|I was really excited to read this book, due to all the hype surrounding it.  I thought, finally, another book that will grab my attention and threaten to not ever let go until the words stop!  However, I was disappointed.  It's not that the novel isn't good; it is good, it's just not great.  Certainly not as great as one would expect when there is so much hype.<br /><br />The story is definitely unique and creative.  I applaud Westerfeld for coming up with this unique dystopian world where everyone is ugly until they turn 16, at which point they turn pretty and enter a world where everyone else is pretty too.  The point of making everyone basically look the same to to try to create a world without war or bullying - a world where everyone gets along and everyone is happy.  But, is it really better this way?  Turns out, there are some things you can't change and there are some people who will still disagree and fight against the system.  Though I do like the uniqueness of this world that Westerfeld created, I feel as though he should have went into more detail at the beginning.  I found myself questioning things and not really knowing much about the cities and how these people live until later on.  The reader will have to put the pieces together while reading in order to figure everything out about this world.<br /><br />The characters...hmm...the characters are okay.  I didn't feel as though Westerfeld created the main character, Tally, as well as he could have.  I didn't really become all that attached to her throughout the story.  Maybe a little more during the end of the novel, but I wasn't as attached to her as I like to be with main characters.  I can't quite put my finger on just what the problem was with these characters.  They were developed pretty well throughout the story and they were likeable, but something prevented me from fully connecting with them.<br /><br />The writing is pretty good.  Good quality of writing and it makes sure to catch your interest.  Again, something was missing that was preventing me from really being captivated by the book.  But it was good enough.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to fans of YA dystopian fiction.  I wouldn't highly recommend it, but I feel it's worthy of a read if you are looking for something creative and unique.  One thing that bothered me was the city names.  I think that Westerfeld could have come up with some better names than \\"Pretty Town\\" and \\"Uglyville\\".  They seem like childish names and are not very creative.  But these are not big problems at all, just something that bugged me.<br /><br />You can read more of my reviews on my blog: SIK Book Reviews.

B003A4IFGY|1.0|I love Petty enough to drive 4 hours to see him on tour.  I consider him one of our greatest artists of our time.  This album was a total disappointment.  While I consider Petty one the masters at crafting songs with hook that have you singing them long after the radio is turned off, this release lacked a single one that met that standard.  This album seemed to be an experiment into new territory; the lab results are in and it's not good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to read The Hunger Games for obvious reasons...because everyone else was doing it, of course!  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but to my surprise I fell in love.  I love love love this book.  Yes, it's a young adult book and, yes, I am an adult.  But I don't care!  The novel is written maturely and in a way which any reader of any age can (and will) enjoy it.  Although Collins clearly intended  the book for young adult/teenage audiences, it is very enjoyable for any age and any gender.  My fianc&eacute; (male) loved it, my mother (late 50s) loved it, my sister (mid-30s) loved it, and I loved it!<br /><br />The novel is narrated by a 16-year-old girl named Katniss.  Although she is only 16, Katniss is mature beyond her years.  This maturity is a result of her father's death and her mother's inability to cope with the loss of her husband.  Katniss, therefore, has no choice but to take on the motherly role in the household and take care of her mother, her younger sister Prim, and herself.  Due to this role, Katniss becomes very protective of her sister, even so much so that Prim does not get the chance to mature as much as maybe she should in this distopian world.  The children need to be prepared for the possibility of their name being drawn once every year, in which they begin the journey of the Hunger Games.  The Games were created by the powerful Capitol as a reminder not to create an uprising and to just follow orders from the Capitol.  In the Games, there is only one survivor out of 24 kids aged 11-18!  Turns out that Prim is chosen this year, but Katniss (holy crap!) steps in as her replacement.  The reader is then taken through the terrifying journey of Katniss to and inside the Games.<br /><br />The novel is very creative and takes the reader on a journey through many emotions, including fear, depression, anxiety, happiness, hope, and anger.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the characters throughout the story.  Katniss...oh, how I adore you!  I admire this 16-year-old character for so many reasons.  She is very courageous and so strong throughout all the horrible things she must go through in her journey.  Peeta, of course, is endearing.  Peeta is a 16-year-old boy who has also had his name drawn to compete in the Hunger Games this year.  We discover that this boy is going to be challenging for Katniss to bring herself to eventually kill (if she is to survive) because he pretty much saved her life when they were younger.  And Gale (an 18-year-old boy who is best friends with Katniss) is Katniss's rock, and how can you not love a rock?  The love triangle, however, is a bit clich&eacute; for my liking.<br /><br />I still have reservations about the fact that 13-year-old kids are reading this book in school.  Kids reading about kids killing kids...strange...<br /><br />Another element that I found interesting and pretty dead-on was Collins's underlying comments (or, at least, what I think she was commenting) on today's society.  In today's popular culture, so many of us are enveloped in watching reality television shows of all different types and genres.  So, if there was really a hunger games in real life, would people watch it and cheer for and sponsor certain tributes while others are dying?  I think Collins is saying that we would, or at least that it's a possibility.<br /><br />Enough babbling about this fantastic book.  I recommend that anyone and everyone should READ THIS BOOK!  I promise, you will not want to put it down once you pick it up!  It is so wonderfully intense.his 16-year-old character for so many reasons.

1616614609|5.0|I've been over a couple of games with Netrunner, and I have to say: it far exceeds my expectations, which were quite high due to the positive reviews I have read about this game.<br /><br />The cyberpunk theme is excellent, and the quality is the usual FFG. What really shines here, however, is the gameplay. Netrunner is tremendously fun to play. With its non-symmetrical gameplay, meaning that the two sides facing each other use different card and different rules, makes this game unique. It also relies on luck much less than other collectible card games thanks to the excellent action-point (click) system. Lastly, because of the LCG format, it doesn't cost you a fortune to build a competitive deck. As a result, in Netrunner, usually the better player wins, not the one with the luckier hand and/or the more expensive cards, as in other card games.<br /><br />We have to see how this game performs on the long run, but as of now, it is one of the best card games in the market. So, if you like card games, or the cyberpunk theme, go ahead and BUY IT! You will not regret it.
0439023491|5.0|Just like the first one (The Hunger Games), I love this book.  I love this series!  The writing is equally intriguing and captivating as the first.  I seriously had issues putting the book down!  But, when my eyes got too tired to read any longer and I decided to finally go to bed, guess what happened?  I freakin' dreamed about the story in Catching Fire and what might happen next!  How crazy is that?  That just goes to show how into the book I really was.<br /><br />If you have read The Hunger Games, you know that Katniss and Peeta were able to trick the Capitol into letting them both survive!  (Yay!)  This causes the president of the Capitol (President Snow) to become angry at the nerve of the two \\"victors\\" for defying the Capitol in this way.  But they are victors, so what can he really do to them without pissing off the entire society?  Well, turns out there is a surprise in store for the next Hunger Games event.  It is the 75th anniversary of the Games, which marks some sort of difference than the normal annual Games.  Every 25 years, there is a change of events for the Games.  No one knows what the change will be until it is announced right before.  What will it be this year?  Read and you shall see!<br /><br />The character of Katniss is still the same strong, determined, badass teenager as she was in the first book.  I love how defiant she is (or tries to be) of authority figures and the Capitol.  There is something endearing about the way she independently acts before thinking.  And Peeta, oh Peeta, still so sweet and protective of Katniss.  Gale has more of a presence in this book too, which is pretty awesome.<br /><br />I absolutely love the creativity that Collins went into for the arena in this book.  I would very much like to discuss the arena further, but oh the spoilers!  Collins's creativity really shines in this arena though.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth reading!  You won't be disappointed.  Lots of intense moments, confusion, shocking twists, a teenage girl kickin' butt, and of course the love story.twists, a teenage girl kickin' butt, and of course the love story.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|There was a time in the early 2000s that a slew of comic book adaptations were made. Catwoman, Steel, DareDevil and countless others were released that gave superhero movies a bad name. Then Christopher Nolan made Batman Begins and it showed the world what a quality adaptation should be. Back to basics, stripping out the fluff from the mythology, and making it all about one tormented man and his desire to protect the vulnerable from the worst examples of a city's most evil. As the title suggest the first half of the movie is Batman's origin story. This is a movie that has Batman grounded in the real world. No quips, no funny lines. Just a man on a mission. Brilliant.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Great service and good quality product.  I ordered it on a whim for my granddaughter and she loved it.  I would recommend it to a friend and anyone who loves musicals.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Much has been said about the content of this wonderful set. I'm going to address the sound. Seems like I've been a lover of the music for half a century, but there has always been something just lacking a bit with the recording quality of it all.  Finally here is some satisfaction that I can get.  The discs are about as satisfying for audiophile sound quality as I could ask.  For the first time I can tell just what every instrument in the band is doing.  The voices are much better defined than I've previously heard and one can hear sounds that a half century of listening has not turned up before.<br />If you love the music and have a playback system of quality, this is the best you'll ever hear The Stones in recordings, I'm sure.  Not to be missed by fans of this music and of quality sound reproduction.
B009X01C64|5.0|This MARWARE REVOLVE CASE for the 8.9\\" Kindle Fire HD has a hard interior frame that grips the tablet securely--once you click the tablet in, it won't be falling out again by accident!  (But if you need to remove the tablet from the case, it comes out fairly easily.)<br /><br />The genuine leather cover is smooth (with some visible but attractive grain) and is lightly padded.  A narrow elastic band holds the cover closed as needed.  This case should provide good protection if your tablet is carried in a bag or tote with other items, is lightly jolted, or is dropped for only a few inches.  (I don't think that anything will protect a large tablet from damage if it is truly dropped.)<br /><br />The case has a built-in stand that solidly supports the 8.9\\" Kindle Fire at three different viewing angles, in either portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal) orientation.  An interior frame rotates to change the orientation, but it takes two hands and a bit of effort to change from landscape to portrait, or back.  (The same is true of other \\"rotational\\" tablet cases that I've looked at.)<br /><br />A tab on the interior frame fits solidly into one of the three deep slots in the cover to  change the viewing angle.  The frame holds the viewing angle firmly without easily allowing the tablet to fall flat.  However, the viewing angles are rather steep, so that only the third slot provides a comfortable viewing angle for me in either portrait or landscape orientation.  (I mostly use my tablet on a tabletop, with a stylus, so need a fairly shallow viewing angle.)<br /><br />An automatic wake/sleep feature turns the big tablet on or off when you open or close the cover.  (When the tablet turns on, you must swipe the \\"unlock\\" ribbon, or the tablet will turn off again.)  This wake/sleep feature works with both landscape orientations (with the camera on the left or on the right), which is important if you frequently rotate the tablet from portrait to landscape and back.<br /><br />The wide elastic band inside the front cover had me baffled--until I read the product description to find it what it is for.  However, this \\"hand strap\\" does in fact work very well for holding your weighty tablet in portrait position for reading if you don't have a flat surface available for the stand.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent high-quality case.  It's expensive, but if you want the rotational feature and/or a padded leather cover (both features add some bulk), it's a good choice.  Another very nice, less expensive case that I like a little better because it has a wider selection of shallower viewing angles, is the [[ASIN:B009X0167Y Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\", Black]].he wide elastic band inside the front cover had me baffled--until I read the product description to find it what it is for.

I remember my teacher reading this book to me, and eventually GAVE me the book when I &#34;graduated&#34; from preschool. Through many things that have happened in my life, I lost this precious book until recently when I purchased it this last week. I want to share this amazing and wonderful classic to my future child (and children) and teach them that the love I have for them is from the beginning and has no end. Regardless of how much they frustrate me. :) Thank you Robert Munsch for creating such an incredible book and bringing back the very few sweet memories I had as a child.

B0083EW97W|5.0|I really like this album.  I'm a big fan of John Mayer (the musician, not the person.  That's another story).  His style of music is very, very unique in the music industry.  He's a brilliant lyricist and a very talented guitarist.  That being said, this album is a bit of a departure from his normal style of music.  He works a country feel into the album.  As a fan of country, I definitely enjoy it.  However, I don't think you need to enjoy country to enjoy this album.  He retains the great lyrics and intriguing music, but this album sounds a little more mature than his previous offerings.  If the lyrics are any reflection of his real life, it sounds like he's matured and hit a point of enlightenment in his life.  I love the inspiring words.<br /><br />In conclusion, I don't know if I can put a genre on John Mayer, especially after offering up this gem.  Whatever it is, I like it.  I like it a lot.

I assumed that the companies that I am interviewing are full of smart people, and jumped to conclusion that the interview is going to be all about brain teasers and dynamic programming. The result was hours of time spent on studying the topics the interviewers never asked. I believe the strength of this book comes from not only the great examples and questions, but also detailed outline of what not to study.

This movie is full of teachings I will try to incorporate into my work and try to pass along to my children. Very entertaining and I would recommend it to anybody.
0316017930|4.0|I haven't read any of Gladwell's other books so I'll be writing this review without any prior knowledge of his previous works. Many people I know have talked about this book and how it changed the way they think about a lot of things, so I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is the exploration of outliers, a term used to describe something or someone that lies outside of a general group. The outliers presented in the book, whether it be an individual person or an entire culture, have all set themselves apart from similar people or ideas. The first part of the book presents multiple examples of people who are successful, mostly thanks to extremely lucky opportunities or situations that were presented to them. These opportunities and situations then led to an advantage that ultimately gave the person the upper hand in almost every way. The second part of the book talks a lot about differences in culture and was a lot more exciting, at least for me, to read. The topic of power distance is thoroughly explored and Gladwell gives great examples of why PD is such an important trait.<br /><br />I realize this review is very vague but it's best to read the book for yourself and discover the stories Gladwell presents. He is a very good writer and knows how to engage the reader in topics that would otherwise be a dreary read. I wouldn't say the book has changed my life, as a lot of other people have said, but it definitely gave me a lot to think about, especially in my professional career. It was helpful for me to look at successful icons and how they got to where they are. I would say the final moral of the story is to look for and seize any opportunities you have. You never know if it will be the one that changes your life.
0761158820|5.0|This is probably our 4th round of this book! Kids will LOVE it! My son spent hours making the monsters and has a collection in his room. I also taught camp this Summer, and the campers loved making the monsters. I bought extra copies to give as gifts and keep on hand for playdates. My son and his friends can become obsessed with making them! There are even blank templates in the back to color and create your own monsters!<br /><br />From a design perspective, the monsters are unique, colorful, quirky, and fairly simple to put together. I am a graphic artist and really appreciated the creative thought put into the personalities and design of each monster. Genius!

As it has been said this is not a book about how to cook, but about how to learn, cooking is just the vehicle he uses to teach.
B00A8D1RA6|4.0|When the season first started, it looked like the writers were trying to see if they could spoon feed us the same old episodes over and over again... I think they found out that they can't get away with it. Raj was being emo about not having a girl in his life, Leonard and Penny were having relationship problems, and she didn't know how she felt about him. Basically, it was all 5 previous season put into the first three episodes of season 6. But once Howard landed onto earth, the show got back on track, and the writers decided not to ruin the show the way Friends was ruined. They figured out, \\"Hey... Wait a second, geeks, nerds, and dorks watch this show... They don't want all this dumb romance crap in the show!\\" Leonard and Penny's relationship became funny again, and they aren't shoving it in our faces. Sheldon and Amy's relationship... Well, it's one of the joys watching those two characters have a relationship together.<br /><br />Best of all, no Leslie Winkle in this season at all. One of the worst characters in season 1 and 2. I couldn't stand her.

Quite a feat! It helps that his light was formerly hidden under the bushel of a host of high voltage personalities like Miles. Taken out of his usual milieu, Ivan shines quietly on his own and in the eyes of his lady-love.<br /><br />I downloaded this one from the Baen site; it grabbed me early in the evening and wouldn't let go until I finished it in one read.<br /><br />The author is known for here excellent plot twists, realistic character building. Her sense of dialogue is sharp and enjoyable because it rings true. In some of her books such as this one and A Civil Campaign, her humor simply cuts loose and the mayhem is laugh out loud funny and mind boggling as any of her other plot twists. Her sense of conflict at the personal, familial or interstellar level is keen and riveting. I would read her novel if it centered on playground rivalry between a group of toddlers. In the back of my mind, I am somewhat braced for this because almost all of her protagonists are busy raising said toddlers.<br /><br />Her novels seem to be lightweight entertainment but if you pay attention, you'll find life truths thoughtfully tucked away.<br /><br />What can I say except &#34;I'd like some more, please&#34;<br /><br />[I have to totally recommend buying Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan series from the Baen website - the Baen versions are DRM-free and Kindle compatible. You are allowed to send your friends and family copies for free-just don't go wild. The Amazon versions are locked.]<br /><br />*Thank you Jim Baen*
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Amazing rendition of all my fav songs wth other greats. all's well with the last recorded songs of RO th great
B008AK8FHM|5.0|One of the few books I could not put down.  Read in a matter of days.  Very well written and incredibly interesting.  Highly recommend!!!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The book is very about a very current and serious problem for our country. We learn a good deal, and it is also hilarious. A terrific read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I began reading this book, that so many people talked about. I questioned myself as too why I was reading it. I became very<br />intrigued with what would happen next, and now I am on book 2, within one week. The only negative thing I will say is that their is alot of X rated events that occur in this book, although it is a love story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books!!! I couldn't put it down. Now I can not wait to read the next two!!!
0547366205|2.0|I bought three copies of the padded board books of TEN LITTLE FINGERS ...  The book was indicated as \\"New\\" Sold by: Turnpike Liquidators on the Amazon site.  The three copies arrived.  All with heavy black felt pen mark on the book edge.  Turnpike did not indicate that the book was black marked on its advertisement.  I would not have bought them if the condition was accurately described. http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0547366205/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new
B008O9V4C2|5.0|The new Donald Fagen album is here and we have nine reasons to be glad. The tasty Fagen riffs begin with the whimsical tale of his romancing a youngster causing passersby to admonish him to \\"hold on to that Slinky Thing\\". \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" finds him trying to convince himself he's OK without a lost lover.  \\"Memorabilia\\" displays his refined musical structure and usual obscure lyrics [in the back of Louis Dakine's backroom] and features a cookin' Michael Leonhart trumpet solo. \\"The Weather in My Head\\" is straight ahead BB King blues with Jon Herington on hand for the guitar licks. As in The Nightfly we have one cover:  Isaac Hayes' \\"Out of The Ghetto\\" - quite delicious. Four other tracks fill in the menu, each with its own reason to savor, though perhaps we learn the origin of \\"Tomorrow's Girls\\" [from Kamakiriad] - \\"Planet D'Rhonda\\" - a place where I really wouldn't want to live, though a short visit could be fun. Nine tracks, some familiar recipes cooked up with a few fresh ingredients delivering a tasty meal for legions of Dan fans.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great read. Highly recommend for everyone. Going to read the other 2 books now, hope as good as this one.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Listening to this cd, I found it not bad to listen to, but no real \\"signature sound\\".  I was hearing Damn Yankees for a while, and other bands.  It seemed derivative to me.  Again, fairly enjoyable, but a bit cliched.  I will offer the disclaimer that the Ace and Peter make up is just wrong.  Kiss has the right to do it, but it is slimy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app -- great way to pass the time especially on a plane during severe turbulence. It is so addictive. Even my five year old is hooked.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Surprised it was published. I've read them all. Why do you increase the number of words required as I type . i've said it all.
141659521X|4.0|Once again, Vince Flynn has written another fantastic story that provides all the action packed sequences his followers have grown to love. Flynn begins the story and immediately the reader is totally engrossed in the mayhem. Some may say that &#34;if your read one Mitch Rapp book, you've read them all,&#34; but this is not quite accurate. This story primarily deals with the Af/Pak region, and we are thrown a couple of curveballs with his new female associate and also his severe concussion.<br /><br />I think that Flynn would benefit from maybe taking Rapp to Africa or Southeast Asia in his next story, as there is a large terrorism footprint there.<br /><br />Looking forward to his next book next Fall...
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|For me, this was surprising look at the awful experiences had by orphaned children in a Catholic instiution that I  would have thought was there to protect and serve their tender needs.  Thank goodness for the fun and engaging story that was beautifully woven throughout.
B009VB97EY|5.0|This movie is awesome. I personally gave it 5 stars because the dancing in it is amazing. The story line is ok and easy to follow. A perfect movie for any Channing Tatum lover!
B008458O3S|5.0|I love simple yet challenging puzzle games. This one did not disappoint. So simple yet can get very complicated towards the end.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|You will not leave your seat once you begin the first of the series. By far the best series to come around in a long time.
034580404X|5.0|i had my sisters books, after i read them i bought my own so i could reread them this winter
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|It was as awesome as the first season.....cant wait for season three! A real must for all us 'Walker' believers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOW!  This is the first time I've ever written a review, or felt that a book was deserving of taking the time to write one.  And I've read a LOT of books.  Anyone who gives this book less than 5 stars is out of their minds!  Fantastic storyline, relatable characters, keeps you reading nonstop...  It took me all of a half second after finishing this to purchase the prequels, First/Second Shift.  I'm pretty much speechless because I can't accurately describe my love for this series; I will leave the words to Hugh Howey who is amazing with them!  Just buy it!
B001R10BEG|5.0|I showed this movie to my 8 and 13 year old girls and they loved it as much as I did.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is very fun. It is hard because once you get far in the game it is hard to get points to unlock games.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this store! The acting is great the story line is amazing and the cat is great! This is a must watch show
B000NTPDSW|5.0|My only issue is with the booklet that comes with it won't fit within the box set itself. The picture is great, and I love how nice it looks on my HDTV! Totally a great set for any Godfather fan!
B007TK77QE|2.0|Casual vacancy.Very dissapointed with this book. so many different people in it it really chops and changes too much for me
B004J3QACQ|5.0|I purchased this primarily to get \\"Johnny Otis Live at Monterrey\\" which is no longer in print and is currently going for ridiculous prices. To me the rest of this set was gravy. It's not strictly \\"blues\\" but has a great variety of artists in the blues and R&B fields. Several of the albums are remastered versions with additional tracks and the mini album covers are sturdier than some other import CDs I've purchased. There simply is nothing to complain about with this much music costing less than $1.50 per CD when purchased from one of the Amazon Marketplace vendors.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Very deep and at some point you have to put it down before it does your head in.Journey of souls is a book not for everyone to read
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|her best cd so far....I love,love,love<br />the songs!!Ms.Boyle has an awesome voice and paired with Donnie ...well I could just listen to this music over and over again.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Book one left me wanting to beat Christian to a pulp, book two left me feeling like he was just another insecure man. In book three he almost makes you love him. He is still insecure and controlling, but shows a side that makes you feel he is after all one in a million. The author rushes the end of the book, it would have been better for her to go slow and write a forth book rather than the way she closed it off.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|is this a review of the packaging and quality of the footage, or of the show?  I think in either case, they're both good enough.
B00846REIS|4.0|I was told to read these books that they were better than \\"50 Shades\\". In all honesty there are some simularities, however the characters are as different as night and day. I didn't fall in love with these characters as I did in \\"50 Shades\\". There is nothing to really pull you in and suck the life out of you. While the books are amusing and easy to read, I wasn't dying to pick up the next book in the series to read on.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow!  Twists and turns all throughout the book.  Loved that I thought I had it figured out and then it turned once again!  Attention grabber for sure!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|When I first started this game I really enjoyed playing.  But the further I got with the levels. the more frustrated I got with the need and the difficulty in getting acorns without spending money.  I want to play for enjoyment. If I wanted to waste money I would go to the Casino.  this game should be able to be played without the frustration of either not getting any further unless you spend money.  what is the use of a &quot;game&quot; that costs money.
0307474259|5.0|Gary Taubes really gets you thinking in this book! I've never looked at carbohydrates the same way again. I'm sure plenty of other reviews have gone into detail of the actual contents of the book, so I'll just skip over that. This book is scientific, but not overly technical. I sat down and read this book over two evenings, I just couldn't put it down! Gave it to my mom and she thought it was very thought-provoking as well. Bottom line, check it out, it's an excellent read! You'll never look at carbs the same way again!
1432794426|5.0|As a loyal Michael Jackson fan for over 40 years, I have come across many negative and exploitative \\"tabloid type\\" books, and very few that are positive and true to the Man Michael was.  After reading Dr. Karen Moriarty's book \\"Defending A King - His life & Legacy\\" I thoroughly recommend it to fans and non-fans alike.  This book offers a refreshing portrayal of Michael as a doting dad, an extraordinary entertainer, and a caring and loving human being. I would like to thank Dr. Moriarty for the love, commitment, and respect she conveys toward Michael in her book.<br />MJlove
B009NPKTN6|3.0|It was entertaining but so 1980's. I am not a Tom fan but he did a good job. It was not worth the rental fee
0374203032|2.0|I would expect better from a philosopher.  The stories are food for thought about what principles can guide societies in deciding what can and cannot be traded for money, but the thought here, such as it is, is very disappointing.
B0035LJZ1Q|3.0|The movie was exciting but the soundtrack was so loud one could barely hear the dialog. The more I turned it up to hear what was being said....of course you know the end of that sentence. I must say I was dissapointed.
B009VYAVTG|5.0|Watched the entire season over two weeks.  Sad that it's over already.  Now we have to wait another year for season 5 to be out on DVD in the U.S.  : (
B007704HO6|5.0|I love the book, I love animals so this was right up my alley - I only wish Kindle books were more reasonable. If they were I would order more.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|I can not explain why there are so many negative reviews of the DTS HD portion of this package. Possible explanations may include the listner not giving his ears enough time to adjust to the new mix. It is also possible that their equipment isn't set up properly or their settings are wrong. My Blu-ray player is connected straight into my Pioneer receiver so it is the receiver decoding the sound. If your player is going through your HD TV and you are then taking the audio from the television and sending it through your audio equipment, you may not be hearing what was intended here. Also, even if you are set up correctly and you select DTS HD sound from the audio options on your screen, make sure your audio receiver isn't set on Dolpy Pro-logic or some other artificial surround setting.<br /><br />My review is coming folks, but first I have to tell you that I am an audiofile. I was still tweaking my settings on my Pioneer receiver 1 year after hooking it up. It takes alot of trial and error to get the settings right. My sub-woofer is older than the receiver, so I had to fool around with many different frequency settings available on my Pioneer. I have a feeling that these negative reviews are coming from people who expected their equipment to sound perfect out of the box, and never took the time to set it up correctly. One reviewer even mentioned that he hit his 5.1 button and heard no difference!<br /><br />Keep in mind that a 5.1 (or greater) mix is NOT going to sound like your old-school 2.0 CD or vinyl record. When bands remaster an album for 2.0, the goal is to bring the analog sound of an old recording up to digital standards while STAYING TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL MIX! On the other hand, when a band re-mixes (Remixing means something entirely different than remastering) a recording, the listener should expect to hear something completely different. With 5 or more channels available to use, particular sounds will now be heard coming from different directions then what was originally intended for the 2.0 mix.<br /><br />My review: What we have here is an unbelievable re-mix of Moving Pictures. I have a 5.1 setup, so I am not sure exactly how many different channels are available in this mix, but the sounds that are coming from my 5 speakers plus sub are incredible! I am completely happy with the work that was done on the music contained here. Each instrument and vocal is now so unbelievably clear it boggles the mind and the senses. The music fills the room. The surround effects were not over-used, but used smartly. If you are used to the 2-channel mix, give your ears time to adjust! BUY IT!<br /><br />Recommendations: Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here Immersion Boxes have Blu-ray audio mixes that are absolutly stunning. I also recommend Queen's A Night at the Opera which I have on DVD Audio.t was originally intended for the 2.0 mix.<br /><br />My review: What we have here is an unbelievable re-mix of Moving Pictures.

B0086DBE62|5.0|This was a great twist on Snow White. Great acting, great costumes - I am often tempted to rent it again
B002361MLA|1.0|Tolle is deeply routed in the phantasy that there can be peace and good free from all of those 'bad' things.  This extends to being free from power dynamics and the like.  This is a little juvenile.<br /><br />There are good and bad things in Tolle's world.  The ego vs. the self, clock time vs psychological time and so forth.  More sophisticated authors move beyond this immature lens of the world.<br /><br />Underneath all his failings, he hits a kernel of truth supported by authors such as Joseph Campbell, Jung, or Arnold Mindell.  Read them rather.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona has always been one of my favorite.<br />The character design, game story, philosophy of the game world, monster system, music, whatever, all appeals to me and those who have an unfathomably deep love for games of this genre.<br />Anyway, it also bring about memories of high school, where academics is so easy compared to college and relationship between students were generally pure. And that's also the significant time where you might have some unrealistic big dream, you have your first lover, whatever.<br />I consider good games metaphors of the real world. They should be like great novels or movies that acquire artistic value.<br />One thing I don't really like is the voice of the English version, like the bear, not comparable to the original Japanese version, which is really hilarious.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|QUEEN, BY QUEEN. A LOOK FROM THE INSIDE. COMPREHENSIVE history of the group from inception (actually before) through the end. Interviews, concerts and evolution of a band that conquered the world. A tribute to QUEEN, but especially to FREDDY MERCURY. Individually they were giants. Together they were GENIUS. A COMPREHENSIVE look into their lives, their artistry and the MAJESTY that was FREDDY MERCURY.<br />I can't say enough good about this dvd. It covers so much and contains so much rare footage that very few have ever seen. I LOVED IT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.<br />The MUSIC and PERFORMANCES are INCREDIBLE, TRULY INCREDIBLE. AND THERE IS SO VERY MUCH MORE. I SO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!! Seeing QUEEN is not just watching a concert--Queen, and especially FREDDY MERCURY, is a full blown STAGESHOW. Their shows were \\"PRODUCTIONS\\". MERCURY'S ability to write, both words and music, his ability to perform and engage his audience (He Was a Natural),and his VOICE, OMG. THAT VOICE!!! QUEEN made an INDELIBLE mark on the history of ROCK and ROLL and ROCK PERFORMANCES. THEY ARE A GIFT!
B005LAII80|5.0|I had the opportunity to watch this movie in 3D and non-3D before its run in the theaters was over.  I watched the 3D version first and I was blown away with the ultra-slow motion and 3D accentuations.  The director did a wonderful job of portraying really brutal scenes artistically with the use of the slo-mo and 3D.  While it's true the story is similar to another recent release, The Raid, Dredd has enough differences to stand on its own (futuristic wasteland, Judges, sci-fi elements, and no martial arts).  While I am a comic book fan, I've never really read any Dredd comics but I'm familiar with his character.  Karl Urban does a fantastic job as Dredd and does so without ever removing his helmet.  Kudos!  This movie is a pure action flick so be prepared for a lot of shotouts and over the top action.  It was a shame so few went out to watch this film as it will definitely become a cult classic.  After watching the 3D version I decided to watch it again but in 2D for two reasons, 1) I really enjoyed the movie and wanted to see it again and 2) I wanted to support the film financially in hopes that a sequel would be considered/made.  So yes, I enjoyed the film enough to rescreen it and I was hoping/wanting a sequel to see where the directors would take these characters.  As for the 2D version, I liked it as well.  The slo-mo was still breath-taking, but this movie truly needs to be viewed in 3D, period.  I will definitely pre-order this combo and I recommend you do the same. :)
B008458O3S|1.0|I love this game, but it stopped working when jelly bean updated. Now it won't open at all, telling me that \\"Unfortunately, train yard has stopped\\" with no option to report the error.  Hope it gets fixed soon.
0756697875|5.0|Hooray that this book exists!  How can a mom go wrong?  Answer: she can't with a choice as perfect as this!!
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I was so glad to have found this for such an incredible price. The discs came well packaged and intact. The box was also very well protected. The series itself may be &#34;slow&#34; for someone who's accustomed to a fast-paced lifestyle, but it is quite soothing and educational.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I brought this book on the recommendation of Elizabeth Hunter who writes the Elemental Series which I adored, so I thought I would give it a go.<br /><br />Set in and alternative Victorian England Honoria has been left destitute by some action of her Fathers and Lord Vickers.  She has been left to look after her sister Lena and little brother Charlie who is sick.  Honoria keeps a very big secret and finds she is unable to trust anyone as her situation worsens she finds she has to turn to Blade the Devil of Whitechapel, the unoffical leader of the poor who has been infected with the Craving virus.<br /><br />The storyline is fantastic, I liked the characters and hoped for the best for them, altho I would like to slap Lena.  The plot has many a twist and turn to keep one entertained and the love story is intertwined and believable.<br /><br />You'd be mad not to buy it.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play solitaire. I spend a lot of time in doctor offices. and this is a quiet. way to pass the time.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I recommend this show and all of its seasons! It is very entertaining and fun to watch. If you like mystery, romance, drama, etc, then this is the show for you.
B003FXCSU4|5.0|Utterly brilliant. After an initially slow start and potentially confusing first few chapters, Ubik quickly turned into one of the best pieces of science fiction I've ever read. Why did I wait so long to start reading this genius body of work?
B008G59IKO|2.0|You know, ¡UNO! was really good. I liked all but 2 songs on that one. (I rated UNO 4 stars but Amazon didn't post it.)<br /><br />So I was eagerly awaiting ¡DOS!. I was excited to get it home and hear it. When I finally did, I was actually getting tired of listening to it on my first spin! By the time \\"Ashley\\" played, I was thinking, \\"Oh god, this sucks! Is this really Green Day? Whoa, total misfire with this one!\\"<br /><br />There are 6 tracks on ¡DOS! that destroyed this album for me: \\"Stop when the red lights flash\\" \\"Makeout party\\" \\"Ashley\\" \\"Lady Cobra\\" \\"Nightlife\\" \\"Wow! Thats loud\\".<br /><br />The ones I like are: \\"Lazy Bones\\" \\"Stray Heart\\" \\"Baby Eyes\\" \\"Amy\\"<br /><br />And the rest not mentioned are so-so.<br /><br />I think \\"Nightlife\\" changed how I look at Green Day now. I never thought they'd put rap into their music. It just feels very wrong to me. Green Day is rock, and now with ¡DOS!, they may be starting to lose their way...
B008WCP2KG|5.0|chose a high rating on this movie, because my night in with the girls was a blast.  I highly recommend this movie to the ladies out there that want to watch it.
B007NU54H4|5.0|We pre-ordered this before the release through Amazon since we could not pre-order it from Disney's own Movie Club.<br /><br />We got it the day it was released at home, received automatic price match.<br /><br />My 6 year old has watched it at least 10 times since and loves it.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for another great shopping experience.
B007X4ECLY|5.0|chose a high rating because I enjoyed watching this movie from the start to the end.  I don't think there a moment in this movie that was boring at all.  Highly recommend it.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|i really loved this app one reason is because if you press the wrong key than it makes that noise instead of no noise at all it also has some really good songs i love and  i could go on and on
B000H5U832|5.0|I love this DVD and for the price, you can't beat it. I purchased this DVD used and it works great! Highly recommend this product.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are incredible.  The sounds they create with cello and piano cannot be matched.  I have shared their music with friends, family,and coworkers and everyone loves them!  If their incredible sound doesn't convince you, check out their YouTube videos.  Buy this album and you won't be disappointed!
B000AY74OG|4.0|I like this DVD, I heard the second in the series is better and I just purchased that one. This DVD was a great price and although it was used it was in great condition.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Complex plot that moves quickly and the reader is engaged to the end.  Movie was good.  Book is even better.  Got it as a Kindle Loan from my local library.
B004G600A4|5.0|I love this DVD! It came used but plays perfect and the price was awesome! I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone, even someone who doesn't have kids. It's now one of my top 10 DVDs.
1451695195|4.0|\\"Heaven\\" aside: this is a fascinating story about the medical trauma endured by Dr. Eben Alexander, a prominent neurological surgeon who suffered life-threatening bacterial meningitis.  Dr. Alexander has written a heartrending book about his sudden, excruciatingly painful illness. His wife and sisters keep vigil at his bedside.  His young son struggles to cope; his hospital colleagues struggle to help.  Each person in this story is a genuine character who we come to care about as they move through grief and hope and ultimately to joy when he recovers. In particular, the back story of his own adoption (and search to connect with his birth family) is poignant, with mixed emotions all around.  As a doctor, Alexander includes background on neurology. How does the tissue of the human brain give rise to an intelligent \\"self?\\" Is there something beyond the cellular matter inside our head that makes us \\"us?\\" As he describes his own illness, he explains brain science clearly but with a sound technical basis, including the different schools of thought about how the brain gives rise to consciousness.<br /><br />Of course, the point of the book is Dr. Alexander's own near-death experience. He tells this story as authentically as possible, making clear when words are inadequate and when his metaphors are limited. Given these limitations, he does well evoking a reality where there is no physical sensation, no time as we know it, and no memory of earthly identity. There are only a few chapters that describe the \\"afterlife,\\" with much more of the book dedicated to his medical experience and the biology of the brain. But I was satisfied to see that quite a few things were included that had not been in the Newsweek article (a precursor to the book's release) and news stories about it. This includes his experience of a dark, claustrophobically fleshy realm and a much different realm of vast brightness that he experiences as being in the presence of God (although he is cautious about naming God and does not dwell on Christ or other organized religion - which will disappoint some as much as it appeals to others).  I'll also admit I was a little thrilled at the story of the \\"girl on the butterfly wing,\\" especially when he finally recognized her.<br /><br />I know it is a stretch to call this \\"proof.\\" It is one person's experience and it cannot be observed or repeated by others, as science requires. But death will always be that way. It is fascinating that, with all we can know about human biology, the mystery of consciousness and death remain just out of our grasp. Those who want to disbelieve Dr. Alexander's story will do so.  That is human nature, and we're all skeptics about something -- it takes doubt as well as faith to keep humanity's quest for knowledge driving ever forward.  For those who are inclined to believe, or who are not sure, Dr. Alexander's story is certainly food for thought. Personally I cannot say I'm 100% convinced. But I will say that in my own soul, the images and experience he described resonated with a feeling not unlike familiarity.  IF this is true - if Heaven is out there- it might well be like this.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I work with kid and this is the only DVD they all watch and love! I would highly recommend any parent or anyone to buy this DVD! I bought it used and it works just fine!
B0042J6VUS|2.0|It looks great. But it's hard to put the cell phone on the tripod because the adjustable holder is so hard to open/widen to hold it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is a classic. I love the Lion King and grew up watching it. I would recommend this DVD to anyone and purchased it used but it works great!

B0073X0IOA|3.0|Good aspects of this book have been said by most of the other reviewers. The main problem with such books is that for slightly experienced problem solvers, this book probably does not provide a whole lot of information as to what needs to be done to get better. For instance, for a kid who is in 10th grade struggling with math, this is a very good book. For a kid who is in his 11th grade trying for math Olympiad or for people looking at Putnam, this book won't provide much help.<br /><br />Most people simply say that \\"practice makes perfect\\". When it comes to contest level problems, it is not as simple as that. There are experienced trainers like Professor Titu Andreescu who spend a lot of time training kids to get better. There is lot more to it than simply trying out tough problems.<br /><br />The most common situation occurs when you encounter extremely tough questions like the Olympiad ones. Most people simply sit and stare at the problem and don't go beyond that. Even the kids who are extremely fast with 10th grade math miserably fail. Why?<br /><br />The ONE book which explains this is titled \\"Mathematical Problem Solving\\" written by Professor Alan Schoenfeld. It is simply amazing. A must buy. In case you have ever wondered why, in spite of being lightning fast in solving textbook exercises in the 10th and 11th grade, you fail in being able to solve even a single problem from the IMO, you have to read this book. I am surprised to see Polya's book getting mentioned so very often bu nobody ever mentions Schoenfeld's book. It is a must read book for ANY math enthusiast and the math majors.<br /><br />After reading this book, you will possibly get a picture as to what is involved in solving higher level math problems especially the psychology of it. You need to know that as psychology is one of the greatest hurdles to over when it comes to solving contest problems. Then you move on to \\"Thinking Mathematically\\" written by J. Mason et al. It has problems which are only few times too hard but most of the times, have just enough \\"toughness\\" for the author to make the point ONLY IF THE STUDENT TRIES THEM OUT.<br /><br />The next level would be Paul Zeitz's The Art and Craft of Problem Solving. This book also explains the mindset needed for solving problems of the Olympiad kind. At this point, you will probably realize what ExACTLY it means when others say that \\"problem solving is all about practice\\". All the while you would be thinking \\"practice what? I simply cannot make the first move successfully and how can I practice when I can't even solve one problem even when I tried for like a month\\". It is problem solving and not research in math that you are trying to do. You will probably get a better picture after going through the above three books.<br /><br />Finally, you can move on to Arthur Engel's Problem Solving Strategies and Titu Andreescu's Mathematical Olympiad Challenges if you managed to get to this point. There is also problem solving through problems by Loren Larson. These are helpful only if you could solve Paul Zeitz's book successfully.<br /><br />To conclude, if you are looking for guidance at the level of math Olympiad, look for other books. This book won't be of much assistance. On the other hand, if you are simply trying to get better at grade school math, this book will be very useful.ly few times too hard but most of the times, have just enough \\"toughness\\" for the author to make the point ONLY IF THE STUDENT TRIES THEM OUT.<br /><br />The next level would be Paul Zeitz's The Art and Craft of Problem Solving.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|well worth the thirty bucks i spent on it at walmart! a must have for any scifi collection...i would recommend it to any one into scifi!!
B003JTHS5E|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations!  I highly recommend it as required reading for all adults of all ages who have not previously read any of Gary Chapman's books about the 5 love languages.  It gives useful information about relating to all people that we care about, whether they be spouse, child, parent, sibling, friend, or in-law.
B009PAETCG|1.0|worst game ever!!!!!!! not worth getting. ever time I tired to play the game it would just go to the app store.
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|Although in no way a literary masterpiece when it comes to writing style (to be very fair), this book is a great read and even as a guy - has opened my eyes to the dark world of eating disorders. My only complaint would be the over-mention of Ellen within the book - granted that she encouraged Portia to pen this book (after her mother's successful book) and helped her in many other ways. But there are some extremely unbelievably cheesy mentions of her in the book that made me just roll my eyes - like (in my own words) &#34;Lying on a beach, years and years before meeting Ellen, I was reading her book, all inspired by her, and got pissed that my crush did not even know who this super important person was!&#34; Suck up much?! Lol. But in any other case, I would definitely recommend it - and went through my own copy in two days. Read on!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|it was ok its just that every time I hook up the charger while I'm playing on it it gos to the app but I like it because it gives me the axact percentage
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Haven't received my new power cord but had to comment on the great customer service I just experienced at Amazon. Amazing. I have been wrestling with that mess of a cord for over a year, fighting it with electrical tape, etc. I finally broke down to order another one and they are shipping it to me at no charge and no shipping charges. I LOVE AMAZON. Thank you!

1469984202|2.0|Honesty demands that I warn you: this book is NOT for everyone.  Because of the current dearth of good fantasy/sci-fi novels, I searched the interwebs for recommendations and kept seeing WOOL come up. Amazon's reviews seemed almost contrived they were so positive! I bought the modestly priced \\"tangible copy and read every single word of the humongous tome...<br /><br />A thousand-page book does not mean it's a saga, nor does it mean that it is going to enthrall you for hours of bedside pleasure. The ENTIRE plot of this book could be summed up in a short, elementary paragraph:  A post-apocalyptic group of people are separated into Noah's Ark-like silos and are governed by politicians who make real-life public servants seem absolute geniuses.<br /><br />What does this book have going for it? The grammar works. The character development is expansive, though mostly uninteresting.  The title is cleverer than the entire premise...which the author never quite seems to be able to deliver in an exciting way.  You will find yourself skimming paragraphs at a time because of the tiresome exposition. You will scan for dialogue in the desperate hope of finding anything to perk your interest.<br /><br />You know those stories that build up slowly with clues to something you hope is going to be mind-blowing? They attempt, with mild success, to keep you reading for an epiphany, a literary pay-off.  Well, with WOOL, if you are patient through the author's game of 'intellectual' bread-crumbs, if you stay focused for a couple hundred pages (at the beginning) to solve the 'hook clue' about what's going on in the story, you'll be rewarded with it turning out to be EXACTLY what you expected. It may be harsh, but it's like scanning for quality porn to get your rocks off, but you eventually have to give up as a bad job. You finish the book feeling tired, used, and cheapened.<br /><br />I won't say this is the worst sci-fi book I've ever read, in fact, it's decent writing, if quite, quite dull.  However, I can saw with utter conviction, this is the most over-hyped book on Amazon.  You will not spend any time in reflection about the story after finishing it. You definitely will not re-read it.  It's one of those hipster novels--you may love the \\"idea\\" of the book more than the book itself.  I rate the book a solid 2/5 stars...would've been a 2.5 if the author had given me a 'happy ending.'
B0098VXMNE|3.0|If you liked Kirk Douglas as Spartacus, you're going to hate this Spartacus. The original Blood and Sand series had better writing. This series, Vengeance, was written by writers banging their \\"tools\\" on the key pad hoping for anything intellligent to come. eh-hem,Come out
0425263916|5.0|Everybody has an opinion on this, but I will add a song to the playlist: Chained by XX. And an actor if this is ever made into a movie. Ian Somerholder from Vampire Diaries is much better suited for this than he would be for Fifty Shades. I love this series, more than Fifty Shades, which is saying a lot.
0307891372|5.0|I forgot how much i paid for this...$15? maybe less? Whatever I paid the book is huge!!!!!! and filled with so many pictures!!!!! I can't believe they can even afford to sell it so cheap. It's pretty complicated, but it doesn't matter, because I only used it when I needed to know something specific.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book. I love the books Jeff Kinney writes a hope he writes many more magnificent books. I wished it never ended. I hope you read this it is very good. It is great from ages 8-14. First you need to read the other books first. Than you can read this one just so you get to know Greg good.
0143112724|1.0|My review is based on the content.... it's mostly about &#34;how to&#34; write the &#34;correct way&#34;, and the current &#34;rules&#34; of literature. I'm sorry, but times have changed, and some of the things expressed in this book are simply not said/written in modern society.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This is a GREAT record..its nothing like \\"old\\" SG..it doesn't have to be..when I first popped this cd in my truck I was smiling..knew they wouldnt dissapoint..its worth buying new..support the band and.their efforts..enjoy!
B009R9WAZ8|3.0|I've never been a fan of Rihanna's I've always seen her as a trademark rather than an actual artist. Yes, she releases an album every year for the last seven years & she's clearly here to stay. Even with the various stages of her career her supposed transmission from a good girl who sings about Umbrellas to a bad girl with outrageous lyrical content and some overly provocative music videos I still couldn't make myself appreciate her work. Her songs were always a guilty pleasure for me nothing I would take seriously but this album actually made me have second thoughts.<br /><br />I would say this is the best album Rihanna has made so far, Yes there always have to be at least one meaningless sex/club song that doesn't make sense in the slightest and doesn't add anything to a person's life but this time the good outweighed the bad. There are songs that are actually worth listening to quite the pleasant surprise coming from Rihanna Especially, songs that I won't mind recommending to people, something different and refreshing other than the usual \\"na na na na's and la la la's\\" we hear so often in Rihanna's songs and there's even a Christian Song in this album which is most surprising let me just say.<br /><br />You should definitely give this album a try. Listen to Love Without Tragedy, Diamonds, Stay and What Now. The rest of the songs has some catchy beats to it like Loveee song feat.Future, Lost in Paradise and Right Now feat. David Guetta. I couldn't care less for Fresh off the Runway or Nobody's Business another Chris Brown/Rihanna Collaboration *I honestly think it's more of a publicity stunt following the footsteps of Birthday Cake except we all know what it means now. And Get it over with is just a filler in my opinion.<br /><br />Based on my previous Rihanna album review Talk That Talk trust me it's very surprising for me to give her 3 stars but this time I appreciate the effort. Tracks such as Diamonds and What Now are a step in the right direction and I hope she could keep it up maybe it's a sign for good things to come?he could keep it up maybe it's a sign for good things to come?
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|OMG!  just got the cd and I am blown away. Loved her version of music of the night with michael Crawford....BUT...the duo with Donnie Osmond is simply amazing! FREAKIN ..WOW! all I ask of you!!!! beautiful!
B0095R64AO|4.0|If I could rate this at 3.5 stars I would. Its a decent movie with decent actors. Five years later the female is the one that kept putting things on hold due to her job. I do not want to be a spoiler but the whole movie is based on her getting promoted and then has a cheat with her teacher.  He moves on and does his dream job which is cooking and she misses him for them to both finally meet back up after trying to move on with other people.
B005603236|4.0|Firstly, we now know how to pronounce the title.  Jane Austen's sister, Cassandra wrote it in her notebook as 'North Hanger Abbey' .  A Hanger is a small wood that 'hangs' on a hillside.  So no more 'North Anger' or 'Northanjer'  please - though it should be said that the cast can't settle on a single pronunciation either.<br /><br />I wont recap the plot - Austen saw it as 'sparkling' in the manner of Pride and Prejudice, rather than the more serious novels,  and Andrew Davies has done a great job with the adaptation, including some fairly lurid imaginings of the heroine Catherine's fantasies.<br /><br />For me, the standout performance was J.J. Feild as Henry Tilney.  For many Henry is Austen's most delightful hero - he is such a tease! and J.J. Feild has captured him perfectly.  However all the others in the cast were great, particularly Corey Mulligan as the disingenuous Isabella, and Sylvestra Le Touzel as Mrs Allen.<br /><br />A great adaptation of a less well known Austen.
B009329Y30|4.0|Really good movie based on a marine that finds a photo of a beautiful girl that when he goes to pick up her photo a bomb explodes in the spot he was suppose to be standing.  He comes back to the US and searches for this girl. Meets her and she is stand offish but the mother likes him. After he gets hired to take care of their animals on a daily bases they fall in love with each other. The ex boyfriend is a cop and tries to complicate things by filling her in that he is sort of stalking her. Love still over comes and they make up.
B008G33NFC|5.0|I was wondering why a lot of complaints re the blu-ray is pasted on the standard dvd page. First, the manufacturing company should have checked and secondly, all defective discs should be replaced. I bought mine from tarja's \\"pledge music\\" site that came complete with a mediabook beautifully bound. The performances are hell brilliant with bands performing at top notch and tarja's singing is without doubt perfect and very emotional driven. The crowds (fans) were equally ecstatic which sums up that this is one hell of a live dvd.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie is decent. Its a rental type movie. Do not buy the DVD.  The plot is basically a alien type animal is trying to take out human life . They are super strong and very hard to kill. They are able to find humans through any type of cell phone or communication device .  It takes half the movie for them to figure this out. Ok movie but nothing spectacular from a SCI-FIE movie. Same old boring plot.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I tend to think if a book is going to be made into a movie, it probably is worth reading.  That was what finally made me decide to buy this one.<br /><br />I did not find this book to be an 'easy read'..for me it was a tiny bit of a challenge to tie everything from Chapter to Chapter together.  I (almost) never 're-read' a book, but I have gone back to this one again and again in the past month.  I am really curious to see how the movie will deal with this without losing the depth of meaning.<br /><br />I have never really done book reviews, so this is very amateurish...however, I wanted to share what a great read I found this to be.  Not for everyone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy the game. I like the ability to move up in difficulty and using the hints.  Its just all around good fun.)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love all the different ideas and how to make or create them. Makes me feel crafty and creative even tho I'm not. Wonderful!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Unbelievable book! Gillian Flynn did a remarkable job keeping me guessing the whole time. Just when I thought I figured it out, I was blindsided by something new. Rarely do I walk away from a book feeling so much emotion for a character!
1742200206|5.0|As someone who has visited NYC more than a dozen times in the past 3 years, including extended stays in a variety of locations, I have low expectations of learning from travel guides.  Lonely Planet is one of my favorite travel publishers and this book does not disappoint.  This books hits all the high spots, including tourist favorites and lesser known jewels alike.  It tipped me off to several restaurants and cultural locations that I will definitely try on my next visit.<br /><br />The book is a decent size to carry in my purse and its layout is very pleasing to the eye.  Use of color images and high quality paper are a nice plus as well.  It doesn't feel like its going to fall apart after one or two uses.  For my travels I will still rely on the [[ASIN:1620870835 Not For Tourists Guide to New York City 2013 (Not for Tourists Guidebook)]], but I will definitely recommend this title to friends who are visiting the city for the first time.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I love this series. Nesbo really can write a good tale.This one is very well done with great surprise ending.  Highly recommend it
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Lots of info on battery, CPU usage and program battery use. Well worth the small cost. Graphs of usage and estimated usage left while using various features.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love this game! A great merging of two franchises. And for those who are griping about paying for the Dagobah levels, paying for them is optional. You can also unlock them by 3 starring all the other levels.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|My head was humming as I sat through the theatrical release.<br /><br />It carried on humming when I pre-ordered the Deluxe version.<br /><br />Pressure continued to build when Amazon sent me a text telling me it had been delivered.<br /><br />And the humming continues as I watch the DVD.<br /><br />Fantastic.  As always the stageshow is a critical part of the live Zeppelin experience.  The CDs sound great but the DVD is better (linear PCM, Dolby 5.1 etc).<br /><br />Just one niggle...the \\"gatefold\\" photo of the four on stage has Page, Plant and Jones showing some severely rock-heavy pouting.  It looks silly.  Should have just been Plant.  I mean, it really looks daft.<br /><br />Buy it.<br /><br />[EDIT]<br /><br />Okay, I've had a chance to listen to this more critically.  Artistically, still nothing to gripe about.  I love it.  BUT the mastering of the audio for the CD is terrible.  The EQ is awful - way, way too much bottom end and, in places, almost monophonic.  In my car I have to adjust the bass way down - usually I have to do the opposite.  Listening through my reference headphones confirms the near mono.  Some tracks do have a good stereo image but others have almost none.  Neither are true for the PCM audio on the DVDs.<br /><br />This product seems to have been a bit of a rush job - there are some inexcusable flaws such as the CD vs. DVD audio mastering and the notes in the accompanying booklet.  Someone really messed up the typesetting on Jimmy Page's, er, page.<br /><br />Scouring the booklet, the CDs, DVDs and every other part of text reveals that Jimmy Page did NOT produce this product.  His only credit (other than god) is for \\"audio supervision\\".  I suspect that means the mixing and (perhaps) mastering for the DVD/BD audio.  Someone else took ownership of creating the CD masters.  Clearly, no-one proof-read the booklet before it went to press.  And the pouting still looks silly.<br /><br />It's a shame that there are some almost amateur mistakes.  Actually, it's more than a shame.<br /><br />I will most likely take the audio from the DVD and create my own CDs and mp3s.  The CDs I paid for just don't have the Jimmy Page production quality and even I can improve on the shoddy workmanship.<br /><br />But the DVD rocks!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's like bejeweled but with an bonus of actually trying to accomplish something.  It also has some variances that make it more difficult.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I'm not a huge Killers fan but do have all their albums. I find this album very enjoyable to listen too. I will concede it is more mainstream then others they have done, but I do not think that is bad. My daughter (17) enjoyed this album upon first listen and she is not a Killers fan. Well worth a try.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book appeals to old and young.  My 11 year old is reading it after I recommended it.  It is a heartwarming story that teaches great lessons to all ages. I really enjoyed it myself!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app does the job and more. easy to figure out too. even the free version has a lot of features. i recommend it.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|I was intrigued with this movie.  I had been considering reading the book for a while but I'm not a big fan of the civil war area.  Hence why I went the movie route. It wasn't the time area that disappointed it was the disjointed acting and story line.  Nothing really seemed to flow together.  *SPOILER*...Really, he's 50 years old, hasn't fought vampires in 30 years and he gets on a train and kills them all....
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really, really liked this movie.  Great acting, great replication of the look and feel of the comic book, and incredible special effects.  Oh yes, and it was a great plot as well!
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Love the mix of just about all genres tied into one well plotted series. The acting is great and there are some really great characters to enjoy as well.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have this on my phone and kindle fire on my phone I'm on level 85 its that awesome on my kindle I just got the app I'm on level 7 I think you should get this game
B009DT98RK|5.0|My how time flys! Seems like yesterday I was watching a much younger Peter Frampton doing his live show at the \\"Day on the Green\\" concert held at the Oakland Coliseum back in 1976. About the only thing that has changed is the length of his hair. His guitar playing has only improved over the years.<br /><br />The first part of this concert is a complete run-through of his historic \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" album that in essence captapulted Peter into instant super-stardom back in 1976. Many memorable tunes here all done with an energy and love that shows Peter still enjoys playing this stuff. His self-deprecating sense of humor(lack of hair, etc.) shows his personable side and keeps you entertained. The band is solid and the keyboardist really cranks it up a notch on \\"Do You Feel Like I Do\\".<br /><br />The second half of the show is, I assume, Peter's more recent works. To put it bluntly, Peter smokes like I've never seen him play before. This guy hasn't missed a beat in all these years and his chops are smokin hot. Lots of extended guitar solos and the band does a great job keepin up with Mr. Frampton. He even has his son Julian come out and sing a couple........VERY touching and he's actually quite the talent himself. It's obvious that Peter is a VERY proud papa.<br /><br />As far as the video and sound quality goes..... it's top notch, first rate. The audio is especially well mixed, clean and full sounding and nothing seems to overpower or seems missing in this high-def blu-ray mix. Highly recommended.
B008RTE09S|3.0|We waited years in the U.S.A. for \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" to be released and eventually it did see the light of day on cable TV and video release decades too late.  The main saving grace is the music itself, some of the Beatles finest to be sure.  However the film itself was a disappointment to me.  In the \\"spirit\\" of the times it had a very loosely defined point which is to say there isn't much of a plot.  But most die hard Beatles fans will want this in their collection of course and now we have it on Blu-ray.  I'm writing this just to alert potential buyers that it may be wise to shop around for a better price.  At this date, Thanksgiving eve 2012, I've seen it at Target for their everyday price of $19.99 for the Blu-ray edition.  They did not carry the deluxe version or at least I didn't see it.  I would guess that other retailers have about that price, as Target tends to price according to local market competition (Wal-Mart, Best Buy, etc.).  For such a less than best film it's probably worth finding a lower price but I wouldn't wait too long as this may be one of those items that becomes rare down the road.  Anyone want a Beatles \\"Anthology\\" box set of VHS tapes?  Happy Holidays.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I am so glad this artist's first album reflects who he is.  I hate it when someone wins American Idol, then their debut album is some pop crap with nothing to do with who that artist wanted to be.  Bravo, Phillip.  This album showcases the artist and his songwriting skills.

B00917IQFY|5.0|While not intended to be a sequel to the band's work from the 70's, GP and the Rumour have offered a solid start-to-finish release of smart, biting and wonderfully crafted music for both diehard fans, and people new to their work.  Chalk this up to another fine addition to Parker's resume'.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it helps with everything in life well almost everything. It also is a great tool for when you r in a difficult situation likenwhen ur doing math and like u don't wanna actually do it so u use a calculator

After the 20th time...I decided to order the two seasons and I sat and watched the whole series in a few days. I loved every....minute of it and ended up ordering the next installment.  I'm excited for the end of January to get my order.

0738711500|4.0|I bought these to use as a prop on Halloween but I was pretty impressed with the box, the book and the cards themselves.  The artwork is nice and the cards are a good size...what...about 1.5 times the size of playing cards.  I am only giving this 4 stars because I did not use them for tarot, have not read the book yet and am not qualified to determine thier suitability for actual Tarot reading.  :-)
B005USZYDU|3.0|I hate to break it to Grisham fans but this is my first bk of his and and I'm giving it 3 stars. I enjoyed it. I think it would make a good cute PG kids movie. Theodore is a cute clever character. I read the bk two as wel just cause. The third one...alright. But it's only cause theodore is a cute kid Lawyer.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not in the top 20% of Grishams work. It was entertaining but not great. I would not count this in books I would read again.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|This app is inferior to free apps!!!!It tells the weather?sure it does.But its only a five day forecast and as descriptive as my drunk uncle telling me the weather.And you have to pay!I don't reccomend this app for anyone.The best weather mobile app is the Weather Channel app in Google Play or in this very same Amazon Market.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of John Grishams best novels. This is a book you don't want to put down. The plot is so good and keeps you in suspence until the end.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I think there was too much hype built around this book. I kept reading it waiting to see what all the fuss was about...nothing. Some friends however loved it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just like a regular calculator works great I use it for just about everything and it does the job perfectly I haven't had any trouble and I'm glad I got it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Just got it and so far, it's been interesting and enjoyable. It seems a nice and fun way to spend time while having some free time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game. I never get tired of it.  love the different levels..putting different names in lets me play over and over!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Looks like the same old songs, but the crossover compositions and combinations using three or more songs is amazing.  Blast the sound and lose yourself in the best music blend you every experienced.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Everything about this movie is bad.<br /><br />I sat in the theater in awe at the mind-numbing stupidity of it all. Sometimes things can be so bad that they magically become good. But in this cases I have to disagree with a previous reviewer and say, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES. Every time I thought it couldn't get any worse, it got worse. \\"No they couldn't possibly go there.\\" Yes they did.<br /><br />I wanted to leave the theater, but by then the stupidity had paralyzed my nervous system and I watched in horror as the galloping inanity rolled over me. When the movie finally ended, and I regained the ability to function, I felt very much like I needed to go home and put my brain in the washing machine.<br /><br />Don't let this happen to you.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I rented this movie for my 4 year old who loves all things Disney.  I found that my 14 year old and myself enjoyed this movie just as much as my 4 year old did!  I would recommend!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show has great characters, great plots and very engaging. I think everyone should check it out. check it out
1423136802|5.0|I read the first book because I had to in a mythology class, and then I was hooked. This set has all five Percy Jackson and the Olympians books. All were great. If you haven't read any of them yet, I suggest you go ahead and buy the set instead of one book at a time, because you won't want to wait to read the next! I just finished the third book of the follow-up series (by this time, our little twelve year old Percy is about grown), and I can't wait to get my hands on the fourth one next Fall!<br />It's goofy, but the actual Greek mythology is well researched and clever. It's not just a kid's book, either, and it helps you remember all the Greek mythology if you have a class on it.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I actually saw the movie first since I'm not a huge fan of trilogies but the ending made to read the second book so I started from the beginning. Great book and, surprisingly, the movie did a pretty good job of keeping up. Had some interesting twists!

B007L6VR12|3.0|Wes Anderson's films are an acquired taste.<br />From \\"Rushmore\\", \\"Bottle Rocket\\" to \\"Royal Tannenbaum\\", \\"Darjeeling Limited\\" and \\"Life Aquatic\\", I've seen most of his<br />films with the exception \\"Mr. Fox\\". I've got similar impressions after watching each of his films, light, quirky(including the names of the films), colorful with not much of a story and did not leave much impressions afterwards.<br />This film is no exception.  It has great production design, engaging actors, some from top drawers, colorful and quirky<br />but it is so light that did not make a good movie watching experience, for me.  It was like reading a comic book for children.  Love him, or dislike him, Wes Anderson.

1451695195|5.0|In the past few years I've read a lot of NDEs.  My interest was started by reading a book by a hospice nurse called [[ASIN:B005UDIC3E Final Gifts]].  Since then I've read numerous accounts.  They all are quite similar, and are all quite comforting.  Dr. Eben's message of<br /><br />* 'You are loved and cherished, deeply, forever.\\"<br />* \\"You have nothing to fear.\\"<br />* \\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\"<br /><br />Is repeated in many of them.  As is \\"love\\" being the purpose/main goal of life.<br /><br />Having many physicians in my family, the fact that this book as well as Dr. Mary Neal's book [[ASIN:0307731715 To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story]] are both written by physicians gives them a little more weight.  Especially Dr. Alexander's...and his ability to look at the scans of when he was in a coma and realize that the creative part of his brain was dead at the time.<br /><br />I think all would benefit from reading this book.... especially those who are facing illness or a family member's death.<br /><br />It's a wonderfully engaging book... you don't want to put it down.  I found it more accessible and easier reading than [[ASIN:1401937519 Dying To Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing]], which I enjoyed.  Sorry if this review does not do it justice.

B007L6VR12|4.0|This quirky, sometimes goofy young romance tale focuses upon a small island community in the 1960s which is so idyllic that it probably never existed. Minor annoyances turn into big crisis which gets the whole community involved at times and several of the characters have deadpan deliveries which reminds you this is a film by Wes Anderson. In fact, the case that the actors are not pushing for laughs adds to the quality of this picture.<br /><br />Tale focuses upon an insular community which boils its problems over as an impending disaster flood hits the community. Our big \\"crisis\\" however is between two young lovers  (12 year old Sam and Suzy, who seems to be close to him in age) who fall in love, become pen-pals, agree to run away together and name their secret cove \\"The Moonrise Kingdom\\" (influenced by the fantasy books read by the girl). Did I mention both of these kids are socially maladjusted and might have some issues upon reaching adulthood? Look for how Suzy uses those scissors, people. Ouch.<br /><br />Anyway . . .<br /><br />The child actors (played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) are up to the task of matching the impressive ensemble cast (one could argue they are a supporting cast): a subdued Bruce Willis, Bill Murray as his usual melancholy self, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton as a Dudley Do Right Cub Scout leader, Jason Schwartzman in a conniving role, Harvey Keitel in a small supporting role and Tilda Swinton (is she wearing a red wig?) as the ominous \\"Social Services\\". The fellow cub scouts to the Sam character had some characters of their own, too.<br /><br />Gotham Awards has currently nominated this feature for \\"Best Picture\\" and \\"Best Ensemble Performance\\". The budget was $16M for this feature and so far it made a bit over $65M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; THEME DELIVERIES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid November 2012.

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|This prelude to the beloved \\"Alien\\" franchise series had been in preproduction since the early 2000s. The idea was to do an origin tale of how the horrible creatures came into existence.<br /><br />Tale focuses upon a science team researching early civilizations which leads them to another planet where human beings were possibly created. It begins with clues and mysteries and then leads to violence, action and especially horror. I found the characters all over the board in quality though nobody was below average.<br /><br />I suspect the biggest problem was that the cast was too big for the plotting but I wonder if Scott will come out with an extended edition and then the movie will be better with the extra 30-60 minutes. Time will tell. This is a movie that you see more for the visuals than one in which you appreciate the tale or the awesome characters.<br /><br />Starring a number of known actors/actresses: Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba and Noomi Rapace.<br /><br />As of August 2012 Fox is in the works for a sequel. The budget for this picture was $130M and it made over $402M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid November 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B.<br /><br />SPOILER: some of the scientists were idiots like the dudes who let the coils wrap around them and tried to baby talk it. They must have been the intern dropouts. Heh. There were other moves that seemed like idiot scientist moves, too.<br /><br />Okay so the alien shows up at the very end but don't you think there would have been more tension if the aliens had shown up at the very end in some capacity? According to some online sources Ridley Scott didn't want to go there but I think he missed a chance to create a better story.

B008S847X2|5.0|This is probably the best fusion album I have heard in at least the last 4-5 years. From the first tune, you will hear a solid, tight band with phenomenal keyboards, solid, thick bass playing and a secure, reliable, always creative drummer.<br />McLaughlin stands alone as one of the best guitar players in fusion music today.  His solos are consistently phenomenal and very, very exciting. The band interaction is also interesting and keeps you following the different, very well set theme lines.<br />The new sound that this band conveys  is a treasure for fusion lovers like myself.<br />If you actually love and understand fusion music, look no further, purchase this album as you will have hours of enjoyment.

B009FBX5M0|4.0|Coming in to write the music for your first James Bond movie must be a massively daunting task. In composing the score for Skyfall, Thomas Newman - the multi-Oscar nominated composer of such seminal scores as American Beauty and The Shawshank Redemption - not only had to cope with 50 years of cinematic history after Ursula Andress first slinked out of the Caribbean sea in Dr. No in 1962, but legions of fans who treat the movie franchise as sacred property, and the legacy of the legendary music of John Barry and his heir-apparent, David Arnold. The `James Bond sound' is so iconic and so well-established that it presents a composer as unique as Newman with a dilemma: does he abandon his own sound in an attempt to fit in with the overall sound of the series, risking giving up the very thing that makes him him, or does he compose music in his own inimitable way, establishment be damned, risking the wrath of those who would then surely accuse him of not being `Bond' enough? It's a challenging tightrope, and one which Newman had to skillfully navigate.<br /><br />Skyfall is the 23rd film based on Ian Fleming's legendary character James Bond, and the third starring Daniel Craig in the iconic title role, after Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The film is directed by Sam Mendes - who worked with Newman previously on the films American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead and Revolutionary Road - and sees Bond trotting across the globe from Britain to Turkey, Shanghai, Macau, and back again, on the trail of the megalomaniacal Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a brilliant cyber-terrorist who has a personal vendetta against \\"M\\" (Judi Dench), the head of Britain's elite secret spy agency, MI6. It's an exciting film, with some superb visual touches courtesy of the brilliant director of photography Roger Deakins, and a terrific supporting performance from Bardem, who makes his character the most flamboyant and archetypal `Bond villain' in quite some time. However, the film is hampered somewhat by a series of glaring logical lapses in its second half, and a disappointing over-reliance on convenient contrivances to drive the plot along. This does not seem to have affected box office takings for the film, though; at the time of writing the film has grossed $161 million in the United States, and almost $700 million world-wide.<br /><br />Thomas Newman has never written an all-out action score before. Scores such as The Adjustment Bureau and, to a lesser extent, Angels in America, The Debt, and Cinderella Man, had action elements, but this is the first time that the primary thrust of a Newman score has been action - and, it must be said, he's pretty good at it. The action cues, of which there are a great number, are a more conventionally orchestral extension of the contemporary action sound composers like John Powell and James Newton Howard created for films such as The Bourne Identity, although Newman's music has a much richer orchestral and instrumental palette than Powell's, and relies less on synthesized and electronic enhancements.<br /><br />Cues such as the opening \\"Grand Bazaar Istanbul\\", \\"Jellyfish\\", \\"The Bloody Shot\\", \\"Enquiry\\", \\"She's Mine\\" and \\"Deep Water\\" are tremendously exciting, often incorporating syncopated percussion rhythms, electric guitar chords, flashing string writing and thrilling trumpet blasts within a large and powerful orchestra. Unlike his brother David, who often excels in this arena, Thomas Newman had never shown any evidence that his action music could be this good, but his aptitude in creating a series of thrilling, musically interesting action set-pieces is encouraging, albeit tinged with a certain sense of relief that he could actually pull it off.<br /><br />Occasionally, the precision of the orchestrations in these cues reminds me of the music Alexandre Desplat wrote for his action scores, such as Firewall and Hostage, and Newman isn't afraid to play around with unusual instrumentation to carry the thrust of thecue: the bass flute sections of \\"Enquiry\\" are excellent, as is the vaguely Indian-inflected string writing in the conclusive \\"Adrenaline\\".<br /><br />There are few overt statements of John Barry's legendary James Bond theme; it usually appears subtly, either deconstructed as part of a string ostinato or a countermelody to the main action, or in short, but recognizable bursts whenever Bond does something especially cool. Notable moments include the opening two-note salvo at the beginning of \\"Grand Bazaar Istanbul\\", the almost subliminal performance deep down in the mix of \\"Someone Usually Dies\\", the fanfare-like abridged versions in \\"The Bloody Shot\\" and \\"Enquiry\\", the heraldic deconstructed performance in \\"The Chimera\\", and the last few moments of \\"Granborough Road\\" before it eventually bursts out during the old-school and defiantly nostalgic \\"Breadcrumbs\\".<br /><br />In the finale, especially in the aforementioned action set-pieces \\"She's Mine\\" and \\"Deep Water\\", the chord structures and instrumental flavors of the Bond theme are everywhere, although Newman still refuses to outwardly play the theme in full, even during these pivotal moments. You get four notes here, a little allusion there, a hint of the countermelody there. It's clear what Newman is doing - bringing the flavor of Bond to his own sound - but it's still a frustrating experience when you hear all these hints and echoes, and are waiting for a full-on statement of a theme which never comes.<br /><br />Even more elusive is the melody from the main song, \\"Skyfall\\", which was written by Adele and Paul Epworth, and is performed over the opening credits by Adele, but does not appear on the soundtrack CD. A big, ballsy ballad in the classic Shirley Bassey tradition, the only appearance of its theme in the score itself is during the lovely \\"Komodo Dragon\\" cue, an establishing scene of Bond's moonlit arrival at a Macanese casino via a pontoon surrounded by candles and floating lotus flowers.<br /><br />The rest of the score is a little less interesting, but at least manages to maintain a sense of itself throughout its running time, keeping much to the same palette of instruments, and driving the film forward adequately. It is in these moments that the more familiar Thomas Newman comes to the fore; the tapped percussion, intertwining rhythmic ideas, and unusual instrumental colors that have defined a great deal of his career, and the way he applies them to this setting is at times quite fascinating. There are echoes of scores as wide and varied as Wall-E (listen to \\"Health & Safety\\"), The Debt, and even Lemony Snicket, leaving you in no doubt that this is definitely a Thomas Newman score to its bones.<br /><br />However, having said all that, the one thing missing from Skyfall is a distinct identity of its own. With just one single performance of Adele's new song melody, and only subtle allusions to John Barry's famous theme, you can only rely on interesting orchestrations and action set-pieces for so long before it starts to get a little samey, with little to distinguish it from other action scores of its ilk. There's no great romantic theme for a Bond girl, no recognizable central point that you can look at and identify as being distinctly Skyfall. Goldfinger, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and all the other classic Bond scores have an identifiable element to them that instantly introduce themselves as being both unique scores in the own right while clearly maintaining their place in a bigger musical scheme of things. Skyfall doesn't have that; it's well composed, interesting, exciting, and true to both Thomas Newman's own sound and that of the Bond series, but it's frustratingly anonymous.<br /><br />I wouldn't exactly say that Newman has played it safe, but Skyfall seems to inhabit a world between worlds that's trying to satisfy everyone at once: it's like John Barry, but not quite like John Barry; it's like David Arnold, but not quite like David Arnold; and it's like Thomas Newman, but not quite in a way that we've ever heard before. I liked a lot of it a great deal, and found the depth of the actual musical construction fascinating. Similarly, the action sequences are where it excels the most, and Newman completely dispels the myth that he wouldn't be capable of handling the propulsive music requires for them. However, it's unfortunate lack of a truly distinct identity is likely to hold it back from being a truly beloved entry into the series, and will likely alienate the vast majority of casual mainstream listeners who don't listen to the score as deeply and intently as I did.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green invaded my life one week last month. Searching for some captivating videos on you tube to show my high school social studies classes, I stumbled on Green's brilliant &#34;Crash Course&#34; videos- he has basically become the Bill Nye of History. That same week I stumbled upon John Green's books while browsing the Kindle store. I saw the excellent reviews and decided to give it a go in spite of the seemingly depressing content matter. Once I started, I was engrossed. You will be immersed and the world around you will fade away- exactly what a great novel is supposed to do. Read it.

B007REV4T8|5.0|After the Quantum of Solace mess, James Bond scores with Skyfall.  Here's why:<br /><br />1. Better villain - Javier Bardem is a great actor.  His performance may have been a little bit over the top, but he was a big improvement over Dominic Greene (Quantum of Solace villain).<br /><br />2. The locales were stunning.  Brilliantly filmed.<br /><br />3. Great action sequences.<br /><br />4. Different type of Bond film.  Very unique style.  Does not rely heavily on gadgets.<br /><br />I got hooked on the Bond films back in the early 1980's.  Home Box Office (HBO) would air a Bond film once a month.  This was before For Your Eyes Only came out.<br /><br />Connery was definitely the best, but Craig comes in a close second.<br /><br />Skyfall definitely ranks as one of the top 10 Bond films.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love this CD, but am nevertheless slightly disappointed.<br /><br />The style of music is very beautiful.  One cool thing about Susan is that she's only a few years younger than I am -- and maybe we have sort of similar personalities.  Our tastes in music are similar.  As a result, I like what she chooses to sing and the arrangements that go with those songs.  I am really coming to trust her musical judgment implicitly.<br /><br />Susan has, as everyone knows, a beautiful and expressive voice.  That is quite evident throughout most of the CD.<br /><br />Still, I have to say that I have not heard any recordings quite like that first CD.  The richness and power just aren't there.  I don't know if it's age or whether she has strained her voice or what, but it's just not the same -- alas.  I find the belted notes in \\"This is the moment\\" regrettably thin and whiny sounding.<br /><br />Donny Osmond is a great surprise -- and gives totally amazing performances on two songs.  Susan just showed excellent taste in choosing him as a duet partner.  Donny has been a bit low profile in recent years, working, as I understand it, mostly in Vegas, where we don't hear him unless we go to hear him personally.  He shows in these recordings that he really still packs a punch.  He deserves more public attention.<br /><br />Michael Crawford does a good job as well, but is not quite so awesome as Donny.

030746363X|5.0|I read this book last year, and it was a life changer for me. I haven't implemented all of the chapters in the 4HB, but I have tried many (Slow Carb Diet, some of the exercise routines, and boosting testosterone). Each chapter is great entertainment, and I actually enjoyed reading this book (unlike many other diet, self-help, etc). The way the 4HB is laid out is perfect, I love that Tim organized it in a non-linear way and actually encourages his readers to jump around and skip sections that might be boring (I personally love the geeky science stuff, so I read every single word in the book). This really helps for people who can't stand reading cover to cover and having to go through boring parts that don't apply to them. And who said all books should be linear anyways?<br /><br />So why is this book a life changer for me? I learned one incredibly important lesson: life is an experiment, and if you give it a goodhearted effort if the results don't show, throw it out. Too many times people fail diets because they feel like they have to stick with it for the rest of their life, and then feel incredible guilt for cheating or quitting the diet. If the diet isn't working and you are following it to a \\"T\\" then stop! Find something else! The last thing I learned was to document and test. If you want to figure out why you aren't going up in your lifts or cutting minutes off your 5k time, then you need to go to the records and figure out what's wrong.<br /><br />This book is a great lesson that it is important to challenge the status quo and find out for yourself if the shoe fits. Do we really need that much dairy in our diet? What about grains? Can we live a healthy life without spending 6 hours a week in a gym or running an hour a day for the rest of our lives? Everyone is different, so it's time to get to work and find out for yourself.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|expected more of ridley scott... cgi was awesome, story lacked substance if it was supposed to be a lead in to the \\"alien\\" set... fun to watch, not a well thought out plot.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The characters just get better as time goes along. Leaner, harder, survivors. At this point I think they are becoming barely sane.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|It is scary to think that the people and agencies tasked with keeping us safe may actually be this screwed up. The story has credibility and the acting and production are very well done. I was personally put off by the gratuitous sex and language. It will be interesting to see how this story evolves. (Spoiler Alert!) Will Carrie fade from the story now that she has been outed as a mental patient? What will become of Brody as he continues to be doubted yet recruited by all sides? Will, as I hope, Dana become interested in a life with Homeland Security and take her experiences as Brody's daughter into the agency with her? As with many great series, it took the first season to lay the foundation. Lets see what they can build going forward.
B0088TG252|4.0|A tale of twists and heros and patriots or not. I liked this movie. I'd watch it again. Recommended to you.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|Got the dvd today and enjoyed watching it.I was somewhat disapointed that they cut more than half the concert out,but the tracks that were there were great.Hoping here that at some point there will be a realease of the entire show.But half is better than none.
B00846TRHY|4.0|It doesn't seem to matter to me what role he takes, I simply love watching Gerard Butler strut his stuff on the screen.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|It's like describing Meshuggah, you can't. Eventually you just have to tell someone to listen and decide. I have decided that this album is ridiculously good. It is a beautiful, flowing Deftones release. They keep hitting that signature groove and they just keep getting better.
B008JH5FZ6|3.0|Action. Adventure. Exploration. No really weird twists or crazy-ass characters. Heros and villains...what's not to love? If you want to get what you are looking for and have it for sure, watch this.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I'm a huge directioner and I wanted to get One Direction pictures on my kindle. When you save pictures from tootle and picsart and others it is saved in your gallery. I love this app and One Direction
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter is vigilantism at its best. Dexter claims to feel nothing, but beneath is a simmering passion we all understand.
B001NLKT60|3.0|This second book in the trilogy seems to be less inspired than the first. The book reads somewhat ponderously, one almost gets the feeling the author didn't really want to write it but had made a commitment so slogged through his snow filled drive to the end. It isn't that it is a bad book, it just isn't a great book. I'd say it was adequate for an air-plane read but probably wouldn't consider buying it in print. I'd suggest you check it out at the library and then you won't feel bad about spending more money on a book than it is worth.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Can't bear to think this is the last season. So tasty. So fresh. Wonderfully written and acted. Character driven and proud of it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book! Hard to put down. Believe the hype. Much better than the Twillight series. A truly unique concept which seems difficult to find these days.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Falling skies doesn't develop the characters enough for me. I don't feel their angst. I don't love them or hate them. They just walk around. Maybe they wandered off the set of Walking Dead. I just don't know who they are or where they came from.
B00471TLZS|4.0|Not as scary as it was when it first came out and I was a kid, but still well worth a rewatch.
B00846REIS|3.0|This first installment took a while to keep me interested. The second book made getting through this one totally worth it.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and even had a stuffed Gizmo that I slept with.  Although he wasn't as cute as I remember him I still wouldn't mind having one as a pet... ok only the sweet little gizmo.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This by far is my most favorite films ever made. I could watch these movies again and again without getting sick of them!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun but not as fun as the original virtual city. the money does not grow as fast and everything costs more. you have to have patience if you don't want to spend money.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is fun to play it is very challenging. I always wondered when will the board end. I would love to play this game everyday so that I can get better at it. I just love this game very much.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|the graphics were really outstanding ...there was a good variety of puzzlees...I liked the fact that I<br />could turn the timer off when I needed a little more time.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Very interesting story, I've never read anything like it. Opens up a whole new world that we don't realize exists. Now I'm wondering if it does actually exist in the real world. I think it probably does.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|this was a great story . it started slow with background and imagry then it took off with action and a unexpected ending ....i loved it
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I am very greatful that someone took the time to do the reseach and expose the FDA.  Many of us assume the FDA is there to protect us.  As consumers, we must demand that they do.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Incredible album--not a song on here that I did not like. Actual music with depth that speaks to the soul.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have this app on my phone and I love it. but its to small. so I got it on my kindle .... love it
B008J34466|1.0|There's really not much to say about this album but that is sounds like a bratty, 11-year old tomboyish girl from the gutter that can't help but swear and scream uncontrollably. I know Pink has more soul and depth to her, it's just not shown on here.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book very enlightening and well written. The author is a surgeon who experienced a health episode that should, by all medical accounts, have been fatal.  There are no medical explanations for why he did not succumb and how he could have \\"awakened\\" without permanent brain damage.  His account of what he was experiencing during the days of coma that he endured is fascinating and yet totally believable.  In my opinion, his decision to write about his journey before researching what others have written on the subject makes this book even more authentic.  For readers who have had a near-death experience or who have read about others' experiences, this book will be somewhat familiar but I found that it goes beyond anything I have previously read in both depth and vibrancy.  Excellent book that left me feeling good about the afterlife.
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|I was lucky in receiving a copy that sounded excellent. It is one of my favorite albums by the Beatles and perhaps I have owned a copy of this in every format imaginable. 4 track, 8 track, mono LP, stereo LP, cassette, first issued CD(2)copies,remastered CD, etc. etc.<br /><br /> There was no way I was \\"not\\" going to get a copy of this. For the record, I do own an American pressing (Apple) and a British Parlophone from the box set issued in the late seventies. I did own an original Parlophone from the 1960's, but it was too worn for any reasonable comparison. The American version I like for the aborted beginning on \\"I'm looking through you\\" and it also sound pretty good. The British version definitely sounds better than the american but a tad different from the re-issue. To say one is better, is subjective and \\"apples and oranges\\" to me<br /><br />Analog sound has it's strengths and weaknesses as does some digital remasters. Digital sound is much better than that of the past and it really boils down to who is the engineer on the project. Despite the pressing problems, I do think they have done a nice job on these.<br /><br />What is really exciting to me, is that this event has got all the \\"diehard fans\\" excited again. One thing we all have in common is that we love this band and can never get enough of them. Hopefully, they will work all the pressing problems out and when and if the issue the mono versions, they will learn from this and not repeat the same mistakes.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The author has many interesting facts concerning the negative effect of wheat on a person's diet.  However, he does not stay on track.  He takes on the discussion of sugar levels in all foods.  He should have tackled that subject in another book.  I was very encouraged about eliminating wheat from my diet.  After he took on foods that do not contain wheat, he lost my interest and enthusiasm.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|A great, guilty pleasure.  Warm fire, pot of tea, and a few hours of careless escape.  Chick-flick fare with some quick-witted dialogue.  This first season is probably the best of the five.
B009LL4LMM|3.0|I have enjoyed this game because no time rush. Also makes you do some thinking and reasoning.Great way to pass some time.
B009NOVCSS|3.0|Though the music is quantitative and all remastered, this was a chance for the Stones to release some of the early music in True Stereo. This did not happen! \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"Get Off of my Cloud\\", \\"As Tears Go By\\", \\"Mother's Little Helper\\", \\"Have You Seen your Mother Baby Standing in the Shadows\\", and \\"The Last Time\\" are still in Mono. What a shame as Stereo versions do exist on bootlegs. Oh well, the large book is \\"OK\\" and yet almost sophomoric when compared to \\"Rolling with the Stones\\" by Bill Wyman. For the money, I expected more but was left wanting more.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I didn't even mean to buy it. But after I accidently bought it I decided to play it for the heck of it. I really wish I hadn't done that because it is a really sucky game. Now im mad because 1. I just wasted my money and 2. this game sucks. And I only rated one star because it wouldn't let me not rate it. I want my money back. DON'T BUY IT, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Big build up and disappointing end. Kay, Benton and Lucy have all become cardboard characters, so perfect, smart and lacking depth.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Cheaply made, and it broke within about a week. I give it 3 stars because I should have taken a bit more care, but nonetheless, it broke easily.
0547884591|5.0|This is one of my favorite reference books of all time. Epic, beautiful and incredibly fun.  Each page is a delightful collection of great photos, useful information, and unexpected ideas.
B003O86FMW|5.0|couldn't put it down!! Collins had me sold from the beginning, wonderfully written :) such an amazing story of defiance.
B001R0LOES|4.0|If you want a better understanding of the treaty negotiations you owe it to yourself to get a copy of The Treaty, a superbly acted film available at generalmichaelcollins.com. I just finished watching it and it gave me a much greater appreciation of how difficult it was for Collins who didn't want a return to war.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This is a classic throwback to all the 80s and 90s action movies. A total compilation of all the scenes and actors you could hope for. The acting...come on now...what in the world do you expect? These guys are freakin' fighters...not Broadway. Bloodiest first 5 minutes of any movie ever...even more than Hot Shots Part Deux. Haha. Hands down the best $3.99 you can spend...other than a gallon of milk...sorry sweetie.
B003JJA59K|5.0|I like good books but they don't necessarily make good movies. This was an example of a good book and a good movie. If you want to actually feel something then watch this film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addictive. Easy. Fun. You can't beat angry birds. Got a few minutes to kill? Then play angry birds! Anyone can enjoy this game and you can't beat free.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Between my daughter and I this game gets alot of play time! Very few glitch issues, and we really like it!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thought this was such a refreshing book.  I am still thinking about it and I finished it a few weeks ago.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|nice easy game to play. good challenge and great graphics. good way to pass the time and fun for all ages.
B009A9EQL6|5.0|I don't understand the attitude of some people to try to put their hate on this album, we are in the 21st century, here, you can listen to the whole album, whether the RollingStone.Com full songs or previews on Amazon, before you buy, then WHY BUY AN ALBUM THAT YOU DON'T LIKE, and then complain about that. I have news for you, since you buy the album, on the way to your house the songs will not change and gonna be the same as in the preview. Amazon is not a music critic site, if you have nothing to say about the quality of materials or services received, then you do not have to complain about the music you buy ...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think that this game is really fun and has the perfect amount of challenge and recreational values. Adults and kids would both enjoy it.
1589944607|5.0|I don't consider myself a hardcore gamer with either video or board games.<br />I do enjoy casual gaming, but what sets me apart is that I would rather set up and play a four hour game than play a twenty to thirty minute Euro-Style card game.<br /><br />That said, this game WILL take at least three or four hours to play once everyone is familiar with the rules and the characters and the board. I'll reiterate the familiar part.  The best way to become familiar with the rules, characters and board is to do one practice round before actually starting.  If this is your first time playing, the practice round will probably take an hour.  You may want to take a break between the practice round and restarting the game.<br /><br />I play games with my wife and another married couple.  What usually happens with longer board games is two people will get the game set up and refresh themselves on the rules (or learn them if it is the first time playing the game).  While this takes place the other two will get dinner ready.  If the complexity of the rules requires a practice round, dinner waits for everyone to take the practice round.  After the practice round we eat dinner and then play.<br /><br />As I said, I'm more of a casual gamer. I really don't care if I win or lose because I play for the camaraderie. If you are a sensitive person, you may not like this game because it has the potential to allow players to be ruthless.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />One player can sabotage the others. One player can find out that they are a Cylon and still help the humans, where on the other hand, one player could be helping the Cylons all along and turn out to be 100% human.  Reading this sentence, you will realize how accurate this is from watching the show.<br /><br />***END POSSIBLE SPOILER***<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because you can unlock many different games and they are all super fun! Get this game- it's awesome!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|You feel as if you are living all the trama and fear along with the families.  Looking forward to book 3 !!
B00A7ZXDLQ|2.0|I love Rihanna but this was just.... Different. I really was upset with it. I didn't really like Diamonds, but it grew on me, but this CD most likely won't. It isn't the caliber her other ones have been. She does have a dubstep type song, I wouldn't consider it real dubstep, its pretty neutral probably for those that aren't keen on it... But usually she has a good dance song or two, I'd say those are missing....<br /><br />I'm not sure, but this CD just doesn't scream Rihanna to me. Maybe they're remolding her?
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I got a printed copy months ago, but as I use it a lot at work the electronic version is more convenient.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is phenomenal. Ill never go back from 7.1 Surround sound. All the things it does is amazing for a microphone. The best part is it meets standards of the highest end headsets while being wireless. Don't wait on a sale- Get it now
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use evernote on my phone, macbook pro, and kindle fire. It's a convenient way to take detailed notes on the go and find all of them in one place later.
B009O2XY12|3.0|it wont let me progress to the next level. no matter how many times I complete level one it wont let me go to level 2. its very fun, I want to keep playing!!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Another cracker from Follet<br />Follows the progress of the families introduced in \\"Fall of Giants\\" making a believable history of the turbulant times around the first and second world wars.<br />Look forward to the hinted third volume of this trilogy.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|I liked last years series, spooky and kept it interesting. This year they went wacko with the writing. It is disgusting and downright gross. Glad I didn't purchase the whole season! I love suspense, but not the sadistic torture, it lost the story line & focuses on cutting people up for fun. Really sad that this show has 5 star comments.  I cant watch people abusing, torturing & cutting their limbs off people. It's sick & very disturbing!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|love the brits! English actors seem to bring something just really great when they are in a role, esp when they keep their accent, and there is more than one.  This feel good film, a term someone else used, which is a great way to describe this movie. Don't view it as its going to be a boring movie with a bunch of older people... because it's definitely not that at all. They are very relatable to any age, and shows us that despite your age, we are all struggling and dealing with the same issues of life... of acceptance with ourselves, with our peers, and with people that we love... or are supposed to love..<br /><br />It's about realization and how at any age, it's never too old to start something new, even if its in a entirely different country.  Lots of laughs, lots of very smart quotes from the writers that make you think, really enjoyed this one !
B007GCY8FS|5.0|loved this book an have really enjoyed all the books i have received from Amazon for my Kindel.AMAZON seems to know the kind of book I like and lets me choose from a great sellecton.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|About half-way through this film, I realized that I was completely and utterly enamored.  Four days later, and I'm still entranced.  It was the extended trailer that first caught my attention, and I remember thinking that there was no way the movie itself would measure up.  This is one of those trailers made to sell a sub-standard movie, I thought.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer have crafted one of the most ambitious films I've seen in years, and it works.  I'm sure that critics will bestow the title of \\"best film of the year\\" to something else, but I suspect that Cloud Atlas will be my personal favorite.  Highly recommended.  It's a shame that more people didn't see it.
B000OYC3J8|1.0|This is supposed to be a new CD. There is no plastic packaging and the CD case is cracked. It is a badly used CD not a new one. This CD could be damaged.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Our family loved this game. My son is the big Legos fan. However, we all love playing it together. It's like Pictionary just with a Legos theme. Great for family night!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this book although I was skeptical since it was in the \\"youth\\" \\"young adult\\" section.  Ms. Clare did a wonderful job developing the characters. I appreciate that she did not follow only one of the characters but various through out the series. I hope the movie is fairly accurate because it will be disappointing and seriously annoying if they stray from the book.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We saw this in the theatre and absolutely loved it! It was a movie both my son and daughter enjoyed. Lots of great humor and action. All of the characters were wonderfully created! I highly recommend it for your movie library. : )
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Bought the book because i was waiting forever to get from the library.  Was a fast read, an interesting turn in the story.  And steamy!
B009VB97EY|1.0|NASTY,NASTY,INDECENT,VULGER,NASTY MOUTH,I WOULD NOT HAVE<br />WATCHED IT IF I HAD KNOWN,MOVIES NEED TO BE FIXED SO YOU<br />CAN MAKE A CHOICE IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE NASTY MOUTH.WORDS
0307593525|5.0|Julia Child's knowledge in the kitchen shines through in both these books. I've yet to dislike a recipe I have followed in her books! These cookbooks truly are a must-have for any aspiring chef. Nice quality books as well. If I had to list a negative thing, its that its difficult to know which book to use to look up information so I end up searching both. It looks like volume 1 was written without a clear line between what will be in the future volume 2, and its often a more detailed expansion on a topic covered in volume 1. You also can't search (I dont think so anyway) in the index by meal type for ideas (breakfast, lunch, dinner etc) but only by the major type of food itself. But they are still very good books and I am very pleased to have them!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Wished it had a little more action in the excursion prior to the main mission. Wished the body was pictured so that I could use as a target
B00785P2QC|5.0|entertaining. and exactly. what I was looking for. game works great. only complaint I have, would be that it's hard to place items in the corner of the map due to the in game icons.
