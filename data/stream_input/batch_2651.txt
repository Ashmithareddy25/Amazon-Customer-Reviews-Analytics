B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game. I am a mahjong fan and this game is really fun. I wish it had more levels though.
0812550706|5.0|First time reader of the Card sci-fy series and I loved this book.  I'm interested to see how they do the movie coming up in November!
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I had a few problems with loading on this, and I didn't really like it. I am going to sick with the original video player on my kindle.
B008C20TDG|5.0|The best life style change and sustainable change I have been a part of.  I feel 100% better, my weight is down, and my blood pressure is on the verge of being normal.  Easy read full of information.
0525952926|5.0|This book taught me more about world war than I learned in school.  Anyone liking history and Ken Follett's trilogy will love this book. It's a story within itself so you do not have to read in order released which is often the case with a trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Two in family read this book. We both could not put it down til the last page was read, we are ready for book two.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game was fine but just as I was about to get rarity the game uninstalled itself and forced me to restart and  it continues to restart this game is good but busted I wouldn't  waste my  time with downloading it
1451695195|4.0|Finally, something written by a neurosurgeon who can explain to other physicians and the public why his experience was not based on brain chemicals, reactions from memories etc.  It really did happen.  Of course, there are still going to be the nay-sayers.<br />I gave it four stars because I wished that he would have/could have explained what that primordial goop was!  I've never read anything even close to this description of the afterlife and I wonder if it was because so many of his circuits were closed down.<br />I also wish that he would have explained why - if we are all part of God and we are perfect - do we have to come here and struggle for perfection?  I mean, what IS the point of coming to this planet?
1400069289|5.0|Recently purchased The Power of Habit, and it is filled with interesting information about why we form the habits we do, and gives examples of how individuals were able to literally re-wire their brains by changing habits.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.
1401937519|5.0|I love to read these kinds of books and I'm always interested in a new perspective.  I didn't think it was very well written, however and wonder how much editing took place.<br />Regardless, I am so happy that Anita lived to tell her story and so sad that she had to endure so much pain.
0439023521|5.0|Book is great! Everyone should read it if they haven't gotten a chance. Nothing like the movie. Love both movie and book!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Well written, reads like a real historical narrative with multiple points of view.<br />Allows a reader with imagination to paint a vivid picture for themselves without being too<br />wordy or long winded.<br />The characters are likeable regular people, whose only real connection to each other is<br />they survived. Although not unscathed due to the length and nature of the war.<br />The characters range from Politicians to Soldiers and Civilians from regions across the globe.<br />If you like history real or imagined this is a novel for you.<br />But be aware there is plenty of \\"adult language\\" in this book and I would not recommend it for children under 16 years of age.
B007SGM084|5.0|Ordered this on kindle and read it on my HTC and iPhone. After reading the preview I didn;t think I was really going to like the series. After urging from friends I was pleasantly surprised. A quick interesting read!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well first off, :) :) :) :) :) i absolutely love my horse! Its a fun game for the mind and helps you if you actually have a horse by teaching you the responsibilities of owning one. Personally i love horses and ride them frequently. That's why i was excited when this came out. So if your looking for an opinion, take mine and get this game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had fun challenging my children. At nine and seven they really enjoyed it. Can't wait to play more levels and more challenges.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I purchased this because I could not get my Kindle to charge. After I received this I found out it was the device so not sure how this would have worked.
B000I9VON0|4.0|The actor did a great job when the movie came ou the technology was spot on. Good movie to watch for date night
0156528207|5.0|When Summer arrived in 1987, my cousin Gerry brought her two boys Chris and Justin to the Big Apple from Oregon for the weekend before visiting their grandparents in CT. After we had an early breakfast, the temperature continued to rise and there were distinct creaking sounds from the old A/C in the living-room. 'We could visit the Museum of Natural History', I suggested weakly, knowing that the family crowds were going to be staggering. Justin who was seven at the time shouted enthusiastically: 'I want to see the dinosaurs!', and Chris now nine added solemnly: 'The Planetarium', so there was no turning back. Their mother smiled and added 'Well, I've always thought it would be nice to see the butterflies in the Conservatory. Let me a take a quick shower, make a few calls, and the boys can play one of their board games before we leave'. Glancing at my husband, I saw that he had his plans mapped out for the day and was off to compose a song on the piano. He already was on another planet.<br /><br />Chris was ensconced in some cartoon magazines while Justin, looking animated, announced: 'I won a prize for my drawing at school. Would you like to see it?'. 'Of course', I replied. One never knows what one is going to discover from these young artists, and his award for an imaginative snail with a green shell was reminiscent of a watercolor by St. Exup&eacute;ry, the author of \\"The Little Prince\\" (1943). When I mentioned this to him, adding that the creator of the above was also a brilliant aviator and a hero, he was pleased. As for the author's classic story, I remembered that I would not fully appreciate it until much later in life.<br /><br />The story might begin as follows: 'Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived by himself on a tiny planet', or perhaps another beginning might be: 'A pilot, the narrator of this story, once was flying at night when his small plane had engine difficulties and he had to make an emergency landing in the Saharan Desert. He felt more shipwrecked than a sailor at sea, and without the help of a mechanic, he set about alone making repairs to the engine. It was a question of survival, and he had barely enough water to last a week. After the first night, he was awoken at sunrise by a little voice saying: 'please draw a small sheep for me'. He jumped to his feet in astonishment, and there standing looking seriously at him was an extraordinary little boy, quite composed and not at all lost or thirsty, one thousand miles away from any human habitat.<br /><br />After regaining his voice, the pilot asked the child for an explanation, but the boy not to be deterred, kept asking for a drawing of a sheep. Finally the narrator did this with difficulty because when he was very young about the same age as the boy, grown-ups didn't understand his drawings until he finally set these aside, and decided to become an aviator when he was older. But it was to make him feel lonely early in life.<br /><br />During the next eight days, the boy never answered his questions directly, but only asked the pilot many ones instead, and it was by listening to him very carefully indeed that the narrator was able to tell us the story of this young visitor, whom he called 'The Little Prince'.<br /><br />By the little prince's account, he had left his small planet, the size of a large house, because his heart hurt for the love of a proud flower, a Rose, the only one he had ever seen, and he decided to explore some other planets. He was not sure yet whether he would return to her, and his own planet one day. On his travels through the starry skies, he was to meet solitary souls in the form of a King, a Conceited Man, a Tippler, a Businessman, and a Lamp Lighter. With the exception of the latter, he found them all very odd, and thought that grown-ups were strange with their claims of being interested only in 'matters of consequence'. Eventually a Geographer seated behind his desk alone on his planet, advised him to visit Earthfor its 'good reputation'.<br /><br />When the little prince had come across the pilot, it has been a long journey and he had met with a bed of Roses, a Fox, a Railway Switcher and a Merchant (the fox was disappointed to learn that there were no chickens on the prince's planet although there were no hunters either, but then nothing is ever quite perfect in life). The little prince went on to relay to the narrator, whom he was now friends with, everything that he had been told on his visits, including an important secret that the Fox was to offer him as a parting gift.<br /><br />As for the end of this famous story, you will have to decide whether you wish to read it, or not. It is possibly the only fable that contains every emotion in life whether it be that of friendship, love, worry, laughter, courage, fear, happiness, sadness, or really what matters to you most when you think about it. We are all different in that way, and our personal interpretations are many and varied.<br /><br />If you choose, however, to read \\"The Little Prince\\", the narrator has only one request to make of us: should any of you find yourselves under a solitary star one night, please wait a moment, and should you happen to see a little boy with golden hair who laughs and refuses to answer questions, please comfort the narrator and send word that he has come back.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />This one for Pat who travels the skies around the world and understands many things, especially books about children, and now at a grown-up age, this friend of mine remembers what it was to be a child while continuing to enjoy the happiness of water among many other essential things.ts 'good reputation'.<br /><br />When the little prince had come across the pilot, it has been a long journey and he had met with a bed of Roses, a Fox, a Railway Switcher and a Merchant (the fox was disappointed to learn that there were no chickens on the prince's planet although there were no hunters either, but then nothing is ever quite perfect in life).

B001KZG99A|4.0|We thought we ought to start with the first of the series. I adore Robert Downey, Jr. - an absolutely brilliant actor - but they didn't give him much to work with here. A lot of action of course and the special effects were good but the script, not so much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is good for any at any age. My three year old son likes it. I hope you family will like the game as much as my family does. Good luck on solving the puzzles.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Lovely movie. I'd seen it with my daughter but wanted to share it with my husband - I knew he'd love it. Wonderful story, excellent script, the best character actors and amazing scenery. I know we'll watch it again...
B0091REZMW|5.0|a very enjoyable game. I like that it isn't timed. very relaxing and addictive. I am a fan of mystery so inthought I would try this game. very cool.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The current format for this app. is great!  I can get an overview of conditions plus any specific information I need in seconds.  The info is laid out simply and logically, and it is displayed in large print that is quickly legible even on the smallest of screens.  The graphics are  bright and clear, as well as easy to interpret.  They are very helpful when I am driving across state.  This is a keeper, and is now my everyday weather app.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is recommended for people who like Battlefield or Call of Duty. The game might take a lot of space, but it is definitely worth it. The update worked for me. All I had to do is to go to the amazon app store, find the Modern Combat Four app, tap on it, and click or tap on the button that said update.
0439023521|5.0|I honestly cannot believe the popularity of a book that is centered around a competition where children kill each other for sport.  But, the popularity of this novel speaks for itself.  You root for the heroes & jeer the villains.  You pray for a change in the government & imagine yourself in this world.<br /><br />The content of this novel is disturbing but you are somehow able to suspend your judgement & concepts of reality while reading this book.<br /><br />After reading this book I wanted my husband to read it as well.  When he claimed he wasn't interested I actually read it to him!  He loved it so much we would stay up at night reading it!  It's impossible to put down once the real action begins!
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|This is the second Saitek quadrant I have purchased so that I can set up for twin engine operation.<br />It is a great quadrant that can easily be modified to have custom levers, which I made out of 1&#34; aluminum flat bar and wood dowel for the knobs.<br /><br />I also like that there are three programmable switches on the bottom.
0375431624|4.0|I needed to purchase two large print books for the Angel Tree at church.  They were so hard to find!  I had no idea.  I ordered several of these large print books as gifts.  John Grisham is a good, popular author so I hope these gifts were enjoyed by their recipients.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game it is awesome it's just like GTA. I have loved this game ever since I bought it. Although I would not recommend it for little kids.
0439023491|4.0|I couldn't put down The Hunger Games so I was excited to read this second book.  It didn't disappoint!  The action & excitement are still as captivating as in the original book!<br /><br />However, much of this book is quite similar to the first.  The heroine finds herself in very similar situation as in the first book.  Again the plot has a twist that allows both protagonists to survive the slaughter of The Arena.<br /><br />I would have liked a story line that was differentiated from the first novel, but this book is still thrilling, addictive, & fulfilling.  You won't regret reading it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This definitely goes down as one of my all time favorites in any genre of literature. It was the perfect blend of joy, pain, love, struggle, humor, and just life. Great love story and I cannot wait til the 9th to get book #2 . Thank God I put off reading this one for so long because if I had to wait months like everyone else I'd pull my hair out lol. I recommend this book wholeheartedly. I take my hat off to colleen hoover.
0439023513|4.0|I am a huge fan of this trilogy & thoroughly enjoyed Suzanne Collins' writing.  The books were exciting, intense, suspenseful, & addicting.<br /><br />However, this book concentrates so heavily on the political life of Panem that much of the excitement of the first 2 books is lost.  I was unable to get as excited or passionate about this story line as in the first two books.<br /><br />This book nicely wraps up the series & finally answers the question of who gets the girl.  Not everything is wrapped into a pretty package with a bow.  There are painful endings to the story lines of several characters.<br /><br />All in all, this novel helps to achieve resolution for the story line of this intensely popular & addictive series.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|While I enjoyed the story line the lack of an editor seriously impacted my enjoyment of this novel. The author seems to be writing at a 8th grade level with short sentences, lack of a complex vocabulary and many spelling and grammar errors, so I am not sure how it can get so many 5 star reviews. Because this is their first novel I am willing to give the next one a try in hopes that it gets better.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son loves this game. We happen to just stumble across it. Keeps him entertained! I would recommend it to my friends and family.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|MINI REVIEW: a bold movie that delivers on music and special effects and the big questions facing humanity but the plotting is clunky and some of the characters are off. At certain points you'll be confused as to what is transpiring but don't worry that's 99% of the rest of the audience. Great for Sci-Fi fans even if it's flawed but probably best to skip for all other types. OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B (a lot less for non SciFi fans).
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy this game to help me unwind from a stressful day. It is fun and not hard at all. You just need to pay attention to what you are doing!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the most coolest game could play. It's epic cause it's challenging, fun, and last but not least EPIC!!!!!!!<br /><br />YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY GET THE GAME!!!!!!!!
0312370849|5.0|This was a great book.  The characters were believable and the fleshing out of the storyline was very well done.  Would recommend this author, in fact I've already purchased another of her books.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The book really didn't get started for me until well over half way.  I am glad I persevered though because it became very exciting.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It automatically opens every time you recharge th battery. Good indication of battery charge. I'd recommend it to my friends.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|While the CGI/special effects was pretty good, story wise it was mediocre. The trailer for the movie was actually more exciting than watching the movie itself.  I rented it on Amazon and I don't regret it, but I expected better.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is like Mary Poppins in that it's &quot;practically perfect in every way.&quot; A lot of fun, good story, and with just the right degree of difficulty. Definitely worth the money.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Just as described, bought to go with the accelerated charging hub and works great. Would recommend to anyone who needs a extra cable.
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|After all the media and publicity of this new album and judging by their past albums everyone was pretty excited for the release of a new album by Daft Punk.  Well...  it's nothing at all like any of the other Daft Punk albums, This is more like a whole CD of disco
0740797719|5.0|James Gurney is a very practiced and accomplished artist, and in this books he shares many insights and practical tips on painting. I found it helpful and encouraging.
B0035YDM4Y|4.0|I read this book because it was written by Patrick Robinson - and if he could take the time an effort to write about such a situation (of which the world has seen more than enough!), then there must be not only a \\"good story\\" in it, but a \\"personal angle\\" that shows something new or at least little known to the general public.<br /><br />This is a book is not just about the courage and honour of the military (even - or especially those of the \\"special forces\\") but also two other groups of people often forgotten - or rarely mentioned; The family and friends \\"left behind\\" and the \\"would be enemy\\" - in this case those Afgan villagers who were not only prepared to give thier lives to protect an \\"outsider\\" - a would be aggressor, but as the writer clearly shows, have set thier decendents against merciless opponents - probably forever...<br /><br />Clearly Marcus Luttrell fully appreciated not only the sacrifices made for him by his comrades and family, but even more so; those made in Afganistan by village people (living a very hard life), who in truth owed him no loyalty at all - but were honour bound to protect and help him at risk of thier own and thier families lives. Marcus - I hope you fulfill your dream; become a doctor and help save lives - as others saved yours!!
1419705849|4.0|My son who is 11 y/p said that he enjoyed this book very much though it was not his favorite.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game! Not too hard but gets your brain working. Requires a little bit of memory and strategy. definitely recommend!
0439023483|4.0|My son has The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set, however he lost this book 1 in school.<br />He really liked it a lot, so we decided to get him one again.<br />He re read over and over again...
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|this was Not a very good movie.  would be one star if not for what i wrote in title.  too bad.  so much potential.
1419702238|3.0|He said that this was not as good as other Dairy of a Wimpy kid book but he still enjoyed it.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My grandkids love ths movie. It has quite a few reasons why everyone an be interested, even adults. It is very colorful and really seemed to grab toddlers attention.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I really like this game... I wish there was more to it, after getting to thirty multiplier you don't really have a goal to fulfill. Also its really irritating that the game will save your high score with facebook but not your characters, boards, gold, keys, or accomplishments. And once or twice it uninstalled itself and deleted all the game data so I had to start over again, Ive had to start over at least 10 times. They really need to make it so it saves the entire game to your facebook account, or email or whatever.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love this game! It is so much fun and I never stop playing it! I advise everyone to at it!
B00821OX98|5.0|Thank you Amazon!  I was able to catch up on all the lost episodes.  Now I have to sit around and wait a week for the next one!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Whilst this is certainly no &#34;Kite Runner&#34;, it was still well-crafted with a good story-line.  I was particularly impressed with how he handled the times in Europe, but by far, he shines best when wrigting about his home country.  Well worth a read.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|this is the first paid app I ever bought and it is the best ten bucks I ever spent on magic the gathering.
B003V4ASV8|3.0|It certainly captures the horror of life in North Korea and how out of step they are with the rest of the World;  not unlike Cuba in some ways, but more isolated. The idea of that level of isolation and of the totalitarian control of an entire populace echoes of what we always thought of life behind the Iron Curtain. This of course turned out to be true once the curtain was lifted.  Although it was written in English, the language is quite stilted - as though it had been translated.
B000AXWV40|5.0|Great album! The use of guitar really blew my mind, the bonus tracks were also much appreciated. A truly great example of psychadelic music
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book was so well written. I have been following the advice and program and I have made amazing progress in a few short months. I am 55 years old and I have not felt this good about myself in a long time.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|The subject matter hit home, as I was a Math major.  All the elements of a good thriller were there but it turned out to be pretty disgusting.  It was like watching a loop over and over.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|If you like Downton Abbey, you'll like this show. Don't expect it to be the same though, they dynamic is a little different. It's a cool insight into the lifestyle at the time though. Enjoy!
B00006JIA4|5.0|I was never a big fan of Queen, but I think that late-Freddie Mercury had an amazing voice. It's is arguably one of best voice in rock.<br />He was also a amazing showman,  The three greatest hits CD, a must have for even a casual fan.  I never own anything my Queen before, but now I have three CD's of all the hits.  Great purchase/
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun keeps me busy love it but sometimes it's hard and I don't know what to do but other than that is great
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy enough to use. Not like what I use with the computer but similar. Since I use my kindle all the time, its made ebay more available.
6305781427|3.0|I have an earlier Yanni CD and like it very much, but I felt that \\"Live at the Acropolis\\" was somewhat pretentious and showy (I know, I know, a concert is supposed to be showy, but I thought this was just too much).<br /><br />It doesn't really matter.  My father-in-law enjoys watching musical performances and this was a gift for him.  As far as that goes, if you enjoy watching a performance, and not just listening to it, you'll probably like this.
1594489505|5.0|I loved reading this book, but I guess I will be needing some eye glasses because I read it in 2 days :)
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Ok, so this story line in general is kinda cheesy but OMG it's good.  Can't put it down and can't wait for the next one!
1452101426|4.0|I really like Disney/Pixar's collection series of these 'The Art of (Insert movie title)' - At first I purchased the Art of Tangled which blew me away with the gorgeous artwork.<br /><br />While this is a nice book I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the art selection. It wasn't as stunning or involved as the work for Tangled.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Loved the movie. Action, funny, and sad parts. It will be a cult flick in time when seen more often.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Easy to use; I find myself playing game after game. The controls are easy to figure out. You will use the undo button some as the game does not always play the cards in the same place you wanted, but that is minor.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its very fun and great for children because it has a lot of activies. It is sure to keep them entertained on long car rides
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Im a life time trekie,....so I will give the movie a solid 9.5 for story and acting.<br /><br />The only thing I found stupid was the appearance of size in the NCC 1701....my first impression was,....Where the hell was this shot ???....in a factory...<br /><br />but....like most early star trek epoisodes,....<br />you gotta cut the budget somewhere,.....obviously....most of the money went to CGI.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am a hidden object junkie. Love this game. Graphics are great. This is the first game I have tried on my kindle but it won't be the last
B00005LK95|5.0|Im a big fan of Short Circuit so I have to give it a 10.<br /><br />Can AI ever achieve sentience???? I doubt it,.....as hard as man tries to enhance technology and fool you into believing its alive...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is intriguing.  After Binge watching Seasons 1 and 2 on Comcast....I had to see Season 3.<br />Enjoyed every minute.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle game. Looking forward to see what they come up with next, both as an extension to this first game, and other things. Great graphics as well. Every days it's too short (it is!) But well worth it.
B00847KFDS|3.0|I like the ne John Fogerty CD but it is not my favorite.  By adding other people to different tracks the CD lost much of it's power.  john does better by himself.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun fun fun!!!<br />Loved playing this game and beating my family to escape first. Makes you think and use logic along with witt
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg voices the profound paradox career-minded women face, how to overcome gender based obstacles to career building.<br />It's an unspoken yet ever present complaint in the workplace that women are somehow less-than if they are trying to maintain a career and motherhood.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I may be a 32 y/o mom, but I love this show.  It reminds me of a cross between Daria and My So Called Life
B008AIGWVA|4.0|It's great for kids and most of all its FREE. It's probably the 3rd best games I've played. It's great
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved it! Started watching the show and was inspired to read the books....glad I did. I look forward to the second one.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|If you love Mahjong then this is the one to get. I've had hours of fun trying to beat the clock. Love it
B00BEXB18M|2.0|This album really is full of great ideas.  In fact i'm not so sure if the songs themselves are all that bad really, but it does feel underwhelming.  I feel a big part of the problem is that every album starting with United Abominations has this annoying, modern sterile production that just chokes all of the balls out the metal moments of this album.  I've seen alot of criticism that this album is more of a rock album than a metal album and i'm not so sure that's true, the riffing on most of the songs certainly is metal, but since all organic life was squeezed out and replaced with a cold, almost computerized sound it's just not a very satisfying album to listen to. I feel like this album was recorded on a reel of tin foil!  I thought ditching Sneap would help, but Thirteen sounded just like Endgame and this is their worst sounding album yet.  (Yes So Far, So Good had terrible production but terrible analog is much more welcoming than terrible digital.)  I think Mustaine himself is to blame and he really needs to stay away from the mixing board and get on board with someone that can heavy it up for him.<br /><br />The second biggest problem is Dave Mustaine just isn't putting any effort into his vocals anymore.  He clearly doesn't have much of a voice left.  Every live clip i've seen is very hit or miss and every album since Endgame he just seems to be talking through it.  This isn't to say Mustaine was ever a great vocalist, but like all \\"non-traditional\\" singers, he had a certain charisma to his vocals and that just isn't there anymore.  Songs like Kingmaker Burn! and Built For War would totally benefit from a much more aggressive singer, in fact these songs would fit in very well on a classic Megadeth release with a much younger Mustaine singing (and probably writing lyrics.)<br /><br />On this plus side, he seems to have toned down his polarizing political lectures, which allows me to want to listen to every single song.  While I'm aware that his entire career since Peace Sells has been full of political lyrics, it certainly isn't the same.  I think Dave realized with this release that it's making many fans, former fans.<br /><br />Everything on this album represents a weaker, half finished and rushed version many of their previous albums.  Better than their previous album, but both this and Thirteen represent the worst stuff Megadeth has ever put out.  Passionless metal produced by a man who clearly doesn't have it in him anymore.  Take a break Dave, you really need it.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|can not enlarge and cannot see images.  this would be a very nice game if you could see what is on the screen not for a kindle size screen
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Good product.  Love the color, convenience and it protects/secures the Kindle thoroughly.  I tend to carry my Kindle with me everywhere and have been pleased with the cover.  Very happy overall with the product.
0440180295|5.0|This book is fantastic. The style in which this book is written is truly unique and captivating. I think this should be required reading in schools. The book does have an anti war approach which some may not like. But everyone should be against war, it is a last resort and should be treated that way. War is a disgusting thing. When it is necessary however, everyone should be supportive of those that are doing the fighting and the dying. You don't have to support the cause but you should support the people making the sacrifice. Sorry, back to the book. It is terrific and I guarantee you will find yourself smiling and laughing out loud several times throughout this book! You might even learn a little bit of history because the bombing of Dresden isn't a very popular subject in American History.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Queensryche self-titled in 2013.  I have followed the saga that got Queensryche to this point since around \\"Dedicated to Chaos\\".  I haven't bought an album of theirs after \\"Promised Land\\" but waited for this one with bated breath for months.  First off, the only potential disappointment for me is the length, obviously.  But I also see it as them trying to get to the point and release an album that has the urgency to keep the listener engaged.  Not a second of this disc is wasted.<br /><br />Todd LaTorre does an admirable job singing on this album.  His singing rang true to the history of this band while putting his own spin on it.  Michael Wilton and Parker Lundgren sounded so in sync in a way that reminds me of the great tandem between Wilton and Chris DeGarmo many years ago.  Eddie Sounded great as usual and Scott (as great as he's been) really took it to the next level with his drumming and writing here.<br /><br />As far as strong moments go, what isn't a strong moment?  When I first listened to \\"Redemption\\" months ago, I knew we would be in for something special.  It reminded me of everything great about this band.  Hearing \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\" and then \\"Fallout\\" only confirmed that.  Listening to the whole album sealed it.  It is a top 5 album of 2013 for sure.  But, if I had to pick a favorite from this album it would be \\"Open Road\\".  Maybe because it evokes the feeling of trying to move forward and start anew, while acknowledging the hopes and the hardships of doing so.  I think we can all relate to that to some degree or another.<br /><br />Anyway, I am glad to have this release.  I wish them luck and want to see them be fully acknowledged as the only true version of Queensryche today.  I also look forward to their next album.  And btw, if anybody from the band sees this, you could make it 10-15 minutes longer.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Basically iTunes for Android. I prefer the music player over the one the phone came with or any that I have downloaded.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I fell in love with Garth Brooks when I lived in Oklahoma in the 90's.  Back then the radio played all Garth all the time.<br /><br />Every now and then I get on a big Garth kick and I check iTunes for his music, but it just doesn't exist digitally.  I had no choice but to purchase this CD.  I'm glad I did.  These songs are like old friends and every time I listen it brings back memories.  Plus, you can't beat the value.  Over 35 songs for $12????<br /><br />Really, just buy the CD already.  You know you want to.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Exceeded my expectations on graphics. It has variety, and is not just a plain easy game. It is a g<br />ood rpg overall.
1476727910|4.0|An alien (specifically, a Vonnadorian) comes to Earth to destroy evidence of a breakthrough made by Andrew Martin, a Cambridge professor of mathematics who proved the Reimann Hypothesis. To accomplish his mission, the alien must assume the unfortunate professor's identity and eliminate the unfortunate people who might know of Martin's discovery, including his wife and son. The alien Martin is equipped with the usual array of alien powers, including the ability to induce heart attacks and to heal blind dogs.<br /><br />The alien's mission gives him a chance to study the odd species with midrange intelligence called humans. The Humans is the alien's account of his experiences on Earth. Like most anthropological examinations of humans through alien eyes, this one is quite funny. Martin ponders the meaning of human life (pursuing \\"the enlightenment of orgasm\\" seem to be \\"the central tenet\\") and draws pointed conclusions about the meaninglessness of most human activities: consumerism, war, sexual embarrassment, bad poetry, the endless need to state the obvious. Oh, and social networking, which \\"generally involved sitting down at a nonsentient computer and typing words about needing a coffee and reading about other people needing a coffee, while forgetting to actually make a coffee.\\" Human concepts are bewildering, particularly delusions like love and free will. \\"Given the absence of mind-reading technology, humans believe monogamy is possible.\\" The alien finds it difficult to distinguish between madness and sanity and is amazed at the human capacity for hypocrisy. The many uses humans find for cows, on the other hand, fascinate him.<br /><br />To some extent, The Humans is a throwback novel, echoing the feel-good message that was common in science fiction of an earlier generation: humans are special, humans are unique, human traits (curiosity, tenacity, empathy, hope) will always assure their survival. The message is slightly tempered by the modern tendency toward realism (or cynicism) but the novel's weakness is the alien's all too quick and all too predictable realization that humans are not primitive beasts but lovable beings standing on the threshold of greatness. At times, the novel is embarrassingly gushy in its praise of humankind (\\"a miraculous achievement\\"). It's also crammed with enough simplistic platitudes to rival a self-help book.<br /><br />A funny story about an alien who reviles humans but is forced to become one is bound to follow a predictable path. The notion of an alien embracing human emotions and beliefs after taking human form isn't new, and the reader suspects that the alien will eventually be a better human than was Martin because that's how these stories work. The human characters also tend to be predictable, including the son who suffers because he can't live up to the standard set by his brilliant father. I appreciated, however, Matt Haig's willingness to make the alien Martin true to himself, and to avoid a contrived ending to the story.<br /><br />I don't entirely buy the notion that by taking human form, an alien who views humans as repulsive would so quickly decide that one of them is lovely, much less embrace human conventions of romance (without, at least initially, having much of a clue about sexual desire). Would an alien raised in an environment of peace, beauty, and immortality really reject the \\"dullness\\" of that life in favor of the pain and loss that characterizes human existence? That notion is the foundation of the plot but Haig didn't convince me to buy into it. The story's predictability and doubtful credibility make The Humans an unsuccessful drama, but the novel works well as a comedy. I would give it 3 stars as a science fiction drama but 5 stars as a science fiction comedy, for a final 4 star rating.m (or cynicism) but the novel's weakness is the alien's all too quick and all too predictable realization that humans are not primitive beasts but lovable beings standing on the threshold of greatness.

0131103628|5.0|I first bought this book over 15 years ago and &#34;loaned&#34; it to a friend in collage.<br /><br />I never forgave him for not returning it.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the best book on C that there ever was.  I wish they had it available in electronic format.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Had I known before I started this last book there would be a 4th and 5th I would've waited to read it. I was anxiously awaiting a conclusion to the story.
B004FQX5CK|4.0|[Primarily a review of the Blu-ray itself]  Wow.  This is by far the most beautiful film transfer I've ever seen.  Ridley Scott says this is his favorite version of the film, and that they did a 4k transfer to digital, then transcoded to Blu Ray.  This means they transferred it at 4 times the resolution of your HD TV.  And it shows.  This may be, especially for us old timers - you know, born before Y2k - the best possible movie format:  film digitally beautified/restored and transferred to digital.  It's wonderful to behold.  One can see the graininess and warmth that film brings.  But with zero distortion and loss that comes from copying film to other media, like VHS.  It's some of the most spectacular film footage you will behold.  Watch it for this reason alone.  I really still cannot believe how utterly beautiful to behold this version is.<br /><br />As for the \\"Final Cut\\" version of the film, it's been a long time since I've seen the theatrical and director's cut versions, but this version seems really good and close to the director's cut I think.  I'm pretty sure there are some new digital FX images put into the film - and though they are technically amazing I thought they were a bit too different from the original film footage.  Not a big deal, but to me feels less organic (can one use that phrase for a sci-fi film?).<br /><br />Kudos to Ridley Scott and whatever powers that be that had the fortitude to make this release.
0142405809|5.0|Both grandsons liked this one.  Great read.  Parent liked it too!!  Grandma will get to have a go soon.  Thank you.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is the number 2 of the Century Trilogy. It is a great combination of history and fiction. Anyone who is interested in what shaped the world in the 20th century and WW2 ought to read the book. Sometimes it gets a little soup opera like but that is the fiction in it. I would recommend to read Fall of Giants first. A very good read as well. Overall, it is a very good book and I am waiting for the third book of the trilogy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such a great show -- great actors, interesting plot lines, well-scripted, beautiful scenery and costumes. Can't wait to see what happens next!
B0085KGHI6|4.0|The Stones were engaged in one of their high powered tours when they had some time off to stop in at Muddy Waters' lounge, to enjoy the work of one of the great blues masters who taught them their licks.  Muddy invites them up to join him onstage, and a superbly loose and intense collaboration ensues.  Muddy, of course, is always in charge, but he gives Keith and Mick plenty of room to work with him and showcase their talents as well.  This DVD completes my collection of Stones' performance videos, at least until the next one comes out.
B000002KDI|5.0|I actually have this in vinyl, but for some reason that is beyond me, never got the CD.  This is great, I get to add the CD to my collection and don't have to rip it.  Very convenient..a two-fer!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|As with season one, a good show, excellent contemporary adaptation of the Holmes oeuvre, and a valuable addition to my collection of Holmes film adaptations. This one is especially treasured here, as it contains both the Hound of the Baskervilles and the Reichenbach Falls tales.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Well, it was the best MI, but I think the story was still a bit 2 dimensional. And it was not believable that the bad guy  could remotely take on physically Ethan.
B004132I20|4.0|Good show, excellent contemporary adaptation of the Holmes oeuvre, and a valuable addition to my collection of Holmes film adaptations.  I want to see Benedict Cumberbatch in a Globe Theatre Shakespeare production.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I have not actually tried the sleep clock, but played with it some.  It looks like it should do very well.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I have been on a paranormal romance binge and honestly I'm burning out. I picked up this series in desperation, and perhaps I was predisposed against it. However, I was so pleasantly surprised by this book and its successor.<br /><br />The background is an intriguing late-1800s London, with a splash of steampunk. I really appreciated the dark atmosphere and social conflict; they made this feel like a fantasy book with romance rather than just a romance novel. Honoria is a great heroine - tough, smart, and believable. The plot is fast and engaging.<br /><br />I think the second book in this series is just as good, and I've preordered the third. That's very rare for me!
0449011917|4.0|I am hooked on the series.  I am not finished with this one yet, hoping it will be as good as the previous books.
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|I had no idea what kind of movie this was supposed to be going in, but I am glad I watched. It's a cult classic, but that didn't prevent a modern giant budget film from ripping off the plot, character, and premise.
1439152802|5.0|She is a new author for me.  I loved this story and it prompted me to buy all her books that she has written so far.<br />Hopefully there will be more.  Good story and lots of mystery.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Salma Hayek gives an excellent performance in this movie. The imagery used in the movie is something worth noted because it really tries to incorporate the art of Frida Kahlo.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is an awesome writer and I read everything he writes.  I have read him for years and enjoyed his books.
1451668945|3.0|Not bad, and definitely better than her last couple of offerings.. for the most part the story engaged me and kept me reading till the end.. but it was sort of predictable in parts, and I felt like the end was really rushed , anti-climatic... just wrapped up too quickly and neatly.. Her stories seems very formulaic to me anymore.. but still not a bad read.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|Useless and worthless and when you perchase its blurry. I really dont like ir so ya pleas e rhymed sig new men Heywood hit hooves.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great for tons of lenses, extra batteries, things that you need but never seem to have room for in those tiny camera bags... also great padding for all of it as well.  Even has a spot on the side for the traveling small or folding tripod.  I also love that its a backpack... can never go wrong with black!<br /><br />Totally would recommend it anyone starting out or who has been in the photography game for a while and your out and about.  Never know when you need those little last minute items!<br /><br />I use it with my Nikon D3200 ... of course I make my husband carry it so I carry my purse usually but its great all the same.
B00821OX98|4.0|The show is entertaining to watch, if you don't try to pick at the holes in the writing. You know a lot of the time I will be watching and think why don't the aliens just call in air support and bomb these guys.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story keeps me entertained each day. I like exploring new islands and meeting new dragons. Sometimes I get mad at the game because of time and stuff but aside that,this game rocks!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's fun, to play it has a strategy to it makes you think a good time passer get it and enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addictive. A good way to kill some time when you are bored could be a little more challenging.  but otherwise a good game.
B0031ESIZQ|4.0|Game works fine, it froze once but I think that was most likely my computer. other than that no complaints.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Susan Boyle's voice is amazing to listen to -- wasn't sure at first if I liked some of her cuts, but they have really grown on me. She is both peaceful and exciting to listen to, almost at the same time. Thanks!
1781162646|5.0|Enjoyable read.  Loved the &#34;coming of age&#34; part of the story.  Not frightening in the normal way of King, however, more realistic fear that normal people face.
630438551X|5.0|my granddaughter was having difficult with Romeo & Juliet in literature and this helped. Lesson learned and so happy to have movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game! I cannot wait until more levels are revealed! The levels are very interactive. I definitely had a difficult time with level 10, I keep missing some small step.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter, she loves Harry Potter and wanted the complete collection. This is a gift she will have forever and can be passed down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a okay game wish there was more levels. that would make this game go to 5 stars and be a lot better.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is a ton of fun, definitely give it a try. Has a nice story and ya  can't beat the price either. Samurai killin zombies...so great.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Tight fit in lighter socket, unlike some others.  Charges my iPhone5 much faster than other products I have tried.  Nice high quality feel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game loads of fun. A great game to pass the time* I rate it 5 stars plenty of updates to keep the game fun
B0059WTMLW|3.0|Marvellous to stimulate the brain when we do not have anything more to do. Advise for all ages above 6.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|This series is phenomenal! The writing is exquisite and the acting is wonderful. The multiple story lines are riveting. I'm looking forward to season 4
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great fun. If you like this one you would like some of their others! good fun gaming and it keeps you moving!

159463176X|5.0|What a beautiful storyteller - the first chapter of this book was so good I had to stop to drink it all in. I loved how the last chapter echoed the story in the first chapter. Great read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my sister and I LOVE this game! we are addicted and would not be able to live without it. AWESOMENESS!!!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|If you want to wrap your head around conquering yourself, Steven Pressfield demonstrates how he did it ...and you can too!
B00571F26Y|5.0|So far so good and we are trying to not to eat food containing gluten.<br /><br />There are so many things that contain gluten it is un believable.<br /><br />Wish us luck.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|McCartney is amazing!  One of the best CD's I have heard in a long time!  The arrangements are brillent! Great backup musicians!
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Tarantino at his best.  Great story, excellent character development and acting.  It you liked Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, then you will like this!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it. Wish there were more levels though. Pretty good for a free game. Keeps you busy for a while good way to waste an hour or so.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|I have looked everywhere to buy this.  Finally decided to just get it on line.  I have always enjoyed the movie, now I can watch it whenever I want.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is the best FPS game I have ever played on my tablet. I highly recommend it to FPS lovers.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Overall, am I ever glad I read this book. It gives food for thought. The author spun a very interesting tale, indeed. Quite a different kind of read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is addicting. ive been killing time for over an hour with no plans to stop soon. some clues are frustrating because you think you've looked everywhere but THINK..its right in front of you
030759565X|4.0|After reading through almost the entire book here are my thoughts. I love the breakfast and sweets section the most. The salads section was my least favorite because they were not combinations that appealed to me. I tried making the cheddar cheese breakfast rolls, the gnocchi, and the shell pasta with alfredo sauce today. Everything turned out okay, not as good looking compared to hers but edible. Compared to other cookbooks I've read, she writes in a paragraph format which can sometimes be a little hard to follow but this is the style she also uses on the website. There are pictures for almost every recipe and the stories (about 2-3 paragraphs) before each recipe are endearing. I saw a few recipes that were from her blog such as the brown butter rice krispies but most of it is new material.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. keeps you interested and focused. hope you add more floors soon. can't wait to see what you come up with next!!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Excellent movie. Provides great background for the Wizard of Oz about the Wizard and how he came to use the 'big head'. Loved it!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I bought this half year ago with 3.99. Now it is 99 cents and I am happy and sad at the same time. I am sad because I got it more expensive and happy for the fact that this book finally found its actual correct price. It worth no more than 1 dollar.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the story but it's just not that touching. And it is ridiculous that a girl at age of 5 forgets almost everything about her past and a boy just 1 years older remembers everything all. Not to mention that a boy at 6 has the will, persistence, and ability to stick to a girl with only one year friendship, when he's that young, and remember her for the a dozen years and blame himself to death about almost nothing serious.<br /><br />I don't buy it, at all.<br /><br />I agree that this can be a good story, but the author doesn't write it right.
1449437524|5.0|I really Loved the Story!  Really like the creative humor and common shared experiences about the contradictions dogs really are...
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This high drama show will hook you. Plan to watch when you have lots is time because you won't be able to watch only one episode.
B007V4530A|4.0|Short enough to complete in a single sitting, this book is full of simple, practical advice on how to give a good presentation. While I disagree with the advice about fonts and found the advice about hand gestures questionable, the remainder of the book was at worst a gentle reminder and in many cases held some new tips and ideas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Marvellous so far for beginners though is amazing for now 5 star worth and every penny counts in this amazing rpg style gameplay application
B004HMQ7BI|4.0|really- really like this film. so sweet and romantic, and the actors simply great. I saw it for 3rd time, and did not get bored. if you want happy end without &#34;overdo&#34;, this movie is for you.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Fun movie.  Typical Arnold: good guys versus bad guys.  Lots of action.  Don't expect too much reality.  Well known actors.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I think Argo is one of the best stories never told.  At least till now.  Affleck should have<br />definitely gotten best director.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|Typical thriller but not as good as Angels and Demons or even DeVinci Code. NOt a must read.  But good light fare for summer.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This is a great CD with lots of terrific music.  I love Wagon Wheel.  Makes me want to dance.  All the songs are a five.
B009AMANH4|4.0|I really loved a lot this item, I hope you keep up selling item with high quality. Thanks you so much.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I'll read more.  I'm loyal to a select group of authors, and this book has definitely put Baldacci on that list.
B00000JGHM|4.0|I really loved a lot this item, I hope you keep up selling item with high quality. Thanks you so much.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Exactly what I wanted to keep from buying a new ipod. Classic size with ipod touch capabilities.  Couldn't ask for more.  Easy use doesn't crush battery life.  5 stars!
B0001CNRSE|4.0|I really loved a lot this item, I hope you keep up selling item with high quality. Thanks you so much.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Aside  from the Greatest Hits and the Christmas albums I have every other Joe album. I was counting the days and until the release date...the wait was worth it. If you're a Joe fan already, then you will love this album as Joe's sound on this album is amazing. True R&B. if you aren't a Joe fan, then what are you waiting for? Joe, though underrated, is by far one of the best singers out there. An unbelievable talent! A friend of mine asked me to give a rating of the album on a scale of 1 to 10. I said it was too early to rate it, as I had just gotten the CD and had only listened to it once on the way home from the store when asked for the rating. So rough estimate, I said 8 after listening once. That 8 is becoming a10 the more I listen to it.  This album will make you remember what real music sounds like.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love this movie. I was skeptical at first because it is the popular theme right now, but it's definitely not your typical musical. If you haven't watched it yet, you're missing out!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I love it<br />Good job. I like the first one more tho. But ya it's a great book and I'm hooked
0486424545|4.0|Interesting story - well written - kept my interest - watched the movie also but book was better though it helped to have seen the movie - read this for a classics book club and did not want to read it as I had read Forster's Room With a View which I had not enjoyed but this one turned out to be much better.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Worth all 99 cents so buy it it's soooo awesome and realistic I give props to whoever made this God's app
B0006B2A42|4.0|The fantastic scenery and wonderful actors with an intriguing script all came together to make this a wonderful movie.  I would recommend this movie for anyone wondering what they'll watch on a rainey day and who love the cold war era movies.
B001JI8IJW|5.0|Excellent plot, acting, character development, outcome.<br />The duplicity in arranging the military helicopter rescue of the prisoner was highly dramatic:<br />Operation &#34;Dinner Out&#34;!
0913866156|5.0|This is a well made, high quality tarot deck, and intensely powerful. The readings I have done on these cards are so telling and insightful. Thoth is the one for me.
1781162646|3.0|Overall, I was enjoying this story.  Some rather interesting characters and a fun little romp thru the world of a Joyland, with a little mystery and a ghost. But, the most startling part of this story is when the reader is brutally yanked out of it by one of Kings liberal rants.  It was awful.  FYI, whilst in a story, reality is not welcome!<br /><br />Not story related, I have to admit that I did enjoy reading an actual print book.  I had forgotten how nice paper could be.  Unfortunately, my next paperback will not be SK.
B0002O7XW2|2.0|This is not a very good movie but it does contain some of Robert Prosky's best acting ever. At least until \\"The Great Outdoors\\".<br /><br />Would somebody please take that keyboard away from John Carpenter?
B00992CF6W|3.0|I believe it need bluetouth controller conpatubeled please and make the map buyer for high end tablets thanks for reading
B009LMTDL0|2.0|Was hoping for new insights, something to help me lean in more often, but nature is nature. We are what we are, and women consider the bigger picture before leaning in. Lots of statistics, not too many practical suggestions.<br /><br />I really like the For Women Only series of books. They have a Christian slant, but advice/observations more relevant than Lean In.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is one of the best period romance/drama movies I have seen to date. It is a long film, but in order to do justice to the novel it has to be long. The cinematography is beautifully done. I highly recommend this film.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Not an easy game to navigate on the Kindle. Will give it another try, but I lioke other games alot more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So, I've played a lot of game's and that's my problem. It's hard for me to find a game that I like. I downloaded this thinking it would be simple and not entertaining. ...... Boy was I wrong it keeps your attention and it make you think hard. Escaping every floor is an accomplishment.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Order this Blu-ray to replace another DVD in our collections. perfect picture and happy as we turn over the collection. More to come.
B0056BMK6K|3.0|Being a writer with an e-Book out I was recommended this book. I did find it very useful, but after reading other reviews on here that the author actually paid people to review his books for him (something he omitted from this book) I came away feeling a little dirty.<br /><br />Yes he goes on a lot about all his other books and how successful he is and in places I found he could've gotten to the point a little quicker. Having said that he admits that he's not a great writer, but a better marketer, which is fair enough I suppose.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? To someone who hasn't got a clue about marketing - yes. I gave him 3 stars instead of 4 due to the reviews saying he paid people to review his books.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|(Wife of racer42 commenting...)  I had to stop reading at 75% to get on here and write my review to say that you are absolutely brilliant in your storytelling!  I had it all wrong with the wrong ideas, wondering, until I got to Loc 3782.  I love your book and recommending to all my girlfriends - in fact I'm reading this part to my husband as I need to talk to SOMEBODY about it!!!!!!  I'm going back now to finish this story.  Thank you for the good read!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Like the actors, job well done, some actors you get to hate then get to like them in the end. Story line is enjoyable and anticipation for the next week. Great entertainment keep up the good work
B000002HEP|5.0|I've been a Kyuss fan since 'Blues for the Red Sun' first came out and while I think that is a 5 star release, I think this CD is the band's pinnacle. Their sound is sludgy and groovy like a benevolent Black Sabbath. The riffs are mesmerizing and infectious, and the vocals are just damn perfect for this sound. Everything came together on this release. If you are a fan of rock music, you owe it to yourself to become familiar with this CD.
B008MM9630|5.0|You don't have to spend your own money to enjoy this game like a lot of other free farming games.  This game is fun and actually free!!!
B00122PJ74|5.0|Sometimes the perfect blend of talent comes together and makes something amazing. This CD is one of those times. The vocals, the guitar riffs, the bass, the grooves, the tone, the memorable songwriting. It all works in a way that gets your head banging and you singing along. I consider myself lucky to have found this band when this came out. Simply amazing heavy rock. While I like Queens of the Stone Age, Garcia and Homme were truly a legendary match. It is truly a shame they didn't get more recognition.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My whole family loves Downton Abbey! I hope they keep it on this level and don't fall to American TV standards. Can't wait for season 4!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I feel this is the best game I have ever downloaded. Just wish there were more than 10 levels. Definitely get this app.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I want an app to take some notes, but not at the expense of my contact info and content privacy. Change these permissions. Not installing this app.<br /><br />12/5/2013 Update:  I started using Google Keep, which is an extension of Google Docs, and haven't had any regrets.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I really enjoyed playing Flower, it is by far the best game in the bunch.  Journey was good at pulling you into the game, but the journey wasn't very long.  Flow was fun I played it with a friend for about 4 hours.  But I haven't touched it since.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|works great on the kindle fire. very interactive and fun. not extremely difficult... not like 100 floors like some reviews said. cant wait for more levels.
1594204217|4.0|I had read most of Pollan's other food-related books, and enjoyed them as well as this one.  He makes a compelling case for cooking, and how that word has changed over the past 50 or so years.  His themes of fire, water, air and earth were interesting, but I also found it restricting.  In a society where 'cooking from scratch' is becoming a rare activity, focusing on other topics which make it less rare may have been more productive.  I do believe the first two themes fire (BBQ) and water (braising) accomplish this, but am not sure about the latter two air (bread) and earth (fermentation).  I know that I will certainly try both at some point, but I'm not sure how realistic making them part of a daily, monthly or annual routine is.  At the same time, I am glad Pollan just didn't simply assemble a cookbook or 'tips' book, as that's not what he does best.  Overall, I enjoyed the book, and look forward to his next one.
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|This movie was long and drawn out, confusing, and just plain weird. Also, the some of the character makeup is even weirder than the storyline. We sometimes found ourselves laughing at more serious scenes because of the weird makeup and characters, which could pretty distracting. It was a waste of time and money.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|The cd is great music but mine showed up with a scratch I should of return it cause I have to skip a few songs that don't play r right :(
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is difficult to find App with good radar to keep track of summer thunderstorms. This is my favorite and most useful weather app for keeping tabs on those pesky summer storms that pop up to ruin my outdoor plans.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|If you loved classic arcade scrolling shooters, you'll love this app. It has a retro visual style with sleek modern effects, sounds great with a catchy theme, and plays smoothly. Three game modes (Conquest/Hardcore/Survival) and multiple touch input options (Tilt/Touch/Direct) are available. A scoreboard accessible from the main menu displays previous high scores.<br /><br />The ONLY downside to this app, in my opinion, is that it does not offer an option to unlock levels and/or later select a particular level. While in some ways this is holding true to classic arcade scrolling shooters which did not offer level select, phone/tablet game apps are often played when one has just a few free minutes and wants to pass the time, making it difficult to reach higher levels as you're constantly starting over. It is possible to pause the app and send it to the background, but this is somewhat impractical in the long term and as soon as the app is closed your progress is lost.<br /><br />I would love to see some sort of Level Unlock/Level Select introduced in an update, but even without it this app still shines.
1781162646|5.0|This was quite different from what Mr. King usually writes but was very good.  It had enough mystery to keep you guessing.  All in all very good and I would definitely buy more books like this.
B0014JIFWG|4.0|This is my second pair. I won't say they're perfect, (I don't believe in &#34;perfect&#34;) but they sure work in Japan's dusty playgrounds . My first pair is about 3 years old, and the back strap is kind of stretched out, hence the new pair
030789701X|5.0|The guide is very thorough, covering the base game, as well as all the add-ons. The hardcover keeps the book protected very well, but I still wouldn't count on it protecting it from anything above small bumps.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Great Music!! Great Musician!! Great guest artists!!!<br />Joe Bonamassa is my all time favorite blues guitar player. Great concert!!<br />Beth Hart is Awesome!!<br />John Hiatt is an outstanding singer songwriter who's style compliments Joe Bonammasa's.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|I love the item take a few mintues for the image to clear so please be patient, Because at first i thought it didnt work. but when it cleared I was amazed at the quility with 8 in a box quite expensive for a polaroid but granted since they have been dicontinued its a little worth it. But for special occasions i say go for it. Old Vintage always looks that much better.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Great app. Very easy to see the tweets in a mobile device. It's advisable to use it. I have no problems
B0094K1QR8|4.0|It was a very good movie, with some very funny things, would recommend it to anyone!! and it was free!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|The program installed an update indicated as obligatory. This update only indicates publicity for buy the full version and hides the videos.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A little slow in the beginning but becomes gripping and is hard to put down! I highly recommend this book!
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|The program did not run after two weeks. It appears a message that indicates the the program has unexpecdetly stop each time. I have to uninstall it
B001TW68P4|5.0|It's just what I expected. All the good songs and a few I hadn't heard before. I liked it alot.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|This compilation of Whitney's songs is the best one to have. So excellent, it is FAR, FAR better than the 2000 2 CD The Greatest Hits. Reason being, this latest compilation has the ORIGINAL versions of her songs that were truly meant to be heard since their original release. The 2 CD compilation from 2000 was such a damn joke, a waste of people's money and not properly put together; there were way too many remixes, and some of Whitney's smash songs were almost unrecognizable and not worth listening to, because of the WRONGFUL remix treatment they got.<br /><br />With this latest compilation from 2012, we get the hits and hear them the way they were meant to be heard; absolutely no remix was done (and no filler tracks, either). I have heard all of the songs on this single disc set (except for tracks 17 and 18), and they are great; just as we like for them to sound. With this album, you get an essay written by Clive Davis, who touched bases on working with Whitney, and his first sight of her. The musical partnership between these two people is, IMO, one of the greatest of the music entertainment industry. There are also images of her album covers, from the one on her self-titled debut in 1985, all the way up to her I Look To You album from 2009. Nothing on here from 2002's Just Whitney, or her 2003 One Wish Holiday album. A nice added touch to this compilation would have been her take on The Star Spangled Banner, from January, 1991, but I'm not griping; I'm satisfied with what's on here.<br /><br />Whitney, you will always be loved and missed by your fans. God bless you and your family, for you are now singing with the others upstairs.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I'm obsessed. Her songs are perfection. The only fault of the EP is that there are only 5 songs on it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Keeps me super busy and its very addictive I love looking after grooming and training my horse<br />I def recommend this app horse lover or not:)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works pretty well for mobile devices. syncs easily. quite useful. highly recommend for anyone trying to organize everything. I use gtd and it really helps.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If that's possible. Loved every minute of it & have watched it several times. Can't wait for season 4, love this show!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I ordered this at the request of my children.  Honestly,  I wasn't sure if I'd like the movie.  Boy was I wrong.  It was much better than some of the reviews I'd read. See it and judge for yourself
B00CWY76CC|5.0|First review I've ever bothered with! Easy enough to solve, clever enough to be fun. Love it love it love it!
B00000K3CK|5.0|One of the greatest Christmas classics of all time.<br />The true spirit of Christmas and of what Santa Claus really means.<br /><br />Yes, Virginia, THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.<br />And you can see him here.
0380807343|5.0|I read this to my Third graders.  A lot of them have seen the film and I use it to help convey the message that books are usually better than the films.  I hope it encourages them to want to read more on their own.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Loved this movie.<br />I am a long-time birder, and no birder should miss this amazing video!<br /><br />Even non-birders will love the story, the plot, and the stunning scenery presented in this video.<br />No one could watch this and not love it, and not fall in love with birds!
0316017930|5.0|This book really has changed the way I thought of things. I received it right away and It was in great shape. I would recommend it to my friends!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The following words are written by my 8 year old grand daughter. I purchased the app for her and her sister, so I thought that her review might be more helpful for other interested consumers. \\"I like it all but if I had to chose it would be creative. sirvival is ok I do not like survival that much.\\"
B005CRQ4AG|3.0|I have no complaints with the book, but I was really annoyed that I could not purchase this book on Amazon. When I clicked the purchase button, I was directed to Pottermore and had to enter all of my payment information again, then have Pottermore send the book over to Amazon. That's absolutely ridiculous! There is no reason I shouldn't be able to purchase a Kindle book directly from Amazon, and I am disappointed Amazon would allow the Potter franchise to coerce them into such an agreement.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|although only the first 2 songs were to my most liking, but the rest of the songs weren't too bad, though previous albums were better.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game! Fun and easy to play. Great quality. Good story line. Good graphics. Kids enjoyed it. We will play it again
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Reminded me how selfish and greedy people can be.  Tesla was a genius and his spirit was so pure with regards to his desire and intentions for mankind to benefit from his discoveries.  He will be truly appreciated in the future.
B003Y5H574|5.0|In my dating years this reminds me so much of how we were playing the strategy of being cool, etc.  This is so funny and truthful, you do some really dumb things looking for love.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I like this game it's fun and funny.  As with all games it takes a little getting used to but it's fun the entire way.
B0053O89RY|5.0|My favorite family. How the writers come up with these funny, funny situations and one liners is amazing. The characters all work so well with the differences in opinions and emotions. When I feel down this is what I watch to pull me up. We laugh so hard we cry and that is when you know something is really soooo good.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was in keeping with the other books by Hosseini. It was well worth the wait. It took me only a short time to read it. I highly recommend it!
B008220D5K|5.0|I don't  get what people are talking about. This movie is hilarious. If you enjoy the cast and the director you will like this movie.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|If you're new to 30 Seconds to Mars, you MUST listen to this album. All the songs are amazing.. Jared's voice sounds very beautiful. His screams in the songs throughout the album are excellent. The drums sound perfect and so does the guitar. After listening to this album, listen to This Is War, and after that listen to Love Lust Faith+ Dreams. I promise you, you will fall in love with this band.
1933308087|5.0|Jinny Beyer has created the ultimate quilting reference. I appreciate having a source of hundreds of blocks in one volume. An unexpected feature was the section on how to draft a quilt block with some of her designs as examples. I have a greater understanding and appreciation of her work after reading this book.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I don't care what anybody says, this album is great. Yeah, it's true 30 STM changed their sound, but you know what, it's been a great change. I fell in love with the songs as soon as I heard them. I had the opportunity to see 30STM perform Up In the Air and Conquistador before the album was even released, and those songs sound excellent live. So, if you haven't bought this album, DO NOT LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT ITS \\"OVER PRODUCED\\" AND WHAT NOT. DON'T BE A BANDWAGON AND FOLLOW THEIR OPINION. LISTEN TO THE ALBUM AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this game sucks!!!! It is very hard to control and you can only brush one strand of hair at a time. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!! and you have to pay money to unlock things.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I was searching for a &quot;Sim city&quot; type game and this hit the spot.while it IS hard to acquire investment points, I have no problem posting to Facebook. Those who are complaining just don't know how to use Facebook's posts properly :) I do wish land was easier to purchase and the hills were a bit cheaper to remove
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a great story, a must-read, especially for women like me who spent their early 20's in the early 1990s trotting around the US trying to find answers about themselves. I belong to the worn out hiking boot club along with the author.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I ordered this for just one tune &#34;haven't met you yet&#34; but was pleasantly entertained<br />he brings the big band sound to an updated style that I enjoyed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only reason I said not entirely is because it is similar to 100 Floors. Biggest and best difference is the fact that you can explore the entire room. The puzzles are more challenging, and I believe thatthis game is much more fun and way more addictive.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I bought this case little over 3 months ago and it's still in good working condition. I think I might be a little harder on mine than other due to the fact I take to work everyday to read in my car and I use it a couple hours every night. My only complaints are that I shouldn't of gotten white because it has gotten a little dirty and won't come clean.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|It is exciting to learn new ways of presenting and &#34;pitching&#34; yourself and/ business strategy. This book just takes it to a complete new level! I think I've always been aware of more or less how the mind works but this just completely blows the readers mind. I think i'm going right back to page 1 to read it all again and implement these strategies into my own pitch. Well done Oren, this is pure brilliance!
B008CRC506|5.0|I haven't actually watched the DVD yet, but I have seen Season 2 on tv and LOVED IT!  Get it.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|I loved the background provided.  Understanding the politics of China and the British legation were valuable insight as to why this brutal murder was never solved. If you like history of the last century and grisly stories this is for you.  Paul French does relate the details in a more clinical way that makes the reading more palatable.  Any book that causes me to research further into a culture gets my vote.
B00AEBB89W|5.0|My husband was looking for this movie and could not find it (Netflix, rentals, etc...).  Found it at Amazon for the perfect purchase price!  It got here quickly; in time for Father's Day!
B00870Z9HY|3.0|It really can't compare to the original.  I believe Andrew Lloyd Webber should have left well enough alone, rather than attempt a sequel to his Phantom of the Opera.  I believe Gaston Leroux would be rolling over in his grave.  There were some truly amazing staging effects, thoughthe story line really didn't seem to go anywhere until the very end with heightened suspense.  The development of both the characters as well as the story line just didn't seem plausible given the original.  Without actually giving away some of the plot's secrets, it is difficult to imagine Christine Daae willing to give up all for a now sympathetic phantom character, considering his previous murderous insanity.  The music itself, though lovely, rendred no significant memorable melodies to sing along with.  Webber really should have quit while he was ahead.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I love this app so much but .. the kik app itself takes to long to send if it has an &quot;S&quot; it means sending and I was texting some it said &quot;S&quot; for a about a 2 weeks . but only for certain convos other than that this app is amazing I love it so much !!!!
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wonderful movie. You can watch it with your children (8 to 14). They will see themselves as the main characters and you will learn a lot about them.
B00CFITJKW|5.0|Awesome app I could play this all day .I totally recommend this app to people who like the Boeing 747-8I.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|If you like this type, then this is one of the best . It rolls from the beginning to the end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like these kind of apps the whole puzzle thing so this app is amazing I highly reccomend it .
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I thought the app might help with better understanding if battery usage that might let me figure out how to get maximum usage out of it. It is ok for a cheap app but just that.
0307454568|4.0|This product shipped slower then i thought. the cover is kinda bent but besides that it looks new. If your thinking about getting this book, i would from here.
B0000CDL3W|5.0|ARNOLD AT HIS BEST, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS EERIE AND CHILLING PROPHETIC CONSIDERATION IS A MUST FOR ANY ONE , ESPECIALLY THOSE OF US WHO ARE EARTH AND FUTURE WATCHING !
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Both my husband and I enjoy playing this game.  Just wish we wouldn't run out of coins.  We know we can purchase but we prefer not to buy so we wait.  But the game is good.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game. My brothers and I play it to pass the time on road.trips and we love competing and breaking records it is amazing. Go Halfbrick!
B003O86FMW|4.0|After reading The hunger games I had to go on with the saga. I loved the way the story evolves. The book is easy reading but very entertaining, thought provoking and you can't put in down until you are done with it.
0988178532|5.0|Great story! I couldn't put it down....the story keeps you thinking and wondering at each turn of the page.  The characters are very well developed and you can relate to them.  I didn't want the story to end....I will be reading Outin, the author's next book, as soon as it arrives.  This book would be great for a book club.  Enjoy!
3453268725|1.0|What a sad, sad surprise to discover that this version of the book is actually in German.  A language I do not speak, or, beyond the word Nein, actually understand. I was admittedly peeved to discover this and went to the page where I ordered the book. Sure enough, in the fine print, in a section I normally don't look at, it did state the books language as German.  Sure would have been nice if the seller could have made a stronger effort to notify and warn the consumer of the language issue.  But, it's hiding important issues like that that helps the sellersbottom line. As the saying goes, \\"Caveat emptor\\". I'm sure if I complained, I'd get the \\"too bad\\" response where the seller tries to convince me that the butt sex they are forcing on me is actually considered oral sex in other parts of the world.  I'm frustrated enough...so, bottom line,  the book is worthless to me and it will just be trashed.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|I like Summertime Sadness too! Every songs in this album is pretty good! Good quality and comfort minds. Very recommend!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I've been waiting years for the translation of this first in the HH series. It does feel like the starter, but certainly a good start. WritIng clearly not as developed, nor is character. But startling images, complex plotting, some glimpses now into the origins of HH's angst.
B00A7ZHDOO|5.0|this movie far surpassed my expectations. it deserves actually can start not just 5. safe haven is but hack your magnificent and awesome I recommend it to anybody he loves a really awesome love story.
0399246665|5.0|Mommy to be is very happy with my choice.  She is a teacher and feels that these books are &#34;right on&#34; for her new daughter who is due any day!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This crazy awesome story that any nerd like myself can get stuck reading all the way through without having to take a break.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|I am an avid reader of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series (and The Heroes of Olympus series) and also a fan of many other fantasy books and movies and let me just say that I have never in my entre life seen any movie that differed so far from the book. It was like the director read the back cover, and two years later made the movie. The entire plot line was invented; Prosephonie's pearls are such a tiny part in the book it could have been easily ignored, but that is what the plot revolved around in the movie. It could have been done closer to the book and made just as much, if not more money.<br />On top of all this, many major parts of this book have been ignored (spoiler alert) such as Clarrise, the fact that Luke didn't die, Ares, the scorpion venom that poisons Thalia, and much more. How are they going to make The Sea of Monsters?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!!!! I can't stop playing it, by far my favorite game on my phone and kindle. It's a must have!!!!!
B0027UY8B8|5.0|or...2 weeks off of work enjoyment,but a great series non the less. Watch and enjoy for many days to come!
1401323952|4.0|I loved this book.  Her suggestions are wonderful, the pictures are terrific, and the recipes are easy.  She writes and cooks like a mom who has a job, who likes to cook, eat, and entertain but who doesn't have all day to get dinner ready.
B006ZJJ70O|4.0|Five stars for the recordings 1954 to 1968, four stars the rest.  Stokowski is wonderful in the RCA Victor recordings from the early stereo era (Wagner, Enesco, Liszt, and some of the bon-bons.  I also can recommend without reservation, tweakings and all, the Shostakovich, Khachaturian, and Rimsky-Korsakov items.  The later recordings from the 70s are more variable, some excellent, some undermined by weird patches of re-orchestration, and are sonically uneven.  The Beethoven, Brahms and Rimsky-Korsakov (Sheherazad, Russian Easter) are successful. The Tchaikovsky and Dvorak, less so. I found the Mahler 2 (which has the virtue of great sound) a mixed bag of resplendent sonority, celestial majesty, and earthbound vulgarity.  The Wagner is for the most part splendid but Stokowski does take some fanciful and garish liberties here and there that may upset traditionalists.  The discs of short encores had less appeal to me personally but are all well performed.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I HATED these books!  No, actually I love them.  Oh, I can't decide, and I'll never be able to.  I wrote a much longer review, but I haven't figured out how to paste it (it's on a weird program).  As soon as I do, I'll show you.
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|Hans Zimmer's MAN OF STEEL score is BEAUTIFUL. Too bad we only get a truncated version of it on this CD. What a rip off.<br /><br />When listening to a score on CD, like w/ Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Superman, Batman, etc., you should be able to watch the movie in your head.  Effortlessly.  You cant with this CD.  It's only a partial score, and it sounds disjointed & incomplete.<br /><br />This CD doesn't do Hans' gorgeous score justice. Such a shame.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey so much and have watched episodes over and over!  I enjoy the scenery, the costumes and love to see how these Estates were run.<br />I would recommend to everyone.
1442359919|5.0|Great story line, I hated to see this one end.  I love King's writing, especially when his subject matter is more about almost normal people, as in 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  A college kid is hired as summer help for a local carnival, life-long relationships are established, a murder mystery is presented and the fun begins.  Sounds like pretty standard fare....but King makes the characters come to life and gives a fresh slant to an old story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'll never understand how this show hooked me, but knowing that Amazon Prime grants me access to three seasons of Downton Abbey makes membership that much more worthwhile.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|While this book is well written and easy to read, I find that it is geared to a small fraction of the work force - those with the means, education, and opportunity to attain the highest leveled of management. Also, what works and is the norm in the high tech industry does not apply to other industries. But, there are some excellent observations and suggestions, particularly about the behaviors women innately have that tends to hold us back.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Fine, imaginative movie that we all enjoyed immensely.  Recommend this movie to all.  I need five more words to submit this.
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|it's a very silly movie, but i enjoyed it. it is a spoof on science fiction shows like star trek, which i like. even though it's silly it has heart and is funny.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last book in the series, I actually didn't like it that much.  I thought the ended was sad and things turn dark and desperate for the main character very fast.
B007REV4YI|2.0|Daniel Craig still the worst 007 ever, the storyline is boring, nothing exciting with very bad ending. I would get rid of the screen writer forever.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I finally decided to read the series and see what all the hype was about.  It was pretty good, I can see why so many people like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway sufers is the best game ever!!If you don't think this then you stink like a skunk! You guys have the stupidest comments ever!I mean you guys say there's levels there's not you say you can't get on Facebook well how about get internet on your tablet!Goodbye!<br /><br />Ps learn to spell some people I read your opinion!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I was very surprised at just how much I enjoyed reading this book.  I am looking forward to the second part coming out in January.  I also read that Tim Burton has accepted to produce the movie so make sure you read the books before it's too late!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this app. It is great for your kids, great for teenagers, great for adults, I bet pets would play it if they could! It's a hoot, too! The characters are cool and the hats are a nice touch. Plus, it comes in different languages for those who need it. If I were u, I would buy this app.<br />Ttyl :)
0307278255|4.0|good book, decent price, not as low priced as I can find, but good deal for one of my favorite new writers. Good collection of short stories.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I was looking for a fun free driving app and this on was highly rated so downloaded it and have no regrets.... I take it out of a virtual spin when I have a few minutes to kill and. It's always fun.... Love it!
B005KCGIUY|4.0|The item came to me in a timely fashion which was fantastic. I will preface my next statement with this one: I bought it used so I knew to expect some wear. However, it looked as though it had been run through a cleaner which is usually a bit concerning for me. But it plays fine and I have really been enjoying it.Thanks
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I ordered this with some speculation.  Many of the reviews were quite negative.  When I received it I carefully followed the directions and to my surprise it was very easy to use.  It was exactly what I wanted and what the discription said it was.  I know every person has different needs but when my 6 year old grandson came over it was very easy for him to use in a differnet way to play his games.  I am very pleased.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie for both children and adults. Can't wait to see number 2! With little ones in sure we won't get to get to a theater do amazon will get our business again lol. Parents of little ones know what I mean. Have to wait til they go to bed. Then movie night!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is amazing.it is three lanes of extream exitment. I love Despicable Me minion rush you should really get this app
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|this stands out from your typical kids movie, and I cant wait for the sequel! It's worth the watch :)
B006HGXGWU|4.0|As others have noted, TAKE SHELTER is rather slow-moving and will probably prove too uneventful for those wanting fast action and such. The plot, however, moves at a very natural pace, and I know of few films that do such a fine job of portraying ordinary Middle American people. Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain (of ZERO DARK THIRTY fame) are outstanding in their roles as such people, as are most of the rest of the cast.<br /><br />TAKE SHELTER affords its audience a great deal of empathy with someone suffering from schizophrenia and is very revealing of the impact it can have on every aspect of that person's life. The ending is a bit hard to interpret, and the director declines to offer any explanation during his Special Features Commentary. The way I see it, it has something to do with the frequent question of \\"Who's really to say what's real and what's hallucination?\\"
6305428352|5.0|I'm glad that I bought the DVD.  This is a movie that I like to watch from time to time.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I'm very disappointed at the last Book from the Sookie Stackhouse Serie. It felt like that there was no heart anymore from the Author in it. It is not comparable to any of the other Sookie Books. I myself can't believe the ending....<br /><br />It just seems there is no flow to the whole story .The characters seemed different.<br />The book was not exciting. I think the whole story could have been build out much more.<br />More twists in it. Another Love Story , Sookie and Eric staying together , Freyda dead and killed  by Sookie out of jealously , Sookie turned against her will as punishment from Glasgow , Tara hates Sookie and teamed up with Claude , something more exciting. I think there are a lot more angles and the book could have been much better.<br />It felt that the Author just wanted to be done with it. I'm surprised and again disappointed. I know I use the word \\"disappointed \\" a lot but that's how I truly feel.<br />I know it ended but I would love to hear more from Sookie with the energy that started all.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|Its completely unconventional and thats the whole selling point, (((spoilers))) There is no story as to how the Zombies came to be or for that matter how they are turning back.. other than saying \\"love\\" is curing them.. its a cute movie in terms of a romance but overall the plot is extremely thin. Many of the highlights of this movie are in the trailer, and yeah there funny n the movie too. there is absolutely ZERO suspence in this film, you already know whats going to happen..  But even with that said its still fun watching this play out and the two main stars connect.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What can I say....this movie was outstanding, comical and even my husband liked it! Now that the second one is coming out, I had to have this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|mindcraft is awesome!!!!!they just updated it too.the game is very fun and a great time passer.The ONLY thing i would change is the animals.There are only pigs,sheep,cows,and chickens.I luv the eggs u can spawn on creative now though.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|The greatest serial I have ever watched. Every minute gets you so involved with suspense. I wish he makers bring out the next season.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Loved this game. Very addicting. Spent no money so far and you def don't have to. Still remain a challenge without being impossible if you don't want to spend money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|loved this show from the start wish I didn't have to wait to see more was disappointed in the ending of season 3 but that's the way it goes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love  playing its so much fun you will love this game it's ALMOST like the real world it's amazing
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app is awfull. Battery eating app it charged me two dollers (when it says its free) don't get this app!!!!
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I like it, it's pretty awesome! There are some things,like when you take the rocket you almost always die when you land everything else I give  a pretty good rating!:)
B000002G7E|5.0|Question: How do you follow an album as beautiful, original, and characteristic as The Velvet Underground & Nico?<br />Answer: Throw everything out the window.<br />That was the answer that Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Maureen Tucker gave with their 1968 sophomore follow-up to their 1967 classic debut. Someone once told me that every generation of musicians make music that is a direct reaction to the previous generation. Not only did Reed and the rest of the Velvets react to everything that came before them, they reacted to their own previous ventures.<br />Throwing out the beauty, carefulness, and delicateness that surrounds their first album (as well as the departure of Nico), the quartet changed their sound, adding fuzz and guitar affects that boosted the volume and the feedback that was glimpsed at on The Velvet Underground & Nico. But while their previous album had merely hinted at that chaos, White Light/White Heat put it in the foreground, making it this album's main character.<br />The album's titular track kicks off the album, in a style that basically laid the groundwork for the next decade's characteristic glam rock atmosphere (Bowie himself has covered the song several times). The song feels reminiscent of the driving poppiness of late 1950's to early 60's rock, but with a hint of darkness.<br />Next up is the odd Cale-narrated story tune \\"The Gift\\", which features Cale's deadpan Welsh accent telling an odd little tale with the rest of the band jamming in the other ear. \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" may be the most innovative track on the album, which features Cale and Reed exchanging lyrics at unexpected times, as well as some characteristic dark lyrics. \\"Here She Comes Now\\" adds a bit of beauty to the mix, with a quietly driving rhythm section over Reed's sprawling lyrics and smooth voice, which proves to be just all quiet before the storm, as \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" explodes with the noise characteristic of the rest of the album. Like the album's opener, the penultimate track has a driving, slightly poppy style to it.<br />The other half of the record is home to the album's epic final track, the loud, debauchery-filled, and all-out jam out \\"Sister Ray\\". Simply put, this song makes the album. From the first notes of the constant guitar riff, this song has a certain finality to it that acts as a great closer for the album. With lyrics that depict a tale filled with pimps, prostitutes, pushers, and passersby, as well as some of the wildest guitar licks Lou Reed ever put on record, \\"Sister Ray\\" dominates this album.<br />When it was released 45 years ago, White Light/White Heat few saw how influential the album could be. Now, with hindsight, we can see the fingerprints of the band all over most of rock music today.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE this game...very challenging!! Totally recommend it to anyone up for a challenge. Hope you all enjoy it because I definitely do!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The stories of those in King's Landing and throughout the realm draw you into the world Martin has created and let's you experience what the characters are going thru, as only a good writer can
1449410243|5.0|I purchased this for my sister-in-law.  She loved it and even quotes it about every time I see her now
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids and neices and nephews all love this game. It keeps them busy for hours. Except for the last few weeks I have been unable to Connect to Facebook with this game.
0316066524|1.0|could not would not read.<br />james joyce mark danielewski and dan brown umberto eco fans will no doubt appreciate<br />what i could not.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so cool and I am so glad that I have this game because I am so good at it too!
B005K01VZS|5.0|It is written much the same as Tuesdays with Maury which I also enjoyed.  It shows a very compassionate relationship.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|It was colorful, fast moving and kept us interested. My 7yr old grandson liked it alot and watched it twice. He liked it better the second time.
B000VHXD7O|3.0|I am a Nicolas Cage fan which is probably the main reason I watched this movie.  After watching the first 15 or so minutes, i realized that I had already seen this movie so did not bother to watch the rest of it due to the fact that I didn't think it was worth watching a second time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is highly addicting! I spend hours playing it, all the different rooms gives you a variety of favorites to play!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great series...!!!!  I especially loved the Bonus disc and all the extra content it provided.  I would definitely recommend this series to ANY Rocky Fan :)
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I enjoyed this game on Armor Games s I picked it up for my Kindle. The touchscreen controls work better than mouse controls. Highly recommended.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I have been hooked since the first episode. Jackie continues to meddle and shake things up a bit. While Felicia handles her and her feelings with great dignity. Lots of new twists to keep you hooked.
030758836X|3.0|GONE GIRL has a great set up- A wife disappears on her 5th anniversary and the husband goes from object of concern to object of suspicion in quick order. We see the husband's dilemma in real time as he contends with the police investigation that aims squarely at him and then the readers gets to see the wife through her detailed and heartbreaking journals as she writes of the slow and painful dissolution of her marriage and her valiant attempts to save it. As the mystery unravels the reader does get delightfully entangled in the \\"Did he or didn't he?\\" concept. Then the big reveal hits and its a good one that I didn't see coming and I was intrigued to see how it would play out. But my problem with the novel starts here as Flynn doesn't pull off an ending that matches the quality of what came before. The plot starts to meander as one far fetched incident after another bog down what was an excellent idea into a book that is ultimately disappointing.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am glad that Sookie ended up with Sam. It gives her some normalcy. Everything from Kindle is great. THanks
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've enjoyed his blog but his book was still a surprise. Painfully honest and insightful and absolutely one of the most interesting I've read in years. I guarantee you'll finish in one sitting.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Shows the inside and outs of mental health and how it can cause stigmas as wells as promote positive interaction if taken care of properly. GReat to use in my psych class
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Season 6 is the continuing tale of the mysterious, heroic, intense, and mysterious time-traveling alien Doctor.  This season features the Eleventh incarnation of the Doctor as played by Matt Smith.  He's joined by his companions; married couple Amy and Rory (Karen Gilan and Arthur Darvil) and sometimes the very beautiful, and extremely mysterious River Song (Alex Kingston.)<br /><br />I can't give away too much!  As River would say:  &#34;Spoilers&#34;.<br /><br />The season starts off with a shocking event that soon draws the characters into an epic series of mysteries.  Can the Doctor avoid his own demise?  What's going on with Amy?  Who exactly is River Song?  At last we learn who River Song is!<br /><br />Rather than the serial episodes from the Classic Who era, head writer Steven Moffat weaves mysteries, and puzzles throughout the entire season.  There are clues through-out.  It does make it a bit difficult for the casual viewer to keep track of.  There are a few &#34;one off&#34; episodes that are just fun, and maybe a bit spooky.  From space, past, present, and future the Doctor and his friends also sail the high seas with a pirate captain, battle mermaids, meet the TARDIS in human form, save a little boy from his Nighterrors, and fight off a scary monster in a hotel themed labyrinth.
B007THA4FI|5.0|It was hard to read this novel after Harry but it was good. I cried. Such strong words and feelings but nothing will compare to Harry. It was hard reading an adult novel from her
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|very good show for people who like science fiction... not many other current sci fi shows on t.v. that are as good
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Who ever loves adventure movies will love this. Most awesomest movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That many !s is crazzzzy! You better get it!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I was appalled to see what goes on &#34;behind the scenes&#34; in the food industry.  I'm sure this is just the tip of the iceberg.  If I hadn't already decided to reduce my meat consumption and eat only hormone-free and free-range meat products, I would have sworn off eating any feedlot meat.  The only thing I know to do is to share this and keep trying to enlighten others.  It's a real shame that it's all for the mighty dollar... health and animal welfare be damned!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's  the best game for kindle fire. I love it. For me it's even better because I don't have pc or Xbox edition.  Though it really needs to be more like pc and Xbox editions
B002MCJZHS|5.0|This album is pure joy for your listening pleasure.  English Indy Pop with minimalist instrumentation and whisper like haunting vocals will mesmerize.  Lyrics speak of relationships and love.  This  album is by far the best yet from The xx.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|Have loved this movie since it first came out and I saw it in high school. The visuals aren't as cutting edge as they were in it's time, but still fun to see again whenever I want. I have always loved cars, even being a girl, and the race scenes are fun. The romance makes it a chick-flick, but the cars make it somewhat interesting for guys too. Glad I have it.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This soundtrack is so good. I enjoy listening to it and appreciate the vocals of Hugh Jackson imparticularly.<br />I highly recommend.
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|All of the songs were great. Michael Bolton really reminds me of the Righteous brothers and their blue eyed soul.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a good storyline. However it seemed a little rushed at times,the love story seemed \\"forced\\" Thor's good fortunes are quite frankly too good. He's just a little too lucky and magical with all the royalty welcoming and accepting him for the most part.All in all it was a good little get away
0470570954|5.0|I wanted to get a head start on this subject and after doing a lot of research on biochem textbooks, I settled on this one.  I am absolutely delighted with my purchase.  It is packed with details and brilliant illustrations.  I can't recommend this book enough, it will be a reference for years to come.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a very nice game kids are sure to have a lot of fun with as time goes by.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was glued to my tablet from the first chapter. The writing gets a little bland at some points (I skipped entire, overly descriptive passages), and the ending was completely rushed. So rushed that I kept checking to make sure I didn't accidentally skip over a chapter. But there were some excellent surprises, and overall, the story was totally compelling.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wonderful brain game and very challenging, please make more levels, I feel like I'm addicted to this game and I'm looking forward to more levels, I would even pay for this one. Love it!
076790592X|5.0|Great book to ready. Gives you a different perspective on life and how to view people. Recommend for anyone to read.
B003SI1W3K|4.0|Anything to keep the kids entertained...money was well spent.  This was our first purchase on instant video.  Very convenient and makes our PS3 so much more functional.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I was expecting much more from Mr. West. i've enjoyed his music for many a year and i was extremely excited when this album was announced. However, it's a lot different from his previous work and not a good different. Of course this is my personal opinion and i've been a fan long enough that if Kanye West releases another album i'll definitely give it a chance, but this one came up short on expectations.
B009Z59ZNE|4.0|I learned that really ugly stuff goes on in high levels of politics, sad but very interesting.  Just goes to show you can never really trust these people.  They all have dirty little secrets and hidden agendas.<br /><br />Now I want to watch the American version to see how it compares.<br /><br />Not predictable and very well acted.  Only complaint was that the sound quality of the first CD was not as good as the other two.  Maybe just my copy but that was disappointing.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Enjoyed Tess of the D'urbervilles very much.  I enjoy movies from this time period and suggested it to my sister who also enjoyed it.
B00CCKWUNG|5.0|Could quite possibly be Tarantino's best film. Should have received the best director Oscar for this one.<br />And since you SHOULD buy it, why not get the steelbook? Looks amazing.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Give me more! not to hard at first, makes you think a little, get it wrong a few times, then vuala! you figure it out getting that brain high we play these games for.  replayabilty too.  I was going through the older Quells I had beaten last year when I found out they had made a new one.<br />Multiple reasons to play eeach level more than once- figure out the perfect move sequence,  find the jewel's and hidden levels.  I absolutely love these games.  you feel so dang smart when you figure a level out!  and it is not so hard a ten year old cant do it, most times.  if you really do get stuck they give you coins for completing levels you can use to guide you through the solution of those you have lost patience for.<br />Again, brilliant!
0143143492|3.0|I bought the audio version of this book. I think it's the author himself who is reading it which was a mistake on the publishers part because he is very difficult to understand.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. Any problem ive ever had, with credits, they have fixed right away. Great fun game<br />.
B000007489|5.0|I had this album on cassette back in the 80s. Their music still sounds great even though I'm over twice as old as when I first started listening to the Suicidal Tendencies.
B00AO2TREY|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worst albums I bought this year - cheesy lyrics with moaning vocals. I liked a couple of songs by HURTS. I think \\"Wonderful Life\\" is just a one hit wonder!<br />Avoid this album!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Any fan of the 007 franchise, both old and new, will enjoy this movie.  Loved the throwbacks to the Sean Connery days.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|best drip hose out there with a lifetime warranty you can't beat buying.  I love it and highly recommend it
1442359315|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The fact that the author is a physician lends a lot of credibility to his story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I absolutely love this weather app. I have used others and I rate this above all the rest! You can choose several locations in case you want to keep up with the weather where friends and/or family live. It shows you what the temperature is and what it feels like. The maps and graphs are so easy to read and very helpful. I really like the radar map that shows if any storms are in the area. You can completely personalize this app to your desires. It will tell you ideal days for outdoor sports, outdoor dyi, fishing, and many more! What are you waiting for...download this app..it's free you have nothing to lose!!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is a lovely modern musical with an awesome soundtrack.  The actors portraying the two main characters are not trained in acting, they are professional musicians.  They both do a great job.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its the bestgame! it is soooooooo fun and addictive! I love this game you are put to the test its awesome!
B004CEUEWE|4.0|This is certainly worth watching.  Good plot and reasonably good acting.  Unlike many action movies it is not filled with stupid and unbelievable stunts.
B007SSEZNA|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable in this, and I love the story.  I love these types of movies, so I thoroughly enjoyed watching.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Picked this book up on the free list. It's a good story in an interesting future setting. I am now going to look for other books by Weber, especially any more with honor Harrington.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I really enjoy period shows and movies, and this was just a random gem that I tried (The first part of this, then I was happy to buy this part).  I was sad to learn there were not any more episodes.  Love Judi Dench - she is amazing as always!
0790729377|3.0|WOW you can tell the movie was a bomb.. as it tanked in my point of view! Almost sad to say I saw it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is so addictive but there really needs to be a way to get invester credits easier so you can expand quicker

B0034G4P8A|4.0|I don't know a thing about Norse mythology or the Marvel comics featuring Thor.  I had to accept this movie on its own terms as a live action comic book that couldn't decide if it was meant to be funny or to be taken seriously.  It literally starts in the dark and stays there far longer than it should, even when one of the characters teases, \\"wait for it.............\\"  I did.  What followed was a little fancy in the sky, a dust tornado, and the thud of Thor almost becoming road kill.  A bit of history was imparted in a grandiose manner.  Lots of CGI was employed (it seems these days that action films are becoming more animated than live action).  The plot involves two brothers born to be kings, but there can be only one!  One is arrogant (Thor), the other is just plain sneaky (Loki).  What follows is insubordination, insurrection, and expulsion to the planet Earth (the all-purpose penal colony for superheroes).  There's even a comparison to be had with The Sword in the Stone (who is worthy to wield the hammer of Thor!?).  Many pull but only one can master it.<br />As far as action packed superhero flicks go, this one does what it's supposed to (which is neither faint praise nor vain glory).  No one really stood out.  The villain of the piece, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was a bit wishy-washy.  Anthony Hopkins opted out for a snooze.  I didn't even realize Rene Russo (Odin's wife) was even in this film!<br /><br />It was entertaining.  I did like it.  But I expected more than just a little razzle-dazzle.  If they come out with a Thor 2 I'd see it and hope for the best (because this certainly wasn't).

B004FHCH96|3.0|i bought this movie because it was similar to inception. the storyline was appealing and interesting. i made an error of judgement in not checking the detailed ratings of this film. on watching it i realised there was obscene language in it and had to take off the film. those who tolerate movies with this language may find it enjoyable.

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|For the life of me I don't understand why Disney feels the need to put curse words into the beginning of the movie. makes no sense doesn't add anything to the movie only and could have easily been left out. The two curse words just left a bitter taste in my mouth because this is supposed to be a Disney movie, a family movie. The special effects were incredible and the story was pretty good. Overall I liked it.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I would not have started this series if I had known it was longer than a trilogy.  When I purchased the first book over a year ago it was titled a TRILOGY.  Unfortunately I pre-purchased this book before it's release.  I never would have bought it if I had known it was not the end.  I too was very disappointed and felt taken advantage of.

B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a really great game that lets you do a lot of things. Let's you have a lot of freedom
B0091WNK8M|4.0|THIS MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT BEING SILLY AND ENJOY WATCHING SILLINESS; BUT SOMETIMES YOU NEED A BREAK FROM LIFE AND GO TO SOMEPLACE ELSE, THIS MOVIE WOULD FIT THE BILL.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|i love this game a lot and its a good game for babies.<br />my niece loves this game and always wants to play it.
1616550414|5.0|This was everything I thought it would be. Total history of the Zelda franshise. This is a sturdy book has some weight to it. If your a zelda fan it is a must buy
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a great app! ! it is challenging in parts but is easy enough to be fun. i didnt like that you had to keep turning off the music every time you played. also is you had to exit out of the game fpr any reason it didnt save your action at all for that level. HOWEVER I REcOMEND THIS APP To everyone because it is addicting!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good<br /><br />This gun vs c<br />F chainsaw xxx s cc th f2f a f2f song f f2f had Ethan<br />Megatron and the rest of this year ans
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|Admittedly you can't expect a 600+ page book to be made into a 2 hour movie and not have the movie have all of the nuances of the book. While I did enjoy the CG Souls I can't bring myself to want to watch this movie a second time. If you enjoyed the book--rent the movie--don't buy it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Awesome Show! Loved watching every minute of it. It kept me laughing. Love all the characters. Can't wait for season 9.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Good story with lots of twists. The acting was very good. Only problem was loose ends that we're not explained.
B004132HZS|5.0|I checked this show out on a whim thanks to a recommendation of a friend and I'm so glad I did.  As most shows of even an hour length tend to lose my attention, at 90 minutes an episode, I thought &#34;Sherlock&#34; stood no chance at gaining my attention.  But lo and behold, I finished two seasons of the show in about two weeks because I was absolutely hooked.  Great writing, fast pacing, and electrifying chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman make &#34;Sherlock&#34; a crime standout.  There's no &#34;British charm&#34; spell cast on me either; I have tried watching many BBC shows in the past couple years and came up very empty handed.  &#34;Sherlock&#34; is the real deal; just a fantastic show.  There are moments of definite cheese, but you seem to forgive it for all the other smart moves it makes.  In the end you just find yourself with a show that has broader appeal, hence why I bought the DVDs for my father and got him hooked as well.  Can't remember the last time we bonded on a piece of entertainment, so thanks &#34;Sherlock!&#34;
B00COH0W00|5.0|A wonderfully romantic story with just the right cast to make it both captivating and entertaining.  Would recommend it for a Saturday night to be watched together with that special someone in your life.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|I like this game but having no controls for the speed of the boat (especially if you don't usually play racing games) really blows.  My game usually consists of crashing from outpost to outpost rather than racing from outpost to outpost.  If you crash too much you lose momentum and houses that used to be destructable are now houses you get stuck behind because you have no momentum to crash through them.  This, of course, kills your time to the next outpost so you don't make any money (I've quit trying to aim for the bags of money along the route).  I wish this game had speed controls or different skills levels so that racing beginners (like me) aren't so frustrated trying to play it.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Unlike some other forms of the theatrical arts such as a play or a Broadway musical, movies are rarely produced more than once.  Even when they are, the productions are often separated by many years and like plays and musicals, have totally different casts.  Therefore Richard Donner's version of the movie, the first version of the movie before it was reshot under a different director and released commercially, gives some fascinating insights into how the same basic script with the same actors can be directed so differently.  It was fun to see the various changes that were made from the first version to the final relase.  The only problem I had was that the format of the DVD was completely unreadable by multiple DVD players and computers using multiple programs and only worked on a single, portable DVD player.  If my portable player ever stops working, goodbye Superman II.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Game is fun, just like Minecraft but with more of a RPG feel instead of just digging and building. I paid $3 but it DRAINS my phone battery so I haven't played it much, but its a good 3D game so that's kinda expected for battery life. For a big screen phone or tablet it would be great. Or as a daily $1 deal its great too
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I Enjoyed season 2 immensely! The cast is superb! Amazon prime is fantastic. I could catch up on all the epidodes I I missed!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Tesla was demeaned by the powerful Edison, and consequently, it is rare to hear about him outside of scientific circles. This short book is a good introduction to his life and his ideas.<br />There are parts, however, where the author gets a little preachy, although not in a terrible way...like a motivational speaker.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey has been the biggest surprise for me. I do enjoy British productions but rarely watch PBS so when I heard about Downton Abbey I decided to give it a look-see. And am I ever glad I did!<br /><br />5 Stars is insufficient to describe the intense pleasure and enjoyment that watching these episodes has given both me and my husband. And for him to watch British productions is rare...<br /><br />I had watched a couple of the 1st season episodes on scheduled TV and from then on, watched them on Amazon Prime. Once my husband fell in love with the series, we sat for hours watching episodes back to back until we had watched them all. We watched them in HD and the streaming experience was also exceptional. The quality of the viewing top notch!<br /><br />Can't wait until January for season 4!
B00992CF6W|3.0|The game is really fun but it needs more animals and I think it needs to be like survival craft
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I usually read the book before watching the movie. But for &#34;Emma,&#34; I ended up watching at my friend's place and I fell in love with it. The script followed the book very closely and Johnny Lee Miller makes a great Mr. Knightley.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is all fun &amp; challenge , playing with friends give you a good laugh when someone loses lol I know I did
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|You go ahead and hump dat!  You go ahead and rump dat!  You give me those squealing feeling!  Pontoons and yelps!  Zonk.
B002FOCXI6|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a wile. Excellent acting, plot, script, etc. Viggo Mortesen is phenomenal.
B004T340QY|5.0|Pretty Funny. Great Bluegrass Music. Chris Thomas King is a great blues musician. Should be a cult classic in its own right.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|A Trekkie fan's must have!<br />Its a great series that gets better with time.<br />ts a star trek fan must have in their collection.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Didn't think I was going to get into the Facebook &#34;thing&#34; but I certainly have.  I check it several times a day.
B000I9YX06|4.0|the threads of the story aren't new - the moral struggle surrounding a race that's designed for no other purpose than to serve mankind; and whether human beings are capable of taking care of each other and the planet the live on.<br />but the movie is enjoyable, the effects are pretty cool and Will Smith, as always, is great. entertaining and fun.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Too much information in the sense that there are a lot of headlines but nothing concrete.  I barely use it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really keeps your interest. Becomes addictive after awhile..!! I recommend this game for all ages...!! It even kept my 9 yo intrigued
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Deleted it. Did not like, how many times would you like me to say I got something I did not expect?
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a really terrific movie ... Russell Crowe's singing is SO BAD that it is actually VERY GOOD! :)  I honestly can't stop listening to it ... It's captivating how hard he tries and I really enjoy it.  Overall, excellent movie --- very well done.  It's a movie I'll watch at-least every year and I rarely watch any movie twice.
B005LAIII0|3.0|forget the hype and the ads, this movie is a rental and not a purchase. Watch it once it is enough
0761166173|5.0|Our 2 daughters really love this book ... It's a nightly read at our house.  They've even memorized it now and love reading along and acting it out ... Sandra Boynton books are really, really great!
B0087ITBT8|4.0|This is a keeper instead of a rental. you can purchase this one with no worries and it has Barbra Streisand in it
B0092MKFIY|3.0|This album has many catchy songs, and a very polished almost popish quality<br /><br />I liked most songs superficially at 1st listen. This could mean it's good, but usually I need something to challenge me a bit for the long haul.
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|If you have read any other reviews of mine you know why I buy too many movies. this is another mistake, it is a rental
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This ebook was simple, easy to read, and full of great tips! Wonderful reference book that I'll be keeping on my kindle fire for the foreseeable future!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not stop reading this book!  It was addictive, passionate, sexy, and made you constantly on the edge waiting to find out what happened next.  The emotions from the characters were amazing.  Anyone who loves romance, should read this book!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing for horse lover it  look so realist and you better leave it hooked up to the charger cause you will loose your battery power because you'll be playing so long
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Love is as messed up as families , families are as messed up as people and who are we to argue? This is a great modern love story that both men and women can enjoy.
B009DTHZNE|5.0|Wonderful video we are huge fans.  It is so interesting to hear the whole PJ story.  would recommend to all fans
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|Slow-progressing movie and (spoiler alert) a take-off of Arnold's &#34;Total Recall&#34;.  Not enough action as &#34;Taken&#34; and fairly predictable.  Somewhat entertaining but not worth a second viewing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book! It was just the right amount of humility and seriousness mixed together..... I would recommend this book to every single on of my friends :) it was quite a tear jerker btw :,)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Although already a believer in \\"Heaven\\", I was interested in learning about Dr. Alexander's shift in perspective based upon his unique experiences. Overall a good book. I hope as a medical doctor, he does help shift the world in belief and understanding of life beyond life.
B000000QFV|4.0|This was the 80's version of black Sabbath . Feels good to me was perfect . Doing this album just felt right at the time , was perfect at the time. I like it .
B00919V2ZS|5.0|The 88 tour was Frank's last tour and with a 12 piece band many of his classic songs were reworked.  I have his complete collection and this release is probably the most played.  Great music with great solo's, especially the Black Page (new age version) and Cruising for Burgers.  If you never listened to Zappa before, I would recommend this release as the best place to start, because it is more music and less smut.
B00A8M7H42|5.0|I've not yet been disappointed by a Kotobukiya statue. No paint problems. No unsightly seams.<br /><br />The lines are solid and smooth, even the fine lines at his shoulders and gloves. The folds of the cape flow nicely behind him.<br /><br />His cape flares onto the ground, making Batman the most stable of the Justice League statues. The magnets do help these statues, but they're not as secure as pegs. With most of these statues, if you bump them or tilt the base a little, they will fall over.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is the right price game and is REALLY fun. I think you should definitely get this awesome APP. It is So much awesomer than other games!!!
B000FA675C|5.0|I 've read it in hardcover. Now my daugther ask for it but she wanted for Kindle. Logic, she is actual.
B0001I561E|5.0|Who doesn't love Robin Williams as the Genie? What a treat. Every time I watch it, I hear another side joke I missed before. So funny.
0395925037|4.0|This book gave me much more information about Adolf.  This book is a good read into the mind of a different thinker.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I bought this for my kids years ago, and it finally wore out. I wanted my granddaughter to see it, and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. A real classic. The music is the best.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|i loved temple  run 2 but now every time i try to play it,it doesnt open to the game and just goes back to my home screen.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Before anyone gets upset that I am reviewing this film before it is released in theaters, I want to let it be known I was fortunate enough to get advanced screening passes for the film. Guillermo del Toro directs two types of films, high concept art house type films usually in Spanish(Pans Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone), and action blockbusters with high budgets and heavy use of CGI (Blade II, Hellboy, and its sequel), this film falls into the latter category, which anyone who has seen the preview can surmise. The dialogue feels canned and cheesy one-liners fly from the mouths of nearly every actor in this film. The plot is as thin and predictable as it is farfetched, but this could all have been guessed from watching the trailer as well.<br /><br />A few actors who weren't featured in the trailers make appearances, I won't spoil who they are or what roles they play, but they are a pleasant surprise as they provide some relief from a story that is a little too serious at times. While no one makes Oscar worthy performance, the acting is perfectly acceptable and on par with most action movies, although some of the actors are not the greatest at American English accents in spite of their efforts. I suppose this can be explained away as the film is set in the future, and who knows what American English will sound like then (I'll bet it will sound quite a lot like mine, my parents', and my grandparents' accents).<br /><br />While the plot, dialogue, and acting are on par with every other action blockbuster of the past decade, I must admit that the CGI and visuals are some of the most realistic I have seen. The visual effects are stunning. Thanks to the amazing work of Industrial Light and Magic there is not a single scene in the film where I felt as though the CGI was blatantly apparent beyond the fact that such things do not exist, something I wish I could say about the recently released Man of Steel. The 3d is also quite good, sometimes 3d is a little overdone and itfeels unnatural and hurts your eyes, this is fortunately not the case with this film. This 3d experience is easily on par with Avatar, probably the result of a film which was intended for 3d from the get go. All in all this film is an entertaining escape, albeit one that may not be too surprising or particularly memorable.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|I've listened to this soundtrack nearly everyday since I got it and I can't get enough of it.  This is actually an album I have wanted since the movie came out.
1592332803|4.0|Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's Joy Of Vegan Baking should have been titled \\"this is vegan??\\" because that's the response most heard after preparing one of the recipes from her book.  Its stuff full of wonderful recipes that my non-vegan friends enjoy as much as vegan  ones!  I love it because its incredibly user-friendly and yet I am able to create beautiful dishes that only look complicated! I often find myself referring to it for last minute \\"mix & match\\" recipes to use with other dishes such as her icing recipes, etc.<br />The book is loaded with tips, ideas and beautiful photographs.  This book should be a staple in very vegan cook's kitchen!
B001TODCII|5.0|great action, Liam Neeson as a true action figure, battling truly EVIL guys (human traffickers)... very ver very highly recommended!!
B003G4W49C|3.0|I read this book because I saw a preview of the movie being released this fall.  It was definitely an interesting read, delving into the mind of a child born to be a leader of future warriors.  Much of the story is Ender's personal struggles with his place in his family, his destiny, and his desire to connect with others.  There are more books in this series but I feel that this first one could stand alone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is full cool. It cant be beget.<br />I love it if I was in it I wold never die.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|I have purchase it some time ago and now it stoped working.<br />Tried to delete it and reinstall but its not downloading anymore.<br />Don´t buy it, or else you will lose your money
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Visually stunning with the story to keep you hooked. My wife and I loved it and have recommended it to everyone we know.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|In my opinion, Adichie is one of the best novelists living today. Americanah is a fitting follow-up to 'Half of a Yellow Sun'.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|Wow that's what I say when I watched the movie, it's such a sweet movie and I might get the book. People you got watch the movie to understand what I'm talking about!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Puzzles are on the simple side but overall a good game.  The tasks to complete in order to move to the next level are sometimes unclear but that simply makes this game slightly more challenging.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This is one game that doesn't seem to be what my grand kids or myself would care much for. I will have to remove it and replace it with another game. Sorry!!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|While not for the faint of heart, the violence in this series rarely feels gratuitous, but rather the entire experience of watching Hannibal is designed from top to bottom to put the viewer off balance, just like its protagonist, Will. It is true suspense, with rich characterizations, exceptional acting and a level of direction and design rarely seen in network TV. This psychological thriller will leave a mark, and shows that network TV still has teeth.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pac man has always been my very favorite game from when it first came out on Atari. I have also played Mrs. Pac man and love it but did not find it on my kindle Fire games but that is ok cause as I said Pac man is my FAVORITE!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish there were more floors.  I really enjoyed the challenge.  Please add more floors soon.  I can't wait for more.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|All my grand kids love Angry Birds so I know that they will love this one also. I am not the Angry type but they are. lol
B000U6BT40|5.0|Great Pilot Great Tv Series to bad they canceled it after 5 seasons they should bring it back on a site like netflix
B007SGM084|2.0|I did not read much positive about this book but one of my closest friend enjoyed it so I decided to make my opinion of it. I have read many sentences over and over again in this book, it was getting annoying to say the least. English is not my first language but I believe I could have done better at avoiding these repetitions.  This novel is definitely written by a women for women, not my type of things, a woman falls in love for a billionaire, who buys her anything, cars, jewlery , a man who tells her to eat, tells her she looks thin, a man who is always there to protect her and also abuse her at the same time, but it is accepted because he was abused? i see where the Author tried to make Anastasia  look independent and not caring about money but I did not fall for this. i would have been happier with a more down to earth man, but it would have taken more imagination to make the readers excited about this man may be?  The story is a mix of pretty woman, and 9 1/2 weeks. I think this author is a genius because she wrote a book that targets women who probably do not have enough sex or never had good kinky  sex. I seriously do not understand the excitement  that I heard so much about. I doubt a child so profoundly abused could get back on his feet so well, this young. It would take more than an abuser fist lover and a psychologist to get him back to a normal functioning life. Christian is abusive to Anastasia in many ways throughout the book, but I never heard anyone mentioned this to me before I read it. He is trying to constantly control her, in may ways, magically gets better...I could not wait to finish it to read a good classic so I can re educate my brain to think the right way.
1400052181|5.0|This is a great summer read. I will be incorporating this book in my science class this upcoming school year.
1250006341|5.0|The same devotion to detail as we have come to expect.  This will have to tide us over until the new season begins in January of  2014.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Fun update of the original Star Trek series. It was cool watching how they all came together to form the crew of the USS Enterprise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a wonderful game. You have to have a great stragity. And I like if your playing for a long time and you having died yet then it gets harder. That's good for the people who are good and who are not so good. Its a great game for me to play!! And I love it because its free.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|And then more walking. And they walked some more. It really didn't need to be as long as it is. The parts that had action were good, it was just a struggle to wait for those parts. I hope part two picks up the pace.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun! I don't have a horse so it's good to have a pet. I enjoy it a lot.
B00973902K|4.0|Very catchy song for pop music. The video is very funny and its nice to see Carly Rae Jepsen doesn't take herself too seriously.
B009EELKMA|5.0|I enjoyed how it started a little slow and then a sweet action packed victory emerged.  Pretty neat cast and filmography too.  I had actually looked for he movie on Netflix and locally to no avail.  Glad amazon has it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved this book, can't wait for the next one to be released.  You get hooked quickly, the book is fairly fast paced.  I loved the characters, the author created them from found vintage photographs!<br /><br />Usually I don't care for novels about teenagers unless the story and the characters are unusual (like the Harry Potter series or the EarthSea books from Ursula Le Guin).  In this case, they are peculiar and now I'm attached to them!
B00A2H9L2E|1.0|the \\"revelation\\" is that this is a total stinker. no plot, no continuity, totally senseless pap. I liked the first one (silent hill) although it had flaws, but this is an insult. lots of fx and well crafted makeup does not a movie make. if you are a fan of the craft of monster makeup this might be a reference piece but other than that, this has no merit what so ever. I am annoyed that I now own the dvd as I know I will never watch it again. ever!!!!!!!!
0062238868|5.0|Former US Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle tells his story, a story heavy on combat and military craft, short on the grueling training that some books emphasize (understandably, because everything thing they do is tippy-top secret).  More than 150 kills are confirmed in Iraq where Kyle focused on killing enemies and saving American lives.  Especiallyu interesting was the recounting of the taking of several major Iraqi cities, including Fallujah, supporting Marines who had to twice invade the city, the first time withdrawn and the keys given to the useless Iraqi military, when Al Jazeerah publicized phony atrocities and the Western press picked them up and ran them endlessly through the 24-hour news cycle. This is an excellent book, gets into the meat of the sniper experience in combat.
B005IQZB14|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Incredible story about an incredible woman and her incredible journey of both spiritually and physically epic proportions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My son and I both got this game for our Kindle Fire HDs.  It was quite challenging but fun. I will admit that there were a few times I had to ask for his help!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I was really looking forward to getting this game on my Kindle Fire it downloads fast witch is awesome but after the cool video at the beginning it stays stuck on the tip page loading and i have to turn my device off to get it working again. I really want to play this on my Kindle so I hope it gets fixed soon.
B000KQGOA4|5.0|I studied &#34;The Planets&#34; in music-school so many years ago, that one of my professors was Sir Adrian Boult himself. I believe the work rises and falls on three elements. Mars must be angry, with its relentless 5/4 time signature. Trombones and Tympani really drive it forth. Jupiter's famous &#34;I Vow to Thee My Country&#34; really needs to be regal and stentorian. Finally, we really need to feel the presence of the organ's lowest notes during the coda of Saturn. This particular performance scores two out of three.<br /><br />Mars has been described as &#34;The Invasion of Poland&#34; but please don't let that put you off. Holst hated war and he wanted the music to convey the concept that war would be the end of humanity. Considering he was writing at the beginning and during WWI, he could have been right. When the organ kicks in during the coda of Saturn you feel it in your bones, as though you were sitting in a great Gothic church. Kudos on the mix. My only disappointment is that Jupiter seems a bit rushed. It's as though Von Karajan was influenced by the title &#34;Jupter the Bringer of Jollity&#34;. Still Jupiter was the &#34;King of the Gods&#34; and I wish his tempi would have reflected it. It is said that Imogen Holst, the composer's daughter favored this version. While this is reprocessed analog, the sound is very warm, which really works for Mars. Perhaps the biggest surprise though is Neptune. Von Karajan wasn't exactly known as an &#34;impressionist's conductor&#34;, but Neptune is as diaphanous as the Zodiacal Light (sunlight beaming off tiny particles in the plane of the Solar System). Essentially - the conductor got it right. Musicianship is first rate and as a treat, he uses Wagnerian Chimes in Saturn with their presage of impending death. Musicologically speaking, it's goose bumps.
B003QTNFHW|5.0|Depp seems to be born to play odd characters, he certainly does it well. This is a more grown up version of Alice - not quite ready to share it with my young grandkids yet.
B005LAIIPS|1.0|IT WILL NOT PLAY IN ANY OF MY PLAYERS OR COMPUTERS. I CLEANED IT TWO TIMES AND REPAIRED IT ONCE.
B0019LZV4E|5.0|Not a fan of Musicals, but Depp was at his best in this movie. He portrayed the deep emotional turmoil of a wronged man seeking vengence. Did not like the end, but it probably couldn't have ended any other way.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I picked up this gamepad to use it with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus (running 4.2.2, rooted).  I suggest you pair it with a GameKlip, and with the SixAxisController app from the Play store.  It will work natively with many devices when cabled (USB OTG), or via bluetooth (app required, but cheap and works well).<br /><br />I've tested it with the android version of SNES9x.  It feels just like playing SNES.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway Surfers is a fun game that people love for it`s silliness.I also like it because there are cool characters, stylish hoverboards, and especially the fat police man.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is so fun becose you can kill scientist's, get gadgets, chose jetpak's and and a lot of stuff it is<br /> so fun!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good book, but I expected more.  Seemed a little choppy to me.  I would have liked to know a little more about what happened to a few of the characters.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this app but I can't update the app on my kindle but I can on my iPod sad face :(
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is set in 18th century America and tells the story of a family of black plantation slaves and a young white girl who is an indentured servant. Kathleen Grissom does an excellent job describing their adaptation to their often difficult lives. Characterization is one of Grissom's strengths. Each character faces  believable problems from the plantation master to the field workers. Not only is there clear class separation between the white owners and their slaves, but there is class separation between the Kitchen House slaves and the field workers. Grissom has written a realistic story about real people coping with the fate life has handed them. I certainly recommend this novel.
1569242739|5.0|Easy to make cupcakes and very delicious! I had no idea vegan baking could be so easy. Recipes are easy to follow.

B0082GQ5HG|4.0|It is a well done video. Very entertaining for young and old. You will enjoy the art of this video and creativity of the artists involved.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Great movie...had it all.  I would recommend this for the family anytime.  We really enjoyed it and had to watch it twice!
B00506NRBS|5.0|I have known for a long time that I want my company to stay small and meet the needs of the primary client, so that people experience success, joy, and empowerment. This was a great read with repetition of basic values and clarity. I have some great touchstone nuggets to hold to as I do what I love to do - be who i love to be - each and every day!
B00003CXDD|3.0|This is another movie I got because I remember watching it when I was a kid.  I liked it back then but now it's not so good.  The acting is corny and the story is a rip-off of LOTR.  But if you grew up in the 80s, you need to get this for your collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Definitely keeps you working to better your skills and get more horses to add to your stable.Plus the way you can get awesome backgrounds and tack? That's definitely a plus in my book!
B0001I562I|3.0|I don't know why I loved this movie when I was a kid.  It is so lame.  I'm glad they are remaking it because the original blows.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is fun and was difficult enough to keep my attention but not so difficult to have me move on.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love this book. I find it hard to put down. I wanted to read the books before I watch the series and I'm glad i did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is now one of my favorite games to play! Love it. easy to play and never gets old. Great for any age.
B0036R92V2|1.0|I consider this movie a classic, but the blu-ray edition, I was disappointed, blurring, spots appear at times, you see that was taken based on an original negative or very poor condition, you can not throw something in such bad condition.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Can't stop playing it. I seriously recommend all Jurassic park fans to play and make your own park and play with friends.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|great episode....wish i could have streamed for free seeing as it's a cbs show,,, but oh well<br />thats what dvr is for, right??
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Although kind of boring and not as interactive as i hoped, this game was not bad. My sisters loved so i thought i would give it a shot!
0812550706|5.0|this is a good book<br />bought it years ago when it first came out and loaned to a friend--never to see again<br />wanted to re-read so had to find a paperback copy<br />now hear they're making a movie...go figure :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|enjoyed this game. good challenge each floor increased your mental deduction.  hope there are more floors to complete. made it through 10 very quickly.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I started watching it on my pc, and finished on my ipad. I didn't have to waste time in finding where i left off. Loved amazon streaming and obviously loved the movie.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It is so convenient that I can charge iPad and iPhone in the same time during the trip which is really a time saver. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|On a 1500 mile road trip, made the trip go by very fast.  I usually don't pay for books but I have been considering getting the other 2 in this series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was so happy to finally watch DA on Prime. I finished the entire season in about three days. I was sad with the ending and I'm really hoping that maybe it's one of those tv tricks were this person will actually be alive in Season 4 despite what we saw in the end.<br />Love, love, love, Downton Abbey.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game  is cool. Totally life like. I recommend this others while like games. It never get 's boring or  freezes up y our kindle. Great game to play to pass the time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|If your an Iron Man fan you'll love this game! It's just like Temple Run, but funner... It keeps me entertained....
B00AZM7IQC|2.0|Although I *love* Cirque Du Soleil I assumed this was going to be some kind of a &#34;new&#34; movie.  Well, it was... in a way.  The 3D effects were wonderful... but what &#34;Worlds Away&#34; is, in a nutshell, is a compilation of things from all of their shows put into some kind of a movie form.  I was expecting to see some new acts, etc... but that's now what I got at all.  Too expensive for not having new material IMHO
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I read this book at the request of my grandson.  I found I couldn't put it down.  A good read.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|This was a brilliant addition to the &#34;Comic Book&#34; genre of TV.  I was addicted from the 1st episode.  What a great replacement for some of the other amazing shows that used to be on like Smallville.  Highly recommend &#34;Arrow&#34;.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a very good game,played on expert but had to change a couple times when I got stuck. It is not a short game at all which was a bonus.<br />The story was awesome  totally kept me captivated.<br />You gotta play it.
B00BVVA138|5.0|This album is definitely different than the past few because Howard is gone.  The instrumentals in this album are great.  I love most of the songs on this album.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Hadn't watched this in years - decided to have my 14 and 16 year old watch it with me.  My two younger ones joined in and loved it too!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|really enjoy this app, very cool and accurate and i especially like the hourly feature. its easy to read and look up info.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is the third of these watches that I have purxchased.  I absolutely love them!  Figured I can splurge and get every face color when they're this cheap.  They do exactly what an automatic watch is supposed to; tell the time, show the date, and give you reasonable accuracy without batteries.  A lot of reviewers bemoan the fact that these watches don't share the same accuracy as an Omega or Rolex, but really, what do you expect from a watch that typically sells for under $65.00.  In the 3+ years I have been wearing these I have not noticed any problems with accuracy.  I'm not timing races with them, I'm wearing them to work and at home.  These watches are my everyday, wear-everywhere timepieces.  The green one, in particular, has a great look.  Each color dresses up well with a leather band also.  Highly recommend this watch to any prospective purchasers.
1600243916|5.0|I got this as a gift for my son who is a family man.  He loved it very much and would recommend it himself.
B001EBYMB2|1.0|Seriously, Amazon, really??  Low resolution streaming for &#34;prime&#34; movies?  HA HA HA HA!!  I'm too fraking busy and my time is too flipping important for me to completely WASTE any time watching any content in low res.  You completely missed the mark on this and any movie producer that allows its content to be streamed in this fashion is a FLAMING IDIOT who is devoid of any business sense.<br /><br />Still laughing at the stupidity of low res streaming by &#34;Prime&#34;
B004VMUS9G|5.0|l always seem to sleep threw alarm clocks, even with the different tones on cell having  multiple alarms. with the math problems i no longer turn off the alarm without even waking up.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Really great insight into the agricultural industry.  A lot of it I already knew about, but its always good to get different peoples take on it.
B00A7C9EVM|4.0|Forced to read it by a friend. Once I started I couldn't put it down. a true classic in its own right.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Not a fan of the OZ movies.  Did explain how the wizard came to be.  Good visual effects.  Sound varied too much from way to soft to all of a sudden blaring.
B002361MLA|5.0|I'm always looking for ways to make life simpler and this book really helped me. It provided me with tools and explanations that has moved me forward and it is done in a way that is easy and simple to understand.
B00942G4UA|4.0|Yeah, it's good to know how food is produced and put in supermarket shelf.  Let's try to eat more organic food.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would give this 5stars because I have had subway surfers for 2 years and its the BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. and btw have FUN :-)
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I actually thoroughly enjoy this game. Which does surprise me cause I'm not usually into games like this. I love it.
B00123G51C|5.0|OMG - this is not only an absolutely awesome CD and live recording, but it is sooo inexpensive too!!<br />I finally got Take 5 and fell in love w/ Dave Brubeck.  So when I saw this and listed to the samples, I tried it out.  This is some awesome live music!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I thought this movie would of been much much funnier, I really got bored with it.  I don't think it's worth renting
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I like wizardry stories.  To me, this movie ranks up there with Harry Potter.  I am anxious to see the 2nd part.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it a lot but sometimes it is hard. I cant get past level 5. I wish it would be easier and my smart dad cant even get it
B000V4NX04|5.0|This picture is unique and quite telling about what motivates some &#34;Security&#34; people, and what doesn't. This picture is about real people, and real situations, told in an understated manner. The STASI were some of the most feared security people anywhere on the planet. One report indicates that 1 out of every 3 people in East Germany were informers. You can look at Hitler's Gestapo<br />versus the Communist Stasi--and wonder which organization was BEST at catching spies from foreign nations, trouble-makers,<br />and dangerous people--people that they might consider to be dangerous.  A video game that accurately portrayed both organizations- and compared results--to determine the superior service on each of 20,say,--situations--would be quite interesting.<br /><br />signed/Mr. Davis//Investment Banking M & A.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game I'm addicted to it it's like AWESOME and I love it a lot !!!( make more apps Kiloo ;))
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have to check it all the time, and upgrade as soon as I can, doe the battles and make sure my dragons are all fed.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|To good for your brain shook my awake and it need ed it it's been awhile since I was in school so it was nice to use my brain again . Lol
B008602KQI|3.0|This was too violent for younger audiences..........and too puerile for the adults, but the acting was good and the characters believable.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I've had a hard time in the past getting through Le Carre books, but now I think I should retread earlier ones. I loved this one. It's witty, current, on the mark in so many ways.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its really good for when you're bored and need something to do and its a good game for horse lovers even though the horses are a little weird
B002SAUCBC|4.0|I was walking with these boys from start to finish.  A chilling look at the darker side of humanity and the meaning of survival.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Yes, its great! It is a wonderful show and it is great to watch it whenever and wherever I want.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Fallen Tree Games, and each time they outdo themselves. This time they've done it again. The look of the game is incredible, and fits the series perfectly. The story,combined with the music, creates a truly moving and thoughtful experience. Anyone who loves puzzle games should buy this piece of art.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is great but it needs more guns. It also needs guns from other nationalities. Otherwise it is amazing. worth it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|We enjoyed watching this as a family; I would recommend parents of younger children watch it first, because some of the thematic elements are frightening for children under 12.  Disney always does things best, of course, and never misses the details.  Mila Kunis is wonderful and convincing.  Michelle Williams is great as Glinda.  The little china doll stole the show for me; what a wonderful special effect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is an awesome game. This game is different from other games I played. and you can go to different places like Miami, Paris and others.
0440246318|5.0|This is a quick read simply because it is hard to put down.  The story, though slightly flawed in places, is captivating.  The ending is great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|additive love it very much. one of the best ones yet. my kid like it to.  I. I.  l.over it.
B0095P3ULC|1.0|The plot is minimal and advancing the story line is painfully slow. I sat through the whole thing hoping something would make it great, but it did not. Glad I didn't spend the money to watch it in theaters or rent it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the challenge of this game. It's just complicated enough to be fun but not so difficult you want to quit.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was so excited to read this wonderful writers next book. I loved both the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. Unfortunately this book doesn't hold a candle to his previous work. While I still enjoyed his writing style the story was hard to follow. Their were several characters, as with his previous works, but the relationship between them was hard to follow. I had several unanswered questions even at the end of the book.
B000GCFX36|5.0|I was looking for something funny to read and was surprised to learn about addictions in the process.  This is a great book!!  Most everyone knows someone who has an addiction challenge, whether it be a family member or friend.  This book would be great for anyone addicted to drugs or alcohol or anyone who has someone close that has an addiction to read.  It will open their eyes.<br />I loved the &#34;Dance of the Stolen Car&#34;...I was laughing so hard I was crying!<br /><br />Overall a very insightful book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Like having another piece of technology with me... only no need for the extra unneeded plastic thing. Attractive and readily visible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A very good game makes a lot of fun!!!<br />Ein Super Spiel, wenn man einmal angefangen hat kann man nicht mehr aufh&ouml;ren!
B006T75DUU|5.0|I never would have read this book if it hadn't been required reading in a college class.And my life would have been the poorer for it.<br />  Zen & the art of motorcycle maintenance does not delve that deeply into Zen.Nor does it get down in the weeds very far regarding  motorcycle maintenance.<br />  What this book actually is,is a philosophy book wrapped around the story of a man & his son on a long distance motorcycle trip which becomes a voyage of discovery on several levels.Zen & motorcycle maintenance,are but a couple of the subjects used in an effort by the author in a largely successful attempt to reconcile,among other things,the classic & romantic disciplines of philosophy.You will not view the words values,or quality,the same way ever again.Much of this is a sort of internal dialog of the father as the trip progresses to a conclusion I doubt you will anticipate.<br />  The book is a bit of a challenge & very thought-provoking,but will reward the diligent reader with insights well worth the effort.<br />  And beware,it motivated me to buy a motorcycle & take a cross country trip of my own.I owe this work & its author a debt of gratitude.<br />  Highly highly recommended.
B00C6BACF4|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. You should buy it based on that. Dry British humor is always a win.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I'd seen the movie, but I hadn't read the book yet.  It was a lot more intense than I thought it was going to be.  Definitely glad I read it.
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|This book does nothing but repeat itself over and over and over again until it's blue in the face. The four agreements it states could be easily summed up in one chapter with bulletin points and presented over the course of 5-6 pages in a pamphlet, rather than a whole book (but, where would the author get his money?!) because it would have been easier to understand and not so repetitive.<br />Then, we get into the whole &#34;You HAVE to believe in GOD to appreciate this book.&#34; because he's mentioned on EVERY SINGLE PAGE. And there's nothing for those of us who have other beliefs. If it had not incorporated &#34;god&#34; into every lesson, over and over, I would have had an easier time with the ideas behind it, because they are good ideas. However, this book ends with a few pages of prayer and the word &#34;amen&#34;, which, had it not been on Kindle, would have caused me to throw it across the room for it's assumption that we all have the same beliefs. Actually, I wanted to do this repeatedly throughout the book.<br />I have no problem with people who believe in &#34;god&#34;, but I do have a problem with people who assume it's the only way to think, and the only way to grow as a human being.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I was expecting a little more.  It has considerably fewer items than regular Minecraft.  I enjoy farming and this is definitely not the version for me.  There's nothing TO farm.  I realize that the pocket edition would naturally be more simplified, but I didn't know that it would be to this extent.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love this game when I can actually play...hope they fix glitches... it kicks you out a lot. Lags also
B00005JLEU|4.0|I saw this a few years ago and liked it so much that I decided to buy it (I don't buy many movies, so that's saying something for me).  It's not a gushy Disney cartoon, for sure.  It has themes of courage in the face of crisis, friendship, hard work, and empathizing with others, even if they're not exactly pleasant to be around.  There are some parts that are kind of random (bouncing heads, jumping lamp post), but overall it's a great movie.  Love Miyazaki's films.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|For someone who has no talent it's fun and creative. You can send it to email though it hasn't shown up in mine yet when I sent it. Would like to know if you can print it off.
B007EDZ20O|4.0|I had heard some sketchy things about Mother Theresa before, but only little snippets.  This collects stories from people that worked with her and knew her and illustrates not such a saintly woman who cared about the unfortunate, but someone who believed that physical pain and suffering were a purifying force, not to be interfered with by things like medical treatment or anesthetics.  She spent her donations not on the alleviation of suffering, but to build convents and promote her twisted view of piety.  Hitchens, as usual, is blunt and unforgiving in his analysis.  I like the straightforward manner, but he does take a few cheap shots at her, which is why I knocked it down a star.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Nice to see this book was not a dramatic as the first.  It was a fun read that left you wondering what direction the next book will take.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I love these movies (Clash of the Titans and Wrath of the Titans)  I think they are great movies.  This one was cheap and it came fairly quick.
B008M721MS|1.0|Skype provides an excellent service, but it i s unbelievable that they would release such a terrible update. I'm running kindle fire hd and version 4 is just terrible.
0812982622|4.0|Hard to read a book about the delights of growing up in North Korea, but an imaginative and horrifying story. Not for sissies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love thhis game. the best ever. if you don't have it you're crazy. when you start playing you can't stop.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I found the game to be geared toward those with very early English skills.  On the other hand, I'm completely stumped by how to lock the online purchasing feature.
1592407889|4.0|Although many details in this book required me to adapt a state of non-judgment regarding the truth of Sachi's narrative,<br />I did enjoy the story of her most unconventional lifestyle and parents.  I support Sachi in relating her story and painful moments while continuing to be the fan of Shirley MacLaine that I've been for many years.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The game is a lot of fun and I enjoy playing it, but on my nexus 4 phone, 1 in every 5 times that I play the game, once I exit it, my phone crashes and it reboots... Only does this on this game. Other than that it's a great game.
B005LAII3U|5.0|The director's cut of this film changed and added enough things that it is practically a different movie. It fixed nearly all the problems I had with the theatrical version of the film.
B003K15IF8|2.0|This book should have been titled Loner, not Stoner.  It is a very sad and depressing novel about a young farm boy in Missouri during the early 20th Century who goes to college and becomes an English professor.  I really cannot recommend to anyone unless they are cerebral, bookish, introverted and a loner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome app because one week ago it wasnt free so I love playing this app its so much fun like temple run
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun for me and my 4 &amp; 8 year old grandchildren. This app is good for all ages. Very addictive.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a freaking awesome game. And it's free as well!!!  The upgrades are easy to get and the game is totally addicting. Thanks
B000QCTNIW|5.0|A must read for everyone!  Whether or not you are interested in brain function and change, this book will appeal to you regardless
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Took me a while to get into this one but once I got hooked I couldn't stop reading! One of the best series I've ever read.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|While I did not agree with all of the author's conclusions, I nevertheless thought the book was incredibly well researched and a fascinating and informative read.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|We wanted to watch something fun and chose this.  This is great family intertainment.  As allways, Disney is very clever and can even keep the adults captivated.
B008Y79IUE|5.0|The title of the film says it all. We all have our dreams, but obsession destroys the dream... and the dreamer.
B001ANSS5K|2.0|I was so disappointed with this book.  Mainly, it was because I love John Green and this let me down so much.  This book started out very well.  It sounded lively and cute and it appeared to have good characters.  Note that I said appeared.  As the book moved on it lost all of the things that pulled me into it in the first place.  The plot ended up slowing down to the point where it appeared that it had none.  It seems that John Green decided to fill in the parts where the plot should have progressed with philosophical musings of the main character. This may have appealed to me but a girl can only put up with it for so many dozens of pages.  The characters lost there sparkle too.  The main character, Quentin, became selfish to the point of putting his friend at risk and being self destructive.  He becomes absolutely obsessed with a girl he, for most of the book, has no chance of finding. He looks at everything she may have touched as a clue. Perhaps this was supposed to prove Quentin's love for her, but in reality it is creepy and unhealthy. He over-thinks things and cannot stop talking about the musings of a poet who is ,though good, much too over played when he does nothing to benefit the story.  The  same can be said when he is looking for these paper towns or pseudodivisions. Also, the characters were rather unrealistic. I am all game for a flawed character, not even the people we imagine in our heads can be perfect. However, the characters seem to be written so that the reader wants to be or imitate them because they are so different and unique when all they are is obsessive and unwell. All of the hopes I had  for this book were washed away even though I tried so hard to give it a chance.  I only finished this in hopes I  would get better in the end. Unfortunately, it never did.
B00589BMF0|4.0|I prefer part one,but this one is decent enough to see it,i mean if you've seen part 1 then might as well see part two,i didn't give it 5 stars because it seemed low budget at times especially on the special effects
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I wish it compared your times/scores with other players on the same puzzle. It is well designed and easy to navigate. I like it.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|One of the best syfy movies ever made,Jodie Foster and James Woods totally makes this movie,i'm glad i finally got to see it
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Just wish you did not have to wait so long to get more credits, 24 hrs is a long time,  then you only get enough to play the miner levels. Other than that the qame is great.
B00498XRPE|5.0|A must see for all syfy lovers,a classic that ranks amongst the best alien movies out there,do yourself a favor and check it out
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This series keeps you riveted throughout the different episodes, you identify with the characters and feel their triumphs and losses almost as deeply as if they were friends and family.
B0015DROBO|4.0|So many have given this book praise that I had to read it. The beginning is slow and hard to track with an unending list of characters . About three quarters of the way through the plot began to come together and I couldn't put it down. Well worth putting up with a tedious first half.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I've watched this film many times since its release 20 years ago and I still find it entertaining and inspiring, the classic western in the same league with the John ford films. Duvall and Jones are at heir peak in the performances they gave us.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I WAS LET DOWN THOUGHT THE REVIEWS AND BEST SELLER RATING MEANT IT WOULD BE A DECENT TIME KILLER...I WAS WRONG
0062082353|5.0|I Love to hear and read about true stories that have happened.  Good and bad.  Awesome book and hope for more.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I'm a comic fan from my youth and I like the new franchise.  The actors are who really bring it to life though with their own unique personality for each character.
0802473156|5.0|Another good book.  UI wish I would have found this one a long time ago. The wife loved it too.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The concept in this book...that we each have specific love languages for which can make or break, so to speak, how we feel loved, is awesome and a must read and apply element to help bring out the best in every marriage.
0525953728|5.0|This was a very good book in my opinion.  I really like this type of book as do many others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so cool,the people who don't have this game should get the app in the Appstore and try it out for their self.
1118109791|5.0|I found it very helpful. It's a good study guide for taking GMAT exam. As it is an official guide, you'll see similar passages from the real test.
B008602KQI|4.0|I had never read the books, so maybe I just want as into it, it got really hyped up for me from evoke who had seem it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun addictive game I play it all day long and compete against my friends I suggest everyone to download it .
B008JAGZDE|5.0|This is the best follow up to the first one. All the others inbetween ehh, not so much as funny as first one. This one is funny like the first. Now the American Wedding I liked, it wasn't too bad. Again, not a good follow up to the first one. So if you haven't seen any, See American Pie, then this one only. Then watch American Wedding and you'll be well rounded.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I'VE ONLY HAD KIK FOR A DAY AND I ALREADY LOVE IT. THE SPEED IT DELIVERS AND RECIEVES MESSAGES IS AMAZING, I GOT THE APP BECAUSE I WANTED TO TEXT PEOPLE WITH imessages and they couldn't without kik. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, the only thing is the person you text also has to have a kik!!!<br /><br />GET THIS APP YOU'LL LOVE IT YOUR FIRST TIME TO<br />Kik me at soccernoah14!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this series, doesn't follow a real story from history. It is intriguing and I can't stop watching it. It would be the one and only series I would watch back to back episodes, it's that good.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Game is pretty fun and graphics are great. Game play is a little wanting not in controls but amount of play time to get the suits.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Love this movie, I love Kate Hudson in this movie. Such a true as to what that time was like. I'm sure it was based on a particular band and not just the ere as it comes across. Zoey Deschanel is another good actress in this movie as well.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|I got this one and the first flick gold,plus the football one and the zombies one they got out, they and great and so fun I just want more of them please make more or add ons !!!! Like I said before it reminds me of sitting at the pizza place waiting for my food on the old style flick tv looking scene wit all the games on it ,,,,, just these r fun .
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Not typical but typical. Like the nice twist that it's more the son and he's just kinda helping. Bruce's character was more the comedy part than he'd been before.

B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Loved It. Can't wait for the sequels, not at all like Twilight. A whole new breed of supernatural story that will entice you and make you want more. Husband saw a trailer and said that's different and looked interesting. He doesn't know I already seen this, lol. I will again with him it's that good.

There were more questions than answers in this movie, about the androids true agenda/mission and where did that come from if not the company in the movie??

B004R13U6Y|5.0|I was discouraged when I saw that it was $3.99 and back when I had the Google Nexus I had gotten this same app off of Google Play for only 25cents. So that bothered me. Saying that, It is a definite must have if you plan on reading any PDF files on your kindle. It is pretty amazing. You get more color option backgrounds that you create yourself and just change the setting to use your background. It took me a bit to figure that one out, but once I did, I was able to have a gray background. I do not think there is a PDF reader better than this one. I have tried a lot. I was also able to put my epub files on my Kindle and read them through this app. I was amazed I was able to do that without converting them. The Google Nexus I had used Epub anyways so I didn't realize that I was getting that as a plus. I found out by accident when one of my epub files accidently transferred over to my kindle when I was transferring files. So now, I have all my epubs on here and have read many through this app. You can't change the color backgrounds which is a negative but you can make it large print which is great. But to me it was a PLUS because I didn't know about this when I bought it. I really think this is one of the best apps out there.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I encourage you see Warm Bodies. Why? Because it's a movie that will please even the most hardcore zombie flick fan. But it will also appeal to those who like their movies a little more like something Nicholas Sparks wrote. It's sweet and sappy and full of brain-eating zombies. That's right, Warm Bodies has a little something for everyone.<br /><br />Warm Bodies starts with narration by a young man, who we only know as R (Nicholas Hoult). R has forgotten his name - being a zombie and all - and is just thinking that there has to be more to life than shuffling around the airport, grunting at his best friend M (Rob Corddry) and trying not to lose that last bit of humanity in himself that would turn him into what the thinking zombies (so much as they can think) refer to as Bonies. But then, R meets Julie (Teresa Palmer) after eating her boyfriend and his heart starts beating again - literally.<br /><br />This is the part where you go \\"Eww....\\" and then \\"Awww...\\"<br /><br />I went into Warm Bodies expecting more of a dark comedy. What I did not expect was a heartfelt romance that had me near to tears at times because of its' absolute sweetness. Sure, there could have been funnier moments, but I think the intent of this film was to be a romance. But it's a cool romance and not one of those lame romance movies with Jennifer Anniston, because well, it has zombies. It's marketing genius, it is. The relationship that develops between R and Julie feels reel, even though the circumstances of the film are not. I don't know why, but it works.<br /><br />Perhaps some of that has to do with the acting of Hoult and Palmer. The two have an undeniable chemistry that is so adorable that you'll want to be farting kittens mid-film. It also doesn't hurt that even as a zombie, Hoult is still adorable. His big zombie puppy dog eyes will pull you in and convince you of every word he narrates, even if R's dialogue is limited to monosyllable words.<br /><br />As far as special effects go, the Bonies are actually fairly scary. In fact, the very young boy sitting next to me  started whimpering every time they appeared on screen. That was, obviously, good enough for me. There's also some brain-eating that's both gross and amusing, especially for those of us who are hardcore zombie fans.<br /><br />So yes, I'll admit, the sappy ending of the movie had me in tears. I'm a sucker for a good unconventional romance and Warm Bodies has that in droves. And John Malkovich is in it. `Nuff said.Bonies are actually fairly scary.

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I don't usually watch these kinds of movies anymore, especially remakes, but I happen to think James Franco is handsome, so I did and it sure was different from what I expected. I think if your into James Franco you should give it a watch. Hes always entertaining and funny. Good actresses, good special effects. Made me watch.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I went into Mama with high expectations. I've always been a fan of pretty much anything that Guillermo Del Toro's name has been attached to, and did not think Mama would be any different. And it lived up to the quality guarantee that Del Toro set way back with The Orphanage. Mama is obviously scary at times, but it also has those emotional moments that most horror films lack.<br /><br />The premise of Mama is about two girls who get abandoned in the woods after their father leaves them in a cabin there. Right off the bat, we discover that the girls didn't get left alone, as there's an entity of some sort living there with them. Five years later, the girls are found, and as these stories go, the entity moves into their new home with them.<br /><br />Mama is one of those movies that starts out dark and terrifying. The two little girls, at first, are about as creepy as raised-in-the-woods-by-a-monster children can be, but as the movie progresses, they - along with the entity that accompanies them - start becoming more recognizable as human. And that's where the beauty of Mama lies - in learning about the entity and why she has become the thing that she is. She's still scary, but by the end of the film, you feel empathy for her, too.<br /><br />There are also some very unique and original elements in the making of Mama as well. For example, the use of what seems to be old film footage to show scenes set in the past are used in a way I had not seen before. It helps set the tone between the past and the present and when the past melds back into the present, the effect used is something I'd never seen before. It's hard to describe (especially since I don't have a film degree), but it's very cool. And considering the present obsession with the same old tired tricks in horror films today, it's a refreshing change of pace.<br /><br />Mama also boasts a pretty talented cast. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister, as most of us know him from Game of Thrones) portrays the uncle, Lucas, that is now taking care of the girls (he also plays the girls' father).  He is convincing as an artist (and possibly a little bit of a slacker) who wants nothing more than to do right by his brother's daughters.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain, one of Hollywood's new \\"it\\" girls, is brilliant as Lucas girlfriend. Her role is much more pivotal as she becomes a new mother figure for the girl, which means she is forced to suffer the wrath of the monster. What I loved about her character is that she's still as rough around the edges (she's in a rock band, for example), up until the end of the film. She stays true to the character. There's no major \\"I need to grow up and be responsible now\\" moment (I hate those anyway). She  does realize that she loves the girls, but she's still true to herself.<br /><br />Megan Charpentier and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse portray the two children believably. And if that's them doing the creepy wild animal-like crawling on all fours at the beginning of the film, major kudos (that has to be CGI, right?). They go from being scary creatures themselves to fully realized human beings.<br /><br />Mama is not a gore-fest or a jump-out-at-you scarefest. It is not a found footage film. It is one of those wonderful stories that just happens to be creepy during its telling. But it becomes even more than that and there's probably a good chance you'll need tissues before you exit the theater., Lucas, that is now taking care of the girls (he also plays the girls' father).

B001ZG4J00|5.0|After watching &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; and being blown away by Rodriguez's lyrics, personality and music, I downloaded Cold Fact and Coming from Reality. You will not be disappointed. Like listening to James Taylor, Jim Croce and Bob Dylan all at once but with a little more edge and grit than any of them. The bonus track &#34;Slip Away&#34; is simply excellent. It makes me smile all over that the man is once again on tour this summer to sold out concerts.
1476734941|5.0|This diet is easy to stay on and really works!<br /><br />I didn't have much to lose:  I started at 97.5 kilos and wanted to get to 92 (I'm 195 cm tall.  As an athlete in college, I was about 90 kilos and my future wife thought I was way too skinny).<br /><br />By my third week, I was consistently below 94 kilos and it was totally painless.<br /><br />The biggest thing it did for me was show me how much I was overeating.  Even after eating only 600 calories on a fast day, I went to bed satisfied.  On feast days, I often go to bed feeling really full and wake up feeling full the next day.  Now, I really think about it when I feel like a second helping, and realize I'll feel better later if I resist.<br /><br />I'm in my fourth week now and yet to get below 93 kilos, but I can easily see myself continuing the Fast Diet indefinitely.  I also look forward to my next blood test to see if the purported benefits there pan out (LDL's getting a little high).<br /><br />One HUGE warning though:  Don't take my use of the term \\"feast days\\" literally.  After a fast, it can be very painful to overindulge.

I have had 4 other family members borrow and read it and it has been unanimously enthusiastically received.  It is a bit on the spooky side, but I gave it to my 13 year old daughter and she loved it as well and didn't find it too scary.  It is a shorter story, like a novella, but a great read.

1616614609|4.0|I love this game! The strategy is deep and the extra packs keeps it fresh and interesting. My only complaint is that the base set has a few cards that are limited in count. Where as it's legal by the rules to have 3 of any given card in your deck some cards are only present in counts of one or two in this base set. If you get really serious about this game you may find your self contemplating buying this three times!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I wanted to read the next page almost to the end of the book. Lots of suspects along the way. And best twist in recent memory.<br />Ending was just OK...probably because it couldn't possibly live up to the expectations set by what came before it
B0045HCJRQ|1.0|This film has a pretty big fan base.  My wife belongs to it, which is shocking to me since she's not really one to embrace the period films and so her adoration of this particular film is baffling to me, especially since I tend to love this genre and I absolutely hate this film.  Stilted due to poor pacing issues and numbing due to absurdity, `Sommersby' offers up an intriguing premise and some provoking themes but fails to tie them together or flesh them out in a way that feels substantial and influential.  Instead, the film's lack of true character and the abominable performances by some in the central cast cause me to shake my head in aggravation.  Jodie Foster is very good here, but she can't carry this film all on her own.  Pullman is horrific and Richard Gere struggles to present his character to the audience.  At the end of the day, `Sommersby' is a beautifully shot bore of a film that really should be avoided at all costs.<br /><br />Feel free to disagree with me.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The first book was so good you want to know what happens next. Sadly this one is not as good as number one. Number three is better.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|If you took `Get Shorty', fused it with `Wild at Heart' and had Quentin Tarantino direct it, you'd have `True Romance'.  In fact, I'm really shocked that Tarantino didn't chose to direct this himself, since he wrote the screenplay and places him fingerprints all over it.  Even Tony Scott, who has his own energetic style of filmmaking, nearly channels Tarantino on every frame.  Maybe that's why this is Scott's finest film (at least from what I've seen), but either way this is one of those cult classics that deserves the status it has attained.<br /><br />Pop culture references, black comedic timing, dire dramatic intensity, brutal violence and fantastical influxes coat this film and help create a unique and engaging atmosphere that thrives with every passing frame.<br /><br />Telling the story of loner Clarence who hooks up with Alabama Whitman, a hooker with a heart of gold, `True Romance' takes us on a modern day Bonnie and Clyde type adventure.  After Clarence murders Alabama's pimp and flees with stolen drugs, the two decide to sell the coke to a movie producer with a nose for drugs and falls into the path of vengeful drug dealers looking for their merchandise.  Throw in some FBI agents on their tail and you have a recipe for extreme violence and a large body count.<br /><br />The cast is flawless.  Seriously, from the two leads (Slater and Arquette are fantastic) to the ridiculously cluttered ensemble, everyone is at the top of their game.  Hopper, Gandolfini (R.I.P.), Oldman, Walken and Rubinek are all scene stealers, building so many layers with mere moments on screen (Hopper and Gandolfini are especially effective and literally own this film).  Tony Scott handles the movement of the plot with a contained chaos, adding a graceful quality to the flow of events, and the cinematography is a beautiful element all its own, transporting us to each scene with progressive integrity.  From the rich soundtrack to the bounty of colors and passionate performances, `True Romance' is as real as it gets and one of those magical films that defines what cinema is all about.omance' is as real as it gets and one of those magical films that defines what cinema is all about.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed playing this. Lots of fun. Level 10 was hard, had to cheat a little by looking at youtube.
B000AARKW6|3.0|When I first saw `Carlito's Way' I thought that it was the sequel to `Scarface'.  I don't know why I felt that was important to share with you, since it really isn't at all, but whatever.  The films, while sharing similarities in certain aspects (theme and director mostly) are very different animals altogether and so their shared aspects become null and void really.  Here, Pacino plays an ex-convict trying to turn his life around who becomes involved with a lawyer bent on getting in with the crowd Carlito is trying to avoid.  The plot points are hit in a very rudimentary fashion, never truly unearthing anything original or inspired.  It felt like a formulistic plot stylized in a very common way.  This is the issue with many of De Palma's films, sadly.  Since he is so inspired by others he never really becomes his own and so many of his films fail to have a true identity.  There are exceptions to this rule (`Carrie' and `The Phantom of the Paradise' stick out as truly inspired and masterful works) but as a rule I find his films lacking in originality.  `Carlito's Way' is a decent film, but outside of a few sight tricks (that hospital scene is still nerve wracking and intense) and Sean Penn's brutally intense and brilliant portrayal of a coked out lawyer, the film never surprised me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! I only wish it weren't so hard to get the rainbow unicorn or the zebra ( ; I really do like<br />this game though. If only these horse's were real I feel like they are really a part of me!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Will u please give me more coins I could really US some and would greatly appreciated it and could really use them
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you've read any of the 50 Shades books you will enjoy reading this. I feel this book was well written and less repetitive than 50 Shades.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I can not get past level 5.  I was never very good at math. Lol. If any one can help me,send the formula to skyra85572@aol.com.  I would like to keep playing.  Thank you
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book. I found Amy & Nick to be quite the pair! Reminded me of some people I know.
1401937268|5.0|My Tarot cards were ok for now been thinking of what to buy next. Checking out at www.amazon.com and buying a lot of stuff at that site.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Way fun app. This app helps get me through my boring job. I used to think people who played magic were weird turns out I was the weird one for thinking that.
B009DH372Y|5.0|The extras were spread throughout the concert, which was unusual, and very fun.  Candid looks at all the members.  Any Queen lover will cherish this DVD!
B00CEF014E|5.0|This was the first time I have read this author and I am greatly impressed! This story caught me right from the start and I didn't put it down until I finished. I am looking forward to reading more from this author!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie - Phillip Seymour Hoffman is one of my favorite actors.  But this movie was painful to watch.  Joaquin Pheonix's character was not a pleasant person, and I found it  difficult to watch him struggle through his life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is incredibly well written. Absolutely loved how the story ended knowing it was their beginning of a freed life for Christan and Ana. It's a story that I'll never forget.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|It did take me a bit to warm up to this, and I appreciated being able to &#34;rewind&#34; the movie and watch some parts over - some story lines move quite fast.  I found that this was a movie that stayed on my mind for days - I love that!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I must confess that I could NOT read this book in public due to the many face expressions I pulled while reading this book. Just WOW. Even though the other two books are better this one is just... raw, which makes it just \\"special\\".
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is my husband's watch.  He really likes the appearance and the quality of it.  It is his  &#34;watch of the year&#34;.

B006ZZANG0|5.0|love this cd. the words are so that I can understand them. saw rufus on jay leno. I play it all the time
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I thought this game was a smash hit for my cousin and sister. Overall, I love the way the game was designed, I gave the player a chance to interact with the game a bit more. I also thought it was fun for kids of all ages and its deserves a 5 star rating because it was just that awesome of a game.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Clapton is at his best on this one. so many good ones. listen to samples and you will see what i'm talking about.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Great comic.  Some parts are a bit bland. Overall, it's a good one and I'm looking forward to reading the rest!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|needs to have a hint when needed, got to level 6 and got stluck,  Just learning the Kindle so haven't found all the goodies yet.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|I've always loved CCR and always known that John Fogerty was CCR, so when I heard about this project on Sirius XM listened to a few of the songs, I had to have it.  What a great bunch of songs and teamed up with rock and country greats for the duets works out very well.  I think only &#34;Lodi&#34; didn't measure up, but loved the rest of it.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|I was fascinated by this when I first saw it as a boy. I love the characters and the themes (music) that Sergio Leone gave each major character. Love how it and the characters parts unfolded, particularly Charles Bronson and Fonda. Worth studying as a student.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I am a real Baldacci fan having read everything he has written.  Always entertaining and excellent for story and character development.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was fricken awesome oh yeah I loved it more than my favourite shirt you should go read this book

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awesome game would recommend to everyone great way to pass the time. Love competing with friends on Facebook. Good way to pass time or relax with in the evening.
B000003RCY|5.0|With exception to a few songs, this CD is pure adrenaline!<br />Der Meister - One of my favorite songs now!<br />I could go on, but why, buy it, you won't regret it!<br />Give your stereo a workout!!!
B00847KFDS|5.0|Really one of the best collections of both CCR and post CCR ever and even more enhanced by the contributuons of the guest singers.
B007SGM084|2.0|I really don't care for this book. I found it difficult to get started reading Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy.
B008966SLM|2.0|It's not news Cray has been campaigning for Pres. Obama. But a song from Ovama's perspective is too much. Then there's a lament of the poor union worker whose job was outsourced. These theme's would be tolerable if the music wasn't so dull - Twenty and Time Will Tell are good albums regardless of the commentary on the Iraq war. This is Cray's second mediocre album in a row. I would give it three stars on the music but the politics drops it to two. On a side note, I saw RCB perform two years ago. Best show ever.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|As a lover of hidden object games, I thought that this one was great. It had good graphics and good gameplay.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am using this app on Kindle Fire HD.  It has been accurate and easy to use. I especially like the forecasts of what's coming in the days ahead - really good for planning. Also, being able to see other locations is quite helpful.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|The movie was really slow in the beginning, so much so that we would have turned it off but our friend wanted to watch it. Once it got started it was okay but it definitely wasn't made for kids. My husband and our friend pretty much said that it was a cartoon version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas... So parents of young children be aware.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Unconventional presentation of the most conventional advice you'll ever get. This is a book for all time. Read it and you'll see.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|What a wonderful book! I hated for it to end! I would highly recommend it.  The author does an awesome job of beautifully blending past and present.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|its fun and relates to the movie. something new and interesting. I like that its not linked to facebook and I can play how I want to
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|Just when Gru (Steve Carell) is getting used to single parent life with the three girls he adopted, he's offered a job as a spy. His new partner is Lucy (Kristen Wigg) who has as much of a love for gadgets as Gru.<br />  Together they are undercover at the mall at a bakery to find who is turning animals into blue monsters. There Gru suspects Eduarado (Benjamin Bratt), the owner of a Mexican restaurant of being a former villain named El Macho. While someone is taking Gru's hilarious Minions!<br />  Gru bonding with a woman instead of the kids is smarter than just giving us a similar story all over again. While I laughed a lot and there was plenty of charm but in the end I felt it could have been a little longer since the story could have been just a bit stronger. Just like Monster University, Despicable Me 2 isn't Oscar worthy and I was really hoping it would be. In the end though, I still love Minions and want one!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Brings back old memories of playing game when I was a kid. Very fun, without all the book keeping, and keeping track of things.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|it's good but when the update came I couldn't play it anymore it said I needed to get rid of 256 MB. from my kindle storage and i deleted 25 apps 8 or 9 books and I still can't play.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|: great game challenging and fun.  great to pass the time on long trips would recommend to anyone over the age of 13.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was going to give this book a four star rating until the very last chapter. Colleen Hoover knows how to end a book with pure perfection. She's both a poet and novelist, and the seriously emotional topics she touches on in Hopeless are delivered with such finesse that I suspect Hoover would also make a fine psychologist. While the book didn't have me flipping pages at quite the same break-neck speed as her Slammed series, it still provided a tremendous amount of entertainment. Great for a wide range of ages, there are few women readers whom I wouldn't recommend this book to. Can't wait for the sequel!
B007SGM084|5.0|Makes you think about other choices to make your marriage better and more fun.  Gives your husband a since that he rules...lol.
B00BTV62KG|4.0|\\"&Uuml;berjam Deux\\" is an eclectic journey into improvisational rock. Having played with [[ASIN:B000HKDEJM Medeski Martin & Wood]] and [[ASIN:B000H7J9UI Phil Lesh & Friends]], John Scofield has stretched-out with the giants of the jam world. Naturally, Scofield improvises all the time but this is his self-appointed jam project. As would be expected, 'Dub Dub' is reggae. It features keyboard work by [[ASIN:B00AYQHPNA John Medeski]] who plays a supportive role on this album. 'Cracked Ice' turns the funk factor all the way up. As with its predecessor, this project is also infused with some electronica. Specifically, 'Endless Summer' and 'Torero' use electronic drums, synthetic sounding keyboards and tripped out base lines that allude to technotronic jambands like [[ASIN:B000EQ5QD6 the Disco Biscuits]]. On top of it, 'Torero' even sounds a bit like a remixed version of [[ASIN:B00BPOYRP4 Thelonius Monk]]'s 'Bemsha Swing.'  In contrast, 'Al Green Song' is pure soul and 'Snake Dance' is played with an afrobeat groove. 'I Just Don't Want To Be Lonely' will make anybody's head bop with a giant smile. All in all, this disc makes for one fun listen. John Scofield's guitar work is in as fine a form as ever. Like sonic sunshine, his signature sound is all over this puppy. As with most studio jam music, there is a sense that this material might sound better live. Comparatively, this release may not match the artistry of albums like \\"[[ASIN:B0009299KQ That's What I Say]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000088SS3 Up All Night]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000UYX4UY This Meets That]].\\" That said, \\"[[ASIN:B00005RTDC &Uuml;berjam]]\\" and \\"&Uuml;berjam Deux\\" are in a dead heat with the primary difference being that the sequel is more eclectic. Thanks to this new album, we can once again hear the John Scofield Band rock out.
B002IPG400|3.0|This is not my favorite book by Jane Austen, but it was enjoyable to read.  As I have seen the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow several times, it was easy to follow the story along in my head. I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys Austen's work.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love this album.  Had never heard of the band until I heard them on TV.  I'll be watching for more from them.
1567184855|5.0|This book is very thought provoking and I highly recommend it. It's a different view of the afterlife and I find it amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging app. I enjoy playing with my 9 year old daughter.  Wish there was more!
B009CG29RK|5.0|Great family show with great animation. Awesome comedy and highly recommend for all even if animated movies are not your thing.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|I am extremely disappointed and annoyed by this inferior quality FINIS product - Netpune.<br /><br />It turned outright dead after 12 uses only!<br /><br />The Neptune did not respond regardless how long the power button is pressed or any other button is pressed. This is performed when the USB cable is detached.<br /><br />The Neptune did not charge or show any sign of charging with USB cable attached to it and another end attached to computer USB port,  5V USB power adaptor or likewise.<br /><br />As an electronic engineer myself, I came to pronounce it totally dead after these careful diagnosis.<br />The huge problems ensue:<br /><br />.I will loss at least 20-30 days for the replacement. The summer suitable for swimming is short and is quickly running out. This is extremely annoying.<br /><br />.I am in Hong Kong. I have already paid Amazon USD15 postage upon purchase and it took 10 days for the product to reach me.<br /><br />. Now I need to pay USD50 courier charge to return it for replacement and it would take another 20-30 days?!<br /><br />Why does FINIS produce such an inferior quality annoying product?!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Kept me guessing until the last page. Everytime I thought I knew, there was a twist. Funny thing is, I don't normally read this type of book but the except was wonderful and it grabbed me from page one. Fast read.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This pool arrived and was exactly what I expected to receive when I placed the order.  So far it has held 100% of the air that I put in it two days ago.  That's pretty impressive for anything inflatable.  I do recommend at least a 'high volume' hand pump, or preferably an electric inflation pump like I used.  Don't think you're going to blow this pool up with your lungs.  Although it's not really apparent or obvious from the product information (at the time that I ordered), but the pool does come with three (3) pretty nice inflatable toys.  I have an eight year old and he loves the toys.  I think it was all a pretty good deal for the money and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|If this CD does nothing else it just reinstates what I've always said Joe is and always will be \\"That Guy\\". I own all of his CDs and do not regret purchasing any of them. Joe is good, bad and sexy. This CD delivers and soothes the soul.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Can't believe she watched the whole thing. She's two and she doesn't sit for anything. Like father like daughter I suppose.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app; so easy to use. Love it on my Kindle Fire and on my Galaxylll. Clearly performs better than all others. I appreciate the alerted too!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My son watches this over and over again. Even though he knows what is going to happen he still laughs out loud!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Lovely graphics for this category of game, and I just love Jurassic Park so it caught my attention really quick when I came across it. You get a soft intro to the game and a fast start. Boy, if you are into these sort of Sim-Cityish games, it will set its hooks into you solid. I certainly do enjoy spending a few minutes on this game here and there.
B00136JS12|5.0|What can I say....every cut is a hit and the album is a classic.  Great rock and roll from Boston!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Every single one of the three  -  great reads.  I loved Eva's character, and Cary, but most of all it's Gideon himself that draws you into these tales.  Full of plot twists, hawt steamy scenes.  This book will keep your interest right through to the end of the third book!
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Having live in Memphis for a few years I can appreciate his selection of songs as well as the musicians on this album.  All have been proven over the years as top notch.  His voice and guitar are as good as ever.  I am looking forward to seeing him in Boone, NC later this month to hear him sing a lot of this new album.  I got it on Amazon as an MP3 for $5.00!  Talk about a bargain!  If you like Boz at all, you will not be disappointed with this album.
B00846REIS|5.0|What an alpha male lead character - Gideon Cross is hawt!  I loved all of the characters and storyline.  And this book is just the beginning!  When I finished the trilogy I sat back down and read all three again - they were that good!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I usually do not write a review, but this book deserve one from me.<br />It deserves to have a five stars minimum. I would give it more stars if I could, but since only five is allowed, I give it my five stars.<br />Nalini outdid herself with this book. I had expected something like that, but it is more than my wish. it seems like every once in a while, Nalini write a book that makes me fall in love with the Psy-Changeling series all over again. I do not regret the price of the book as it was worth it. Thank you Nalini for Kaleb story. I suspected him to be the Ghost, and also the child that helped during the train crash, but I didn't know the extent of all his power. Now I cannot wait to see what will happen since the fall of Silence. I can only wonder if the next book will be as good as the previous one. I can see that this series will forever have a lot of surprises, and I thank you for that.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I love David Tennant and Martha Jones, but I dislike Donna. She is my least favorite companion, except for her last episode when the Doctor makes that unforgettable comment about her and the Ood. I don't want to spoil anything for people who have not seen the episode so I leave it at that.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|It was just ok.  I kinda wished that I had the time back from watching it.  It wasn't funny and the action scenes were boring.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Torchwood is an excellent spin off or Dr Who. It is a more &#34;adult&#34; version with many tie-ins to the DR Who main story line following Captain Jack Harkness and crew. If you like Dr Who then you should look into Torchwood.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it. Great mind challenge  it not too hard you give up.  I am addicted and will share with my friends friends and family.  Great entertainment
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I've read Shakespeare. I've read Dante. I've read Cervantes. I've read Austin and Bronte and Tolkein and C.S. Lewis. I've read Twain. I've read the Bible. But I've never been more excited, inspired and entertained than by this book. Maybe I'm just a lonely, lost \\"gringo Indio\\" like Caballo. But when I read this book I felt my heart, soul and body align in rare unity. I'm going to do this. I will run until it feels good.
B00004XPPK|5.0|I love watching these movies with my mom, the oldies we share of love for them. Covergirl is another wonderful movie. These movies are so nostalgic.

B001I5M9SC|5.0|Magnificent! I could do without some of the guest artists singing or playing on their own (without Andrea), but there is enough of Andrea to make this a &#34;must hear&#34; concert! Definitely worth the cost of the disk!
B0081336FO|5.0|I love it!  It is a great show, great characters, great suspense!  Everything is so great!  I can not wait until season three comes out!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game but wish there were more levels. I cant wait for the new updates &amp; hope they come soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a great game I really enjoy it  I am addicted to it it is a lot of fun
B0094K1K8I|2.0|I hate movies that are first person as looking through the viewfinder, that said it had some good parts but mostly bad.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This app is great! It teaches you how to plat the songs but the catch is there aren't THAT many songs. and it should make you plat that many keys at the same time . maybe autoplaying them would be helpful. But apart from that it's a great deal!  8-)
B007HXL1V0|1.0|(Review from Jeff Noren's wife) I was feeling overwhelmed with nesting instinct as I am 8 months pregnant with my second daughter. There isn't much to be done to prep for her as we decided to have our two kids close together, so we have most baby items already out in use in our home. I figured a good use of my stirring brain would be to read some books about sibling interaction (being that I myself am an only child.) Maybe it was the hormones but I found the book extremely horrifying and harsh towards the dynamic of siblings. In fact, I felt like if the authors COULD have just told those parents to only have one child, they would have. It's put me into an emotional tailspin and I feel absolutely lousy now. Plus I feel no wiser to how to deal with my girls, which of course was the ultimate goal.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This is a fun game to play alot interactions an levels of play. It's nice cause it not the same limited Mobil game.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|works great. I like the fact that you can use it as a clock as well as an alarm clock. It also lets you see weather
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Amazing acting and so many great insights on aging. This is a very uplifting movie which leaves one with a positive attitude toward growing older. Not for the teens who want all sex and explosions, but for baby boomers and those who are contemplating getting older and those who deal with older parents. It is a a very real, honest film with great actors as well as real musicians who actually live at Beeker House. I will watch this at least 3 more times! I love the fact that several of the people in the film are not really actors but retired musicians and singers.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|i thought it was a great game till I got to level 6, plus 4 others that were playing, with no clues or hints,  its makes you mad,  waste of time
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the kindle fire and this is the best app ever.as for updates my tablet automatically gets each update if I'm connected to Wi-Fi.I have a 3year old sister who's always asking to play minecraft.<br />One thing I'll say is to never get the free version it doesn't get updates and is terrible.if you get minecraft get the full version.<br />  P@8

B0094BB4TW|3.0|This is a good app but it doesn't have the same things you would have on the web like the feelings thingy ..yeah it doesn't have that maybe you should keep up what the web Facebook has and edit on this app<br />! =)
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Had a good time watching this.  The zombies were fast and really creepy.  Brad Pitt is very good as is the rest of the cast.  I hope they make another.  Very thrilling and I found myself on the edge of my seat quite a few times.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I picked this up on Kindle at a good price and word of mouth.  It is the first book that I've read by Mr. Gaiman.  I find the imagination and the work put into the setting to be quite impressive and enjoyable.  The story was good, clipped along at a nice pace, and I was finished with it rather quickly.<br /><br />However, there is nothing particularly artful about Mr. Gaiman's language, nothing about his approach that transcended me in the way that great fiction does.  It was fine, but my test for a new (to me) author goes something like this:  Did I finish the book?  If not, 1-2 stars, if so, 3-5.  Will I seek out more works by this writer?  If so, 4-5 stars, if not, 3 stars.  So..... that is where I am at with Mr. Gaiman.  It was a good tale, but not good enough to make me want to read more of his work.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Amazing. Very 70ish throwback, not the typical techno. I enjoy every single song on this album. Most of the time the singles are good but the rest is filler, not in this case.
1401937519|5.0|I found the book very well written and edited. It reads easily and, although many points are reiterated several times, not boring or repetitive. To me it seems to be a first class effort and my only suggested improvement would be to have some of the actual medical reports or transcripts to  further substantiate the author's actual recovery from cancer. That said, the book still stands well on its own and raises some points to ponder regarding established religious dogma  and spiritualism. I truly enjoyed reading it and will not hesitate recommend it  to selective friends who are open minded and receptive to other points of view - hard to find people like that though!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Because I like horses a lot. It is fun to feed and brush them and jump.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|It was good but not what I expected - it was mostly Beth Hart and a lot less of Joe which is what we really wanted.  Not horrible mind you but not Joe
159463176X|4.0|What I loved about this book was that it tells the tales as they happened. No sugarcoating. At the same time the stories and characters are moving and emotional.<br /><br />Mr. Hosseini, if you read this, I would love to know how much of this book is based on real stories and what those stories are...<br /><br />The chapter on Mr. Markos was a little remote from the flow of the whole story, otherwise it would be five stars.
1250007208|4.0|This is a reread for me and I loved it more the second time around. Cinder was a great read and amazing set up to the series. It was fun to read about something so familiar yet brand new. The plot doesn't seem much until you get towards the end when things are revealed that leave you blown away. The characters were amazing! I grew so attached to Cinder that I worried for the people she did even if I wasn't too impressed with that character at the time (Prince Kai). I felt strongly about all the characters. Some I loved, others I wished would fall off a cliff and more that grew on me throughout the book. Overall I definitely recommend this book especially to fairytale/sci fi lovers.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show will totally draw you in! The writing, the acting , the story lines -- great TV!<br />Can't wait for Season 3 to start!!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I really don't like reading book reviews that summarize the book, discuss characters, and reveal key plot points.  For me, this is unnecessary.  All I really want to know is if you liked the book, if it was a page turner and if you didn't, what issues did you have with it. Having said that, here is my review:<br /><br /> A friend suggested this book, and I really had no idea what it was about.  At first blush, it seemed to read like a re-imagining of the Scott Peterson's murder of his wife, Lacy.  So in the beginning, I was rolling my eyes a bit, because the story seemed oh so familiar-- but then comes the switch, and with this unexpected twist, this book becomes compelling.<br /><br />The author writes in a manner that is smooth and flowing, and the plot moves right along.  There may not be flowery descriptive prose here-- but sometimes, that can be a distraction.  If you pick up this book, and believe that you already know where it is going, wait a minute--keep reading.  You'll be glad you did.
0062014102|5.0|Yes indeed. A good one to have in the personal library for sure. I'm only half way through the book and seeing the world in a new light.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|We say Shania in Las Vegas a few months ago and she is still at the top of our charts.  Great music and big heart!
1847376460|5.0|I recommend Daniel Yergin's book to anyone interested in the oil business. It should be required reading for everyone beginning work in any aspect of the energy industry.  I have multiple copies and hand one to every new hire. The only complaint I get is that it leaves them short on sleep because they can't put it down.  It is a real credit to Yergin's style and storytelling ability that a nearly 900-page history can be such a compelling read.  My only complaint is that I somehow managed to lose my signed copy in the process.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Excellent cast<br />Excellent acting<br />Good Script<br />Good music<br />A must for fans of Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was very fun. I was able to finish it. I hate games you can't finishing because they are so impossible. 5 stars easy for this game.
B00BY1F8UQ|2.0|I can see why it took this long to publish this CD, them at there worst, and these are great artists
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Very Hard at times to watch, but a true Family Love Story. The acting was wonderful & the story heart breaking. Worth the watch!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can't believe the book ended the way it did!!!! Great novels so far but sometimes I get a little overwhelmed with all the drama between them!! Can't wait till the next book comes out!!!
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|If you're a fan of r&b music and have been disappointed by the genre the past few years, you must get this album. I've been a fan of Joe basically since day one- I've been listening to this guy for nearly 20 years now. He's always had talent, but it takes time to refine, hone, and grow talent into focused, disciplined, mature art. If you listened to his \\"signature\\" album four years ago, it was an unveiling- a Joe with talent, depth and polish you probably hadn't realized he had. This album builds on everything he accomplished with that album, yet is more focused, disciplined and polished. In a phrase, this album is \\"state of the art\\" in terms of being the zenith of current r&b talent. Granted that in itself isn't saying a whole lot- this genre has been lost and confused since the late 90's. But, Joe is calling on classical influences in finding his own sweet spot and setting the standard for what r&b music should embody right now. I can't say enough how impressive it is to see how far Joe has come in his career- a talented young player with swag become refined and polished enough to be the standard bearer of the genre. \\"Easy,\\" once heard will be the r&b track of the genre. His comfort and mastery of the emotion involved in this song is simply breathtaking. The landmark album of the 2000-2009 era was D'angelo's \\"Voodoo\\" album. This decade? This album is an easy early pick. More food for thought- if you followed Marvin Gaye early in his career you know he started out in the 50's doing doo wop stuff, then went on to be the godfather of modern r&b. Joe started out as a talented young player following the crowd in the New Jack Swing era and has emerged as the one singular talent that could very well save the genre. Think about it.
B007N85POS|5.0|Fun for my grandson and others.  luv the bright colors and challenges. sometimes a lil bit hard for him to manipulate equipment but he tries.  well done!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is the best weather app I've seen. I've tried others but hands down this is the best. Oh yeah.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I have never before heard such an interesting mix of dub step-style and classic sounding violin. She is a very talented woman.

B00454U1NS|5.0|this is a great collection of the greats. I am a huge fan and love her music, so this purchase was a no brainer and I have no regrets.
B000001E18|5.0|Nothing about Zooropa is ordinary or expected. Just the packaging alone looks like it's from another world: the astronaut baby, the EU-style stars, the bright colors, and the hidden titles of unused songs in the background make the cover my favorite and an eye-catching presence. If Achtung Baby was the dark subway ride then Zooropa is the emergence into the bustling European nightlife. The title track itself opens the record methodically, with nearly two minutes of quiet piano and the sound of various commercials and broadcasts fading in and out, almost as if someone is trying to get decent reception on their radio. Eventually a voice begins to ask \\"What do you want?\\" and The Edge's effects-laden guitar begins to fade in. From there it's a thrilling trip from the launch pad to the stars. Bono's words seems to echo the theme of the entire album:<br /><br />Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright<br />Uncertainty can be a guiding light<br />I hear voices, ridiculous voices<br />Out in the slipstream<br />Let's go, let's go overground<br />Take your head out of the mud baby<br /><br />She's gonna dream up the world she wants to live in<br />She's gonna dream out loud<br />She's gonna dream out loud<br /><br />It paints a world where any and everything is possible, yet it may not always be predictable or even beneficial. This is the headspace that Zooropa occupies. You don't have to know where you're going. You only have to be willing to move.<br /><br />The opening chimes of \\"Babyface\\" give the song a more airy and upbeat sound, yet Bono's words depict something a bit more sinister, relating to a man who watches footage of a woman endlessly and becomes hypnotized by it. This was at a time when the Internet was in its infancy but already the band sensed that it would become a tool for good as well as the seedier shades of society. The age of Internet porn may have just been emerging but it wasn't hard to see where it would lead. \\"Numb\\", with lead vocals by The Edge, features a droning delivery about too much information and technology's ability to leave us numb after constant overloads. It's trippy and wonderfully bizarre, not to mention the music video is ridiculously strange and entertaining. However, it's \\"Lemon\\" that completely shatters expectations. Its groovy melody and Bono's falsetto delivery that make it a seven minute wonder. Fans love this track and it's easy to see why. It remains a masterpiece of epic proportions and one of U2's most daring compositions.<br /><br />While the album certainly carries a heavy atmosphere of experimentalism it also retains a couple songs more reminiscent of the band's signature sound. The gorgeous \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\" and the gentle \\"The First Time\\" both tell great stories and feel a bit more familiar. \\"Stay\\" is a sombre tale of watching someone you care about take abuse and the feeling of helplessness that comes from being unable to help. It's been a favorite of mine since the first time I head it and time hasn't changed that fact in the slightest. \\"The First Time\\" tells the story of the Prodigal Son, only this time he refuses to come home in the end. Bono's genius for words is all over this record and they can be applied to spiritual, physical, emotional, or political matters. As is usually the case with U2, the listener writes their own interpretation and bonds with it in their own unique way.<br /><br />Larry gets the chance to show off some great drumming and programming on \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\". It allows Bono to do some playful storytelling while reminding us of reckless and spoiled people we know (or may even be ourselves). Adam's bassline gives \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\" a serious kick and it contains the only guitar solo on the entire album, a fuzzy riff from Edge that roars from the speakers and sounds unlike anything you can imagine. The lack of his trademark chiming guitar and his use of unconventional effects makes Zooropa hardly recognizableas a U2 effort but that's also one of its biggest strengths. Those looking for something completely different will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The record closes with \\"Dirty Day\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\". The former really lifts off in the chorus and includes some pensive sayings in the style only Bono can deliver, while \\"The Wanderer\\" is the most unique cut simply due to Johnny Cash singing lead vocals. His deep voice gives the song a haunting and mesmerizing tone that adds one last unique aspect this exploratory journey. Let the album play on after the song ends and the surprise that greets you will instantly sound familiar to anyone who's worked in radio. It's one last affirmation that this is a band not content on doing the usual.<br /><br />20 years after its inception Zooropa is still unlike anything else in the band's discography. U2 has always been known for pushing themselves and exploring new avenues, yet this album is a different animal altogether. It wouldn't be surprising to mistake this for another band or to be initially confused about who you're listening to. This is the sound of a group at the height of their powers making the music they want to make with complete disregard for the critics and expectations heaped upon them. Before bands like Radiohead and R.E.M. began experimenting with computers, loops, and numerous effects U2 had already jumped in and mined the dark and obscure corners. They weren't the first band to do this but it's hard to think of a group that did it so suddenly and competently. Bono once described Achtung Baby as \\"The sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree.\\" With Zooropa they didn't just seek new ground but instead sought a new planet altogether. Two decades later it's still a place made for endless exploration.as a U2 effort but that's also one of its biggest strengths.

1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon for over 25 years, recounts his near-death-experience when in 2008, he contracted a rare bacterial meningitis which essentially shut down his brain.  Over a period of seven days, his body remained in a coma, while his consciousness experienced an other-worldly reality with utmost clarity.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander shares the details of his experience along with details of his personal life which add an interesting twist at the end.  What makes this account of a near-death-experience unique is that Dr. Alexander is able to go through many scientific reasons that could explain his experience and discount them.  In his opinion, his experience was nothing less than an encounter with the Divine.<br /><br />Proof of Heaven is a well-written, compelling book.  Those who believe in the afterlife will find it a reassuring validation of their beliefs.  Those who do not will find reason to doubt.  In any case, it is an excellent read and one that would appeal to those seeking answers to what lies ahead after this life.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I find this book educational, in several different subjects. Learning about the culture of India. Her religious experiences and her convictions on how to beat cancer. Then finally her NDE. How it was recognize on her return by medical field.<br />For me it was spiritually uplifting; and gave me a renewed spiritual outlook. . Very rewarding mentally, spiritually, and physically. I am recommending to all my family and friends as uplifting and well written.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am just finishing up season 1 and loving this show.  Great courtroom & law firm drama, with an intriguing ongoing story line about the Julianna Marguiles' character and her family dealing with her husband's (alleged?) crimes while he was the D.A. in Chicago. The plot always keeps me guessing and wanting to know what will happen next-- I am hooked!
B006OAB2XO|5.0|The music is ethereal and meditative with haunting vocals layered over trance inducing rhythms. One hears whispers of Cocteau Twins or early Dead Can Dance. Grimes has described this as &#34;headphone music&#34;, and yet I long to hear it played loudly in a symphony hall or mixed into a dj set in a dingy warehouse.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Nice graphics, no lag and a good way to burn time.  Turn sounds off unless you have headphones on or speakers off.  Sounds can b annoying and disruptive, especially if u want others to think you're working.

If you don't own it, you haven't heard Turandot yet! PERIOD

B00B6QXN56|5.0|My husband fell in love with this CD after watching the performance on PBS. I bought him another Joe Bonamassa<br />CD but he didn't care for that one. He absolutely loves the acoustic guitar though. I would definitely purchase this one<br />again.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|All mysteries have their plot holes. This series' plot holes are few. The idea that a young girl has been oppressed by a secret government agency may seem absurd at first. However, right now White Bulger is on trial. The FBI protected him from prosecution for robbery and murder because he was helping them take down the mafia. The author of the book about Bulger and the FBI talks about a woman whose daughter was courted by one of Bulger's allies, then probably killed by him. This same man then began courting the sister of the murder victim and the mother could not get the police to do anything about it, according to the author this was because the FBI was protecting Bulger.<br />  Like the heroes of the story, Lisbeth Salander, MikaelBlumkvist, and Erika Berger. Lisbeth Salander is an amazing character: suspicious, anti-social with little capacity for intimacy or overt positive expression. A short, slender, multiply abused woman who can think in a crisis and fight. A flawed heroine who has her own commitment to justice.<br />  The crisis at the end of book three is resolved by reference to thinks that happened in the first book. ingenuous.<br />  By the way. I have seen both the Swedish and American versions of the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. Much prefer the Swedish version as has the two to five other people I know who have seen both versions.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|Her other books are better, but an easy read when I had nothing else to do.I won't pick it up again and I've read most of her books twice.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Having seen The Beatles live in the 60's - yes, LIVE - and bought everything that they recorded as a group and individually, I was<br />amazed at this quasi-tribute film by an amazing cast and crew.  Julie Taymor may have been &#34;let go&#34; by Edge and Bono during<br />the Spiderman show, but here she brings some of the Beatles hits to life again with Bono, Joe Cocker and exceptionally talented<br />cast.  Even Eddie Izzard dazzles with a cameo for &#34;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite.  Superb!  Evan Rachel Wood and Jim<br />Sturgess do a great job on many of the numbers, and Dana Fuchs and Martin Luther in their roles as Janice and Jimi images<br />are excellent; but if you want to hear the ABSOLUTE BEST VERSION of &#34;Let it Be&#34; by Carol Woods and &#34;Come Together&#34; by Joe<br />Cocker, then you need to buy this Blu-ray movie.  Make sure that the audio of your home theatre system is set properly and you will treasure this alongside &#34;Concert for George&#34;.

0812550706|3.0|This review is more about the service than the book. After I get a chance to read it, I will make a review of the book. I have to ask Kindle about the sample....<br />Who was paying attention to this book when you cut the sample? 81% of the sample is the authors' intro, not the story!  I only had a chance to read a few paragraphs!<br />Can you pay better attention to the editing of the samples? I am a total bibliophile, and read A LOT. So, I am a little put off by how short the sample truly was. I would like to get into the book a little farther before deciding if I want to purchase it.<br />Thanks!

B008JFUPOY|5.0|Well, Pixar's done it again. Another home-run sequel in the tradition of Toy Story 2 and 3 (but not so much Cars 2), Monsters University is a wonderful film that expands upon and enhances the Monsters universe with enough narrative and heart to justify its own film.<br /><br />As expected, there are gags galore as we see protagonist Mike Wazowski, stepping into the spotlight from his more \\"buddy\\" role in the original Monsters, Inc., arrive at his first day of college, move into the dorms, and experience Greek Life. There are plenty of monsters and nostalgia-inducing college sights to see throughout Mike's journey.<br /><br />We see familiar faces, like Randall the villain monster from the original, who is now just a classmate and colleague of the main monsters. We even revisit the Monsters, Inc. workplace a couple times. But what's so fantastic about this sequel is that it doesn't handicap itself by relying so much on familiarity; the story and message driving this work is compelling enough to hold its own, which is hard enough for any companion film let alone a prequel.<br /><br />One of the movie's best moments comes when the brothers of Oozma Kappa, the ragtag fraternity of misfit monsters, peeks inside the Monsters, Inc. headquarters. They themselves an outcasted bunch of individuals, they admire how at Monsters, Inc., none of the scarers have anything in common - anybody could grow up to be a scarer, not just bigger, stronger, scarier monsters.<br /><br />While this movie has its share of sentimentality, it's not the emotional juggernaut of other Pixar efforts, and it doesn't need to be. This is a film about the future, and how anybody can achieve their dreams through hard work and determination. It's not a regretful, remorseful look at the past such as Brave and Toy Story 3; it's about how to move forward and build yourself into who you want to be.<br /><br />*SPOILER: I also love the very ending of this film, with Mike and Sulley being forced out of school and working their way up from the bottom at the Monsters, Inc. mailroom. This was a surprising and refreshing end, to show these two young men at a potential dead end, but who just keep plowing ahead to their goal of becoming top scarers, and doing what they need to to reach that level. This is the kind of story that is realistic yet inspirational, and considerably more powerful than if they had graduated as top students and immediately got top-level positions at Monsters, Inc. I am really proud of Pixar for going with this less glamorous yet more realistic and admirable plot point. *END SPOILER<br /><br />Monsters University is the rare sequel with characters we know so well, and who still manage to surprise us and even move us. In my opinion, it improves upon the original through its complexity, integrity, and heart.d working their way up from the bottom at the Monsters, Inc. mailroom.

The watch arrived in perfect condition, but after I put it on the fourth time, the exact same piece cracked, rendering it useless.  I now have to try to get my money back through the secondary vendor, which I doubt will be easy or even successful.  I've been wearing Swatch watches for years, but clearly they are making an inferior product these days.
B003UM8T3U|5.0|Breathless is a film that leaves you just that; it is a brisk 90something minute journey that rarely slows down, delivering an exhilarating experience through both its narrative and its filmic style.<br /><br />Godard's first film follows a man on the run, after committing a murder in rural France, who reunites with a former flame, an American reporter. The two are both the pursuers and the pursued, whose roles constantly shift both among themselves and with their surroundings. The power plays among the two of them are just as compelling as their experiences on the edge of the law.<br /><br />Through brilliant editing techniques, such as jump cuts and sound continuity, the action unfolds upon the audience with great efficiency and effectiveness. We see the full extent of their actions and their dialogue, quickened by the luxury of jump cuts, eliminating that which is not necessary and heightening the sense of urgency throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Even when the two are at rest, passing the time in a hotel after being pursued by the authorities, the pace does not slow down, as we witness very well-written conversations between the young lovers. They view life with a cynicism that is somehow fatalistic yet charming, with an authenticity rare to characters with such a negative perspective. It rings as true, not the cliche that it has become in a post-Breathless world.<br /><br />In addition to its own merits, which are plentiful, Breathless is such an essential viewing due to how influential it has become. Both its formal techniques, of story and script, as well as its informal aspects, such as editing and sound, have paved the way for many modern films. Even among our contemporary cinema, though, Breathless still delivers an exhilarating and truly breathtaking ride.
1451624468|1.0|This book is unreadable. The author is distinguished and well-meaning, but writes in awkward, lurching, convulsive sentences. In the future, he should get his books rewritten by more gifted writers.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little sharpener. Great for travel, and really puts a good edge on your knives. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes to keep a good edge on their knives, even when your on the go.
B007P7UF06|5.0|Everything was exactly as I remembered it, clear and perfect sound combined with picture perfect scenes made this a joy to watch and hear all the wonderful songs of this play.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved this book!  Last week I had never heard of it and then as I saw a post go around about favorite YA novels this one kept getting brought up.  I went to the library and grabbed a copy and I am so glad I did!  What a great book!  It is one of those I needed to sleep on it before reviewing it.  I loved that it was set in the 1980's first of all.  Eleanor had such a sad life you just wanted someone to help this poor girl and get her away from how she had to live.  I was left wanting more of the story but I understand why the author ended the book the way she did, and I appreciate it!  If you like YA novels about those awkward years and awkward young adults this is your book.  Nobody is perfect and Eleanor is far from perfect...but Eleanor and Park are perfect together.  This is their story told by them both.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can you escape is a really fun game I loved it!!! In my opinion this game gets u thinking and if u want to be an Fbi or some one who solves crimes this is a perfect game for you I love this game sadly i fished all of the levels so I guess I did escape!

B00CF34B2I|1.0|I tired to download the first time on my kindle fire and it said it didn't have enough storage, I made plenty of space by removing all of my apps, did it again. Magic is not on my device but it stole my space worth x2 the memory for it, I can't even remove it! BUG
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Bought this CD with no point of reference except for appearance on Darryl's House.  Boy, was I surprised!  This album is obviously a dedication to the Motown sounds and the city of Detroit although there are no covers.  Artist styles range from Curtis Mayfield to (you name it) soul music standouts.  If you are into the soul brother sounds, this is a must jam for you!  Give it a shot.....satisfaction guaranteed.
0374533555|4.0|A truly remarkable book with powerful insights into the frailty and vulnerability of the thinking mind.  Even the author admits (p417) that despite all his work and research that he has only improved to recognise situations in which errors are likely. I got it that we are not quite as reliable as we think we are.<br /><br />Not always an easy read, with much statistical explorations and studies that compete and dilute some of the outcomes (needing some relegation to appendices) but perseverance is rewarding and potentially life changing.<br /><br />This book could contribute to enhancing the culture of organisations from whom Kahneman has some insightful suggestions such as....\\"an organisation is a factory that manufactures judgments and decisions\\". For that he feels organisations should provide a distinctive vocabulary and a culture in which people watch out for one another as they approach minefields (meaning, weakness of our System 1 minds). (p418). Oh yes! For organisations he sees a weakness with meetings and his message is for training for conducting efficient meetings. (p419) Another for the organisation is .....\\"decision makers will make better choices when they trust their critics to be sophisticated and fair and when they expect their decisions to be judged by how it was made, not only by how they turned out.\\" (p418). Perfect!<br /><br />I hope to see a restructured re issue of this book to give more prominence and expansion to the many gems that sometimes are given only short shrift or buried with detail.<br /><br />Highly recommended including for those that invest and there alone I saw myself making costly mistakes due to the `disposition effect' (preference for selling winners rather than losers) which has profound implications also for CEOs of organisations.<br /><br />Among my top five great reads and only four stars because it needs a little restructuring and expansion in some parts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While I wasn't quite sure what to expect after the first segment, I quickly became hooked as the story progressed - so much so that I immediately had to go out and purchase the Shift Omnibus as well.<br />If you are a psychological sci-fi/post-apocalyptic/dystopian novel fan, check out WOOL...you won't be disappointed.  Good characterization, haunting setting, and chilling statement about those in charge and the lengths people will go to to ensure their own continued dominance.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game is confusing but it makes your mind work. they need to add more levels though..cause it is addicting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it, I could not wait for season 3 to be on prime.  I watch prime while I am walking on the tread mill
030758836X|2.0|Never read this author before and was looking forward to reading this book. I kept seeing it and it looked interesting. Once I started reading i became bored. The story line was great but it just wasn't holding my interest. I did finish it mainly because hey I bought it. It probably would have been better if girl would have stayed gone. Disappointed.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I think its a stupid. game ever in the world I hats it I hate it I hate it foreall
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I read this one many years ago but it has stayed with me. Sad, sad book but you should read this one. It's like life, so much joy than sorrow. But like the song The Dance 'I could have missed the pain'. But I'd of had to miss the dance'. Just make sure as you come to the end you have a box of tissue near.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I had watched all of these disks within a week now i am caught up to live TV<br />Looking forward to every Tuesday for the newest episode
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I did enjoy the quirky main characters in this YA fantasy novel. But the plot almost overwhelmed them with its wanderings. It does all come together in the end. The dialogue is clever and provides amusing contrast to the de rigueur slimy, bloody combat with gross creatures.  Here's hoping the upcoming film version will tighten up the story but still have fun with the characters.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like mahjong and to have it on the go is even better for boring waits. Its fun and entertaining.
B009ZQJVAK|3.0|Interesting movie that I am glad to have seen, but I did not care for the hard to understand english accents
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|its a good game to pass the time. load up is a little slow but everything else is fine. I enjoy it,
0062014536|3.0|I enjoyed the stories well enough obviously as I read the whole series. However, I really thought the ending could have been a bit more tied together. I suppose I just don't care for vague endings. I mean I understood it. I got it. I just felt like after all of that, there could have been more of an ending. Most series I have read had a great ending. (Hunger Games, Potter, etc etc) If I put forth the effort to read a whole series I expect more when it comes to the last morsel. It is like eating a five course meal. The first four courses are delicious, but then the dessert comes and it is just meh. Kind of puts damper on the over all meal.<br /><br />:/
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|its good to pass the time but saving is a little tough for me to negotiate. its entertaining while you play at least
030758836X|5.0|Read it to find out. I loved this read. I enjoyed the style the book was written in, and the characters themselves were written so real. A great suspenseful novel!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like that i can keep myself in the loop with friends and news on the books or shows I'm watching.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a good book. I enjoyed it. It was hard to put down. The characters were well written. They were vivid in description.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The book was very good and I liked how it went a lot  but it I liked matched better.  Crossed was more about the rising and not love. It depends if your more into love or action.

0345803507|5.0|GREAT SERIES OF BOOKS AND GLAD THAT I FOUND YOUR SITE TO BUY THEM.  PASSED THEM ON TO FRIENDS TO READ.
B00A861QMM|5.0|The dialogue is a little too much but I enjoyed playing it. I actually received this game for free through iTunes. I didn't even know it existed. I purchased part 2 because I liked this one a lot.
0385363125|5.0|BOUGHT THE WHOLE SET = IT WAS SPELLBOUNDING = AFTER PASSING THEM ON TO FRIENDS I PASSED THE COMPLETE SET ON TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR THE MOVIE.
B004478AS4|5.0|Achebe charts the fate of one whose life ceases to have meaning when tradition is destroyed. The novel creates a world that it in turn sees destroyed, and in so doing reverses the perspective we have on :&#34;civilizing:&#34; native peoples. Unsparing and honest, the work estranges the tongue of the colonial master to communicate the effects of mastery.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|The book follows the story of a few lives of people who were born and started life in North Korea and eventually, after years of social and economic deterioration struggle to survive, made the sacrifices and decisions to live in a free world. The progression of the state of the country, the people, and the economy is well represented.  The personal accounts of the politics, the culture, and ultimately, the large amount of people starving to death and lack of food in general in the country is shocking and gut wrenching. Countries have sent so much aid to no avail and yet it is a country that continues to close off to the rest of the world.<br /><br />It took a couple chapters to warm up but soon I was intrigued and wanted to keep reading. The subject is very relevant today in 2013 and the insights, perspectives, and feelings offer a wide perspective. I would highly recommended read for anyone into current events and searching for a better understanding of the political, economical, and cultural exploration and discovery. I found the stories a bit thrilling at times and sobering and solemn in following along with the stories and lives of real people, some of whom eventually who got out. The perspective is someone outside of the inner and closely knit circles of conversation and only touches on Korean culture and behaviorism but still an admirable reporting and account of stories put together to form a picture of North Korean lives and living from an objective perspective.
B001HBYH9Q|2.0|Unnecessary sexual dialog. Plot had potential, but the characters were too immoral.  The message seems to be that premarital sex leads to a happy marriage with someone famous.  I liked the concept of the famous person falling in love with the &#34;guy next door&#34; but it was poorly executed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this is one of the best ongoing series I have ever seen in a long while. I highly recommend it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Completely enjoyed it. I don't like gore but Quentin Tarantino gets away with it in my book because his movies have a way of drawing you in!
B008XG1X18|4.0|It has become my summer addiction.  Really like the setup. Looking So easy to use. Looking forward to using many of the ideas.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|This was an awesome thriller and kept me on edge the whole time with a twist at the end that I was not expecting.<br />If you like suspense this is the movie for you.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My daughter enjoys the free version. A bit repetitive and she'll probably be bored in no time. But for now, she's interested and enjoying it. I can't get the full version loaded on her kindle.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have two different Android phones and two different dragon story's I love it that much,I would surly recommend it to anyone
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Another great Rebus book. I'm glad Rebus is not yet gone. Looking forward to the next installment. Hopefully Rebus will be back on the force.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game  fascinating and addicting.  It is not so easy as to be boring and not so hard as to be frustrating. I look forward to future updates<br /><br />.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Pretty fun, a bit addictive. Strategic gameplay is nice. Definitely worth getting. Once you get into levels up in the 20s it's pretty hard and you gotta wait a bit longer for things to happen in the game .
B003L77GGK|5.0|BOUGHT AS A GIFT FOR DAUGHTER WHO LOVES  &#34;her boys&#34;  These are high quality DVDs  for anyone who is a big fan of the series
B00CH87HF4|3.0|I ain't had no probs. I play it kinda rarely tho.hope to see how accommodating it will be for users
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really challenging and fun! Bring on the new rooms! Definitely a game for people who enjoy solving puzzles! Great job!
B009FZHYKU|1.0|More Zombies...  World War Barf.  Just watch Night of the Living Dead and grow up.  I know it makes money, but are there no new ideas in Hollywood?  The answer is no.  Just corporate, studio, social media tested crap.  Why can't Doris Day be a real life Zombie guest star?
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Quality stuff my wife love it, me even more because i can use it for other electronic devicrs that are compatibile with it
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I am very happy with the item.  I wanted something for my Husband and I to both charge our phones with on long trips, this works perfectly for that.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game really can get you involved in playing it.  Enjoyable, but takes a lot of planning to build items in the best order.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is really good and I cannot stop playing it. I love the best game ever and that game is dragonvale
B003D513TQ|4.0|Perhaps a tad romanticized, but pretty to look at.  The BBC production of Edward VII gives a different picture of Queen Victoria...more of a selfish, spoiled and not as bright as Albert.  Albert comes off a little better, but not much.  He appears to be a typical German obssessed with schedules, details and propriety.  Interesting historical figures, though perhaps not as beautiful and romantic as pictured in this film.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|i just sent one on the Accelerating Charger and it goes for the same with this<br />Can someone from customer service please call me since i was to get a call weeks ago and never did and cant get thru to someone
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I had moderate expectations seeing that Ironman movies are pretty good, but some of the others were just ok.  This movie really exceeded my expectations.  Great story and character development to start off the series.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|People buy this game it's awesome cause you get to cook many different foods and have neighbors and look at other people's restaurants and food. The food has time limits and it expires if you don't get it in time after the food is ready. Also, you have challenges that you can earn money and gems from. Some have time limits and some you do whenever you want to. Add me Pomeranian2468 if you get this wonderful game. Here are some of my favorite dishes.<br /><br />1. Cosmic Soda<br />2. Apple Pie<br />3. Chocolate Fountain<br />4. Mozzarella Sticks<br />5. Macaroni And Cheese  WARNING: The game will make you hungry
B00D6M86RS|4.0|Nice Game To Play, Amazon just need to remove the Kindle Fire as a compatible device on the purchase screen.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The person who invented angry birds is a genius. This game is sooooooo addicting. It's really fun and hard well some levels are hard. One time I spent a month on a level in the beach volley section. It's weird how slingshooting birds at pigs became such a hit. If you like angry birds and the movie Rio you'll LOVE this awesome game. I hoped my review helped you:-)
B004K58GSO|5.0|Typical western movie of the time which means all family members can watch this movie. Walter Brennan was special to watch. He was a great character actor.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|Imagine going from a video game challenge to being chosen to  conquer the bad guys in space!  There are wonderful moments of familial love, young love, space creatures and, for the time is was put out, computer graphics.  The young &#34;hero&#34; has decisions to make about the paths the story offers him to take.  Good Fun.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This movie is fantastic. Even if it doesn't have the song Equestria Girls that I same listed on the movie's WIKIPEDIA page. For me Helping Twilight Get Her Crown was my favorite song in the movie. I don't think Sunset Shimmer's demon form is any worst that either Nightmare Moon in the MLP TV series or even the evil Fairy in Disney Sleeping Beauty turning into a dragon. How they deal with Sunset Shimmer remind me very much with how Nightmare Moon was dealt with.<br /><br />Hasbro did a good job picking the person who wrote some of the best and most popular episodes of the show to do the script of the movie. Its great watching Princess Twilight adjust to being human and the human world in the movie. Meeting Fluttershy for the first time is a revamp of their first meeting in Friendship is Magic season one. The movie has good anti bulling and believing in yourself theme to it without taking away the entertainment that made the series itself so great. I was surprise at Trixie's scene at the vending machine as before seeing the movie I was under the impression she was just in the back ground crowd to look for like many of the other characters.  The bits in the crystal empire with Flash Sentry was so good I'm sad he won't be part of series season 4. Since human Big Mac is skin tone like Doug was in Doug series shame they couldn't of stuck 1980s MLP  Megan into the human section of this world for those who grew up on original series.<br /><br />There are some talk from Hasbro about an Equestria Girls spin off which I wouldn't mind as long as we keep Ponyville's Princess Twilight and not replace her with the always been human Twilight of that other world.
B0016BWACI|5.0|The Jim Henson/Frank OZ puppetry is absolutely fascinating.  The story is many layered and even scary as it unfolds.  The &#34;evil&#34; puppets are that, the &#34;good&#34; guys are that and they must meet in the end.  Recommend preteen and up.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is the best is the series! It took me away from my everyday life wish there would be another
B0066O0NP6|5.0|Fabulous series. I am so glad Amazon Prime has &#34;The Good Wife&#34;<br />I highly recommend this show and am looking forward to catching up on all seasons.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Loved this book both for the story and all I learned from it. If you have any interest is in people and what we're all capable of you enjoy this book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|awesome game good story good graphics only thing I would change is to have it last a little longer. would love to play more games like this.
B007RP4D5Y|2.0|This CD was too jazz for me.  I love Pat Methenys' Secret Story CD and many of his other ones but this one was not what I like.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about this case. It fits well and is so simple, it's perfect. Great price for a great product.
0062215507|5.0|Big name book stores charge twice as much for this.  Buy it here and save yourself some money, it's so worth it!
B000T00PE2|4.0|The female vocals and groove of this Compact disk are amazing. The songs with the guy can go to trash
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|It sounds just thrown together from some of his other hits. Definitely not the more mainstream stuff he produced in the past. Not sure what he was aiming for. He gonna have to make something new to take this album from memories because my guess is his fan base is strinking fast.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't use this app every day but it comes in handy when I do. I also have the moleskin pocket note book and I love that I can take a picture of one of the pages and it pops up on my PC and phone and tablet that I have evernote in. I take notes on everything and separating all that is made simple not one to write down but also to retrieve.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|Great Value..!! and works perfectly with no problems on my QNAP ts-469L, easy installation and cheaper alternative to other Memory modules.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|What a great group...It's Lady Antebellum...it's fantastic.  Wonderful songs, lyrics.  Love the bands cohesiveness n chemistry.  They keep putting out great music.  Keep on cranking them out.
B006LG74R4|5.0|The movie was Good funny and Dumb now i have the two titles.It came on time its a very reliable way to buy.I will keep.on buying with you guys.
B000068TPN|5.0|I am a veteran of that war and the night I first watched it, I was living in a trailer in the country. When the main fire fight began I will admit it scared me because the sounds were so realistic. Also I just happened to have been a crew member on a huey, UH-1 D. It's a movie that I believe all should see.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love this cd my favorite song from the host is on it and other great songs. Really worth buying great music.
076780421X|5.0|Too cute! Loved the acting and the storyline. Just so sweet and funny. The kind of movie that puts a smile on my face from start to finish. I've watched it several times and enjoyed it over and over again.
055358894X|5.0|Wow! What a ride this wonderful story is.<br /><br />First, to make things clear, you will see a lot of comparisons to this ala Robin Hood, Ocean's 11, etc. While it definitely shares some similarities, it is important to make clear that this is a unique story and you will not finish the book thinking it is something you've already experienced. The world is unique and brilliantly described, the characters are interesting, and the technical aspect of the writing is very sound. The book's strongest suit however is the wonderful dialogue. The characters have sharp tongues that are clever and witty and conversations are fluid and interesting. Some authors seem hesitant to include cursing, or try to invent new terms which rarely have the same impact. There is no shortage of swearing here, but it is not just thrown in without purpose. It fits perfectly with the characters and adds humor while most importantly maintaining believability. We're dealing with the underground world of thieves, so it is relieving to see the honest dialogue you would expect. I do not think it would be a stretch to say that this was the most entertaining read I can remember, and certainly the most I've ever laughed while reading a book.<br /><br />The structure of the plot is fairly standard for a fantasy novel, the first half is mostly introduction and then the action begins to pick up steadily as it progresses towards the conclusion. It is unique in that is not quite the common telling of age story and instead shows the characters as they're growing up mixed in with current plotline in the present. While I think this will strike some as odd at first, it does the job well and reminds me a bit of the Name of the Wind and the use of the frame. Both authors (Scott Lynch and Patrick Rothfuss respectively) used a unique mechanic in their debut and I find it absolutely adds to the experience. The plot itself is exciting and will have you turning the page for more. I found some character identities a bit predictable before their reveal, but most of the time I had no idea what was coming next or how a situation would get resolved. My only complaint would be that at times the MC's tolerance for a beating seemed perhaps a bit unrealistic, but this is a small issue.<br /><br />The plans of the MC will confuse you at first, but leave you smiling and remarking on their brilliance at the end. In one breath you'll call a character a crazy bastard, and in the next you will be laughing at his genius. The wonderful comradery will leave you wishing you were part of devious group yourself. Truly, these emotions are the draw of any thief/heist story and the Lies of Locke Lamora does not fail to deliver.
B00005JKG9|5.0|One of the BEST movies of all time. The acting is state of the art. The plot is well developed. The dialogue is perfection. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of this masterpiece.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|i've never seen the original maverick with james garner, but i thought it was a good idea to have in him this movie as mel's father ... i thought it was a good movie and funny too.  :)

B00AAX68HG|5.0|Love this free app. I was addicted quickly & so is my 5 y/o. I'm glad it is a multi-generation,fun family game. We are up grading to the ad-free version as soon as we can.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The graphics are awesome. The game play is very cool!! I have the Kindle HD 8.9 @ it rocks on here. I recommend everyone has this game in their collections.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I don't know how I missed this one as a child, because I read tons of classic literature when I was younger. But I gave it a go now that I'm old(er), and was not disappointed. Very exciting read!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I rarely write reviews or complain about products, but this is a rare and weird circumstance. The performances contained in this album are all first rate, but the production is weirdly awful. Overly boosted bass, lack of higher frequencies and the mid-range (where most vocals and instruments ranges occur) is, at times, in your face loud, and then muffled in the background. I love hearing Mr. Bubl&eacute;'s voice soaring over a roaring big band, but it just doesn't happen here. The whole album just is just so poorly produced that the amazing performers are completely lost in the mix. I can only surmise that some kind of limiter was used so that levels didn't get out of hand, but it was used way too aggressively in this case. Maybe the reference speakers in the studio were shot, maybe the headphones were broken, maybe the whole thing was produced so it would sound right on an iphone's speakers.<br />All the ingredients are there for an amazing album, they just weren't 'cooked' properly.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This was my first experience with Sherlock Holmes books, and I loved it!! It was very exciting, intriguing, and entertaining.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel kept me drawn in with all the twists and turns, but was VERY disappointed in the ending.  Not what I expected.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is super fun and works well. My boys and i get a kick out of it and love to play it. We have a lot of laughs together playing. Its definitely one of the best simple and original games out here. Get it, you will like it.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I have been playing with this program for several days, and never knew that wasting time could be so much fun.You can change your palette, and the effect of touch and speed. Makes anybody feel like they can sell paintings at the flea market. If there was only a way to get these drawings on velvet!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what a fun game my son and I both love it! cant wait for more levels. it really makes you think!
0062238868|5.0|a must read wont be able to put it down. great book. every one needs to read this.very good book
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Ok, so this game is alright... IF IT WOULD LET US PLAY MORE THAN 15 MIN. When they mean demo they mean DEMO!!! Even if this wasn't a demo it would be better but not at all like minecraft pe (a real mineccraft) For goodness sake in this one u get killed by wolf's and you have to find everything to even start to make a house. Don't waste your time with this demo buy the REAL virson beloved me its worth 7 bucks!
B003ES61EE|2.0|Falls apart constantly. Very disappointed. Buying a new one (different brand) immediately. If it stayed together I would give this a 4 because it cleans but doesn't leave a streak free finish.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Unlike other games this one gave me a little more challenge. I suggest if anybody is looking for a game to pass the time, this game is definitely a winner. Hopefully someone create more levels.
B002PJN59M|5.0|This has always been one of my all time favorite movies for any fantasy lovers out there! I think this is just the best King Arthur movie out there.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Excellent show. Causes one to think things through in a way that requires flexibility. The best idea is to watch the show from the first episode to the last in order. There are clues and important information given in each episode that leads to the conclusion in the last episode. This is a good show for adults only (not for children), adults who are interested in murder mysteries with a twist.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Since  I have a son in the military  I wanted to see what the book was about. I am grateful for people like Chris Kyle who are so willing to put themselves on the line and just see it as part of their job. There were parts of the book where I did not like Chris.  Overall I thought it was interesting reading from his point of view.
B000JCSBU0|4.0|It's a good film. The only thing that bothered me was the soundtrack. I'm sure if I had watched this film when it came out, I would have put this soundtrack on my favorites playlist...BUT goodness, it's the soundtrack of YouTube. Too many YouTubers use the soundtrack of this film to home made videos...<br /><br />Anyway, overall, this film is great. I wouldn't watch it with my parents or younger kids, but yeah, it's a gritty story about addiction. It's about addiction to drugs, an addiction to a dream of having happiness and a better life and how far one will go to satisfy those dreams. You take an addiction too far, and you might end up like the four characters in this film. These four characters are just hopeless dreamers imprisoned by drugs and the dependency of it. I'd say yes this film is disturbing...but it doesn't necessarily leave a major impression on me. Maybe I've just been desensitized to seeing disturbing films and content...After seeing films like \\"Kids\\" and \\"Gummo\\"...this is just like one of those artistic films that tries to depict reality as shocking and disturbing as the directors can try to get. It makes you feel depressed...but it's the world we live in, it's reality. Each of these characters in the film I can easily see in every junkie or homeless person on the street. This is just the story of how these people got to where they are, losing everything for just a small ounce of happiness.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Was excited about upgrade but it completely messed up the functionality of the movement of the pieces.  CCOMPLETELY FRUSTRATED.  Love this app.....hope the bugs are fixed soon.
B005UG542S|5.0|My family have all the Harry Potter movies since receiving the last 2. In my opinion, this is the best in the series.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful story of family. Hosseini writes with such passion for his characters. One feels the pain, the joy and the struggle of each person's journey.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Great CD, very relaxing and even though I don't understand the language, you can feel emotions in this CD.  Andrea has such a great voice, not surprising that he continues to be so popular.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love finding recipes, crafts, ideas all in the same place n being able to come back for information on how to make things.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I simply love the way Hosseini writes and enjoyed this book.  If you are a fan, read it.  It does hop all over the place, and if I put it down for several days, I had to refresh my memory to get back into it.
B00A3YTC6Q|5.0|So I must admit that this entire movie franchise is a guilty pleasure for me. It is usually obvious within 15 minutes of these shows that you have reached the pinnacle (and how low it is!) of every theatrical aspect EXCEPT dancing. These kids my not be the best actors on the planet but brother they can move! Of the four I have seen, this by far had the consistently best presentation. The second had a great close (that water scene was bad @$$!) but this show had it plugged in and turned up for every dance scene. The styling for the scene in the restaurant where they dance to Skylar Grey was crazy good and EVERYTHING about the art show scene was superb! That jellyfish ballerina bit was mesmerizing, truly. The final dance scene was some of the most 'fun' I've seen through the whole series. Where can I get one of those sparking sticks?
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I am never going to delete this game it is AWESOME!!!!! The sounds are realistic. If you love army you will love this game.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this it is.one of my favorite games it's also the first game I got on my device!<br />I just love it it is the only thing I play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the BEST game in the galaxy. You must get it. I LOVE it .Don't trust the 1-2-3 star rates.
0425252868|5.0|I finished \\"A Higher Call\\" last night, and want to say thank you to both Adam Makos and Larry Alexander for an absolutely fantastic book. I started it in the evening and could not put it down, finishing at around 3 am.<br />I've read many books about WWII aviation. Not many of them struck me like this one has, with it's honest depiction of Franz Stigler's life, both in the Luftwaffe and post-war. I thought it had the right proportion between the coverage of the Luftwaffe pilot and that of Charlie Brown.  And Franz Stigler actually met Marseille in Africa, wow!<br />The photos were a very nice bonus, with many, especially of the Luftwaffe pilots, that I've not seen anywhere else.<br />A riveting read, and highly recommended.
0385333846|5.0|Kurt wrote this to tell us all how easy it is to send our children to battle and how little thought can go into the process of destruction. Like the cover says, you will not laugh or cry. It is perfect in that it hits the senses flat so the enjoyment is not the reason to read it...the message is the reason. Life is wasted on whims and false premises and there are serious consequences from these whims. Kurt, your one of my hero's. Thanks for the fantastic journeys you have sent so many on and the lessons in your books. You are missed
0307476073|4.0|I enjoyed the book, and appreciated the fact that Strayed interspersed her hiking experiences with narrative about her life before her adventure.  She seemed a bit self-obsessed, but I suspect that it was due to the fact that she was quite young at the time she undertook the PCT.  Hopefully she is a more well-rounded adult now.  Overall, a very good read.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The reason I give this game a 3 is because although it is fun and addictive it is constantly freezing up and not giving me my credits back I lost. The makers of the game need to fix the bugs.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|A great band playing great songs. I think this is one of those albums that every jazz aficionado would tell you to add to your collection if you don't already have it. Paul Desmond is a true original and just kills it throughout this whole album.
0060254920|5.0|My Son's favorite book, so I made sure I got one for my granddaughter's collection. PS I got her a &#34;wild thing, just like her DAD&#34; too
0756405890|5.0|Beginning was tough, but as I ploughed on it suddenly said \\"page 436\\"and kids were screaming for supper. Where did the time go?? I absolutely adore the characters, they are interesting enough to each have a book of their own to tell their stories. As the trouper he is, Kvothe deserves his limelight though. A wonderful read, truly. Enough to drown a mind in for a span or three, travel somewhere entirely new but yet familiar. Loving it.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|My son and hubby love it! It's fun and in a interesting way teaching the economic rules of Supply and Demand!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game, easy to learn, fast to play.  Helps keep those little grey cells active!  Love the tiles and different layouts.  You can play for a few minutes or longer.
B0060D2QR6|4.0|My 11 year old granddaughter loves this movie so we bought it to watch together.  I fell asleep (not steller acting) but she was excited to see it for the 5th or 6th time.  Has some good messages and I didn't notice anything risque or objectionable - when I was awake anyway!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book enjoyed every page, when is book 2 coming out cant wait, what more can I say, Luv'd it
B000SEGHT6|5.0|What surprised me most about this work was how humorous it can be.  A tale on the absurdity of warfare retold from the perspective of a hysterical imagination, the novel uses Billy Pilgrim's removal from reality to show how the human brain attempts to reason with chaotic events that 'Earthlings' inflict upon themselves.  The result is a view of warfare through a bizarre lens which, as it reveals the life of the protagonist, also reveals that the reader's own perspectives on massive casualties are just as far removed from actual happenings as Billy Pilgrim believes himself to be.<br /><br />If you are new to Vonnegut, this is a good place to start.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|This joystick had everything need to be a good stick but after less then 2 months the flaws in the design came out.<br /><br />The nice feature is that it is totally adjustable to you it is not a one size fits all which I really liked and for the first month or so it worked out great it takes a while to get it adjusted to be just right but once you get there it is locked in.<br /><br />After about a month of playing I started to notice that the stick felt like it was sticking it did not have the feeling that it was easy to move then in mid flight it got loose like it was new again.  The next thing I started to notice is the #2 button felt very loose but what really happened is that the ring under the tophat came off and it made the 2,3,4,& 5 button loose like there are ready to fall off which they can not do.  There is no way to fix this problem.<br /><br />As it is right now I would not recommend this to anyone
B000001A3H|5.0|The best Kyuss CD and a great road trip CD.  They rock out all the way.  This is a must have if you are a Kyuss or QOTSA fan.
B0086213XW|2.0|Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen are good.  Very good.  The scenes of their loving, sweet, uneven, and sometimes resentful marriage exposes universalities about the struggles of living with someone you have to love.  Both are sympathetic and funny and drive the best parts of the movie.  Less interesting is the gimmicky, too-perfect would-be paramour to Michelle Williams' character.  While the other characters are real, textured, and in a fight with the basic barriers and obstacles of life; he is completely unbound by basic requirements of life like money, places to live, fulfilling careers, and the like.  And it is in that courtship that the movie grinds to a screeching halt.  Though it's 2 stars, I would recommend it for people who like a different sort of movie that refuses to shy away from the basic and minor dust-ups that can throw our lives off kilter.  But I can't say it is consistently engaging or riveting.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Just have no symptoms and keep increasing resistance and when it's spread enough, drop super deadly but noticeable symtoms and you&acute;ll probably win
B008602KQI|3.0|Paced like an old Yugo, and directed with the restraint of a Liberace show, the movie corrupts what may be very good source material in many ways, focusing too much on the melodramatic internal struggles of the children and not nearly long enough on the real war of survivorship that is the movie's core.<br />Luckily for the movie, it has Jennifer Lawrence; an unstoppable force of nature we have not seen since Tom Cruise.  Infusing life, humor, and earnest vulnerability in every scene.  Her explosive performance holds together a movie that doesn't deserve it; and makes it a must see for anyone who realizes Lawrence now sits just behind Pitt, Cruise, and Clooney as our fourth most watchable actor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is AWESOME I love it I find my self playing this more then temple run thanks for creating this game I and my siblings LOVE it.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Django Unchained is Tarantino's take on the old Django films,the spaghetti westerns, Mandingo,revenge fantasy but with words and loquacity filling the spaces.We get a lot of the songs and musical interludes common to such films. The open landscapes are thrilling as is the background of slavery 2 years before the Civil War in 1858.The film is shot in the Western genre.There is a liberal use of the n------- word.The violence is of a cartoon variety,blood spurting out of bodies filled with lead.There are endless scenes of dialogue between King Schulz (Christof Waltz) and Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx).Waltz is good at the ornate verbal flourishes of Tarantino's dialogue.Foxx plays his character of the freed slave with a laconic intensity.He seems to have little personality and is largely in debt to King Schulz,who is the mentor,bounty-hunter and leader who plucks him from slavery to help him kill the Brittle Brothers.He uses Django as a bounty-hunter pursuing a gang of criminals.He is then led on a journey to save his wife,Broomhilda,a German-speaking slave from a plantation owner,Clavin J Candie(Ci Caprio) an enthusiast of to-the-death Mandingo fighting.Di Caprio is suitably malevolent as the owner of Candyland and gives impetus to the second part of the film.Samuel L Jackson is great as the head butler Stephen,the film's real antagonist,the real leader of the plantation house,sly,subtle,vindictive,nasty.An archetypal Uncle Tom of grovelling slave-subject mentality,speaking for his master.It's he that cottons on to the disguise of the Mandigo expert's cover of the strangers.Candie's Mississippi estate is like Versailles,with slaves seemingly on swings or wandering around or at the master's table,dining.The plantation has few workers in the fields and their dress seems too unruffled.<br /><br />You could say that Tarantino's take on slavery is offensive,with the slaves depicted as passive zombies or victims of abuse(in one case an aging slave no longer useful for Mandingofighting is torn apart by dogs) or whipping.They don't express themselves or even communicate with each other.But Tarantino comes at the subject like he did the Nazis in Inglourious Basterds.We can take pot shots at these oppressive slave-owners and traders.It's a given.It's a movie and its entertainment first and foremost:its approach to slavery is not Lincoln's or Amistad's depending on historical accuracy.No,hell we'll just do it,although Django is shown to go through hell to rescue Broomhilda. Tarantino makes an appearance too.The film could have done with about 25 minutes editing and the director's acting is not good.A scene of KKK Klansmen is totally gratuitious. Broomhilda is a passive character and the union with Django seems an anti-climax as their dialogue is drowned out with music.I still think Tarantino's best was Jackie Brown followed by Pulp Fiction.This is slavery as fodder for a pulp B Western movie, too sloppy, unfocused, and thematically unresolved. The film does have a beautiful,retro painterly look.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this app is great and not only can you set alarms but you can change the style of the clock it is AWESOME totally five star worthy you should get it!!<br />&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
B0018STVHQ|2.0|Maybe I missed the point but kinda lame. Not great story telling although Eric Bana was a good Henry XIII
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Is a life-changing book that you just can't stop reading. The more you read, the more you get involved with all the character's passage.
0679805273|5.0|This is one of my favorite books to give graduates. This time it was for my daughter. I absolutely love it!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I never read the books so I do not know how it compares but I really enjoyed learning the origins of the Wizard!
1878424505|5.0|This book is very inspiring and gives lots of information to improve and help one have a wonderful fulfilling life!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|For me, a Hollywood blockbuster often sets up for disappointment. I was rather surprised that when this movie ended I was left wanting for more.
1593157134|5.0|I could not put this book down from the moment i picked it up.  I would consider it a must read for all people!
B008LD09LS|5.0|No tonly is this a fun &#34;toy&#34;, but the Camera is great for doing Amateur Films. You can et nice, steday pan shots with it.Great for an amateur film maker!
B000063V8T|5.0|Of course TNG gets five stars. Now I can live in my Star Trek universe any time I want. I highly recommend getting all episodes on video. What kind of Trekkie would I be otherwise?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I didn't just read this book, I lived it.  Beautifully written.  Treat yourself to an exception experience.  It is so real that you feel that the characters existed and the events actually occurred
B000063V8U|5.0|Of course TNG gets five stars. Now I can live in my Star Trek universe any time I want. What kind of Trekkie would I be otherwise?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again I am struck by this authors ability to create such a beautiful story, bringing each character to life in a way that you feel you know each one, you have thought their thoughts and felt their feelings, it is a gift he has. I am so glad I read this book because I feel, as I did in the previous two books, that I have not only read a great story but I have learned something more about this world. i have enjoyed reading about people who are from Afghanistan and realizing their lives, wants, needs, humanity, is 'described' so beautifully, (and that they are just like me) rather than just looking at pictures of a people we have been at war 'with and against' for decades. I really enjoy this authors style of writing, it is such a pleasure to read his books.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|i like this game very much, as it keeps my brain going and the different scenes are great.at times it gets me frustrated but this is all for the good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am having fun playing this game. Its nice since I can not own my own horse. The graphics are really good too!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was a very cool game I played with my daughter we had lots of fun together.  works on your mire you should really try it!
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Love it, takes a while to grow on you like all his stuff, but well worth the wait.  Another masterpiece.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book to read. The end was a surprise but it was the best way to end the evil. I would recommend this story to read but be sure you read the first two before reading this.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|probably the best true gangster movie that I have seen.  Evil here is not a distant concept in an imagined totalitarian society (viz. Hitler, Stalin, Mao, etc.), but here it is, alive and well in post War sleepy LA;<br />The smartest and most ruthless gangster in the country absolutely dominates.  What to do?  Hold onto your seats, watch, and marvel.<br />Brilliant performances by all the cast - Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin, and all.<br />Screenplay and direction 100%
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Is etertaining, good character<br />I will like to read the other lee child books, easy to read<br />Good action<br />End
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Fantastic debut album that builds on their earlier EP.  If you've heard & enjoyed Safe and Sound or any other Capital Cities tracks, you won't be disappointed.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is awesome my son is a dinosaur fan and he enjoy it. I think is excellent. I recommend it to all the dinosaurs fans.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|As a Jack Reacher fan from the first book, I was thrilled to find out that there was going to be a film. That expectation was the high point of my experience with this movie.<br />First of all, the choice for a lead was so wrong! Tom Cruise has provided some excellent performances in his career, but this is not one of them. Most of the fun of the Lee Child series is the contrast between Jack's efforts to remain under the radar, and the circumstances he finds himself in that provoke him into revealing his capabilities.  I immediately  thought that Cruise had been miscast, and I was not wrong.Another distraction was the \\"restrained\\" sexual tension implied by the scene with his shirt off, and the unreal, unprofessional dress and behavior of the female lead. She served the same purpose as a shop mannequin, and her conduct should have gotten her fired the first time she came into the picture.<br />The pervading sense of disappointment was so overwhelming, I really could not concentrate on the movie as a separate entity  from the book series. Did I have expectations of the movie that were too high? Apparently. Was I correct? Obviously. Was what had been a promising beginning to a series of movies blown? Without a doubt.  I just thought that Lee Child must be off in the wings crying at the unforgivable mess that they made of his creation. Too bad!
B00B4FU6KE|2.0|I think this book is beautifully written. Unfortunately, about 40% of the way into it grimness overtakes the story, with graphic descriptions of laboratory animal mistreatment. I just had to put it down and go on to a different book, as I found it was making me literally ill.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Good and thought provoking for kids and adults. fun as one or as a group it would be a great real life game
