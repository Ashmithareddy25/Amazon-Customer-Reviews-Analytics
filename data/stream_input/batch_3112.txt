B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Artpop, above all else, is a continuation in Lady Gaga's exploration of her usual themes: artifice as personal expression, modern sexuality, and the effects of worldwide fame. I think it's great.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is as intelligent as she is totally bonkers. Artpop is expansive and sprawling, and seems like a bit of a mess at first glance, but its barrage of hooks and melodies works in its favor. Much like Born This Way, it's got so much ear candy that, even if you get lost in all its twists and turns, it's a fun place to explore.<br /><br />Gaga said at one point that she'd like to perform this album in its entirety, so she wisely constructs it in a way that would work for a live show, starting strong, pacing the album well, and closing with the two best songs: Gypsy, a gorgeous melody with some of her best lyrics, a pure pop number that has much in common with the classic song of the same title by Fleetwood Mac; and Applause, which would be a powerful encore in any show.<br /><br />She's a big personality, and much of her strength comes from that (note the various self-referential lines that call back to her earlier songs). The guest stars never overwhelm her, though they are given room to shine. This is definitely Gaga's show, and she makes the most of it. From the pulsing electronic music to the pure pop to the ballad, Dope, the artist is in fine form.<br /><br />There are high expectations of Lady Gaga, and people will no doubt criticize this album for not taking things to even greater extremes or varying enough from her previous themes, but Lady Gaga has created an outstanding pop album that moves her sound forward, if incrementally, and has plenty of interesting bits to keep us tuned in for quite some time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush..it is so addictive great game..every one in the family plays.<br /><br />The world best game in 2013
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Let me tell everyone now, this is a must read! This book starts out slow, and as you delve deeper into the book you will find that it has not only a great storyline, but also things that might just save your life if you get trapped. On a boat. With a tiger...<br /><br />I,for one, am a HUGE reader. Honestly, even though I read excessively, I rarely find books that where when I finish, I wish to start over and read again. Anyway, this story is about a young boy who's name is Pi. When his family moves from their current home via ship, it has assorted animals from their old business, a zoo.The ship ends up sinking, and when Pi gets in a lifeboat he doesn't realize that there is a tiger there also. This book explains the love/ relationship between the two as they journey through the ocean, all alone.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all YA, adults, or middle school level. Kudos to Yann Mattel, your book just got a 5.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Sad and also joyous at the same time. The absolute waste and loss of prisons, yet the amazing resiliency of the human spirit. The more we seem different the more we are the same.
B00F4386PY|5.0|Love this album, great tunes, powerful lyrics, excellent fret work, go Pearl Jam! If you have the opportunity to see the band in concert, go for it! Three of the best hours you will spend all year.
1250038820|5.0|I already loved Stanton on FB and pre-ordered two books -- one for my parents and one for me.  They also really like it.  I have it out in my living room to glance at whenever I want to read a vignette or two.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Good ending. I don't think it could've ended better. I'm sad it ended because I will miss the characters. Read it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|recommend if you're bored and enjoy puzzles not very hard just takes time to figure it out. hopefully there are more levels coming game only contains ten levels.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app it the best app for the kindle fire but it stuck when they don't have it for the iPad
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|They keep getting better and better. The solo tracks by Jonathan are unbelievable, as is their \\"Endless Love.\\" IMO, Jonathan's voice is more like Caruso than Pavarotti, but still HIS voice.<br />Anyone into crossover classical or those that like Operatic arias will love this c/d.<br />I rate it 5 stars and highly recommend it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app it the best and my favorite app on the iPad and y can do ANYTHING WITH THIS APP😀😀😀😀😀😀😀

B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this classic story. It is a favorite of mine. I wanted to read it again  to some children that hadn't ever read it or even seen the movie. They enjoyed it very much
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It takes so long to get anywhere I became bored and deleted the game. It Was really fun until I got to the higher levels though.  I did not like the constant push to buy more lives.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, because although I had heard of the movie, Safe Haven, I hadn't seen it yet. It was fun, easy reading, with likable characters.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After putting all the pieces together, I found I couldn't put it down. All the people in what I thought was just a silo, turned out to be a whole community. It blew me away. Can't wait to find out what Juliet will do, and what of Solo. How is he fairing with his new responsibilities. The other kids. I don't want to spoil it for anyone. It's definitely the book I was looking for.
0887431453|5.0|Fast delivery.<br />My daughter loves it! very easy to understand for my daughter currently in pre-K.<br />she is 4 and a half years and can understand the point without even need to read it before.<br />Training is one to draw letters in the form of games and drawings.<br />the leaves are easily detachable which is very convenient to give a single worksheet and keep the book full of exercises with exercises to do later.
B009AMAJPA|4.0|Director Niels Arden Oplev did a really sweet job with \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" Though \\"Dead Man Down\\" might not be quite as good, it's still a heck of an outing.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Beatrice (Noomi Rapace) is left scarred after a car accident. She has seen her neighbor, Victor (Colin Farrell), kill someone, so she figures she can hire/blackmail him to kill the guy who ruined her face. Victor, as it turns out, is an enforcer for some bad guys, but they're having their own problems with a mystery person who is sending them cryptic, ominous messages. So how will this all play out?<br /><br />This is a heck of a set-up. Oplev seems to purposely be obscuring location in the beginning. You start with Terrance Howard, an African American, speaking some Latin dialect to some people. Then you have Beatrice's mom speaking French, and Victor speaking Albanian. Maybe he's saying this could be taking place anywhere beside New York. Add to that the Terrance Howard character trying to figure out who's dogging him and why. It took me a while to get my footing. Enter Beatrice and Victor. She's scarred on the outside and he on the inside from an incident that happened some while earlier. And the story itself is pretty cool. As I mentioned, I was pretty wobbly in the beginning. But, piece by piece, the puzzle started coming together both on the plot side as well as the relationship side. I was satisfied.<br /><br />I like Colin Farrell but he (or his agent) has a knack for picking iffy roles. This was a good role for him and he did a sweet job. I've seen Noomi Rapace in a few films and I like her more and more each time I see her. Terrance Howard still fails to impress me. Luckily, he didn't get too much screen time.<br /><br />This is just a good, solid effort. It might not change your life but it should hold your attention for its full duration.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book until the end.  Wish I just left out the last chapter.  But the book is so much better than the movie.  I don't recommend the movie at all.  It left out way too much of the significance of who Pi really is as a spiritual person.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|there are 2 of these items on amazon with vastly different prices. this is cheaper so i worried it wasn't the real collector's edition.<br /><br />well it is.<br /><br />also it has spanish and french subtitles for those who are curious.<br /><br />note this is dvd. the bluray will be 2x as much approx.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved the first book and could not wait to pick up the second.  It did not fail to excite and entertain. It left me excited to read the third book.
B000002KBU|5.0|One of my favorite Joni albums. Just went to a 40th anniversary celebration of its release with each song on the ablum being sung by a different singer...they did a great job and put out an album, but again I wanted the real thing on CD to listen in my car.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan (Two-Disc Special Edition)<br />(1998) Excellent movie.  The DVD was in excellent condition.  I got it for a 10 year old Chinese newcomer who is having difficulty learning English.
B000002KOJ|5.0|Loved this album since 1970's..so great to get it on CD now-to hear in car-a real classic! Few remember that Joni wrote &#34;Both Sides Now&#34; not Judy Collins!
B00881VLCE|3.0|It's a pretty good puzzle app.  Sometimes doesn't load or crashes. Uses up battery very quickly.  I like that you can choose to have rotate on or off and can choose which pieces to pull on the screen.  Comes with enough puzzles, but then have to buy others.  Keeps me going when I can't do an actual puzzle on the table.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this app more than any other on my kindle fire hd. I wouldn't be able to sleep without it!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|There's not much to say except read this book!  It's hard to describe the intricate story without giving things away.  The rich descriptions make me feel as if I'm walking through the tents and wish this kind of place really existed. I can't wait to read more of Morgenstern.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books as I fell in love with Tris and Four and their fight for the truth and freedom and anxiously awaited for the third book to come out. I wish I had stopped with the second book because this book was a huge let down.  It seems like the author was in a hurry to end the series as the story seems rushed and chaotic. The ending really left me sad and upset with much to be desired. If you read this book, be prepared for a bad ending.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The style of this book threw me at first, but I learned to appreciate it as the story develops.  I love the idea of having death as the narrator.  The characters are rich and the story pulls at the heart.  Can't wait to see how they do the movie.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga keeps the momentum going strong on her adventurous roller coaster of a third album. \\"ARTPOP\\" is a giddy, swirling, unfailingly intriguing look through her singular and ever-surprising mind. It is often clever, sometimes eyebrow-raising and always entertaining - descriptions which befit the songstress herself.<br /><br />Rather than simply deliver a collection of chart-aimed retreads of past pop-savvy hits (no one would complain to hear a \\"Poker Face\\" or \\"Love Game\\" soundalike, since those tunes were so strong) Gaga channels her inner Tori Amos for the better part of the album, allowing for an album defined more by eccentricity and insularity than accessibility, even though the likes of \\"Gypsy\\" or previous hits \\"Applause\\" and \\"Do What U Want,\\" both strong indicators of the LP as a whole, are not without strong hooks and radio friendly rhythms.<br /><br />Her declaration of wanting to craft \\"reverse Warhol\\" art with \\"ARTPOP\\" certainly works in that she has designed the album to reach the listener from its surface energy - this is music that makes a blaring, willfully garish, neon-lighted impression on the listener but ultimately leaves her exact intent up to interpretation. Just how tongue-in-cheek are these messages? How much is sarcasm? How much is parody? One thing is certain - Gaga set out to make a record that would get people talking, and she succeeded.<br /><br />Although this is an album more about overall feel than individual moments, \\"Venus\\" and \\"Sexxx Dreams\\" are riper than most of the bunch to arrest clubbers on the dance floor, and \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"G.U.Y.\\" are single material with hooks-a-plenty construction and compelling performances. \\"Swine\\" is giddy fun, the title track is cheeky and slinky with its retro 80s synths, and \\"Dope,\\" written as a repentance from a damaged, downtrodden addict, is a surprisingly powerful ballad. Gaga's cocktail hour vocal is honest and heartfelt.<br /><br />So much is outwardly crass and openly superficial - that is, so 2013 - about \\"ARTPOP,\\" and that appears to be Gaga's superobjective, a writhe commentary in and of itself - as she continually channels her inner Marie Antoinette, hedonistic pleasures battling each other to get to the threshold, she has her cake and eats it, too. She has an album that works as a cultural statement without sacrificing entertainment value, and in so doing justifies her pop culture prominence.o 2013 - about \\"ARTPOP,\\" and that appears to be Gaga's superobjective, a writhe commentary in and of itself - as she continually channels her inner Marie Antoinette, hedonistic pleasures battling each other to get to the threshold, she has her cake and eats it, too.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Deep and inspiring characters. I think the book is worth the read, even though the movie did it great justice.  Delving into two types of people with mental illness and making them relatable while feeling empathy towards them.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I have a couple of pairs of Toms that I had ordered years ago from the Toms website. I wear a size 8 and those Toms were size 8's. They fit perfectly. I ordered a size 8 of the blue ones and brown ones from Amazon.com and both pair were too large! I sent them back and ordered a 7.5 in the blue to make sure they would fit. (Thanks goodness for Amazon's wonderful return policy! Returns are a breeze!)<br />The replacements are sill slightly large but I'll keep them and just wear socks with them. I held the sole of these up to my previous size 8 pair and the size 7.5 is still noticeably longer than the size 8.<br />If you've never owned a pair of Toms before, it's best to order them slightly snug, as they stretch out after just a couple of times wearing them.<br />Now, I'm just keeping an eye on the brown ones to see when the price will go down.(Amazon prices fluctuate, so keep an eye on that too before ordering).<br />Great shoes...great cause...one for one!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson always spins a good yarn, especially when it is history. The interplay between Lindbergh, Ruth, Coolidge, Dempsey and others is fascinating. The little vignettes about unrelated events made the book more interesting. I haven't finished it yet, but know that Bryson will not disappoint.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally . . . the app for Kindle Fire! Waited a long time for this. It did not disappoint. Get yours today.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|How long it's been since I've had the desire to read for days to conclude a volume which called to me to its finish?  In the middle of this book, I emailed friends the name and author with the short subject:  A Book You Will Enjoy!  Alma is the woman we all aspire to be, and also fear we will become. Her life was turbulent, but through the difficult and easy, she remained true to her nature.  I have read all of Elizabeth Gilbert's writings.  She, and her many characters, have touched me--and changed my life for the better. Thank you, Elizabeth Gilbert!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Warning!!!! Once you start you can't stop, you will be hooked the fist time :) My absolute favorite game so far

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Love this book!! I've read this book? Over and over again and am always engrossed by the way Austen portrays her characters.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My nephew was just getting into Legos and he loves Mine Craft so this was a very good choice for his birthday. I thought the pieces were extremely small as were the characters, but he says it was just right!
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|If you want to see a much better version of this, then check out \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\". Great story and lots of action. Just note Olympus Has Fallen is rated R vs this PG-13 mess of a movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted to Spider as it is,  I have been for years.  Great way to relax and unwind. Love touch application for moving cards. Game is fast and fun.  Thanks guys!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was an amazing story. It listed under Young Adult but I think it is really a story for all the ages.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved this. The glamour and the story. I just love romance and tragedy. Do watch it in HD the colors look amazing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great twisted read that keeps you guessing for awhile then blows your mind. You get to hear two sides of what is going on through out the who done it mystery. Even after you realize where Amy is it still keeps you guessing on what will happen next and who will be going down for it. I couldnt put the book down and read the whole thing in 2 days. I would definitely recommend this read to anyone looking for a little bit of crazy and mystery! I hear it will be in theaters in 2014 as well!
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|It was a cool movie. I liked it much better than I thought I would but with that said it could have been a little better.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I have been waiting for the past 2 years and I am so excited that i can sleep in peace now! 13/15 singles in this album have the potentials to be top 10 hits in variety charts: EDM, POP, RnB and hip hop!<br />G.U.Y., Sexx Dreams, Donatella and Gypsy without a doubt gonna be topping the charts around the world!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Some points of law questionable.  The complexity of the storyline was washed out with the sell out of making everyone a winner.  Is this Seth's will?
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is pure talent and brains. she's also a goddess. a must read, for everyone everywhere.<br />oh, and I hear the narrated version is even better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great simple calculator for my kindle fire. It fills up the whole screen nicely no need to squint the numbers are nice and big. Highly recommended.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I got this because a friend of mine has a daughter who does not like hello kitty at all. I thought what better way to annoy her than get her one.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|It was a good movie, however it kept freezing up throughout the movie. Message said loading and it took a very long time. We currently have Netflix and we don't encounter this type of problem.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Need some apps, and occasionally it lags and I have to restart the movie, but other than that, it's a so much more convenient device!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Totally riveting! Best John Grisham to date. He is the master of courtroom drama! And besides that, I like to have my faith in the justice system renewed if only in Grisham's style which cannot be immatated.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Whether or not you believe in God one way that you live after you die is by living in the hearts of the people you left behind. My father lives in me and I hope I can live in the hearts of my children. To the friends, family, and teammates of Adam I would like to thank you for telling this story. I know Adam lives in your hearts and he does in mine as well. I wish I could have had a plate at his table. I got it.
1476712042|1.0|It was really stupid. It seemed a lot like an episode of Dawson's Creek. I thought this was going to be a great sexy romance. However, it was like a teenage /college drama. If you are over the age of 20 you probably won't like it.
0393088804|5.0|Trench warfare in WWI was really horrific. The senseless waste of life to gain a single yard of useless mud was insane. During The Somme, there were about one million casualties on both sides. The gain? About six miles, or what you could walk in a pleasant afternoon.<br /><br />But, still, ah Joe Sacco's wonderful pull out illustrations!  These are as glorious as the battle was horrible. Truly awesome, and have to be seen to be believed. Take a look at the expanded view above, and understand that does not do justice to the real thing by even a little.<br /><br />This is a must for any student or even scholar of The Great War, or those who enjoy such great illustrative work.<br /><br />Amazing!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I keep receiving, &amp;#34;vtube has stopped working&amp;#34; messages and I can't watch any videos because of it. It's very frustrating! This app needs much revision. I wouldn't recommend watching YouTube videos here. Your phone or computer are much better alternatives until they patch this up. And not to mention its flooded with ads at every turn. I've never seen so much advertising on an app. It's pretty ridiculous.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Like the fact that it is interactive. Just right for myself and my preteen granddaughter to have fun playing together.
B00G32TD98|5.0|I must say that this movie is freaking scary! I'm not talking about the no plot cheap thrills scary, I'm talking about a well-written film with good acting with a great director. This is the scariest movie I've seen in a long time and I love the genre and watch almost every horror film that comes out.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|fit perfect no complaints at all!!! I would definitely recommend this .  and I like the foam pads too .
B003B02O0A|5.0|it is funny to write a review about a book which is so old and already with so many reviews. but i read this as a prequel to sycamore row and i was fascinated by the story and the characters therein. particularly jake the young lawyer came alive in this book. made it so much easier to understand him in sycamore row. the book reminded me so much of ' to kill a mocking bird.' but the differences kept me enthralled.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Surprisingly amazed. I bought this book over a month ago. Didn't give it a real chance at first but then once I started I finished in 3 days which is fast when you have a toddler<br /><br />I love the way she wrote mostly. It was a huge difference reading something based in Australia. Especially the dialogue and specific jargon.<br /><br />The ending epilogue is extremely creative and I think it's what we all hope for at the end of a movie. Love the boom. Recommend giving it a shot past the first 5  chapters. Then you won't put it down.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|[[ASIN:0385537131 Sycamore Row]]<br /><br />i feel john grisham should price his books by the number of words in a book! each word is so thought out. how can a civil case be so interesting! amazingly crisp, downright suspense till the end, twists and turns as only he can provide, this book is all that i asked for. felt sorry it ended although i was anxious through to know  how it would end! if there is a next novel i would like to book it now.
1416972250|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of this series.  I am soooo looking forward to finishing the rest of them and to book six next spring!
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is written in a fast paced and interesting way. Characters are memorable and enduring. The underlying themes make this a family story to be treasured.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy it is available on my kindle now. It is a fun game and was sad when I couldn't find it at first in the app store.
B00GFIWWN4|1.0|Paying extra for HD is a rip off. The picture quality was no better than standard definition. I watch through cable modem that tested At 32-35 Mbps while watching. My TV is a 1080p 55&#34; HD. Don't pay for HD.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent read and very thought provoking. I am not sure if I will see the movie though, I would hate to be disappointed.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|It's funny because I like this album a lot more than their last album.  To me, the lyrics have a lot more substance.  And the music is a throwback to the new wave music of the 80s--like the Fixx, Talking Heads, the Cure, New Order,  the Ramones, etc.  It's interesting that bands like Arcade Fire and Mumford & Sons are both quoting the classics in their albums.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This does not work the way it is supposed to.  I tried to watch a movie on my TV with it after buying on Google Play, and the service was so spotty, I had to shut it off and buy via On Demand.  This is a total waste of money.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This works well on kindle fire. Would give it 5 stars if there wasn't levels that are literally impossible or if they would give you occasional free special tools instead of expecting you to buy them. It shouldn't cost to play a game.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|The best tower defense game on the market currently, with consistently fun gameplay throughout its campaign. It is basically the sequel to the original of its name. The only complaint I have about these titles is that the hero characters you can purchase are more expensive than the original game!

B000000XB8|5.0|I remember the first and only tape we used to have growing up was cosmos factory. Riding down the road in our former isuzu trooper we got lost in the cassette recording every time. Credence never got old for us. The tape just got better like a fine wine. Even though I grew up in the late eighties the album left quite an impression on me and my music tastes for the rest of my life to be.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It says you have to leave a 5star comment for a bonus level. Overwrought, gets you your worms fix, that old game of lobbing grenades at your friends. I just wish it was a button you hit to shoot because sometimes when you try to look around he shoots and misses.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|This is a book that will stay with you.  You don't really understand what is going until the last part of the book.  The end is fitting for Alex.

B000B8L6LI|4.0|This sharpening system worked very well on my hunting knives as I only needed the three hones . I was wondering about the quality of Lansky because of such a cheap price but I was pleasantly surprised although you do get what you paid for this system worked for me .

B009APMNB0|3.0|I've been using the Pantone huey 1.0.5 to calibrate my monitor for many years.  However, I was interested in trying the color munki smile since it is what now seems to be the most recommended since the huey 1.0.5 is no longer available.  Also, it is not necessary to stick anything to the screen like it is with the huey.<br /><br />The user guide that comes with the unit is very clear, very easy to follow the steps to install the software.  Had to click a number of times to open the installer and get the software installed, but once it was, the process of using the Smile to calibrate the monitor was well presented.<br /><br />Calibrating takes considerably longer than it does with the huey 1.0.5.  I did not clock it, but it took 3-4 times longer than with the huey.<br /><br />Time to calibrate the monitor would not be an issue if the calibration was done well.  However, when completed there was a slight pink cast.  The photos were pleasing to the  eye, but you sensed there was slight pink cast, which was confirmed when I held a white handkerchief close to the monitor.  It appeared slightly pinkish.<br /><br />I then calibrated the monitor using the huey 1.0.5 and, when calibration complete, gave it the handkerchief test.  This  time the handkerchief remained white.<br /><br />Based on my experience, I will continue to use the huey 1.0.5.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is GREAT! It is terribly addictive. I do hate that you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can continue playing but it is a VERY small detail. I love this game!
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|If it weren't for the wonderful acting, personality, and charisma of Martin Freeman this movie would be completely unwatchable. The greedy Hollywood money sucking machine decided to turn what should have been a wonderful and perfect classic into a Trilogy instead of just one great movie. To extend a script that wasn't there they just inserted more and more fighting, chopping, slashing, stabbing, spearing, punching, running, hiding violent torturous scenes. There was almost no story to this waste of my time movie. Greed destroys everything, movies, government, the world. The producers and director of this movie should be ashamed. When all three movies finally come out then someone should take them and recut them into one good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing against Facebook friends and family  I loved passing people in the game I'm hoping to try there new one
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very droll and amusing tale, a novel in the British style of humor.  Totally outrageous tale, an enjoyable read of the first degree.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very entertaining you can play it for hours and it continues to grow overnight.  Pretty fun to play when you have 15 min of down time
0770437400|1.0|Terrible book... boring, cliched, could NOT finish it. I tried three times to get through it. About halfway through I just gave up.<br /><br />The people giving it 4 or 5 stars must be 12 year olds. I mean SERIOUSLY??<br /><br />I love zombie books / movies. I love war books / movies. World War Z was neither, it was just daft.<br /><br />Instead try &#34;The Road&#34; (book or movie), &#34;The Book of Eli&#34; (movie), &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; (comic or TV show). For war stuff, there are a thousand better books and movies than this junk.
B007XC9BSK|4.0|My son loves this.  Just to be clear though, this is just the display truck - no drifter cars are included.  But its a cute way to keep them all together.  He doesn't really use the release hatch in the back.  He also needs help to open the clear panel, which I like because he can't just open it and dump them out anywhere.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book really depressed me, the ending ruined all of the book for me. Love good books hate bad endings . Blah
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan is a master of character development and a master story teller, and in her latest historical fiction novel, The Valley of Amazement, she takes these skills to new heights while bridging the gap between western and Asian culture, placing her in the realm of artists like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Joyce, and Faulkner.<br /><br />No author paints the psychological struggle between strong willed mother/daughter pairs better than Tan, and the story unfolds between a privileged Chinese-American girl, Violet, and her American mother, Lucia, who operates a first class courtesan house in old Shanghai during the fall of the Ching Dynasty.  Lucia is cruelly deceived by one of her lovers and confidants who sells fourteen-year-old Violet to a second rate courtesan house as Lucia, thinking Violet is already on board, boards a ship for San Francisco to escape the political turmoil of the era.<br /><br />The story covers both Violet and Lucia and examines their lives in minute detail, particularly focusing on the choices they make concerning their mothers and all the men in their lives.<br /><br />Unlike her other novels, Tan fully develops the sexual nature of her main characters in this book, which adds to the psychological richness of the story.  Her strong point is the creation of characters, so real, so believable, so human, that the reader will feel as if she knows these people--the mark of a great writer.<br /><br />This is the pinnacle work of Amy Tan to date, and it is a journey all serious readers should take.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|Ever see the 3D version of Tic Tac Toe on Star Trek? This is a mobile phone/tablet version of the game - and it works well. While not as \\"futuristically\\" designed as the one on tv, this 4 x 4 x 4 grid does a great job of letting you experience the challenge of thinking in 3 dimensions to strategically place your markers to get 4 in a row. It is fun, but it does get boring after a while.<br /><br />I have seen the comment about potential ad/survey info that may be utilized by this game, however I did not see any ads, so I'm not sure about it. I'm taking off 1 star, though, since the quote on a previous reviewer's post is really from the company and it does lead the average person to believe their info is not completely safe. On the other hand I really can't negate a good game for some suspicions, so I'm only dropping it by one star.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend getting this game while it is free. It may not really be worth $3, but if it goes to 99 cents or less, it is a good time waster.
B00BVYR6YW|5.0|Orphan black is an extraordinary show that's easily the best new show of the last few years. I don't want to ruin the joy of discovery so I'll just say that this is a show to start watching as unspoiled as possible. It's dark, sexy, thrilling and smart. In spite of what a few reviewers have suggested, it's actually slyly funny and sometimes hilarious. Don't avoid watching out of fear it's depressing and downbeat; the characters are easier to root for than you might think. Definitely check it out.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I have not used it yet, going on vacation in 2 day's hope to use it then, and if I like it I will change the rating.......

B00BSB2AE4|5.0|To start, I like this Alot!  There are others out there, but this is my favorite one...<br /><br />The real question is WTF is wrong with me that I curled up in a ball laughing so hard?  There is a tortured soul of genius at work here, and if you an relate you should see your health care provider.  Fans of the blog will find some old favorites accompanied by new material mixed together in a blender and served straight up in a must buy.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am happy that Candy Crush is available on Kindle.  Fun but challenging and frustrating at times if toy don't want to make in game purchases, but it can be done.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|a really great game.  very well done and so original.  great puzzles to solve which are challenging but not impossible.  would highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this puzzle, it makes you have to think pretty hard to find everything you need to (leave the room) It's great for kids and adults. I'm 28 and still going it quite hard at times lol But that's what makes you want to keep going.I live these types of games. The only thing is I wish there were more rooms cuz I'm craving more now. Very nice app What's better than making you work for success !

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Got this game a few days ago and I'm glad I did. fun and just challenging enough to keep it interesting.
1476712042|1.0|I was shocked that there were so many five star reviews calling Travis their \\"dream guy\\" and \\"book boyfriend\\". Really? You want a guy who doesn't let you dress the way you want to? Who gets jealous if you go out without him? Who hits people in the face if another guy looks at you? People cheering for two 18 year olds to get married? Ugh.<br /><br />Mediocre writing, terrible character development, and just an all around terrible message for women.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is must-have add-on for any one with a Nikon DSLR who takes pictures inside. Period. And it's portable.<br /><br />Why? The on-camera flash will work but don't expect stellar results, the SB-400 will allow you to direct the flash up to 90 degrees -- straight up.  I'm only just learning how to use bounce flash effectively but after a weekend of heavy shooting with the SB-400 it has already paid for itself.<br /><br />Skip the newer SB-300, it's smaller, less powerful and uses AAA instead of the AA's on the SB-400.  I'd recommended picking up some NiMH AA's -- they provide more stable and generally longer lasting power than alkaline.<br /><br />The only only downside I can see is it only has one axis, up or down -- when you shoot in portrait mode bounce flash will be coming from the side.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Best rock album of 2013. From front to back, this is an album. Not many bands put a full album together, but Avenged Sevenfold does this. Hail to the King is the #1 song off this with #3 right behind it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really do like this game because it works from babies to teens and also adults for entertainment also it's a fun way to earn new blades and more star fruit. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.

B0007LGCB8|4.0|I purchased these for general purpose sandals and I'm mostly happy with them.  They seem well constructed and they are fairly comfortable.  I have two nits:<br /><br />1) They are pretty tight fitting against the feet.  The tightness of the back strap is not adjustable at all, and the adjustment of the front is minimal via the draw string.  At first I found this uncomfortable and got some chaffing of my skin due to the friction, but I got used to it after awhile.  I imagine if you're looking for something you can wear for athletic purposes they would be great, as they're quite snug.<br /><br />2) The foot pad is recessed a bit so if you get a rock or something in them it probably isn't going to come out without taking the sandal off.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|My friend loves Doctor Who and got me into it and it's awesome!<br /><br />And we're going to watch this movie at his upcoming birthday party!<br /><br />I mean, the 10th AND 11th Doctor. C'mon now, that's too awesome.<br /><br />I am so excited!!
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|This is the best Iron Man yet. The graphics and Robert Downey, Jr. Are truly amazing. A must have Iron Man
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun, challenging, and all the other superlatives reviewers have used.  This is the only game of its type  I play; usually I like knowledge-based games, such as jeopardy or American history quiz.  Angry Birds left me cold, as did many other games my friends recommended.  This game is truly perfect for everyone.
B000I8G5C6|5.0|Love this movie. Love Will Smith. Perfect for a paper on interpersonal communications or relationships. Funny and witty as always.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is great. Constantly being asked for money to continue is not.  Time outs if you don't pay $.99 is a pain.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great but needs more &#34;channels&#34; and options ..Its a great start and hope to continue to add viewing options.
0062107313|5.0|There is sadness in every life and unforeseen joys and tragedies. Amy Tan narrates these and more in her book THE VALLEY OF AMAZEMENT. This is a story of mother and daughter and the lives they lead. The settings are San Francisco and Shanghai. Many are the heartaches as well as great courage and persistence. Those who people the story are noble and vile as well. Charlatans hide among those who love well. Violet and Lulu both experience this. This book is filled with interesting details and sage observations of others. It likewise shows the human tendency to want others to be who we want them to be. One could rarely find a tome such as this. It is a lengthy book that draws you in rather quickly. After a while you can't put it down as you are drawn into the livee and thoughts of the characters. Amy Tan has outdone herself in this book which also has many shocking surprises.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It did not work on my kindle fire HD as the alarm was too soft to be heard otherwise it is &#34;fine&#34;.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|The book is interesting, but certainly not uplifting, as it describes a gruesome and senseless murder.  It also describes a city on the brink, with folks knowing they are about to be attacked, but lacking the ability or will to leave.  I learned more about the lead up to WW II from this book.  Always interesting, and instructive as we think about current events and our responses to them.
B00594XOZU|1.0|this site allows teens to go on and meet other &#34;teens&#34; who are likely to be old men sitting in their underwear.......they ask for names pics etc right off the bat..beware parents

B003G4W49C|4.0|The main reason I read this book was so I could see the movie.  It's a fast read with quirks and turns that are unexpected.  A little short, I prefer books 500 pages and up, but would recommend it to my friends
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun for my nephews and a good way of unwinding, although it isn't that amazing it's still fun and entertaining.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is an easy to play app with great graphics. The tiles are large and colorful, making them easy to see.  The game is stimulating, but not difficult, and so completing one of the puzzles is fun.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this app to anyone looking for  some relaxing enjoyment.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I upgraded to the payed version and i mean any song you can think of this app has a strong likely to have it. video game music, movie music, even some hip hop, Nd classical can be found in this app. not only that but it will teach you to play that song too. its fun and worth the money. a great app.

B00GBCMW9S|3.0|It's interesting to read the wildly differing opinions on Eminem's newest effort The Marshall Mathers LP 2.  Newsday believes that the album doesn't work as its intended sequel to 2000's The Marshall Mathers LP.  The Daily Beast treats it as nothing more than a reminder of the fact that Em has done better work, and that this isn't it.  Entertainment Weekly also wasn't thrilled with the album, giving it a C+ overall.<br /><br />But hey, NPR has Em's back (for the most part), and that should tell you something.  And Rolling Stone likes it...I think.  Once these two judges are holding up their 8.0 cards, there's really no need to check in with anyone else.<br /><br />Eminem is such a lyrical genius that to even attempt to review his work is intimidating.  If this was the end of \\"8 Mile\\" and we saw him standing there, we'd just drop the mic and leave with our tails between our legs.<br /><br />That being said, let's attempt to dissect The Marshall Mathers LP 2.  First, it has to be said: the title hurts the album.  Sequels naturally lend themselves to being vulnerable as comparisons to their predecessors, and Eminem has progressed so strongly and consistently in the years post-The Marshall Mathers LP (with the exception of the slight hiccup that was 2009's Relapse, which was quickly rectified [and apologized for] via the appropriately-named Recovery in 2010) that for him to tie new material to a 2000 album seems like he's doing himself a disservice.  (Did we really need a sequel to \\"Stan\\"?)<br /><br />The Marshall Mathers LP was brilliant.  It was here that we began to take Eminem more seriously as an artist, as opposed to just a naughty cartoon animated by Dr. Dre.  Here, we had an updated Beastie Boy - a white-boy rapper who was easy on the eyes and who could hold his own when the odds were clearly not in his favor.  The problem is that because LP was so innovative, its sequel could only suffer by comparison.<br /><br />Recovery is arguably Eminem's best album of all time.  It featured Em's killer collaborations with artists like P!nk and Rihanna, and it was brutally honest without making the listener uncomfortable - a delicate balance that Em doesn't always strike so perfectly, and that he often misses here.<br /><br />For one thing, in light of the recent strides same-sex marriage has made in the years since Recovery's release, people are less open to Em's choice of words when he continues to add \\"fa**ot\\" to his lyrics.  Em has defended his use of the word in that it isn't meant as a derogatory term for a sexual preference, but people don't want to hear it.  They believe that it's hateful, outdated, and unnecessary.<br /><br />While these folks may find Em to be stagnant, he actually shows emotional growth at several points on this album.  \\"Headlights\\" is especially surprising, as Em takes this opportunity to apologize to his mother, Debbie Mathers, for ripping her a new one so publicly in the past.  Apparently, he regrets writing \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" and won't even play it in concert anymore.  This is disappointing, as I was one proud college freshman the day my mom told me she liked that song - oh, the irony.<br /><br />When Em becomes reflective, it feels bittersweet.  You're proud of him for overcoming his demons but at the same time, if you haven't yet overcome your own, you're sad that he can no longer relate to yours.  It's sobering to hear him rap about his doubts as to whether or not he was ever meant to be a father, since all we've heard him do for years is defend his girls to the death.<br /><br />Em's samples of The Zombies' \\"Time of the Season\\" (\\"Rhyme or Reason\\") and Billy Squier's \\"The Stroke\\" (\\"Berzerk\\") need multiple listens for a determination of whether or not they work.  Em's samplings aren't usually this tough to follow.  \\"Survival\\" (a.k.a. the \\"Call of Duty\\" track) kicks ass, but I am partial to his arena rap-rock.  Missing from many of these songs is Em's familiar acid-spitting, though when he does bring his old ire out to play on songs like \\"Rap God\\" or \\"Berzerk,\\" it feels less like he's rallying the troops and more like he's trying to prove he's still got it.<br /><br />The problem is that The Marshall Mathers LP 2 delves even deeper into the remorseful ditch that Recovery had already started digging.  Eminem feels less like that ticking time bomb who's destined to sit in the back of a police car and more like the ex-con who feels contrition for the actions that put him there.ring his old ire out to play on songs like \\"Rap God\\" or \\"Berzerk,\\" it feels less like he's rallying the troops and more like he's trying to prove he's still got it.<br /><br />The problem is that The Marshall Mathers LP 2 delves even deeper into the remorseful ditch that Recovery had already started digging.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Thanks Dear Sean Patrick,<br /><br />Through this book, it is my pleasure to know that there was someone who wanted to do something for global success. You have really put forwards the true meaning of creativity and process. It has really helped me understand it. Unfortunately, before going through this book, I was always thinking in a wrong way that the creativity, geniusness and imagination are birth gift.  But fortunately, after reading this piece of writing, I am thinking in a completely new direction and with new height of energy.<br /><br />I am excited to read your other book Awakening Your Inner Genius.<br /><br />Thanks a lot,
B00F3VOL38|3.0|If you remove the interviews and the duplicates from volume one, this easily could have fit on one disc!  However, after a first casual listen the songs that are not repeats are great to hear. And the booklet is Fab! Can't wait to find Kevin Howlett's new Beatles at the BBC book waiting for me under the Christmas Tree! I still need to do a more thorough side-by-side comparison of the duplicate tracks. (I know, I know, they are different performances, not duplicates. But do we really need two versions of Til There Was You?) Maybe I will amend my review after a few more listens. One big plus was I received my Amazon pre-order today, one day before the official release date!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's been a very popular aspect of our semi-weekly board game night. Sometimes between turns someone will play a video from Youtube just for fun, and it makes for a pretty good addition for the night. Otherwise, my wife and I like to use it to watch content from Netflix as well. It works very well as advertised, so long as you understand that going outside of what's advertised isn't guaranteed to work as well as you might like.<br /><br />The device itself does not have any sort of permanent memory for apps, instead it loads them on demand, usually taking about 3 to 5 seconds to load the Netflix or Youtube apps. It can cause some hiccups and glitches if you try to load a video while it's downloading the app, but otherwise works very smoothly if you allow it those few seconds at first. The device itself streams content directly from those sites, so you can queue up content from low end devices without any playback problems.<br /><br />The desktop casting does leave much to be desired, and I haven't been able to get the audio to work; though, it's not an advertised feature and is clearly marked as experimental. The Tab-Casting on the other hand works great, given you have a good enough computer to handle streaming content smoothly (we have a computer that we built for about $1,000 last year, works great on that. Our other computer would probably be worth about $350 today, and it stutters with video and audio gets out of sync). The Tab-Casting feature allows you to play anything you can open in your browser on your television, at least, we haven't run into anything that causes problems thus far. If you have the proper plugins, this will allow you to play video content from your computer and stream it to your television, or any number of creative ideas you might have.<br /><br />The Youtube app works well from all of the devices our friends have: Android phones, iPad, Laptops/Desktops (Linux and Windows). We haven't tried it from anything else, but I imagine they work just as well. You can queue videos from several devices and the Chromecast will play them in the order they were requested in. This means that you and your friends can add videos to a playlist as someone else's video is playing. One thing to keep in mind, once Youtube on your device syncs up with the Chromecast, it will display controls for the current video on your device, sometimes causing people to accidentally queue the current video up again or restart it from the beginning. It's mostly corrected if you give it a few seconds to get situated and make sure you're actually doing what you think you're doing.<br /><br />The Netflix app is similar to the Youtube app, though it does not have a queue. It does have a few more issues, though I believe those are mostly related to the fact that the Netflix app for phones is a resource hog, it works great once you can actually send the video request to the Chromecast device. So it's not really an issue with the Chromecast itself, but with the Netflix app on your phone. There is only a slight latency (less than 1 second unless you're having network issues) with the controls for a playing video, though it can be irritating to try to get the controls to come back up if you close out of the netflix app, once again, an issue with the Netflix app on your phone.<br /><br />I don't buy music or videos from the Google Play store, so I haven't tested that out. I imagine it works well.<br /><br />As far as I know, anyone can make an app for the device to play content. However, I would warn people from making a purchase based on future promises from other content providers. Until they actually have an app, you should consider it to be nothing more than a possibility. The Tab-Casting can make up for an app not being available, but having a Chromecast app is superior.<br /><br />Overall, I've been very happy with the device.

B00992CF6W|5.0|MCPE is a awesome game first day i had it i did not want<br />get off i do not care if it cost 7 dollers
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is so cool because you can create so many things and you can play on external and realms servers. Why I only have four stars, not five, is because the updates for minecraft always come out really late. I am super exited for 0.8.0 which is supposed to come out this month but it will probably only come out in January for the kindle fire... Also my sister and I both have Kindle Fires and this game you cannot decide when to update it just happens when it does and then mine or hers will update first then we cannot play together :(  in other  app stores you can decide to update but when 0.6.1 came out our house was destroyed from our sand roof and that house had chickens and diamonds in it! But all together the app itself it really fun but the amazon app store needs to keep up with the updates. I think this  is the top paid app so they should keep consumers happy. Have fun with the app! :)
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|When I first heard this new album on ITunes, I thought good, but not great. However, after listening to it a few times, there are many songs on this that I love. My favorite is, Do What You Want With My Body, featuring R. Kelly. The other songs which I love are: Artpop, Sexxx Dreams, Gypsy, Aura, Venus, and of course Applause. So, in my opinion 7 great songs on an album is pretty damn good. Now that's not saying the other songs are bad. Songs such as: Swine, Mancure, and Dope are also very good. So now we have 10 really good songs out of the fifteen tracks. Fashion and G.U.Y are okay. The remaining songs are what disappoint me. If I was Gaga I would have cut them completely out of this album and then you would have had a masterpiece. But, I don't mind fast forwarding through a few tracks, especially that one with Drugs and Something or other... I hate the song so much that the name escapes me. Donatella, she is screaming and something about Mary Jane??? Why?? So, 12 out of 15 isn't bad. There will be lots of hits here. Gaga is back and I applaud her on a job well done. She gets a standing ovation from me.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This is as if he followed my life around and decided to make songs that were exactly what I was going through. You can tell that he is getting back to what made his so great in the past. Perfect follow up to Recovery. Rest assured you want more like this.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|My mom says using the word &quot;hate&quot; is to explicit, but I think hate is the perfect word for this app, and I have 5 reasons to hate it.<br /><br />1. Having to move the piano to get to other keys is time wasting<br />2. &quot;You need the diamond pack for this&quot; is agitating to see every time you press a button<br />3.maybe this is just me but I was looking forward to better piano songs<br />4. Apps pop up in the middle of you playing a song, that's annoying<br />5. Does not teach how to play the piano (I wasn't expecting it to do that though...)
B002N14GPE|5.0|What can I say...This picture got my attention and kept it,I was amazed with the plot line.I can see this movie repeatedly and never tire of it.I have a caution for any one getting the dvd to not look at the out takes...I wish I hadn't seen them because it tainted the movie<br />for me. I hope in time I forget what I saw, some things just need to be left alone.<br />  In what I just said may make you wonder what did she see, you control you and you purchased this dvd so of course you can look<br /> but it isn't worth the look in my Opion.Also there must be three people playing the orphan she looks different three times in thus movie.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I don't really enjoy this game and here's three reasons why;<br /><br />1. Pay money to get more of this and that not really my thing I'm more of a frugal person<br /><br />2.you have to have Facebook and Twitter accounts to do certain things and I'm not allowed to have social networks<br /><br />3.easy for kids (in this case my younger brother) to buy something with a touch of a button<br /><br />  It's a nice game just has some flaws
B009A87ZKG|5.0|This is THE version to get, the one that has the flag on the background, not the other blu ray, for this has the latest and greatest picture of all home video versions.  I have had this movie on Betamax, VHS, DVD and now Blu Ray and it has NEVER looked better, even when I saw it in the cinema, IMHO.<br />The restoration is top notch and the colors look very lifelike, with a depth to the picture that I have not seen since seeing this in the theater. The film itself is great, with good writing and the acting by Scott, Malden and all the other actors are all pretty much top notch. This truly is an American epic and Patton would never fit in today's PC brigade, but he took order, motivated his troops, won battles and alarmed the enemy. Patton really did love war, God help him. But he was damned effective at winning war as well.  Today our administration purges command that does not dovetail with their philosophy, but once upon a time in America, the ability to win was prized.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I did overall enjoy this book and it's educational information. However a lot of it is common sense wrapped into words. Most everyone already knows the things expressed in this book. So I decided to give the book 3 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Just started, it's addicting.  I hope I get more skilled soon so I do t keep running out of lives
B00DW1WR14|5.0|This is the best rock album I have heard all year. After Soundgardens lackluster re-entry last year I wasn't holding out much hope, until I heard Sirens and instantly I was curious. Eddies writing is at its finest in this release and the band offer up a refreshing somber tone in accompaniment. The record feels very personal and wreaks of many different inspirations. From folk, classic rock n roll, electronic and even a touch of country. The first PJ album in many years that I can sit through without skipping a track. The low point for me was the first single Mind Your Manners, but honestly even that song has grown on me a bit. It's like 1998 all over again and I said the same thing about Do The Evolution. Great job and heavily recommended.
B00EAH3D6C|3.0|Mme Dessay disappoints in this pop release. Instead of her usual brilliant coloratura voice we hear the voice somewhat drained of color in mostly straight tone without vibrato and sounding a bit harsh in the close miking of the recording. The piano background with Legrand is well done but thin sounding compared to lush orchestrations which we normally hear in his music. It is a pleasure to hear Dessay's clear French diction. However, her tentative interpretation of &#34;Papa Can You Hear Me?&#34; does not come close to Streisand's original Yentl rendtion full of emotion. Likewise her somewhat hurried rendition of the theme from &#34;Les parapluies de Cherbourg&#34; does not erase memories of the achingly wistful original soundtrack recording with Catherine Deneuve. Contributions from baritone Laurent Naouri and soprano Patricia Petibon on two of the songs do little to help the mood. There's a certain harshness to the sound. On first hearing, casual listeners in the other room said this recording was annoying. For the best from this beloved soprano, listen to her fabulous &#34;The Miracle of the Voice&#34; from Virgin Classics.
0679805273|5.0|Bought this for a baby shower, all who read it loved the message it gave.  I would suggest this book for all baby showers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love love love this game! Glad I can finally play it on my Kindle. It is so addicting and fun. Awesome!
006202406X|1.0|I can't express how disappointing this book was any better than some of the other reviews.  I don't understand why this book was even written.  I realize why it alternates between two character voices, but there is no difference between the two and you would never know which is which if it didn't say at the beginning of the chapter.  The first half is boring and senseless and the ending is probably one of the most unsatisfying endings I've ever read.  Divergent was such a great story with complex, well-developed characters.  I can't believe this is the way it ends.
B0045HCJG2|4.0|Great Stallone movie, kinda cheesy but just what you expect! Brought back memories of the first time I saw it.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I LOVE Avenged Sevenfold. Item arrived in great condition and I'm very pleased. I wish the bonus soundtrack was included on the actual CD but I'm sure Amazon has nothing to do with that.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Yet another great product from Google. I just wish this product had teh capability of direct mirroring of my devices
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Smith's writing has such an easy-going conversational tone that I finished the book without realizing I was at the end. Can't wait to read the next in the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a interesting game<br />the levels train your mind as thee get harder its good excersise for the mind<br /><br />I. recommend this
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Gave as a gift and the teen loved it!  Being a classic, it was fun to have a teen enjoy it so much.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|This is a must listen to album for anyone remotely interested in top quality music. Derek Truck's skill on guitar marks him as one of the best current guitarists (almost untouched by his prowess with his slide), and is reminiscent of the late Duane Allman. There is no wonder as to why Already Free has garnered a Grammy. Fantastic songs, beautifully composed, you would be missing out on a landmark piece of music. Outstanding music for the hardcore blues/music enthusiasts and still can be enjoyed by even casual listeners. Highly recommend this listening experience.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|A good read that kept me interested.  It did get a bit tedious at times.  There was a tendency to be able to &#34;guess&#34; what was coming.  Perhaps I read too many mysteries.
B000W453KQ|2.0|This movie was choppy and sloppy.  I have no idea why this is considered a classic.  Robert Redford was flat and uninteresting.  Barbara did fine.  She'd sometimes put on some BS East Coast accent that would come and go.  The worst of it is the script.  It's impossible to follow the story.  There are so many gaps in it.  All in all, it left me kind of empty.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Just 're read this to get reacquainted as  I start  Grisham's  next book based on characters from this book<br />I think this first novel is his all time best and I was just as riveted now as the first Rome<br /><br />T

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Perfect codition! Fatastic film! Looks brilliant on blu ray! Must buy! Id hold out on a price drop, I only got it bc it was a birthday present.. Cant afford these expensive blu rays unfortuantely.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Anyone know why I cannot advance past level 35? Keeps bringing me back to that level. I am playing on my Kindle Fire, I am not on facebook.<br />thank you
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like the variety and the difficulty level. I is so addictive I forget my troubles for a while.  I also love the easy to see gtaphics.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I enjoyed the book; however there were parts that I could not identify with because I'm American and Bridget Jones<br />is British.  Different cultures.
039916409X|5.0|I was a bit suspicious when I first picked up this book, but after one read I was convinced that these tools can work for the person who actually uses them regularly. They helped me overcome some of my mental blocks and limitations, and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in attracting prosperity. Review submitted by Eddie Coronado, author of the Amazon.com book titled \\"Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets\\"
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't know how I could have lived without this little miracle :) Works perfectly without any issues. Very easy to use
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was really good thought , provoking.. What would you do? It's doesn't let you rush to the end but makes you pay attention to the details .
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I do not have time for Facebook or anything like it. I got this for my granddaughter and she is too young for facebook.
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|John Rebus is back again, again, but this time he's back on the police force and demoted down to DS, which his friend and comrade Siobhan, now a DI, likes to remind him of every so often.  In jest of course.<br /><br />He's really on form this time and I loved every minute of it.  As ever, the plot revolves around current events that concern Scotland but with a killer plot to go with it.  I liked that Rebus and Fox join forces, I wondered when that would happen and I hope that they continue to have adventures in the future as Fox just got a whole lot cooler.  I hope the three of them stick around for a while, at least until Rebus finally retires, as Edinburgh will be a safer place with them around!<br /><br />It's the little details that I love - Rebus is like a bloodhound when he's on a case but can also provide with some light relief, such as his insistence on biscuits in a meeting or asking out a woman in the most inopportune moment.  You get to know the other characters quickly and then you rattle on with the plot, intelligent but without too much navel gazing.  And you always know exactly what car everyone is driving as well, you can tell a lot about someone by the car they drive.<br /><br />This is a rattlingly good story and November is now my favourite month, because it means there's another Rankin ready to download!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Really good reference. I like the way it stores bookmarks. The only problem I had with it is that my Kindle only has wireless and if I am not where there is transmission, I can't read it. I will probably buy an ebook.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I was looking forward to this game being released on Kindle Fire.  I play on my iPhone but would love to be able to play it on a larger screen.  Imagine my surprise when I find out it's been released but it will not work on my Fire.  If you are going to release a game for the Fire, it needs to be compatible with ALL FIRES!  I own the 1st edition Fire and I do not plan to waste money upgrading to a newer version when the one I just purchased 2 years ago works just fine.  So please Amazon.  Try to make all your customers happy, not just the ones who buy the latest and greatest devices you come out with.<br /><br />If this game becomes available for my Fire, I will upgrade my rating.<br /><br />Edit:  I must admit I had no plans to upgrade my Fire until I played with the HDX at Best Buy a couple of weeks ago.  My husband purchased the 8.9\\" version for me.  I downloaded this game and I love it.  Works great, have had no complaints about it.  I love being able to play on a bigger screen.  I've had no lag in loading like I sometimes had on my phone. I still believe the publisher should have either made it available for all Fire operating systems or Amazon should upgrade the firmware on the original Fire. I understand why they don't do that but it kinda sucks for those owners which included me up until a week ago.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to download this game. It's great.
B00F5HWC7W|5.0|If you are new to The Killers or you are just starting out as a fan then this is the album for you! The album has a great selection of tracks from their previous albums plus a couple new ones that are sure to impress. What are you waiting for? Pick it up!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love using the calculator plus free because it's very easy to use and convenient. I recommend this app because it is one of the best calculator apps on the market.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank God. I have been waiting years for them to put Candy Crush on kindle fire. So happy they did:)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My wife turned me onto candy crush, now we are both addicted.  Highly do not recommend unless you want hours of endless fun and satisfaction.
0803731094|5.0|Rhyming text, beautiful realistic pictures, subtle advice!  What more can I say except that the children love it and want it reread every day!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging enough to be very fun and easy enough to figure out. Love it.  Should make more games like this.
B008MM9630|4.0|Hard to move things around.<br />I am just starting but like it so far.<br />You do not need to spendnmoney.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This movie is funny, clever and I like it more every time I watch it. That's saying something because I have watched it a lot.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a good game. It is well made and addictive. I like it it is a good game if u need something to do. Overall good game
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Having a LOT of setup issues. My tablet won't connect so i had to buy a dongle for my PC despite my wireless router. Too simplified for my tastes and i hear it doesn't support a lot to watch atm. The silky packaging kept my from using it for a while, so attractive, nice accessories and lucky i have a USB port to power it (barely mentioned before purchase).
B00B2PHSIY|1.0|This product works fine, but the price is outrageous.  They were selling this a few months back for $8.00.  Even that's high for a simple piece of plastic.  I'm guessing it costs as much to make this as it does the lid on an plastic water bottle, so that's a 50,000% markup right?  Sheesh, can't anybody undercut these clowns?
B002G1K82Q|3.0|First off I must confess that I do not like the beatles but I do love musicals.<br /><br />This one us a love story about an English youth who looks for his dad but finds love in the USA instead.<br /><br />I have long wanted to see this and it was worth the wait.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|Honestly,  I really like this game. But sometimes it exits out on me. That's why I gave it four stars. But its a great game. its kid friendly. my little sister plays this game,  and she loves it!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|This extended edition adds two more sings and extra footage we fans will love. I am not sure if it is worth double dipping but we knew it was coming out by now. I enjoyed the goblin town song most of all.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Blu-Ray doesn't have as nice of a box set as the extended DVDs did.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|I really liked this book because it talks about philosophical beliefs. I really like to think about philosophical beliefs and this book creates an existentialist character that at first is hard to like, but as the book goes on you realize that's just what an existentialist person is like. I highly recommend this book if you like to learn and ponder philosophical beliefs.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A definite read for a young adult. Provides insight into the requirements of commitment that gives one with a sense of purpose.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book took a significant change from the first! Loving this series! Disappointed it's all most over!!! Looking forward to the final book.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|All of the tracks really show new things Gaga has brought to the table. I can't really find any fillers on this album. Great job, Gaga. She did it again.
1401224792|4.0|I wouldn't say that this is the best Fables graphic novel, however, despite the fact that it's not the best it is still entertaining. Especially if you're a reader who likes Bigby. While the story may be lacking in some respects, I think that Bigby has some great moments in it. Unfortunately, many of the other characters come across as rather 2 dimensional and shallow in comparison. I do think that it's interesting that the writer connected this story to events from earlier issues. Though, you can read and enjoy it without having read other issues since the backstory is filled in well enough. However, if you want to avoid any possible spoilers then a good place to read it is around vol. 16 of the regular series. Since I collect the Fables books, I am glad that I went ahead and purchased this one. But I think that when you compare Werewolves of the Heartland to some of the other books (like the fabulous 1001 Nights of Snowfall) it just comes off as merely good, not great. Still, I feel like it's worth the read if you enjoy these books and like this character.
030796695X|5.0|Great book and I LOVE Scott Brick as the narrator. If you're an A's fan, or even a baseball fan, it's worth listening to.
140123769X|5.0|Wow. What can I say? This is a very strong story. It's beautifully written and it tugged at my heartstrings in a big way. I've enjoyed this series for a long time, but I, like other readers, felt a bit of a lull through the past few volumes. I feel like this one not only breaks that lull and gets things back on track, it also establishes itself as being an unforgettable story. Fairy tales aren't always gentle. They can be harsh sometimes. This volume hammers that home.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I liked the movie a lot, but I love this sound track. I listen to it every time I need to just melt away the stress from a rough week at work.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|As someone who's managing a remote team, I'd love to hear more tips about working remotely. This book spends at least half of the volume to convince that remote working is here to stay. However it is a no brainer for me. All I wanted to know is how to effectively manage, which consisted about 2 pages of this book.
1401235425|5.0|why anybody would rate this a 2 or a 1 is beyond me, if you are a batman fan you will definitely enjoy this! a little nerve wrecking at times, but it's testimony to the writing abilities of Mr. Scott Snyder it had me on the edge of my seat many times. A good blend of action and suspense with plenty of substance. I can't wait to fallow up with the other volumes.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best game I have ever had it is so fun I can not believe it. But it also really sucks every thing you have to buy is so over priced.
B00FAIPDAE|1.0|everything was going good but then I was asked if I wanted an update and when it was finished I had to start the game over
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Best game ever. Tower defence, strategy, great graphics, and enough action to keep you on your toes. This game has it all. By far the best game EVER.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|One of the best Disney movies of all time. It's probably in the top 10 conversation. Probably Disney's best 3D movie since Pixar is another division.
006202406X|1.0|This is the most disappointed I've been in a book ever.<br /><br />I found it hard to read, as the the book alternated between the viewpoint of Tris and Tobias every other chapter.<br /><br />I also feel that the author let me down, what is the point of being special, if you're just going to die anyway moments later?<br /><br />I've told my friend that have read the first 2 books, to don't even think about reading book 3.<br /><br />And the movie?  what's the point now?
6305428042|5.0|I have holiday favorites for a variety of holidays.  Halloween is my favorite holiday.  The movie is funny and a little scary.  Bette Midler's role and her singing make for an enjoyable movie!
B004DTLK62|5.0|Outstanding biopic of the life of the amazing Charles Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr. nails &#34;the little tramp&#34; the same way George C. Scott nailed Patton. Other outstanding performances include Kevin Kline, Dan Aykroyd, Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane and Geraldine Chaplin (Chaplin's daughter) playing her own grandmother.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|IWhat else can I say other than I love this app! It Is always reliable and does its job very well! Thank you!
B005F9ZWKY|5.0|Excellent Film about what Nazi Germany was like. Better than Schindler's List. Polanski (director), Adrian Brody (male lead) and Ronald Harwood (screenplay) richly deserved the Oscars that they won for this film.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|All the episodes of one of the best series ever.  Peter Falk is wonderful to watch as Columbo.  I don't care as much for the later episodes, but that's true of many series.  Great writing, and engaging performances by Falk and most of the guest villains.
B00AOOIIVA|3.0|Frankenweenie is a black and white, cartoon version of Frankenstein done in Tim Burton/Danny Elfman style. If you know those two, you know what you are getting into. You have offbeat characters doing awkward things in emotionally touching ways. This is one of Burton's more &#34;normal&#34; films, maybe because it was created for kids. A four year old who watched it said it gave her nightmares, but a 9 year old said he loved the way that creatures were brought back to life- especially the big turtle. It has a few moments of humor where things go terribly wrong. The overall message is positive though. I'd watch it with the kids as the younger ones may have questions or may find a few things scary.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The concept and its functionality is excellent, but this device has no meaning at all if there's no integration with other apps. Video streaming it's way more than Youtube and Netflix... I'm starting to feel that Google's promises of more integration are not coming to reality!
B00CISAPJS|3.0|The adult male I watched this with said it was the worst movie he's ever seen. The child who watched it with us said it was too scary. With a starting point of a childhood story, a princess, CGI, and giants, you'd think it was a child's movie. All the fighting and violence says it's not. Now, Grimm and Anderson had their share of violence in their fairy tales. I think that's actually better than Barnie and pretending that the world is a safe place, but this was not the type of thing you want a child watching. It's not just \\"the wolf blew the house down.\\" It's bone crunching and catapulting  flaming trees.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought the acting and writing were good. The story follows most of the legend. It could have been better and ended up being just alright.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|The Best Yet!  listening to it nonstop...<br />A little bit darker, a bit melancholic, but a great rock album.<br />True to QOTSA, this album will NOT disappoint.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I found it relatively easy to ignore 5FDP at first, lumping them in with metalcore or other various acts long on noise and screeching and low on songwriting craft, but thanks to the inclusion of a \\"greatest hits\\" CD available to readers of Britain's Metal Hammer, I got to listen to them and found out they were a damn good band, mixing fury with melody and hooks galore.<br />  Image aside, while I grow tired of war themes, there is so much of it in metal you can't escape it, so in my case I pay more attention to the music.  And true to the ugly people make the best music principle, \\"The Way of the Fist\\" resonates with the power of early Pantera and incorporates clean and heartfelt vocals in the choruses, a lot of times with harmonies, which, by looking at a band photo you wouldn't expect.<br />  The most potent weapons, pun intended for these guys is vocalist Ivan Moody, expressive and actually talented, doing as much clean vocals as roaring.  Add to that a guitar section that is more precise and meat cleaver sharp than just about any band out there, including great lead work from Zoltan Bathory, and 5FDP have a sound that appeals to those hungry for power and anger but sick of noise and incompetent playing.<br />  They have a devoted following and are poised to be huge.  Keep up this level of musicianship, don't puss out like Metallica, and they may become one of modern metal's biggest acts soon, joining places with the mighty Mastodon and Lamb of God.  Fans of Suicidal Tendencies and Pantera need to check these guys out immediately if they haven't already.

B005ZOCF5E|4.0|Getting uphill when reading this book was rough at times. It had step slopes I had to stop and stare at. I was even amazed at was I was looking at but still wishing the ascent was a a tad smoother.  But on e I crossed the sun it if this book, the downhill journey was fast and fun.  Just remember to bring lot patience with you.

B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I like this 'alot' :) great read, very funny, great insight to how depression is, and really love all the dog stories!
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Not her best effort but an Ok album despite some dodgy lyrics. Standouts include Donatella, Artpop , Swine and Applause ,  the rest is pretty much filler. Like her previous albums the Madonna influence is unmistakable especially on tracks like Fashion, Applause and Donattella which are also the better tracks. Perhaps she should stick to that formula. She is still a work  in progress but continues to show promise.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Another thrilling page turner by  one of the best writers ever! It was fantastic to learn what life dealt little Danny Torence, the young boy in The Shining. If you,like many of us, consider The Shining one of the scariest tales ever told you are going to love Dr. Sleep
0385537131|2.0|Below par for Grisham. I consider myself a big Grisham fan.  I have read all of his books as soon as they are released and have enjoyed most of them.  I'd rate this as my least favorite.  I had my doubts about a sequel to A Time to Kill, but the strong published reviews convinced me to purchase it.  The story is flat throughout and there is no surprise ending... you can see the ending coming after the initial chapters. Mostly a retread of A Time to Kill  without the well developed plot and characters.  Definitely not worth the hardback price or the time it took to read.  There are too many other good books out there.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Of course all scary movies that include children are even creepier! Combine that with a doll that doesn't look like Chucky and a house with an attitude....

1476727651|5.0|I have been anticipating this book since it's announcement a couple years ago when it was left up for a vote between \\"Wind through the keyhole\\" or \\"Dr. Sleep\\". Well, my vote was for Dr. Sleep and Dr. Sleep won, but for some reason, Keyhole came out anyways.<br />Anyhow, once i dove into Dr. Sleep I was glued to the pages. I had missed Danny 'Doc' Torrence and wondered what ever happened to him. As a child he didn't have much of a chance to grow up without a few problems and having Mr. King give us a peek into Dan's life post-Overlook Hotel was a treat.<br />The book takes us on a tour of what happened with the remaining Torrences (Wendy and Danny) and even a visit from the Overlook's former chef with a \\"shine\\" Dick Holloran after the events of \\"the Shining\\". Danny is still haunted by the ghosts of the Overlook, who have followed him after the ominous hotel's demise. Danny's mom, Wendy, calls on Dick to help the boy once again. Fast forward to his current life. He has taken on his father Jack's legacy of alcoholism and violence. Drifting from job to job, bed to bed, town to town. Eventually he comes to a small New England town where he hits his rock bottom and tries to straighten out his life. He joins AA and becomes an employee of the local hospice house where he uses his \\"Shine\\" to help those across to the \\"clearing at the end of the path\\" gaining him the nick name \\"Dr. Sleep\\".<br />Meanwhile, a young girl with powers that dwarf what Dan Torrence had, is being targeted by a group of psychic \\"vampires\\" who disguise themselves as a group of retirees traveling across America in a caravan of RVs. She has the \\"steam\\" they need to stay alive, and with a telepathic cry for help, Dr. Sleep hears her call.<br />A wonderful story that puts Stephen King back in the forefront of horror fiction! Was a joy to read and was sad to reach the end.
0553381407|5.0|GREAT BOOK, FO RANYONE WHO HAS THIS ISSUE.. AND MANY PEOPLE DO..<br />IF YOU FEEL TO READ, TO LEARN, ETC.. THIS BOOK COMES AS A HIGH<br />RECOMMEND FROM ME..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever. Definitely recommend this book. Loved it! Very intense and captures readers from the beginning. Movies don't to it justice!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is an awesome movie! Love Jeremy Renner in it. Lots of action and keeps you on the edge...Watched more than once.
1400069289|4.0|The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg is an engaging read that examines the human machinery behind our habits. Underlying our actions are behavior patterns that have grown over time through the way our mind makes associations. In 1892, William James, the famous philosopher/ psychologist, said that our life is but a mass of habits. And in 21st Century, Mr. Duhigg, with in-depth illustrations and a simple model, teaches us how the habits function through cues, behavior patterns, and rewards.<br /><br />The book is both theoretical and practical. Mr. Duhigg covers the power of habits from many angles (ethics, influencing forces, learning, neurology, and business, etc.), and sharply concludes that we can change our habits. If you coach people, help lead change, or are trying hard to improve your own effectiveness, then I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />To be balanced, I think too much time is spent on looking at legal cases and ethical concerns. The core information may be gleaned early into the book. However, through the extensive and diverse examples, Mr. Duhigg reinforces the central message that our habits are indeed powerful, but can be shaped to achieve the rewards you truly want.
B00C5XBAOA|4.0|The Mattel set for Sofia contain all members of the family which is what I wanted for my niece who isn't as keen on the animals. The set when it arrived was a little bit off putting - they are bobble heads and I'm waiting for them to fall off. It's also quite hard to balance them and make them stand up.<br />However they are very like the characters in the show and my niece appears to love them so I had to give it 4 stars!
B007SGM084|5.0|I've read the series twice and each time I couldn't put it down.  All three books just keep you glued to the page.  I'm glad I bought the trilogy as a bundle because the first book doesn't end with a happily ever after and I immediately had to start on the second book.  If you are reading these books for the first time, bring some Kleenex and a fan because some parts will just break your heart and some parts are just HOT!!!
B002ZG9968|5.0|Adorable movie. I bought it after finding out I was having twins and that made it even more special to me.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|As I said in my title, it has GREAT graphics! That's why it is the 2014 version! In my opinion, it just gets harder when you have to kill more than one animal in mission, before they run away.
0316223239|4.0|The book is very depressing, but it is a new and unique perspective on a very diffiucult sitaution. We read it for book club and although I would not have picked this out to read on my own, I am glad I read it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I just really like this game. It is so fun. It is one of my favorite games to play. My kid loves it as well
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. Great  game to occupy your time. Don't like having to wait for more lives, but it gives me a chance to charge my Kindle. I highly recommend this yummy game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Ok so this one is so awesome. I love how you can combinethe different sounds to make your own relaxing melody.  Awesome!!!
1781162646|5.0|Some of my book club members are squeamish, so this title added a safe,Safe thrill ride flavor to an otherwise bland reading list. The length also helped encourage some of the busier members.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Learned more than I bargained for. This book is pro and aspiring photographers.  Thanks for sharing your experience. Well done
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Narrated by death himself,it gives a good view of the best and the worst of the human race in Nazi Germany.  Can't wait to see the movie!  I don't see how it can do the book justice.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I finished reading Doctor Sleep: A Novel by Stephen King. It's the best kind of sequel: it references, with holy integrity, the original while furthering the story. Not only do we learn what happened to little Danny when he grew up, we also gain some understanding of the macabre mystery haunting Overlook Hotel. So, if you enjoy scary yarns, pull on this one, and let the ghosties fly. Shine on!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed this book. I like the first one most of all. There were so many characters that it was hard to keep track. The ending was good. I think Peeta is the best match for Katniss because they are opposites.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Writing to say how much I enjoyed the audible version of this book. Four different speakers narrate the tale in excellent fashion. I have purchased several audible books now and just as a poor narrator can make a good book an unpleasant listen having good narrators can even seem to improve a mediocre book. Heard aloud the story was suspenseful and well done with realistic characters. A great listen.
B008C20TDG|5.0|You will never look at your favorite foods again, this doesn't just tell you it's bad but how it effect your body.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album lyrically pieced together. With that in mind, don't judge it by saying none of the songs sound the same.<br /><br />Aura: My personal favorite, this song is a cry for women of the Middle East who are wrongfully treated and looked down upon. She pronounces Aura as \\"awrah\\"(forgot how to spell it!) which means \\"naked\\" in some language I forgot. There is lots of clever wordplay and fantastic chorus.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Venus: She did lots of studying for this one! My only complaint is the repetitive \\"take me to your planet\\" part.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />G.U.Y: Don't have much insight on this one, but it rocks my socks.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Sexxx Dreams: Hot. Hot. Hot.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Jewels and Drugs: Not my cup of tea, but very innovative for gaga!<br /><br />6/10<br /><br />MANiCURE: Can never remember this song. Good, but I find it forgettable.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />Do What U Want: Very smooth, amazing vocals from the both of them. They worked so well together!<br /><br />9.5/10<br /><br />ARTPOP: Love song from ART to POP, and POP to ART. Gorgeous.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Swine: SWIII-II-II-II-IINE!<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Donatella: Can't really get into this song, but it's great, so I know others will!<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />Fashion!: I'm not a fan, but it SCREAMS Gaga.<br /><br />6/10<br /><br />Mary Jane Holland: I don't like this song. At all. The only song I deleted right away. It is pretty good EDM though...<br /><br />3/10 (my opinion!)<br /><br />Dope: About recovering from addiction. I cried. Freaking beautiful.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Gypsy: This one is destined to see TONS of radio plays.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Applause: Iconic<br /><br />9.5/10<br /><br />The album is mainly about money, sex, drugs, and fame, and I interpret it as a polished and better version of the Fame<br /><br />125/150 for me! I got almost the same percentage as billboard! I should work there...
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Once upon a time this Lady had as biography on her Twitter account \\"when POP suck the tits of ART\\" leading some questions if this was about her new record. Well, indeed it was!<br /><br />This album gets better with every listen, and I'm not saying this as a fan of hers, but also because it is a great departure from her previous effort (known as 'Born This Way'). This album starts where 'The Fame Monster' left, it feels like if The Fame Monster met Born This Way and they got to get along together and this album came as the result from their recording sessions.<br /><br />What I love about this album the most, is that you can tell how much effort she puts on the production, the lyrics, and her vocals. This woman takes you to another level when it comes to her music and art. Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite albums released this year and probably Gaga's best album to date.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Ive read King's books forever it seems. He never disappoints! The man is a genius! I couldnt put the book down once I read the first chapter. My Dad read it first. Hes 74.... He's also been a Stephen King fan forever too! Thanks Stephen King for all of your fascinating novels over the years...... Keep em coming! Youve got a fan for life!
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandson loves this. Great for the price. FREE! It can keep you occupied for hours, we love it. :)
B000XXLY8G|5.0|I love these boots. I got them for a lot cheaper than Macy's is selling them. They are very comfortable and look great with jeans. They do run big. I read reviews that said they run big and they weren't kidding. I wear a 13 in Nike and I ordered an 11.5 for these boots. They fit perfect. I recommend.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|The only sad part about this game was that there weren't more levels. It was a different type of logic puzzle.  Seriously can't wait for them to either add to it or come out with another one.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Good throwback movie for kids. Reminiscent of the Roger Rabbit era type movies.  I watched this movie with my 2 & 4 year old and they absolutely loved it. I haven't watched it since well before year 2000' but it still was enjoyable. My kids keep asking me to watch it again.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Why is it so hard to stop playing this game. Even on the hard levels. I play this more than any other game.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|So rather than tell you what songs I liked I think i'll just give a breakdown of what I hated about this album.<br /><br />First off I feel that unless you have 15 unique sounding tracks that fit together well, then and only then should you put out a 15 track album. Instead we have several songs on here that are so not Gaga and were basically similar or worse than others and could have been left off.<br />-G.U.Y along with sexxx dreams are well about sex. I felt that Sexxx dreams had a better bassline and overall sound.<br />-Jewels and Drugs features several southern rappers with gaga on the hook. Overall it doesn't showcase gaga as the centerpiece of the song.<br />-Manicure to me just sounded tacky.<br />-Donatella like Fashion! is well about Fashion...but the beat and gaga's repetitive choral shriek of &#34;Donatella&#34; sounded unpleasant to the ear<br /><br />and now onto the last three tracks all of which can stand on their own as album closers:<br />-Dope- is a melancholy piano pop song...which is pretty depressing and doesn't jive with the mood of the rest of the album<br />-Gypsy is beautifully produced packed with beats on top of guitar strumming and soaring vocals from Gaga<br />-Applause is well nothing special of a pop song. It's okay but little vocal ability demonstrated on it: mostly faux gloomy posturing the verses.<br /><br />I feel that this album would have been much tighter overall if she just cut these useless tracks and given us the 9 or 10 solid ones. It would have made for an easier listen because it would be just a few good bits to take in without dropping so much on us because let's face it: most of the tracks are pretty damn &#34;thumpa thumpa&#34; and 15 of them is A LOT to take it.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|Pretty good movie. I do think the story gets convoluted once it gets to the Sugar Rush stage of the movie. Vaneloppe is overly annoying IMHO. I like this movie more for all of the video game nostalgia than I do for the story itself which is kind of sad!
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|My 9 year old spent her birthday money on this and could not be happier! The detail is amazing and the wings that move were such a big selling point for her. She has a TON of Schleich animals and figures and none have ever disappointed. A few great highlights on this Dragon Rider the wings actually move, but you do need to be careful as they can pop out and are a little difficult to get back in, my 9 year old can get them back in but my 7 year old has a hard time. The rider is magnetic so he stays on when &#34;flying&#34; around and it is huge in compare to some of the other animals creatures that she has. She has played with it non stop and it has a nice resting area on her bed at night:) Overall highly recommended!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|this is a very well made app its beautiful and vivid....i love the puzzle facts that pop up while loading a puzzle....i enjoy this app so much it is infact relaxing!!!
B0072HXVRS|5.0|My 9 year old daughter has quite a collection of Schleich and Safari LTD animals and this fit in with all the rest. It gets played with quite a lot through out the week. The detail is amazing and my 7 year old really wants one know too. It has a different looking face(my opinion) but my daughter explained that is what makes it special, so for us it was a win. We haven't found any of there products not to be and we have quite a collection!
B0062OCNAI|4.0|Once I got past the &#34;walking around as spirits&#34; (which wasn't terribly hard) I liked the voice, liked the vocabulary, and liked the plot.  A tad predictable, but still some surprising twists.  Interesting to see that elementary school drama, especially amongst the adults, exists in English schools as well as American ones, but I did find the naivete of the main character to be harder to swallow than the &#34;walking around as spirits&#34;! I also loved the author's list of influential books/authors at the end of my Kindle version - I've gone on to read some of them and can see the influence.  All in all, a nice read, would pick something of Ms. Lupton's up again.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I rate this game 4 1/2 star is great, fast moving that captures your attention.  It's endless fun of trying to complete the Mahjong puzzles.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I worked so hard to beat metro then I finaly beat him now I got Camlot for a robot.The robots I are ambush blacktop and camlot
B005LAIIN0|5.0|It is a whole new concept for zombie movies. Great plot. Good ending to the movie. Not like every other zombie movie.
0525478817|5.0|book that affected me most and left me crying for hours BEAUTIFUL Augustus Waters &#60;3 will forever be in my heart
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|if you love Country you'll love these guys!!! Also, their songs of pure fun. Can't wait for their next CD!
B00AGP2XS6|5.0|Denzel is super good in this movie.  Kept me on the edge of my seat and ended with a message.
B00G32OER4|3.0|...and it does have some of the same ol' same ol'. Think Exorcist.<br /><br />And it is scary! Also, loved the feel of the period (seventies). You may find a few inconsistencies, but that just shows how long it's been. And how old some of us are.<br /><br />I've read reviews, not so much on Amazon but elsewhere, that this film contains religious propaganda. I don't want to write a spoiler here, so I won't say why, one way or the other. But just think about it. For instance, if you think a children's seance has something to do with religion, then you may think this movie does.<br /><br />Anyway, good Halloween movie, yes scary, don't expect more than that. Oh, except some good acting. Liked the house too!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT!!  I have loved this series and it's characters.  I couldn't wait for Allegiant to come out, but I was sorely disappointed.  The heroine of the story is killed near the end!  Yes, Tris dies!  What a stupid thing to do.  Like I said, so disappointed!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very exciting. Well made and full of challenges. I would recommend this game to my friends. Looking forward to playing all levels
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie captured the nostalgia inside all of us (and even meta-nostalgia!) for the ostensible allure of a different time and place. Peripherally, in a way, it also deals with historic characters of outsize proportions, and the quotidian aspects of managing a modern relationship. It gave me a new appreciation for the 1920s, Parisian charm, and the interesting people who called both the time and place home. Owen Wilson is great, as is the casting generally for the full scope of personalities brought to bear in the film.
1475143389|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as it made me see weightlifting in a whole new light. I'm about three weeks into the exercises that Mike goes over in the book and I'm loving them. I look forward to the gym everyday and can already see the results by following his meal plans as well as the exercises.<br />Great book!
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|The Extended Edition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is excellent! I absolutely enjoyed every minute of the film and the behind-the-scenes Appendices. The Appendices offer a great look into the creation of the film and the characters in it. There's over 9 hours of content in the Appendices, which makes the price for this edition worth it. The Amazon Exclusive statue of Bilbo and Gollum is very nice! The quality of the piece is great and it really looks good on a shelf. I highly recommend this product!
B002TWWOHE|5.0|While it is an interesting and visually stunning (both the main character and the city views) show, I must say the best part of the series is the sidekick Mossie...he is both quirky and caring and adds the light touch needed in this show of distrust and government agencies.
B008MM9630|5.0|I really like this game. it is fun. It gives you the opportunity to advance in fable kingdom as well.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|It's hard to like anyone in this show.  It makes you wonder if anyone in the world is ever honest with their loved ones and if they were what growth could be achieved.  Hated the cheating and the all-around selfishness.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A mystery easy to solve but hard to put down. Great characters, great read, great story, thoroughly enjoyed, you will love it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this. Stream your computer screen easily to your HDTV with an incredibly easy WiFi setup. Watch Netflix from your phone app on your TV. Stream YouTube videos easily from your Chrome browser to your TV. And all for $35.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and love that the kindle fire now has it. I play it all the time there is no glitches or let downs as far as I can tell.
B003G4W49C|3.0|This book is ok.  Some people love this book, I probably would like it more if I was an adolescent
B006Y9BVRM|3.0|Watch is fine, decent build quality and well proportioned.  It's a little lighter than I would have expected for its size/thickness.<br /><br />The feature I was most disappointed with was the strap - it tapers in width so it's pretty narrow round the wrist which, to me, makes it look more like a boys watch than a mans divers watch.  I'll be looking to replace the strap and I think that will improve the overall aesthetic significantly.  If it had a better strap I would have given four stars.<br /><br />It's a nice watch for day to say use, I bought it for use on holiday when I'm in and out the water all day but it looks fine to leave on for an evening.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Wasn't thrilled that Mark is gone. Was sad and fighting back tears the whole time. Glad to read Bridget again.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I really like this game.  Unfortunately  the 1st time I downloaded  it and had a quite large chunk of land and animals  my kindle started to freeze up.  Now after downloading it again I am reminded why I deleted  it th  1st time. The advertising seems to slow it down as  well a  the larger your property the more issues I seem to have with it. Will probably end up eventually deleting it again.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|I had to turn the movie off.  We got through main event but what the heck with the Full Frontal nudity, the porn scene shots, Denzel's full but crack...  I had to turn it off my 14 and 16 yr old daughters were completely uncomfortable seeing this.  Given the title and the summary.  I had no reason to expect this!!!!
B008J8KBKY|5.0|I think this is a really great connect 4 style game. Its good great 3d graphics and cool background music. Lots of fun and can play online.
B008JFUORW|1.0|This is just awful. My vocabulary doesn't have enough adjectatives to describe how bad a plot and action movie this is. This is coming from someone who enjoyed the first two.
B007SGM084|5.0|I've loved reading the trilogy. Leaves me wanting more. Amazing work for EL James! More then recommended! Everyone will fall in love with 50!
B008J8KBKY|4.0|This is a pretty cool game. Comment four is a good game, but this is better! The problem is that there are so many places to place a point, so it's kind of hard to see all of the points since the places sometimes overlap. Overall, it has cool animation, and you can make an account to save your progress just in case something hall happens to your device, or, you can play as a guest.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished it in an day. In a day. Ignore ignore the talks to see it was dangerous white men and
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Hands down one the best albums of 2013 and definitely one of the most anticipated of the past two years. A must have for pop and lady gaga fans.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I actually enjoyed playing on Facebook, but hated having to regenerate energy and it taking all long. Now I can just do the quests and enjoy the game without energy getting in the way.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is awesome I can't stop playing this game I wish there was an update like the old server for Kindle version.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book goes beyond my words. Nothing I write, type or think in comparison of this book will be enough for it. I am many of those who cried. I mean bawled like a baby. (MINISPOILER ALERT) After he said I lit up like a Christmas tree you already knew.<br /><br />I am only 14 so some of this book took time to comprehend though I may say I read it in one day. I felt like they weren't present  today teenagers. I will not complain about that because  it made it far more interesting and it made them different and special. I also spent time preparing my self for the sadness of so I thought what would come of it. But I did not. It made me see things in a new perspective, made me think outside the box. I was touched, not just emotional but intellectually. John green is genius and if you disagree, so be it, lol. I would recommend this book to any of my friends or family members because  it deserves that much.<br /><br />So thank you to other reviews that convinced me to get this book and to the phenomenal characters who I will never forget. Beautiful Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. And last but not least just how she was eager to find out the ending of Anna's story, I want to know hers. I will not have closure until so. Okay I'm not done. Last thing I promise, I wish it would have had both POV's.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I freaking live this game it is so fun and addicting once I started I couldn't stop I would suggest getting this game
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Really good game. Been playing for like half an hour but better then Deer Hunt Reloaded. Definitely should add this game!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is good until you reach the later levels. Then you can't win until you purchase extra items, and that adds up.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|Has most of the songs from the movie, except Anna Kendrick's Cup Song.  If it had that song too, I'd give all 5 stars.  Was disappointed that song wasn't on it.
B009Z5975A|3.0|This is a good price for three classic movies in Blu-Ray, but be warned: the entire beginning sequence from Gremlins where the Dad buys Gizmo from the old man's shop in Chinatown is completely missing.  Luckily we had a DVD copy so we could go back and watch the opening sequence, because my daughter was seeing it for the first time and that first part sets up the rest of the movie and the Dad's parting comments at the end of the movie make a lot less sense.  Haven't watched either of the other two yet, so I can't comment on those. I'll write an update after we watch the other two.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|There's a little bit of something for everyone.  From the retro-disco of &#34;Treasure&#34;, to love ballads, and rock songs.  Very enjoyable.
B004I8WD7S|1.0|Another AmazonBasics iPhone case that isn't great. It has a lot of bend to it, a glossy plastic feel to it. You'd be better with another type of case for slightly more money.
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|Dark and brooding, this is a thinking man's (or woman's) vampire flick, so this is not for the action craving, or sparkles in the sunlight crowd.  It has a somewhat unique vampire methos which was refreshing.  Well acted with a story that really came together nicely.  I was very happy to have seen this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is one of Grisham's best--can't put it down.  I love legal books, and I always learn so much from John Grisham's  books.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|Well written and an incredible telling of a life of experiences that are unbelievable...and yet totally true. I hope Mrs. beer is at peace now.  I thank her for telling her story.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great very good game, actually good for a free game love it, picture quality is good, didn't take much to fall in love with it
B003B02O0A|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is an action packed nail biter from beginning to end. A must read!
B0036S4B6M|2.0|After watching Season 1 of Orange Is The New Black and enjoying it, I am extremely disappointed by this book. It's very rare that a TV show or movie is better than a book, but this is one of those cases. Everything that makes the TV show good is missing from the book. In the memoir, Kerman has a bad habit of explaining rather than showing when it's something important: She pontificates generally about the sad state of the criminal justice system, but she doesn't give other prisoners' vignettes the way they do in the TV show. The result is that all the characters come off as less interesting and the story is less compelling. Interestingly, Kerman does expend the effort to show rather than explain when it's a matter that is relatively unimportant to the story: She spends pages and pages describing foods she ate or how they went about decorating the jail for various holidays. These details don't drive a story.<br /><br />Also, there's so much in the TV show that is missing from the book, but not much in the book that's not in the TV show. After going to jail, Kerman's lesbian codefendant doesn't reappear until 90% into the book, and the real story isn't nearly as interesting as the TV show. If you, like me, are buying this book because you enjoyed the TV show, be warned that they are very different and that the book is much less interesting.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A real page turner, I could not put it down. This will not be my last Lee Child book. I can't wait to buy the next one.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I saw the TV miniseries a few years back, and I always wanted to read the book. I'm glad I did. This was a great book with a very interesting take on the King Arthur story. The mix of legend, religion, and the evolution of society was very well done and thought provoking.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This is a solid album of pop gems.  Lady gaga melds the accessibility of her Fame era with the electronics of the Born This Way era to give us this superb collection of \\"ArtPop.\\"<br /><br />DJ White Shadow produced half of Artpop.  I personally would like Gaga to try out new producers when she starts work on her next album.  Here and DJWS have worked together awhile now.  Half of their effort I love and the other half I could easily do without. The following tracks are DJWS productions IN ORDER of most favorite to least favorite:<br />\\"Applause\\" - love this track.  It's a crime it didnt go to number one but still may have a chance since, as we speak, its moving up to #4 on pop airplay charts.<br />\\"Do What U Want\\" (featuring R. Kelly) - super sleek and sexy with an 80's vibe.  Hands down this one is an album gem.  While it was originally intended as a promo single, the fact that it went to #1 in over 71 countries, was proof enough that this could potentially be a major hit for Gaga, and is now the official second single for Artpop.<br />\\"Sexxx Dreams\\" - Super sleek production and a major contender for a single - my only concern is the song name might be deemed to controversial so they may change it to the name that appears on the clean version of the album, X Dreams.<br />\\"Artpop\\" - This track could have easily been on the Born This Way album.  Electronic pop opera is what comes to mind when I hear this.  The clean electro production and the sexy vocals from Gaga are pure magic.<br />\\"ManIcure\\" - Super cathcy anthem with a chorus that seeps into your brain and won't stop.<br />\\"Swine\\" - This track may not be as accessible as others on the album but like every track on the album has a sense of melody, some stronger than others but all have a common pop theme.  This is probably the most edm, club heavy track.<br />\\"Jewels n' Drugs\\" (featuring T.I., Too Short and Twista) - Though this is my least favorite song on the album it is still quite catchy and works with todays trap sound.  I think if this track and one or two others were left off, this would have been a perfect album.<br /><br />The remaining half of the album includes production from french house producers Zedd and David Guetta along with Leqlercq and will.i.am:<br /><br />1. Fashion! - This funky track sounds like a merging of Daft Punk's Get Lucky, Madonna's Holiday, and David Bowie's Let's Dance and just makes me want to move.  This is a David Guetta/will.i.am production and for the most part is pop perfection.  The problem for me is the last 40 seconds kind of get too hectic and kill the groove.  Nonetheless, I absolutely love this track.<br />2. Donatella - This beat is so fierce and strong with a diva-esque fashiony comedic alter ego with comicy lyrics to go along with what is a surefire club banger. This Zedd production needs to be released asap!<br />3. Gypsy - Produced by Leclercq, this is the \\"Edge of Glory\\" on this album and should be the next single.<br />4. G.U.Y. - Guy Under You is another excellent Zedd production with a great beat to dance to.<br />5. Dope - This is the only ballad on this album and is just stunning.  Based on the strength of the other songs on this album I am not sure I support this one being a single but based on indicators when it was released as a promo, it may do well.<br />6. Aura - Strong fresh electronic opener.  There's a demo floating around that some gaga fans prefer over the final released version.  It may be worth searching the web to hear what you think.<br />7. Venus - While I love the beat of this track, I am just not a fan of the lyrics.<br />8. Mary Jane Holland - is one of the very few track on the album which I skip.<br /><br />Long story short, Lady Gaga has put out an album of 15 tracks with minimal fillers and a strong number of potential number one singles.  If you want a fantastic electronic album to dance to, this is the one.  She exudes confidence, pokes fun at herself and pop culture while infusing today's electro edm beats as her back-drop.ctro edm beats as her back-drop.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Love the innovation of the series.  It is definitely entertaining. Nathan Fillion's tattoo was intriguing.  The emotional inter plays make it a very humorous show.
B00G32PQNA|2.0|The other movies in this series were well done with interesting characters and delightful scenery. This movie was about two self-indulgent characters who did nothing but argue. It was reminiscent of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf without the cast and good dialogue. In short, this is a boring waste of time and money.

B008QTV3X0|2.0|A waste of money.  Not that interesting or believable.  His rank on his uniform keeps changing (SGT, SSG, SFC) and the story plays like a mystery novel written by a middle school student.  Just a few reasons why I will not be purchasing or watching anymore of this series.

It fitted perfectly.<br /><br />It feels comfortable on my feet and it is stylish.<br /><br />The main reason I've bought these boots is that they are waterproof.

B00BATG18K|1.0|A rambling bumbling disappointment?  Graphic sexual situations unnecessary. . Too long.  Violet lacked any depth or insight.  Too much a victim to be believed.  NOT up to Amy Tan's ability.  Base unnecessary details. Not of previous calibre.  Harlequin romance with poor attempts at shades of grey.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Sebastian St.Vincent is a self-centered rake. He was rendered speechless when a woman he hardly knew (shy Miss Stuttering Evangeline Jenner) showed up at his home, proposing marriage. After Sebastian’s initial shock over his uninvited guest, he thought nothing of being rude and insulting to the stuttering Miss Evangeline.<br /><br />When Sebastian’s rude remarks didn’t produce their usual cowering effect, he stopped and began to listen to her instead. He listened intently to Evangeline’s stammering words, concentrating his focus on untangling and extracting the true reasons for her asking him to marry her. After only a few minutes of listening, Sebastian found himself seriously considering her marriage proposal.<br /><br />The fact of the matter was Sebastian needed Evangeline’s money, and Evangeline needed to be free from her relatives. When Evangeline’s mother died, her father asked his deceased wife’s family to take Evangeline in and raise her. Her father was the owner of a gaming club, and he felt that exposing a child, especially a young girl, to that type of atmosphere would do her harm. So he let her go. Now he  was dying and those same relatives, whom he had trusted, were not even allowing his precious Evie to visit him.<br /><br />Sebastian cared only about himself and getting his hands on Evangeline’s money. She only cared about escaping her abusive family. Evangeline made it very clear to Sebastian that she would only sleep with him once to consummate the marriage, and after that he would be free to live anywhere and anyway he chose. That sounded fantastic to Sebastian, so the two of them planned the details of their so-called “marriage” together.<br /><br />Sebastian smiled at the thought of  Evangeline Jenner. She was not the weak-willed person everyone thought she was. She was as strong-willed as he was, and she would soon show her father that his timid little Evie was a worthy opponent against their cruel relatives. Sebastian wondered just  how it was that he never noticed how pretty Evangeline was. He must be slipping he thought as he packed his getaway bag.<br /><br />Sebastian was a man who rarely thought beyond his own selfish needs, but that was about to change. He would soon find out that he would rather jump in front of a bullet to save his wife than to live without her. And as hard as she tried not to develop feelings for Sebastian, Evangeline would find herself falling hopelessly in love with the notorious rake.<br /><br />This is the third book in Lisa Kleypas’s Wallflower series, but it can be read easily as a stand-alone book. I found The Devil In Winter to be well-written and the storyline intriguing. Even the selfish rake Sebastian grew on me. There were parts, however, that were predictable and a little unrealistic, but that didn’t make the book any less enjoyable. The Devil In Winter  is a story that the reader will quickly lose themselves in. I highly recommend giving it a read.that he never noticed how pretty Evangeline was.

1611761824|4.0|When we last saw Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he was flying through the sky in a glass elevator along with his family and Willy Wonka himself.  Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator picks up right where we left off.  Charlie and his group fly higher and higher and higher until they actually leave the Earth's atmosphere and find themselves in outer space.<br /><br />But this is just the beginning.  Charlie and his crew are on the verge of the most fantastic voyage of their lives.  Before returning to Earth and the chocolate factory, Charlie and friends will nearly start an international incident, visit the famous Space Hotel USA, battle a horde of slimy squishy alien monsters, and rescue some stranded astronauts.  And that's just for starters!  There's still the chocolate factory back on Earth, the same chocolate factory that now belongs to Charlie.  Once we arrive back there with Charlie and Company there are even more splendors to behold.  If you thought we saw everything the chocolate factory had to offer in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you've got a big chocolate treat in store!<br /><br />Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is just more fun than I can tell you.  Roald Dahl's imagination knows no bounds.  There were passages in this book that actually had me laughing out loud, like this one for instance from Chapter 2:<br /><br />'Hello, Houston!' he cried into the mike. 'There's something crazy going on up here! There's a thing orbiting ahead of us and it's not like any space-ship I've ever seen, that's for sure!'<br />'Describe it at once,' ordered Ground Control in Houston.<br />'It's . . . it's all made of glass and it's kind of square and it's got lots of people inside it! They're all floating about like fish in a tank!'<br />'How many astronauts on board?'<br />'None,' said Shuckworth. 'They can't possibly be astronauts.'<br />'What makes you say that?'<br />'Because at least three of them are in nightshirts!'<br />'Don't be a fool, Shuckworth!' snapped Ground Control. 'Pull yourself together, man! This is serious!'<br />'I swear it!' cried poor Shuckworth. 'There's three of them in nightshirts! Two old women and one old man! I can see them clearly! I can even see their faces! Jeepers, they're older than Moses! They're about<br />ninety years old!'<br />'You've gone mad, Shuckworth!' shouted Ground Control. 'You're fired! Give me Shanks!'<br />'Shanks speaking,' said Shanks. 'Now listen here, Houston. There's these three old birds in nightshirts floating around in this crazy glass box and there's a funny little guy with a pointed beard wearing a black<br />top-hat and a plum-coloured velvet tail-coat and bottle-green trousers . . .'<br />'Stop!' screamed Ground Control.<br />'That's not all,' said Shanks. 'There's also a little boy about ten years old . . .'<br />'That's no boy, you idiot!' shouted Ground Control. 'That's an astronaut in disguise! It's a midget astronaut dressed up as a little boy! Those old people are astronauts too! They're all in disguise!'<br />'But who are they?' cried Shanks.<br />'How the heck would I know?' said Ground Control. 'Are they heading for our Space Hotel?'<br />'That's exactly where they are heading!' cried Shanks. 'I can see the Space Hotel now about a mile ahead.'<br />'They're going to blow it up!' yelled Ground Control. 'This is desperate! This is . . .' Suddenly his voice was cut off and Shanks heard another quite different voice in his earphones. It was deep and rasping.<br />'I'll take charge of this,' said the deep rasping voice. 'Are you there, Shanks?'<br />'Of course I'm here,' said Shanks. 'But how dare you butt in. Keep your big nose out of this. Who are you anyway?'<br />'This is the President of the United States,' said the voice.<br />'And this is the Wizard of Oz,' said Shanks. 'Who are you kidding?'<br />'Cut the piffle, Shanks,' snapped the President. 'This is a national emergency!'<br />'Good grief!' said Shanks, turning to Shuckworth and Showler. 'It really is the President. It's President Gilligrass himself . . . Well, hello there, Mr President, sir. How are you today?'<br />'How many people are there in that glass capsule?' rasped the President.<br />'Eight,' said Shanks. 'All floating.'<br />'Floating?<br />'We're outside the pull of gravity up here, Mr President. Everything floats. We'd be floating ourselves if we weren't strapped down. Didn't you know that?'<br />'Of course I knew it,' said the President. 'What else can you tell me about that glass capsule?'<br />'There's a bed in it,' said Shanks. 'A big double bed and that's floating too.'<br />'A bed!' barked the President. 'Whoever heard of a bed in a spacecraft!'<br />'I swear it's a bed,' said Shanks.<br />'You must be loopy, Shanks,' declared the President. 'You're dotty as a doughnut! Let me talk to Showler!'<br />'Showler here, Mr President,' said Showler, taking the mike from Shanks. 'It is a great honour to talk to you, Mr President, sir.'<br />'Oh, shut up!' said the President. 'Just tell me what you see.'<br />'It's a bed all right, Mr President. I can see it through my telescope. It's got sheets and blankets and a mattress . . .'<br />'That's not a bed, you drivelling thickwit!' yelled the President. 'Can't you understand it's a trick! It's a bomb. It's a bomb disguised as a bed! They're going to blow up our magnificent Space Hotel!'<br /><br />As I was reading the text of that passage I realized that at least part of the reason it was so funny was because of the way Douglas Hodge narrated it.  He reads with a great deal of enthusiasm and uses funny voices for the characters.  I think this is something that listeners of all ages can enjoy.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read the first 2 books multiple times and was very excited for the third book. I read Divergent and Insurgent both in less than 2 days each. This book I had to force myself to read it over several weeks, and with this book 1 time was plenty, I have no desire to ever read this book again. This book tarnished the first 2 books too, and I loved them both.<br /><br />The entire story line is ridiculous, there are all these new characters, really no development of the existing characters. There are new serums introduced in this book. The entire storyline is stupid, there was so much that could have been done once the characters got outside the fence but instead we got the dumbest storyline. The book is written from both Tris and Tobias' perspectives, which was confusing and the first 2 books were from Tris' perspective so it baffled me why this book needed to be from Tobias' perspective too, toward the end it made sense but I just hated it, plus once the main character is killed off why keep dragging the story out, she's dead what more is there to drag out for 10 more chapters? Plus I hated the chapters that were like a couple paragraphs long... why bother?<br /><br />I hated the end of the book, killing off 2 of the best characters and turning the other main character into a marshmallow, a sniffling cry-baby with mommy and daddy issues. Horrible. I felt like Veronica Roth wrote this one out of contractual obligations, this book had no passion or thought put in it at all.<br /><br />I wish memory serum really existed, I would drink it to erase this \\"book\\" from my memory.  I feel like the story I loved was spoiled with this third book. Too bad there isn't a 0 stars rating, even 1 star is too many for this book.
B00E7SXRHY|3.0|chose this rating because I don't see much sense on re-release an album that originally was stunning on vinyl in 1993, and then remastered and released on vinyl in 2009 with quite acceptable results.<br />A nice detail for this 2013 remastered version: the album is on 45 RPM. So you will note an improve when playing this awesome album.<br /><br />The 3rd record is what makes this edition worth, Side E contains the eastern egg from In Utero: &#34;Gallons of rubbing alcohol...&#34;. &#34;Marigold&#34; (outstanding sound!) , &#34;Moist vagina&#34; and &#34;Sappy&#34;  (both are 2013 mix) .<br />Side F contains &#34; I hate myself and want to die &#34; (2013 mix), &#34;Pennyroyal tea&#34; (Scott Litt mix)  and &#34;Heart shaped box&#34; and &#34;All apologies&#34; (Steve Albini mix) . I'll never know why these tracks were remixed by Scott Litt, the whole work by Albini was accurate and concise.<br />Notes:<br />- I did not feel satisfied with the 2013 mixes marked on the 3rd record.<br />-It would have been amazing the release of &#34;Live & Loud&#34; on vinyl.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Wow I was actually crying towards the end what an amazing story. I absolutely love this series and really wish it hadn't ended, but I have to say it ended well. :)
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|Fast paced...interesting characters....and you want to turn the page. These are my requirements for a good book..and it does that nicely!
B00F1W1S1M|2.0|I love many of Dream Theater's live albums/DVDs. Live Scenes from a Memory is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately, this performance (or combination thereof) pales in comparison to past efforts. The album starts out with my favourite song off of A Dramatic Turn of Events: Bridges in the Sky. The first thing I notice, 2:20 in, is that Jordan's grinding Hammond riff is nearly mixed out. This is unfortunate, as Jordan may well be the most talented member of the band, and he's certainly my favorite. Instead, all we get is John's guitar and Mike's drums. That's a running theme throughout the album: Jordan was nearly mixed out. James' vocals are not mixed out. This is also unfortunate, as his voice was pretty awful during these shows.<br /><br />For Dream Theater fans wanting a great live experience, there are better options. Pick them up instead.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|My friend had this on his Kindle and it took up so much memory that he had to delete a bunch of other apps to make it work. We played it for about 5 minutes and then it froze up...not once but twice. It made his Kindle so slow and sluggish that he finally took it off his Kindle and then everything went back to normal...So why isn't my friend writing this review?...He doesn't like writing bad reviews but I think they are important so that other people don't have to go through the same aggravation . Oh and by the way...this game is also one GIANT money pit.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent but this last book was really lacking in my opinion. I did not like it from the beginning. I wish I would have stopped at the second book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app its so much more easy than getting on Google.:-)<br />And I'm about to get the update I wonder what it will add. :-)
B00C7607BC|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and in great quality. It was also great to see the movie on-line so quickly after Disney began offering it in Blu-Ray/DVD edition. Thank you!
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|This game is very challenging! Like that the game is full screen on the kindle. Easier to spot items than most android versions I have  played. Has a unique twist with 3 different gaming genres like words, shapes or even hangman. One thing I wished it were a bit more bright and colorful but then again it is a Halloween theme lol...I would recommend this game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very powerful, human story. This is the first story I can recall written from inside the Nazi regime, though it's not about Nazi's exactly. Sadly, I have never considered how many Germans truly hated Hitler and his infiltration into everything. I'm excited to see how the movies interpret the narrator.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Gotta have my Crush!! Thank you amazon for finally offering us Kindle Fire users this game. I am an avid or should I say addicted fan of this on Facebook. Now I can play on the go anywhere anytime ALL the time lol...If you play on FB you will love to ad this to your kindle or android collection!! Hope you are planning to add other King games like Papa Pear, Farm Heroes, etc...all the FB favorites!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I am completely obsessed with this book! It is amazing just like all of the others! It wasn't my favorite but it was still amazing!
B0073COMUW|5.0|Great incandescent bulb replacement at a very affordable price! It is pure white (I prefer white over yellow light), and it does not get hot , so my room stays chill.<br />Hope it lasts for 10 years as the manufacturer states.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It is a novel full of suspense, intrigue, interesing, difficult to stop reading once you have begun. Many human emotions are involved. You never would think what the outcome of the book is. Definitely, I loved it.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is great, with many unlockables and hours.worth of gameplay. The only thing that could improve this game more would be an.endless mode, otherwise this is a must have.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Most addictive game ever my gosh I play it all the time.I give it a double thumbs up<br />That is a funny reply to this entry was posted on your own project management
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|I love LOVE Lady Gaga, but on this album, I feel that the magic that has made the outrageous lyrics and beats, lack the relateable and cool factor.<br /><br />I will be buying the Gypsy single, but as the CD as a whole doesn't speak to me.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I needed to watch it for Halloween. I succeeded in doing just that.<br />It was ridiculously awesome. I recommend it.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|A tad predictable, but entertaining.  Brad Pitt saves the world from Zombies.  There were startling moments where you expected them, and overall, the film was entertaining.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Fun and easy.  Its is a great relaxing game and fun to play.  A game you must keep your eyes on.
B00CE2G3AS|4.0|Some parts are pretty bad. I bought this after seeing the Musical was coming to Indy. I very vaguely remember this 1983 movie - mostly for the music and when Jennifer Beals removed her bra under her sweatshirt while the guy watched fish eyed.<br /><br />The musical play was better because it moved the story along better and in a 'cleaner' fashion. I really enjoyed seeing it so I looked the movie up on Amazon and bought the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The music is just tremendous. Acting ranges from bad to pretty good. Cinematography was interesting - especially the use of light and dark.<br /><br />The Blu-ray picture was top notch as was the music and sound in general.<br /><br />I would rate this a 7.5 to 8.0 out of 10 stars - recommended for 1980's music lovers and anyone who like a good but not great movie.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Vintage Rebus: vintage Rankin!  A world without Rebus is dull indeed!  Welcome back!  Ian's in his heaven;so am I!  Great!
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|Never thought I'd find another artist who's music would move me the way Sigur R&oacute;s does, but this artist and this album (as well as The Wild Youth)comes in a close second.<br /><br />This is definitely worth giving a try.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|AM is Arctic Monkeys best album so far. They depart from their punkish roots and head straight for modern rock. The bass lines are the biggest change and thats a good thing. You will be able to listen to this album over and over and over and over and it will never get boring.
055358202X|3.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is meant to be taken as a seven-part story, I think, though the 6th and 7th parts have yet to be written.  Though written independently, it wouldn't make much sense to just pick up A Feast for Crows and read it, without having read A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords.  That being said, I'm having a difficult time with this one.  GRRM admits that this book was a bitch to write; for me, it's a bitch to read.<br /><br />In the first three parts, I couldn't wait to get to the next page.  I'm not feeling that with this one.  Maybe the story has just taken too long to unfold; I don't know.  But, while reading it, I find myself drifting off and wondering to myself, \\"What should I have for dinner tonight.\\"  Put another way, I just don't care about the characters.  Even when I get to an Arya chapter, I'm less excited than I used to be.  When I finished A Storm of Swords, I was eager to start on AFFC, but he didn't really pick up where he'd left off, at least not with all the characters.  I won't write in any spoilers here, but some characters are teased on in the final bit of ASOS, and then ignored almost entirely in this one.<br /><br />GRRM makes a big deal of mentioning his motives for writing stories that aren't predictable, and then sets about as if to break the world's record for unpredictability.  It just seems to me that trying so hard to be unpredictable for the sake of originality is not a worthy goal.  We all love being surprised, but enough already.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this series and will continue to read it, because I want the entire story.  It seems that two more books are due (after ADWD) and so I'll hang in there and hope A Dance with Dragons is a more entertaining read.  My hope is that the popularity and style of the television show will not spoil his books to come, or influence his writing in a way that cheapens it.
B00FGM0IEU|3.0|I swear that there must be some rule that any music documentary MUST include Bono as a talking head whether or not it has anything to do with him or U2. Why, with all the great material produced out of Muscle Shoals, all the important musicians and great songs recorded there, does this movie have to start with Bono blathering on about some mystic BS before it really starts in with a Wilson Pickett song? Why not just start with the Wilson Pickett?<br /><br />Despite the obligatory Bono exposition every ten minutes or so, there are some great stories told that make this worth watching.<br /><br />But just as it starts weakly, and inexplicably, with Bono being Bono, with all those great songs from the \\"Muscle Shoals catalog,\\" it ends with some awful over-emotive number by Alicia Keys.

1451620829|5.0|I have not recently enjoyed a book by a rock icon as much as this one, perhaps because it was told by the Catman, himself.  \\"Makeup to Breakup\\" is an excellent chronological narration by Peter Criss about his entire life: growing up on the streets of Brooklyn, playing the local bars, achieving superstardom in KISS,  post-KISS life.....to present day.<br /><br />One of the main things that appealed to me about the style of this book is that the author made me feel as though I was sitting down, having a few beers with him while he told this story. Another is that Peter is a local guy from Brooklyn who, along with the other members of KISS, had an astounding impact on rock in the 70s. When I was growing up, there wasn't one teen I knew that didn't idolize the band members in KISS. While they weren't the greatest of musicians, KISS brought an excitement to the stage of rock 'n roll that no other band did, at the time. In fact, I recall from having seen them at Madison Square Garden, exactly what Peter said about the early days of KISS:  the band was so loud that it was probably 20 seconds into every song before I knew which one was playing. My ears were ringing for the next day after that....<br /><br />Another reason that I liked this book so much is that at least Peter came clean about his years as an alcoholic/drug addict.  He didn't try to hide behind anything or lie about it....He admitted it and saw it as a problem. Now, as many that have seen Peter as a \\"megalomaniac\\", I just didn't see the same thing and maybe because I am being impartial as a reviewer. I have not been a KISS fan since my youth, but I can still acknowledge that Mr. Criss has crafted a well-written, candid account of his life and it was well-worth reading. In fact, Peter is a very funny author and numerous times, I found myself laughing out loud at his dialogue, his depiction of the KISS life backstage and stories of other KISS band members. In addition, I acknowledge the  innovation, theatrics and stage presence that KISS brought to the world of rock.<br /><br />I had read one of Gene Simmons' books several years back and I liked it, but not as much as this. Yes, it's clear that Gene is a highly talented, creative businessman that had dynamic visions of stardom from the start. One thing that definitely parallels between Gene/Peter's books is that Gene and Paul always controlled KISS and Ace and Peter were made less significant. As Gene mentions, Ace and Peter never really held jobs in the early days of KISS (nor were they sober enough) and it was left up Gene/Paul to provide the finances. In addition, it was really Gene and Paul's band, anyway, since Peter and Ace later answered the ads placed, seeking musicians. Almost from the start, Peter was doomed to get a lesser share, percentage-wise, from that point forward.  It would never be his band, equally.<br /><br />There is a very good insight into the KISS animosity towards each other that Peter sheds a light on in this book.  I would tend to lean towards Peter's account of being mistreated or not treated as an equal......and that Gene and Paul were not the easiest to get along with. In fact, I would tend to see Gene and Paul as being on the arrogant side of things when it comes to many things:  I heard an interview with Gene in which he bashed Peter's drumming in the early days.  Frankly, Gene was not the best bass player or musician either, so he had nerve to criticize someone else.<br /><br />If you're looking for a very good book, written by a down-to-earth rock legend, this is it.nd stage presence that KISS brought to the world of rock.<br /><br />I had read one of Gene Simmons' books several years back and I liked it, but not as much as this.

B0015DROBO|5.0|But only if you love sandwiches, economics, and don't have a strong gag reflex. I'm a big fan of Icelandic pi books, and love me some Erlander, but you'll need some serious love of nonfiction and a willingness to disregard nasty stuff too get through this. It's totally worth it. If Chandler had been Swedish and internet savvy, his name would be Stieg Larsson. Rock on, Stieg.
0486414124|3.0|This review is for the Dover Thrift Edition, I love Dover and how cheap they make reading the classics.<br />Having read a couple of Jane Austen's other novels I would have to say that this one suffers by comparison, it lacks the polished wit of her later work. Having said that it is still a pleasure to read and anyone who enjoys classics or even just English fiction in general will like  this novel.<br />I  think it's worth pointing out what to expect with Jane Austen if you haven't read her before. She doesn't write about social or political issues the way Dickens or Gaskell did. Her novels are fundamentally light and focused on human manners and emotions rather than any big issues. A good book for lovers of the classics to lose themselves in.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|It's not a surprise to see many mixed reviews about this album. Gaga is the biggest pop star out there and that comes along with many haters as well as those who can't accept anything new and different from her and are stuck and will always be stuck on The Fame era...<br />Personally, I really love the ENERGY this album has. Like she once said \\"it's like drinking 10 cups of coffee at once\\". I agree. What really made me fall in love with this cd is that behind all that energy,tech sound lies a very personal, honest and touching Gaga. PERFECT COMBINATION!<br />Favorite songs: Venus, Gypsy, Aura, Artpop and of course....who doesn't LOVE Applause!<br />WELL DONE!

B00H83EUQW|5.0|This is an AMAZING film, which I enjoyed greatly! This review includes very LIMITED SPOILERS.<br /><br />At 90 minutes this space drama is a rather short film - but it packs much more tension, drama, scares and adventures than many two hours and a half action films. Only two actors really appear in it - three other people show themselves extremely briefly and elusively and there are also some voices on the radio and that is all. But those two actors are in fact exactly as much as this film needs and limiting the numbers was an excellent idea!<br /><br />Almost all action takes place in space and a great effort was made to give this film a feeling of reality - especially the absence of sound in space is strictly respected, with muffled noises being heard only when one of the heroes hold some metal and hits other metal with it (metal, unlike void, conducts sound, even in space). One could think that it will hurt the film - but one would be VERY WRONG! It is actually exactly the contrary!<br /><br />The rhytm of the film is very fast - an emergency occurs very early in the beginning and then all hell breaks loose and it continues until the incredibly dramatic, grandiose finale, with only brief pauses to catch breath. In the cinema where I saw this film, most people abandoned all attempts to munch after five minutes - me included. And I really like my popcorn...<br /><br />This is NOT a sci-fi movie! The technology shown in this film really exists and purely in theory such a thing could really happen. Fiction elements were added by keeping the US space shuttle in service (they are all retired now) and by giving it a fictitious name, &#34;Explorer&#34;. Real life space shuttles were named respectively &#34;Enterprise&#34; (the prototype, not capable of space flight), &#34;Columbia&#34;, &#34;Challenger&#34;, &#34;Discovery&#34;, &#34;Atlantis&#34; and &#34;Endeavour&#34; - there never was a shuttle named &#34;Explorer&#34;, but the name sounds like one a real shuttle could bear. Another fiction element is the presence of the Chinese space station &#34;Tiangong&#34;, which is already fully operational, when in real life its construction should start only in 2020. BUT, the technology seen in this film is all there and there is no aliens, there is no mysterious forces, etc. - of course it is an adventure made in Hollywood, but in its nuts and bolts this movie is very realistic.<br /><br />Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are excellent in this film. In fact I believe Ms Bullock deserves at least an Oscar nomination for this role. Clooney's character offers him a little less oportunities to shine, but he does it nevertheless!<br /><br />I usually do not like 3D AT ALL, but in this film it actually adds a LOT! I advise strongly to go see this film on a big screen AND IN 3D, as long as it still plays in theatres! I will probably buy the Blu-ray version as soon as it is available, because here very pixel counts, but still, on a smaller screen and without a good 3D &#34;Gravity&#34; will lose part of its firepower.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is an AMAZING, GREAT film which I loved in cinema and I absolutely want to re-watch it again. And again. Enjoy!ld bear.

B000XCZGV8|5.0|This is one of the best films I've ever seen on the subject of crime and criminals, and the effect crime has on the people who get caught up in it. Director David Fincher took the original memoir of San Francisco Chronicle journalist Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie) and fashioned it into a story that is less a whodunit than it is a character study of obsession and its consequences. We may never know the truth about the crazed killer, but this film gives us a good idea of what Graysmith and various other journalists, cops, and Feds went through in their pursuit of him. By concentrating on victims and bystanders rather than the perp himself, Fincher has managed to convey a sense of the true horror of violent crime. He's also made a suspense film that Hitchcock himself would admire. The entire cast is excellent, and the sense of time and place (1960s-70s San Francisco) is vivid. I'll never forget it. Highly recommended.

006202406X|1.0|(SPOILERS AHEAD, SO DONT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVENT READ THE BOOK)<br /><br />I must admit I was so eager to read Allegiant that I had to put down the book I was reading at the time. I'm a fan of Dystopian stories and strong female leads, having loved The Hunger Games and the first 2 books of Divergent. In fact, I devoured Divergent in 1 or 2 days, I could hardly put it down. While it is true I love the 'happily ever after' endings and so on, I can put up with bittersweet or sad ones as long as the ending creates a sense of hope and satisfaction to the reader and serves a purpose. There is no hope and there is no purpose in this book and all I can feel towards it is the betrayal of the author. I don't want to feel as if I wasted either my money or my time reading it, don't get me wrong, I love reading, but this book has the worst trilogy ending I have ever read!<br /><br />So let's get started...<br /><br />I think one of the major flaws in the book is the fact that it is written, supposedly, from 2 different points of view, 'Tris and Tobias', but I found myself several times flipping back to see whose point of view I was reading. There were no differences between the two voices.... first failing!<br /><br />Now let's talk about the plot.... has it got a plot at all? I don't think so. This is a repetitive, boring story, in which there are chapters and chapters with our heroes milling around doing nothing, so dull..... In the first 2 books I was so involved with the thought of the Dystopian Chicago, I fell in love with the five factions, how they interacted with each other and was so intrigued by what was beyond the fence that when I realised what was going on, nothing made sense to me and it was completely illogical. It seems as if another author wrote this book. I think Veronica Roth ruined the whole trilogy with this one. On the one hand we have the full action-packed story of the first two books and on the other hand this pathetic story with no plot and a devastating ending.<br /><br />And what about the main characters? What happened to Tobias in this book? He was supposed to be the Dauntless leader, a man with no fear, a man with strength and bravery, not a follower, not somebody who follows directions. All the awesomeness he has in the other books, disappears in Allegiant and an out of character Tobias appearswho has nothing to do with the real one. And Tris?? she developed nothing but arrogance and stubbornness in this book, a girl who always gets her way in everything and make sure everybody follows her plans. Even worse, what about her death? The more I think about it, the more frustrated I get. I mean, If you are going to kill off the main character it had better make sense, her death is nothing but pointless! When Dumbledore died in Harry Potter, he HAD to die because his death meant something for the story. But Tris? She was supposedly an invincible girl, even immune to the death serum and she ended up being shot by a gun? She dies even without knowing if her death was worth it or not. I don't get it. Not to mention the epilogue, in which Tobias faces the new world with the burden of not having his beloved girlfriend, even his story remains unresolved.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this story, I wish I could have given it five stars instead of one and all I can say after finishing the story is I wish I hadn't started the Trilogy. So, I would not recommend this book to anyone, it's definitely not worth either your time or your money. I feel completely ripped-off. I want my money back and this book erased from my memory! I think Veronica Roth could have made a name for herself, but after finishing this piece of writing of hers, it's highly likely that unless she changes the formula in her writings, her books won't delight the readers any longer.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Argh! I loved this series so much. Divergent was one of my favorite books. But this book, what happened?!? The whole introduction of a new world and new plot lines was too much for one book. If she wanted to go with the story she did, I think it would have been better with more books. It was too rushed and difficult to understand. And I was really annoyed by the Tris and Tobias dynamic. They spent pretty much the entire book fighting. Neither of them acted the same way they did in Divergent. Yes I know characters evolve, but it took away what made them special! Tris is supposed to be strong but caring and selfless. In this book she was hardheaded, temperamental and not at all like Tris from the pat books. Tobias was whiny and stupid, which made me mad because in earlier books he was strong, independent, and he could think for himself and come up with a good decision on his own. As other reviewers have noted, Tris and Tobias often sounded as if they were the same person. I would have to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose POV I was in. I really really really wanted to like this book. But I couldn't. I found no way to connect to it.  The ending was not because of what happened but because of the how it happened and technology reactions of the other characters; they didn't match the rest of the book. Do over please? I am not sure what I expected from this series but this definitely wasn't it.

1451666179|5.0|Originality is hard to come by in a day and age where digital fame is so attainable. But blogger-turned-author, Allie Brosh, has managed the impossible—to stand out in the ever-growing vastness of the internet with her award-winning blog Hyperbole and a Half. I mean, who hasn’t wanted to READ ALL THE THINGS?!<br /><br />I’ve been a huge fan of the blog for quite some time so I was really excited when I found out she was releasing a book of the same name. I’m usually weary of blog books because many contain a disproportionately large amount recycled content. And while I will admit there are reused posts in Hyperbole and a Half, there is a good balance of old favourites and new material, enough to keep it familiar but still interesting.<br /><br />I think what makes Brosh so popular is her self-depreciating humour and the blatant honesty behind it. She acknowledges the hard truths alongside the absurd, is completely upfront about her shortcomings and accepts who she is without ever apologizing for it. These are all traits that I really admire and I think it’s what makes her stories so relatable and, in turn, her blog so successful. There’s also a dark wisdom underlying her work, especially with regard to the segment on depression. Being that I am someone who’s struggled with depression in the past, I can especially appreciate what she’s done here. She takes a concept few truly understand and manages to bring some clarity to it. It’s hard for me to explain what she’s with adequate coherency so I urge you to read it for yourself and see.<br /><br />On top of it all, I can’t forget to mention the accompanying illustrations which are so simplistic in nature that they become effective. These cute yet crude drawings are surprisingly detailed and, even more surprisingly, they’re good. They are good because they are simple. They are simple as to not distract from the overall message. They help to add new layers of meaning and comedy to the story in a way that words otherwise can’t. They are the perfect complement to the directness and the occasional harshness of her storytelling. The combination of Brosh’s pictures and words bring about a whole host of feelings to the reader, from laughter to hope to sympathy and even sometimes sadness. She makes you, the reader, feel things. And isn’t that the point?<br /><br />Food for Thought: Hyperbole and a Half is one of the very few successful examples of a blog to book transition. The book is poignant, funny, touching, relatable, creative, if not, a little extreme. But that’s exactly why it’s so funny. She’s a natural-born storyteller, a comic genius and an ing&eacute;nue. Brosh’s cleverness is to be admired, as are her killer MS Paint skills. She will push it to the limit, embrace the absurd and in the end, live to tell another story. This is a book I highly recommend to fans of the blog and new readers alike.ay that words otherwise can’t. They are the perfect complement to the directness and the occasional harshness of her storytelling. The combination of Brosh’s pictures and words bring about a whole host of feelings to the reader, from laughter to hope to sympathy and even sometimes sadness. She makes you, the reader, feel things. And isn’t that the point?<br /><br />Food for Thought: Hyperbole and a Half is one of the very few successful examples of a blog to book transition. The book is poignant, funny, touching, relatable, creative, if not, a little extreme. But that’s exactly why it’s so funny. She’s a natural-born storyteller, a comic genius and an ingénue. Brosh’s cleverness is to be admired, as are her killer MS Paint skills. She will push it to the limit, embrace the absurd and in the end, live to tell another story. This is a book I highly recommend to fans of the blog and new readers alike.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy and intuitive to use for the most part. An essential idea sketchpad for me which I use all the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is so fun but don't be fooled it is VERY addicting I play it all day long into my device dies
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is like the best game for anyone it's that good so if you want to know try it and have a blast.
B008J8KBKY|5.0|This is a connect four variation--you play on a 3D grid.  It is quite beautiful.  You are invited to register, but you can play as a guest against the computer or against another local player.  You can also play with airplane mode turned off as a guest.  If you register, you can play against other players online.  I didn't register as that didn't interest me.<br /><br />There is a tutorial you can play and replay.  You can turn off some of the effects, such as lensflares and effects.  Achievements earned as &#34;guest&#34; are retained, as near as I could tell.<br /><br />I enjoyed the game.  In easy mode, the computer, for the first couple levels, seemed to ignore some obvious moves, but that didn't last.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Wonderful, exciting plot integrating the X-men story with (real) history, beautiful cinematography and special effects, and no overacting.  Loved it.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|5 stars for a well written series. 5 stars for a terrific final book. So glad I found Jennifer Armentrout!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This album is what I would have expected from Stryper years ago.  While other efforts, ('Reborn', 'Murder By Pride', etc.), weren't without their high points; this CD is strong from start to finish.  As a whole, this is probably the 'hardest', or 'most metal' CD Stryper has ever put out.  It has more of an edge to it than their 80's stuff, (likely because it lacks the over-production so typical in the 'hair band' days); but is on-par with what you'd expect from Stryper.  Good guitars, strong vocals, signature Robert Sweet drums and a message that, while it doesn't beat you over the head, also refuses to be ignored or watered-down.  Rather than calling listeners to be 'Free' to make choices, or having ballads that could be taken as sung to God, or a significant other or a friend, this CD's message states that a Revelation is coming - things will be revealed, battles will take place, and that the truth is the truth and you have to deal with it.  Every song on this CD is good.  Unlike the last couple of studio CDs, (excluding \\"The Covering\\" - a CD of cover tunes, and \\"Second Coming\\" - a CD of re-recordings of old Stryper songs), I don't have to pick and choose songs to listen to.  The whole thing is good.  The whole thing ROCKS.<br />Oh, and I'm also a big fan of the artwork on the cover!  It's something I liked about the original release of \\"To Hell With The Devil\\" and about albums in general; and in this digital age, it's refreshing to see a CD cover tell a story and be worthy of hanging on a wall.  Even the photo on the back is cool.  It shows the guys - now - wearing the old outfits and in the same pose as what was on the back of the \\"To Hell With The Devil\\" album in 1986.  I think that shows their sense of humor and I happen to LOVE IT.  This album is a winner from start to finish.  Musically AND visually!<br /><br />I bought the CD/DVD Deluxe edition and it's good to have a couple of videos for the new songs at my fingertips with the DVD.  The only thing I wouldhave liked to see different in regards to the music videos, would maybe be to have a couple of the older videos on there, as well...just as a bonus/treat for us long-time fans.  Hopefully they come out with a video collection on DVD, (maybe with a live video recorded - for a change - in the U.S.).<br />What I would've liked to see in regards to the 'making of' video feature, would've been to maybe have the whole group sitting together and answering questions and giving commentary.  Instead, we get Michael Sweet making comments about each track on the CD and then there are a few short comments from the other guys peppered in.  It seems very heavy on Michael's views.  I'd have liked to see them all in one room, all giving their thoughts about each track and putting the CD together and what they hope going forward.  But, hey...it's a short 'making of' and two videos; and it's not why I bought it.  I bought it for the CD and this CD is a winner from start to finish!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I enjoyed the writer's style and craft. The unpredictability of the story kept it a page turner. Now i need to watch the series to see if HBO was able to do it justice.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric Burdon had made a very good album. His best in a few years. If you are an Animals fan, you will love this disc as much as I do.
B00CATSONE|4.0|this was a good little read on creativity and genius. could have been a little more in-depth on the life of Tesla but still found it enjoying.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Too complicated for this senior. Too many steps to install and use. Does not compare to the Roku which sets up automatically and has a remote. i will be replacing this with another Roku.
B009CVRQLY|1.0|After being such a Celine fan since 1991 this album is honestly horrible .... She should stick to her soultry angelic tunes instead of trying to be a pop diva and doing duets with hip hop artist ... 1 star out of 5
B007U4DDXK|5.0|I got this movie in the mail pretty quickly. It was in great shape, only thing is the box said it came with a plush chihuahua toy and it didn't, which is fine because when I ordered it, it wasn't supposed to. Overall no problems.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is a fun little time sink, but there isn't any real point to it. I don't like games that want you to buy extra stuff.
B008QLXSG8|4.0|Camus successfully illustrates that there is something missing throughout the entire book namely remorse or any emotion whatsoever. There is more to life than worrying about how hot it is outside.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I'm an avid reader, and was told that this was a decent read. Personally I thought I was reading one of my daughter's 5th grade books. Rice jumps around like she's making it all up as she plows doggedly along in the sporadic storyline. World development was commented on in a post I read elsewhere, but I didn't feel like I was in any place different other than having 2 Sun's and multi-colored stars. I'll pass this one onto the kids.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Great movie, I think I may have to buy the DVD and watch it again and again. Was cheap enough to justify renting from Amazon.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie its a must watch. Very good outdoor filming and great acting. 5 stars for sure!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I think its a fun game! I like the battle setup it reminds me of final fantasy. witch are some of the greatest games of all time
B00DQZQSNO|4.0|Nice.  Bought mainly for protection of the Kindle.  Fits well and can prop the unit up to use it.  Good purchase.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Guillermo del Toro gives to us a great movie, you feel like the pilots in the robots, and despite the sci-fi elements you can enjoy this epic history about survival against powerful beings from another dimension.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|I am a big Nicolas Sparks fan! As usual this one did not disappoint! Read the book and still enjoyed the movie.
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|It's a nice, well-designed case.  Very solid with a nice fit.  My only gripe with this case is that I tend to like cases with a little more grip on the sides so it doesn't slip out of my hand.
0385537697|5.0|Absolutely love love loved these books!  I highly recommend.  They were such a quick read, I wish they never would end!  Can't wait for more!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Rawlins always gets me hooked by the end of the first page or two.  Quick read and exciting. Love this guy.
006114665X|2.0|\\"The Sleepwalkers\\" could indeed be the right word that could describe the potential readers oblivious to the established historical facts - they might become victim of this revisionist ploy masquerading as historical research.<br /><br />This book is insult to the memory of millions who perished in The Great War on both sides. They died, not because of some \\"sleepwalker theory\\" as the book implies, but because of documented murderous INTENT of German and Austrian-Hungarian policy makers.<br /><br />Books of such flavor were quite in vogue after 1933 in Nazi Germany. Disturbing.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I don't want to be forced to do this before I go home to read another book.  It is silly
B00DB624GS|5.0|Peter Green's masterpiece, Danny Kirwan's finest moments. The impassioned playing, spot on vocals, off the scale jamming, just wonderful! This edition restores the original UK running order, as well as including the Oh Well and Green Manalishi singles and b sides.
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|Its been close to two years since Drakes last album, Take Care. Nothing Was The Same follows the same path. Drizzy is out to up the ante this time around. Right out the gate, Whitney Houston's classic \\"I Have Nothing\\" gets flipped and reversed on \\"Tuscan Leather\\" as Drake drops three dope verses. The six minute intro has him detailing the fallout he had with Nicki (Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin' I dropped the ball on some personal s***, I need to embrace it) and these hot for the moment rappers (I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now). Then he uses that \\"versace\\" flow on \\"The Language\\", and even though Birdman tried to deny it, Drake is obviously responding to Kendrick Lamars \\"Control\\" verse. Check out some quotes from the song (F*** any n**** that's talkin' that s*** just to get a reaction), ( I got to kill off the weak s*** that's got all you n***** excited) and (Talking that s*** with your back to me, just know it always get back to me). If yall think otherwise, please let me know. But I can read between the lines.<br /><br />Drake slows the tempo down on the piano laced \\"From Time\\". Jhené Aikos hook complements the beat very well. In the second verse, he admits to messing things up with his girl (Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I f***** up the vision Learnin' the true consequences of my selfish decisions). \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\", which should of been called \\"It's Yourz\\" transitions into \\"Own It\\". Supposedly a remix with the WU will be coming out soon. Certain members confirmed it. The poppish \\"Hold On, We're Going Home\\" featuring Majid Jordan is a good second single. More highlights from NWTS are \\"Furthest Thing\\", \\"Too Much\\" featuring Sampha and Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2 featuring Jay-Z, where Drake admitted he threw a swipe at Jay on there when he said \\"I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me\\". Aint nothing wrong with a little friendly competition right? NWTS isn't perfect though and Am I only the one who thought \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\", \\"Own It\\", & \\"Connect\\" were kinda weak?<br /><br />The constant beat changes got a little annoying. And \\"Worst Behavior\\" was terrible. Another thing I wanted to mention is that Drake is a way better rapper than a singer. His singing is good enough just to get by on, but its nowhere near great as some may say. He should focus less on the haters, come on now, how many times can you address the haters? Seriously. Everybody is not gonna be a fan of your music, just accept it fam. Whining about it all the time isnt gonna change it. But all in all, NWTS was a grower, I wasn't really feeling it on first listen, but like I said it grew on me. And with production from Noah \\"40\\" Shebib, Boi-1da, Jake One, Chilly Gonzales, Nineteen85 and many others, Drake continues to make himself a household name.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I tried four apps for my Kindle Fire HDX, and found this one to be the best.<br /><br />When opening the app, choose the Full viewer and not &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34;.  My Fire HDX had issues with mobile.<br />There are ads, but they are easy to ignore as they scroll the bottom of the screen.  And, importantly, no annoying popup adds.  The app &amp;#34;FB for Kindle fire&amp;#34; has a deceptive popup every time you leave the app, and this app does not.<br /><br />This app is great if you need to access a second Facebook account
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I like this series of books, makes for an excellent read, disappointed in who they chose to play Grey in the movie though.
B00AZ7V0W0|1.0|None of the movies in this collection are true Blu-Ray editions.  Instead, the movies have merely been transferred to a Blu-Ray disc.  The movies don't look any better than any of the previous DVD releases, and in fact, this edition has less material included than previous collector's editions.  I could've done with fewer special features had the films been true Blu-Ray quality, so steer clear of this set if you already own the films on DVD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun<br />very good layout. great colors to choose from. addictive!<br />makes you want to over and over to get faster and faster.
B001NHNG64|4.0|What a fun read!  Although at times Reacher's luck or perceived invincibility bear question, this was a great second installment in the character's arc.  I enjoyed the glimmer of normalcy in the claustrophobia he faces.<br /><br />Very entertaining.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Best Series ever!  I missed recording the first 3 and didn't want to watch the rest till I saw them.  Couldn't get at my library.  To popular.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|You have to be a John Corey fan to really appreciate the humor in this book. But it moves along quickly and you can read it in a day or two.
034580404X|5.0|very well written keeps you reading on and on,keeps you wanting more,makes you think that the person that wrote the books now everyone in it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Absolutely loved Liane Moriarty's story telling abilities. Beautiful story, beautiful characters, wonderful pace. If you are looking for a novel that will keep you up turning pages, The Husband's Secret is a good bet.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Easy access to my published pages on Facebook.  I can easily check messages and status quickly. Thanks Amazon for supplying app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just read this book. I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with it. One of the best books I have ever read. Ever. I have leukemia, the last thing I wanted to read was a sappy book about people dying from cancer. This was not that. This was existentialism at its best. It was thought provoking wisdom interspersed with moments of such unbelievable clarity on the human condition that it required setting the book down for a moment and realizing the impact of what was just said. Read this book, you will be a better human for having done so.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really enjoyed this story.  It's a must read and keeps you intrigued the entire time. There are still some unanswered questions but left for the reader to ponder. I highly recommend the book.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Great book by Baldacci. The series of The Camel Club are books that you can't wait to get to. Red in order they tell a story of a group of people that work to keep our great country on track. I've read them all, then suggested to my wife that she read them and I found her at 2/3 in the morning, not being able to put them down.
B003EYDU60|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for my grandchildren at their request.  The Kids loved it. Great family movie.
0140067477|5.0|I truly love this book. It's very interesting how it switches between story and learning's and I also love the way it uses the Poo and the forest characters to share thoughts on how Taoism is understood and taught. If you've ever been interested in the learning's of Tao, this is an excellent start and  you'll have a ton of fun reading it. I've read it several times and keep it by my chair at all times.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This is probably a really good game if you can get it to download. I've been trying for a week and it won't load. I installed it but it won't let me play it.I'm rating it a 1star unless this is fixed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|F you Veronica. That was a horrible ending. How could you do that to us? I will never forgive you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun cool I thought it was better then temple run because this game feels more for kids then temple run
B006OAB3ME|1.0|Dear Paul:<br /><br />In case you hadn't heard, Ringo and Rod Stewart tried the \\"Standard Songbook\\" approach in their solo careers as well.<br /><br />It didn't work for them, either.<br /><br />Sorry, old boy...as a lifelong fan, it breaks my heart but i gotta say: this one sucks.<br /><br />Keep on the path you got on with \\"Chaos and Creation In The Backyard\\", \\"Memory Almost Full\\" and even parts of \\"New\\". THAT'S the Macca we all know and love.<br /><br />Not this crap.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|Amazing toy to play around. Best operated with iPhone. Very addivtive and easy to use. Best if combine with a nubby :)
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The staff was beyond helpful and the time that was spent with me was greatly appreciated.  However, the USB cable was not the problem; my Kindle was just dead.  Should I return the cable?
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Nathan Fillion continues to bring his  Malcolm Reynolds charm to this great TV series combined with an amazing and coherent casting I continue to have high hopes for this show.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who loves the Bourne trilogy.<br />Great price, fast shipper. Excellent set of movies.
0142501123|5.0|This is the best Halloween book ever. Bought it last year for my daughter and she still likes to read it with me. We even read it to her preschool class for their costume party. Doing the different voices for the Witch, Dragon and animal friends are fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome that you can mine and kill zombies it's the best game I EVER had minecraft is on KINDLE FIRE HD
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Who would 1 star this game it is awsome<br />I will five star this. It is free and you can get lots of different weapons
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really enjoy this game the graphics are great and its fun to play I wish there was a faster way to earn money for tack and accessories but other than that great :-)
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Love this game! So fun &amp; addicting! I downloaded a few hours ago &amp; can't put it down.. lol! If your into pool, you should definantly download this game! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This Candy Crush game is very addictive but I wish the Amazon Appstore had the free version of Candy Crush without you having to pay for extra lives.
B00EEXPDTM|3.0|This was not at all what I expected. Amanda Seyfried was stunning as always. The script on the other hand, was a sad attempt at a biopic. Glad I saw it at home!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game to play .Awsome way to wast an hour when your bord.Love how you can make lots of thing like crafting tables and that.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Don't let the Japanese cover from the image fool you. It works perfectly as intended for all regions, and it's comfortable. Though it is a shame that it works on a very few games at the moment (Monster Hunter, Kid Icarus, Resident Evil: Revelations, and Metal Gear Solid 3D if I recall correctly).
B001P4ESGC|5.0|Lots of drama and suspense, with hooks at end of each episode that makes you want to watch the next, then next.  Great acting, well done scripts.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Loving Frank: A Novel was an interesting take on the life of Frank Lloyd Wright. It made me want to read more about him and see what kernels of truth were woven into the fiction. I especially wanted to know if the ending was the real deal. If so, how terribly, terribly tragic. I really didn't feel it was a love story. Too many lives were destroyed.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Enjoyable plot with many twists.  Great actors with great scripts and visual effects.  Well executed and exposed magic tricks.  Would recommend to a friend.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This story was a wonderful surprise...I purchased the book on a whim, and am now delighted by the find.  My thanks to the author.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My daughter loved this book. She couldn't put it down. She was very moved and cried at the end. She connected with the characters in the book and said they were very well developed.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|I enjoyed the dvd very much. Great music. Great remembrances of Queen. Miss Freddie Mercury very much- a great talent. Because of these dvds, we can still rock out to the greatest rock band ever.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It's hard to imagine the terrifying experience the children went through, let alone the little boy left behind hidden in a cupboard.
B009DH379C|5.0|What a great concert! Queen rocked like no other band could!  I also enjoyed the personal touch of seeing each band member shopping, going up in a hot air balloon,etc., in their own time away from the stage. Freddie's voice was A+ in range that night!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is typical SK. This novel needed to be done.  Finally get to find out what happened to Doc after leaving the &#34;EVIL&#34; hotel.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Unbelievable concert! Greatest live band ever! You feel like you're at Wembley Stadium. Forever Queen!!! Rock on, Amen! Love Queen!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it now that Candy Crush is finally on the kindle. Been waiting a long time for this one.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I fell in love with the characters and story line in Divergent.  Insurgent kept those fires burning for me.  I waited with anticipation and excitement for this to come out and couldn't wait to dive into it once it did.  Right from the start I was disappointed and the ending left me irritated.  Why? Why? Why did the author feel the need to change the point of view of the story every other chapter?  I am so disappointed and would not recommend this book to anyone who loved the first 2.
B008J8KBKY|5.0|I used to play this with my cousins, many years ago as a board game of course.  I have looked on the app stores on occasion for a computer version and now it's finally here!  Thanks for this classic that I can play anywhere and at any time...and without having to find someone willing to play it for more than a game or two!:)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book did a great job of depicting a post-apocalyptic nation on the verge of a second civil war. While this book is written for Young Adults, Adults would enjoy this action/adventure/survival story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's such an awesome novel. Didn't put it down till I finished it. I can't imagine what life will be if this was real.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game entertains everyone in the family from the two year old to the grandma. Everyone loves it. It is challenging at the higher levels. The only problem we had is that it stopped responding and we had to delete it and download it again a couple of times. Otherwise, we love it.  Addendum: I have since discovered that when this game stops responding, it will work again and keep all of your levels if you simply re-boot the Kindle. Wish I had known this sooner. I hope they can fix this glitch.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does what any calculator should do, calculates.  This easy to use app. is good to have around in this age of math challenged individuals and as I age I find it more convenient to have a calculator than find pencil and paper to deal with life's everyday math problems.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|ARTPOP is such a consistent album; it's basically fun electric dance music all the way through with the exception of Dope. It's a refreshing change of pace from Gaga's previous album (Born This Way). I think it's a lot more radio-friendly than said album as well which is a good thing, and it's not as over-produced either. My favorite tracks are Aura, Sexxx Dreams, Manicure, Artpop, Fashion! and Gypsy.
B00C0WBU7I|4.0|I have to confess that I wasn't familiar with Pusheen before I saw one of my friends reading this book on Goodreads. She mentioned that the book was available for reviewers on netgalley and after spending about half an hour browsing through the Pusheen the cat website I couldn't resist requesting a copy. I am a sucker for cute cat pictures and videos, I have all of the Simon's Cat books and regularly flick through them when I need something to make me smile so after giggling my way through the most popular posts on the website I knew I'd enjoy this book too.<br /><br />I will say that this is the kind of book that I prefer to buy in print rather than in ebook. In my opinion the images never look as good on an ereader or computer screen and this is the style of book I like to be able to just pick up and open at a random page when I need something to brighten up my day. I'm pretty sure I'll be buying myself a print copy of this to add to my collection.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed that so many of the cartoons were ones I had already come across though. I would say that the majority were ones I'd seen previously on the website and like I already said I've only visited the site once. I think people who have been following the site for years might find that even more disappointing than I did. Having said that if you're new to Pusheen or a super fan of the cartoons then I'm sure the pictures will still make you smile. Pusheen is incredibly cute and reminded me a lot of my cats with her obsession with food and sleeping.<br /><br />If you're unsure about whether to buy the book or not then I'd highly recommend checking out the Pusheen the Cat website to help you make up your mind. You can also see some sample pictures from inside the book on Amazon
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game our family doesn't allow  killing so it's good there are games that feel like killing animals . You should get it ,its so fun .
B00006JIA4|5.0|Missing 3 songs: tie your mother down, stone cold crazy, and love of my life.  Aside from all of the good popular songs, Got plenty of great songs that will grow on you like radio ga ga.<br /><br />Also disc 3 is just okay, more like a tribute to Freddie.  Elton John sings &#34;show must go on&#34; on disc 3 which is now my favorite Elton John performance.<br /><br />I got these discs 5 months ago and still play the heck out of em.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Keeps me entertained and at the same time frustrated. The levels become more challenging as you go ..... love it anyway!!!
B000LXHK22|4.0|Nice to watch an amusing and tender film with no violence or profanity.A very sincere tale of life in Provence
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This app does just what it says, soothes and relaxes.  The choices are great I love the variety of sounds. It can also be entertaining to see how many sound combos you can come up with.
B008M721MS|1.0|I got the app but apparently it does not work with my Kindle Fire. That is highly disappointing. There also does not seem to be one that works.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Because it is a good look at the times in that time period. We love the people and their life struggles.
0140186395|5.0|I happened to read this book at a time when the events and relationships in the book were relatable. Having had time to really digest it, I have found that this is a book that really sticks with you. I still wonder what the characters are doing, what drove them, etc. Upon finishing this book, I found the symbolism, parallels, moralism and the artistry of words make this the greatest book I have ever read.
B00361CAEE|5.0|Insightful.  This documentary was compelling and exciting.  It told you the unglamorous part about magazine publishing.  It felt raw and unfiltered.  It is amazing the underlined distain some of these people have for each other.  It's a bit sad to see the superficial attitudes and unresolved issues no one wants to talk about with each other.
0679745203|1.0|I thought the movie was awful and plodding. I don't know why I would have thought differently about the book. I barely got through it. The one redeeming quality was the author's ability to paint a picture for you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, but if you try a board a couple of times without passing it, you will have to wait a while or pay.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|good CD and good group and positive music<br />i recommend this group to everybody has good message<br />reach the world with one thing  proclaim the gospel
B003G4W49C|5.0|Artistic, intelligent and entertaining. I couldn't put it down. I was a little concerned at first but greatly rewarded for my effort.

B001N9ESQ4|4.0|THIS IS THE END OF A VERY NICE SERIES OF MOVIES ABOUT THIS COUPLE.  IN THE FIRST MOVIE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE MOSTLY WRITTEN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, BUT BY THE THIRD AND LAST MOVIE, I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE SERIES.
1587613379|5.0|This book has so many great ways of re-conceptualizing relationships, whether you are gay, straight, bi, poly, or anything inbetween. My mind was definitely expanded after reading this book. This started out as a text book for one of my sexuality classes, and has since become a staple in my personal library.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|A must-see, very hard to watch, made me cry during and after.  It's time for SeaWorld and all exploitive sea parks to close.  Captivity belongs in no civilized society.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this version of Castleville i loved playing it on fb .I couldn't play on my kindle. Thing is you need a ton of gold and crowns and if you don't have them it will take you forever to do anything. Unless your willing to shell out real money then be prepared to go real slow. I would have given 5 stars if you could make friends on zynga like you can with the original.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book is awesome and Cassandra Claire is super awesome for writing it. It's a suspenseful, adventurous, romantic (but not sappy) novel that surprised me at every turn, even though this is the second time I read it. It's unique and I suggest you read it, but read &#34;The City of Bones first, that's the first book.<br />Fandom Instagram: percyjacksonsister<br />Wattpad: PeaceLoveMine

B00BBA6FMU|4.0|The book was very compelling to read and, all the time, I was wondering if this could be a true story.  Very heartfull, somewhat similar to &#34;The Help&#34;.  Sad, the circumstances of the African blacks imported as slaves.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I would give it a much higher rating but the app has a annoying habit of attaching a photo you are trying to post post to another group. The app gives you this vauge direction but not  enough for the average FB user to understand. There are good things like the ability to attach a picture to a chat msg. I too am annoyed with the msg to &#34;update the app&#34; & then taken to google play.  Having that carrot dangled in front of me again.  Sheesh when is google going to get together with us kindlers?

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun for kids of all ages. there is no violence, no scary levels, and really exciting. You don`t even need to spend thousands of dollars either. Stuff is reasonably priced and its easy to acquire the bananas. Enjoy!
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|Don't hesitate on getting it or not, just get it!!! This album is sooo amazing. Lyrically, they write some great stuff. They deliver a positive message of hope and still intense enough to get through your workouts! I've been an ABR fan for a couple years and this does not disappoint!

If you don't have a strong signal it won't work that well. Simple as that.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|So after moving and updating my old computer i decided to buy another HP as ive had no problems with em. Decided to install a tx650 and to my dismay there was almost no room in the case. The hp case is dwarfed by how massive this case is. Will put pics side by side. Installation was a breeze the thumb screws for the side panels make it easier. Tons of room behind the motherboard tray i posted a picture of the wires i have all zipped up clean out of the way. So far so good top fan is quiet and rear fan is as well. Fan at motherboard set 1000rpm and top set to 800 with the switch i dropped about 8-10c° at idle from the gpu and cpu and about 10c running furmark off the GPU at load. This is with the stock fans installed. Ordered a front intake fan and will see the difference.<br /><br />Reason for the 3 star is the USB 3.0 doesnt work at all. Plugged it in and windows didn't recognize my devices in one port and the other didn't function. Plugging it into USB 2.0 one port worked and one didn't. Contacted ANTEC and was told to email antec in europe but no response back yet. Will call again to make sure i get it fixed. For people who notice it doesn't come with a usb 2.0 adapter mine came with a 2.0 header attached to the 3.0 to plug into the motherboard.<br /><br />Update: So after getting in touch with Antec Europes RMA department there sending me a new replacement usb/audio header for the case. I will plug it in first and turn the computer on make sure it works before i go around cutting zip ties.<br /><br />Update 2: Antec customer service is top notch. 5 out 5. After contacting Antec US and having them tell me to Contact Antec europe i did. Was sent a new header/usb port was installed and was not working either. Called Antec US and they directly and immediately sent me another one to try out. This one does the same thing. Turns out the HP motherboard im using might have the USB 3.0 plug on the motherboard differently pinned as the HP usb 3.0 one works perfect. Case has been flawless, front filter works awesome and collects tons of dust (good thing).<br /><br />Update: Finally purchased an SSD (yes im late to the party). What i realized right away is with my Corsair TX650v2 power supply mounting the ssd to the back or the bottom where the antec says too is not possible without a sata power extension. So i instead mounted it with the kingston bracket in a 3.5in bay, had to drill the tool less clips so i can screw the bracket into it. Work perfect and might leave it this way.<br /><br />Update 2. Just replaced some parts and built a new pc using existing parts as well. A noctua nh-u14s wil fit in this case no problem with room to spare. My guess is max cooler height is about 170mm max.filter works awesome and collects tons of dust (good thing).    Update: Finally purchased an SSD (yes im late to the party).

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|In a nutshell, I would recommend this app to anyone wanting to learn a second language! The languages available to learn are Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, and Italian.<br /><br />After two weeks of using this app (in conjunction with an Italian workbook), I have advanced rapidly into learning the Italian language! I tried several other apps (and podcasts, too!) to learn Italian before I discovered this one. When it comes to learning for free, not one of the other apps or podcasts came close to being as useful and fast as Duolingo! I appreciate that I am learning some simple sentence structure rather than only vocab words. I like the variety of learning drills. Translate written sentences from Italian to English and vice versa, listen to Italian being spoken and write out in Italian what was said, translate by picking from a selection of words, and learning new nouns by choosing the right picture.<br /><br />One thing I'd like to  mention is that it may be useful to do some study of verb conjugation on your own to avoid some confusion while learning from Duolingo. This app does not walk you through boring verb conjugations; instead you are meant to pick them up as you progress. The good side to this is no boring verb conjugation drills or charts to slog through! The downside is that not knowing a little about verbs ahead of time may add frustration to your Duolingo learning experience.<br /><br />I believe there is no better way currently to learn a new language for free! Great app!
B004SIP7F8|5.0|This is a genuine cinematic treat: an epic movie, beautifully produced, with a lush and memorable music score, and superb performances from the cast.<br /><br />The story is complex and multi-layered. There's love found and lost, loyalty and betrayal, life and death.<br /><br />All this set against a background of WWII.<br /><br />Some impatient viewers may find this drawn out and dull. But, my view is that it is like a fine wine- to be enjoyed!<br /><br />A genuine masterpiece.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive and it plays well on my Kindle Fire HD.  The graphics are really good.  Keep up the good work !!!!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is a well made movie of the all time great musical, based on the Gaston Leroux novel, which was published as a serial in 1909-1910.<br /><br />It's an excellent transformation from the stage to the screen- the changes to make the stage production \\"cinematic\\" are sensitive.<br /><br />The performances are excellent. The costumes and staging are superb, and the direction is sensitive to the subject matter.<br /><br />For anyone who loves the Lloyd Webber musical, this is a must- as a movie you can watch to enjoy in its own right, as well as a reminder of the play and its music.<br /><br />At the Amazon price, it's excellent value!

B000059XUP|2.0|Coming off the original Crow film, a cult classic in which its star Brandon Lee died in a tragic on-set accident, The Crow: City of Angels had its work cut out for it. Where do you go from there?<br /><br />The Crow: City of Angels (not to be confused with the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan drama City of Angels that was released a couple years later) takes the Crow story out of the darkly stylized pseudo-Detroit to a smoggy stylized pseudo-Los Angeles. Taking place at least 10 years after the original film, an adult Sarah (this time played by Mia Kirschner) has moved to L.A. and become a tattoo artist, but is plagued by dreams of the second arrival of The Crow.<br /><br />But instead of Eric Draven, we get Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez), a mechanic who is resurrected from the dead with the gift of invulnerability after being killed alongside his young son by a gang headed by the local druglord Judah Earl (Richard Brooks). Judah's gang is comprised of Spider Monkey (Vincent Castellanos), Nemo (a young Thomas Jane), Kali (Thuy Trang of Power Rangers fame), and Curve (rockstar Iggy Pop). Ashe sets out to take murderous vengeance against the gang, hunting them down one by one, hoping he'll be reunited with his son's spirit in the afterlife when he's finished. But things become complicated when Ashe and Sarah fall in love, and Judah discovers Ashe's one weakness.<br /><br />So first, the good things about the film: the production design. The film looks great. This polluted, smog-covered L.A. seems like its constantly cast in an jaundiced light, like the whole city is dying of liver failure from all the drugs and decadence its denizens feed itself. Its walls are covered in graffitti, its streets are littered with trash, and any sane person with enough sense would've left for another city long ago (I wonder what a Crow-ized pseudo Seattle or San Francisco would look like, but they're probably just as corrupt and polluted). The first film used Halloween and the night before, Devil's Night, as a backdrop for Eric Draven's story. But this film uses the Day of the Dead (Dio de los Muertos) in a similar way, as both celebrations share similarities. And the film make Day of the Dead look like a pretty cool party that should be observed more often outside of Mexico and L.A.<br /><br />But aside from those bright spots, the film is just not very good. Unfortunately, with a story like The Crow, you often have to follow the same story beats, making the film feel derivative and uninspired. Man gets killed, a loved one is also killed in the process, man returns from the dead, man hunts down and kills his murderers one by one. Lather, rinse, repeat with each sequel. Don't believe me? Also check out The Crow: Salvation. I haven't seen The Crow: Wicked Prayer, but I'm probably not going out on a limb and assuming it's no different. But how else would movie producers attempt to recapture the success of the first film without its star? By rehashing the same story over, and over, and over, and over. This film does attempt a more melancholy tone, but it results in a film feels more slow and plodding. The film's finale feels as butchered as it actually is. The original ending forced Ashe to choose between Sarah and his son, and it's a decision that ultimately leaves him without both of them in the end. However, studio interference led to cuts that removed that choice from the plot, leaving the film with a sense of stiltedness and unresolved ambiguity.<br /><br />City of Angels' script doesn't fare much better. Written by David Goyer (yes, of The Dark Knight Trilogy), the dialogue is somber and vaguely spiritual at times, repetitive at others. Ashe often repeats the last things each gang member said to him before they killed him. It's meant to be ironic, but it becomes stale and predictable really fast.<br /><br />Vincent Perez is miscast as Ashe. Half the time, his dialogue is barely intelligible underneath his thick accent. And I can't even tell what kind of accent it is. Is it French? Is it Italian? Is it Spanish? Where is Ashe supposed to be from? Whatever the case, you can't make out what he's saying. And as for his acting...well, yeah. He doesn't feel very menacing, and he has baffling moments of overacting that are downright comical. There is a scene where he trashes his garage amidst flashbacks of his son, and all it amounts to is a lot of yelling, kicking shelves, and knocking things down. I've seen just about the same amount of genuine emotion in Tommy Wiseau's attempts at angst in The Room, and I can't help but chuckle now.<br /><br />The rest of the cast fills out their parts no better, aside from Iggy Pop. At least Curve comes off sufficiently creepy. Richard Brooks' line delivery feels more like he's reading from a children's book instead of a script. Mia Kirschner's Sarah just doesn't seem to have much of a personality aside from being mopey and doe-eyed. Thuy Trang doesn't even seem like she can handle the film's violent content. It's like she's holding back, and not out of an actor's artistic restraint but because she really doesn't wanna be there.<br /><br />The film's music is decent if not very memorable. There's an ethereal orchestral score, but no particular theme that feels iconic. The film uses the occasional source music, with songs from the likes of Hole, PJ Harvey, Filter, and yes, an Iggy Pop song made the cut. Rock band The Deftones makes an appearance at the Day of the Dead celebration. This film tries to present us with a soundtrack to match the first film's impressive music, but like most of the film as a whole, it too falls short of those lofty ambitions.<br /><br />And that's ultimately what this film is, an attempt to capture the first film's success but a disappointing failure that makes you kinda wish they didn't try.

B0029LCJJS|5.0|Fabulous.  Rhys-Davis is fantastic as the King. He certainly is deserving of further acting parts. The rest of the cast is equally capable
B0045HCJ94|5.0|Saw this play recently performed in Chicago.  It hasn't lost any of its punch.  So, I viewed the film again to see how well it has held up.  Wow!  Sanitized dialogue considered, this film is as close to perfect as anyone could make it.  I recall that, in the 60's, Elizabeth Taylor pretty much shocked the world with her performance.  If you want to have fun (my kind of fun), watch A Place in the Sun and then watch this.  She is one of America's greatest film actresses, no question.

B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|So I'd been waiting for Terraria to finally enter the Amazon Appstore, and overall the game was definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />First off, I'd like to start with the negatives since every other review here so far the been a perfect 5 stars. At first, the game does control a bit awkwardly, but once you get the hang of it that's not much of a problem at all. Certain factors of the game seem unfinished and incomplete, such as certain music tracks seemingly not existing, leading to fabulous glitches such as the default, happy daytime theme playing during boss battles. I assume things like this are simply that, glitches, and will probably be fixed in later patches/updates. The last very important thing that I can think of on the negative side, is that there is a severe lack of customization in the options menu. On singleplayer, the only useful option you seem to have is whether you have 5 or 10 inventory slots in your hotbar at the top of the screen. Things like control pad sizes are completely locked at their default sizes. The reason for this, as far as I can tell, is that the game has complete controller compatibility, as this mobile port is made by the same company that ported Terraria to consoles. It just seems somewhat lazy, much like most of the mobile and console versions' exclusive content, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Now on to the positives. Honestly, there's not much to really say here. I mean, I would say that overall this is a great port, and if you're not sure about whether or not you should purchase it, all I can say is that it is DEFINITELY worth $5, despite the flaws I have with it.<br /><br />Now, about that exclusive content I mentioned in the negative section, I guess I should elaborate. 505 Games added some new items in order to encourage people to purchase their versions of the game on consoles and on mobile devices. This content was made very poorly, everything is either a recolor of a different item, or in the case of a few new enemies, brand new textures made pathetic by the fact that they use identical enemy coding to other enemies that already existed. But honestly, I'm able to look past that simply due to the fact that this is one of my favorite games.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun game to play that will keep you entertained for a pretty long time, look no further than Terraria.nemies, brand new textures made pathetic by the fact that they use identical enemy coding to other enemies that already existed.

B0091REZMW|4.0|Mind stimulating. Nice graphics. Gets more challenging as the game is played. Perhaps getting so tough that it becomes nearly impossible to open any more rooms.
B005ZOCF5E|2.0|Engaging mystery, satisfying payoff, terrific worldbuilding- especially enjoyed the different factions: aquatic, moon, terran, evolvarium.<br /><br />But that couldn't outweigh my dislike for the two main characters. Sunday was self absorbed, Geoffrey was a wimp. Character development aside, what really irritated the shite out of me was how *reactive* they were. They accepted financial and operational help from various parties knowing full well there were strings attached the aid but trotted off with nary a concern about outwitting the \\"partners\\" or potential consequences. They were also weirdly forgiving of betrayal. The supporting characters weren't any more likeable.

B003OAL58E|4.0|It's intriguing and beautifully acted.It has depth and the fact that there is no neat resolution somehow feels right.It is the converse of so much of the trite rubbish offered on general release.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|My rating was based on prior books I've read by Balcacci.  I really enjoy reading his writings.  This book was intertaining but not in the same group as many of his other books.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I grew up watching The Adventures of Superman and enjoyed Christopher Reeve's portrayal as an adult.  This iteration holds true the story of unadulterated virtue and selflessness, not unlike that of an Arthurian knight.  When the chips are down, those qualities NEVER go out of style.  While in this version Clark Kent is the center of attention, his two fathers, Jonathan Kent and Jor-El, display those virtues and instilled them in him (a piece of the story not really emphasized before).  Superheroes rise in print and media when the world needs them.  With the way things are, the world needs to see a Superman right now.  The world needs to see a young man meet seemingly unconquerable challenges, live up to his potential, and prevail...not unlike a generation of men and women have today in their struggles against terrorism.  While many have, more need to see in themselves what we see in Clark Kent.
B00EAM8RR2|5.0|Great games for all ages. I find that your kids as well as adults will enjoy this game all the time. Thanks.
B00EUIO8Y2|2.0|Even though MDNA world tour followed one of her weakest albums to date (is it any wonder that the Confessions tour is her best tour so far?), she still knows how to put on a really good show. I was pretty much pleased with the 5.1 sound and thank God for that.<br />I have read many comments regarding the editing of the blu-ray, but I thought \\"How bad can it be?\\" and I was probably hoping that some people just can't handle some fast editing. Well, I was wrong. The editing is \\"What were they thinking?\\" bad. EVERY SINGLE SECOND is pretty much a cut. Show the crowd - CUT - show a dance move - CUT - show the video playing in the background - CUT. It is just exhausting watching this. The choreography of her concerts is always impressive, but you can't really follow it here, which is a huge shame. I wished that they had put a camera in a corner, filmed the whole thing and just released it as it is.<br />Madonna can still dance and do amazing things on stage, which is more than enough for their fans, but not for her. The lighting is such that you can never really see her face clearly, it's like a ball of light through which you can make out the eyes and the mouth. At some point in the concert, during which she is pretty much undressed, the picture converts into grainy black and white - suspicious timing. If only she could just embrace her age and just let the blu-ray show every wrinkle, she is still a performer on stage that overshadows many of her younger peers.<br />If the editing was proper and the image quality clearer, so that one could actually enjoy watching this show, I would have given it a rating of 4 out of 5.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game when I was playing it my small sister forced me to get this app. this is a good game and a good time waster I like it very very very very much
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's winter time and there is no great feeling than reading a sequel to \\"The Shining\\" under covers on my Kindle.<br /><br />This book literally gave me goosebumps few times.<br />I wish King had given more details about life of \\"Dick Hallorann\\" after he separated from Dan.<br />That being said, this is an excellent follow up and I am sad that this book is over for me.<br /><br />May be I will read both \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Doctor Sleep\\" once again next year.
B00448SE4S|5.0|My 10 year old son read the books and then wanted to see the movie.  He was probably a little young for it but he's pretty mature for his age.  Anyway, he loved it and watched it 3 times in a couple of days.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Dear lord, black cat with pink hair?  Do dolls get better than this?  She's got nice, long hair that's fun to brush, bright pink clothes, and ears and a tail! She actually reminds me of my own sweet kitty, Fenway.  This doll is fun.  Like all of the Monster High Dolls, once she arrived at our home she was given her own personality outside of Canon.  That's what makes dolls fun.<br /><br />Looking for a fun, pretty doll for a little girl?  This one.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Most inovative artist since the 70's highly recommend this lady she's different but has a message of unity of change to kindness dispite her costumes that most people find offensive or strange, but I find them quite the opposite giving me a message to be not afraid of who I am giving me a since of artpop!
B004TN7QPG|5.0|Takes a little time to get the hang of it but this is a real nice tool when you add a text to speech program with it.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you like 50 Shades of Gray...here is the same exact book with different characters and a different plot line. The sex...still super hot, the mystery...keeps on building. I am a huge fan of the 50 trilogy and that's why I love this book.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I kept bypassing  this version of AB because I just didn't want to add the other ones to my phone. But with the use of th elight sabr, slo-mo, and bombs' I was sold.<br /><br />Glad I installed it.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|Oh my this can be rough and tough to play. I like it a nice challenge. Makes me think of the nebula fight at the end of THE RATH OF KAHN when Spock talks about thinking 3 dimensionally. That's this game.
B009O07NDY|5.0|OMG! Who doesn't love this franchise? The movie is spectacular and the soundtrack truly adds to it. The music is emotional and moving, and Howard Shore once again delivers with his orchestrations. Plus, a sweet surprise with Neil Flynn's song. Love, love, love this album!
0689878451|1.0|I brought this book home from the library.  I wished the book would have had some kind of warning about its liberal content.  As a Christian I do not reject anyone and know I am called to love every person (regardless of their sexual orientation).  I can understand this as an adult with a clear concept of who I am am and of what I think is right and and wrong.  However, I do not want my children submitted to this information when their personalities and values are still being formed.  This seemingly innocent book cannot be defined as anything else but BRAINWASHING.  I was very upset and feeling disrespected and invaded in my own home.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As good as always. Can't wait for season 4!  Curious as to what the writers have in store for us...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun game very challenging. I will buy other games like these when I get bored with this one.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Love this app. plays all my movies and music. you can even add items from websites. works well on Fire HD but not on Fire HDX as of this post.
B00742H26M|4.0|Off to very slow start, it got better and turned into an enjoyable movie.  It's slow and calm and sometimes even slightly amusing, but overall fun to watch.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Holy cow! This is probably one of the best modern albums out there right now. I applaud Celine for experimenting with modern-day producers and songwriters as it truly paid off. Her voice is timeless and the songs created on this album are truly outstanding. A lot better than some of the other new releases out there right now, and that statements is coming from a true Pop music junky!
B000JQUZCI|4.0|I've only seen the old black and white movie scenes at random intervals.  I thought I would give the book a read.  Wow!  I can see how this book may have caused a few nightmares in its time.  I only wished I didn't have the preconceived image of the monster in my head and didn't have to force that watered down image into each of the hanous crime scenes Mary Shelley wrote him into.  You find yourself sympathizing with the monster at some points and hating him at others.  I've never read a book that was so poorly represented by the movie industry.  Of course I've never watched any of the newer Frankenstein movies so maybe I will now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Finished within a day. Very engrossing story that kept me reading. Great book for anyone looking for a new series.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I almost put this book down during the first chapter.  Glad my back hurt and I didn't feel like getting up to get another book.  This is a very odd book to say the least.  Never in a million years would I have thought Cinderella would be rewritten as a cyborg.  It is so weird it is good.  Clearly it is a bit predictable as it follows the Cinderella and perhaps Snow White stories, but it is different enough to make a great read.  Stick with it a chapter or two to see if it sucks you in.
0321334876|4.0|Wonderful book with high quality advice on C++ programming style. Also, it's exceptionally well written for the most part. Give it 4 stars instead of 5 because C++11 will probably make some of the recommendations as strongly applicable as before (actually, I think some of the cases where C++11 works against the advice from Meyers is for the worse, not for the better).<br /><br />Highly recommend this book to anyone seriously into C++, along with &#34;Effective STL&#34;, and perhaps also &#34;More Effective C++&#34; (I'm a little less enthusiastic about the last one, but still worth having in your library). Probably also some other title for the transition to C++11 will be required, but I'm not sure yet what to recommend for that.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book. Good read. Interesting subject and history of a time in our country not covered in classrooms.<br />I enjoyed very much.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Amazing psyc thriller. Gruesomely vivid and enthralling plot. Recommend read to all that can handle the gore. Easy 5 star read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best season ending ever.  What a surprise!  I am so in love with this cast of characters.  Can't wait for Season 4
B004JN1D2I|5.0|When I finally gave in to curiosity to take a peek at this \\"Game of Thrones\\" everybody was so crazy about, I would have never imagined that I would find such a well-written, beautifully structured story whose characters would accompany me in my dreams -so drunk I was of my reading- and forever. I can't wait to see what happens next, I'm buying the next book right now. Hope the tv series is good too, because that is next. This is the Lord of the Rings of the 21st century -and even better. The word \\"epic\\" finds its true meaning in Martin's masterpiece.
B00AR0DN3Y|4.0|Touching the void cant help touching your heart. A very moving story, told with honesty, and  no regrets or malice.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This is definitely Gaga's best album to date, don't listen to the negative reviews, it's amazing. The whole piece is a party from start to finish. The album displays Gaga's powerful and skillful vocals and great range. It's just an all around great techno-pop album!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|You have to make sure you don't run out of time. The game is amazing. Should be a way to add friends and earn more energy.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|After I got through the initial pages, this novel had me hooked. Such a wonderful read. Interesting characters, engrossing plot. I spent several evenings reading late into the night. I can't think this book would be a disappointment to anyone.
B00275EHJG|5.0|MY 2 YR OLD NEPHEW IS INTO TOY STORY REALLY DEEP !!  HE WAS EVEN WOODY AT HALLOWEEN. HIS TWIN SISTER IS JUST AS BAD ABOUT THE STORY.  THEY ENJOY WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER ONLY REPLACING IT WITH THE OTHER TOY STORIES. THE SHIPMENT ARRIVED WITHIN 5 WORKING DAYS AND IT FITTED INTO OUR WEEKEND VISITS WITH LESTER GREAT.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Okay, it's a little out there, but one of the best stories of childhood bonding you'll ever read.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Two types of tips work well for the different way the wife and I hold it.  It's a comfortable unit to use and well priced.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|Very good game BUT..... 1. No tutorial on how game plays. 2. No specs on missiles or guns. 3. Radar is almost t useless and no operational information.  Radar needs a zoom toggle  with more enemy information. 4. Gun site is useless almost invisible, too small and no user hints or air to air or dog fight tactical information. 5. No horizon instrument, no instruments except air speed and altitude. 6. Needs operational and tactics tutorial.  7. Have a dogfighting practice mode. Very good. Could be have been the greatest.
034552554X|5.0|Great story! And very interesting about the meanings of different flowers. A book club should pick this one for a read sometime.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Gripping story that gets you vested right away.  Scents so descriptive, it would take me back to India.  A must read.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Installed on my kindle HD and as soon as I try to play a video it crashes and kindle reports the app has stopped working.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|This is a great book - a great study of grief, survival, family, addiction, art, furniture, drugs, redemption, and the fraught passage from childhood to something a little closer to maturity. Like the book of Ecclesiastes, nothing is excluded, nothing invalidated. Go for it - go for it all. Nothing matters, everything matters, out of great good can come great evil, yet out of great evil, great good. The writing pops. How did Donna Tartt get to know all this stuff? I loved her other books, and this one makes three out of three.
B007EDZ20O|5.0|An entertainingly acerbic and convincing analysis of Mother Teresa--whose name for me, after reading Hitchens's disclosures, no longer stands for Christian charity.  Far from it.  Hitchens's revelations have received wide attention; I can only add that the attention has been well-deserved and indeed should be refocused if it is true that Mother Teresa is being fast-tracked to canonization.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an amazing workout.  I started seeing results in 2 weeks!!  I have done Insanity and Turbo Jam.  This is just as good, 1/10th the price and only 20 minutes.  When I did Insanity, I could barely move some days after working out.  Not so with this workout.  It is challenging but not so challenging that you can't get it done.  I can't wait to try more of her workouts!!
B00EQF0JJC|4.0|It's okay, not great. I'm a much  bigger fan of the KB version with Emma Thompson. In fact, this Beatrice pales in comparison to that performance. There were great moments, but not enough to make it memorable
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Maybe most people don't care , but I read reviews.Update ddoesn't allow you to read reviews just shows the average ratings I freaking hate this, have to look for books on the browser now.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|This was a great extension of the movies prior. Great action shots and it was fun to see Miss Potts in the Iron Man suit!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book. I was hesitant to try it, but so glad I decided to read it. Couldn't put it down.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I just love the Star Trek movies! ALL of them! It's fun to see the differences between the classical Star Trek and the newer Star Trek movies!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book was a good read up until the middle. Than it went down hill...fast. The ending, as stated by other reviewers was awful. It ruined the entire book for me. After reading the book and getting to know the two main characters, I didn't believe they would do what they did in the last ten pages. I don't want up spoil it for anyone so I won't be specific. I think the author went totally of course at the end. Very disappointed.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I was thinking about the movie and it's real life implications long after the movie was over! I loved it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|There are a lot of reviews that give solid advice about this game. Take the time to read them. The only thing I would add to the other comments is to suggest downloading a few of the other free g5 games and just switch back and forth between them while waiting for your energy to restore. It's a great game if you take the time to get to know it.
B002NJUN44|3.0|Very different from the book, not that great as a stand-alone movie due to stiff acting.  The dragon was great, strange given the lack in the special effects department overall.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Rented for 48hrs and got only 24h.<br />This is a rip off.<br />Want to get my money back . .
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I thought this book was excellent as popular history.  Engaging and easy to read with a lot of interesting detail without being excruciating.  A nice balance.  The case for the summer of 1927's place in U.S. history is well made.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Love it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book had a very clever plot and an amazing, satisfying finish. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I am a reader, not a writer. Sorry I cannot be more verbose just to meet your arbitrary review requirements!
B008J8KBKY|5.0|3D 4-in Row is a great game!  VERY Challenging and riveting game.<br /><br />I RECOMMEND THIS game to everyone looming for exciting challenge.  BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY! NOW.
B006ZJJ6XW|5.0|While the performances here range from average to outstanding, I give this 5 stars since it's inexpensive and allows you to pick up some really great recordings of Nos. 7-9 (1 and 2 are good too, but I listen to them much less). Speaking of Toscanini, as other reviewers here have, the 8th is very much in his mold, with similar tempos and high drama in the outer movements (why everyone refers to this as a \\"genial\\" symphony I'm not sure, at least not based on the outer movements). Dynamic, propulsive, dramatic, beautiful--outstanding. The 7th is the same, and seems to have been recorded even better, with fresh, open sound. After an exciting introduction to the first movement, Leinsdorf's development continues at a slightly more moderate pace, yet there is still a palpable sense of excitement in the playing. Unusually for the time, he takes the repeats in the final movement, and his finely judged tempos and phrasing throughout make this also a standout 7th. Leinsdorf handles the opening of the 4th symphony a bit oddly, rushing the lead-in to the movement proper, which for me doesn't work, though I recall the final movement as as being especially pleasing. The 3rd strikes me as possibly the dullest in this set.<br /><br />I'm not certain this new remastering is better than the previous releases, which had lustrous strings and good ambiance. These sound different, and probably no worse, but not necessarily better.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game could use an update. For starters, the facebook stuff does not work on my Kindle. Also, the app makes me exit it every so often.Except for that, the game is just AMAZING. It deserves it's rating. :)
1619698463|4.0|I agree with so much of it.  At times it got too technical and it seemed more geared to what physicians would understand as opposed to the general public.  Since I got the Kindle version, I need to go on his website to get the charts and lists now.
B00BMKH5NW|3.0|Fangirl is the story of Cath, an avid writer and fangirl of Simon Snow.  When she goes off to college and finds that her twin sister doesn't want to be roommates, she has trouble adjusting.<br /><br />I really liked this story because I feel like it's a realistic take on college.  A lot of the characters are flawed, and while you can dislike their actions, I found that I just couldn't dislike them.  Rowell shows that there's definitely a gray area and it's not fair to judge people so quickly, based off of their actions.<br /><br />Cath was a hard protagonist to handle because she was just so sad and lonely for most of the beginning of the book.  But as the story progressed she came out of her shell and became more relaxed.  Some of the scenes between Cath and her roommate Reagan were just too funny.  And Levi?  He's a love interest who's as complicated as love itself.  All in all a pretty enjoyable read.
B008J8KBKY|3.0|When it has came down to tablet video games, they haven't really been all that is worth the money. That is the case with so many takes on classic games like Ruzzle, the Boggle-themed puzzle game, and Candy Crush Saga, which is a take on Bejewled that is to the next generation. But other games could have been more for their money like 4 In A 3D Row. This is a take on the classic puzzle game Connect 4 that goes into 3D where you try to Connect 4 in a row through a intergalatic cube. The game is simply fine for beginners, but not overall anything worth raving about in you are playing it on your own. It is alright if you are playing it through Wi-Fi with others, but not really worth the money overall. If you really want to play a variation of Connect 4, you are better off playing it another way.<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Graphics: B-<br /><br />Sound: C+<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: C<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Eleanor and Park is an innocent love story between two teenagers in the 1980's.  There's Park, the quiet boy with a great interest in comics and music.  And Eleanor, who's main goal is to be invisible and just survive.  The 2 start out as seat-mates no the school bus and form a friendship that develops into more.  While the plot felt stilted at times, I loved the details.  The talk about music and 80's fashion, along with Park's hilarious parents really added to the story.  Rainbow Rowell has definitely become one of my \\"must read\\" authors.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Great acting! Great movie! This was a terrific movie in 1999 and still today in 2013! Truly a classic for all time
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I really hope that when I edit this review, having had time to listen to Artpop to write my own review, that I don't agree with this one (link below.). The review seems to acknowledge Gaga is a major star but then goes to liken some of the worst musical decisions ever made to Artpop, so not sure if she's a hater nor not.<br /><br />[...]
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Pales when compared to The Walking Dead TV show.  I like movies to be entertaining or informative.  This was just disorder and noise.  Was all the chaos ment to be a metaphor for life in the 21st Century?  FX good though.  I'll probably watch it again to see if my opinion changes.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Loved these when I was younger. Love reading them to my kids now. Very happy to find they love them and they are one of the few books that puts good and bad very squarely in their proper places. It may spell it outb a bit but that is intentional and beautifully done as only C.S. Lewis can.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|saved me so much storage I love this app everyone should get this app my kindle fire is usable again
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|With every new book released by John Grisham, I think, this is his best book yet, and Sycamore Row is no exception.
B006WMILQU|5.0|Well written!  Great acting..terrific performances, especially Frances O'Connor!<br />Another of Britains's great historical romances...the great divide between wealth and poverty....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You my never sleep with so much fun try to get to next world . I have my mother playing now she at 65.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a must-have app where Kindle Fire is concerned. I can't understand why the tablet doesn't come with something like this as standard. After all, information about the battery is essential, surely?
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Fun, fun fun with zombies. Brad Pitt was perfect for this role, I heard there were massive rewrites, in this case they worked. It had a grea spin on the zombie mythos (working together to achieve goals, watch the storming of the city walls in Israel), grim faced military, sadness, and a nice twist with those the horde thought was dead. There is so much zombie literature and film available, including some surprisingly good stuff (I read/watch this to entertain, not tax the brain, Clive Cussler performs the same role). &#34;Juan of the Dead&#34; (Mexico) and &#34;Rec 3&#34; (Spain) are recent discoveries with nice details and surprises. But I digress, I liked this so much I rented it twice. Don't tell my wife.......
0762434279|1.0|It's the smallest book Ive ever seen.  It's all just little notes.  Be sure not to buy this... you want the REAL book, not the &#34;miniature edition&#34;.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|It has very good acting (C'mon, Dicaprio), although Tobey Maguire did his usual excellent work (perhaps better than Dicaprio) and Joel Edgerton as Tom gave an excellent performance. Perhaps because it was written in the same era, the woman's parts seem rather thin. I love Carey Mulligan and Isla Fischer, but they were primarily foils, the roles did not seem to match the talent. The movie had the Baz Lurhman crispness and snap to the visuals, but dare I say It? Perhaps, just perhaps, the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald is getting a bit dated? It just doesn't seem to translate well, might just be me. By now, I've just seen the Gilded Age spoiled decadent American Royalty caught in their own lifestyle trap thing before.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was good to reconnect with the characters from A Time to Kill in this gripping read. Couldn't put it down.
B001EBV0NU|4.0|I had seen this movie several times before.  My ex hated it which was reason enough for me to like it.  Aside from that, I thought it was absolutely hysterical!  Ack Ack Ack - Pass the popcorn
B001HC8516|5.0|Best self-help book everrrr!!!! It's a book every woman, no matter the age or relationship status, should read. I'm a non believer of the self-help books, but this one kind of makes me change my mind. Helps you open your eyes on a lot of the lies we tell each other on every toxic relationship we ever had.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Its a great app for my kids, they love him and it keeps them occupied during the day when I have do some chores for the house.
B004TNGLW0|5.0|Is the best collector edition of a movie that I bought ever, and the price that has dropped is great.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was a great book! It was Such a great love story. I recommend  it to everyone! I couldn't put it down!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was well written, but such an unhappy story. Many discussion points for a book club.<br />Would recommend for a bookclub.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The city is a very realistic city virtual city playground is the best game I have ever played I am great at building the city
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Most games drive me insane because you have only so many tasks every hour and you need to leave to refill your life meter.  Ice Age lets you keep playing until life gets in the way...
B005H9B2CE|5.0|It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a film this much that I didn't see in the theatres. Everything from the score, to the effects, to the acting were really superb. I thought Tom Hiddleston (Loki) was fantastic and as an actor myself, was really drawn into his performance. (Hope he gets a Loki centered film in the future.) Chris Hemsworth was completely charming and believable as Thor and I found myself wishing Asgard was a real place I could go visit... ;-) Instantly, I could tell that this film was a cut above when I read the cast list and then was even more thrilled when I saw Kenneth Branagh as the director. I mean, really, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />Enjoy the film, get a bucket of popcorn and take the ride!
B0000524CY|5.0|I am an avid horror fan, this is a must have version for anyone that is serious about snuggling up with their girlfriend and watching and watching a good scare flick. LOL :)) This is a much better version than what was released in the theatre long ago.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another awesome book...Stephen King keep up the great work your books are the best as for as i am concerned .. Thanks
B00F3VOL38|3.0|This issue, along with the volume from 1994,(which is much richer material-wise) give us probably the best chance to hear what the lads were really like as a post-Hamburg, polished, huge act. One of the bad raps that the guys always got was they were a mediocre LIVE band. The BBC Sessions prove that they were just exactly what John and Paul said- \\"a good little r'n'r band that made it very, very big...J Lennon, 1969.<br /><br />As far as the actual PRODUCT REVIEW, the sound is well mixed, with the guitars very clean and separated properly. John's chunk-chonk rhythm and George's leads and fills equally distinguishable.  Ringo's drum kit, especially the oft-overlooked kick drum, are dangled in just the proper places, with hi-hat sharpness very edgy and up in the mix, as it should be. Ringo was the heartbeat of this monster, by the way. Of course, Paul's bass gets good treatment.<br /><br />So I agree with a fellow reviewer that the lack of new, unheard Beeb songs brings this a 3.5 star review. Obviously, the historical aspect is cool, and the most enjoyable parts are the witty banter between BBC DJ's Muff and Matthews and the band, and their early day shout outs to individual fans and party situations for fans. That would quickly end as this group went atomic, which is an analogy I give to watching the group at the Cavern Club in 1962, it would be like standing next to a nuclear explosion. There are no new versions of songs, but the performances do prove that the band was competent performing live, and that George could produce a guitar solo on the spot, which has been often disputed. Go get em Georgie, and Johnny and Ritchie and Paul-thanks for the music dudes. We Love You...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast works as advertised.  To dock it a star because they haven't expanded its streaming capabilities would be unjust. From my iPhone, my Galaxy S2, my Nexus 7, I can cast from YouTube & Netflix flawlessly.  So far, I feel the integration with the Android device is better since control exists from the lock screen vs on the iPhone.  This is a downer since I favor my iPhone, but it's a Google device, makes sense.  HuluPlus & Pandora have been added since I got the device, and I have yet to test either.<br /><br />I hope that it's deal with Hulu doesn't lock the device from other content providers.  I'd love to see the device offering more options.<br /><br />For what it is, and for it's cost, it's a neat device that I look forward to more content being available in the future.

B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Follow the instructions included... but what made a Smooth Cut for me were these:<br /><br />-Score the bottle (touch the blade of this cutter on the bottle) lightly.... if you press too hard, it will not cut smoothly<br />-pour the boiling water in the thinnest stream possible - I placed mine in a metal watering can with the very narrow spout, just because it was what I had available<br />-pour the boiling water on the bottle, with the least possible water touching it....<br /><br />The 4 stars is because it took several tries to figure out the system above.  Plus storing this is a bit awkward...  I wish it lay flat but because of the design, it has to be a bit bulkier...
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Anyone who likes music and humor this would be great for. My nieces love this movie!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a real wonder.  I am so sad it's over--I've grown rather attached to Auggie and his friends & family. I am actually unable to pull together words that can convey how provocative and profound this book is. It is honest and painful and joyful and truly...wonder-full.

B00DDQTKHM|5.0|We have been working to clarify our marketing strategy for the past few months. This book and David Scott's insights have helped us round out our social media strategy.

B00EW9GQR6|3.0|With conviction, I actually wanted to enjoy  and rate \\"Artpop\\" much higher.  My husband gifted me with tickets to a Lady Gaga concert on the Christmas Eve of 2010 and I liked both her Fame Monster and Born This Way cds.  Additionally, I can sense that she tried her musical best with song creations such as \\"Venus\\", \\"Do What U Want\\"  (feat. R. Kelly), and Dope.  She even bravely pours out her sensual side with such tunes as G.U.Y. and Sexx Dreams. The only reason why I reluctantly give it three stars is because I was hoping for the similar musical energy that birthed \\"Edge of Glory\\" and \\"You & I\\". However, many diehard fans of Lady Gaga a.k.a as her little monsters may enjoy \\"Artpop\\".
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very good game easier to play than the Facebook version.work's very well with my kindle.easy to follow along with progress.only negative is rewards needs to be bigger

B000PFUA9G|5.0|I've never bought a bad Brad Paisley album and this is a good one. He never disappoints his fans. He's a great talent.
B00ECK21WO|5.0|As others have said here, this set deserves all the superlatives it has received.  And, also echoing other reviews, if you don't own 1992's \\"The Great Deceiver\\" box set, nor any of the shows available for download, then this set, for Crimheads, is a huge slice of heaven.  But, even if you do have some of these shows, it's still heaven.<br /><br />My own history followed the path of, \\"...Court of the Crimson King\\", a fantastic record, pushing the \\"pop\\" music envelope into \\"progressive\\" realms, but disappointed in subsequent releases.  Then, becoming a huge Robin Trower fan with his first solo album, \\"Twice Removed From Yesterday\\", and attending the King Crimson June 22, 1974 show in Milwaukee - with Trower opening.  I was pinned to my seat during Crim's set, and fell in love with \\"Red\\" when it was released.<br /><br />I was more than excited to see that the Milwaukee show which I attended was included in this set, but was totally unprepared, in leafing through the included booklet, on page 10, to see my own ticket stub from the June 22 show printed.  Wow.  My ticket stub - immortalized!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I like this type of music, I got hooked watching the video, but find I really like it!  First CD I reach for now when I want to listen to something.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I'm getting less and less enthralled with the Pendergast series. Which essentially means I'm less enthralled with Pendergast himself. This is the third, and what I assume, final, book in the Helen trilogy.<br /><br />\\"Two Graves\\" is in many ways three different stories. One story follows Pendergast and D'Agosta as they investigate harrowing murders in several NYC hotels. This then shifts to South America after a rather big reveal--which I won't divulge here. But the events in South America involve only Pendergast (and other, new characters) and not D'Agosta, who once again seems to be put on the sideline for much of the book (as does Laura Hayward).<br /><br />The second story involves Corrie Swanson, a character first introduced back in \\"Still Life With Crows.\\" This story line has little to do with the overall plot and I found it rather mundane and pointless. Which is disappointing because I loved the character and her interactions with Pendergast in the aforementioned book.<br /><br />Finally, we follow Dr. Felder as he investigates Constance Green's past. As with the Corrie plot, there's not a lot of reason for this to be a part of the main book. If Preston/Child want to explore these characters further, maybe they should do so in stand-alone novels and not wrap them up in a Pendergast novel. The characters are obviously tied to Pendergast, but here, there's little to no interaction with him, so what's the point?<br /><br />Not long after the big reveal, Pendergast goes into a major free fall; this is the most interesting part of the story for me. The special agent is always in control so to see him lose it so was quite interesting.<br /><br />Preston and Child's knack for weaving a perceived supernatural thriller, with Pendergast and D'Agosta hot on the trail, has lost a great deal of steam over the last several books. I'm hoping they can find their stride again because I'm losing patience and faith in this series.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This is a great movie, nice and neutral - which can be hard to find.  So many movies now a days are geared just for boys or girls - not really trying to create a wonderful story.  This is a great story (though not realistic at all).
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|I could not put this book down. The characters seemed so real and the plot so complex. Reading this book is as addictive as the laudanum used so often by the main characters.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Let me bottom-line this for you.  This must is a MUST SEE AND A MUST OWN FOR ANY BLU-RAY or movie collection.  Movie buffs will put this movie in heavy rotation.  The best movie I've seen in 2013 by far.  Read on to get the details of why I love this movie.<br /><br />This movie scores a perfect 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10. It doesn't matter what scale you're using.  I'm one of the toughest movie critics I know and my friends often discount my movie reviews because I'm constantly giving movies low scores (and deservedly so).  I couldn't find a fault with this movie even when I tried. It's the perfect blend of action and story line and plot.  Zach Snyder does a great job with this reboot of giving viewers the best view of what Kryton looks like and how it was before the planet blew up.  Just to give you measure of my movie rating scale, I rate Bourne Ultimatum & The Shawshank Redemption 10 out of 10.<br /><br /> Henry Cavill is an excellent actor and play the perfect superman in this movie.  His depiction of Clark Kent/Superman rivals what Christian Bale did for the reboot of the Dark Knight trilogy.  He really bulked up from when I last remember him in 300 where he had more of a cut-up build.  He lends real credibility to Clark Kents vulnerable insecure side to his powers living amount humans and you can see the confidence builds as he finds himself as Superman.<br /><br />The entire flow of the movie is excellent from start to finish. There's no boring moments or lags in this movie.  I love how they really showed Kryton in this movie and how the planet looked and how the society was.  Michael Shannon plays a great villain in General Zod in the movie. The acting doesn't get much better than this.  Amy Adams playing Lois Lane was the only weak link in the acting dept but she played the role just okay.  The action in this movie is some of the best done action fight sequences I've seen.  They really did some original fighting scenes that took you on view points that viewers hand't seen before.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its good.<br />I like it.<br />it can be a time higher though.  be careful if you're prone to seductions.  seriously

B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I've read other works by Eggars before, and greatly enjoyed them, so I imagined this novel would be equally satisfying. Boy was I mistaken. Flat, unlikable characters who are are quickly seduced by this penopticon-like company that channels Google and Facebook and all other social media into one. All but 4 characters are wildly disillusioned. What? Most of society willingly agrees to have every inch of their lives videotaped and archived forever? Come on. If Eggars wants to write a commentary on the way social media is taking over our lives (and I'm not saying it isn't), write an essay, an article, anything. This parable of a novel was a waste of my time.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I'm glad to have stumbled across these puzzles.They are quite fun. The trouble is that I can't stop til I've solved them all and now there are no more.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Steamy and sexy can not wait for the next one is always the hardest part. Love the authors creativity and not letting it be just another romance novel
B000002KOJ|5.0|Listening to Clouds for the first time in decades is a chance to rediscover what the world saw.  She was only 25 when these tunes were written and recorded.  She already showed a lyrical and harmonic instinct that no other songwriter had at the time.  &#34;Both Sides Now,&#34; &#34;Songs To Aging Children Come,&#34; &#34;Chelsea Morning,&#34; &#34;Roses Blue&#34; and &#34;The Gallery&#34; all came from this album.  They are all masterpieces, and they hold up well.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really need this. I always lose my alarm clock, but never my kindle.... so hey! Thats really nice. Cool. Yeah.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|It's beautifully written, very original, provokes thought.<br />A beautiful book which draws a deep, general and personal picture of the times.<br />It is relevant to every human being
B00D6QUJ6U|1.0|Don't waste ur money on this Blu-ray disc. The sound and the picture is very bad. I own a DVD disc and it's sounds much better than the Blu-ray and better picture.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. It has lots of fun and exciting challenges. Great noise effects and keeps my little ones entertained enough to lure the older one in to wanting to play it also.
B0094737HI|5.0|The Excuses for Travellers was my favorite post-Slowdive album of Neil Halstead's projects, but I think this album really rivals that in terms of quality.  Definitely one of my favorite buys this year.  And, check out the new Black Hearted Brother!  His new project goes back to 90s shoegaze/space rock.  Reminds me of Spiritualized, but with more of a jam quality instead of orchestrated.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Okay, you are half asleep and shouldn't even be on the road; pop in this cd and like strong coffee you are immediately confronted with GaGa committing murder and hiding the body (sounds like she killed her farmer but what would she be doing on a farm so maybe it was her father??) ..turns into a way wild rift and then there's a little whiskey in the brew as she suggestively sings, \\" Do you want to see me naked?\\" I'm down with that! For anybody complaining that the CD contains too much sexual proclivities please do me one favor: consider the sexy source of all this sound!!  Besides which it's not just pure filth (not that there's anything wrong with that)..you just have to dig deeper to catch the many layers of meaning.  GaGa is many things but NEVER one dimensional and this cd is NO EXCEPTION TO THE RULE!!  WARNING:  For anyone who hates when a review brings in something else for comparison get ready; this one will.  I just bought Bangerz the other day and GaGa is to Miley what solid gold cigarette lighters are to Motel Six matches.  Miley tries too hard and it shows!  GAGA DOES NOT HAVE TO TRY; I HAVE EVEN CAUGHT MADONNA IMITATING HER!  DOPE'S A GREAT SONG, LOVE IT G.U.Y.TOO!  Going by some reviews I had previewed I was prepared to hate Jewels and Drugs so maybe because my expectations were so low it was pretty good.  LOVE SEXX DREAMS.  While it's possible not one of the songs is as good as Bad Romance hey why mess with perfection!  NONE THE LESS THIS CD SIZZLES AND GAGA HAS THE PIPES AND THE POWER TO PULL THIS OFF!  I LOVE YOU LADY GAGA .. STAY HOT!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This grown-up soap opera unfolds with wonderful characters and historical authenticity. I thought this was the saddest season, so far, and was sorry to say goodbye to some key players. Can't wait for Season 4!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|This is a great way too kill time and zombies. I also recommend samurai vs zombies 2. Being able too play as the zombies is a fun twist.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again Jake Briggance is pulled into a trial where race appears to be a factor.  In true \\"Grisham\\" style he leads us through the personal lives of people who we can \\"admire, pity, love, or hate\\".
B00571F26Y|4.0|Good food for thought. Good information. Some was redundant. I felt he could have sent his message with less dialog. The medical verbiage had no value to me since I did not understand it. I must not have any sensitivity to wheat. I felt no change in my wellness and all the improvements he suggests, when I gave wheat up. I did not lose the weight he promised. I may have lost 4 or 5 pounds. To be fair, however, I eat very little bread, cereal, or pasta and nearly zero processed foods that wheat would be in. It seems to be the same as Dr. Atkins theory, watching your carbohydrate intake plus elimination of wheat products. I find it a difficult regiment to follow with all the business lunch meetings I have, where pizza or submarine sandwiches are the norm.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|My wife loves this band and i got her for stocking and she loved every song.<br />listens to it on her mp3 player all the time
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|I really liked this season, however it was confusing at first. Season 3 was slow, this season is a good change of pace.
0399157573|4.0|Once again we are swept away on a terrific forensic ride.  Apt descriptions of medical procedures are written in such a way anyone can understand.  The descriptions of outdoor scenes and \\"Lucy's Toys\\" are just great.<br />When she talks about Benson you know the depth of their relationship.  Marino (my favorite character) is the same old same old.  Dorothy and her mother will never change and that's okay.<br />They add a believable touch to the story.  Not everyone gets along with their family all the time.  GOOD READ!!!!!  I read it in two days I couldn't put it down.
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|'Tis said that the worst sin committed by any movie reviewer is to describe the movie that he or she would have made instead.  How-some-ever, I can think of no better way to critique Mark Cousins' intriguing \\"The Story of Film: An Odyssey\\" than by dragging him to the woodshed to teach the teacher a leson.  \\"Intriguing\\" because Cousins comes tantalizingly close to getting it right, but the misses are so woefully wide the mark as to put most viewers off...which is a tragedy because his insights are mostly so precise and so illuminating as to explain the very core of why the world is forever in the thrall of the medium (the cliche of \\"the stuff dreams are made of\\" to the contrary notwithstanding).<br /><br />So, first off, the music has to go.  It is loudly percussive and serves no other purpose than to annoy the viewer.<br /><br />Second, Cousins apparently dragged some talentless cinematographer around the world with him to film the historical locations to illustrate that which he's talking about.  These consist mostly of street scenes shot Andy Warhol-style with no apparent regard for content.  The shots are badly framed (wide-angle shots are best composed with the camera level and not pointed at the sky unless there's a plane up there that we're supposed to notice) and consist of little more than contemporary traffic whizzing by in the foreground...which makes no sense when Cousins is describing a 19th century film.  The only present-day shots that make any sense are those of filmmakers whom Cousins is interviewing.  That is, if no footage of \\"The Battleship Potemkin\\" is available, I would a lot rather see a 1925 postcard than a desultory steet scene of today's Odessa.<br /><br />Thirdly, I wish the supers would identify not only the movies they are imposed upon, but whetever else might be in the background (personalities, studios, equipment, memorabilia, posters, scenery).  Photoplays themselves may not be enhanced by explanations, but a \\"course\\" in film history can only benefit from a surfeit of pertinent information.<br /><br />Finally, Cousins has tried to stuff his arbitrary divisions of film history into a Procrustian bed of 15 more-or-less decades of different schemata (such as the unwieldy \\"Japanese Classicism and Hollywood Romance, 1928-1945\\") which are about as comfortable as a left shoe on a right foot.  If I were Cousins, I would have divided movie history into more universally recognized themes (chapters on \\"Film Noir,\\" \\"Westerns,\\" \\"Science Fiction,\\" \\"Romance,\\" \\"Buddy Films,\\" \\"Musicals,\\" \\"Mysteries,\\" \\"War Movies,\\" \\"Comedies,\\" \\"Costume Dramas,\\" etc.).  But, alas, Cousins seems to have lost my number.<br /><br />I would normally have written off such a lumpy effort with two or three stars, but I think \\"The Story of Film\\" deserves four stars...and not just for his effort (which is epic in its scope).  Cousins utters some of the most interesting things I have ever heard about individual directors and individual films (he seems to have little use for process or technique; he describes most shots where the camera moves as \\"tracking\\" shots, whether or not it is a pan, arm, tilt, crane or steadicam).  Definitely worth a look-see.  If you don't want to commit to the fancy boxed edition, the whole shebang is currently available on Netflix.  (And then there's Cousins' book of the same name available from Amazon - advt.)<br /><br />Some commentators have disapproved of Cousins' lilting Irish accent (and the fact that he often talks over the dialog of the shot he's describing), but I find his voice charming and natural.  If he taught a course at USC or UCLA, I would be there in a heartbeat.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Really good hardcore show! I love the fact that with Amazon Prime you can go back and watch all of these shows!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This seemed to be the most unbiased and best explained description of a near death experience that I have read. It was fascinating, understandable, and inspiring. Although no one should rush to die, I can't imagine why anyone would fear the afterlife after reading this book.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is wisdoms, history, modern day politics, and lessons of humanity all in one. It is a work of nothing short of genius. I only hope George Martin finishes his epic vision and do not pull a &#34;Puccini&#34; or &#34;Dickens&#34; on us and leave  us short of his own vision of how this masterpiece will end
B00FMFEA68|3.0|Have to say that I enjoyed this and I do think Morrissey is a fantastic lyricist. First half is good, very evocative, I found the second half descended into an extended score settling rant reminiscent of Father Teds awards acceptance. No matter how much success comes his way theres always somebody doing him wrong, some very petty swipes that detract from my opinion of him as a person but not as an artist. Writing is very good though as you would expect. Shame he couldn't contain his ire a little
0399157573|5.0|Dr. Kay Scarpetta battles demons - current, past and potential future ones - in Dust, Patricia Cornwell's latest novel in the \\"Scarpetta\\" series.<br /><br /> Fresh from the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre, a scene of unimaginable horror that Scarpetta saw first-hand and the lingering nightmare that not only weakens her in body but also in spirit, Scarpetta is thrust into the deranged delusions of a serial killer.<br /><br /> The combination of the two, as well as Det. Pete Marino's abrupt change of jobs, cause Scarpetta to remember what brought her group - Marino, her FBI criminal profiler-husband Benton Wesley, her niece Lucy and herself - together initially.<br /><br /> Interwoven with the present and the past are Scarpetta's fears for everyone's futures, even as she attempts to stop the serial killer dubbed \\"the Capital Murderer.\\"<br /><br /> Cornwell includes necessary facts to enhance the story and enable Scarpetta to catch this killer.  Cornwell, who does exhaustive research for all of her work, doesn't overwhelm the reader when including procedures, nor does she do it gratuitously as if to say, \\"Look how serious a writer I am.\\"<br /><br /> Rather, Cornwell's research adds to the novel so that the reader's interest is never lost.  She also adds humor, whether it's Marino trying (and failing) to train his new puppy or Benton working a crime scene in greatly-oversized orange boots and an expensive, understated dark gray suit.<br /><br /> Cornwell paints with a careful brush, pacing the narrative so the reader doesn't guess the identity of the killer until the characters learn it for themselves.<br /><br /> However dysfunctional the Scarpetta \\"family\\" of characters may be, Dust is - for all the real horror of Newtown and the intriguing but fictional horror of a serial killer - a comfortable read that does not disappoint.
B00G32OER4|4.0|It was good without a lot of flashy effects.  Although I am not sure about how true the story followed actual events or how honest the Warrens are, it was still a good movie.  I was disappointed about the lack of distinction between Satanists and witches, but I guess it makes for a good story.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this novel & I picked at random<br />Fascinating subject matter<br />Great character definition.  Once I became invested in the characters I could not stop reading.  I  am one of those readers who &#34;figures  it out&#34; before the end of the book.  I did not in this case.  I kept thinking he would make a different decision in the end.  I wanted him to , yet still supported his right to chose.  I think Ms Moyes achieved her goal?  I am a fan of Jodi Picoult.  Now I am a fan of the British version

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really liked the book!  I felt the experiments were simple and result oriented.  This is definitely something you could share with friends and should go through a second, third, fourth time!
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Really a great family show which makes you feel good. This show is one of the best of this series.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|The game itself is amazing. Would be 5 stars if they weren't trying so hard to make money. You almost have to pay just to play if you want to play a lot. You would think with the overkill of ads they're already making enough.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an introvert, I found this book to be encouraging.  It was good to hear someone assert that there are many good qualities that are to be valued in having an introverted personality, and that being introverted doesn't necessarily mean that you are shy.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|My son received these movies for Christmas and he absolutely loved them, it was a great find and buy on our part
B00BWQW73E|4.0|All I knew about the inner machinations of Amazon was what I'd read in Mike Daisy's 21 DOG YEARS, a hilarious account of his time in (early) Amazon's customer service.  This book is of course more in-depth, but I found myself left with not so much admiration of Bezos as terror.  In the mold of seemingly every other techno-geek entrepreneur (Gates, Jobs, Ellison) he is a driven visionary who treats nearly everyone else like cr*p.  It's almost as if each one of these CEOs suffers from Aspergers.  When I read about workers in a \\"fulfillment center\\" having an ambulance stationed outside to revive them from the 100 degree heat INDOORS; Bezo's ruthless quashing of his competitors; his willingness to sell product at ZERO just to screw another foe; I don't experience that Randian glow at another mega-capitalist:  rather, disgust.  Jeff, you don't have to sell everything ever made.  In an attempt to be the Web's Wal-Mart, he has adopted their anti-human labor practices.  Hey, I like Kindle and Amazon's self-publishing, but I also like to see authors making some money from their labors.  Bezo's laugh is like a great white rolling its eyes before it consumes its prey.  Scary.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|I adore these movies, they are great. The second movie in this series, Evolution, is fantastic. Highly highly recommended. I just love the plot and Kate Beckinsale kicks serious butt in these movies. Not just your ordinary vampire movie... these are some of the original of this generation of movie-making and they are truly entertaining.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I love this movie, cher is wonderful and inspiring to me. I love the music and dance. The love scenes are interesting
B000R9J3XE|5.0|If you like Garbage, this is a must-have cd. It has all their best music. I have to say, Garbage still has it going on. Just saw them in concert. Shirley Manson looks amazing and is still rocking. Such a fun cd. Its great to play this and listen to all those great old Garbage songs. Highly recommended.

B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love this book.  No wonder why it was good no great enough to be a long show.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is a murder mystery fan.  This book is shocking, interesting, and a lot of love.
B00F5BON8O|4.0|Sarah's distinctive voice is as remarkable as ever. The song choices in this collection aren't quite as interesting as they have been in earlier releases.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game for adsults and kids it is do fun for everybody you should get it now
B0034DGPEU|5.0|wonderful book not only about slavery but the slavery of women at that time.  I loved the way it was told by 2 different characters and how their growth was shown for each point of view.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book.  It got kind of confusing  when it switched from story to story.  Bleak ending. But otherwise I would recommend this book to anybody who likes wars or ZOMBIES.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|awesome collector's edition fancy tin case. superman returns was boring. man of steel was epic. i am ready for mos 2!
B000002GFC|1.0|The CD itself looks fine but the recordings have several skips in them, affecting several songs.  Very disappointed. I'll download from now on.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|The Timers4Me & Stopwatch Pro was a free app of the day and it has turned out to be a great countdown calendar as well. Retirement is just around the corner and it's so awesome to watch the exact time, down to the second, that's left before that magic time in our lives!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Is great to be considerate of the time I have to read the rest of their life and I am exhausted and I am lucky enough to be considerate of the time it takes the time it is not sure yet
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Love Pendergast.  Fast paced story and non stop adventure.  Can't wait to read the next one.  It is another rollercoaster ride.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Like the title says, season has been a &#34;game changer&#34;...great to see her out of her comfort zone ...can't wait for new episodes each week
1455525839|5.0|FBI Special Agent Pendergast is back, and I'm glad! I was disappointed in the last couple of Pendergast books. They seemed to \\"all over the place\\", and Pendergast was painted with a comic book super hero paintbrush.<br /><br />White Fire is a masterfully constructed tale with all the action, tight squeezes, and plot twists that you expect from Mr. Preston and Mr. Child. Much of the story takes place from the point of view of Corrie Swanson, Pendergast's young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, who is working on a thesis project. She gets a few helpful pokes from Pendergast, but moves most of the action on her own. The characterization of Pendergast has a real modern-day Sherlock Holmes feel to it. He has always had that type of appeal to me, but the last few books have had him able to get out of binds with nearly superhuman strength and abilities. He still has one of those moments in White Fire, but most of the time he is merely a supremely intelligent, totally dominant, impeccably dressed, FBI Special Agent.<br /><br />Preston and Child have written a tightly constructed, very entertaining book that even gives you a \\"long-lost\\" Sherlock Holmes story in the middle. There is a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde connection in the prologue of the book, which continues to pop up though out the story. They have given us a very enjoyable book connecting the true story from 1889 to the fictional novel set in 2013.<br /><br />I give this book 5 Stars out of 5 and a Big Thumbs Up! If you like a good, action thriller, and have a fondness for Sherlock Holmes, then you will love White Fire.<br /><br />I received this Digital Review Copy for free from NetGalley.com.
B005HED11Y|4.0|I enjoyed it, but I had forgotten how silly it was at times.  I hadn't seen it since it was new on TV.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|Blackfish is not only a compelling, well-crafted documentary, it is a film that could spark the beginning of the end to a brutal animal amusement industry. Along with the film, \\"The Cove\\", Blackfish is an unflinching examination of an industry that captures, torments, confines and even kills some of the most sensitive, intelligent beings on earth. Any one with a shred of compassion who watches this film will immediately understand that SeaWorld and other marine parks must cease to exist.
B000006MS3|3.0|I've been slowly getting into The Dreaming after having heard it a few times. Like most of her albums, there are hits and misses, but it seems as though the \\"hits\\" are so good that they consume my brain and I have to play them on repeat several times a day. For this album, \\"Suspended in Gaffa\\" is especially excellent, as is \\"Night of the Swallow\\"; the latter being one of the most interesting songs I've heard in a while. It's so dramatic and her voice is just all over the place (in a good way).
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I don't buy many LOA books these days cause they all seem to rehash the same old thing. However, this one piqued my curiosity. I haven't had time to do all of the experiments in here but I did two and actually received answers pretty quick! For the record I've already been convinced of the LOA by things that have happened previously but the experiments are fun.<br /><br />I love the stories and the personal experiences. I will definitely read this again for inspiration. In fact, that is my favorite part of this text - the uplifting, cheerful treatment of the subject. This isn't a 'use this to get rich' book, this book says 'you're okay, so relax!' Such a good feeling!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|OMG! This was pure torture reading. I don't know how I even finished it- oh that's right I had to resort to speed reading and scanning. How do you start with an amazing book then end up with this crap. If you want to waste several hours of your life then read this. This was boring, boring, boring. I'm officially noting 2013 as the year of crap novels.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|One of the best TV shows ever, despite its short stay. The cast is great and the episodes are a nice mix of drama, humor, and action.
B00CT2P6VA|1.0|I own the other Quell games and love them, so I was excited to get this one. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play it because it WON'T LET ME. Every time I open it to start playing, it kicks me out after one or two levels at most. I've done the uninstall/reinstall thing four times now, and each time I have the same problem. I'm highly disappointed, especially because this Quell game costed twice as much as the others. Buy at your own risk.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it! I have this app on my phone and kindle fire. I love all the different versions it has and how fast the app works.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Oh WOW!  Really loved every bit of it! Couldn't put it down. Great ending. But honestly, I would still love to read more. I laughed and cried with every character. I will miss reading this series!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\\" don't waste your time.  This is synonamous with \\"...Playbook.,\\" only with more mature main characters.  I made the mistake of reading these 2 books within the same weekend and am tired of the melancholy, mental-illlness addled take on life through a book.  If it's been a while since you've read or seen either (as movies), then you might enjoy \\"Playbook.\\"<br /><br />Pat is locked away for some amount of time in a \\"bad place.\\"  Long enough so that major life events take place in his family members lives, and his precious Eagles make it to the play-offs without him knowing anything about it.  He meets a girl who is just as socially mal adjusted as he;  this leads to a relationship which may or may not develop into a meaningful relationship (no spoilers here!).  The reader is introduced to Pat's therapist, his family, and friends.  Pat is held back by an event from his past life which placed him in a mental institution.  The reader is not told the event which has shaped Pat's life into its present state until the end of the book. We see Pat struggle to maintain daily living and manage social situations without losing his cool.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading this book, don't let my review deter you from an engrossing book.  I'm just jaded from reading the afore mentioned novel so closely to this one.  I have read in some reviews that this novel is actually better as a movie;  strange, I know, but it seems so.  I wish I had spent the time watching the movie instead.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It's really fun I didn't actually think I would enjoy it this much it does however need to give some free stuff
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|....and I've read over 2,000 books in my forty or so years.  If you think you've read every combination of words put together to form a story and/or plot, then this is the book for you.  Especially, if you've wondered if some of the choices you've made in your life were the right ones, this book is for you.  Even if you're perfectly content with your life and the choices you've made, do not miss this novel!  I have given only 2 5-star ratings out of 80 reviews on Amazon;  so, PLEASE, read this book.  I DID NOT receive a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.  I just thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Step into the lives of 3 women at different stages of their lives.  What starts out as 3 different story lines becomes inter-connected as the novel rolls along.  A long-held secret comes to light by way of the Berlin Wall.  Follow these 3 women as you watch the tentacles of the secret unfurl to touch each of their lives in unexpected ways.  Be ready to feel a roller-coaster of emotions while reading this, from laughing out loud to literally crying.  Remind yourself occasionally:  \\"This is just a book, this is just a book...\\"<br /><br />Don't miss this excellent novel.  I'm not familiar with the author, so I don't know how her other books compare.  I only know that THIS is one you shouldn't miss.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three of the books are amazing. I couldn't put them down. I read each book in a week. While working full time, going to school, and getting homework done. They are amazing. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Very Good Movie! A nice twist from the norm of slow walking zombies . Would refer movie to anyone who likes apocalyptic movies.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Fave show I really like this season it is very good and suspenseful hope it doesnt end anytime soon look forward to sunday night
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I enjoy the strategic part of the game however it's unnecessarily time consuming.  Acquiring gold stares should be easier. Sometimes the program seems a little glitchy
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ok, there are a few changes & add-in in the movies... e.g. Darth Vader's NOOOOOOOOO at the end of ROTJ! I kinda like that... haha..<br /><br />Anyways, i love all 6 movies.. that's right... all 6! Seeing it on blu-ray, it is just amazing, a cinematic feel! Every scene looked beautiful! The details are amazing.. the bonus features is one of my favorite parts... so many never-seen-before footages, LOVED IT!<br /><br />I still have all 6 movies on DVDs!!! I am gonna keep it close with my new BLU-RAY set! :)<br /><br />A MUST-BUY!!!<br /><br />The FORCE is with is blu-ray set!<br /><br />MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU... ALWAYS... :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|.I love this game! I could play it all day!You can get lots of ponies,and make huge villages!IT SOO AWESOME!
B00FWAZ87I|3.0|If this had been my first Ayreon I might have rated it higher, but it sounds too much like earlier Ayreon efforts with a lot of filler and recycled themes. Story is a bit predictable and trite, and told as too much of a narrative, not enough metaphor and abstraction. Arjen should try a bit more to break out of his groove/rut. While it was great to hear some of the old masters and new ones, as well, their talents are largely wasted here.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Lady Gaga is the best. I love ARTPOP so much. Can't stop it. Thank you for the album ARTPOP Gaga! X
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Fantastic vocals, well done albums. Songs all good which is rare for an album! Dont have a favorite yet, toss up between Swine and Dope.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great inspirational movie. I loved everything about from beginning to end. I would recommend this to everyone. Denzel was amazing like always.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Intelligently written with good story line. Brandon Sanderson has proved his abilities in this book. I would recommend this book.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I love the scenery. It is beautiful. I just started playing and enjoy the challenges. Good job on this game.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|Humorous and yet a great spoof on the horror films plot.  Not bad as a good example of an incident viewed through two different circumstances and how our preconceived ideas can over-ride common sense.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Interesting premise that keeps you guessing.  It's another Sanderson winner with a heroine that has a special gift, used in a very interesting twist.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|This is one of the most uneven albums I have ever listened to.  It contains some of the best of Gaga and certainly her worst.  The fact that I couldn't make my way from beginning to end without taking a break is disappointing.  It isn't all bad, however.  \\"Applause\\" is as nearly perfect.  \\"Fashion!,\\" \\"Gypsy,\\" and \\"Aura\\" are all outstanding.  \\"Dope\\" is a little rough around the edges lyrically, but also worth listening to.  \\"Do What You Want With My Body\\" is a little odd, considering we know what R. Kelly wants to do.  Let's just say, you may want to put some plastic down.<br /><br />Now, to the bad.<br /><br />I don't see the antichrist credited as producer anywhere, but the album contains a couple of songs that I imagine were created somewhere within the 6th circle of Hell.  Now, I have never been waterboarded, but I tell you that there is nothing I wouldn't do to stop having to listen to an endless loop of \\"Mary Jane Holland\\" and \\"Jewels N' Drugs.\\"  Given the uneven quality of the music, it's hard to rate the album as a whole.  \\"Applause\\" is certainly worthy of 5 stars.  So, I'll average the 5-star quality of the songs I mentioned at the beginning of my review with the -150,000,000 stars of the two latter songs and settle upon an overall rating of 3 stars.  If you're looking for a 5-star album, either buy the singles or scratch the living daylights out of the center of the cd.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Asha is left at an orphanage in Mumbai, India, by her mother who fears her husband will murder their daughter shortly after her birth. She  is  providentially adopted by a couple living in California. Her adopted father is from India, and her adopted mother is a California native. The story is told in the third person, present tense. It juxtaposes the California upbringing of Asha and the struggles of her birth family in India. When Asha travels to India for the first time at age 20 to visit her father's family, she sets out to discover her roots. There are misunderstandings and conflicts with her adopted mother that Asha needs to resolve. The reader is tugged along in anticipation of Asha's discovering her birth family and they, her, as the story of her birth mother's undying love and yearning is woven with Asha's yearning for the truth of her origin. The book ends with Asha's discovery of her roots, and realization that she was more treasured than she suspected. The author seems thoroughly familiar with life and customs of both India and America, giving the reader a glimpse into the complicated society and traditions of India, in particular. I enjoyed reading this book, having traveled to India, and related to seeing it through the eyes of Asha and her American mother.
B009APMNB0|5.0|I've previously used the now obsolete [[ASIN:B000ES6K4I ColorVision Spyder2PRO Win/Mac]], and I have to say color calibration has come a long way. The ColorMunki is so much easier to use. Unlike the Spyder2Pro, I did not need to go into my monitor's settings and manually adjust the color. The included software did all the work. All I did was plug the Munki into a USB port, hang it on my monitor when instructed by the software to do so, and wait patiently while the software did all the heavy lifting. Done!<br /><br />My one tip is to use a piece of scotch tape to hold the Munki tight against the monitor (be sure not to damage your monitor, test the stickiness of the tape first.)<br /><br />This is a great entry level option that will get your monitor calibrated and looking great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome addictive game. You'll get lost in time and realize you're late if you don't pay attention, cause you'll get sucked in.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It is an awesome book, can't wait for the movie. It was quite different than the usual story of Germany during that time.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Needs to have Amazon Prime as a benefactor. Works well with YouTube but needs other avenues of programming in order to really be useful!
B005MHI0QM|4.0|It is the second time I have read this story. The first time was when I was a young girl in school.  I still loved it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it its so fun but you only get a small amount of money but it's the beast game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Insanity, need I say more? You will get stuck, you will pull out your hair, you will wish you had never heard of the game, then you will want to play again.
1451648537|5.0|Love this book. Tells the story of a man who has made his impact on the world many times. I find myself referencing an anecdote from his life story very often.
B00DJYJPLO|1.0|I liked the first films in this franchise but disliked this one so much my teeth started grating.  It bounces between trite and pretentious.  It has the worst example of the overused &#34;beautiful people having a great meal outside in a rustic shabby genteel European setting&#34; I have ever seen full of witticisms and observations that might amuse a sophomore on pot.
B001P36OY2|3.0|I'm a big Vin Diesel fan but this film was only OK when compared to his Riddick series. The real downside was the HD video quality. Very poor!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Really liked this biography.  Thought it was well written and gave a very informative and real accounting of Steve Jobs life.  I found myself alternately admiring him and then really disliking him.  I own an iPad and love everything about it.  Now I know why.  Thank you Steve.
B00FLNRN06|4.0|Funny, crude humor at its best!  If you don't care for bawdy comedy, this movie probably isn't for you. It does have some heartfelt moments and a good ending, but dirty nonetheless.
B0063GORYU|3.0|its an okay app.  A little too easy to win game.  I prefer a little more of a challenge  there are better card apps out there
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put any if these books down! They shock and amaze at all corners of my imagination. They will not disappoint.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very good weather app.  You can easily check the forecast for the week as well as the daily forecast.  Weather radar and<br />videos are brought up with the touch of a finger.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I am very impressed with Gaga's new album! Just when you think she has done a phenomenal job, she then again exceeds our expectations. It is a very well put together album with phenomenal dance/pop tracks and a ballad that accompany an amazing new sound compared to her previous albums. She can never do her fans wrong and her music proves it every time! Even though I love the whole album these are my favorite tracks: Aura, Venus, G.U.Y., Sexxx dreams,  Do What U Want, Dope, and Applause.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I check it every day.  Easy way to keep up on family and friends.  Love to see my friends and families photos.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great great book, don't wanna get into spoilers but how the story is constructed is marvelous. I felt in love with Sam, while Patrick and Charlie were my buddies , by the end of the book you will understand a lot of things but at the same time makes the story deeper. It is not teenager literature but it is crearly inspired by that commmon place that we all visited some time ago.... Kudos!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Amazing follow up to Revelator.  Susan Tedeschi has to be considered one of the greatest blues voices ever.  Paired with the great guitar work from Derek Trucks and a band second to none makes this a special blues record like no other.  Definitely one of the top 3 best albums of 2013 in a surprisingly crowded field.  They should win yet another Grammy for this one.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was very well written and kept me interested throughout. Wonderful story with precise detail. It's not juvenile like Twilight but still kept the witch and vampire theme that is so popular right now. Buying the second book immediately!!
B00FI7XBIS|2.0|I downloaded this because it was free and it was close to Halloween but I'm really not into games and plan to delete it.
0399226907|5.0|I used to read this book as a child and loved it. So it is easy to see why I would want to by this for my 3 year old! This has to be one of his favorite books and wants to read it with me several times a day. It is very sturdy and just as I remembered. I would recommend this for anyone that wants a fun book to read with!
B00GFJ0NGQ|3.0|Season 4 has been the weakest season so far. The Walking dead always had its share of plotholes and inconsistencies but season 4 has been particularly bad in that regard. Even the actors admitted that the writing was weak in some interview that I read. The problem is that the new showrunner has no experience running shows. I am still attached to the main characters and will therefore keep watching season 4, hoping that things will improve as the season progresses.
0805047905|5.0|This was exactly what I thought it was, came fast and arrived on time! This was the same book I read as a kid, and now that my son is 3 he loves it just as much as me! We love sharing this book! I would recommend this to anyone! ( I bought the card board version so it didn't get ruined )
B002LMV7TS|5.0|The Grinch is one of my VERY favorite Christmas books.  It is so much fun to read.  This video is so colorful and could become a December tradition in your home.  Jim Carry is a terrific grinch!
B000002PCS|5.0|Somewhere in Time is a favorite of mine, and I was thrilled to find this CD.  This movie was a favorite of mine and I was pleased to find the original motion picture soundtrack.  I definitely recommend this CD.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I looked at several and this one seemed the easiest to use.  It has useful features other than the time. It's a winner.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this solitaire game, but after playing Spider Solitaire, it is not enough of a challenge.  I would recommend this app.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Great ideas about how food affects our body helped me think through the foods I eat, what I should eat and what I shouldn't eat and how it affects your whole body.
0525478817|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I didn't particularly like this book. I didn't see what Augustus would see in Hazel in the first place, and their instantaneous love/attraction needed some build up. I saw the ending coming a mile away and I found the dialogue to be over the top and pretentious. The whole book lacked depth.
B00BCV3HGU|5.0|This was one of the few CDs/albums I have purchased where I liked EVERY song on it! There are three songs where Will.i.am mentions school and the importance of an education. I like rap when it is accompanied by singing and delivers a message. Will.i.am pulled it off very well. There are many duets on this cd with other well known artists, also. In all, it is just a fabulous, family friendly, contemporary cd.
B00FVS3RZQ|2.0|I am sure it is difficult to maintain the caliber of seasons 1 and 2 but the show just seems to be tapering off. Waning show, and so is my interest in it.  This rating is for season 4 only.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love it so much!  Love that I can play anywhere and any place.  Easy to play! Really enjoying it !
B000TU16GS|4.0|This book is so entertaining and action packed full of suspense and adventure one of the best books ever created
B000TXZP0S|5.0|Very good film about the real life Zodiac Killer of San Francisco, CA.  The acting was very well done and true to life story.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|I am enjoying the new release of the christian rock bands newest. Just great.<br />A definite hit. Wow. Praise the Lord.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|Excellent and amazing effects in this Blockbuster about the Global Warming Catastrophe.  Loved this film and will watch it again and again.
1442359315|3.0|not quite certain if his views ultimately were God and Christ related!  I loved the story but looked forward to hearing the highlight in my eyes would be the ultimate glory of our God and not the surface &#34;THINGS&#34;  we would like from heaven.  I don't know....I loved the story and the presentation.  None of it would be &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; to me.....the Word of God in the Bible to me is proof enough. I don't really know for certain that what this doctor experienced was the experience a believer would encounter.  Time will tell.  Bless this man and his family and God bless this doctor for his courage to share his believable experience.  I do believe him....just had a little trouble with the &#34;psychic stuff&#34;.  God gave him a Faith experience....not a psychic experience as his wife seems to think.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great usability out of the box, lots of potential still to be unlocked.... someday? Used primarily for Netflix and Youtube for now.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|For an educated man, this is surprising. His perceptions are proof of brain activity, not of heaven. I had hoped that a neurosurgeon would have something unique to offer
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is  absolutely the best game out I play it so much my wife is going to devorce me
0385743564|2.0|Before I say anything about this book, I must admit that I did not finish it - I simply could not bear to. This is the first (and perhaps the last) book I have read from this author.<br /><br />In the beginning, it was enjoyable. The set-up and premise were good and the writing was fluid. What I could not bear, however, was the stupidity of the characters and the shallowness of their relationships. Much of the dialogue appears to be contrived and inexplicable. The bad-with-metaphors \\"quirk\\" of the protagonist is an assault to the readers' intelligence at best. Personally, I found the protagonist extremely difficult to identify with, mostly due to his sheer stupidity.<br /><br />The major mystery in the novel (Steelheart's weakness) is easily guessed by the reader, yet the characters find it stupendously difficult to grasp. Keep in mind that I did not even finish the book - I was able to guess and confirm it about a third of the way through. Several pages later, the characters finally made infinitesimal headway - in the wrong direction.<br /><br />If you, like me, are easily put off by unintelligent, flat characters and do not have the perseverance to wait for a novel to inch towards a conclusion you have already surmised, I would suggest that you give this one a pass.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Surprised , thought I was about to watch something to do with airline crashes..only to see  a film about  alcoholism and it's effect on not only the consumer but also on innocent people .
B000W8HC8I|1.0|I had read the Buy Side and hoped this would be similar. The difference is The Buy Side was written by someone with a writing background. I could not get through this book. I found his writing style really exaggerated and he dwelled on one topic for way too long (an incident with his wife in the first chapter should have only taken a few pages but instead took about 30). There was very little about the life of a trader and too much about all the odd things that happened in his life. I gave up when I started skimming to find some topic with substance.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written; weak, unrealistic plot line. Sad that this book became so successful merely because of its sexual content. Should have been marketed as blatant pornography.
B002361MLA|2.0|Loved the message, but not the underlying anger that I felt within the pages; and to which was surprising to me to say the least.  I felt as if Eckhart Tolle was purposefully being combative to the &#34;questioner&#34; , and I cannot say why his book was laid out in such a fashion.  It was distracting to me. I found myself either skipping ahead in the book or just laying it down and intending to get back to it at a later date. I never did finish it.  I'm really disappointed, but did find some elements within the book that I could take away and instill in my own life. So for that I am grateful, but I really can't recommend this book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Not bad so far, enjoying it even though I just got it, but still definitely want to keep playing, even though class
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|how could u people think dieing is fun!?!?!?!?it is no fun what so ever! you agent people you are monsters!
B000N2HCM4|3.0|I understand why he now says the things he does. Don.t feel he has any connection or feels any allegiance to the US.
B007R41E8O|5.0|this is so far a very entertaining game. I like a game that I can go at my own pace, perfect. also it's not frustrating like some other games I have played.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A bit of a mystery and family sagas combined.  Takes place around Sydney, Australia.  The author cleverly brings the story full-circle.

B00124PXW8|5.0|One of the classic films of our time.  Great performances by the cast.  Visual effects are frighteningly realistic and the dialog is superb.  It will have you on the edge of your seat.  If you have blood in your veins this movie will frighten you, but, it's a different kind of fear than you had when you saw your first Frankenstein movie.
B00DWK5442|1.0|This is hands down the worst cookbook I have ever bought. I've found more satisfaction from the $4 '50 recipes that will change your life' type cookbooks.<br /><br />The book contains close to no pictures of the finished recipe, so you have no idea what you're aiming for. Even the few photos that are included are pretentious 'food' photos of people holding up a bowl in which you can barely see the food itself.<br /><br />But are the recipes instructive enough you don't need any visual guidance? Absolutely not. I've read cookbooks that literally have no photos at all, and I felt more guided than this book. On top of the fact that the recipes are hard to follow, the quality of the recipes don't seem be nearly as good as it should be.<br /><br />The only reason I give this one star is because 1. The photos are actually quite nice. It's a nice photography book with some less than mediocre recipes in it. 2. I can't give it a lower rating.
B00D7OXZTY|2.0|Before Recording the Seven famous Chopin polonaises Rafal Blechacz should have studied the recordings of Artur Rubinstein, Alexander Brailowsky, Halina czerny Stefanska, Witold Malcuzynski  and Adam Harasiewicz, to learn how These Works really should Sound . Instead listening to it, we hear speeding, uneven Tempos, blurred Passages<br />,over pedaling and Complete Lack of presence. I don't want to downgrade him, but the winner of Chopin's Famous<br />Competition in Warsaw , Poland should have been able to play these Works much better. I have lived with Rubinstein Three famous recordings of the Polonaises for more than sixty Years and many other Pianists and i Hope i Know how<br />They really should Sound.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|This isn't a review for my 20 years ago & 2003 film series as you can see I am reviewing Expendables 1 & 2 I saw both in theaters I had a better theater experience with the 1st movie & I had a good time with the 2nd movie in theaters as well. This movie was made for $80 million it made $ 34 million in it's opening weekend ended up making $103 in it's full US run overseas was a big hit making $274 million. Directed by Sylvester Stallone who has a lot of talent as a director plus he's my favorite actor. Basically the whole backtory of how this movie came to be is that Sylvester Stallone said the action genre has went to s # i t cause I grew up in the 90's & watched a lot of the 80's & 90's action movies. Ever since the mid to late 2000's action movies have been in this dead era. I mean I will admit there has been action movies that I have enjoyed from The 2000's but in the 80's & 90's had solid action movies about 2 or 3 every month. I thought guys like The Rock & Vin Diesel were going to be the new generation of action stars but Hollywood was focused on guys like Matt Damon who I like as an actor but he's not an action star. I am glad that Vin Diesel & The Rock are focused back on action. Stallone did a wonderful job casting Stallone stars as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas=, Jet Li as Yin Yang, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jenson, Eric Roberts as James Monroe, David Zayas General Garza, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Steve Austin as Paine, Giselle Itie as Sandra, Charisma Carpenter as Lacy, Mickey Rourke as Tool Box & Gary Daniels as The Brit. The story is this group of mercenaries called The Expendables lead by Barney Ross there going out after these Somali Pirates they give them the money & demand they let they let the hostages go 1 of The Merc's Gunner Jensen takes a Gernade Launcher blows 1 of The Pirates in half & he says \\"A little low.\\" This movie has some of the old 80's elements although this movie does have a somewhat serious plot so it has a good balance of both & but it updates it. When The Expendables have standoff with The Pirates Lee Christmas's phone goes off then they gun these pirates. Gunner is going to hang a pirate Yin Yang tries to stop Gunner but he is overpowered by Gunner Ross puts a gun to Gunner head & makes him stop. You find out that Gunner is an drug addict so they cut him from the team so to speak. I like how they highlight some of these characters lives like Lee Christmas goes to see his Girlfriend Lacy he finds out she is with another man he doesn't trust him which I will talk about a little later on. Your introduced to this mission corrdinator named Tool Box he is also a Tatoo Artist. There is a funny scene where Tool tells Lee Christmas that he should put a Spider Web Tatoo on the top of his head & have a Charlotte's Web where Charlotte would come out of his ear & make sure no bugs come inside. Barney gets work their is a cameo by Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger. I know people complained about this & said it was stupid but you got understand Arnold Schwarzenegger was still The Governor Of California & Bruce Willis was working on other movies at the time. This scene was funny I wasn't the only 1 laughing in the theater. Basically he gets work in the fictional country of Vilena. Gunner wants back on the team but Ross tells him no cause of his drug problem. Ross & Lee go & check out the island it's under the control of a CIA Turncoat named James Monroe General Garza who is more of a puppett. Ross & Lee pose as tourist's & they meet up with their contact this woman named Sandra. Lee decides to split up so they cover more ground. Ross & Sandra are confronted by Garza's troops where a shoot out breaks out Ross & Lee stop Garza's Men from taking Sandra you get a funny bit where 1 of Garza's Men is going to shoot Lee & Ross shoots that guy dead & he fires above Lee's head which prompts him to yell \\"Are you crazy you could've killed me!\\" Ross responds by saying \\"You're welcome!\\" So they try to escape they're chased by Monroe they get to the plane Sandra refuses to go cause Vilena is her country. You have a cool scene Lee goes into this hidden compartment where some kind of fuel dumped on the dock where Monroe & Garza's Troops are at Lee fires a 50 caliber machine gun & you have Lee fire a flare gun on the dock Monroe, Paine & The Brit jump off the dock in time. Ross decides to not go into Vilena. You have Gunner join Monroe's group Lee finds out that Lacy's Boyfriend is abusing her this scene is in my top 3 of the movie where Jason Statham goes to The Basketball Court he beats up the<br />pos boyfriend & his buddies he also scares the pos Boyfriend  he places it on top of him & stabs it & all the air goes out of the ball & he tells him \\"Next time I will deflate all your balls friend.\\" Monroe has Sandra captured against General Garza wishes cause Sandra is his Daughter. While talking to Tool how he feels about leaving Sandra behind & you get this very well done monologue by Mickey Rourke which gives Ross the will to go back to Vilena. Ross tells the team he's going alone where you have Yin Yang that is a type of dreamer who wants more money for his family. He tells Ross it's hard for me cause he is the smallest on the team you have this great chase scene Gunner is who is helping Monroe take The Expendables down you have Ross tells Yin Yang to get in the back of the truck cause he's smaller. Yin Yang is in the truck bed firing away with an Uzi. There is this guy in the passenger side yelling at Gunner that he won't let Monroe's Men do the job he kicks him in the head & calls him an insect. 1 thing leads to another they're in this warehouse where Dolph Lundgren & Jet Li put on this really good fight. Yin Yang is nearly killed Ross shoots Gunner in the chest. Gunner asks if he's going to die which I thought he died. He asks Gunner who sent him. The rest of the team joins Ross. They go into Vilena Ross goes to find Sandra the restof the team is setting these charges in the area. General Garza wants to talk to Sandra. You have these 2 troopers that are messing with Sandra Ross comes in cuts a hand off of 1 of the guys then he cuts his head clean off the other guy stabs him in the neck where the blade is sticking out of the back of the guys neck. Ross is stopped by Paine & The Brit Sandra is taken off to see her Father. You have General Garza tell her he should've been more like her he also believe's that Monroe is behind The Merc's invading Vilena. He drops a bag of money & tells Monroe to leave. You have the rest of the team come to make the save Ross goes after Paine. Lee & Yin Yang kill The Brit. For those of you who don't know Sylvester Stallone suffered a neck injury when Stone Cold throws Stallone into a wall. The rest of the team is outnumbered & pinned down then you have this crowd pleasing scene where Terry Crews comes in with an AA 12 Shotgun & just mows them guys down. If you've never seen this movie it needs to be seen to be believed. While Garza is giving a speech Monroe kills him & goes off with Sandra. Ross sets the charges off. Then you have this awesome action scene with Garza's Men are being gunned down their supplies is being destroyed The Expendables watch each others back. Yin Yang drops a gernade to block Monroe from escaping. Toll Road & Paine had good little fight Toll Road manages to knock Paine in the fire & I will admit that The CGI for Austin's death was bad. You have Hale Caesar pick up & toss this warhead in the air Ross he takes his 9 & fires it at the warhead it blows up The Helicopter Monroe is killed & liked how it was both Ross & Lee Christmas killing Monroe. Ross gives Sandra half of his money so it will go to Vilena's recovery. So final thoughts other than some characters not getting enough time & some bad CGI this movie was awesome great actions scene likable characters the humor is great the story was what it needed to be simple & straight forward. Youknow I don't need a deep plot for an action movie. Sylvester Stallone did a great job directing he also gave a great performance. Mickey Rourke was very good. Great job by Eric Roberts. Steve Austin as far as his work goes this has been his best role I was a fan of him when he was a Pro Wrestler not so much for his movies. David Zayas was very good. Jason Statham was good. Jason Statham was good. Jet Li did a good job. Terry Crews was good. I was surprised by Randy Couture him being a UFC guy & not much acting experience. I was fine with The Schwarzenegger Willis cameos I knew it would lead to something bigger. Dolph Lundgren was good. Giselle Itie was good. If you are a fan of this movie if you don't have The Blu Ray I recommend The Blu Ray. You'll get some good features if you have a Blu Ray. Next review will be Expendables 2.

B0037LK3R4|5.0|Jon krakauer writes an amazing adventure story of Chris McCandless and inspirational novel about Christopher McCandless and his perseverance. This story is an amazing and interesting story; Chris goes against the grain of society and leaves his household and grades good enough to get into Harvard to go off into the wild. Into the wild is not your ordinary adventure story; it's a story about perseverance and a man with a different outlook to society. Jon Krakauer makes a certain mood in the story and his type of writing is something that really shows who Chris really was as a person. Chris is portrayed as a hobo with a purpose.<br /><br />It doesn't matter what kind of person you are, a city goer or a mountain man, this book will intrigue you and stir emotions that you didn't know you had. The book captures the possibility of being someone different and extraordinary. This book will touch you emotionally in a lot of ways, sympathy yet hatred towards his parents, judgment of the people he meets, and finally you will not be sure whether you think that what Chris did was smart or stupid. You will not be able to figure out if Chris was onto an extraordinary life or one that will always end in bad times. The book confuses you emotionally but makes you wonder what is possible and how amazing going against what society wants you to do can be.

B005HHSYMW|5.0|Excellent detailed look at human violence and its path to modern day. The author contends that we live in a far less violent age, especially in the western world, despite the recent history of genocide. After reading just the summary of the considerable body of evidence he has amassed, it is possible to feel more optimistic about modern life. Particularly interesting is his canvassing of the factors in human settlement and 'civilisation' that have created the conditions that require us to live together more peacefully than in earlier ages.

0452273331|5.0|[[ASIN:0452273331 The Fountainhead]]<br /><br />The hero of Ayn Rand's modern classic, The Fountainhead, is visionary architect Howard Roark. The setting and time is east coast metropolis of the 1930s. The vogue of the New York City Intellectual Elite is conformity to a collectivist ideology - the deification of society as one living, breathing entity. It is a philosophy promoting the concepts of self-less altruism. Conversely, it damns any `selfish,' individualistic ego that may refuse to conform to the `common good of the whole,' one prominent example being Howard Roark.<br /><br />It is obvious to me that Rand is referencing socialism and communism in both of her classics, the other being Atlas Shrugged, published in 1957, but she never uses these two words or any variation thereof. Instead she employs the language and mindset that emanates from those who embrace these ideologies. It is a much more effective way to help us, the readers, to identify a nation that is in transition from personal liberty to mass enslavement. That is why both of Ms. Rand's classic novels have remained perpetual best-sellers from the dates when first published unto this very moment in time. Both remain relevant in A.D. / C.E. 2013.<br /><br />The story begins in the early Depression years when, despite the Art Deco movement, the architectural status quo was still linked to the past; to designs paying homage to ancient Rome and Greece, the Renaissance, to Gothic architecture and traditional British norms. In my opinion, Architect Howard Roark is a type of the great Frank Lloyd Wright, an innovator who dared to be different; to think outside of socially-established parameters. Roark is an unyielding man of genius. He has a vision for the future and will not compromise his `radical' architectural designs for any other man or any amount of money.<br /><br />Once a client signs-off on Roark's design, he must also sign a written affirmation that the building, whether a small house or majestic skyscraper, will not suffer any alteration during its construction; that the client will not give in to public criticism; nor to the peer pressure, which will predictably and inevitably implore him to build something more conventional and less controversial.<br /><br />Throughout the story, Howard Roark valiantly fights an uphill battle. He is condemned for his \\"selfish persistence,\\" his \\"arrogance,\\" his \\"lack of consideration for what is respectable,\\" for his refusal to accept all that is \\"safe, tried and true.\\" Many men of influence attempt to break him, to destroy him but he will not surrender. Roark has total confidence in his own visions. He knows that he is the future; that he will die in battle if necessary to remain faithful to his projected goals.<br /><br />I can personally relate to Roark's struggle because as a semi-retired commercial artist, copywriter and radio production director, I too faced an uphill battle because of my experimental concepts in advertising; ideas that spit in the face of accepted norms. Being merely an employee - one cog in a large machine - I generally lost my battles because I was a servant, not an independent freelancer. In the few instances where my \\"strange ideas\\" were allowed to become print and broadcast realities, I won top awards in the local ad club competition because our judges were generally flown-in from top agencies in New York or Los Angeles but sadly, most of my career has been given to concession.<br /><br />Howard Roark, Architect, epitomizes what I and thousands of other gifted men and women aspire to become - but rarely do.<br /><br />Ayn Rand weaves her Objectivist philosophy into The Fountainhead for reason of inspiring the reader. She demonstrates through her characters how \\"the virtue of selfishness\\" and triumph of the Ego, when personally embraced, can liberate a great mind to realize its full potential - no matter what the odds.<br /><br />If I had been mentally capable of comprehending Ayn Rand's writing style when I was in my late teens searching - as all teenagers do - for an identity, it may have changed the course of my life but as the tired, old clich&eacute; goes: \\"Hindsight is always 20-20.\\"<br /><br />Still at age 66, her two modern classics have given me renewed inspiration. Both have abolished the existential vacuum in my soul. They have brought to a screeching halt my protracted intellectual suicide and given me sound reasons to continue living, thinking, creating.<br /><br />In today's unstable society where young people are being indoctrinated with despair and hopelessness; when my generation in Washington, D.C. is creating an economic mortgage for our children and grandchildren that they will never be able to repay under our current socio-political system, Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are must-reads, and re-reads for those who may have forgotten that great civilizations are the product of great minds - the fruit of the few Atlases who set a determined course for their own pursuit of happiness but in the process, also bring major advances to the betterment of all humankind. Let us hope Atlas never does shrug.ng style when I was in my late teens searching - as all teenagers do - for an identity, it may have changed the course of my life but as the tired, old cliché goes: \\"Hindsight is always 20-20.\\"<br /><br />Still at age 66, her two modern classics have given me renewed inspiration.

0307341550|4.0|I wasn't crazy about Flynn's Gone Girl but decided to give her another try since so many others seem to like her books.  I'm glad I did.   I enjoyed this one much more.  It is a fascinating mystery about a topic that is not that well known or understood, and Flynn does a wonderful job.  You can feel the results of the characters' behaviors and predicaments from what seems like the inside of the experience.  Each time I thought I had the mystery figured out, there was a new twist pointing me in another direction.  This book kept me quickly turning pages right till the end.  I was so involved with the characters that it took me awhile to shake it and it is a difficult topic.  I will be reading more Flynn, but need a break from some  of these type of characters.  Very intense.  Four stars.

006202406X|1.0|I was so very excited for this book. So very excited.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found that this book was difficult to follow, difficult to read and in general left me wondering how it was written by the same author.<br /><br />All of the questions the first two books posed were given ridiculous and lazy answers like, &#34;just kidding&#34; and &#34;oh that was fake&#34; and nothing was tied up neatly. No answer that was provided was satisfying.<br /><br />Plus the whole thing felt ridiculously unreal. I kept saying, &#34;how are they getting away with that?&#34; &#34;how is no one noticing or stopping Tris/them?&#34; So very ridiculous and silly.<br /><br />I felt like I was reading a book by an amateur writer who hadn't quite grasped story, plot, believability, structure or HER AUDIENCE.<br /><br />I had a hard time making it to the end and once I got there I was completely disgusted. This book has absolutely killed my interest in the Divergent film as well now that I know how incredibly horrible and unsatisfying this book was as an ending to the trilogy.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|This production was top notch and once my husband and I started this series we couldn't stop it. Many hours of sleep were sacrificed. Directing and cinematography were very well put together. Like most of Dicken's works, this story was complex, mysterious and wonderful. The acting performances were amazing- some of the best we've seen yet and it's BBC productions like this that make it hard to ever return to most of the mainstream entertainment. The casting was spot on and the musical score was beautiful. The performance of Tom Courtenay(Dorrit's Father) was particularly outstanding and each character was talented and memorable. Every plot is tied into the next,so the viewer might want to watch when there are no distractions so as to pick up on details. Every moment is interesting and when all the facets unfold and come together it is truly an amazing close! We recently watched it a second time and found new pieces to the story we hadn't noticed before. A must watch and own.
1476734941|5.0|Here's some background before my review. I'm a 33 year old woman who has NEVER dieted. I have always been able to eat whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted and was very skinny - maybe even too skinny? I'm 5'2.5\\" and weighed 111 lb when I quit smoking after 16 years in April of 2012. I gained 9 lb in the first week - which made me nervous to say the least...was I going to gain 9 lb every week?!?! I stabilized after that, though. I signed up for my first triathlon before I even quit so I was working out really hard and gained another 5 lb. I was OK with my so-called muscle weight. Gaining 14 lb was difficult but I still looked good and knew I was really healthy so I was OK with it. After the triathlon my workouts fell off. I gained a few lb; nothing too drastic. By February of 2013 I had gained 10 - to 135. I still felt OK and looked good so I was not super worried. Then it happened - between March and April I gained 5 lb. I weighed 140 lb?!?! I freaked out, got on myfitness pal, got back to the gym, but continued to gain weight. I was frustrated to say the least. I'd obsess, stop thinking about it, and still gain weight.<br /><br />My mom saw an article about this diet in a fitness magazine and shared it with me in late August. By October, I maxed out at about 148 lb and was seriously losing it. I began thinking about how I used to eat when I was so skinny. It was similar to the fast diet - not on purpose but I'd have days I'd be so busy or stressed, I'd hardly eat at all. The rest of the days I'd eat normal - whatever I wanted. I decided to give it a try. The first fast day (a Thursday) I managed 923 calories. The next (Saturday) was 836. I gradually decreased but usually stay around 600 though the book says 500 for women. I think that doing it more gradually has made it easier and is why I've actually been able to stick to it for the five weeks and I recommend that to people trying this for the first time. You do have to listen to your body. 500 was too low the first week. Gradually, I've become used to eating less and it's not as hard. I now have a routine. There's a salad at the grocery store I love with fat free dressing that is only 300 calories. I don't eat anything in the morning. I like to save my calories for a more substantial meal. I'm totally full after eating it. I have tea in the afternoon to get me through till dinner when I have either two organic eggs and a pita for about 250 calories or a piece of fish and steamed veggies for about the same amount. That's what works for me and it took me a few weeks to figure that out.<br /><br />I did forget to fast two days during these last five weeks (meaning I only fasted one day during week 2 and week 4). From what I can tell on the scale (I weigh myself WAY too often) but I've lost 5 lb - 1 lb per week. I'm so excited! It's the ONLY thing that has actually made the number start to go down. I have another 18 lb to lose. I'm hoping to increase my weight loss to 1.5 lb per week by making sure I stick to the 500 calories and don't skip any fast days. That makes my goal only 12 weeks away! I'll update but I believe it's attainable. I'm not starving myself. I find that I'm not as hungry on my non-fast days. I look at it this way, when I binge out on food, I'm more hungry the next day. The fast works the same in way in reverse. When I refrain from eating so much, I'm not as hungry. Also, I never bought the book. I do love reading reviews though and am sure there is lots of valuable information in it.<br /><br />UPDATE - 11/5/2014<br /><br />I have been doing this diet on and off for the past 13 months. I am down a total of 18 pounds so far and I'm ecstatic. I still have 9 left to lose and they have been stubborn. I keep going up then down. I'm now back finally to my lowest I was two months ago by fasting two days in a row (down about three pounds I've been fluctuating around the last few months) and that seems to be the kick-start I needed. Not easy, mind you...but effective.I am now fasting Monday,Tuesday, & Thursday. I'm hoping to only have to keep this up a few weeks to get down the final 9 pounds and then plan to fast one day per week to maintain my weight and health benefits. I just thought I'd update my review to include this tip in case anyone else gets stuck or hits a plateau. Fasting two days in a row can be challenging. I just get into a zone and stay really busy. Sometimes it's actually easier than two non-consecutive days because I feel less hungry after my first fast day anyway, and a little bit of food fills me up so much quicker. Oh and water, water, water. And I'm a tea drinker so that helps curb the appetite too. Good luck everyone! :)& Thursday.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|i think the only other musical I can say ive ever watched is sweeny todd, this movie I  loved every much I turned on the tv one day and this movie was near the ending and it sucked me in to where I searched for other show times and set it to record to my dvr, just finished watching this and oh my gosh amazing. I like the whole setting and cast, the onyl complaint Id say is that hugh jacksons singing wasnt perfect but that didnt matter his acting and everything was well done. when I first saw anne hathaway in it as a charachter I was skepticle because I didnt know if she would be good in this cince her other movies I saw were just okay but she was amazing in this i was sad to see her only in half of the movie. anyways guess ill keep this short i reccamend this to people who dont even like musicals this movie was long but it didnt feel as long as it was in fact i was so into watching it I didnt want it to end i dont buy dvds often but this one I will because Id like to be able to watch it whenever I like

B00099BPP6|5.0|I previously owned the now incredibly disappointing Sinopoli version with Edita Gruberova, Renato Bruson, and Neil Shicof.  Shicof is a wonder and actually the best thing going on that cd.  Sinopoli cut out the optional high notes and as a result, there are some really disappointing moments (especially Si, Vendetta).  But I still enjoyed listening to the cd... until I heard Scotto sing Caro Nome.<br /><br />I loved Scotto even when she was past her prime and a little screechy.  But... this recording almost single-handedly turned her into my favorite soprano ever.  Caro Nome is unbelievably emotional and extravagant... a master class of perfect technique and emotional connection.  I like Bergonzi as well... his versions of the famous arias carry a unique stamp.  Although I love a Rigoletto with a few vocal fireworks and embellishments (young Sherill Milnes), Fisher-Deskau is incredible here.  Like Scotto, he is so emotionally connected which in turn, affects the listener.<br /><br />Scotto's vocals turned this into my favorite recording of any opera, and turned Caro Nome into my favorite aria.  The ending is also unforgettable.

0375842209|5.0|There are very few times in my life where a historical event really affects me.  History is taught so clinically that the events seem so factual, not human, and almost not relatable.  The two times I have become emotionally involved in the past have been because I read a fictional book that used that setting or event as the background for the story.  The first time this happened was when I read LAMB by Christopher Moore.  The next was today, as I read The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.   There is so much to say about this book that I am having trouble putting it into words.  Markus Zusak did such an incredible job describing what the life of an everyday German was like during the time of Hitler and WWII.  I really had never even thought about the ordinary people.  When you think of Germany in WWII you think about the Jews, Anne Frank, or the Nazi's.  History books just don't talk about how life was, or that there were a lot of people in Germany that didn't agree with the propaganda, but had no choice but to comply with the laws.   The character development was also phenomenal.  It blows my mind.  And when bad things started to happen to the characters as a result of the poverty or air raids it just grips your heart and tears you to pieces.  I think it affects me so much because on a logical level I know that events in the book happened in real life, maybe not exactly like that but there were real innocent people in bomb shelters, and losing family to the war or malnutrition.  In my lifetime I will never experience that kind of reality, but through this book I lived it in my mind and in my heart.   This is the type of book that as you are reading it, you want so badly for the ending to be happy.  But I am glad it isn't.  This way it's more relatable and true to history.  I in fact had to double check that this was a Fictional book and was not based on someone (Liesel's) life story.  I did learn that the author took stories his parents told of Germany and integrated theminto the story, which explains how realistic the book is.   The other significant part of this book is the Narration.  You would expect that the main character (Liesel) to be the Narrator as it is her story.  But I think making Death the narrator and really humanizing him made the book better.  He leaves little insights and tidbits that resonate with the reader.  For he is reluctant and tired, at the same time he is respectful and gentile and invested in one little girl.  For him to be so busy but take time to check in on one human means there is something special about her.  I think this book is one of those that you read as a young adult and then again as an adult when you can read it without having to write a report on analyze it.  This is a must read for both young adults and older adults.  It is heart wrenching and thought provoking.    Check out more YA book reviews and other fun things at [...]

0142410705|2.0|An Abundance of Katherines is written by John Green who also wrote Looking for Alaska, a book which I have previously read and reviewed.  I want to like his books so much.  The characters and plot are always so well developed.  But the one thing that holds me back is the extremely intellectual language and content that is his books contain.  As an adult a lot of the dialog is lost on me I can't imagine reading a book like this as a teen.  It would make me feel so inferior.<br />Katherines main character, Colin, is a child prodigy but not a genius.  So he is super smart but didn't go to college at like 11.  He is supposedly not great at math but that math he does is completely over my head.  Even the supporting characters are smart.  Each one can speak at least 2 languages.  They are supposed to be 17, but seem to have intelligence and introspective of a 60 year olds.  The personal revelations that each character comes to are completely unrealistic.  Not a single 17 year old I know or have known discovers \\"who they are\\" or major character flaws they possess at that age.  It's ridiculous to even presume that.  Not to mention that Colin is fairly well adjusted for someone who spent their life in a book and studying.  To have had 19 girlfriends at the age of 17 is ludicrous; most people have never had 19 girlfriends/boyfriends in their entire lives much less in 17 years.  The other thing that really got to me was a major faux pas; at one point the characters meet a woman at a fast food joint in Tennessee, and she says \\"Y'all have fun now, y'hear\\".  We don't talk like that, like ever.  I have been in the south for 16 years and have never heard a southern say that.  It's a little offensive to be honest.  Clearly John Green is a brilliant person and writer and for him to make that generalization about Southerner's vernacular shows lack of insight and creativity on his part.  Although I will give him props for hitting the nail on the head with the Southern hospitality thatwas depicted in the book.  That is absolutely true.<br />So other than my prior complaints I didn't hate the book.  I liked it in fact.  The story moved pretty well, the characters were great, funny, witty really everything I wish I could be at 17.  Would I recommend this book to a young adult, probably not.  Would I recommend this book to someone my age, yes.  Do I think that I learned a moral lesson from this book, not really.  It was a good read in that it was interesting but I didn't connect with the characters the way I have with other books.  The ending was also slightly disappointing. Over all it was an \\"eh\\" book.<br /><br />Check out more YA reviews at [...]

B0000CEB4V|5.0|If I could pick a concert to have attended, it would be this one! What an amazing musical event!!<br />George's songs are still awesome, and the band was amazing.<br />Kudos to Eric Clapton for sharing the stage with other guitarists: Andy Fairweather-Low, who has played alongside him for decades, and two others: Albert Lee, the gray-haired guy, who plays one solo (not nearly as exceptional as he can be); and Marc Mann, the guy in the Irish cap playing a Strat. Mann was a mystery guy who has played with Jeff Lynne and ELO, and he actually upstages Clapton on \\"Something,\\" plays slide on several songs, and then goes off on \\"Wah Wah.\\" Mann emerged as my hero!<br />Other highlights: Tom Petty's band, Joe Brown, and Joe's beautiful daughter Sam.<br />I believe George would be proud -- and would have really enjoyed this concert. Especially to see his son, Dhani, playing with his old friends. As McCartney said, \\"Olivia said seeing Dhani [who looks like a young George] on stage makes it look like all of us aged and George stayed the same age!\\"<br />Timeless!<br />Fun!<br />Wonderful!

B000093W3A|5.0|This album really did bring rave culture more into the light in the early nineties. There has already been so much written about this album... if you enjoyed some of the early nineties sounds-- like The Stone Roses, and in general liked a lot of the bands that defined the Manchester scene, like &#34;The Happy Mondays&#34;, then you should have already heard this record. It's considered a classic, Primal Scream have never topped it, and it still holds a very special place in my heart to this day. Vinyl is back in a big way, and this is a record worthy of an audiophile quality remastering. Worth every penny and then some!

B0058YPL66|5.0|My husband refers to this show as my pro wrestling. The acting is B rated at best... but it is entertaining! It is fun to watch the interwoven fairytale stories in this series. It's never really raunchy, vulgar or gross. So in that way, it is a pretty rare program on prime time. I'm not against a vulgar, raunchy or gross show (I love some good old fashioned zombie killing) but it is a nice palette cleanser. Something different to stir things up.

B004EPZ06Q|4.0|I rented this movie on Blu-ray over the long weekend, and it was successful in making me laugh out loud on several occasions. I may be in the minority, but I think this movie is actually funnier than the first Hangover. Ken Jeong is once again the savior (not plot-wise, but in terms of general hilarity), making this an exercise in the absurd and rambunctious. Anybody looking for a dose of philisophical pondering or a good ruminating upon the existential dilemma had best move on... but if you're seeking a bunch of laughs doled out via drug-dealing monkeys in banana-clad biker helmets, among other things... well then, you've come to the right place!

B00E4W40C4|4.0|It was fun for what it was, but this movie ultimately gets lost in a weird sort of limbo - it's half modern Marvel movie, and half throw-back to the incredible graphic novel from the late 80s. I wish there had been more emphasis on Logan's battle with the samurai clan, which is genuinely interesting, and a joy to watch in any format. However, Hugh Jackman is still THE man, and his inhuman charisma carries the movie along, even when it should, by all rights, stumble. He is a fantastic actor, and a fantastic human being (this is the guy who stops in the park to cameo for film students), and he is, as always, a joy to witness as the Wolverine.

B008JFUO4U|5.0|I just watched this movie on Blu-ray, and I was very, very impressed. Visually speaking, this is the type of Blu-ray that makes me lean forward in my seat, the sights are so eye-popping. The rendering of a post-apocalyptic earth afflicted by nuclear winter is strangely beautiful, as is the way in which the story is presented. Those who dislike Tom Cruise will not be able to move past his presence (he is in virtually every frame of this two hour movie), but for those who are interested in a unique, mind-bending sci-fi spectacular... you are in for a treat!
B00F5HWC7W|4.0|It's hard to believe it's been almost a decade since The Killers first burst onto the scene. I remember when Hot Fuss and its singles were everywhere, seemingly coming out of nowhere and surprising all of us with their energetic and passionate performances. This collection celebrates the band's first decade together and it's exactly what you would expect from a basic hits collection. From the big hits like \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"When You Were Young\\" to newer masterpieces like \\"A Dustland Fairytale\\" and \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\", everything here does a solid job of representing the band's radio singles and popular tunes. The one surprise comes with \\"The Way It Was\\", which was never released as a single but it's a track I've always loved so I can forgive its inclusion here, as well as \\"Be Still\\", which closes the deluxe edition. It's another wonderful track that seemed like an underdog on Battle Born. The two new tracks \\"Shot at the Night\\" and \\"Just Another Girl\\" are both solid and grow on you with every spin. It's really amazing to see how well the songs in this collection have aged. \\"All These Things That I've Done\\", \\"Read My Mind\\", and \\"Human\\" still sound as fresh as they did years ago and The Killers have a knack for writing songs that seem to transcend trends and certain time periods. Direct Hits is certainly a testament to that mentality and to the band's ability to shift their sound from album to album. It's more apparent than ever with this release just how ambitious they are and the drive they maintain to never make the same album twice.<br /><br />That being said, there are a few glaring omissions. The bombastic \\"Bones\\" is sorely absent here, as are \\"The World We Live In\\", \\"Tranquilize\\" (featuring the late Lou Reed) and \\"Here with Me\\".  I understand they had to cut a few tracks but it would have been nice to see these included on the deluxe version. It's also disappointing that diehard fans, aside from the two new songs, don't have much to gain from this. Obviously it's geared toward casual fans and newcomers, which is fine, but including a bonus disc of b-sides or a DVD would have gone a long way toward making this feel more like a more inclusive and complete package. It's a minor complaint but one I suspect many fans will voice.<br /><br />In the end Direct Hits manages to hit most of its targets. For those who want just the basics or an organized introduction to the group then this collection is a good place to start. It's just a bit disappointing to see a lack of bonus content, especially in light of what bands like U2, Keane, and Foo Fighters have done with their respective collections. That would have elevated this release from solid to essential.<br /><br />Their first decade was truly fantastic. Let's hope they have at least another ten or twenty years left in them.it's geared toward casual fans and newcomers, which is fine, but including a bonus disc of b-sides or a DVD would have gone a long way toward making this feel more like a more inclusive and complete package.

B00BCJ1AXE|4.0|I love this cd. I just wish that it was ACTUALLY censored. I purchased it so that I could listen to it in the car with my child in the backseat. Unfortunately, most of the bad language was not taken out...just the worst words.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I very much enjoyed the experiments and had superb results with the ones I have done. I also much enjoyed the humor as Pam made me laugh out loud several times. Good education, well written and an all around outstanding read. I recommend this book.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />When I first picked up this series I fell in love. Divergent was by far my favorite. After reading Insurgent I had high hopes for the last novel. The third book just went in a total different direction for me. I know the whole big idea was to find out what was outside the walls, but when it actually got around to it, the direction Veronica Roth decided to go was way off for me. This book changed the meaning of the series and what it means to be divergent. The whole new world outside of the factions just seemed odd in the scheme of things. I will not go into the Tris and Four relationship in detail, but their chemistry and relationship is part of the reason why I loved these books from the beginning. I was so heart broken and disappointed in the end. Tris's death was just so unsatisfying and unexpected to me. I know all books don't end the way your want with a nice little bow wrapped around it, but I was hoping their relationship and their characters would see it through till the end. I felt like Tris deserved a more heroic death and death deserved more &#34;text&#34; if you will. I honestly did not realize she actually died when she got shot, I thought she would magically pull through, I just feel like she deserved more. I am just sad the way this series ended, it definitely did not live up to my expectations.

0062238868|5.0|I borrowed this book from local library via Kindle. This guy is very witty and some of the sentences, he writes after a paragraph, are just plain hilarious. His wife contributes sometime and we know her side of the story. This guy writes straight what he feels...very honestly. He curses at \\"big fat-a$$ congressmen\\" who don't know what's going on the front line and make rules not knowing how bad the situations are in war. So I like his honesty.<br />If you are critique of writing, you don't want to read this book as, being a SEAL, he writes for average Joe like us.<br />And last but not least: a big THANK YOU for your service.

0345803485|5.0|They started very good and ended up great.  You can tell the author was telling about some of her experiences and also some of her fantasies and it was hard to find the line between what she experienced and what she fantasized.  Being from Georgia myself I could identify with the small, fragile looking, young lady being competent to handle difficult, even seemingly impossible situations when they came up.  Also wanting to please, &#34;her man&#34; is a trait found in many Georgia girls.<br /><br />She knew this character so well I was very surprised to learn the author was from Australia.  Probably she knew someone from there or had a friend reveal some of these character traits to her.  Either that or she is a great researcher.  Her description of the mother and father who raised her were, &#34;right on&#34;, also.  I know family members who are like them in many ways.<br /><br />And the guy could have easily been from Texas where I reside now.  Competent, strong willed and very rich by applying sound business principles automatically to almost any business opportunity.  Also finding this too easy and unfulfilling  after a while and needing a new challenge to really test his ability, which his new girl friend readily provided, and surpassed him in a few meaningful ways.<br /><br />Great books if you don't let the explicit language and unusual sexual practices side track you.  They help tell the story with gusto, but a little too much even for me sometimes.

B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|First and foremost, this the most consistent and vital Pearl Jam album in a over decade. My personal preference is for the middle period of Pearl Jam's career, roughly Vitalogy through Binaural. Everything they have done since Binaural, excluding the excellent Lost Dogs, has been fairly hit or miss.  This feels like the record they have been trying to make since the Avocado album. It is mostly in the the more straight ahead rock vein of that last few, but with more solid results.  However, there are a few experiments sprinkled in along the way as well(My Father's Son, Infallible, Pendulum). The production of Brendon O'brien and the polished engineering helps make those forays play nicely along side the streamlined songs, for better or worse. Vedder's lyrics here are also some of the most resonate and artfully drawn in some time.  The bottom line is Lightning Bolt provides a little something for every \\"Jammer\\", no matter what era you prefer.  It also serves as a proper reintroduction to the band, for casual fans that have not traced every move Pearl Jam has made through the years. Lightning Bolt is the most essential later era Pearl Jam album.
0671240862|5.0|I have long been interested in the process of self development and cannot understand how this tome has escaped me until this point.  This book was exceptional and I was impressed with how forward thinking the author was considering it was written more than three decades ago.<br /><br />I see some people feel there is too much of a religious slant to this book.  This kept me at bay before I decided to purchase it.  i am not opposed to theological study, but I don't like to mix genres and am especially disappointed when a book does not advertise it will be more a less a God endorsement book.  I  am glad I looked passed my prejudice.  In fact the author has an extremely evolved view on &#34;God&#34; that is more philosophical than religious at the end of the day.<br /><br />I found some flaws with the book but when I took into account this is a 30 year old book found those flaws easily forgivable. I think it was years ahead of its time and considerably better than many of todays attempts at self development

The main part of this toy, very well constructed-- but the mirror broke off within an hour of use by my two year old.

Whenever I like life just doesn't make sense, I pick up this book up, or Can You Keep A Secret? or Undomestic Goddess and give it a good read. We all have our comfort foods, but I can't go down the food path anymore as a diabetic. So I have my comfort reads. And once I read one of these three books (all by Sophie Kinsella, by the way), things seem to make sense again. Perhaps it's because these loveable, fictional women finally finds something in the end that just makes sense to them.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn does it again. Dark Places is an exceptional novel that keeps you guessing until the very end - and wow what an ending!
B008MC175A|5.0|Bought this as an early Christmas gift for my pregnant girlfriend. She absolutely loves it! The Blu-Ray quality is incredible and adds 10x intensity to the action motion pictures! Great buy, and it was even delivered on Sunday!!!! WOW!
B004FOA84A|4.0|High quality all around, sometimes subtley amusing and often clever.  It's not very long but quality is better than quantity.  I guess the title is misleading--no spooky stuff.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|SUCH A CUTE GAME FOR CHILDREN. MY 5 YR OLD LOVES IT! I SUGGEST DOWNLOADING THIS APP FOR CHILDREN WHO CAN READ.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I needed a compact flash for indoor family shots. This fits the bill perfectly. It does bounce mode fairly well. Highly recommend.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Great show! Suspense around every corner! The writer definitely knows what they're doing when it comes to keeping the audience guessing.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works great.  All my knives are sharp once again.  I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a good sharpener.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|This CD is great! I have listened to it a ton of times already. It is a CD where I like a bunch of the songs. Settle Down, Cameo Lover, Two Way Street, Plain Gold Ring, Come into My Head, Good Intent..JUST BRILLIANT! She has such a smooth, elegant voice.
B0027Z5DM6|4.0|Almost all of our family enjoyed this movie. It sparked a lively discussion among the kids and adults about what we would do with a &#34;clicker&#34; like his and what it would mean to us.
B00DJXSKWU|1.0|the game seems good at first but its really boring and glichy, note the game is redundant and it becomes dull
B0002HZ18C|4.0|The little tug turned out great. Easy to follow instructions and all the parts were included. I will order again.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett's second novel in the \\"Century Trilogy\\" (following on the heels of \\"Fall of Giants,\\" which focuses on the WWI era) takes our favorite families into the next generation and World War II.  In a novel that spans the 1930s and 1940s over 900-plus pages, Follett has created a page-turner that is yet massive in scope and heft.<br /><br />The Century Trilogy, so far, offers a lot to admire.  Follett's characters span the globe - Welsh, Russian, American, German - and have a magical ability to appear in key yet anonymous roles at pivotal historical events.  Follett's characters witness the rise of Hitler, the Blitz's raids on London, the Russian front, Pearl Harbor, the fall of Berlin, Stalin's near-ouster as de facto tsar, and even the Manhattan Project.  Through it all, Follett keeps events moving quickly, and the characters are just as absorbed in their love lives and marriages (not always the same thing) as they are in the four-power division of Berlin or sussing out spies at Los Alamos.<br /><br />For fans of history, this can be a bit frustrating as major events are given two or three pages.  I find it enjoyable, though, because Follett is not telling the story of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and Generals leading their nations through war, but instead on the impact of titanic events on the everyday people.  Well, perhaps not 'everyday' people, as Follett's characters are given more than their fair share of talent, ambition and dedication.  But they are definitely not the Great Men of the era, even as they rub shoulders with them.<br /><br />But it is refreshing to read the stories of people coping with the hell of the mid-20th century.  Yes, the world nearly tore itself apart, but somehow we made it through, and Follett's point seems to be that humanity survived in large part due to the quiet heroism of everyday people - those who refused to yield when tested (and tested, and tested again).<br /><br />All in all, another genre-defining epic of historical fiction by Mr. Follett.
B00DJAUP08|5.0|Amazing record! Even better on heavy weight vinyl!<br />Slamming in any format but really bumps on LP!<br />Nice work guys!
B00ENXBUR2|4.0|The Acrylic Stand that came with the set is faulty.  The bracket the Tin is supposed to stand on is not going fully into the base.  I had to sand down part of the bracket so it could go into the hole in the base.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|addicting game....lots of fun...sometimes the resource collection gets a little buggy but overall a fun strategy game. sometimes I wish there was a little more ability to attack players of similar rank easier but game works for me...
0780622650|5.0|Lost in Space is such a fun movie.  I used to watch the TV show and this movie is good.  I have already watched it several times.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|olive this app because its just like the movie but its a game.plus there's freaking robots.its realy fun so I hope you have a lot of fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved this book :) I had to buy the second right after I finished. Only book I've actually finished.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch pulls the reader right into the life of its young protagonist Theo via a violent event, a terrorist attack in an art museum, where Theo's mother dies and he steals a painting, a masterpiece. This pivotal event powers the plot, which is credible only through Donna Tartt's brilliant writing. Theo's character is developed through dramatic hardships. He struggles with PTSD and an obsession with a girl who was also damaged in the museum explosion.<br /><br />But it is Theo's obsession with the painting that explores the theme of beauty and the power and purpose of art. Because Ms. Tartt creates her characters so skillfully and builds the story so competently, I was completely invested in her view. The power of the aesthetic experience is understood here. We are led to wonder where meaningful beauty and idolatry intersect.<br /><br />Theo's experience of love is twisted by his neurosis, but the novel's exploration of romantic love, practical pairing versus true love, is universal. Actually, there are many ways that Theo rejects the ordinary and chooses the extreme, even when it's quite destructive. He learns about fate and luck from his gambling father, and forms vague beliefs based on his dramatic experiences. His philosophy of life is understandably grim. But this is a character we root for, and this is a book that I am very happy to have read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't believe I never read this book before. Great job Mr. Card.<br />I would recommend to anyone and everyone.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Great action movie with just enough romance to make it interesting. Loved the interplay between the characters and especially Thor and Loke.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! If I had to pick just one word, I would sat addictive! I just keep coming back for more! Love it, love it, love it!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|A typical but captivating love story based on Jane Austen's novel....Love deprived by her self absorbed father and selfish older and younger sisters, Ann is left on her own to manage the mundane things in the home and to run errands and provide whatever the rest of the family needs.  She finally reunites with the man she loves and this time, she chooses him over what the family wants.  It is an intriguing dance in the pages of history with well behaved manners and pithy well chosen words that draw you in.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book was very well written but depressing. Death tells the story of a young German girl (The Book Thief) left with foster parents in Germany during the time of Hitler. They hide a Jewish young man in the basement. This is their story, excellent reading but sad.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this adventure into the unknown. Mr. Pettyer weaves a thrilling and captivating tell of another world and how Earth Is involved with its survival.  Suspense, adventure and anticipation all combine to make a thoroughly enjoyable read wanting you to come back and read more. You become involved in the lives of these struggling aliens and they become your heroes....a very satisfactory tale. Also, a little romance thrown in to make it more palatable to the ladies.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I haven't been able to get beyond 10 minutes of reading, and most of that time was spent skimming.  I loved the first Bridget Jones and even enjoyed the second installment, but with Mark Darcy out of the picture and Bridget's continued obsession about....everything, weight, men, twitter...she has lost her charm.  She's 51 in this book - grow up already.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it's so addicting and me my sister  and my mom love this app so it's also a great family game
B00846REIS|5.0|Great follow to 50 shades of Grey.  I would use this as a filler, not a substitute to the other.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|great way to pass the time was surprised at the ease of play. the sound was also quite amusing. ghr touch detection could use some minor adjustments.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun, the directions are easy, the characters are great and the background is great.  The game is addicting though.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the best in series.  I think I understand the characters better due to the history offers in the book.  Long read.  I had it on audio and readable or I would still be reading.. don't start if you don't have time to spare
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've totally fallen for this show and season 3 was awesome!  You really get caught up in the lives of everyone.  I can't wait for more episodes.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|I love this album and I love Ray La Montagne.  Great variety in the songs. Ray La Montagne is unique.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This author has a gift of being able to manipulate words in unimaginable ways.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Book Thief and will re-read in immediately.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This album has some real hits on it. G.U.Y is a musical and lyrical masterpiece, Gaga's take on feminism and power. I dare say it can rival Bad Romance as one of her best works. Sexxx Dreams, Donatella, Venus, and Fashion are incredible listens. I would say Gypsy, Dope, and Mary Jane Holland were all tracks that I did not care for initially, but became very addictive. These three songs have been listened to on repeat more than anything else, despite them not being my favorites. The low points on the album for me are Manicure, Jewels and Drugs, and Swine, with Jewels and Drugs being the best of the 3. I found the sound of swine to be off putting (maybe the point), and the lyrics to be somewhat incoherent. I still give the album 5 stars since these 3 songs are not bad enough to detract from the high quality of the overall album. Artpop is the life that the pop world has been missing.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I really can't speak the language I'm learning or be able to comprehend someone speaking to me in said language.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was a good story and we all wondered what ever happened to Danny Torrance. I love the references back to the Overlook.
B0054R6BFM|2.0|The previous reviews had me really excited about this book. I don't typically pay much for ebooks but decided to splurge on this one. It switches back and forth between what one character is thinking and what he is listening to on an audiotape. It can be rather difficult to keel up with. There are moments that leave you on the edge of your seat but not enough to make it a \\"good read\\" for me.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This CD opened up my eyes and showed me a different side of Eminem.  I knew he was an awesome rapper, but this CD showcased skill I did not know he had and as a fan of hip-hop since it bagan, I will say this guy is one of the best EVER.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Such an interesting read!  I could not stop reading and kept wondering what I would do if put in the same position.  Great for a book group discussion!
B00F3VOL38|4.0|1994's \\"Live At The BBC\\" is a delightful eavesdrop into a time when The Beatles \\"performed live via tape\\" on Britain's BBC Radio. Instead of just playing their EMI recordings, The Beatles prepared \\"new\\" recordings of their popular songs and occasionally odd and unreleased cover tunes for play on various BBC radio programs. The album even included an otherwise unreleased Lennon & McCartney song called \\"I'll Be On My Way\\". A very exciting time to be a Beatles fan.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2013...Suddenly it was announced that there would be another official release of BBC recordings. When I heard this was about to happen, I had a hunch that the second volume would be just as good as the first. No regrets. I've listened to \\"BBC Vol.2\\" twice already, and I am very pleased. The last thing I was expecting was another Beatles album of previously unreleased recordings. \\"On Air...Live At The BBC Volume Two\\" is a worthy companion to the first volume.
B00CHS31DG|4.0|This piece of software is interesting, and entertaining -- at first.  The &#34;events&#34; that the game &#34;detects&#34; are too disconnected to hold your interest for very long.  The words that it supposedly &#34;hears&#34; spirits &#34;speak&#34; are too disconnected and infrequent to seem real.  It is a form of electronic ouiji board, and is a fascinating concept for entertainment software.  With some refinement, and a better vocabulary,  this could be a very compelling application.  I liked the concept, but unfortunately it got boring and I soon lost interest in playing with it.  The graphics are smooth, well done and render well on my Samsung Galaxy S4.
B008MM9630|4.0|I like this. Simple and fun to play. You don't need tons of neighbors which is nice for a change
