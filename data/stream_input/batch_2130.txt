B000FC13UE|5.0|As someone who doesn't even like short stories, this collection is a treasure. I had it in paperback years ago, but having the kindle edition is great fun. I can run through an entire short story while waiting for a bus.
B005ZUR724|4.0|wont let me download. have it on my phone but wont let me dl It on here. any ideas or am I screwed lol other than that great game on phone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never thought I would like something so much. I pin everything. Everyone should get this app. I go on this site first thing in the morning. and last this I do before I go to sleep. I have gotten such good information from pins. some of the recipes I would have never found on the Internet if not for pinterest.
B003R50FRI|5.0|A fantastic read... wonderfully written..... sensitive and informative. I have new insight into this particular way of life in India
0316010669|4.0|perfict for the beginner and a great investment .<br />That is all I have to say about this book right now
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such an amazing page turning book, couldn't put  it down!!! I can't wait for the next one!!! I'm still in awe!
0061438294|4.0|perfict for the beginner and a great investment .<br />That is all I have to say about this book right now
B00846F1YW|3.0|This game would be good for some one just starting out with hidden object games. I haven't seen much evidence of a &#34;crime&#34;.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|Got this as it was the free app of the day.Only played once and am addicted already. Not a difficult game,just turn the cube and match up blocks to slowly break down the cube until it's all gone.I can imagine it would be quite easy to loose track of time whilst playing this game as the temptation is there to try and beat your time.Good fun and well worth a try.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Was hoping for more game options.  It's great you can change the backs of the cards or it would be boring.
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit is a good book. I haven't finished reading it yet.<br />It is very interesting. Thanks so much.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Great app if you need to access your desktop. Granted, free app only allows wifi access, limited at that, but the paid version opens up more options for accessing the desktop. I use this app if im in another room and need a file from my desktop or laptop. emulates your desktop on your tablet. now you have touch screen computer. easy install and startup
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Must see all three.  This was the center of the series and the height of the action.  I personally love the third one as the perfect conclusion to the trilogy.  This is a must have !
B000F1IQNM|1.0|Wrong region it does play in Europe reg. 2 I bought this and other DVD's for grandchildren for when they come to visit. Well they won't see this one.
0783231032|5.0|This film was awesome, with Belushi playing Wild Bill Kelso, a crazed Army Air Corps fighter pilot chasing a phantom Japanese squadron to Robert Stack in his straight role as Vinegar Joe Stillwell, an Army commander who would fight on the Chinese Front (and get little credit for his efforts). The movie included some of the crew from Animal House and, to the detriment of the film, focused too much on the sex gags in some places. Yet it had many memorable scenes: The antiaircraft gun placed in someone's front yard, the mad colonel convinced he's being attacked by  enemy parachutists, the Japanese I-boat crew trying to find Hollywood, the technical whiz of a sergeant, the dummy on the ferris wheel. It made for a fun movie, if a long one.<br /><br />As an aside, many of the events portrayed in the movie are based on fact, although obviously not as shown. Following Pearl Harbor there was indeed a Battle of Los Angeles, in which war nerves led to an all out flak barrage over the city during a false alarm (I think some UFO nuts still try to claim flying saucers were responsible). There were indeed Zoot Suit Riots in L.A., at least partially ethnically-motivated.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters in this film: Dan Ackroyd, John Candy, Christopher Lee, even Lenny and Squiggy as Air Defenders! It's like my generation's version of It's  Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. If you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to watch.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This the 5th book I have read and not finished it yet but it great.Don't let the number of pages put off like the other 3 in this series I am really enjoying it.
B0040X46TE|4.0|The first time I heard the titile song by Isreal I stopped in my tracks to listen. That song and \\"Wind beneath my Wings\\" are enchanting. I liked the songs sung in the native language. My only complaint is that I did not understand what Isreal was saying when he spoke. I keep playing the album over and over.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|An odd little movie.  Kind of fun, but doesn't make sense in parts.  Amazon had it onsale, so I watched it.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay full price.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|A real mysteery that upon review  at the end,everything makes sense. A book that you don't want to put down
B00APUQT7I|2.0|Your standard Ice Age fare, the same aging characters.  But the story line is getting VERY thin.  Somehow there are pirates who maneuver an iceberg around like a ship?  Really?  An iceberg?  The entire logic of why pirates would exist during this time period is stupid.  The whole teenage mammoth segment was unnecessary.  This is the worst of the series.
0316228532|4.0|When you've devoured all seven of the Harry Potter books by Miss Rowling, you have certain expectations about the kind of books she will continue to write. The Casual Vacancy took me rather by surprise. This isn't a kids book. It deals with a very interesting and highly controversial subject. I recommend it highly. Rowling has offered us a great deal with this new book.
1936719010|5.0|This book makes me sick.  Makes me sick I didn't discover it earlier.  Makes me sick how Pressfield makes genius seem so apparent.  But most of all, makes me sick I didn't write it myself.<br /><br />If you find yourself getting in your own way, this manifesto is just the impetus to breakthrough to your next epic accomplishment.  You'll never want to play small again after reading this book.  If you loved \\"The War of Art,\\" you will be orgasmic with this follow up book.  It is skewed to creative types like writers, but the lessons on overcoming resistance apply to everyone in any field.  And the tone of his manifesto will inspire you in anything you do.  This book is brilliant, simply brilliant.<br /><br />-RG
B007L96VCY|5.0|I'm a  big Beatles fan, and have also enjoyed their solo work.  I first heard &#34;Admiral Halsey&#34; on a camping trip and the song brings back great memories.  I was looking for great sound to go along with the great music.  I almost got it.  The sound on the CD is very good, but falls just a bit short of what I think it could have been, judging from other re-masterings.  The surprise is the second CD, featuring unreleased songs, a single, and alternate versions.  I really enjoyed it, especially &#34;A Love for You&#34;.  The purchase is worth it just for these extra songs.
B004I4H8QS|5.0|Old classic re-made on CD gave to a friend for 60th Birthday, a hit again along with Dire Straits Greates hits.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this movie, waiting very patinently for it to come out on DVD. It is a great movie to have.

B006YB9VJU|5.0|The service was very good, the product arrived as request.<br />The product was excellent, and was sent on the date specified, and their arrival was equally efficient.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Interesting characters and a possible alien rebellion put this series way above similar TV shows.  It is definitely not predictable; not everyone survives the alien invasion.
B004SRNH10|1.0|I have found it very annoying to find so many Android products like [[ASIN:B004SRNH10 Adobe AIR]] that are not compatible with Kindle, even though the Kindle can run a large number of Android apps.  It would be VERY helpful if you (Amazon) would take the time to CLEARLY state whether an app WILL or WILL NOT work on a Kindle.  The little X or check-mark by the \\"add to cart\\" is not always accurate.  I have a number of examples I can produce of check-marks that did not work, and Xs that did function.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire HD is a great device, but you (Amazon) need to offer developers incentives to make their apps Kindle compatible.  It is usually a very small coding issue that causes the problem.  I've even edited the code on a couple of apps myself to get them to run.  I am certain you (Amazon) could convince developers to do the same.  Nevertheless, I still love my Kindle Fire HD. It is a great tool.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I don't know how I missed this great series.  An outstanding cast, snappy, witty dialogue, great special effects.  Am looking forward to watching the follow-up movie, Serenity!
1581806574|4.0|A great opportunity to help my son who is interested in both fantasy and drawing to bring the two interests together
B005K2YTG4|5.0|Low-profile, easy to slip Kindle inside & protects it nicely in my son's backpack.  He prefers reading the Kindle without the added bulk of a case that stays on, so this works out perfectly.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|If you like Cronenberg, you'll love Cosmopolis. Giamatti is fantastic as always and Pattinson is surprising. Worth the time and money.
0590259385|5.0|I love the rhyming in this book, my grandson listens to the ryhme and tries to guess too! I love the hard cover and pages. Very durable,
B00026WU7I|4.0|I have to admit I don't like this album as much as I once did.  But I'm older now (like Bob) and the glibness of songs like \\"Idiot Wind\\" and \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\" tend to rub me the wrong way sometimes.  Doesn't mean there aren't absolute gems on this record.  \\"Buckets of Rain\\" and \\"Shelter from the Storm\\" are worth the price of admission.  Not Bob's absolute best, but pretty close.
B0000DD79B|5.0|Hello<br />  Simon and Garfunkel were 2 of the best with their music and lyrics...At one time their performances were all sold out...Barbara Cooper

B000002B30|5.0|Love listening to The Boss.  This album is a must for Springsteen fans.  Good selection of great hits to enjoy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run 2 is a good free game to download because it's really fun to play when your bored.
B000SEI230|5.0|Great book! better than the movie!  I love Nicholas Sparks, my favorite author . Just recently started reading his books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for little girls who adore horses. My sister plays this all day long. I really recommend it for all ages too.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game because I thought it would be like temple run, but it is much better, with a lot of objectives and vharecters. And you can compete with your friends for highscores!
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Harry Bosch character keeps evolving and Connelly keeps getting better. I can tell how good a book was by how sad I am to have it come to an end.
B00AATV046|5.0|I love this movie, and somehow my copy was lost. Needless to say I was very happy it was re-issued. Just a simpler time and puts me in the mood for the Holiday season, every-time I watch it!!
B000001DVV|5.0|When this band came out, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU, was freaking one of the best songs on t.v./radio.  15yrs later, it still Rocks!  The whole recording is great.  The band alone had talent, and then the 90's happened...nuff said?  No Thanks Nirvana, but I will give Dave G!  Props!
0446343129|4.0|very good read. informational and beneficial in general, and in particular to those who suffer from an ailment related to sugar consumption. fast delivery and good service.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Is this the best Bond ever, as some in the media have proclaimed? IMO, no. Is it even in top 5? Close. I'd put Casino Royale (the Daniel Craig version), Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, and From Russia With Love ahead of it. It's debatable whether Skyfall, Live & Let Die, For Your Eyes Only, Dr. No or Goldeneye should be next. Yup, for me it's that hard to decide. Each of those movies are terrific Bond movies, for different reasons. Regardless, Skyfall is one of the better Bond movies.<br /><br />Reading through the reviews, a lot of the 1-star and 2-star reviews seem to be focused on the lack of gadgets. Its rare to see someone argue that they think a Bond movie needs more gadgets! If you need gadgets, you should be happy with nearly all of the Brosnan Bond movies (esp Die Another Day) or Moonraker. If you note on my top Bond list only one of the movies I listed would qualify as having lots of \\"gadgets\\". I prefer my Bond to be more of a MacGyver, someone who uses the tools at hand rather than a deus ex machina solely geared toward helping him out of whatever trap he's in. In fact, several Bond movies (For Your Eyes Only, Goldeneye, Casino Royale) were purposely made in a way to get away from the gadgets that can otherwise dominate the show. I also prefer (generally) the Bond movies that are a little more 'down to earth' and don't have crazed megalomaniacs out to destroy the world (The Spy Who Loved Me being the lone exception). And while other low-starred reviewers decry the lack of action I prefer a breather every once in a while, not to mention a little plot development. If I wanted non-stop action I'd recommend sticking with Michael Bay films. No thanks!<br /><br />Instead, what do we have here? A Bond who has to make choices with consequences. He can't always save both England and the girl. As M and others have noted, Bond's women don't have a particularly good survival rate (5 out of 8 have died in the last 3 movies, by my count). And Bond isn't a superhero;he gets beat up & shot. Sure he wins the day but his body has taken some punishment. A villain who's not a maniac out to destroy the world or make a fortune but who has a very personal vendetta against MI6 and especially M with a well conceived plan to carry it out. Javier Bardem's a weird fellow, no doubt, but he does a good job as the villain. Some information on Bond's origins, which have always been a bit nebulous. I thoroughly enjoyed it and happily give it 5 stars.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Wonderful story line and it was worth every penny I paid for this series!!!!!<br />I loved everything about this series!!!

0811879542|3.0|The reviews on this book are through the roof.  Based on the reviews I ordered it.  While it is cover, I am not sure it had the wow factor I was hoping for.  I gave it as a gift and haven't had any feedback about it being one of the favorites.
B003YV64OI|5.0|Replaced my Phenom X4 processor with the AMD Athlon II X3. This processor fit my socket AM2+ with no issues. The computer runs very fast now. I even upgraded my video card and can now run the newer high graphic games with no performance issues. Best part, this processor is CHEAP! Well worth the buy.
B000ZP6MIY|4.0|excelente calidad los recomiendo son excelentes tienen suela anti resbalante y son totalmente cerrados adelante! especiales para cocineros, medicos y otras profesiones.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Paid for app. Graphics and game seemed great on preview. After I  downloaded the game it said I needed 600 additional man to play. Still have not been able to play. Totally dissatisfied. Don't waste your money.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I tried to download a powerpoint onto this and it didnt work at all.. a waste of time and money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really great game for horse lover's.  Very interactive and great graphics.  I would recommend it for kids and adults alike!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is probably one of the best apps ever. It's way better than the first because it's more responsive and has better graphics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun. I love why the character must run. I think this game is funny and creative. I play it every day.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|What a great album from beginning to end! A perfect example of what listeners can expect to hear from new and upcoming artists. A plethora of musical styles which capture a distinct quality of fine musicianship and respect for multiple genres overall. This album is a fresh must have for all music listeners in general. And with the Amazon price of $2.99 for the deluxe edition how can you afford not to own it! Fans of artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Prince & Lenny Kravitz will truly enjoy this album. Buy it and happy listening!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved every minute of reading this book. Mr. King is a brilliant writer. Never been disappointed in any of his books. Time travel is hard to expand on but he makes it look easy.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|love it I can posy it when I'm bored and cheers me up really really fun game . I think it is a really big upgrade from the first one
B002UXYD2Q|5.0|A very good movie, I recommend it to anyone who loves soldier movies. It's the best I've seen in awhile.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I was looking for a camp knife and this one fit the bill:<br />- 1/4&#34; thick<br />  - tough enough for the roughest jobs<br />Carbon Steel<br />  - easily sharpened<br />  - holds an edge<br />Blade less then 5-1/2&#34;<br />  - not considered a restricted weapon in TX<br />Sub $100<br />  - At $60 this is a steal<br />  - Can be 'used' not 'revered'.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Make pictures look like they were taken by a professional.<br />Great quality.<br />I would totally recommend this for people who love photography.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I use with my kindle fire hd, only downfall so far is that I have to unlock it when snoozing or dismissing the alarm used. Love that I can utilize multiple alarms for free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This  van  is so much more interesting than the 1st temple run. I find even like temple run ,but now I do. : )
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story was great, love where this story is heading.  Thought the tributes would stand up to the capitol, will have to wait and see what happens in the last book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was amazing, I couldn't put it down. Great characters and a gripping storyline that keeps you guessing until the very end.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I like search games.  this one has an interesting story plot that sends you through the town.  some screens are easy and others make you really have to look. the shapes you have to look for can be a challenge.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so amazing! I will totally be reading it again. Colleen Hoover you done it again! Looking forward to your next book :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a page turner.  It was well written in both the perspectives of the two main characters alternating back and forth, showing that every story has two sides, and things are never as they seem.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book actually tells you really good information that will help you in the future. I've actually have built up enough courage from this book to talk to a girl that I have never talk to and that I think highly of.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Arrived quickly and safely packaged. We watched all of the DVDs very fast and they worked without a hitch. Highly recommended:)
B006XOBFJC|5.0|An 80's studio recording that had amazing sound quality and consistent peformances between operas. A suprisingly good value that is more than worth its cost and the time invested in listening for more than 14 hours.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|. This game was adventurous and fun I loved it. I love games like this can't wait for the second one!
B003Z6WFWC|3.0|I watched with my son. He was to watch it for a school assignment.  I liked it and understood the reason for the scene with the hanging body but I think the sex scene could have been left out.
B00846REIS|4.0|I initially didn't care for this book after reading the 50 Shades series, however, after re-reading the first book at a later time I did grow to like it as an individual series.  It's an interesting story with decent character development and steamy sex scenes.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great for quiet times all will enjoy very much fun works the mind and memory great for all ages adult s and kids 1-100 worth the money
B007712XAU|1.0|To the people who wrote reviews:  Thanks for clearing up the mystery for me of why so much was missing!  Of course, the Christmas Special is part of Season 2 and should have been included. This is a blatant rip-off.
B008OCTMRS|5.0|album art is beautiful the layout if amazing......the sound is so awesome.... if you love vinyl get this i love hearing the new songs they sound so much better than cd or digital download... you can hear the instruments better and Michael Jackson's voice is so crisp and clear......the price is right for this vinyl.... but it
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This really isn't a James Bond movie: it's a bad action movie with the James Bond brand attached.  Even the action sequences are boring.  I've seen better Jean-Claude Van Damme films.  Even the obligatory hot chicks are boring.<br /><br />Look, I know you're going to watch it anyway, just because it got such great reviews and made a bazillion dollars at the box office.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My kids love the movie. Kids will enjoy the bright colors and funny! funny! The songs are very upbeat and fun
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Good for drowning out my spouse's snoring.  The wide variety of sounds are great for insomnia.  Haven't used it, yet, for general relaxation, but I know there will be a tune or sound available.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Help me on my math work for school when i did not have a caculator .Works great with advanced math to.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved these books even though they were a little redundant at times in the sex scenes the plot was wonderful. I was always on the edge of my seat reading these books. I read them so quickly and kept wanting more. Book two was much better than the first. I laughed, cried, had fear, and rage go through my buddy as I took the emotional journey with the characters. I loved this!!!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|My teenage daughter of course loves this series. The local store was sold out before the holidays. So I picked it up on here, for much less too. BNIP. She loves it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|fast moving.  always kept my interest.Would like to see more books continuing the story line.Hope the rumors of a fouth book hold true.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i absolutely love it! seriously buy it so much better then the first one!! definitely going to play thus all the time!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Haven't had a problem with the app graphics are clear and you actually interact with the horse(s). Nice for kids and young adults really teaches responsibility.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|I love Donna she is the 70's diva and I do love her music. I am ver happy with it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I ordered this game as a family gift, in the hopes that it would get all of us spending more quality time together.  I thought it might be a struggle to get a 13 year old boy to even be interested in playing, but had read so many good reviews, it seemed worth a try.  I couldn't be more surprised or impressed.  Even after over a month of having this game, he still asks to play it nearly every night!  We have some minor problems getting the frame pieces of the board to lay flat, which we solved by putting magnets on the top and bottom, but otherwise everything has held up well and been of excellent quality.  I'm so encouraged by how well Catan has gone over that I'm now looking into bringing more board games into the house so we can set up our own family &#34;games night&#34;.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Love love the famous Bee Gees and I love the music on this CD. I am very pleased with it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I am so in love with this horse and its achievements. The determination was impeccable and the horse really had a mind of its own. I have reviewed footage of the real Secretariat and it is mind boggling at the strength and the stamina this athlete showed when presented with the chance. This horse love the challenge of coming from behind to win a race, and did it without being prodded...As for the owner, Mrs. Tweedy was incredibly confident for a women in this genre of athleticism. A statement made &#34;she took on the old boys and won&#34; was exactly what happened. Her own husband doubted her ability to handle her father's business and win the way she did. Her belief in the horse's ability to do its job formed a bond between horse and owner that surpassed any form of trust known to man. I believe the horse ran not only because it loved to run, but because Mrs. Tweedy acknowledged the horse for who it was, like a mother to a child......Very good movie and the product was in good shape....for that fact I still watch the movie......love it to death
B009YP9L7U|5.0|At first it took me time to get into this book.. once I did I couldn't put it down.....good book well written
B0002XV30Q|5.0|This is a wonderful way to collect a major portion of the composer's output at an extremely reasonable price.  All of the concertos are 'crowd pleasers' with brilliant pianism and lovely melodic content.  My favorite is the Fourth Concerto.  There are other individual recordings of these works that could, arguably, be 'preferred' but as a collection,  Collard and the conductor, Previn, prove to be fine team to advocate for these concertos and the filler pieces.
B007WA56SC|5.0|This is Kylie's best for sure, all her great songs and a few great older songs that she does so well, she is very upbeat to listen too and i just love her voice.....she can get you in a great mood and make you feel like dancing with her....and i would never compare her to Madonna, she is much better and has her own style, so if you are looking for some great music to listen to or to work out to, or while driving somewhere or for your mp3, you will love her!!!!!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Great Deal on cd's and dvd's, I get all my cd's and dvd's shopping done in one shot on Amazon, and always at a good price.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The games story is entriguing. the controls are easy.  played wellover fours hours before I realized it.Worked flawlessy on my kindle fire hd
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Another great hidden object game from Artifex Mundi. There's are always well done with great video sequences and pretty good stories.<br /><br />G5, on the other hand, has deceptive marketing practices since they do not make clear that &quot;free&quot; only applies to the download and playing a scene or two. In this day, &quot;free&quot; is often assumed to mean &quot;ad supported&quot; and they should make clear that their &quot;free&quot; means only &quot;download and trial&quot;.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|I've just finished listening to this album for the second time after downloading it this morning (it's 10am now). I've also had to run the mp3 files through Roxio to lower the volume levels 70% across the board to eliminate distortion at peak volumes (there are a lot of them in Wagner). It's not difficult, just a half hour of annoying work and shouldn't be necessary. I don't know if Amazon or Decca is at fault here. Also, there's no reason why a digital booklet isn't included with track listings and texts, especially since the second part of the Lohengrin Grail Narrative is impossible to find. I suppose I could spend a few hours taking it down by ear and translating myself....but that kind of work should earn me about $75 an hour!<br /><br />As to the performance itself, I can't add any superlatives that my e-colleagues, particularly Ralph, Grady and Santa, haven't already posted. This is consistently gorgeous, heartfelt singing that proves Kaufmann to be not just the foremost tenor of our time, but one of the great singers of all time.<br /><br />Donald Runnicles has never been a great favorite of mine, but I was VERY impressed with id Ring Cycle at San Francisco in 2011. His work here is more than adequate but never obtrusive or inspired. But again I am baffled by the choice to use rather abrupt endings rather than the usual more satisfying concert endings for many of these selections. With five minutes of blank time on the disc, there's not really any excuse.<br /><br />I suppose I should have given this four stars, but that would only apply to the mp3 version. I certainly hope there are no sound problems on the CD!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome so cool that it changes after a while.but what I really want amazon to get is clash of clans.already got it on iphone5
B008OOYALE|5.0|Lots of fun - pretty and colorful. My children and I play this game together. Thanks for creating such a sweet app that is easy enough for my five year old but still entertaining enough for my 14 year old.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|Ultavox nailed it, every cut a hit and the engineering is outstanding.  Please tour in the south of USA, I will be there
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I think this dictionary is very useful to search words ;) it is helpful to look up words :-) I love t this dictionary!!!!
B009P5S11G|2.0|Rihanna is an artist who's career has been the epitome of what is grotesquely wrong with pop music and celebrity... but has  also simultaneously been at the cutting edge of the pop music avant garde! Like a beautiful flower, or maybe a car crash....one simply can't look away! Due in part to her pure raw guts and the master studio wizards behind her, she has churned out some real crass but addictive jams...such as cockiness. While the aforementioned track was quite a winner, this is the fourth rihanna record in four years. At this point we can see that the product is being a bit rushed....a regurgitation of the crude pop falls miserably flat on multiple occasions...with the exception of phresh of the runway which almost sounds like she stole part of the hook from the classic television show, the Flintstones. So much of this disc just screams lazy and rehased, from the weak sampling of pony on \\"jump\\" accompanied by her limp vocals.  A majority of the dance pop on here completely lacks melody and is about as pleasurable as having meth injected into you while at the dentists office. Tracks bleed into eachother like a bad ulcer. Beyond the material that would be better suited in a garbage bin...we do have several exceptionally lovely ballads! Diamonds was interesting the first 100 times it was played on the radio...stay perhaps has much more to it lyrically than one would expect (hint: it might not be about a lover), and love without tragedy steals the show...however rihannas repetition of how she was struck by love seems ill advised considering the circumstances and the overall message of the song.....and considering she didn't write it. And speaking of ill advised, don't even get me started on numb, which would be a fire hot club jam if it didn't have eminem yelling at rihanna in a somewhat verbally abusive manner. The listener is pelted constantly with references to the incident but it is seemingly always framed in the most unhealthy way possible. Good or bad...rightor wrong....this is pop music at it's most cutting edge and current. What in the world could she do next?
B007R0Y7VO|4.0|Interesting story. The lives that are touched by this horse are many. We never know when our paths will cross again
B002WQZHJO|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent video quality from Amazon Prime. This is why I continue downloading and purchasing my movies here! This movie is a Must Have for your collection, especially for you Denzel fans...
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Still great after all these years. Alan Parsons really touched this album to make it the greatest Pink Floyd album
B009GXHOW4|3.0|someone plz help I put animals on now I can't get them off. I don't see what it does, someone plz help!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Parts are funny, but after awhile the language gets old. Flash Gordon seems to steal the moive, and he's on drugs. Could be better!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I thought that this book was a sensation and I loved every minute of it!!!!!:)<br />I would recommend this story to every person who craves a mischievous<br />Characters story and adventures
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun to use. Great for free. Pass the advertisements<br />I love these card game<br />enjoy the use of it every day
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is a great book.  The ending kind of leaves you hanging but overall great!  I would recommend this book.
0440238153|5.0|This whole series is thought-provoking.  A lot of people think it's strictly Anti-Christian.  I feel like it's more so anti-religious corruption.  It's good to expand the mind and think about the underlying themes.
B00932HEX2|1.0|I just watched 2/3 of season one.  What have I learned so far?  America is a bad, bad country.  Evil CIA.  Evil military.  Evil FBI.  Evil Vice President.  But terrorists are really great people who are just misunderstood.  If only they had the chance to torture more Americans we'd all realize just how great they are.  Other than that inspiring message and lots of nudity there's really nothing here.
B007QJAIUA|4.0|This movie really appeals to the college-age set, because it features a multi-cultural group of foreign students in Spain. My only peeve--which I never got past--was how unattractive the main character Xavier is--both in looks and personality.<br />While I admire French film directors for often casting physical unattractive men as love interests,  I just couldn't buy that any woman would be interested in a boring, sexist Cro-magnon who is really mean to his mother for no justifiable reason.  I guess the character is a typical self-absorbed writer, who hates the world and doesn't see his own flaws.<br />I LOVED the Belgian character, and that hot Italian man who didn't say much but didn't need to.  Ooh la la.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is a wonderful and unique love story, well told. Great imagination and literacy. Very capturing and highly recommended to all.
B003QWRA3Y|5.0|great movie did not expect it and was very interesting once you were drawn in you could not tear away
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|thanks a lot gameloft just wated 7 bucks on a stupid game because of all the memory. you guys are really nice. take some space off the app gameloft<br /><br />.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I also have this on my phone and computer and don't use it that much. it is boring now with a the other card games
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought a slow start, but I kept reading.<br />The last half of book was incredibly wild!!!  Breathe-taking!!!!  Very full of suspense.  And it transported me to the scene.  I swear my surroundings would quiet when Jules was all alone.<br />Really good book!!!
B000001FDK|5.0|Watched it over 20 times so far!  Great old movie that brings the 50`s back to life.  A must see!
1582406723|5.0|Another book to add to my collection. Couldnt put it down til i read it all. which didnt take long but lets me move on to the next.
B000002J6F|5.0|Bill Wyman plays on (The Raven) a. Rock & Roll Crazies b. Cuban Bluegrass and is coauthor with Stills of (Consider) The Love Gangster. I presume that he plays too in this last song.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Cubistry has a lot of similarities to mah johnng, without the frustrations of weird tilesets. The three-dimensional layout leads to unusual strategies, and you can focus on trying to improve your time. More than worth the price.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|was on level 11 when it decided to &quot;start over &quot; lost everything... but that's my fault I didn't back up. so back yours up. otherwise fun and entertaining for all ages. disable in app purchases if you let kids play unsupervised.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun and easy to figure out. I enjoy the competitions and simplicity of games. my 5 year old can figure it out as well.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I got this game and it was so hard and stupid because u could play online and also the graphics sucked.
0385535147|2.0|In the acknowledgements at the end of this book the writer notes that he is not an expert on the subject matter, that he did not do any research, and that he did not consult with any experts in the writing or fact checking of this book. Just lazy, frankly, and insulting. And despite the fact that he has always had the ability to spin a good story, the writing here is not interesting or crafty or clever, the adjectives predictable and cliched. I'm sure Mr. Grisham laughs all the way to the bank, people still buying his books long after the franchise has lost its luster.
0307887960|1.0|Just another book.  Thought that it would be more.  It may have worked for the Dutchess In England but not for me....
B0050SYS5A|3.0|It works to an extent. A little difficult to set up but if you follow the instructions you'll be fine. It works but doesn't allow for such a small area as they claim.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I purchased this kit so I could use it with my I Pad to be able to scan<br />the pictures I have taken with my Wildlife camera!<br />Due to the fact I have a protective case on the I Pa I can't and haven't<br />been able to put out into the plug . I'm not going to damage the case<br />so I'm unable to use it at all.<br />The plug extending further from the body or an extension cord would have<br />nice and very useful.<br />So far the purchase is a waste of money!
B00ALKPTFA|5.0|This is a book tha one should read with open mind and ready to look insed himself, really willing to change.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Excellent twists/turns. The story kept me guessing all the way to the end, in true Harry Bosch fashion. Loved it!.
1451638450|4.0|After Cryoburn I was prepared to be disappointed but I was very pleased with this story! I always loved Ivan. I knew with a mother as smart as Lady Alys \\"Ivan, you idiot!\\" was mostly an act. Ivan's motivation has always been to fly as far under the radar as possible. In this story we are shown why. Should something happen to The Gregor Ivan would be a much more palatable (to the Barrayarans)choice than Miles ever could have been. Gregor was carefully prepared for his burden. Ivan is quite aware the burden is beyond his capabilities. Bujold has brilliantly saved Ivan from this fate and given him a beautiful future. What a perfect end to the Barrayran Tale. I hope no one persuades her to improve on perfection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is very good. It was spook great. I would read it over and over and over again it was such a great book
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this CD for my first time.  I like all kinds of music and this is definitely not what I would normally listen to, but a nice addition to my collection.
034580404X|2.0|I finally had the chance to open the fifty shades of grey boxset I ordered and begin to read them, imagine my dissapointment to find that the very first book in the series was missing and instead contained book 2 and 2 of book 3. I was not at all pleased and quire unhappy about this to say the least. I was also quite surprised considering I have never encountered a problem with anything I purchased from Amazon before now and do not know how to proceed to remedy this unfortunate situation. I will be a little more leary with future purchases.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game embodies two important lessons for game developers:<br />1) Simple can still be extremely effective and appealing.<br />2) Incorporate feedback to increase the appeal of your product.<br /><br />Point #2 first: This is my inference from reading older reviews. For example, it *is* now possible to turn off the music independently from the sound effects. (Lesson to app buyers: not everything in reviews may still be accurate.)<br /><br />There is a similar game that I still like very much, Fairy Mahjong 3D, which is much more complex (e.g., different levels with different cubes and layouts.)  Cubistry takes the cube-matching concept down to the very basics: You have an array of brightly colored cubes, and must removing matching cubes (in Cubistry, in pairs) in order to clear the board.  Swiping allows you to rotate the array as needed.<br /><br />In Cubistry, the starting array in \\"puzzle mode\\" is always a solid 6x6x6 cube, and the same cube patterns (of which there are many, probably circa 30) appear all the time. The objective is to clear the board as quickly as possible. (There is also point scoring, which I haven't bothered to figure out.)  This remains challenging and avoids monotony because as you remove pairs, you are essentially changing the layout of the cubes; while the mechanics remain the same, you aren't getting exactly the same game over and over.<br /><br />Cubistry additionally has a \\"Cube Attack\\" mode. You start off with a few pairs of cubes, but more cubes are added approximately every half second (often blocking a pair that you were selecting) to eventually fill a solid cubic array. The objective in this mode is to play for as long as you can.  A nice touch is that the cubes are added in pairs (although in multiple pairs), so there's no chance of having unmatchable cubes.<br /><br />Graphics are distinct and aesthetically pleasing, and the controls for cube selection and rotating the array work well--this game should be as effective on a phone's small screen as it is on my 7\\" Kindle Fire. The music and sound effects are uninspired, but not offensive, and can be turned off separately or in tandem.<br /><br />Cubistry is a much-better-than-usual FAOTD, and is well worth the 99 cents when it is not the free app of the day.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side arrived before the expected time estimated. The DVD was well protected and was without defects to the DVD.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Love how compact the box is so I dont give up real estate in my cabinet but love all the discs...they sound amazing in my home theater.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I had 50million coins and the next day I get on I have zero coins this game is a waist of storage do not get this app
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Anyone who hasn't tried this game is missing out on a great concept. Lots of replay value in that once you beat it there are tons of repeatable levels you can play.
B00AFEY354|4.0|Appreciated the most the focus stayed on the subject. You root for him after you get to know him. Dislikes is there was not much new for this genre of movie but would probably pick this one over the popular ones in the past. Wait for used ones in new condition to come out.
0312427646|5.0|Adjectives of this sort naturally spring to mind.  The Uncommon Reader is a very fast read.  And a very amusing one.  It's not an extraordinary piece of literature.  But it is a well-polished piece of satire.  If you like wry humor, you'll love it.  Why did 1-star readers bother reading past the first chapter?  If the first few pages don't hook you, the next 100+ will likely fail to as well.  If, on the other hand, the opening pages have you chuckling, then settle in for an hour or so.  You'll be happy you did.  The Uncommon Reader has all the charms of a BBC comedy of manners.  Charming this little book is, in spades.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you love faced paced, endless games, this is for you. It is very addicting and if you are bored, this can supply you with hours of entertainment.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|I had heard Breezeblocks on the radio and liked the unique sound of the band.  After checking out the reviews I was curious about the rest of the album.  It is definitely unlike anything I have heard before.  I really enjoy the new sound of a unique band.  Something about their music soothes me.  I would recommend this if you are looking for something out of the box.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|LOVED SO MUCH!!!!!!!! This book is so well written and so real! I could feel every emotion that Pat and his family were feeling. I could not put it down! I literally read it in a day! I laughed, cried, then laughed some more. I also enjoy football, so the Eagles connection was fun to see played out. I had hoped the movie would be as good, but just as with most books to movies, it wasn't. But still good. I have recommended this book to all of my friends!
B0093OGBL6|1.0|Horrible writing. Repetitious phasing and shallow story. Can't understand what the point of the book is. other than trying to make Michael Jackson worthy of sainthood. Not worth reading.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I really like getting my DVD's through Amazon.  The price is always right and I don't have to wait forever to receive my order.<br /><br />As for this particular movie, it was a pretty accurate depiction of the mindset back in the days of prohibition. Lots of action, blood and violence.  I'm not too keen on the latter, but that's the way it was back then.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|aside from the occasional &#34;scenes&#34; it has a pretty boring storyline like the first two, except this was more vomit worthy with all the lovey dovey nicknames used in this one. I only read it because I had already have it and was just bored.
B0096BIENY|5.0|great item i couldn't find in my own country.the voice of the tenors is marvellous and the atmosphere is out of this world
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with the other books in this series, its a great read and I would recommend to anyone. I read this book in a day!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I am a big fan of the Virtual City series of games and this one is no different. For an online simulation game, gameplay is smooth, easy, and reminiscent of the stand alone versions.  It could use some tweaking in the area of building pricing and money accumulation. Some of the buildings, such as the theater, could be lower priced to help with quicker quest completion. To offset the prices,  money earnings could come faster.  Otherwise, the game is )16addicting and well done!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Interesting at first, but overall not a great storyline. The only interesting thing about this book is the &#34;scenes&#34; but I can predict it getting pretty repetitive after awhile.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is fun and addictive. I enjoy taking turns playing this with my children. We challenge each other skills.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As with the other books in this series, its a great read and I would recommend to anyone. I read this book in a day!
B0060FXBNM|3.0|I am semi disappointed in this collection. In short it is all three movies in very basic Blue Ray cases inside a cardboard case. the movies look like they were part of a set of 2 discs due to the first movies disc saying disc 1. they have very minimal special features. nothing for a movie fanatic. If you want just the movies here ya go. If you want a ultimate collection look elsewhere
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It wasn't what I expected. Its written differently and that made it interesting, but all the high ratings this book got, I thought it would be better. I was kinda bored in parts. Its more of a book used for reading for English class.
B009FXIICK|5.0|dont play this if you like fun addicting games. I loved this game it is very reminiscent of bejeweled. and cute
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I can start to feel the storyline getting worse by the chapter. Its a pretty boring read, I don't think I want to read the third book of this.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|Our Read n share book club recently read this book with mixed reviews. I like history presented in a novel.  It showed many facets of life in the 17th century in a country that was in its golden age.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The story was good, there was some boring parts, but mostly a good read. I would recommend reading it too.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Love it..gets u hooked immiediatly. The most addicting game I've downloaded since angry birds. And the price is right. Get it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! would recommend to anyone! I had to get the second book right away, it was too good to wait another minute!
B0045HCJGC|4.0|I have wanted this movie for quite a while it is dorky but the car is awsome and muscular even more than Sly
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was a surprisingly a good book, I read it pretty quickly and that's when I know I really like the book!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This is Robert Downey at his best well close there is Iron Man and Avengers all are great and I have them all
B00881VLCE|5.0|What fun it is to figure out which piece goes where.  I gives me a chance to use my eye/hand coordination and my memory.  Always fun to see the finished product.  Great choice of puzzles.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|I would recomend this to any Robert Downey or Jude Law fan they work well together and the story lines are good
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I get so many different ideas from here, from crafts to cleaning  to home projects to humor.  I love creating boards to organize what I want to investigate.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|Spooky film, typical horror movie. Probably ok if your in the mood for a movie of this type. Only feel asleep once ...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Our family is addicted to all the Angry bird games.  Time sure does fly by when playing them.  My 7 year old even loves it and is better at it then I am.  ha ha
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so much fun it is so adicting. I can not stop playing this game someone help me get away from this app.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|The movie was a bit slow going with no real action scenes that I have come to expect from the Bourne Series. Since I enjoyed the first three I thought this would be of the same caliber. While it does explain the science and maybe ties the first three Bourne movies together, it was rather unnecessary and only real purpose was to bank on the success of the Bourne franchise. I really wish I would have rented this instead of buying it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|If you like mahjong you will like this game. It is a different perspective. Get it it is fun. You will enjoy
B009JBZH54|5.0|The picture and audio quality of these Blu-rays is perfect.  Be sure to watch the documentary about the Bat mobile on the Dark Knight Rises Extras Blu-ray.
1423113462|5.0|The greatest strength of The Lost Hero is that it kept the plot moving quickly all the time, even parts you would think would be boring. For instance, at a part where Leo is explaining about something non-exciting, suddenly the dragon that they are riding falls and crashes into a warehouse full of Cyclopes.<br />  Another strength of this book is that the characters and settings all have great descriptions and it really feels like you are in the place the book is describing. An example that shows the description of characters is that you feel as if Jason, Piper and Leo are kids you actually know, not just fictional people in a book. You can almost predict the choices they will make.<br /> Some weaknesses of The Lost Hero are that it is heavy with Greek mythology. Some things explain themselves, but others you need to know a bit about the basics of the major gods to understand. For instance, most people have not heard of Boreas, the god of winter and one of the four directional winds, but they probably know Aphrodite, Poseidon, Zeus, etc...<br /> Also troubling in this book is that there is a cliffhanger at the end. We still do not know what happened to Percy Jackson, the \\"lost hero\\" that the title is referring to. I suppose this might be a good thing, because now I want to read the second book.<br /> Rick Riordan wrote this book to entertain young adults and teens. The characters are the around the same age as his audience, and they too have problems, like ADHD and getting in lots of trouble. He was effective in his purpose, because he definitely entertained me. I think many of his fans enjoyed the Percy Jackson series, and when the last book came out, he wanted to start another series that ties in with the old one.<br /> I definitely recommend this book to others, because it is a great story with an exciting plot and characters. It played on my emotions. There are parts where I was sad, scared, angry, excited and even confused, just like the characters. I like theway he lightens the mood with humor, even when the world is going to end. Anyone who liked the Percy Jackson books will love this one. I know my next read will be the second book of the series, Son of Neptune.
B0013FBS20|5.0|The picture and audio quality of this Blu-Ray was perfect.  I already owned this on Blu-ray but the quality was bad.  This disk has almost perfect Audio and Video.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I truly love this game and i have read alot about things like neather, abandoned mines, and ruins, even zombiepigs and snowmen made to help you!!! But this is all sadly on Pc and X.Box 306 so i really cant get to them. I would love if you would do a few of these things to make this better Monjang. :)<br />1:Hardcore mode<br />2:Swapaboe modes<br />3:more land per world<br />4: Everything neather, ruins, and abandoned shafts<br />5:Predators that can kill you (i mean living real animals if you read that creative)<br />6: A way to learn how to play.<br />If you where to add all of this up, this will be the greatest app in history!!! (To me i love it but it really needs those in that list)
0374532281|5.0|Really loved this book! Had no expectations going in but was quickly immersed in the story because of the endearing outlook/perspective of the main character, Pat. I loved all the characters and the relationships in this book. If you are looking for an easy read, with a good story and good characters, this is a great choice.
B005LAII3A|5.0|This DVD arrived super fast! Was brand new and a perfect quality of a great movie that did the genre justice on a classic,buy it with confidence.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This minecraft is awesome because  my friends  told me to play it on the computer and it was awesome  so I bought it on my kindle fire.
0143113100|5.0|On the one hand, this book takes you to a trip of stories behind the most fascinating developments and insights about our brain - and our abilities. How they are developed and how they are lost.<br />It might also help practices of brain.<br />Even though it is built as stories, and thus is suspected as anecdotal, it is also heavily based on research, and its stories are really from the frontiers.<br />The brain is extremely dynamic, as it becomes more and more apparent. It is less fixed by our genes, and more from our use of it. It is amazing how much we can change and develop it. Yet no easy shortcuts.<br />One caveat mentioned by earlier readers worth stressing - after reading this book, people might develop non-realistic hopes. Things are not that easy. While this warning should be in the readers' mind, I still highly recommend reading this book. Still 5 stars.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|The movie actually got to me before the expected date. So that was very nice for me. Made me have a great day
B009EEFTMC|1.0|I click on the buttons and nothing happens all they do is highlight so I'm confused on how to even start the game
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I don't read books because they're popular.  I read books because they're good.  This is as fast passed as the show and just as witty.  I wasn't disappointed with the writing, although the editing slipped a few times.  I don't feel like I wasted any of my precious free time.
B002Z58GQI|4.0|It does the work, and it has a lifetime warranty, but the manufacturers have retired the backward compatibility of this product with old versions of Windows like Windows 95, 98, 98 SE, and ME. The previous version of this product used to have the drivers for such legacy OSes. So, if you are not into this predicament, it is a good product.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I almost cried when he told her that everything was a joke and even though I knew it was real. I just loved this book. Simone is  a very talented writer.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|App is a little slower than what I am used to. Generally speaking tho, if your computer off or not available, and you left your IPad home, or in another room, this app will be ready to perform for you.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is fabulous. Yes there are pop ups and all but that's just them trying to get some revenue. After all, the game is FREE. I love it. :)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Kudos to the author. This part of history was related in such a way I felt like I was along for the ride. Could not put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game fun not to hard. But lost all my progress for no reason that pissed me off. Other wise its a fun game
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I used this on my Kindle, its greats and works as design. I use it to search on anything that comes to mind
B001QB9H10|5.0|A fun B movie....mindless and violent.....Jason Stratham sure isn't Richard Burton but he's one tough character in all his movies.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|LinkedIn app on Kindle fire works well. I use to keep track of my network when I am away from my main computer all the key features are available and it turns out to be a good tool.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like it more than the Hunger Games because I think it has more suspense. It also had a lot of action.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I used this app on my kindle fire HD, the app is adequate, however for me the search feature is a little awkward, In addition I would like a feature to sign in to my YouTube account with this version and to save my favorite video. With these thing said the price is right. It does the job and i use it a lot.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|READ THIS! guess what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  angry birds is angry birds why do u guys have to have it like outer space looking or star wars. I have one game of angry birds. you don't need all the different kinds. there the same! its just that it like looks different! I'm not spending 2.99 $ on this game when u can get it for free as the original. Ps angry birds is a very fun game but u don't need all the kinds. but go ahead buy this. if u really want to.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|For a Free app it gets the job done, I use it to store quick note on the Kindle. If your need more features than just notes I suggest you use something else to match your particular concerns
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Omg! I was hooked from the first page. I fell in love when hope did and i felt hopes pain. She was so strong
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I haven't quite finished the last disc yet, but this season has surpassed the last three.  Great creative writing.  Can't wait for season 5 to come out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely fun and allows you to show off your skill to your friends and family through facebook its the perfect example of a great game
B004SBX112|4.0|Even though my new tablet came with Star Wars installed, I wanted to play Seasons first.  It's been great so far--maybe a little tougher than the original.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Quick download and install on my kindle fire. As another player said it is just like making. It may be a little better in that it has choices for games. It allows you to set the clock on or off. With all the bright Colorado and markings it is very easy to getlost/confused. Fun game that is worth taking a look at. You will pass many hours quickly while playing. This is a game circle game.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I'm glad I didn't watch the series on TV.  An exciting show with a great plot and gifted actors. This way I get to watch at my own pace.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I enjoy Youtube and I have had no problems with this app, it simply does what I want it to do.  Nothing fancy, just get me videos as I want them and look for them.
B0045DO932|5.0|Love this album. Bought this one for my daughter because it was a cleaner version than the one I had.Many awesome songs on this. Well worth the money.
1616550414|3.0|Just for those of you buying this specifically for a collection of Zelda artwork, don't. It's more like a compendium on the series, and it's not really all that great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is one of the most popular games ever.<br />I love it but I think that it needs more information about the horse.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is amazing! Just amazing! It changed my life, since I'm too young to have Twitter and Facebook this just like it!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I am so happy i ordered this movie.  It was well worth it.  This story about a homeless, basically abandoned young man who was taken in by a family who nurtured his talents and intelligence is truly heart warming.  It is even more special because it is a true story.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Was good but cost $4.99 too short for that kind of money. Did have good story. Games could have been harder. Good for beginners but still too short. Would like more difficult games/puzzles. More objects in hidden puzzles scenes.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|great book to read. it is a little short though but still great. it is a little over priced though.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This movie is a well scripted re-envisioning of the original series and characters.  Therefore while there is some overlap, it's not simply a regurgitation; it's a completely different, alternate universe, yet as an original fan, I think they captured the spirit of Rodenberry's first vision and characters very, very well.  The Romulans are fierce, there are no reformulated Klingons (something I never liked, they were clearly the bad guys to start with and the Romulans were fearful and ruthless but honorable, i don't like that they messed with that in later TV sequels), and the chemistry between the crew on the bridge is perfect.  Well cast, well written, well produced, and well directed, assuming this trend continues, I can't wait for Start Trek II to hit the theaters in 2013; I will be first in line.  Kudos to JJ Abrams who is second only to Sam Raimi in my book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun and and entertaining game because you get to run and jump and get. Coins it's kind of like temple run
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I don't give out five stars easily, so this says a lot. I was not expecting much from the book as it was a debut novel, but I was incredibly, pleasantly surprised that Before I Go to Sleep is SJ Watson's first novel. I was not surprised to learn it is in development to be adapted into a movie. A little more research told me that this book had been highly reviewed in Booklist and Kirkus. It has what a story needs to make it a blockbuster, as long as Hollywood doesn't tweak it too much.<br /><br />It begins with Christine waking up in a stranger's bed, unsure of how she got there. She believes she is in her 20's. But soon she learns that her bed mate is not a stranger, but is instead her husband Ben, that she is middle aged and doesn't remember a thing from the last 20 or so years. She has a very rare form of amnesia, and day-to-day memories are lost. She slowly processes all this, finding a journal that she writes to herself every day to help her remember. And the biggest shocker in this journal? A note written to herself with the pronunciation--\\"Don't Trust Ben!\\"<br /><br />Readers unravel the mystery the same way Christine does, with the help of her journal. Every day she starts from square one, discovering what she has learned the days and weeks before with the help of her journal. You start to question reality and how we look at it. What is reality? Is it what people believe goes on or is it what really goes on? Is it the public face we put on or is it what goes on behind closed doors? And do we really want to know what goes on behind closed doors or are we happy with the reality we have created for our friends, our neighbors, ourselves?<br /><br /> This read, and the ride it takes us on, is mesmerizing and exciting, thrilling and gripping. The end does not disappoint. I highly recommend this book, and look forward to more books by Watson.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|All i think you need to fix is the lag in subway surfers thats all. And mabe add morestuff. One more thing is ad more modivation inthe game that will make it the best.
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|very action packed  and great scenery . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I've loved this book for a very long time! No matter what else I may get heavily into I always come back to this one. Even if you're not into fantasy.. you'll love it.
B00542USJW|4.0|Un clásico para los amantes de los looney toons y el basket. Recomendado para coleccionistas. Para reirse un buen rato.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It is a great teacher. It will definitely be of good. Thanks for including it in the book store.<br />Thanks.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  I felt like I was inside the book at times.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Lots of action, but if you like strong smart woman characters, this move will annoy you badly. The original Taken was a better film overall. Main female characters did not learn much from last kidnapping that happened. Liam is just as powerful, in this role, His daughter is better but now you will understand why he divorced his shallow / insanely dim-witted wife.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch.. I enjoyed the soundtrack and caught myself singing along a few times.  If you like classic rock, you will enjoy this.
B00170I7GG|5.0|We watch Christmas movies at Christmas, horror movies at Halloween and this is our annual Ground Hogs Day movie.  It's a cute story and Bill Murray is great as usual.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is a great series, to add to the existing line of Batman Movies.  The antagonists in all the films are great!  The Joker is hilarious with all his crazy remarks, and Bane...., well Bane is just a bad @$$.  This is a must have to everyone's movie collection.
0446585041|1.0|I cannot wait to become famous so I can write a \\"book\\" of scattered thoughts and drawings to color so I can have it published and sell millions of copies.  If I used that as my opening line, it would be more substantial than what was in this book.  Do I like Ellen?, YES I DO!  Do I ever want to waste my hard earned money and time to read someone's disjointed stream of consciousness...NO!  In one chapter she has fakfjgdifjd with a \\"whoops, I had my hands on the wrong keys\\", another was just drawings to color, which was very annoying since it was the Kindle addition.  Her ramblings in her standup are very funny, but in a book, not so much.  There were some amusing things, after all, she is Ellen, but this book seemed more like a home work project she didn't want to do.  I hope in the end of the book she didn't reveal the secrets of the universe because I stopped reading in the middle of the book.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Okay, I have reviewed many albums on other websites. But people's unfounded bashing of this one demanded me to come here and tell you the truth, OBJECTIVELY. Now, there are many disgruntled ELO fans here spreading their misery about the band's breakup upmteen years ago. I am not here to talk about that. I was born in 1985, way, WAY after most of the hits that graced this album fell off the charts. Heck, I am younger than both of Jeff's daughters.<br /><br />The truth? Let's not take away from what Jeff Lynne has done here. He has taken old (yes, I said old), dried out tunes and reinvigorated them with today's production equipment. I hear a lot of \\"this album sounds like the originals\\". Um, no. I have had over a decade of music training and I can say with conviction that they don't. There are many intricacies that you could never hear before that you can now. Bass comes out clean as it should. Synth overlays don't control the song. The production is cleaner and brighter, which is EXACTLY what Jeff was trying to accomplish.  Vocals shine above the drums, and man, for a 64 year old dude, he sounds incredible. We should all be grateful that Jeff has done us a favor and brought out the original intentions of the music. How dare we complain about that?<br /><br />I encourage anyone that has been put off by the reviews to buy this CD immediately. Don't listen to the noise-Mr. Blue Sky totally NAILED IT.
B009B0L324|4.0|Same songs but well digitized, real rocks the new car stereo. The live songs are great, and seems AC/DC never ages.
B00136S0NE|5.0|these two are great together. One can certainly imagine this happening, even the fact that they actually wrote the tunes to this in two weeks during filming (true). The ending was a dose of reality, how people make choices based on adherence to a sense of some kind of honor.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|I liked it. It did take me a bit longer to read then the others (it did drag at points) but overall a good book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I just love this book!! Is  one of my favorites books ..... it makes you think feel and do all wanted to do
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He said the movie is of good quality. He apparently had seen the movie on a bootleg version. Said this is 100% better.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Enjoy there music not much more to say. Either you like country or you don't, I do and this album was great.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This is one of the iconic movies for youth growing up in the 80s along with Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, St. Elmo's Fire, 16 Candles... Ferris does what most teenagers dream of doing... Taking a day off from school and doing something big that one will always remember is a great theme.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I enjoyed watching the orginal Star Trek but I did enjoy this series, The Enterprise also. The cast is great and I really enjoyed them in this series.
0446547573|5.0|I am an avid reader of Nicholas Sparks & this one did even more.  He never lets me down but the added twist was super. Cannot wait to see the movie
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This one for me was one of the best! I really enjoyed all the different screens you had to go into and than find and use the items to get more items for the different screens to find everything and able to have hints was good. And you knew when you found everything you needed and knew when the game was done
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Ab bey, We have not missed a single episode and hope that there are more episodes to come next year.
1451626657|5.0|I've read this book three times over the years, and I sometimes remember bits of it at odd moments. It is very funny and profound. I once read that many years later, Joseph Heller was asked why he had never written anything as good again. He replied \\"Who has?\\" He had a point.
B000UBONPW|5.0|this album has the feel of a live album, but a coziness of stevie ray and albert sitting in your living room talking music to you.<br />it is among my favorite pieces of music with excellent selections from both artists.  it is a must have for any blues fan.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome you should get it<br />I got is what I was 6 and I'm 16 I'm still liven it it's awesome
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|this is maybe the greatest story ever told.  the movie is long, but the time is required to describe the setting.  it is a pre-oil<br />economy in desert arabia, run mostly by local sheiks who disagree about everything.  it is peter o'toole's greatest<br />performance on the silver screen and the supporting actors are superb also.  if i were allowed two movies to take with me<br />to a long period of isolation, this would be one of them.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Reason i ordered this was because when i was a kid i remember watching it with my dad. This great movie that arrived well before the estimated delivery date met my expectations and brought all those great memories back. Thank you very much!!
B00A2H9NZY|4.0|The movie is good.  It gets at the realities of surfing and rarely condescends into the insulting territory in which Hollywood and the Media have mischaracterized this sport and surfers for decades.  The movie brings home the facts that the sport is a competition between surfer and nature and it is dangerous, among other things.  The sport is not about Frankie Avalon and Annette beach parties, silly surfing contests, and everybody calling everybody else a dude--as Hollywood and the Media mischaracterize it.<br /><br />Amazon's editorial review says that Mavericks is near Big Sur.  That is wrong.  Mavericks is near Half Moon Bay on the coast just below San Francisco.  Big Sur is about 100 miles from there.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's not the best, if you like \\"Temple  Run\\" you will love this. Over all, if your debating on getting this you should. It's fun and addictive. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars was because I just don't love the graphics. Other people might think differently, but that's just my opinion.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|To some folks this will really appeal to the deepest of their emotions as they can relate to it...Director has done lot of homework in casting the actors mainly to fit the amazing chemistry between Rachel and Ryan and I came to know they started dating after this movie but sadly they breakup after couple of years. Its worth watching in your lifetime. Don't miss.
0812982622|1.0|As a good read, The Orphan Master's Son scores as a 4-5 star story, but one flaw, the peaches, drops it to one star fantasy.  Born in 1930 I have years and years of home canning experience behind me, including a funeral to a family after their feast of canned peas.  FYI: I know peaches cannot produce botulin.  To develop the botulin toxin the food must be preserved in a non-acetic, anaerobic situation.  i.e no acid and no air.  Canned peaches, apricots, pears, cherries, tomatoes and other acetic foods cannot support the toxin.  Botulinus loves an acetic PH, like meat, fish, string beans, snap beans, kidney beans, navy beans, beans of all kinds, spinach, peas, carrots etc.  However if you pickle these the vinegar will stop the development of the Botulin Toxin.  So minced meat pie is safe.  When peaches rot the worst that can happen is they might start to ferment and like a hand grenade, blow the door off the refrigerator.  In conclusion:  SPARE YOURSELF THE EMBARRASSMENT.  RE-WRITE.  IF THE STORY BECOMES A MOVIE, PLLLEEEASE, NO BOTULIN IN PEACHES.  OVER AND OUT.
B009MO5G90|3.0|okay. No big surprises for an ongoing saga. but not exactly thrilled with how they are dealing with the movie.
B003THJA1G|5.0|Excellent show - very funny and enjoyable to watch. I wish I had discovered it sooner! Nathan Fillion is brilliant!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Ive been a confirmed logitech user since I first got in computers but logitech has a irritating habit of lasting less than a year and then the lengthy process of getting it replaced. The logitech site rarely if ever updates drivers so sometimes the functions of an older mouse cant be used.<br />I heard about this mouse from a friend online and started reading up on it. I was amazed by the reviews but kept thinking for such a low price it cant be that good. Im used to paying in the range of $70 to $130 for gaming mice.<br />I decided that with amazons reviews and return policy I should try it.<br />The first thing I noticed is that the mouse and software are intuitive. I had the mose up and programmed for the 2 MMO's I play in less than<br />15 mins, and i had spent hours previously trying to figure out other companies \\"simple\\" instructions.<br />The mouse is a bit light so I added the wights and found the right fit for me.<br />The buttons are very crisp and i know when ive clicked one and they have a great response time unlike some other mice where its keep clicking till something happens.<br />I waited a month to make sure my first impressions were right and so far the only minor complaints i have is the cord , I prefer a softer braided cord. I also would have liked 1 more button right under the 3 main thumb buttons but maybe that will come in a futore edition.<br />I presently own the logitech G9 gaming mouse and the logitech MX performance mouse and this is Anker mouse is the one I use every day.
1416562605|5.0|Scathing, sobering social commentary, from an unusual first-person fictional narrative, of a 'half-baked' - mostly uneducated but still literate, Indian villager who relates the tale of his ascent from out of India's rural 'Darkness' up into the light of Delhi and Bangalore.  Adiga's clever and catchy narrative device is to frame his story in a letter that the protagonist writes to now-former Chinese Premier, Wen Jiaobao, about what it takes to make a successful entrepreneur in India - avarice, bribery, incredible ambition, hard work, determination, and sometimes theft, and even murder.  That a product of the Indian middle or upper class could speak in the language, or convey the hardships, of the rural poor of India is astounding.  In the ebook's end pages the author relates that when he returns to visit India, he often likes to hang around the rail stations and other seedier environs where the underclass, the truly working poor, work, live, eat and die.  Sure, this little tome won the Man-Booker Prize - it reminds all of us who have had a reasonably good education, a mostly non-dysfunctional family upbringing, a roof over our heads, healthy food in our bellies and the opportunities to work in dignified professional settings, of our very fortunate we are.  And it makes you much more aware that there are many hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings who struggle in the Darkness in every one of our nations, trying to rise out of poverty and social injustice.  A new classic work of fiction, for sure.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Is there another book after this. A bit bizarre,but I really enjoyed it.Would recommend to anyone who likes out of the ordinary.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 is as good as the rest of the series. As I said about Season 1, it has a beautiful set, great characters, and a good plot
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it and can't stop playing it either.  I tried it on my smartphone and deleted it because it was not as good as it is on my Kindle HD.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|You better love singing in movies because half of this is all singing.  It wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers had not cast this godawful actress as the lead to sing.  I had no idea who it was and I've never heard of her.  I had to look her up when the movie was finished to find out why someone in their right mind would have given this person a lead singing role.  Her name is Julianne Hough, whom I have never heard of ever before this and now I know why.  When she opened her mouth it was like breathy helium.  Her voice was teeny bopper high it reduced this movie to the level of High School Musical or Glee.  There are no other young actresses out there who can actually sing?  Luckily, what pushes this to getting an average of three stars is everybody else in the movie who walks on screen and steals it right back out of that lousy actress/singers hands with the super high voice.  These are gifted actors who are not singers, but are able to pull it off.  Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta Jones and Mary J. Blige.  Eli Roth and Deborah Gibson make a worthwhile cameo.  The real treat is a duet and sexy outlandish performance between Tom Cruise and Malin Akerman who plays a Rolling Stone editor. Her voice was incredible and I was wondering, \\"Why is she not the lead actress instead of this other chick?\\"  Anyway, if you can past the horrible singing of this Julianne Hough character you might be able to get through this insane story set in the 80's rock era.  I'm not a fan of singing movies to begin with, but the other actors other than the lead were decent enough I could watch this...once.

B009SQR28A|5.0|Christmas with a twist. This was an enjoyable movie and the kids and adults really liked watching it. This is something we will definitely watch more.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Long read but worth it.  Explained the complex political world pre 1st World War.  Looking forward to the next book.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|The kids and the adults loved this movie. Not only did we see it in the movie theater a couple times but as soon as it came out we picked it up and the kids constantly request watching it. They have pretty much every line memorized.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|All I can say is it's all fabulous. I'm addicted to it. I recommend it to everyone, there's a little of something for everybody.
0395389496|5.0|My boys love, love, love this book. I bought them both a copy to have signed by Santa during our Polar Express ride - it was much cheaper than buying it at the train station gift shop. There is a place where Santa can sign for years to come.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am a huge lover of the paranormal romances.....this book is the first time I've Strayed from my comfort zone and it was well worth it.  I loved Pigeon and Travis.  Its a great read and well worth your time and money. I am really looking forward to Walking Disaster.
0446554995|5.0|Well written story with one of favorite characters in fiction, agent Pendergast,  although you have to have a good imagination and put aside some believeability.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Very entertaining story. The story of a spoiled girl who grows up to become a good woman thanks  to the love of a strong man.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Its a great game, but don't expect to multitask. Switching out of the app even for just a moment results in the game force closing upon trying to play again.<br /><br />Other than that one flaw, I think its a very fun and interesting game that I could play for hours.<br /><br />If that bug were to be fixed, it would be a 5/5
B00AW28HF6|5.0|Tsunami Connection is the first novel of trilogy by Michael James Gallagher and it is worth the cost- well, I got it for free but it is still a great book and I can't wait to read the other two books.<br /><br />It is a fast paced thriller about terrorists, set in the Middle East, Russia and North Korea. It shows that the author did extensive research because he gave knowledgeable details and made it quite easy for the reader to picture it, even the characters.<br /><br />What I liked most about it, is that it wasn't predictable and the story was something that actually happens in the contemporary world.
B000I9VZ8O|5.0|This a good move have liked it for years. The actors in this movie done a great job. Well worth watching!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was hard to keep track of the characters and who was related to who.  I guess I expected it to be as good as the Harry Potter series, but the writing is entirely different.  There was a predictable ending...depressing but some lessons were learned.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This a good move have liked it for years. The actors in this movie done a great job. Well worth watching!!
1932100660|4.0|This is not a review by a &#34;Health Nut&#34;. The concept of prevention by diet vs repair of disease by medicine is presented well.  Reasonable studies and explainations are provided and although a little self serving on occcastion, the author is authoritive and well versed.  I support  medicine for those in need, but also realize chemistry and radiation are not the best answers if they can be avoided. This text empowers indiviguals to take steps to prevent the need for pills and treatments.<br /><br />Sharing this book with other medical professionals has opened several thoughtful discussions. The approach of feeding people better, vs  treating each indivigual after they have been reduced by disease, makes good sense.  Does this book present the total answer, not at all, but it paints in some important corners.
B00005JO20|5.0|This a good move have liked it for years. The actors in this movie done a great job. Well worth watching!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I gave this book 3 stars because, although it was a good story and a little different than most thrillers, it was a little too repetative and had too many short sentances. It also repeated phrases too often. It was slow starting but it did get interesting as you moved into the book. I liked the ending as it was a little different than most hero, heroin stories.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|This by far is one of the most phenomenal shows I have ever watched. I absolutely love it! It has plenty of action,suspense, drama, and is really quite humorous, what more could you ask for?!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Having the trilogy was exciting for the price of $15.00 was amazing, I was so excited to watch them with my husband I even let him open it early, even though my husband is a huge fan of anything batman  and is not a big fan of Christian Bale we still love these movies and will be an excellent addition to our growing collection of all his favorite superheroes we are building for our son!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I laughed and cried. What a great cast f actors. Josh Brolin has Tommy Lee character down to a science to a point that you think you are watching the younger version
B0063IH60K|3.0|i only rated this down because of the types of advertisements.  most of them are just fine but there are some dating type ones that are not appropriate for kids and my son and daughter like to play.  otherwise i love this app and have nothing bad to say about the actual game or how it works.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|My seven-year-old daughter says she likes this movie a lot. I also thought it was cute. I would have given it a 4.5 star rating if it were available. I only didn't give it five stars because she didn't quite say that she loved it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|like to play. wish coins came faster. wish puzzle pieces would drop more frequently. my four year old gets a kick out of playing too.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|So enjoying these books!  The 20th C has to be the most interesting in history, and Ken Follett has done it justice!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I really enjoyed Sweet Tooth, and cannot say enough about McEwan's literary style.  Sweet Tooth is just another example of his unique creativity, and ability to create characters that are authentic and captivating. Sweet Tooth reads like a memoir, told from the point of view of a female in British Intelligence during the Cold War. Serena, the main character, is very easy to relate to and McEwan cleverly maps out her many experiences leading up to her involvement with the Sweet Tooth operation.  McEwan does an incredible job of establishing  the historical context of the novel, much of which applies to present-day conflict.<br /><br />I almost did not read Sweet Tooth, due to the many reviewers that found this novel to be too slow. While clearly it is not a fast-paced espionage thriller, it is a very well crafted novel that deals with issues of love, betrayal, adulthood, and the Cold war. It truly reads like a memoir, which perhaps is why it seemed \\"slow\\" to some. I, on the other hand, loved the writing and the complexity of the relationship between Serena and Tom, and was always excited to sit down and read it. The ending was well done, and nicely tied up the various story-lines.<br />I really enjoyed Atonement, also by McEwan, and wondered if the bar had been set so high that I would not enjoy this book. The opposite was true, I liked it as well as Atonement, and perhaps even better since I have always had an interest in intelligence. McEwan's writing style is unique, and his ability to write from the female perspective speaks to his artistic gift. Throughout the novel, there are short stories shared with the reader,  which could potentially be seen as interrupting the story, yet McEwan's ability to tie in the stories that Serena reads into the novel, creates a bond between Serena and the reader, as though both are reading the same story together. These little stories to some, may seem irrelevant, but throughout the novel the reader recognizes their importance. And, I believe, these different short stories highlight McEwan's differing styles and creativity.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a story of espionage that, like I said earlier, reads like a memoir. Filled with emotion, history, and a thorough and well-executed plotline.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Always a great &#34;look-back&#34; at high school life. Truly not much different than current day to be honest. ;) One of my all-time favorites!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I've never read a better book, it's better than anything Thomas head wrote. It's a great mix of all things fantasy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome.  i had this game for 12 years. my brother plays it and my sister plays it.
B001F12J48|1.0|The 3-D movie wasn't the new 3-D HD technology. You had to wear these funky red/blue glasses, not the glasses that came with our 3-D tv. You could not watch it during the day and the quality was poor. We can't even watch it. A total waste.
B008EKON56|4.0|Works with my &#34;Earphone jack failing&#34; Ipod touch. No Volume control, but the music is loud enough when using the Line out jack with my headphones. Works good, sounds great.
B006H5120E|5.0|We loved it. Everything we expected. We also enjoyed the documentary that came with it. Seeing it in 3-D was very enjoyable.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I ordered this cd after reading a review somewhere else and it was literally just a few days before Chriistmas, but I knew my husband would love this disc.  I put a hand-made gift cert under the tree to stand in for the disc, but lo and behold, the disc arrived just before Christmas Day!  Incredible speed in shipping by this seller and the dis is in perfect condition.
B00BB8UTEC|1.0|What can I say - it was the worst movie I have seen in a LONG time and I watch quite a few movies!  While I love a happy ending, which this had (I think), the getting there was painfully awful. Tons of people making poor choices - yeh, that's life, but somehow they tried to glorify immorality in this movie - like that is the norm - maybe in Hollywood - UGH!!!  Why aren't there more good movies like The Blind Side - just a good clean story with a good lesson for life!!?????  A lot of great actors - what were they thinking??!!  Too bad you can't get a refund if you hate the movie - bummer we rented it on Valentine's Day - everything about our evening was perfect except our movie choice!!
B002JVWQSW|4.0|A gift and the receipient loves it. Good DVD.  Would purchase again from Amazon.  May consider the other seasons. That is all.
B0096BIENY|4.0|Just another way to hear some old songs, in a group of great voices, you can put it on a traffic jam to relax.
0345803485|3.0|I enjoy the book for the most part, but it still has a lot of the goofy romance plot. It is far more erotic than most romances.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even my husband loves this show, especially Maggie Smith.  I am looking forward to seeing season 3 on Amazon Prime.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it fells like its a real horse.  like I'm actually touching it. hard work but all worth it. love it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I really like this game. I think if you guys had more thinks if will be very fun. you can add black op and minecrafet togethere it will be very fun
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|great game lots of hog game. hard seek and find. good story line easy. a little on the short side but a good game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Just get it. Awesome. Better than anyother ripoffs like survival craft. Would give it 10 stars if i could. WHAT IM TRYING TO SAY: GET IT!!!!!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|I bought this thinking it would get my wife turned on but instead she got a headache. Who do I need to see about this? Joking, she loved the books, read them about 3 times.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|Kinda fun if you are bored. Stuck  on level 8 tho. Decent price but should be 99 cents for the game. Graphics are ok.
0802473156|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very helpful. I recommend this book to anyone who want to learn how to love people better. I also enjoyed &#34;The 5 Love Languages&#34; for Children.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good but one problem. Problem is that i swipe to the side and i jump.Other wise great .graphics ok sound ok
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Motiva a que uno consiga sus propios sueños! Es un libro que no me cansaré de leer por qué sus historias y leyendas inspiran mucho a luchar y disfrutar de todo lo bueno de la vida!!! Siempre recordaré \\"cuando todos los días parecen iguales es por que las personas han dejado de percibir las cosas buenas de la vida\\"
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where do I start here?<br /><br />After hearing so much about this book (I had several coworkers who were obsessed with it), I decided to buy it and give it a try. I wish I could get my money back plus the time I wasted reading it (doing some form of housework would have been preferable).<br /><br />For anyone who has ever read online fiction, this story reeks of the Mary Sue mentality. Where the writer inserts themselves in to a plot line and everything goes magically for her, the impossible is possible, and everything is purely unbelievable. I enjoy fiction as much as the next person, but this was just gratuitously Mary Sue. There was no true conflict, there was nothing exciting, I just found it lacking in so many aspects.<br /><br />I find it hilarious that this book made such a splash with its &#34;erotic&#34; scenes. I have been a reader of romance novels for years and I have come books that had much more realistic erotic scenes,  better story lines, and just better everything.<br /><br />Further, was there a copy editor? Or did they just give up? The main character is constantly repeating the same motions, over and over. I'm surprising she didn't have a perpetual bloody hole in her lip with as much as she chewed on it.<br /><br />Most well-written fiction books have some hint of realism or at least the plot is written in such a way that you can see it happening, can place yourself in the role of the main character, and understand how/why the plot progresses as it does. This has none of that, it reads like a 14 year old virgin watched a fairy princess movie and then mixed it with a bad porno she stole from her parents.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game for horse lover's you should definetley get this app my daughter loves it, and it doesn't demand money like most other free apps.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The best TV show ever. Great acting, Great story, Great effects and Great Intensity. Move over True Blood this show is number 1 now.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Needs an option to turn off dialog completely instead of having to do it through the menu each time. I also wish it wasn't so \\"new age\\"
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I loved it! It was funny!! It's great for really anyone who likes something funny!!!!!! You should really get it
B007IQWQ88|5.0|The Psalms tell us to \\"make a joyful sound unto the Lord\\".  You will not find a more joyful sound anywhere than that found in this collection.  What a marvellous set!  I owned twenty-four of these CDs as LPs when I was a teen, and absolutely loved them, so to have ALL of them in one set... Oh my!  Von Karajan has been my favorite conductor for nearly fifty years, and his interpretation of Beethoven is nothing but breathtaking.  But there is so much else here as well.  This is the perfect introduction to classical music.  Don't miss it!
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|it's a light hearted flying experience...for enjoyment on the tablet. I think it's graphics are great, and would suggest it to anyone interested in Helis.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game looks great and is a horse lovers paradise. It looks great and the horse is adorable! Its not one of those games you have to pay for to get ahead either. The free app is exactly that,free.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I am a Stephen King fan but this is not one of his best books. His endings are always kinda disappointing and this one is no exception. It seems he's getting less creative in his old age, recycling ideas from years ago.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This works great. I like the tap feature instead of holding and dragging the cards. The graphics are very good.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Laid up in bed for the a month and doing a lot of reading, so far this book is my favorite! It is a really great adventure story. Weir keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. A bit technical in places but he handles it well.
0307346617|5.0|I cried so many times reading this book its embarrassing. Every chapter is a breath of fresh air. My wife is rolling her eyes at me right now because she doesn't believe a book about zombies could have any sort of real depth or story, but even shes curious to read it now. Its not really a novel, but more like chicken soup for the undead soul..
B001LM1456|5.0|I have always been a Hulk fan and this movie did not disappoint.  I have seen it half a dozen times and still love watching it.  Hope they well make a squeal in the next Avenger set.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Action from beginning to end. Just when you think it's over, the whole romance wins again. To bad this isn't the way real life is. Wonderfully well written.
1476712042|4.0|I really enjoyed this book... the editing was very poor but the book itself made up for it.  I found myself not able to put the book down and am looking forward to Walking Disaster this April!
B00782O7IY|5.0|Spectacular movie...recreates the era of silent films and goes beyond! Acting superb and this film definitely deserved the Oscar! Will enjoy it for years to come!!!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app was just what I needed. The fact that it was free was even better. The larger size buttons and display made use much easier on my kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|catching Fire was awesome!!!!!!! it had a lot of suspense and that is what i like. the best part was at the end when gale showed up and was like there is no district twelve  itvwasb awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B3T6FIS|5.0|good family movie.<br />One part where John Candy makes fun of the Lord's Prayer, but overall a great family flick.
0425252868|5.0|I am not a fan of war stories, but I enjoyed the human interest side of this story dealing with the most important decisions we are ever forced to make.
B00340ESIS|5.0|So far the best book on three act story structure I've read. The advice works as well for books as it does for scripts.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|You will have to go back at the same thing with a good boy and his team of researchers have discovered rental car and a buck stops the world-wide ugh ST century and the world-wide the same time for the world-wide and his
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|I love Robert Pattinson. I'm absolutely convinced that he is going to have a long and distinguished career. I loved all the Twilight movies, and I adored him in Remember Me. And then he started to choose projects that would stretch him and confound his fans. Bel Ami was stiff, but Cosmopolis is a study in stiff. It's not a movie so much as a long nightmare in which every word is measured and every character represents something heavy. Seriously, movie lovers, why deliberately expose yourselves to this free-flowing abuse of screen time? Even Pattinson, who is very handsome in his business suit, isn't enough to make me want to watch this again. I'm not sorry I bought it; I'm just sorry I watched it.
0205313426|5.0|As someone who writes a lot, I've also read a lot on grammar and style. Recent publications impressed upon me that things like split infinitives are not so bad, that the &#34;rules&#34; of writing were made to be broken in our modern age. Really? Have you read an email or text message lately? The more of them I read the more incomprehensible garbage I find. Like many of you, I was introduced to Strunk and White in college. I've never been without a copy since. I wear out one copy and replace it with another. As for you grammarians who believe that split infinitives don't violate the rules of good grammar, keep it to yourselves....
0425221806|5.0|Dean Koontz is my all time favorite author, I have every book he ever wrote. Almost all in hardback.  my daughter got me a kindel so i could have them stored. I have read watchers so many times I wore the book out and needed a new one to replace it. I also reread all his books about once a year.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I bought this after using the trial version on my kindle fire.  I really like this product because it does have a huge choice of sounds and melodies to choose from and you can combine any sounds: for instance, rain falling with piano music and frogs chirping.  I also like the fact that there is a timer on it and unlike what someone else wrote in a review, this continues to play while I'm also reading a book on my kindle. Very nice.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|this app has been amazing but after I got to level 66 the entire game reset and keeps making me Redo everything. I thought maybe it my kindle but after resetting that it still makes me re start the game. I would give it a 5 star but after it did this I lost interest
B009UX2YAC|2.0|we were having so much fun with this game. it is so fun to collect the characters and finish missions so you can get more boxes.  THEN BAM!  its all deleted somehow.  all your hard work down the drain.  tried again to build up...again everything gone.  its not worth all your hard work.  DONT SPEND MONEY ON COINS YOU NEVER KNOW IF THEY WILL BE THERE TOMORROW
B002T9H2LA|2.0|I was never warned that this item was even shipped. Under &#34;Your Orders&#34;, it still says &#34;Shipping Soon&#34;. I never received an email stating that it was shipped either. Yet, I just received the item today in the mail. Something not right there.... Not only that, the disc has a nice scratch or scuff mark on it along with a few other small scratches. The movie froze up on me in the first scene about 2:25 into the film.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|last year.  My husband loves the use of the English Language in this show.  He is amazed at the organization of the household and the way life was lived there and then.  It's kinda funny because he doesn't normally watch this kind of stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great addictive fun! Plus it is very challenging as well! Colorful graphics and easy to maneuver the character. You don't need to buy any coins.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|It is a good ap for recording your thoughts and ideas.  I use it to take notes at meetings and save messages I want to keep.  It is easy to use.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love this show. What can I say more than I love this show. I still have 3 more words. Done. : )
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like that it is easy to use with the larger buttons but I really like that it has a virtual tape in it.  It shows your past work so you can check back on older answers.  I really like being able to do that.  Good job designers!
B0094K1JPC|4.0|I really liked this movie. It made me laugh. Love Rachel Adams and Harrison Ford. Really funny. Again....hate the word requirement on these ratings.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The app is easy to work but I am not sure all the puzzles are doable.  I have conquered most of them and was entertained doing them.  I tried a couple of them on a teenage grandson and he found them interesting also.
B006OEPITO|5.0|I found this book to be very inspirational.  If you have an interest the philosophies of the East.  This is a must read.  EZ
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We watched season 1 on the internet and used a lot of band width that we don't have to spare so I ordered the dvd and we did season 2 with it.  My husband loves the use of the English language and the wit of the characters.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book. It's really inspirational. And really relatable. I couldn't even put it down. Read it in two days! Get this now!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|do enjoy those Angry Birds.... they like Star Wars too so the combination is a good choice for them.  It is cute to see them working the puzzles out together.
B005GRF2UK|5.0|Movie arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Not a bad thing to say and it's hard to as this is my favorite movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|As in many of his books Sparks has a way of pulling you into his novels and making you feel the emotions of his characters.  This book is no different; from vulnerability, to love, to anger and fear Sparks hits every emotional cord in a book that will leave you eager to find out what happens next. Another great read from this author!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app I feel like a real horse owner. Also it shows you what its like to take care of a real horse
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It reminded one of what true love is really about. That one can only dream about it. Showed that one shouldn't give up.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Have been looking for these to replace an older set. The sound is great, they are lightweight and don't fall off like ear buds do  when moving around a lot doing yard work.
B006M4F67A|5.0|The game is easy to see and there are quite a few layouts.  I enjoy this mahjong app because it is very responsive to the touch and is not jerky or sluggish.  All the buttons and controls are very nice and give a feeling of being well designed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|That twist at the end... nice. I admit I was speed reading past the blah gushy and sex stuff to find the plot. I have NO idea why I like these books.<br />Going to the third and final book. Your welcome.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like this puzzle app the best of several that I have tried.  And I like it even more so now because it offers ,a free puzzle daily
B009EEFTMC|1.0|No new idea. Barely a puzzle. Ugly colors, nauseating music. No thought required. The tiles aren't trapped in any way so there is no challenge at all in matching them or removing them.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|We recently saw this Cirque movie at the theatre, and I purchased two dvds for my cousins' children.  The slightly slowed motion of many scenes makes them even more jaw-dropping.  This is an experience that will inspire kids' imaginations.
1568363931|5.0|This book is perfect for bento beginners! It features colourful pictures to go with every bento, and black and white photos to help you prepare the food. Every recipie comes with a timeline to help you prepare your bentos efficently, and to help you stay on top of things. Every recipie is aimed at being healthy but yummy, so being healthy is fun! The only bad thing I have to say is that the shipping was very delayed for me, it took over a month for it to ship to Australia. Alos, the book was a little damadged around the edges.<br /><br />All in all, this book is perfect for bento beginners, and I would recommend it to everyone!
B007EE4XKI|4.0|David Mack delivered Star Trek readers the Destiny Trilogy a few years ago and it changed the Star Trek universe forever.  Now Mack returns with another story that will turn the Star Trek universe upside down.  Have you heard rumors about a return of a character?  Yeah, it's good stuff.<br /><br />This story begins with a heist of all of the Noonien Soong Androids which have been kept by Captain Bruce Maddux.  Captain Maddux was the Cybernetics who attempted to disassemble Data and study him in the Season two episode of Measure of a Man.  However, he has since had a change of heart and his beliefs and now believes that androids should have the same rights as every other life form.  An investigation is immediately done by the Enterprise and they begin to follow a ship that they believe could be the perpetrator.  However, aboard that ship is none other than Dr. Noonien Soong himself.  You might be thinking that Dr. Soong has been dead since the 4th season episode Brothers.  Don't worry that as well as a lot more is explained in the novel.<br /><br />I have been out of the Star Trek universe for quiet a while now, however hearing  that a certain character who might be returning has pulled me back in.  This novel is well written and I don't have to tell anyone that has read a Star Trek novel by David Mack, he knows the characters extremely well.  If I had one criticism to say about the book is that it can be a little long winded at times.  I find myself skipping a paragraph every once and awhile just to get back into the action.  However, while the quality of this adventure is not nearly as good as the Destiny Trilogy this book is really solid and a must for any Star Trek fan, especially a fan of the machine that was known as Data.<br /><br />Grade B+

1591843162|5.0|I received this book as a gift from a mentor. It was the perfect manner for him to express that he believes in me, my work, and my professional goals!<br /><br />Linchpin is an inspiring read for anyone who has struggled to find a balance between \\"fitting in\\" and using the gifts (unique skills) you have cultivated. If you are one of the lucky ones to have already identified what your gifts are, this will serve as encouragement to embrace your gifts, use them every day, and share them freely with others. If you have not yet discovered what makes your work unique and special, you will feel as if Godin has challenged you to search within and discover your gifts - and to stop worrying about whether or not you fit in.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is one awe inspiring book.  It is very humbling to read about the bravery of so many, alive or now dead, their actions given so selflessly.  This story demands retelling time and again, above all to young people. There are so many valuable lessons told in these pages, enough to form the basis for a lifetime of valuable contribution to decent behavior traits for our youthful citizens to emulate. This story was gripping throughout, every page begging for a turn. Well done!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very fun and slightly addicting. However, it is a great challenge to the mind! I definetely reccomend buying this app.
0788844989|3.0|aged; needs recast updated; I liked the story a great deal; good insights into her art, marriage & escapades. Her husband an usual and great artist who eventually discovered love of Frida.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|A very good page turner and humorous in sections. Good enjoyable read but a little repetitious in sections. Looking forward to third episode.<br />Nicholas
B00846REIS|2.0|Reads like 50 shades of gray.  About the same characters with. A few exceptions. I was looking for a good follow up from 50 and this just seems like a college copy.
0780020685|5.0|Its absolutely true, this is the best Samurai movie ever! Its a true classic!  A perfect and necessary addition to anyone's Kurosawa collection.
B009LDMJBU|3.0|Eros Ramazzotti's albums are generally of exceptionally high quality. However, I found this one to be much more difficult to listen to than any of his previous albums. It has a rockier, more cutting-edge sound but it lacks the well-crafted melodies and the subtle production, that have been typical of his previous work, particularly when in collaboration with song-writer/producer Claudio Guidetti.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Another great Kurosawa epic! a Must for Kurosawa enthusiasts.  A perfect addition to his legacy of classic films.  Buy it and enjoy.
B0009PAVI2|1.0|This pouch has a hard surface inside and out. It tends to leave marks on my filters that can only be removed with a wet cleaning cloth. Cannot recommend. BAD
B000059XUI|5.0|How can you go wrong with this series of movies...if you love super powered hero stories...if you have imagination...if you want to watch good crush evil here it is. Christopher Reeves is the best as Superman.

B004T32SOK|5.0|Between Dropbox, Sugarsync, and Box - Box is the best. I got 50GB of free storage instead of just 5GB because of a free promotion. That's 10x more than Sugarsync and 25x more Dropbox. Box has way more features and is the most secure. Love it!
B009H1S56O|5.0|I was afraid it wouldn't include the 3 deluxe songs (Without You, Lolita, Lucky Ones) because some people are saying these songs are missing on their boxes, but it's all included. It's all perfect.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|All I can say is that this book is well worth reading.  A very fresh voice and story.  Sweet and funny and very real.  Ordinary people in  extraordinary circumstances.

141659521X|5.0|I love Vince Flynn's novels.  My husband and I share the same interest in this type of novel.  They are exciting reads and makes one realize that our government is corrupt.  Yes I know it is a novel, but he has excellent contacts in our government.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|5FDP gives you all you want in a CD. Hard core head banging, or the softer song for a enjoyable drive. Not everyone will like them, but if you love HARD hitting rock.. give them a try.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Fantastic app. Tells you plainly what you need to know. Like the plain graphics ..just high Tec enough for people like me. Highly recommended!

B0050N8N0Q|5.0|A must have! The entire album is awesome. Great purchase price too! ITunes cannot even begin to compete with Amazon. I proabably would have paid twice the amount on ITunes.
B003QTBT5C|5.0|A new favorite. A wonderful CD, amazing music- one of the rare CDs where I don't skip any selection. This CD is saving my live when I'm stuck in traffic.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Very much enjoyed this movie, but I can see why it didn't exactly sell out the theaters!  A deeply accurate, reflective view of a lengthy marriage in which the love remains but the demonstration of it has long since passed.  Gives us hope that we can all change, and that all that seems to be lost may still be saved.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I find it sort of challanging, fast paced and fun to play.  I usually play a few sets prior to retiring for the night as it is very relaxing and helps me to unwind.

B008K8VDPU|3.0|This app is okay, I don't use it much. It will come in handy when I'm waiting somewhere bored and need something to &#34;play&#34;. When you're a real piano player like myself, it doesn't really compare (finger touch, etc.) but for play, it's okay.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|The game is colorful and controls are very smooth. In both Puzzle mode and Attack mode, cubes are removed by matching them, which is the only similarity to Mahjong. All cubes are free. In Puzzle mode, the shorter the time to remove all cubes the better the score. Attack mode starts out with four small cubes. Cubes are added until the \\"master cube\\" is complete. The longer it takes for it to be complete, the better the score. The only variation in these two modes is that the cube pattern is random. I prefer a game with more variety.  However, if you enjoy the challenge of beating your own time or others' time, you might like this game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Book 2 was a little more difficult to get in to, but once in you get to the second and third sections you can't put it down. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone I know!!!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|After I moved across the state, there were a few radio stations that I missed. This app allows me to not only explore other state/country radio stations, but listen to the radio stations that I grew up listening to. Only problem, is that not all radio stations are not streamable, and sometimes, depending on the location, take longer than normal to stream, and at a lower bandwidth rate. But, it gets the job done. The pro version allows you to record the radio as well.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very good book,kept my interest, liked the two person narrative. Would like to read more from this author.First time I rated a book five stars.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Lots of fun. I like it.  As others have said, it's like mahjong but better.<br /><br />For future development - different tileset options (maybe more subdued colors, mahjong designs) and more relaxing, contemplative music and sounds.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The mine cart sections are annoying but add a degree of difficulty. I would suggest adding customization options like increased speeds, specific powers only, no powers etc. for added difficulty and fun.
1579126510|4.0|A very nice set for a reasonable price.  I guess we can take a pass on the author - the question is how well this is organized and bound.  Great for the price, I say.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Not at all what I expected..... I thought it would be funnier.... Watch the Trailer and do not rent the movie, you can see all the funny parts from there... Walberg is better than that!!
1449410243|2.0|I had really looked forward to this book, I thought it would be a fun read filled with tongue in cheek jokes through cartoons and text explaining through the interpretation of feline behaviour that what we thought was something innocent, was actually them plotting our demise.  There are four pages that cover the title's topic, and that's it.  A few other pages of your cat doing other non human admiring things but that's all.  The rest is mostly some poor quality primary school age toilet humour kid aimed comic strip about two cats working in an office who bully human workers, don't respect their boss, photocopy their but on the photocopier and a heap of other antisocial behaviour.  There's a few other decent pages once this the Bobs nonsense finishes, such as a human behaving like a cat, and a cat through a number of different pages trying to get the attention of its owner who is glued to his computer screen, but there's also some pretty average stuff on the last couple of pages as well.<br /><br />A great idea for a title, they just didn't have the ability to turn the title into a book I guess.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I need closed captions and it wasn't here. This was on amazon prime rental. If I had known there wasn't CC, I wouldn't have paid for it.
B000127LW2|3.0|The first season of voyager was all well done, episodically. The disappointment lies in the fact that there were only 15 episodes, which shows a lack of faith in the product. It was as if the powers that be behind Star Trek made a decision to throw this out there, and see what the reaction was.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The end was so unexpected and completely AWESOME! I recommend everyone read these books! It's a great series and this is a great book!
B000JJSPXQ|5.0|A nice remembrance of just how good Roxette was as a band during the late 80s and 90s. Nice work, good music, excellent singing.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We only have a few movies in 3D. This was the best and picture is very clear and when it jumps out at you its just GREAT!
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Very happy with Season 5 of Gilmore Girls! It arrived on time and was exactly as described. Good value too!!<br /><br />This is probably my favorite season of GG.. mostly because of Logan =)
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read this book twice - I cannot get the characters out of my head. And I can't wait for the third installment.<br /><br />I think it's as good or better than Fifty Shades - the love scenes are not as graphic. But definitely read Bared to You first to set the stage.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|cheap not worth the time to return.. but I thought because it was Stanley that it would be good quality
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a great follow up to Fifty Shades, and I think it is better written. The plots are very similar, but this is more &#34;tame.&#34;<br /><br />I immediately ordered and read Reflected in You after reading Bared to You. Can't wait for the third book to be published.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Of course, what would you expect from Adele. The historical side of the Royal Albert Hall makes this DVD even more treasured. So many amazing performers through out the years. Adele does not disappoint. She seems charming and very comfortable surrounded by her fans and her friends. The remarks between songs are a hoot! .
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The beginning of the story was slow, but the complex intertwining of characters grew as the story progressed. By the end of the story, I really enjoyed what I had read.<br /><br />This is an easy-to-read book and is recommended for anyone who wants a change from Fifty Shades and the Crossfire series to something a little more tame but with a complex story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks, you kept me wanting to read and read.  The ending was so heart felt.  I didn't expect the ending it had.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A nice alternative to romance novels. While you can almost see the end of the story from early in the book, you can't possibly guess all the twists and turns.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter to play while I was cooking. she loves it and so do i! its a great wholesome game that shows animal care.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was captivated from the very beginning of this book. The details are great (I hope the movie does this book justice). It's a story of triumph over a tragic marriage. It should give people hope that they can overcome a difficult situation.
B00000IZOR|5.0|Had this toy growing up as a kid , wanted to purchase it for my baby she loves it... ....
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I expected something different, more comedy.  I wanted my husband to see the movie with me.  As I watched the movie, I was afraid he might take the movie personally like he wasn't doing enough to please me, which wasn't true.  The movie came across to me  like a psychotherapy movie rather than an entertainment movie.  I was disappointed.
0062082353|5.0|This is a great look into what our special forces go through and what actually happened on the ground in Iraq and Afganistan.
B001AQR3IU|4.0|I owned the DVD and just had to upgrade to Bluray and it was definitely worth it! An unlifting romance along with suspenseful adventure I cannot stop watching over and over!
B002QUWYWE|5.0|A great thriller.  Very Mild language and plenty of suspense.  Kathy Bates is terrific!  .  I am not a big horror movie or &#34;Hannibal&#34; love-to get- scared-out -of- my-mind kind of a person.  Her character has plenty of the creep factor but still enough of a fictional element to make this film more fun than terrifying.  You will still be able to sleep at night, but hearing the words, &#34;I'm your biggest fan&#34; may make you want to keep one eye open just to be on the safe side.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book inspires me to be a man of Honor and outlive my life. I want to be a better  father, husband, and Christian. Thank you Adam for your sacrifice and service.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new Temple Run is AWESOMELY AWESOME in every way  and FREE!!!! I know that you will LOVE IT!!!!!!<br /><br />4
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This is one of my favourite books, thrilling, exciting, nerve racking, awesome adventure novel!!!!!!!! If you like it, read the other books in the series!!!!!!!<br /><br />Angela Gupta<br />P.S if you want to know anything more, email angelaxinying@gmail.com
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Cursed onboard is a great game. Loved the clear colorful graphics. However, after purchasing the full version to continue the adventure, I find myself at a standstill. I am in the child's room in the hidden object area and can't get the last crayon because it is actually UNDER the back button!!!. So what am I suppose to do? I want my money back. I have been robbed!
B000W64Q1G|5.0|I were looking for this film in diferent parts. They just had it by order, and the price was higher.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|This book is great, either on its own, or as a supplement to the video lectures on ocw.mit.edu. Reading this book is like having a tutorial from the instructor. However,I would recommend a good wireless connection,as there are many links to illustrate key points.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. It works.  It does what I want.  It has options.  It saves my game.  I won the first game I played!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Terrific on Blu-ray. Did not like quality with download.<br /><br />Enjoyed this movie on Blu-ray DVD. Glad to add this to my collection.<br /><br />Regrettably, not appropriate for small children under 13.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I have never used this.  It only takes up space in my kindle.  No directions on how to play these games
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was beautifully animated by Artifex Mundi. Some of the puzzles were familiar from other games, but not similar enough to ruin the puzzles. Having the ingame walk through is especially nice for those of us fairly new to gaming. I'm so glad these games are made available for the Kindle Fire. Using the touch screen makes the game almost personal. I would much rather play on the Kindle than on the pc. I guess It feels more like I was \\"in\\"the game rather than just playing it....kind of like an mini-adventure vacation instead of just playing a game.Thanks to the games producer and especially thanks for my Kindle Fire(to Rodger).
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I was it in 97 but never got the dual meanings.  We won't ever know what else is out there so all we have is each other.  When Palmer says he for one believe's her.  They hands touch and we have contact the whole point of the movie.  Best Blu Ray value I have ever seen.
0395389496|5.0|I purchased this book in conjunction with the Polar Express DVD. My grandchildren loved the beautiful pictures and, of course, the story line.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This was pretty good for the HO scenes - objects generally findable, and often pretty difficult! But findable. I thought the scenes were sparse as far as the interactivity goes, and the mini-games were uninteresting. I agree w/ another reviewer about posting silly non-postings! Really? People want to post this stuff?! Over all, not as good as many other G5 games and a bit dull.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The Gruffalo is a great story.  Love the little mouse character.  Wish it was a little more than 40 minutes.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I havent finished the game yet, but i'm enjoying it very much. The hidden object games need to be a little harder,i found playing monaco instead;you get a choice of hidden objects or monaco,was a little break for the simple h.o.Overall,great story, great graphics definitely worth the price fora couple days enjoyment.Go ahead and get it.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|The Possession was not as good as I had hoped for.  The story reads better than the actual film is.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I absolutely love this album, it emulates a likeness to several musical genres; therefore, if listen to a variety of music from indie rock to electronic, to rap, this album for you.
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled is one of our favorite &#34;new&#34; Disney films.  love the strong lead female character and yet it follows a classic story line.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|A fantastic adventure that  follows the story well. The casting is fantastic.This show helps me get over my longing for<br />Deadwood.
B005LAIHCM|4.0|House at the End of the Street is a good movie for any horror fan.  Even the box art gives you the willies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun trying to beat high scores and your friends! I wish I could play it all the time .most amazing game ever
B00AA8Q0FQ|4.0|Little girls that are familiar with the TV series will enjoy this DVD also.  It is nice to have two stories on one disk.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good read . Great story. Suspenseful plot. David B. Has a knack for writing great mysteries. Enjoyable. Will continue to read his books.
B005LAII12|5.0|Very funny movie but VERY R rated.  Not sure why he got an Academy nomination, but then I don't sit on the committee.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great if you dot have you are really lame if u get this game if will change your life.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar is a great film. Can't wait for a sequel to appear.  Great animation and cinematography.  Thank you for this film.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Once I started reading this I just couldn't stop. To say that this guy puts McGyver to shame is like comparing a candle to the sun. An Astronaut stranded on Mars by mistake he has to make do with only the materials at hand and what he manages  to do is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. A book like this at that price is absolutely amazing. I just hope to find more that engage me as much as this one did.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Hotel Transylvania is a fun film for the whole family.  Our older grandson can recite lines from it he likes it so well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is action pact and exciting game of 2013. At school people rave about Temple Run 2 way more than Subway Surfers!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Pitch Perfect is a fun musical drama with some interesting characters.  We love this type of singing so enjoyed the music the most.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for when you are relaxing and having alone time! Try this app, its fun and keeps your brain working
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Curious and introspective story of adolescents dealing with adult issues. The reader has the opportunity to delve into the minds of the characters who face terminal illnesses. A good read.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game keeps my grandboys occupied for hours, and thats a good thing especially if you are busy cooking or cleaning or even getting your nails done, just get this angry birds and you will have peace while it occupies them
B005LAIGWS|1.0|Worst acting I've ever seen Cage do. And he's done some stinkers. This really not worth anyone's money on standard DVD let alone Blu-ray.
0439023491|5.0|I love this book! I have read the whole series and have loved each one. It is a great read!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Had been playing it on my I phone tried to move on to my Kindle for larger screen. I found no place to put in the account I created and was unable to continue with what I had started. very costly!  No place or button to click for help!
B005P5TQPU|5.0|i loved it. i have watched every season and i like i can watch on my computer. it was awsome
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I watched this and thought this kind of stuff could really happen in the world as it is today. Would it not be nice to have someone that could figure it all out like these folks.
B0069JBKHI|3.0|Baby is now 1 week old...I've rebooted and reinstalled this monitor almost every day since we receive the error &#34;unable to connect&#34;.<br />Even before the baby arrived, we were disappointed in just how much of a delay there is (on a extremely fast WiFi network), but figured the few seconds wouldn't be bad if the rest of the experience was ok.<br />The picture was good, I liked the temp/humidity options, as well as the ability to customize alerts...but you'll soon turn the alerts off, as the adjustable times for &#34;tolerance&#34; don't seem to affect anything and you'll soon have a page full of notifications on your ipad / iphone.  You'll also have to keep your iDevice somewhere off your person if you're checking on the little one - as the alerts have a loud chime that goes off when motion is detected.<br /><br />Finally, the internal battery must be for nothing more than keeping settings when moving it.  We put the little one in a swing and set the monitor nearby while cooking, and within 20 minutes the low battery notification went off (then triggering a reboot and cycle all over again to get it set up).<br /><br />It looks like it is just a bit early for it's time - wait for a more robust product that allows streaming to iDevices.
B009K86D86|4.0|If you like food you have got to see this, I certainly learned a lot. S o I am going to watch this again, I have started telling my friends about this in hopes they will get this at the library.
B0061S073A|5.0|We purchased a Kindle HD for our 10 year old son and the app allows us to limit what he wants to download and requires us to input a secret code in order for him to get anything from any website which is great because there is alot of inappropriate material not suitable for 10 year olds on Amazon and other websites.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Time flys with these puzzles.  It is just like a real puzzle but I do not worry about my cat playing with the loose pieces.  Highly recommend.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Really like the story of this little town in England..The characters are really fun and the family dynamics are so interesting. There are a lot of characters in this story so keep a pencil handy just to remnd you of their relationship to each other.
B009FXIICK|5.0|Very addictive game!!  I play this at least once a day -- it's my go-to game when I need to waste a little time waiting in line or wherever.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|Page turner. I learned a lot. Highly recommend. Yergins research is unreal. I loved this book! Anyone interested in energy should read.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like these kind of games and this is one of the top ones ... sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard.  Shapes are similar enough to be confused with others especially when you're trying to move fast to get a good time.  Looks awesome and plays well on my Kindle Fire HD.
1468179993|1.0|total lightweight brochure - it is not even a book. I returned it, it does not even give any background of author - it could be you or me writing this.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great app!  It really is cute.  We haven't seen anything this nice for awhile.  And whoever made this is a very smart and creative person.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Can watch this again and again. Liam Neeson's acting ability never ceases to amaze me. now i cant wait to see the new musical version!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun for kids and adluts I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!I recoumend this game if u want a challenge or just like puzzels.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My son loves this game, he plays it about four time a week.  Grafics are awesome.  Would recommend if your child loves Spider-man.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Quick read can't put book down. You want to know what is in Grey's past to make him so guarded
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing how resultant the human race is once our survival is threatened. Loved the series. Was going to order it as individual  books, but then saw the five books in one , of course I had to buy that version. Well written, believable characters, exciting and a fast page turner. Just ordered O<br />SHIFT. Can't wait to read how this all started. You just can't put this book down. What would you do if faced with Jule's situation ? Can't wait for<br /> DUST ! Right up there with BRAD MELTZER 's  nail biting<br />novels !
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i really enjoyed this book, even though it was quite sad and intense at times.<br />deals with several delicate and sensitive themes* in a thoughtful, humorous, insightful manner.<br />*cancer, adolescence...loss/grief and death
076115678X|4.0|This book was highly anticipated by me. It gave helpful information, but in the longrun most of the information, tips, and recipes are mostly aimed toward non ethnic hair types.
B004132I20|5.0|Brings an interesting take that is vastly different than the US Elementary(sorry folks I saw Elementary first).  I can't wait for more
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Installing Cloud Player and amazon MP3 player was my first excursion into putting music on my smart phone, which I, not being a digital native, was apprehensive of attempting; however, I could not resist the idea of getting something for nothing...so I timidly proceeded. I now feel like a bonafide &#34;tech-pro&#34;! It was easy, and I love having my favorite songs at the mere swipe of my finger. In addition, the sound is amazingly &#34;rich&#34; for such a small device.  Thanks, amazon!
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|If you have money in the market or just like the news then this is the app for you. It has news feeds about different places in the world as well as here, a moment by moment on the the exchange and also some other stuff. Just get it. Its free.
030758836X|5.0|My reaction after reading the first part of Gone Girl was 'huh'. I mean, what was all the fuss about. It was just the story of two people whose marriage was more toxic than the sum of their very unlikable parts. So I stopped reading. But curiosity got the better of me and I decided to read a few reviews to see if maybe I was missing something. Turns out a lot of people have the same reaction to the book's beginning. But they also all said that, once they got further into the story, it completely grabbed them and wouldn't let go until the rather disturbing ending. So I decided to persevere.<br /><br />I dived back into the story and damn if they weren't all telling the truth. This is one hell of a gripping tale. No, I never started to like either of the main characters and I never developed any deep (or even shallow) empathy for them. However, I sure enjoyed reading their story. Author Gillian Flynn is an expert at literary sleight of hand. The novel is littered with red herrings and the plot twists will make you dizzy. As these twists are revealed, I kept thinking I shoulda seen that coming except...well, I didn't And the ending - wow, it's days later and the ending is still beating me up. I know this has been said by hundreds of readers before me but READ THIS BOOK. It'll keep you up late, disturb your sleep, perplex, anger, and annoy you but, most of all, I guarantee it will be one of the best books you will read all year.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|The fire already has a program that is built in that does what this does. Don't bother with this as it will be a waste of bandwidth.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I picked this game up while it was the free app of the day and wasn't expecting much....however, this game has impressed me with its graphics, resposiveness, and ease of use.<br /><br />There are two primary modes you can play in. One where you start with a large cube comprised of multiple small cubes and try to match as many small cubes as you can...or you can play Attack of the Cubes mode where you start with a blank screen and cubes are added quickly. This is a good mode to play if you have a few minutes to focus and play a fast paced matching game.<br /><br />As mentioned before, the responsiveness of the app is great.  You will often have to rotate the mass of cubes around to find matches and it is impressive how smoothly this works
0670026603|5.0|This book made me cry and at times laugh right out loud. Louisa Clark is a quirky lady. She lives in a small tourist town in England. Her small life consists of; living with her family at age 27; a job at the small cafe; and a boyfriend she's been with for seven years. She is comfortable in her secure life. This all changes when the cafe closes down and she has to go on a job search. With no skills or training she takes a job as a caregiver for a rich effluent family.<br /><br />Growing up in the same small town Will Traynor is everything Louisa isn't. He's bold; an adventurer. He lives life on the edge and travels the world. He has a great job he loves and an extremely beautiful girlfriend. He lived a full life until one cold rainy England morning he was hit by a motorbike and became a quadriplegic.<br /><br />Two years after the accident all hope for recovery is lost and Will's drive to live is gone. The only thing he has to look forward to is more sickness and being completely controlled and dependent on his family. They hire Louisa as his caregiver because she is bubbly and talkative and they hope it would be bring Will out of his depression. Will and Louisa clash instantly and have nothing in common. Will is mean and rude to Louisa and she wants to quit, but her family depends on the money she is going to make. It's only a contract for six months and she figures she can endure his rudeness for at least that long.<br /><br />Over time Louisa begins to understand Will's frustration with his lifeless body and hopeless situation. She tries to plan activities to help him enjoy life again. Will's resistance, he has not spent much time outside of his home except for hospital visits. When Louisa learns of Will's plan to end his life with his parents consent, she is determined to change his mind. Spending all their time together Will and Louisa begin to enjoy each other and a familiar friendship grows. Will encourages Louisa to step out of her comfort zone and live life. You could never imagine in six months time a relationship grows between these two complete opposites.<br /><br />This is an unusual love story. JoJo's writing is engaging and funny. You really get inside two very different families lives. It will pull at your heart strings like you could never imagine. I like the question the back of the book asks. \\"What do you do when making the person you love happy means breaking your own heart?\\".

B004L07KWQ|4.0|My daughter loves to play with this app.  It's not complicated to learn and the random brushes and effects are really neat.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Great Driving game... worth the download for sure! Controls are good and the game plays very smoothly on my tablet.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Like the first two in the series, number three takes you on a fun journey with an interesting story line.  The young Tommy Lee Jones character is well cast, and Will Smith is great as usual.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Intriguing game with good design, good game play. It's easy to learn but still challenging. Lots of fun, very addicting.
B006O6F932|5.0|For the people having issues of the building falling over as I did there is a finger (hook) on the front side that connects and steadies the building. For some reason it wasn't in the instructions. Overall great piece. My 8 year old loves it!!!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a very interesting game, with a fun and unusual theme and unique game play. It is very easy to lrearn, but still manages to keep you entertained for long periods.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is loaded with fun and includes many challenging levels. The graphics are wonderful on my Kindle Fire. A+
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It's a great read for kids who think that no one's life is worse than theirs. Because people can have worse lives.
1250027624|4.0|Don't understand why Mary kept her problem from Matthew.  They share the same room and talk with each other quite a lot.  He's her husband and best friend...should count for something.  Also, not favorable toward the whole gay issue.  Sounds more like 21st century than beginning 20th century.  Back then, people believed in God's wrath for ungodly behavior.

Equally, it seems surprising that environmental governance across boundaries -- i.e. transboundary environmental regulation -- (especially in coastal and marine environments) is still considered to be more or less a growth area in the development of environmental regulation internationally. `A developing regime -- a work in progress' David Freestone calls it, writing in the foreword to this thought provoking book recently published by Ashgate.<br /><br />Putting the important research contained in this volume in perspective, David Freestone cites the Rio Declaration of 1992 and before that, the Stockholm Declaration of 1972, the latter of which laid out the first principles of what would come to be known as sustainable development.  Pointing out that before Stockholm there really was no discipline that could usefully be described as environmental law he notes that many of the themes and aspirations of both Stockholm and Rio are captured in this volume.<br /><br />Focusing its attention on environmental initiatives in Asia, Australasia and international areas, mainly Antarctica, this book will no doubt come to be regarded as a seminal work on environmental law and policy.  The editors - both from top Australian universities - have brought together a wide ranging body of research from ten additional expert contributors on, respectively, inland and coastal perspectives and marine perspectives, as the sub-title indicates.<br /><br />Particularly interesting to environmental lawyers are the discussions on -- and references to -- the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in a Transboundary Context negotiated under United Nations auspices - known as the Espoo Convention - named after Espoo in Finland where it was signed in 1991.  `Could the Espoo Convention Become a Global Regime for Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment?' asks the environmentalist Timo Koivurova, one of the contributors to this volume.  Anyone concerned about the environment globally would have to say `yes, let's hope so!'<br /><br />Here, then, is a thought provoking compendium of environmental research which really should be added to the library of any environmental lawyer.  What is particularly useful for further enquiry is the extensive footnoting throughout and mind-blowingly massive bibliography of almost thirty pages.  There are also detailed lists of figures and tables and a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />If you are in any way concerned about environmental issues, you should acquire this scholarly and informative book.

The publication of this book could not, therefore, be more timely!<br /><br />With world business and world communications having gone global, largely via the Internet, practitioners, as well as social workers and other interested parties should be made aware of the legal and practical complexities involved in inter-country adoption - an aim which this book certainly achieves.<br /><br />As the authors reiterate in the introduction, adoption is `a legal relationship of parent and child between a child and an adult who are not biologically related.'  Adoption, they imply, imposes an immense burden of responsibility for all adult parties concerned, as it is at best, an act of love, or at worst, an  opportunity for the abuse of power -- and it is always the welfare of the child that is of paramount consideration.<br /><br />This book covers the law and practice involved in this complex subject in a thorough, clear and easily accessible manner. Following the general introduction in Part 1, Part 2 examines international adoption when the United Kingdom is the receiving state - while Part 3 deals with international adoption when the UK is the state of origin. Part 3 specifically, will assist practitioners advising potential UK adopters who wish to adopt a child from abroad.<br /><br />Throughout the book's almost 700 pages, the reader is guided through the complexities of both UK legislation and the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, while at the same time being warned of certain pitfalls which may result in criminal charges.<br /><br />Note that  Part 4  `Glossary and Offences ` contains a Table of Offences and eighteen appendices which include the relevant statutory provisions as well as  immigration rules and forms.  Also note that adoption processes relating to non-Hague Convention countries are also covered.<br /><br />For ease of use - an important consideration for busy practitioners - the book has a detailed table of contents plus extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and international materials.  There is also a useful index at the back.<br /><br />Practitioners with international clients -- or UK residents wishing to adopt a child from abroad -- will find this book invaluable as a reliable and convenient way to increase their familiarity with this jurisdiction.  The law is stated as at 31 October 2012.of Offences and eighteen appendices which include the relevant statutory provisions as well as  immigration rules and forms.

0385523912|5.0|I checked this book out from the library when I saw it was about North Koreans.  As a former (South) Korean, I was really curious how life in North Korea really was, especially after meeting some this summer.  Since they weren't defectors, naturally they didn't really want to talk to foreigners about the life there.  Thus, this book was really great because you really see everything.  The descriptions were vivid; I could see everything that was happening in my mind. If you're at all curious about \\"Bukjoseon (북조선),\\" I'd recommend this for you!

As he readily acknowledges, much of his material is influenced by a range of learned publications from `The Philosophical Quarterly' to `The Modern Law Review' (in which he himself has published) and Intellectual Property Quarterly.<br /><br />He argues that `natural rights theories must include space for intellectual liberties, and so require the limitation of intellectual property rights, such as copyright and patent'.  Natural rights in the jurisprudential sense may also be interpreted, we assume, as `user's rights' frequently referred to in the text of this book.<br /><br />Intellectual property lawyers may make of all this what they will!  Writers, artists and designers working across a range of media and probably starving in garrets are likely to be rendered apoplectic.<br /><br />The author does point out that before 17th century there was no copyright law as we now know it.  One could argue that there was no mass literacy or mass media either before that period, in the form of the widespread use of the printing press, for example not to mention the thousands of other inventions that at the time had yet to be invented.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the author constructs a most interesting argument substantiated for the most part by copious and wide-ranging research as evidenced by the massive bibliography.  He relies greatly on the philosophy of John Locke and references a host of other thought provoking quotes from other thinkers on this vast subject, from Hume and Rousseau to, momentarily, that twentieth century darling of the far right, Ayn Rand, referred to as `libertarian'.<br /><br />On the whole, the author's thesis, although controversial, is carefully argued nonetheless and concludes that freedom, i.e. intellectual liberty, requires a balanced approach in general as well as in particular, to intellectual property rights. Students of philosophy as well as jurisprudence and legal theory will find much in this book to commend it.d apoplectic.<br /><br />The author does point out that before 17th century there was no copyright law as we now know it.

This book left me both satisfied and ambivilant; satisfied, because the ending of the series leaves the reader with the answers to most of the questions and storylines introduced... ambivilant, because the series that I've been reading now for over 20 years is over.

B00APUQRPC|3.0|I love Clint Eastwood, I love baseball, I even like Justin Timberlake in the films he's been in. But, I have to be honest, this was a rough watch. Very predictable, everything had a pretty little bow on it at the end of the movie. Bad guy fired, arrogant kid struck out by gifted son of a hotel employee,arrogant lawyer bosses regretting not making Amy Adams character a partner.This is what Hollywood is giving us and we eat it up. Justin Timberlake's scene where he pulls over and announces some random kids playing ball in a field. Seriously what the heck was that all about? I'm just as guilty as anybody, I rented it this against my better judgement.<br /><br />It's not the worst movie, it's a date night movie I guess. Nothing too controversial happens,one of the softest PG-13 movies I've seen in a while. Amy Adams in no Meryl Streep, but she's not the worst. This is really a 2-star affair, but Clint Eastwood and John Goodman get the extra star, even if Clint is the same exact character he was in Gran Torino.

006016848X|5.0|I was first introduced to this book by my partner back in the late 90's after it had been published and was just starting to receive widespread recognition. I found it absolutely fascinating right from the start. So much so that, as I was a consultant working in related areas, I tracked down the Mars Venus organization in the USA to try and get the rights to run training programs in Australia. I was informed that a couple in Melbourne had beaten me to it. Not to be deterred, I contacted them and to cut a long story short they trained and appointed me the agent for Sydney. I went to the USA to work with and observe Dr. John Gray to complete my accreditation and came back to Sydney all fired up to go and sell the programs. Unfortunately, I encountered 2 major problems:<br />1. Private couples were reluctant to outlay the necessary program fees out of their own pockets.<br />2. Businesses saw it as personal development and wouldn't pay for their employees to attend the training.<br />I also had some problems with the contractural arrangements so I subsequently decided to cut my losses and give up the license. That was disappointing but the venture was a great personal learning experience for me.<br />To get back to the book itself, the principles in it are revolutionary for relationships but they are not natural. What most people consider are normal and reasonable responses to communication problems between men and women simply don't work very well. Often, even if well intended they only make the situation worse.<br />The Mars Venus principles do work. Apart from my professional knowledge about it my partner and I found this out ourselves. We had a good relationship beforehand but by applying the Mars Venus principles our relationship improved out-of-sight. And the thing is, it would be almost impossible to figure it out for youself; you really have to be taught because the concepts are counter-intuitive, not what you would think would work.<br />Just recently, as I write this (February, 2013), there's been noise in the media about how the insights established by John Gray are now out of date and men and women are not really that different at all. Well, don't believe it. There are significant differences in the way the opposite sexes communicate and what each needs in a relationship. So, I suggest you buy the book and give it a try yourself. I'm certain you will be pleasantly surprised at the results.<br />Footnote: Whatever you do, don't make the mistake of buying the book and then giving to your partner to read with the aim of \\"fixing\\" them. That would just backfire on you. Instead, first read and apply the approaches yourself and then perhaps ask your partner to give you their opinion on a SMALL part of one appropriate chapter of the book.ite this (February, 2013), there's been noise in the media about how the insights established by John Gray are now out of date and men and women are not really that different at all.

It's about a young girl who ignites the people to oppose the cruel government and becomes the symbol of their rebellion. The government has a system where the children of the country are forced into a game of survival, called The Hunger Games, which ends only when all but one have been killed. The novel explores issues like starvation, extreme destitution, oppression and some pretty complicated emotions. It's worth a read.

0756405890|5.0|The first thing that strikes you about Rothfuss's debut novel is its originality. Set in an unnamed world, the novel has been perfectly executed with very little, if any, derivative work. It's the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of fantasy, yes, but with not so much as the hint of an elf or dwarf or other such creatures. The most prevalent things in the book are the protagonist's uncanny ability to get out of trouble, his passion for music and his magical abilities which quickly become legend. Set to an academic background, the university where Kvothe, the protagonist, studies magic and its related fields, the novel takes fantasy to a whole new level with a very fresh outlook. Fantasy lovers, this book will give you things you never expected.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found \\"No Easy Day\\" an intriguing account of the mission to catch UBL.  It's hard to imagine all the training and planning that Seal Team 6 went through.  These guys are truly American Warriors and we're lucky to have them on our side.<br />What I found confusing was the use of many military abbreviations.  Even though the author usually explained briefly what each accronym was once, there were so many of them, that they were easy to forget a few pages later.  I was still able to get the idea being presented but a non military person like myself would have preferred a more understandable dialogue.<br />I would recommend the book as it's an exciting story in American history.

B00000FYIL|4.0|I recall that one comment by another, negative reviewer was that this album's music doesn't evoke the spirit of the Renaissance -- though I think the person may have used the word Medieval. Anyway, no, you won't find much if any music of an Elizabethan spirit here. It's decidedly modern in that sense, mostly very moody, though the opening theme is bouncy and optimistic. Personally, I find this album emininently listenable, and the tracks pretty much move from one to the next in comfortable fashion, so there's no centrifugal, chaotic sense to the disc, which is sometimes the case with soundtracks. My only criticism is that some of the segments do tend toward the too quiet side, and sometimes become almost interchangable in mood. Still, there's enough variety and development and introspection to make the experience worthwhile. This isn't great, but it's no slouch, either. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars overall, but that opening theme, all too brief, bumps it to 4.

B009369Z8A|2.0|My grandson requested this on his Amazon wish list so I bought it for him.  We rented the movie and watched it later.  I thought it was violent and depressing, but the rest of the family really likes it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'll recommend this product to anyone, My advise to those buying expensive gear is &#34;Stop showing off&#34; an grow up. No one cares what you use and how much you spent on it...the bottom line is quality!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great movie that explains why sound city was so important to the music business and how it made bands who they are today
B0085RZGYU|5.0|I have become a huge David Baldacci fan over the past few months.  Hell's Corner was an excellent read because the members of the Camel Club were the main characters once again.  There were quite a few twists in the book which made it difficult to put down!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. The characters came alive and I was totally drawn in. I am looking forward to the sequel.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I haven't seen him in a bad movie yet, and this one is top notch. And ya just don't know what's gonna happen as this movie progresses. Highly recommended.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|really keeps you on your toes. much more of a task than the first version. many more obsticles. every thing seems to happen much quicker.
0761169431|5.0|I got this for my brother-in-law to do origami with my nephew and they are thrilled!  Very happy with the purchase!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a book like no other. It is an incredible ride through the eyes of a deeply troubled boy.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We saw it in the theater. What else to say? This copy is for a young archer! And her family who are also archers.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Surprisingly entertaining!<br />Unlike higher stress timed puzzles, this one is not as judgemental of sluggish play with lots of mistakes. Yet, there is still plenty of incentive to get faster and more accurate, if you can. That puts this game into a nice nitch, between bubble-blasters and quell-type games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome. My heart goes out to the characters in this book.  The writer kept me waiting breathlessly for the next chapter.  You have to read this story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was totally worth it it was awesome its challenging they always are making new places to go and u don't have to say it messes up to much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it like the pc It has armor now it's the best thing ever it not one of those wannabes it the real thing
B004DM0UII|4.0|love it has good sound and I find the music I like!  i would recommend it to others to try !!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have used avast on my computer for years I think it is the best anti virus and severity software out there
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is really similar to Temple run except you dont have to tilt your device to play. Once I start playing I cant seem to stop but it is so fun that I don't seem to mind.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Last book in the trilogy, good ending, worth the read.<br />Will look for other books by Collins, have never read her before.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This has been one of the saddest, funniest, most honest books I've ever read. I hate that people peg this as a coming-of-age teen novel.. it's really so much more than that. All I can say is that this is one of the most beautiful pieces I've had the pleasure to read.
0316232955|4.0|A very fun and interesting book to read, highly recommend it for fans of The Perks of Being a Wallflower.<br />I read Chris Colfer's previous book The Wishing Spell, and thoroughly enjoyed that, and this one was just as good. I eagerly await his next book.
0399246665|3.0|As usual when it comes to Eric carle the isno question about his drawings. They are just awesome. But the format it is not the best one. Although probably vey didactic, it's just hard to turn the pages. Maybe with time and use it gets better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just loved it. So easy going and simple. The characters are so well connected. I loved sky and holder. Ahh what a beautiful story! Everything is so beautiful about this book. I can't point at a single thing and say it could have been better. So real.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I really liked this movie for the fact that it gets you to think about nature and life without the monetary possessions. Great soundtrack!
B00B2QA646|5.0|I highly recommend the movie! Having read the book I couldnt wait to see this new interpretation of this classic love drama. It completely enthralled and captivated me. The staging, acting, costumes and music are just so incredibly good - I stayed up late watching it at home and now I cannot stop thinking about it. I highly recommend it! Joe Wright created a masterpiece!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|The second of a yet to be finished Century Trilogy, Winter of the World picked up where the first of the three Fall of Giants left off.  Unlike another reviewer who lamented the jump in time following the end of Fall of Giants about 1920, Winter picks up with the daughters and sons of the main characters in Fall take over the narrative through their eyes from early 1930's during the lead up to WW2.<br /><br />The story moves along at a steady pace with, as I say, the main characters being the sons and daughters but the parents still feature to a more or lesser extent simply because of their relationship with the children.  Some of the parents play active roles in the historical events whilst others fade quietly into the background - eg Earl Fitzherbert.  I think Follett has done another incredible job of recounting the turbulent history of that period through the involvement of the characters with the events and the coincidences that arise add a depth of interest to the characters.<br /><br />I am not one for really pontificating as to the style of writing etc - I enjoy a good read and found this as much a page turner as the first and look forward to seeing how Follett carries the characters and their offspring into a period of my life that I am currently living in.<br /><br />I recommend this and the first of the trilogy as enjoyable insights through the characters into the history of major events in the early-mid 20th Century.
B0095VP8D4|4.0|Was able to build a decent PC from the ground up for around $600 (including monitor) using this chip. Great setup for multi-media, and good for gaming if you're not too concerned with the highest end graphics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best!!!!! I play it all the time and always go for another high score. this is way better then temple run 2. get this app now
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was really good! I never thought that I would actually like it but I do. And it reminds me of twilight and that was a good book too. And it was a love story mixed with fantasy also.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very good, challenging game... a lot like Mahjong, only better.  Mahjong has boring tiles... Love the bright-colored tiles in this one!
B00846F1YW|3.0|Mysteryville 2 is one of those games best described as mediocre.  It was good, but not great!  The game loaded easily, no glitches or locking up and the graphics were good. Unfortunately there was absolutely no detective work involved insolving the mystery.  The game consists of mostly hidden object games with a few &quot;arrange the pieces to solve the puzzle&quot; type scenes. The rest of the game is comprised of a LOT of annoying dialog boxes and hopping back and forth between the same 6 or 7 scenes.  The HO games were VERY repetitious.  You are directed to a location (without the option of going elsewhere!), you are given a list of 20 or so items to find, then (while on the same scene), you are shown the shapes of 20 or so items you need to find.  This pattern is repeated for every screen.  You also end up back on each scene 2 or 3 times.  It really does get annoying! Frankly, it would have been a much better game if the creators had just left off all the dialog boxes and added more HO games!  Anyway, if you can get the game for free, give it a try.  But if you have to pay for it,  save your money and invest in a MumboJumbo game.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I'll admit it, I'm slightly embarrassed to give this book more than one star, but at least I finished it. Six months after I started and one delayed cross country flight layer, it's over. If you can suspend belief in the story line, and stop yourself from saying these characters are stupid and crazy every few pages, it at least is an entertaining read.
0817439390|5.0|Great book by a great author.  Bryan Peterson conveys the message well and keeps it interesting.  I have learned a lot from this book.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I read all the other reviews and was not put off by references to Forrest Gump and history lessons. I know it stretched the credibility but that was the appeal. It was fresh, different and always readable. I enjoyed it from start to finish.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|These are very dependable, easy to use and compact card readers.  Would be nice if it had a status light.  It is a little hard to figure out which way to plug it in sometimes, but if it doesn't work the first time, pull it out, turn it over and plug it back in.  This one has been through a wash and dry cycle and survived along with a 16G Micro SD card.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have several bingo game on my Iphone, but this game only allowed me to play one or two games and then it told me I did not have any more credits.  Needless to say I do not play this bingo game any more.
B00AG51RU6|5.0|Great action fliick,it kept you on the edge of your seat.<br />I don't do reviews very good,so what I said in the begining<br />was it,but I do recomend this film if you are a Bruce Willis<br />fan & like action movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesomeness very fun amazing love the game and have loved it since I bought it a while back<br />It is truly epic
B004LR5K0I|5.0|I bought this for my mom & she gives it high praises.<br />She is a great Elvis fan & this item is one of the best of her<br />collection.She really liked it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is Josh Grobans Best CD yet.  It's hard to imagine him getting any better<br />than all of his excellent CD's, but this is 5 Stars. Love all the songs!
B003FSTN52|5.0|While this is legally very shaky it is dramatically fabulous.  The women characters are all terrific and the plots clever.  Good investment
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I thought the first season was good - very good because it put characters in difficult moral dilemmas and forced them to make decisions.  It also includes great action.  Season 2 does this and much more than the first.  It's rare that part 2 of any movie or tv series is better than the first , but season 2 of the Walking Dead accomplishes just this by adding depth to the characters, posing more complex moral dilemmas, asking tougher questions based on faith, and creating more suspense.<br /><br />Several themes emerge in this series, including:<br /><br />SURVIVAL - what does it take to survive?  How far do you have to go?  Do you have to compromise values and principles you held in a different setting?<br />GROUP LEADERSHIP - when a world crumbles, who decides who leads a group of people?  What are the qualities of that leader?  And how do you decide who you can trust and who is loyal to you?<br />CIVILIZATION - how is a civil society defined?  Is it possible to maintain civilization as we know it hen a world crumbles?<br />FAMILY - how do you raise a child in a cruel world or can you?<br />FAITH - how much of a role does faith play in survival?  If there is a God, why would he allow the world to come to the world of the Walking Dead?  Are the characters fighting for survival acting on faith by staying alive one day at a time?<br /><br />Shane argues that you have to be cutthroat to survive in this new world.  Maybe to some degree he is right - that a different set of rules apply.  But the question of whether or not a person's values and principles change in the face of more extreme behaviour in a cruel world is a different question entirely - just because a person has to be tougher in a different situation doesn't mean they don't carry the same values.<br /><br />This seasons offers some answers to these complex questions and lets the audience agree or disagree. It is also filled with great action and suspense.<br />I never thought I'd watch a show that could match Dexter, but this show comes awefully close.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I thought that this book was very twisted when I first picked it up. But as I continued to read on, the book became very powerful and full of meaning, something I wonder if the author ever intended.<br /><br />The events that took place as the reason for this young girl's suicide make so much sense but only if you're willing to understand things from her state of mind. At first I didn't understand why the depressed girl took events and twisted them to be more negative than they actually were. But again, she was DEPRESSED and that needs to be understood. The reasons for why she was originally depressed are unknown but there are several factors that can play into someone's life.<br /><br />When I finally was able to get the full understanding of how things/people/events affected her, I was heartbroken.<br /><br />It enables you to realize that one little smart comment you make about something can be a huge factor as to how they preceive themselves and what they want to do with it. It may be the first thing that pushes someone over to be angry, sad, or whatever emotion or it could be the VERY LAST thing they needed.<br /><br />Very serious book and I think it should be read, especially by those in their early teen years.
B006L7RDOC|5.0|I bought this book for my Kindle and I love it.  It was cheap, which was great, and I love the book.  Its really interesting and a fun read!
B0018KSB5C|5.0|I loved it awesome movie & format, High def. blue ray is great!!. I would recommended to everybody it's woth the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great  game:) not only to just pass the time. You actually come to love the horse who even if she's not real she's still sweet.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|All in this series is superb: script, acting, emotions, ideas. David Fincher was involved in the project and the final result has the look of his films: clean, well composed, crisp and with a superlative attention to detail.<br />See it. You won't regret it.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|very awesome movie i think better than first very original and excellent too exciting keeps you on your toes a must see
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Historically I have not liked Bond movies. They were okay, but seemed almost like kids movies. I like the direction the newer ones have been going since bringing on Daniel Craig, even though his face looks like Babe Ruth's baseball glove. I think of the 3 he made this one is the best. It had the most compelling story and had a very good mixture of action. Overall I think it was a well balanced and well made movie, certainly worth renting.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|i cant believe i even rented this movie........... i mean REALLY!!!!!!!! this was the worst PA ever. i hope they dont come out with another one. REALLLYYYY !!!!!!! WoW<br /><br />Im sorry buts thats all i have to say.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Brought this CD for my daughter, she loved the music!!! This was a CD she wanted right away, product is very good!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Haven't read a book in awhile and have seen the movie a trillion times and that it was awesome, but isn't anything compared to the book! Impeccable imagery! Love this book!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Definitely better than the first,better graphics,a tad bet easier than the first Temple Run.And also very fun, awesome, and cool
B004SEUIXS|5.0|This movie has whimsy plus romance. Amelie is a delightful character seeking love, and surprise,<br />she finds it! Great film for people who still believe, optimistically, that love is out there. Hurrah for the<br />traveling gnome, too.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|blast from the past,fun too play!. great graphics!. hours and hours of play time.  great ay too pass the time fast while traveling by car or plane. makes those long trips short.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a well done, well acted piece and a look into aristocratic life before and after the war.  It is funny, witty and surprising.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I read this years ago and only went back to it when it turned up on TV. The characters are great but there are just way too many of them I get confused! It;s mainstream fantasy and nothing that really pushes the genre.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A wonderful app. Does all that it is supposed to do. I am very happy with this and it has already proven very useful
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was a great download. The whole fan loves it, mom dad, 99 yr old daughter and 9yr old son
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I adore this movie! It's action packed and will tug at your heart strings, but in the end you'll be on your feet clapping. Definitely worth the buy!
B0090NNQX6|5.0|Awesome songs by a super talented artist - every song is a winner - great voice -you will not be disappointed
0061122416|5.0|Really interesting to read and worth every penny. There are plenty of life lessons locked away within its pages and it's easy to read
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is my son's favortie band and he has turned me on to them, big time.  This is by far my favorite of their compilations.  Awesome.  Get it.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I adore this movie! It's action packed and will keep you on the edge of your seat, but in the end you'll be on your feet clapping. As a Marvel fan, I give it two thumbs way up! Definitely worth the buy!
0783225857|5.0|I watch this movie at least once a month. Gregory Peck is the perfect Addicus,and the kids were so comfortable and real.Sometimes things are not what they seem and we can be very surprised by the ending. love it
0393964582|5.0|Easy to read and interesting, I was reading chapters ahead of where we were in class and continued reading past the required pages. It really sucks you in and holds your attention. Loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it has good reviews it has good graphics and I just love it buy this game and rate it it's a good game.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I absolutely adore this series, so to find this on Amazon was a dream come true! It holds your attention and it never gets old. I've watched the entire series at least 5 times and I still love it. Definitely worth the buy!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Classic Grisham. Likeable underdog takes on the establishment with expected results. Formulaic. Happy I read it and happier still that I didn't buy it.
0393976041|5.0|Easy to read and interesting, I was reading chapters ahead of where we were in class and continued reading past the required pages. It really sucks you in and holds your attention. Loved it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best series I have seen. The characters are so well developed the history woven in seamlessly and the stories intriguing. It's a series that is like reading an excellantLeonardo book and joining the family. I want it not to end.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|very entertaining, good effects, decently dialogged, good photography and overall good editing. I like this series of action movies. Namaste'
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good book, holds your attention through the whole series.  I am looking forward to reading more from this author.
B007R21JJK|1.0|So i get my motherboard today and the packaging was opened and the the port where the cpu goes was totally scratched up<br />as though someone else had it sent it back.  Totally ticked off right now.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This movie is funnier and more clever than when I saw it 25 years ago.  The ingenious story and directing and acting are more affirming than ever.
1449410243|1.0|This book was probably meant for humor.  The topics, individually, are distinctly not funny, however.  Most especially the not so veiled attack on homosexuals.  Because of this content, I have not shared the book, and am trying to decide whether to return it, or simply burn it.  I lean toward the latter, thus preventing the circulation further of at least this copy!
B004SIPAJG|5.0|This story is very unique in the romantic and dance genre.  Combines both in a clever story.  Very well directed and acted.
B009UZLRJE|4.0|I was thrilled to order this, especially since it was such a great price for the full 5 seasons on BluRay. However, when I got it, one of the season packages was broken and the disc holder tends to fall out of the box. Great quality other than that, just a little disappointing to have an already broken case.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Im actually rather amused with this game. It's rather fun and gives you plenty to do. Been playing it for awhile and even got my friends into it.
B0058SNIC6|5.0|Bought these for my daughter and she says they are so comfortable. I chose this item from her wish list so she really wanted these.
B000SEI230|5.0|As always Nicholas Sparks writes another great book, just always have to make sure when you read them that you're not in public since you might get wet eyes.....
B004MC8CA2|4.0|You don't have to pay $50 for &#34;The Listener's Bible&#34; to hear Max McLean's dramatic reading. It's all right here FOR FREE!<br /><br />Just open the included NIV version and play the audio. Surprise, it's Max!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was very different but in a good way, and it was recommended by many. If you have a chance to read this deliciously dirty book then do so.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|I like steam, steam likes me, me and steam are friend. Steam lets me talk to my other friends, while showing me amazing sales on games, you should get steam, steam is fun, steam and you should be friends where you can get games on your computer and talk to friend, I like steam steam likes me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun to pass time. I love my horse. Love the training sessions. Cant w a it to buy a new horse...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the type of book that I would share with my girlfriends, my mother, father, etc.  Good beach read.
B009IAN56E|5.0|If thought the girls were great at covers, than you should hear their album. One word can describe their music. PERFECTION
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think it a all around good game!!!! You get discounts on the gold you need to buy things. But even if you don't spend money it's still a good game been playing for 4 months now.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is an all-action gritty film that delivered! I remember watching the 1985 'Judge Dredd' with Stallone and thought for many years how cool an adaptation of this calibre would be. I had to have it when it was released!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|This movie will be the favorite of many serious fans of this genre for many years to come.  It reminds me of A Nightmare before Christmas.
B005LAII12|5.0|Of course it´s not everybody´s humor - if you are easily offended by vulgar language you should probably choose something else for your girly slumber party. If you´re familiar with and enjoy the kind of humor Seth McFarlane is known to employ, I think you have a very good chance of having a lot of fun watching it.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|One of the most literate scripts with fine actors and a great story which lends itself to a sequel.  Many thanks.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|The build quality and operation are near perfect. I bought this to have a desktop volume control for some Audioengine 2 speakers, which have a very uncomfortable volume control on the back of the left speaker. When I first installed the Powermate on Windows 7 64-bit it would go to sleep on me if I didn't use it for five minutes, and I would have to click on the taskbar icon to wake it up. But then I tweaked the application to be compatible with Windows Vista, and it works perfectly, precisely, and permanently. Great device and very sleek.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great arrangements - piano and cello - that are innovative yet not so far out that you can appreciate recognizing the tunes. Love all thier YouTube videos and this CD did not let me down.
081297381X|1.0|I get it.  The author has read more books than I ever will. He knows the names of philosophers that I never heard of. He has rubbed elbows with some outstanding scientists. Unfortunately, none of that has led to a logical and useful work.<br />This book commits just about every sin a philosopher and logician can commit. He uses flawed logic to attack everyone who disagrees with him (with special venom for statisticians, economists, and all but a few \\"enlightened\\" philosophers). He makes his argument by falsely describing their methodologies to create a straw man that he can knock down. As one example of this, he correctly demonstrates that various systems are not Gaussian. The first thing one learns as an undergraduate is that you must test a system to determine if its behavior is Gaussian before you apply Gaussian statistics. His style is so pompous and arrogant that I am pushed to disagree with him even when he is right. It is true that there are people who misapply statistics. It is true that there are nonlinear systems. It is true that low probability, high impact events are, to a great extent, unpredictable and can have a major effect in the world. That, in fact, is one of the foundations of good risk management. I.e., setting up early warning systems to discover previously unknowable events that are arising and developing plans for how one might deal with them when they are manifest. The author makes a big deal that Chapters 15 and 17 are only for those who want to delve into the technical details of his arguments. These are perhaps the worst sections of the book. They are oversimplified, unsophisticated explanations, even when his conclusions are correct. The arguments are technically flawed and insulting to anyone with a scientific background.<br />The ideas in this book could have been presented in less than 50 pages.  The rest is drivel. I can only guess that the large number of positive comments come from people who know very little mathematics. In the end this book is 90% bashing people he disagrees with and 10% a weak attempt to prove his point.d this book is 90% bashing people he disagrees with and 10% a weak attempt to prove his point.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|This movie is just proof of how a person can manipulate the facts to create the outcome they want.<br />As a resident of Dimock PA I know the people claiming that there water is ruined by fracking.<br />It's a lie!  They had problems before any fracking in this area, they used to have parties and light<br />their water on fire!  This happens naturally and has nothing to do with fracking.<br /><br />This movie is just one lie after another.  Pennsylvania doesn't have one well that's polluted.<br />This author is getting rich on his lies.  Watch Fracknation if you want the truth about fracking.
0345505387|1.0|I only bought this because I believed I was going to get Jamie's perspective on the early Outlander days.  Instead I was provided a horrid graphic novel where every face could have been interchangeable - unless breasts were involved, in which case, one could tell who-was-who by their size.  Good heavens! And what did Murtagh's perspective add?  Nothing, zero, nada, zilch!  Point of fact, I would have appreciated more Murtagh and history about him than was provided in the all too short format.  Yes, dear reader, it was a graphic novel, I realize that, but I also realize when I've been had! Wish so much I could get my money back!
B0090SI42Y|2.0|I'm serious, I watched for 40 minutes and then turned it off. Can't believe I bought a BluRay of this! Was so hoping it would be \\"ok\\" instead of the terrible it was. Other's are correct about it coming off looking and sounding like a 70s Kung Fu movie. The acting was horrible. Crow looked like he weighed in at a fat 250-260 pounds. All the bungy-cord jumping was just way over the top, and became just plain stupid after the first 10 minutes of the movie. Blah, I could go on and on about this movie, but what's the point?!<br /><br /> I gave it 2 stars just for the few special fx that were pleasing to the eye.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I thought it might drag on a little (kind of like history), but 11/22/63 is really well written....grabs you the instant you start reading.  The possibilities are endless and interesting.  Great book!
B008XBCJ34|3.0|Movie in 3D is great. For a special edition DVD, packaging is nothing to shout about except the 3D cover.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This series was extremely violent, but I carried on to the end. In many ways it provides an analogy  to our own increasingly powerful central government and increasingly dilute family and moral values. The triumph of good over evil, even at great cost, was welcome. The power of one was exemplified here and redeemed the violence.
B0063M22QO|5.0|makes the time go by faster than most other games and you stand a chance of beating the computer. this game is also very family friendly too so great for those long trips.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Date: 1992 (or thereabouts). Location: upper middle-class suburb outside Philadelphia PA. Voiceover: troubled-teen Charlie (Logan Lerman) is writing a letter to `Dear Friend' about his nervousness entering public high school the following day. He'll be a freshman, & has no friends, due to a recent hospitalization forced by a mental breakdown. Following scene, we see a lonely Charlie navigating the halls of his high school, trying to avoid upper-classmen's pranks. He does have a short meeting with a sympathetic English teacher (Paul Rudd), who tells him `you make a new friend every day'. Charlie replies `honestly sir, if the only friend I make today is my English teacher, that's a little depressing.'<br /><br />But there is a bright spot: Charlie sees a senior, Patrick (Ezra Miller) clowning in his Woodshop class. When the teacher enters & calls Patrick `Patsy', Patrick answers `My name is Patrick. Call me that or nothing.' Soon, everyone is calling him `Nothing'.<br /><br />At the Homecoming Football game, Charlie enters the stands alone, but sees Patrick in the bleachers, also alone. He moves up to speak with him, & they're soon joined by Sam (Emma Watson). Sam is Patrick's step-sister, only Charlie doesn't realize that initially; he thinks they're a couple.<br /><br />Patrick & Sam are both seniors, but allow Charlie to become part of their circle of friends. Patrick also happens to be an out-&-proud gay, who's dating the very-closeted quarterback of the football team.<br /><br />Some incidents in the film include driving through a tunnel to `Heroes' on the radio (inexplicably, NONE of the 3 friends recognize the song), & participation in the town showing of `The Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Patrick's Dr Frank N Furter is 1 of the prettiest since Tim Curry's!<br /><br />All performances are really good; Ms Watson handles an American accent admirably. However, Ezra Miller as Patrick is just ELECTRIC. Every scene that includes him just sparkles.<br /><br />The main question I left with (other than the `Heroes' one) is why do a bunch of seniors immediately welcome a freshman into their group? When I was in school, that simply didn't happen.<br /><br />Still, 5 stars.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I bought the film after reading the book (3 times!) Octavia Spencer really deserved the Oscar for her performance as Minnie, and the entire cast really captured the personalities of the four main women characters. The film adaptation of the book closely mirrored the plot of the book and both are an excellent look back at the turmoil of the civil rights struggles and prevailing attitudes of the turbulent '60s. Every bit as good a film as was &#34;Mississippi Burning.&#34; Worth viewing more than once. I have watched my copy numerous times.
B0098460O4|5.0|I was one of those that burst into tears of joyous shock and pleasure when first hearing shy, slightly awkward Jonathan sing on Britain's Got Talent.  If you love to listen to a magnificent tenor in your musical roster, this will may just bring you to tears, as well. it is not an exaggeration to say he is our new Pavoratti, made all the more astonishing by the fact he is just 17 years old.  My favorite song, of course, is The Prayer, in the full version you can't get on You Tube. I much prefer Jonathan and Charlotte to Andrea and Celine!  It blows them away (and I am fans of their talent as well).  Let me not neglect lovely Charlotte -- her clear, tone perfect, lovely voice has even improved -- land is a perfect compliment to all of the songs. Bless them both, and  hope we enjoy their tremendous talents for years to come. Apparently Simon Cowell is good for something, eh? :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun but a little fast paced.  the tutorial can be confusing if you're not used to this type of game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This series was extremely violent, but I carried on to the end. In many ways it provides an analogy  to our own increasingly powerful central government and increasingly dilute family and moral values. The triumph of good over evil, even at great cost, was welcome. The power of one was exemplified here and redeemed the violence.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|A well written novel and a great commentary on the human condition. Hard to put this one down. Going to get the next and see if it's as good.
B004GYY714|5.0|While vacationing in Hawaii we listened to a wonderful radio station.  With TuneIn Radio we are able to enjoy the same station in Colorado!
B002RSDW8A|5.0|As always, Meryl Streep is superb in this role. Stanley Tucci gives an excellent performance as Paul Child. Having read both books the movie was based on, I can say whoever did the screenplay for this film did an admirable job. I have watched this film numerous times and never get tired or bored with it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is about the best free weather app I found for my Kindle Fire. It is always running in the background, and gives periodic updates via the banner along the top of the tablet screen. Seems to give pretty accurate weather forecasts. I would recommend this app for anyone.
B009B8YZIK|1.0|I've seen more action in a Muppet Movie.  You watch a group of recruits &#34;getting to know each other&#34; through most of the movie.  The action doesn't start until the last half hour of the show when the aliens arrive, then it looks like a panty raid in the dark with fire crackers going off..  The aliens are hardly visible for more than a few seconds.  Its more like a reality show/soap opera.  This movie was a total waste of time and money.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I was overwhelmed with the gratuitous violence and the listing of character after character and boat after boat and description after description that had nothing to do with the story! If the author was writing a screen play he should not have put it into a novel. In a screen play you can more easily dismiss all these extras and not worry &#34;Am I going to need to remember these characters?&#34; Where were the editors?
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book,  I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.<br /><br />In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).<br /><br />Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.<br /><br />The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are  still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.<br /><br />My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye.and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.<br /><br />My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|My husband is enjoying this game.  Our grandson loves it also.  A bit frustrating but lots of fun.  Determined to master!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I did a random search online for a good Christian movie to watch around Easter, and this came up.  I'm a Catholic with a degree in Ancient History, so the setting sounded interesting.  When I saw it, I was shocked that I had never heard of it before.  For me, it is at least as good, if not better, than &#34;The Ten Commandments.&#34;  The acting is OUTSTANDING across the board!<br />  The love story is fraught with difficulty and strength.  The writers' interpretation of the political situation was interesting and entertaining, and the religious message was inspiring.<br />  The movie has its fair share of historical inaccuracies, but it doesn't take away from the story.<br />  I highly recommend this film!  It's in my top five favorites!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I blew through this book in three days. It sucked me in with it's theme of struggling to survive and the unimaginable world of extreme oppression of a people.
1439190275|5.0|This is a great book, explains the diet so well, after 4 weeks 9.7 pounds down can't beat that !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't order this book and wouldn't read it! From the hype surrounding the novel, I believe it is a Romance novel dressed in sheep's clothing and is attempting to attract readers who ordinarily wouldn't waste their time on this genre'.<br />I don't know how to remove this book from the list of items I have purchased, but I would if I could.
B000002C1V|3.0|Pink Floyd's 1983 concept album The Final Cut finds the band without keyboardist Richard Wright and with the sole artistic direction of Roger Waters, who acts as the sole writer, co-producer and singer for 88% of the record. The album is made up of a large amount of leftover songs from The Wall's sessions, which were then re-worked lyrically to fit the album's concept of a critique towards British military action upon the 1982 Falklands War, Margaret Thatcher's initiative towards it, and (to quote Waters) the unreal notion of an ever-peaceful \\"post-war dream\\", present since World War II (in which Waters' father lost his life). It received mixed reviews upon its release and David Gilmour has often expressed severe dislike towards the record. It would also be Roger Waters' final studio album with Pink Floyd.
1936608898|4.0|While it has some shades of Atkins behind it, I do think this is a book everyone should read.  Even if doing it 100% doesn't appeal to you, the more you do, the better you will feel and look.
B0040I09RM|4.0|This show is a little violent and there are a lot of sexual references.  I liked it but would recommend it to the violent sensitive peeps, like my wife!

B00133KFGW|4.0|Very heartwarming movie, good for all ages. I would certainly buy it again. Wish there were more movies like this one.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|It was a great movie, I enjoyed it very much. I watched it bits at a time so that doesn't give me the best perspective,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Truly amaing. Best book I think I have ever read. A real tear jerker and very well written in my opinion
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a great game and really fun if you love horses. the only problem is it takes for ever to load sometimes.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The game is super fun and smooth graphics, resposive touch on Samsung Galaxy SII, Note 10.1. But...for such a long game to finish one round, there should be some way to save progress so I can quite and pick up where I ledt off. -1<br />  UPDATE: I guess if you play it a lot, it deserves 5-stars. The app seriously needs to be able to choose music (I just turn down the volume). It's still frustrating to not save progress before closing, maybe the developer will mod sometime in the future. Great gameplay...smooth graphics...small file size...and low low permissions helps this app achieve 5-stars.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|So, Gotye wins a Grammy--aren't I prescient!<br />Fine voice, excellent lyrics...........that 's all for now now  now now now now

0345803485|5.0|When I first started reading this I thought it was going to be just a romance novel and wondered what why there was so much talk going around about this book. I'm glad I kept going because after about page 105, it got very interesting. So well written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It answered all the questions I had after watching the movie...book was WAY better and the movie was pretty good. Definitely read it even if u saw the movie
B0087X728K|5.0|I followed the tutorial online from the manufacturer, even though there are many ways to spread this compund online, I decided to follow the one from the manufacturer, so far my CPU is ok.!
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I saw this movie on TV many years ago. I never knew the title of it. I must have asked 100's of people what the movie was called. Finally it took my son to marry a very, very smart young lady who told me she saw it too but remembered the title. This movie is so exciting to watch as the time machine moves through years backward and forward to reveal what no one else could see! My grandkids thought there was such a thing possible! Very good material to watch! It's almost like the movies Sherlock Homes! You will love this on for sure!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|How did it take so long for America to discover this voice?<br />Very strong lyrics, excellent musicianship, cool tunes.  Buy it (if you can find it.)
0756666937|5.0|My son and I have enjoyed so much going through this great book.... Lego history at its best. I strongly recommend this book to any parent that has a child who loves Legos

B004JN1CW4|3.0|It wasn't the greatest ending but I'm satisfied. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes apocalyptic series.  The first two books were better.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|lots of action, good story line, leaves you feeling worn out and satisfied that the bad guys can be beat.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This DVD set was at a great price! We bought 2 sets. I loved he extras. We had a long week watching all the good stuff! I recommend it for all you Star Wars lovers. It came so fast in he mail too!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks.  Quick read...can't wait for the movie! I would definitely recommend this book to friends and book clubs.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White is just off the hook good. I've been a fan of Jack White and the White Stripes for years and this album doesn't disappoint. It has a more refined and creative sound as compared to some of his other work. If you're a Jack White fan then this is a killer example of how he absolutely does NOT fit a mold. His multifaceted musical style really shines in this album and doesn't seem to range too far out in any one direction. Well balanced is the term I'm looking for to describe this album. Great stuff!
B005MMY5RK|5.0|What a fantastic movie (like you need my review to know that!).  It bears viewing decade after decade.  It always leaves me amazed.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book because of the sweet love story and the exciting mystery that was so skillfully intertwined.  This is the first book by Nicholas Sparks that I've read, but have seen some of the .movies based on the books he's written.  My favorite was The Notebook.  Can't wait to read his other books!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|sup guys yea its the bible ya know so uh yea yea it is about god and its  for catalics go go
0446547654|2.0|Great service. This story by M. Sparks was boring, boring boring! I hope he does not make a movie of it. He needs to do something else. Sometimes he reminds me of Taylor Swift songs. Boring. Change the record.
0823015033|5.0|This book has so much info can't wait to have the time to try it out.  I love all the detail with how much and what size. The pictures are priceless.
B007M45PMU|2.0|Kept hearing about this band; kept seeing them lumped in with the likes of Mumford and Sons (sorry, not even close). Seem to be largely a product of hype.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This has to be the prime example of how a documentary should be - equally as good with sound turned off!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a game commonly played by many people. It is a thrilling game and just gets faster and faster the more you progress. However,once the game is finished, it becomes boring and tiresome. This is why they add updates: and the challenge starts again!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Overall, it's a fun game.  BUT I'm not spending money for gems therefore I can't buy any of the cool stuff.  Wish there was another was to earn gems.

B000002O4X|5.0|What can I say?  Love the music.  Can't beat the price either.  Sound quality excellent.  Arrived quickly.  I listen while driving in the car and it's very calming.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I would not play WOW without my G13 gamepad! I am the envy of my guildmates, it makes my rotations so very easy.
0547564651|4.0|Even as I was reading \\"How Children Succeed\\"  I was wondering if this is not really the most important book in the world.  Based upon scientific research the book gives clear guidelines on how we can make every child a worthy citizen of the world. Isn't this the greatest thing that could happen to mankind?  The gist of the book concludes that rather than academics, if parents and schools were to focus on developing the character in a child, the child will be successful in life.  In other words, though we think that academic excellence leads to holistic success, actually it is character which leads to both.  When two things happen together we usually think that one is the cause of the other, but it might be that both are the effect of a yet unknown cause (in this case character).  Character attributes to be inculcated from childhood are - self control, managing emotions, ability to delay gratification, curiosity, conscientiousness, grit (determination to succeed despite failures)    Character is malleable. If we teach children to pay attention to character, their character will improve. It's not that some children are good and some are bad. Some children have good habits and some have bad habits.    The book talks about an almost one-on-one relationship between stress caused by Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) and negative adult outcomes. Stress could be because of family turmoil, low level of maternal attachment, high level of parental criticism, isolation from parents - both physical and emotional.  Stress causes damage to a child's development because the human body is in a perpetual state of high alert leading to wear and tear of internal organs.    On a positive note, high quality mothering can counter the effect of unavoidable stress. Hearteningly, it has been scientifically proven that a spontaneous motherly cuddle can actually eliminate the damaging effects of stress.  The book has many more valuable insights and I recommend it to everyone. The importanceof the book is not just for parents. It is for the entire adult community who can use this knowledge to build a better society.    [...]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how you don't have to tilt your device in order to collect coins. Although temple run2's powerups-pickups-layout is better
0812550706|3.0|I very much enjoyed the book.  I was looking forward to reading the rest of the series until I found out that Card is on the board of directors for the national organization for marriage.  I cannot support an author who opposes the rights of others.  If this had been in his bio on Amazon I would not have purchased to begin with.  5 stars for the book 0 stars for the author.
B000085RPU|1.0|This format does not work on ps3 or Xbox 360 so I was unable to view it. I tried to ask for a refund with no response. It is the European format. They need to state it better when it is like that.
030758836X|1.0|I looked forward to reading \\"Gone Girl,\\" for I have several friends who thought it was amazing and could not put it down. I got only 1/3 of the way through the book when I stopped reading. Neither one of the main characters was at all worth caring about. I do not understand why it is still on the top ten reading list in the Times. Dreadful. I am so glad that it was leant to me and I did not buy it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A great match two game with smooth and flawless 3D graphics.<br />The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have smaller puzzles.<br />I whittled away on the first cube for 13 minutes.<br />Still, a fine game - Mahjong, move over ...
B0058YPGSY|5.0|There's not much to say except it has the complete season four on disc. I did like how it was cheaper than Seasons 1-3 though.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Funny, funny, funny!  Great singing as well.  This movie had a little bit of everything, conflict, drama but most of all comedy.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I usually do not like English shows But I LOVE this..  Now I see and understand what everyone was talking about.  Great characters, history involved and life during this time.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|The DVDS are okay, there is only one problem: I'm from Argentina and I wanted to play it on my PlayStation 3 and it didn't work. It said something like &#34;the code is invalid&#34; or something like that<br />Any idea why was that?
B009X01FJS|5.0|This is the 3rd cover I've tried & this is the best.  I love that I can rotate it so the kindle can be charged in the case.

1250000971|5.0|Second book of the Clifton Chronicals, which I read first after getting hooked on it waiting for a prescription at a drug store. Even though it was a continuation, it was well rehearsed and caught my attention immediately. Afterwards I bought the first book and enjoyed it even more. I look forward to the third book in the series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the game has really great graphics! but it takes a while to collect enough coins/diamonds for anything and you cant train your horse. but other than that I like this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its easy and enjoyable. My five year old plays it alot.doesnt need internet connection to play...get coins and do upgrades
0375805613|5.0|This book was my children's favorite when they were growing up.  It is so much fun to read and they want to hear it over and over!
B0042MEQVG|5.0|The third installment of Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster vampire series is its most action packed, both in terms of fight scenes and human-vampire-werewolf lovin'.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again.  I probably watched it 30 times.  Its a delightful movie filled with suspense and lots of action.  One of those movies you can just sit down and enjoy and not feel frustrated or uptight at the end.  Its one of my favorites, you might like it too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book was written with such taste that your not ashamed to read it or share it with my mother
B000I9W08I|5.0|This movie is wonderful. Barbra Streisand is so good in it, Louie Armstrong is great to see in his role.
B004G600A4|5.0|One of my favorite movie, I absalutely loving it.  I recommend you buy it for you and your family.  Best Disney animated movie ever.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|V :^) the first time I am not going to get a great day and the first place in common form of humor and I have a great day and now I had to be a little more than the most important that show breasts are you going through the most
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, I just finished the trilogy, now what! I'm so sad its over! Please get the screenplay done so the movie can be made!
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|I think I've watched this movie about 25 times.  Its a very pleasant movie filled with action and suspense.  Something that you can enjoy without feeling frustrated at the end.  I like it, I think you will too.
B005LAII80|5.0|Untrivialized adaptation of a 30 year old character just doing his job. Can't stop watching this excellent movie.  Action movie of the year, and one of my favorite movies from the past 15 years.
B00005S6K8|5.0|The originial is great. But, this is a winner of a remake. And, that doesn't always happen. Harrison Ford is perfect in his role.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Another of my favorites.  Easy to watch and be swept up in the nostalgia of how popular this movie will always be.  Good times with Bogart.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The movie is great. I've always been a fan of the Bond films and always found the nifty gadgets one of the best parts of the film, but they are lacking in all 3 Daniel Craig movies, which, surprisingly, I don't miss at all.<br /><br />I am leaving this feedback mainly to help others who want to know about the digital format. I contacted Amazon before ordering the disc and was told that I should contact MGM Studios. Really? Contact MGM studios, what kind of answer is that? But I'm ranting now, back on topic, I have purchased a couple Blu-rays and DVDs from Amazon and have been disappointed a few times when the &#34;Digital Copy&#34; turned out to be a UltraViolet (UV) format instead of an iTunes version. I know I can access the UV format from the cloud and watch on multiple devices but it has always been significantly more cumbersome. The format for this film is an additional disc that you insert (with iTunes already open) and then enter a code and download. It also comes with instructions on how to download the UV version if that is your preference.<br /><br /> I found Amazon's customer support to be poor this time around, and will probably look elsewhere for my digital media if they continue to be so secretive in regards to the format of the digital copy. The digital copy was actually supported by Fox Media production, not MGM!

1609611543|4.0|I bought this book after hearing about it on NPR. I'm glad I bought it. There is information in it that helped me to realize that I have a wheat intolerance! I stopped eating gluten-containing products for one week and found that the pain in my arms and hands that doctors were flumoxed to diagnose suddenly dissipated.<br /><br />Mr. Davis's suggestion that you shoud give up all carbs is a bit over the top, however. Not a healthy route for anyone in my opinion, especially an athlete like myself.<br /><br />The book is definitely worth reading. Also thought-provoking.
B006ZVCQNM|5.0|FINALLY, the DEFINITIVE Dio albums/Cd's have been given the 21st-Century upgrade they so rightfully deserve!!  ABOUT TIME!!  LOVE the chiming keyboards on the title track!!  &#34;We Rock&#34;, &#34;One Night In The City&#34;, &#34;Evil Eyes&#34;, and &#34;Egypt(The Chains Are On) are also CERTIFIED classics!!!

B0085KGHI6|5.0|Wow - the music, the collaboration - the times remembered - a priceless set of musical experiences that can be shared again.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I almost didn't go to school because I wanted to finish the game! I recommend this game for everyone! its a good new addiction!
078681859X|5.0|Mr. Stroud is definitely a remarkable writer. He is an exceptional wordsmith and displays a broad knowledge of human character. I have reread this story many times and have managed to enjoy it anew each time!<br /><br />The verbiage and wit may be a bit too esoteric for youth of elementary school age. I see it as appealing to middle-school to octogenarian!
0345803485|1.0|I read it.  Tried to keep an open mind since it was supposed to be such a hit.  But honestly, it's just porn written by a woman.  Seriously, it was trashy and a waste of time for people who truly enjoy GOOD reading.
B005LAII12|5.0|'Ted' isn't for everyone.  Its childish, immature, obnoxious, and probably sort of formulaic, but it works.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />*  Ted seems plausible.  You can really buy into the idea that there is a real, live teddy bear running around raising hell in the world.<br /><br />*  The cast does a really great job of selling the premise of this movie.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />*  Its tough to buy Marky Mark as a 35 year old guy.<br /><br />*  Its also tough to buy Mark W as a 35 year old guy dating Mila Kunis because they really do seem like they are very far apart age-wise...which they are, of course.<br /><br />Other than that, this isn't a movie that strives for high art.  Its a good, fun movie that is tasteless and obnoxious.  Its offensive.  Its racist.  And it takes shots at almost everyone.  For that reason, it is not for everyone, but if you don't mind all of this...you will probably love the movie.

B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I couldn't stop playing this game for days. This is all during my first week of classes too. Recommend buying this game.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Kids, families, even adults with love this. As with any modern animated feature, the adult inuendos and under-tones are clear and prevalent while wholly maintaining the facade of simple kid entertainment. Watch it as a family and the reasons a kid and a parent will chuckle will be different.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|On first hearing the complete CD i thought it would go into my cupboard marked&#34; so-so&#34;  On my second listen it really started to grow on me and now i am right into this album.<br />The first few tunes are typical tight harmony Beachboys and would rate maybe 7/10...not bad but not exceptional.<br />As the Cd gets to the half way mark you can tell the Brian Wilson influence cuts in and the numbers jump to 10/10.<br />Overall....a great CD.....needs a few listens though.
0975991477|4.0|This book was very good although, typical of Bruce Lipton, very technical.  I like his down to earth presentation of scientific topics. This has a lot of good information.
B007REV4YI|5.0|After the last movie, 'Quantam of Solace,' the Bond movies needed to rebound.  Thankfully, 'Skyfall' lives up to the James Bond name and reputation.<br /><br />The action pieces are great.  The opening sequence sets the stage for a really fast paced movie.  Unlike a lot of the other Bond movies, this movie develops the character a bit more, showing Bond when he is down, injured, and vulnerable.  'Skyfall' also shows how deeply the relationship between M and Bond is and the links that both of them will go to protect and defend each other.<br /><br />As with all great Bond movies, the villain is super important.  Javier Bardem has developed quite a niche as the creepy villain in 'Skyfall' and 'No Country For Old Men.'  I don't know what goes on in that guy's head, but he is a fantastic villain.<br /><br />Not to give away any spoilers, but this Bond is a bit more emotional than some of the earlier movies.  In my mind, this is a fitting sequel to the first Daniel Craig Bond movie and one that really holds up to the expectation of what a James Bond movie should be.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Exciting story. Power is an addiction. This is a story about abusing power and trust. People make mistakes, are lied to and others use everyone for their own benefit. The characters are a reflection of our time. Scary!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Its just a very easy version of Super Mario. It is a little fun, but there really is no challenge to the game.
B003ES61EE|5.0|This is a must have item for your camera.  I also take it hunting to clean my rifle scope.  It is great for cleaning out dirt with the brush, and the cleaner tip works great for cleaning off oily smudges or water spots.
B000002KXV|5.0|It has all been said before about this album/CD and i dont think i can add anything of value however it is one of those rare CD's that EVERY song is simply an absolute gem. What more can i say ?
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|A very enjoyable and exciting experience, The second best Bond after Sean Connery. Tell all your friends to check it out.
B001XUT6AG|4.0|Good humor abound and a good story line for the last movie with the original crew.<br />Acting is great by all.  Standouts are Shatner, Kelley, Plummer and Doohan...
B0063IH60K|4.0|just good fun when your tired but not quit tired enough. And it doesn't bother my eyes like some games do

0802798225|5.0|I usually don't reread books but I absolutely love this series and this book! Its a classic Romeo and Juliet style book. The forbidden love. Thanks for writing it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I know now why this book has been on the best sellers list for so long. Very different but very good. I was a bit disappointed with the ending, but I still liked the book.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|wife wanted to see it in the movies wasnt gonna spend over $50 plus snacks and drinks I'm glad i pre-ordered it spent less than $20 movie was Okay
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Its whatever. I only got it just because I felt like it was necessary to have it. Angry birds has exceeded their welcome in the world. Honestly, everything Angry Birds has gotten out of hand.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I previously bought one of the Chinese electronic timer shutter releases. The connector fell apart after two weeks. This Nikon unit is more basic, but way better build quality.
0738711500|5.0|If your just beginning this is a great set. Totally complete and easy to follow. You will not be disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot!  This romance story took some unexpected twists and turns which made it hard to put down.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|What a fascinating story!!! gives the reader a real insight into how Hollywood can shape someone - for godd and for bad.

B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I haven't used this app too much, but when I have used it, it hasn't failed me yet. Good app.
B005LAIIA8|3.0|As all the Disney 3D blu-ray, i was expecting that the slipcover would be with a lenticular presentation, but this one doesn't have it, and the case isn't the best one either, like other Disney blu-rays for a 4 disc edition.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic series - don't miss a single episode.  As usual, the Brits have it.  Brendan Coyle is really getting his chance at last!
B0058VW36U|5.0|i liked playing cut the rope becuse its fun and difference form any game i ever played  it is good
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This book was very good! It was a different kind of good, though. I didn't want to read chapter after chapter until the end, but in all, this book is great! It's a little bit wordy, and hard to read at times, but that's only because of how the speech was during that time period. I definitely recommend this book!
B008EKOO46|5.0|This is the the real ancestry.com, the history that made you you. It tells you what humans were as the human mind was was being built, and what you are on the inside. Diamond is an engaging story teller and an unpretentious intellectual giant. He tell us why we are violent, why we are fat, and why we love.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|At first I only thought of this app as a notepad, but it has so many other uses. Overall, an amazing app.
B00005B4GT|5.0|radiohead continues their doomed kaleidoscope of sounds that they started at the turn of the century with more emphasis on conventional songwriting.
B005USZYDU|3.0|Not a bad book if you compare it to The Hardy Boys. I wish I had known before I plunked down $7.99.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i enjoy playing lt very much i play it every day lt is very diffence form any gamei plaved before
B00633W614|5.0|This is the 2nd of the Clifton Chronicles.  As with the first, I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read the third!
B009EEFTMC|2.0|I love playing this game but will stop at finishing one cube. I absolutely cannot take the music and there is no option to turn it off. I will wait for that option to be provided, if that happens.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|Not too good. I much prefer Office Suite Pro after a few tests.Here are a few of the problems I encountered:<br />Word - almost impossible to format text in a document. No justification. Font control is a challenge.<br />Excel - no embedded plots at all, even to display.<br />Power point - no slideshow mode. No preview pane. Swipe is the only action recognized<br /><br />Pluses - Google docs access works well. Editing a simple text file is just fine.<br /><br />Overall - needs work..<br /><br />UPDATE - I upgraded my rating from one to three stars. Turns out that on some Powerpoint presentations Office Suite Pro does not get the font sizes correct, and this can sometimes be a problem. The \\"Slideshow To Go\\" App gets it right. Not fancy, but in this case it does a better job.
0375850864|5.0|When You Reach Me is a wonderful book.  Written with sensitivity about the friendships, jealousies, pettiness, and kindness in the relationships among sixth grade girls and boys, it is also a fascinating and suspenseful sci-fi tale.  I was so surprised by the twists and turns of the plot, I had to read it again immediately after I finished it, and it has withstood a couple more readings since.  I read it aloud to my 11-year-old son, who loved it as much as I did.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Waiting to find out who would fill the vacancy was not something I cared about or identified with even though I love politics. I enjoy stories of people living in small towns but this one did not interest me.It was colorless.  I stuck with it to the end but it was<br />a bit of a chore.
B00A757EFW|3.0|is a good game but its to fast for me every time i play it i get no were fast
1250027624|5.0|Love it!! Love Downton Abbey! If you are a fan, you will enjoy this book. Price was right, too. Very well done.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved every word of it. This is what it would be like if I went to mars and got trapped there. Mark is literally my personality. Such a great book. A must read!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|What can I say? I'm a geeky video gamer, fan of anime, and was a kid in the 1980s. This book brought back memories. It was well written and fast paced. A very good read.
B000F3T3CS|3.0|There are numerous reviews of this production, and crowning it, the Grammophone even named this the 'best on DVD'.<br />Well, on Youtube, there exists this Otto Schenk production at Vienna State Opera performed in 1989, reocrded by ORF, but present 'not' commercially available, with Adina by Alida Ferrarini, Nemorino by Francisco Araiza and Dulcamara by Rolando Panerai, Belfiore by Alberto Rinaldi.<br />THAT cast, I report, is artistically superior to THIS 21st century cast, if not visually.<br />Not only is the singing superior - Ferrarini's Donizettian style simply blows Netrebko to the dust, Araiza's vocalism Villazon simply no match, Panerai a much more seasoned singer than D'Arcangelo, Rinaldi much younger than Nucci here and more convincing as a suitor of Adina, but that the cast THERE actually acted better than this 21st century star-studded cast!<br />Ferrarini's Adina in particular is worthy of mention.  This underrated soprano is indeed Adina incarnate in her demeanour and vocal acting. Even if less attractive than Netrebko (who is, any way?), her minx-like manners and sweet looks cut a wonderfully pert and lively figure, and her singing, really, is a real force of nature!  The voice is focused and agile, with utter capability to shade every nuance, and with spitfire coloraturas to boot.  The perfect Adina, simply put.<br />Francisco Araiza is no longer young in that 1989 performance, but his Nemorino is not only vocally outstanding, but also musically outstanding.  He acts with utter elan and innocence of a young peasant.  If Pavarotti fails to convince visually as a young and boyish Nemorino, Araiza manages to do so.  While Villazon has both the voice and looks for the role, his vocalism is no match for either Pavarotti or Araiza.<br />What remains is, of course, for THAT 1989 immaculate recording to be released commercially!
0843189673|5.0|I read these books to my daughter a couple decades ago and we shared a lot of laughter with them even while learning subtle lessons about kindness, happiness, sharing, neatness etc. I purchased these for my niece that's four and a half; hopefully she and her parents will love them as much as we did.
B005HSL626|5.0|jf is my favorit  game i play it all the time it has  it is a game you can pjav alone

B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Gives badge type play and loads fairly quickly...overall an enjoyable game. Not sure why after each game it shuffles the cards forever but at least you can just hit the new game button.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best even children love it. the monster is not scary at all I love this game a lot
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Gave as a gift. Well received, and appreciated. Said it was accurate and interesting. Learned from it. Priced right as well.
0062082353|5.0|This book is a true writing by a true solder. The ability of this writer to tell it like it is a very valuable tool for all family's needing to understand what their soldiers go through when deployed in harm's way. It also shared the family's feelings as well, a true all around piece that give's both feeling's of it's participants. Chris Kyle was a true family man, and American soldier who gave all for his country so that we may have freedom. &#34;RIP&#34;
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my sister and brother in law and they both loved it, Look forward to watching it again.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book was well written and held my attention all the way through. I would recommend The Martian to any one who likes good Science fiction.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|It is how I remembered it when I first saw it so many years ago. It has stuck with me then and will probably not be watched for another 20 years. Very graphic
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Happy valentines everyone!!!!!<br />Subway suffers is totaly fun but addictive!<br />This game is good for I would say about 7 year old kids and up.<br />recommend getting this app from amazon instead of the play store or some other place.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Bingo blitz<br />if you play more than one card at a time you miss half of the numbers<br />it moves a little too fast
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent writing. One of those rare books you don't want to end. Just read it. You will be glad you did, and find yourself writing a review just as fawning as this one.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have this game for both my kindle and my I phone I love it wish some<br />parts were a little easier it complete

B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Kinda creepy for children preschool age.  will look for a hard copy DVD to share with the youngins later. Thanks
1451695195|4.0|This book is certainly worth reading.  The author tells an intriguing story with the beginning and ending especially gripping. The medical terminology and descriptions are a little deep for the average layman.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|I ordered this CD because years ago our oldest son had a record that he played.  There was one song  I especially liked:  Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I am 64.  I love that song.  When I searched the attic for the record, it was gone.  So you see I ordered the CD for the one song.  I have played the CD three times since receiving it yesterday.  It was great being able to get it.  Some of the other songs are nice, too.<br /><br />My husband and I lived together almost 63 years, so needing and feeding until 64 seems awfully young!!

1401227821|5.0|This is one of the best Art books I have purchased in years. It gives me motivation to become a great artist just like Adam Hughes!
B000BYCAJE|5.0|excellent choice for anyone interested in mid-70s country rock with an English twist courtesy of Mr Nash.  Buy it and keep it close!
1451695195|1.0|This book is interesting in its way, yet there are a few troubling references that don't seem to align with the Scriptures.  First, the author uses this quote in describing &#34;Om&#34; or the &#34;Core&#34; (God):  &#34;a deep but dazzling darkness&#34;.  First John 1:5 assures us, &#34;...God is light, and there is no darkness in Him at all.&#34;<br /><br />Secondly, Dr. Alexander says evil is &#34;necessary, because without it free will was impossible&#34;.  Evil is NOT necessary, and not a creation of a loving God.  Hebrews 5:14 tells us evil is contrary to divine and human law.<br /><br />Third, the author writes much about psychics, mediums, and clairvoyance.  Numerous Scriptures warn of these including Leviticus 19:31, &#34;Do not rely on mediums and psychics, for you will be defiled by them.  I the Lord am your God.&#34;  (See also<br />Leviticus 20:27 and 2 Chronicles 33:6)<br /><br />I did not begin this book with the intention of scrutinizing it.  I was looking forward to reading about Dr. Alexander's experience.  Yet, as a Christian, I would not recommend this work to others due to its lack of Scriptural integrity and its overtly &#34;New Age&#34; tone.
159420411X|4.0|Finally, a statistics oriented book that raised my reading interest. Uses real world issues to highlight the value of Bayesian thinking in predictions. Raised my curiosity to understand Bayes rule and its application.
B003XU7VY2|5.0|I read the book on recommendation from my brother.  Recently I listened to the audio book while quilting.  I enjoyed it even more and wanted the audio for my own.  Now I can listen anytime.  Thanks so much  Title:  Have a Little Faith
B00006CXSS|5.0|Greatest World War 2 movie EVER! I have watched this movie at least million times since it was released in 2001.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found the story to be a true testimonial of the not only the raid that killed Bin Laden, but also a glimpse into the life of a SEAL, both professional and personal.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|It was delivered very quick and great quality on the movie!!!! My duaghter loves this movie and is very excited to have it! Thank you!!
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|This was a solid movie, I would definitely recommend seeing it.  This was not one of those movies you are glad that you did not pay to see it in the theater.  It is a must see.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey (Season 3) does NOT disappoint, just like Seasons 1 and 2.  I can talk about Thomas, Mr. Bates, the cook, the prostitute, Mary, Grandmama, and all of them...but I won't.  Downton Abbey will draw you in and make you yearn for the next episode!  Better than ER, The Office, and 60 minutes!
0793518326|1.0|Upon receipt, I was thrilled to have this book.  However, I've just begun an arranging project based on some of the Beatles' music and as I looked to this tome for help, I was aghast at how many mistakes there were.  So, far I've gone through 5 tunes, \\"Back In The USSR,\\" \\"Martha, My Dear,\\" \\"Because,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" and \\"Lady Madonna\\" and have found so many egregious errors that it's really not worth using this book anymore, as I'll be afraid to trust anything in it.  For those who have commented that there are a few minor errors here and there, here are a couple examples:<br /><br />Both piano intros for Lady Madonna and Martha, My Dear are not even close.  Off by more than just a few notes.  Intricacies I can understand, but to not have the music in the correct octave and wrong chords all over the place?  Totally unacceptable.<br /><br />Back In The USSR - wrong chords throughout, expecially in the bridge (my God, this is basic rock 'n' roll, how can you not hear these chords!!), missing background vocals<br /><br />Because - incorrect harmonies throughout the transcription.<br /><br />I've come to the realization that in order to finish my project, my best bet is to close this book forever as it can't be trusted.<br /><br />Such a shame; this could have been a great book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not your typical YA love story... Not. At. All. A story about unconditional love, coping, healing, survival, and Hope. I was completely blown away by the way this story plays out.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is okay they shill put puzzles in if they make a 3rd game. This is what they can get more people to play
B00932ANQM|1.0|Amazon needs to include a vomit bag as well as a split screen with a better movie playing side by side.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is wonderful and very responsible for taking care of a horse that seems real. Overall this is a great game.
0307592731|5.0|One of the most inspiring, moving, well written books I've read in a long time.  Strayed weaves the story of her experience on the trail with the story of her life before the hike and the events that got her to that point in a fluid, engaging way.  Highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Book one was good.  Book two redundant.  Book three tedious.  Stop reading at book one and you will enjoy the experience much more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love thid game it is so very fun to play on it is my favorite game yet so fun
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This is a great movie, and amazon's playback of the movie is top notch.  There were no glitches in the playback.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My  teacher recomended it to me and I loved it. This book includes romance, fighting, and taking controll of one another. The author writes a little weird, though.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|I choose this because I wanted a good collection of their earlier stuff.  They sound great!  The DVD-A is outright astounding when played on the high-end system in my car, an Acura.  Hearing Fly by Night at that quality level is just an amazing experience.  I wish the whole thing had the start discs along with the DVD-A.  Anybody that like Rush should get this.  This is also a great primer for anybody getting into Rush.  Although this collection is their earlier, less commercial stuff so this may not be for the novice Rush fans.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I have been a fan for over 10 years of Josh Groban. In last couple of years his songs selections on his Cds have not been as strong as his earlier efforts. Josh has been writting a lot of material with others. And I am very sorry to say I think that has been his reason why his material has not been at as good as his earlier efforts.<br /><br />This newest CD to me is his least strongest effort in song writting to date and his vocals really seem to me lacking. They do not show his true vocal talents at all. There is not one song that did anything for me. Sometimes artists do need to grow and change however this type of material does not do it for me at all.<br /><br />Leave the song writting to the pros Josh, and get back to cross over type of material Josh and you will win me back. There is plenty of material you can sing and sing very well too! If he does change this,this will be the last purchase of his music by me, Sorry to say but true!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This Dvd: Pitch Perfect was shipped in good condition. This DVD is brand new. Fast shipping (Did not take that long for this item to be shipped). There was nothing I disliked about this product/ no complaints. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend or someone I know. I really liked this movie and wanted to buy this item. I am glad I purchased this item. Overall, the product did meet my expectation.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Pretty fun game, just wish it had more levels before it had you buy the game.  Would recommend just for fun
B005FITIIC|4.0|Well acted, and it doesn't surprise me that director JC Chandor made his living directing commercials; the blue/green transfer look is pernicious.<br /><br />But it's impossible to feel any sympathy for any of the characters: to the last, they get away scot-free and rich, with green pastures ahead. The thought it left me with was this: nobody went to jail over the 2008 financial crisis.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Was a good movie! Wasn't quite what i expected but it was ok. I wished it would of went further into detail in the end.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I first got this book on Monday. Finished Thursday. I couldn't believe the depth to each of the book's characters.
B00AKOB7CG|1.0|Never could get this app open. Was hung up from the beginning. Too bad:( Hope the creator can get the bugs out.
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|I'm not fluent in Spanish yet, but this was very easy to read with its clearly written and intriguing articles. From the introduction: \\"...estas 35 historias de ayer son historias de hoy. Y lo serán de mañana.\\"
B0091ICDHU|5.0|I cried and laughed at the same time reading this book. It is such a moving story that it's impossible not to be affected and do some self reflections.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin dozer is a fun and addictive game but it takes forever to build up more coins. u have to be patient
B00005JM20|3.0|We got what we ordered and have enjoyed it.  We could tell the signs of it being used and I think it took a little longer to receive it than what I expected.
B0054VVRBQ|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because it's a little bit kludgy and probably doesn't suport Mountain Lion.  Otherwise, it works great!<br /><br />1. Download the Mac Driver from the Transcend website - hit: &#34;Accessories&#34; category, it's the RDF1.<br />2. Install this driver before you ever insert it into your Mac.  YOU WILL GET AN ERROR DURING INSTALL!  This freaked me out, and I didn't realize it was actually still (slowly) installing.  I force quit it, ran the driver remover on it, tried again, and it worked (and rebooted).<br />3. Insert the (empty) Express card.  This is REALLY, REALLY hard - like preparing a cross bow!  And it's really recessed into the slot.  I had no doubts that if I let it pop out, it could probably shoot through half inch plywood.  But it's in SOLID now.<br />4. Insert the SDHC card -&#62; this is also very hard - you have to press hard, and it's in deep.  Probably a great solution if you want to use an SDHC card as a permanent extra flash drive.<br /><br />THE GOOD NEWS:  At least in SL, it works fine.  No issues whatsoever.  And it's much faster than my USB 2.0 adapters.<br />If Transcend gets it working in Mountain Lion, I'll up it to 5 stars, because then I won't have to buy a different card when I upgrade.  But for this price, it's fine.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|If you like Mahjong, you will fill right at home here. However, the presentation of the game on a 3D cube gives it enough of a twist that it is something new. The basic rules are the same as Mahjong, but the twist is that instead of new tiles just showing up under the old ones, you can now rotate the playing field to get just the right angle into the 3D cube.<br /><br />The game execution is very smooth and easy to use. Rotate the cube by dragging, make matches by clicking. There was not any lag or jumpiness on my Galaxy S3.<br /><br />There are a couple of weaknesses outside of the core gameplay:<br />The options screen is not available until you start playing the game. I like to turn off the sound right away, and was afraid I wouldn't be able to at all at first (but you can in the game).<br />You can't quit the game and resume later -- if you have to stop for a while, you'll need to start over.<br />No difficulty/size configuration. If I've only got 5 minutes to play, and I can't resume, it'd be nice to do a really small puzzle.<br />Annoying promotional screen on exiting. Luckily they let you disable this in the options screen.<br /><br />Conclusion: This game is a new twist on an old game, and the core execution of the game is great. It could use some improvements in menus and options provided.<br /><br />Permissions: Network access, presumably for the leaderboard. Meh.
B0058A119G|5.0|Great album to add to  your collection if you re a Streisand fan. You can't miss with the Bergman lyrics and music. Bonus cd is also  nice addition to any collection.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This is an exceptional book. This book is both for children as well as adults. Very heart felt. I recommend you read it to your kids. My two girls love it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love the fact that I can listen to the music that I love and be able to bring it with me any where I go., This is great and I love it~~~
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This arm works great and is holding my 24 inch monitor without trouble. Packaging states that it has a maximum load of 18 lbs and my monitor is only 12.5 lbs, so be sure to check your monitor weight before you order if your larger than the 22 inch size limit it mentions.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Great film from start to finish, good plot line with a few twists. I enjoyed watching Bradley Cooper kill it.
1451695195|3.0|The book is well written but I expected more detail on his time spent in Heaven. I am a Christian and definitely believe in heaven but I have read more descriptive books written by people who have experienced out of body experiences.
0887081770|1.0|My son loves the moon and looks for it any time he is outside. So his dad bought him a moon nightlight that goes through the phases for his room for his 2nd birthday. He LOVES books and I love Eric Carle so when I saw this I was VERY excited; it would go perfectly with his moon nightlight.  When it got here I was so disappointed because it's TINY. Like I can fit it in my back pocket tiny. And the unfolding of the pages isn't exactly ideal for a 2 year old. I should have read the negative reviews before making my purchase. I also assumed since it was \\"hardcover\\" that it would have been a full size book. Still a neat book. But I really feel gypped on my purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've never seen the movie yet but after reading this I'm going to just too see how close they get
B004RKXW0E|5.0|If your a fan of Disney movies and especially Pixar, Toy Story 3 is a must have! Great story for both kids and adults and teaches good morals as well!
B006LSZECO|2.0|i enjoyed the first 90 percent of the book. the end was just stupid. it was thrown togetherand didnt even make sense. im surprised her publisher let her get away with it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is the most innovative game I've come across so far. It isn't overly complicated yet provides a challenge to the player at the same time. I am not sure why others would not give it five stars unless it isn't compatible with their device. Free is always best but if free doesn't have anything new this is definitely worth the $1.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This is my favorite Nicholas Cage movie. I remember watching this movie when I was younger thinking how great of a movie it is. It is a fast paced action movie that has a lot of beautiful cars in it. Nicholas's brother in the movie gets caught up in the lifestyle Cage was in. Cage left and his brother took up the car boosting business. Cage's brother got into some trouble and Cage had to come back to help save his brother. I really feel that this movie was very good, and well worth the money to own it. I have watched it over a dozen times and still love it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|enjoying passing the time with this one. I like it better then regular solitaire. change of pace, very easy to play
B00881VLCE|4.0|Good fun for all<br />Take it even everywhere, love the puzzles.<br />Great for the entire family and we take turns.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Still Makes me laugh. When Val Kilmer was thin.  Made quite a while ago, but still has that Airplane humor that I love.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is a great puzzle app! It is very addicting, and it has all the qualities of a great app. The graphics are beautifully done, the sound clips are very good, and the interface is top notch. Great job Developers!
B0069UP2PI|3.0|that so many great actresses were the first responders to the epidemic; smart, capable, highly educated and trained women characters - lovely.  The soundtrack didn't totally suck, which was nice.  Disliked the opportunistic Jude Law character, but probably most people did.  Most of the acting was good.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The book was very slow and boring. It seemed like it was just being dragged on. Not a book worth reading. It would just be a waste of time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is awesome, you see results quickly and it's not boring. Because of her 3, 2, 1 method, it keeps it interesting. I get bored when doing repetitive cardio, like jogging or being on the elliptical for 20 minutes, I feel like 20 minutes turns into 5 hours, then after that, sometimes I really don't feel it or see results fast!  This 20 minute workout really pushes you and it goes by  fast because of her method, which I love, and you will feel the \\"burn\\" in your muscles!  After the first day of doing this DVD, next day at work, I already had girls say, you look different. Everyone is different, but after 30 days, I lost weight, inches, feel great, and my endurance it a lot higher. I wish all workouts were this quick and effective!<br /><br />(If you also incorporate eating healthy (or at least make better choices), drinking lots of water,  you will see more results!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I got this app for free which always great, but this app is very good. I am always happy when amazon offers a great app for free. This game has a lot of unique features. It has two different game modes which are puzzle mode and cube attack mode. Both modes of playing are very fun and unique. It is a good time killer when you want to do a quick puzzle. I would recommend this game (especially today as its free from amazon). Graphics are pretty decent, game play is addicting, and overall this is a pretty good game.<br /><br />Permissions are not invasive: Network communication (full network access)
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|a young man kills for a living, without apparently any problem with it, gets high, dresses well, parties with his friends, drives a nice car, and sleeps with his favorite prostitute.  Later, because it's a time travel science fiction film, he meets an older version of himself (Bruce Willis), who figures out he must kill 3 kids, and this may perhaps save his future, beloved wife.  Most of the film is death, destruction and unpleasantness, with a few minutes of redemption at the end.  Unappealing story unsympathetically told, though the actors are good.  If the filmmaker was determined to show the work habits and lifestyle of an unrepentant assassin, I'd have preferred he'd shown the assassin's origin story, which may have at least allowed the audience to generate some sympathy for the lead character, if say, for example, he'd been forced by circumstance and lack of other options into his career choice.  As presented though, I don't understand what value the writer thought this story would have for his audience - it's not entertaining to see a male character kill over and over and over again, bound, gagged, kneeling victims which the assassin murders and whose remains he discards unceremoniously in a furnace.  I read that critics said the assassin fell in love with the Emily Blunt character, but I saw no sign of that - I saw a sex scene between them, not love.  The assassin seemed to sympathize with the rainmaker child, because the assassin himself was abandoned by his mother, and he and the child had a conversation - if anything there was a connection between the assassin and the rainmaker, but the child was written so creepily, it diluted the audience's ability to care for him, except of course we don't want a child murdered.  So, basically, no place to connect to the story emotionally for the audience; the assassin was presented doing his job, in the first 10 minutes or so we see him murder maybe 8 people, can't connect to a character like that; Emily Blunt's character enters the story in an unappealing manner - the only glimmers of positive feeling I saw the characters share were between the Bruce Willis character and his wife, and the Emily Blunt character and her devil spawn son; these glimmers were brief though, and not enough to attach an audience, i.e., to help an audience get emotionally involved in the story.  And if a storyteller is not trying to get his audience to care, why tell the story.<br /><br />Additional thoughts - I suspect the writer had an idea of his story being a learning curve for his lead, who experiences an epiphany at the story's end and is able to compare, by how destructively he's led his own life, and how other characters tell him the rainmaker as an adult brings death/destruction on others, that the lead needs to kill himself (which will stop his older self, Bruce Willis, from killing the rainmaker's mother), and that this sacrifice might stop the future violence of the rainmaker - that perhaps the only way the rainmaker will not become a monster, will be to allow him his mother's care and guidance during his childhood.  The problem for the audience is this realization comes to the lead at the story's end, long after he has been established in the story as a cold blooded killer of many, including the murder of an innocent child his Bruce Willis self erroneously suspects as being the rainmaker child.  The lead is totally unsympathetic to the audience by the time he makes his sacrifice, so the value of the sacrifice is almost entirely lost on us.  The writer needed to have his lead do something positive long before his sacrifice, before he met the rainmaker child, to help the audience see him as something other than an assassin, which, after all, the writer establishes his lead as being.  A story is a proof, an argument - the writer wants to change a villan into a hero over the course of his story; he successfully introduces his lead as a villan (unrepentant assassin), but fails in transitioning him into a hero within the story in a believable way.  A single heroic act at the story's end doesn't make the lead a hero, it just confuses the audience to see a character who has been previously established as a villan, out of the blue, perform a heroic act.  If the writer wants his lead to be a hero, he needs to write situations in the story which allows the audience to witness the lead's path to heroism.  Basically, the writer didn't give enough evidence (information) of the lead's heroism over the course of the story.  In his next effort, I hope the writer will do better - he nailed the villan part, giving plenty of evidence, and I see where he wanted to go; he just left out two or three situations where a good guy vibe for his lead was required, and the audience needed to witness those scenes before the lead met the rainmaker and the rainmaker's mother.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I liked this dvd as I like most of Sandra Bullocks dvd. It was a good family dvd.Passed it on to family.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I have a rule about buying blu-rays...I do my best to never buy something I won't want to see again, even years from now.  Go ahead, this one is awesome.
B00A8LYYI0|4.0|I will say i was impressed that this movie is as good as it is. I was nervous about the first once since I played the video game because I thought they couldn't represent it well enough or the movie would flop. I was wrong the first one was a very good movie. This one is pretty good as well. It is suspenseful and follows the plot of silent hill 3 if you have played the game.<br /><br />The story was interesting and the action was very suspenseful. The acting of the movie was good as well. (There is nothing like a horror movie with poor acting aka a comedy then) As far as the horror aspect of this movie it does get scary at times but in my opnion its mostly due to the graphic scenes. They really did a great job with the special FXs.<br /><br />This movie is well worth a watch if you enjoyed the games or enjoyed the previous movie. It does have some gory scenes which can be disturbing, but not ridiculous like some new movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love the this game. I cant stress enough that it needs caves. I get bored just strip mining. But overall I love this game.
B000YAA68C|4.0|Liked this dvd. Watched it awhile ago so don't remember the plot. Would probably be liked for most family members.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was a great dvd as it was based on a true story. I enjoyed it as well as other family members enjoyed it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the characters and this story.  I absolutely love this author and all his work and this one is no different. If you are a Nicolas sparks fan them this is a must read.
B00846REIS|4.0|I thought the book was very close to the Fifty series but has it own screwed up characters.  I found it interesting and very good.
B007N579X6|5.0|This is a cute family movie with a nice message but the 3d is spectacular at the end. His minions come right out the screen at you. Very cool!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This may be a small film, but it's a great film nonetheless.  Hunt and Hawkes are nothing short of extraordinary.
006056251X|4.0|Love Sebastian witty words. The ultimate rake. Liked how the girl Evie was smart even though she was extremely shy because of her shuddering.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best soap opera I have watched in a long time.  I usually avoid them however this one is exceptional and holds my attention.
B005KR6OBM|4.0|Heard great things about the show, but I didn't have TV at the time. Friends who<br />watched it claimed they watched it to understand my sort haha. I bought seasons 1-4 for<br />my 29th birthday and couldn't stop laughing. The characters are just honestly some<br />of those I've known in the real world as it's known. Bought season five as well...now to wait<br />to get season six...damn you long wait!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Entertaining and straight forward version of classic Mahjong game.  I enjoy passing time with this  app.  It's been years since I've seen a good version.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is really not about the zombie's walking about trying to feast on your flesh. It is far more about the problems challenges and struggles that arise once mankind as we know it breaks down. It keeps your attention makes you care about the characters and leaves you wanting more once the credits starts rolling. There really are not too many shows out there that do that for me.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Good characters, actors made the scenes believable and I thoroughly enjoyed the good and bad in each of the characters.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it I like it a lot better then temple run<br />It was really cool I love the minecraft and zipline
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The second book could be in the first book - I guess the author just wanted to make more money by writing 3 books ! I got curious at the end of the first book about how the story would go so I decided to read book number 2. The end of book number 2 was not good enough to lead me to buy #3.<br /><br />And the repetition of the sex scenes ... over and over and over.<br /><br />I gave 2 stars instead of 1 star just because the book is good if you want to go &#34;brain dead&#34; for awhile.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I would give this zero stars if I could. I have only had it several months and it has already broken beyond repair. I called LIFEPROOF because they have a warranty on their products and are more than happy to replace them. After giving them my serial number on my case and telling them who the seller was they informed me that they are NOT an authorized seller and that my case is a fake and I needed to contact ZM for a refund. I have emailed them tonight and we will see how they handle it. Save your money because when this POS case breaks you are just out of luck.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|At first I didn't think I would care for it much, but it really is an interesting game.  Gave the 5 stars for excellence in touch sensitivity.  Something that small on a phone you would think you might have problems with touching the right blocks, but I had no problem at all.  Nice job.
B0094K1K42|3.0|I think she was rather obnoxious but I watched to the end to see what happened to her!  My 2 cents.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't understand why all the media fuss about this book - Ok - there is some hot stuff, good to read relaxing on the beach, when you want to go brain dead. But the characters are very unreal.<br /><br />The sex &#34;scenes&#34; keep being repeated over and over and over.
B00478TRQ4|5.0|As a Clinical Psychologist, I rarely see good examples of therapy on TV. The show &#34;In Treatment&#34; is a remarkable exception, presenting a flawed but talented person/therapist dealing with a wide variety of problems. It's a shame the show was cancelled.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Was written in a very descriptive way and sometimes I lost the plot while reading the 20 pages of description.  I also realize it was a translated book so maybe that was the problem
0765325950|5.0|The Wheel of Time series is the best book series I have ever read.  When Robert Jordan passed away before completing the final book, I was honestly devastated.  I had been with these characters for so long, I could not believe that they were going to be left incomplete, without having finally fought in the Last Battle.  When Brandon Sanderson came along and took up the reigns to finish the late Jordan's work, I was skeptical at first.  After reading Book 12 and 13, my anticipation, and expectations for the final entry were through the roof.  I am happy to report that AMOL is a very satisfying ending to this 14 book epic.  Be prepared for fantastic suspense, detailed and strategic battles, and indescribable loss as you take the final steps in purchasing and reading the conclusion of the best series of all time, The Wheel of Time.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The perfect blend of fantasy and reality, this show tells all your favorite fairy tales in such a creative way. They keep all the important details, but twist it enough that they all tie together and make sense in our reality. The writers are amazing! The cast truly becomes the fairy tale creatures you always imagined while maintaining a human vulnerability that we can all relate to. Once Upon a Time has something for everyone: action, mystery, romance, suspense, drama, family, hope, and an unfailing belief that good will triumph over evil against all odds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game...definitely recommend this to anyone is all ages. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Ususal tight dialog and detailed characters of MC's writing - thought the end came up a little quickly but this did not detract from the story.<br /><br />And again Connelly has produced a taut story of evil and crime without having to resort to extensive, horrific violence; too many  present day authors seem to be determined to outdo all others with excessive use cruelty, pain and madness.<br /><br />Great to see Michael Connelly books are still writen by  Michael Connelly and not &#34;part sub- contracted&#34; out with other writers.
1592537251|2.0|was a little disappointed in the book, when I read scketching, I automatical though pin and pencil. I'm not interested in sketching with watercolors are other media.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Ordered a used one of this version and it was perfectly fine! i was a little skeptical but it was as good as new! figured i would save the earth by re-using something. No scratches. Saw the movie in theaters but wanted it on DVD. Don't regret it one bit.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I loved Season 1, had to see Season 2!  It was just as good!  I will be purchasing Season 3 sometime soon.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|We have invested wisely since then, but the book makes me realize that although I am an avid clothes shopper at discount stores like TJMax, Target and such, and overshop food from Costco so we could always have food for when the kids come to visit, we, well, I , am harming our potential to accumulate enough of our wealth/security to live on when we are too old to work.<br />Kindle format needs tweaking Table 3-2 is cut off on the right.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty good game my four year old loves it and I sneak and play too its a great time killer
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A relaxing time.........until you get really envolved.  Find myself not being able to put this down!  Would recommend  this highly for a no worry experience!
B005WBBYXO|4.0|This is not a book, it is a trilogy. I decided to buy it after watching the film of \\"The Golden Compass\\", which was based on the firs book of the trilogy. All the story carries more than a bit of fantasy and poetic license, though all in all it is based on currently sound religious, phylosofic and scientific phenomena. I could think of it as a \\"sciento-phylosophic-religious fantasy\\". The author seems to have researched a bit on what he describes throughout the book, and whoever has read books like \\"The Tao of Physics (Ftitijoff Kapra), the Bible or the Tao Te King (Lao Tzu) will be familiar with at least some developments.<br />The only reason I don't give it a 5star rating is beacause the ending seemed somewhat \\"fuzzy\\" to me - it looks like the author is intending to continue the saga.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|all my kids have loved this one.  Truly a classic not to be missed for families with young children.  Glad to have it in our collection
B003O86FMW|5.0|Downloaded to my new kindle after having read the trilogy in print. Although they are considered young adult, I still find them addictive and at a level that adults can enjoy too. Looking forward to the remaining two movies as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute game, takes me back to tamagotchi. I like that it has lots of little games and ways to interact with the horse.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a great read, it really captures the struggles teens may face. It takes you back to high school to your own wallflower days.
0440238609|5.0|I actually read this a couple of years ago. I loved the whole trilogy and will definitely read it again.<br />This one was a present to a 9 year old boy, who loved it.<br />The box is nice and keeps all three books together. I love the look on it. Also each book has a cut-through in the cover (like a little hole) so you can see the nice picture on the first side. It all looks really pretty.<br /><br />Since this one was a present I actually think of getting it for me too, since I don't have an English copy of the trilogy and I really love the details of this box and each book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm a picky reader and was sceptical to get this book, but to my surprise this was a real good one.
B000002J1M|5.0|This is really more of an event than an album.  All the tracks are enjoyable, but the real show-stealer is the final track, Supper's Ready.  Despite an unassuming name, this is one of the greatest compositions of the last half-century.  The piece is a long-form track which subdivides itself into various movements.  The lyrics tell a story which is epic in proportions, but the music is even more significant.  The piece makes great use of theme and variation, consisting in several melodies which recur to various degrees at different points in the piece: a judicious amount of Leitmotiv pervades the work.  The instrumentation is full and has nice tone colour, and the vocals are also full and blended.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a lover of music, and it is a must-hear for prog-rock fans and music theorists alike.

B009NYF2ES|5.0|This is a review of  only the audio and video of the Blu Ray Cabaret, which has had some discussion here.<br /><br />When you first turn on the movie you might \\"score\\" the visuals and audio on an absolute level. That is how well the picture compares to a modern movie filmed today.  In that case Cabaret gets:<br /><br />Video: 3.5 out of a 1-5 absolute rating<br />Audio: 3 out of a 1-5 absolute rating<br /><br />But on a cinematic rating the movie gets:<br />Video: 4.75 out of a 1-5 absolute rating<br />Audio 4.5 out of a 1-5 absolute rating<br /><br />But this is not a musical of the 1950s or 60s. Gone are the bright Technicolor sets and makeup. Gone is the dancing in the streets and the huge invisible orchestra that follows the cast around.<br /><br />Here, the singing and dancing only appear on stage, and with a small orchestra that we see in the club.<br /><br />Many of the scenes take place in the Kit Kat Cabaret, surrounded by artificial lighting. The lighting is harsh, stark, unappealing and the colors seemed a bit drained. When the performers are on screen, they just have one bright very white spotlight on their faces. There is no colored, warm lighting, nor any lighting form above or below.  Ms. Minnelli is pale, almost white throughout the movie and this makes that stand out.  And, when you watch them on the stage, the lighting makes you feel claustrophobic. If you are uncomfortable looking at it this way, it's deliberate. Out of the club, in the \\"poor homes\\" the lighting is still very unnatural and subdued, and a bit harsh. In the rich homes and outdoor scenes there is a richer, less grainy color.<br /><br />Note however, that in Joel Grey's last number, lighting begins to show from the ceiling and the stage is well lit for Ms. Minnelli's Cabaret.<br /><br />This cinematography helps set the stage and the mood of the entire picture.<br /><br />Audio:<br />We are used to full orchestras in musicals, Mary Poppins, West Side Story, etc. They are here not onlyin the production numbers.<br /><br />Here music comes from three places only, there is no real background score:<br />1. The orchestra in the Cabaret. It's a small orchestra and it does not have that great all-consuming sound, it sounds a bit thin. They also, to me, sound a bit tiny.<br />2. Records, vinyl for the 1930s<br />3. Street musicians.<br /><br />In the 1950s and early 1960s the studios worked hard to get the best audio, especially in musicals. That was lost for almost a decade until Star Wars came around. So the fidelity here could have been better.<br /><br />\\"Here, life is beautiful. The girls are beautiful. Even the orchestra is beautiful! \\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such an amazing game. I spend hours on this game. It has me late to work all the time.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I watched this doc for an English class and found it so well done I purchased it.  I found it to be fair, politically unbiased, and very thorough.  Highly recommend it!
B000TPYWGY|5.0|AS A TULL fan of decades. , I have found the band to seem to add an element that suggests to me what a minstrel show of long gone days.<br />  I DETECT A love of true musical talent And a swell of storytelling that was once the real source of keeping the past within our educational experience.<br />  IN KEEPING WIth  the spirit of true reality,It must be said that each and every jethro till album is an experience best enjoyed by itself.in as the true  joys are really encased  in songs that are not always found on other albums.<br />BURSTING OUT. IS MY WAY  OF ENJOYING ANDEXPERINCING THE FINE REMBERANCES OF EXPERENCES GONE BY.for those of you who have seen this band in live concert I need not say more..Juggling What?
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I bought this as a christmas present for my boyfriend and he loved it. The price was great and he was happy, so I was happy with the purchase.
B000MV90B2|5.0|I have been trying to find a DVD for this movie. Great action and fighting. I had the VCR but this is better. Sound and picture GREAT. Easly one of the best Nap. Warfare Movies.
1609419693|5.0|I bought the audio version of Bossypants to listen to while driving cross-country (I-40 is pretty straight but why not stay awake for it anyway?). I decided to 'preview' some of it for the heck of it and am glad I did. I would've been a menace on the road if I'd been driving and listening to it for the first time, what with the laughing, weeping, difficulty breathing, spastic whole-body convulsions, etc.<br /><br />I'd read some excerpts in The New Yorker and they were very funny but hearing her perform her book is fantastic. And it is a performance, not merely a reading. Her rapid-fire delivery is priceless. Her observations brilliant and twisted and snarky. Just great.
B006SVHOL8|3.0|Not really compelling at all. Very little backstory and characters were well developed so you didn't really care about them at all. Terrible waste of a great cast.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I really enjoyed this installment but it has left me hanging - so I can't wait to get started on the next one!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much even though it was an emotional roller coaster.  Colleen has become my favorite author and I look forward to future books.  She has a wonderful way of describing feelings and emotions and catches the reader.  I seem to connect with her characters like no other author.  Thank you, Colleen for writing such heart wrenching and \\"real\\" fiction with wonderful twists.  Kudos to Colleen!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I'm engaged and we have been together now 4 years. We've had our moments and sometimes I could not understand why or how we got there but this book made everything make sense. It has helped me realize what we both need and lack. I can see what we are good at and still need to work on before, we walk down the aisle!thank you so much! Every couple must read thus regardless if you're married or not
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This book is awesome. If you like fantasy you'll probably enjoy this whole series. Once again this is a well balance book read it.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|A well made movie on blu-ray, can't complain. I love comic book movies and this is one of the best.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|I find myself comming back and playing this game over and over.I cant seem to stay away from it very long due to the fact it reminds me of the older arcade games from the 80's.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book was really good. It jumped around from topic to topic but ultimately tired everything together. Highly recommended reading material.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The continuing saga of the Borgias is stunning.  I look forward to the Third Season...may it get here soon.  I am only disapointed that it takes so long from season to season.
B0090OPC2S|5.0|This is the great Talich Quartet set so long out of print.  The highest quality of performance.  Intimate.  As we listen we are in a small room overhearing Beethoven hum.
