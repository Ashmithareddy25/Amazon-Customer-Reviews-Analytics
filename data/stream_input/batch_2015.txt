B000SEI230|5.0|Heartwarming story... I laughed and cried my way through this book... Loved it!!! Hated to see the story end..... 5 star book
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game. Puzzles are no too challenging but graphics were great. Definitely better quality and more entertaining than lots of the games out there. Loved the storyline. Highly recommend
B004UFEJW6|5.0|Put Kurt Russell in the future as and aged ultimate killing soldier that is kick to a waste planet with people living on it. The new commander is sent to get rid of these people because they are a problem. New soldiers against old soldier. Kaboom. What a fight. This movie is a little unbelievable, but if you can put that aside. It is a great moral booster for the downtrodden against the state. I put this movie in my collection because it is 'put that fight spirit in your soul' movie. Fun to watch. Enjoy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this puzzle game.  It's really challenging as you get into it.  It was so hard for me to put down.  One problem, I want more puzzles.  I did also get the bridges version of the same game and it is even more challenging.  If you like this type of puzzle game you will love there's versions.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|This movie is up there with the &#34;Rocky Horror Picture Show&#34;. It is scary and funny. It is the precursor to the &#34;Army of Darkness&#34;. Another hilarious hoot. I can watch these movies again and again. If you are in for some scare, blood and laughing. Get this movie. You won't be short changed.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|It was ok, good effects but story line and just over all wasn't as good as I thought. Little below average.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is really the best game ever. Way better then mine craft our any other game like this out there. It is so real life in an animated game. Not even kidding get this game. You will be hooked.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun but it can get a little boring at times other than that I wood recommend this game to other people!!!:)
B008518MOW|4.0|I thought the movie was great, but the 3D portion was not up to my expectations.  The 3D graphics were not much better than the Blue-Ray version, and for the price difference, I was a bit disappointed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I would have gave it a five star rating but one day all my survival games turned into creative games.One that was turned into a creative game had diamonds. That's PRICELESS.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I purchased the original in Blue-Ray and really enjoyed it.  The 3D version surpassed the Blue-Ray in all aspects and I think it is the best 3D movie that I've seen so far.

B005DN5BE4|5.0|this movie put some light on the roots of the African America history.  I very please with it and will watch it again.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|It is not the worst movie of the year, at least that much could be said for Tim Burton's Dark Shadows.  Fans of Burton's films pretty much know what to expect here:  an Elfman score that could have easily come from any other movie he scored; the screen-stealing presence of Johnny Depp; supporting actress Helena Bonham Carter (who wields a pretty decent American accent in this film); and gorgeous landscapes-oh, the landscapes and set designs are the best part of the film, as it usually goes for Burton.  Dark Shadows also boasts a respectable battery of supporting actors/actresses in Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz and Jackie Earle Haley.  The downside:  Depp's portrayal of Barnabas Collins is so utterly over the top and hammy that one wonders how he and Burton were ever allowed to get signed off to do this film; the script is about as imaginative as what you would expect a fusion of Dick and Jane and the Hardy Boys would result in, but to give it its due, what the plot lacks in originality (or even homage to the original) it more than makes up for with wild careening inconsistencies; the climax plods and the ending is about as hackneyed and as give the people what they want trite as you could ever hope for.  Please, please, PLEASE keep Burton away from remakes as he has f'ed up Sleepy Hollow, f'ed up Alice in Wonderland and royally f'ed up Willy Wonka.  Now Dark Shadows can be cast to that pile---would that it could be sealed in the coffin that Barnabas Collins was and sealed away for 200 years.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well written, well casted, well acted series. Plus the research and attention to detail is impeccable...can't wait for the next episode!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|A good read.  The Distant Hours includes terrific character development and Kate Morton has done an excellent job of painting a picture of the time in which the story is set.  The story is poignant and melancholy which, I think, was the author's intent,  I recommend the book.
B003CHGV74|5.0|This is amazing, have bought and received this as a gift. You won't recognise Hal from Malcolm in the Middle!
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|I watched this with my college student daughter, who was familiar with this movie from its associated TV show.  For me, a person in his early 60's, this movie was somewhat curious.  It was never clear to me how seriously the narrator Nev considered his relationship with the web-based identity he was following.  Nevertheless, he pursued the objective of seeking out this person with admirable relentlessness and compassion.<br /><br />In a way, this story reminds me of a science fiction movie or Star Trek episode, in which a human being discovers that the visitor from another planet (of the apparent opposite sex) to which this human being is attracted, is not even vaguely human.  Indeed, the besmitten human inevitably discovers that the beloved has donned a technologically sophisticated disguise.  In fact, this is such a common science fiction romantic plot that it is even a part of the amusing Star Trek parody [[ASIN:B005721W9O Galaxy Quest]].
B002TYZKIM|3.0|I bought this as a gift for a fan of bad and thriller, they loved. I've watched a bit too , event though I'm not a jacko fan it's still very entertaining.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This movie was so much better than I expected! Even my wife, who was skeptical prior to watching it, thoroughly enjoyed it!
0553805371|3.0|Yet another great book by the legend from the go compare advert! Obviously not as good as a brief history but still worth the read
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I consider myself somewhat of a bargin shopper, especially for movies, and when I came across this limited edition Dark Knight Trilogy I couldnt pass up trhe price of these three great movies. I bought all 3 movies for the price of 1 1/2 movies. The DVD layout with all 3 discs was great, the movies were awesome and the price was perfect!

B008XG1X18|5.0|According to my daughter (who bought & uses the app):<br /><br />\\"This app is great. It's super fun and easy too use, but I wish that I could choose my board backgrounds from my Kindle, but I can only do that on the computer. Otherwise it's great and super fun. Now that I remember, it would be really good if we could get a pin it button onto the browser on my Kindle, so it would be easy to pin from websites, that would make it much more easy. Otherwise, I love it!!\\"

B008B37CB8|5.0|One would be hard pressed to find a debut album more challenging, confrontational, experimental, and cutting edge as Frank Zappa's \\"Freak Out!\\"  First off, it is a double album, released in 1966, containing one side of music that is nothing but a twelve and half minute percussion/noise jam recorded in the wee hours of the morning.  Spoken word segments, kazoos, classical interludes, the subversion of several musical genres, and a brief \\"Louie Louie\\" quote, \\"Freak Out!\\" contains all this and more, including some of the most cutting satire of Frank's career.<br />  The album starts off as mainstream as it will be with \\"Hungry Freaks Daddy\\", a \\"Satisfaction\\"-esque riff rocker that while musically related to the hits of the day, lyrically paints a picture of weirdos and freaks invading the comfort of middle America (a theme that would dominate this and other Zappa albums).  As the album proceeds, Zappa and the Mothers take on R&B, doo wop, love songs, and other musical genres, musically nailing the vibe on the head while lyrically subverting the genres with sexual innuendo and a cast of characters as interested in hub caps as they are in romance.  Highlights include the menacing \\"Who are the Brain Police?\\", a song that sounds unsettling even today, and \\"Motherly Love\\", one of the sleaziest groupie anthems ever recorded.<br />  If the album had ended after the first two sides (eleven satirical pop classics), it would have been memorable.  What happens next, however, elevates \\"Freak Out\\" to near perfect status.  With the beginning of side three, Zappa goes political, unleashing his first lengthy career diatribe in the blues-based \\"Trouble Every Day\\".  Frank shows his versatility with this track and then goes further into left field with \\"Help I'm A Rock\\", an eight minute, three piece movement that includes some demented a capella barbershop, healthy doses of noise, and one of rock's creepiest intro riffs.  It is scary, confusing, funny, and unlike anything you have heard before.  That is until the album closes with \\"Return of the Son of Monster Magnet\\", which, as described above, is a dozen minutes of drums, noises, grunts, and pure uncut genius.<br />  If you do not already own this album, you should be ashamed.  \\"Freak Out!\\" is a five star classic if ever there was one.before.

B008I34ZQG|5.0|\\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" is one of those Frank Zappa releases that manages to please almost everyone: newbies, hard core fans, moderately intense fans, folks who only own one Zappa album which is probably this one.  It covers all the signposts of Zappa's musical career: potty humor, satire, lengthy guitar solos, ridiculously intricate written parts, and stuff that can only be categorized as Zappa.<br />  The majority of the tracks included here were recorded live on Zappa's fall '77 and winter '78 tours, and then fluffed out with overdubs and other studio trickery.  The album starts off rather straightforward, with some Peter Frampton and Bob Dylan satire in \\"I Have Been In You\\" and \\"Flakes\\", before jumping head first into potty humor with \\"Broken Hearts\\".  It is not until we hit what was originally side two that Frank veers off into more adventurous territory thanks to a couple spoken interludes thrown in the mix and two of his most memorable solos.  \\"Rat Tomago\\" is a guitar solo taken from a live \\"The Torture Never Stops\\" and it is epic, while the side closes out with \\"The Sheik Yerbouti Tango\\", which is a guitar solo from a live \\"Little House I Used to Live In\\".  Both of these tracks alone make this album essential.<br />  After this adventurous detour, Frank gives us a handful of more straightforward songs, several of which would become or already were live staples. \\"Trying to Grow A Chin\\" is a hilarious homage to every three chord E-A-D pop song (sung by that cute little drummer Terry Bozzio) and \\"City of Tiny Lites\\" addresses pill poppers and alcoholics and includes one of Frank's signature guitar solos.  The album concludes with the one-two punch of \\"Wild Love-> Yo Mama\\".  The first, a prog-rock leaning song about dating, and the second, a bare bones, sketch of a song that makes way for one of Zappa's truly epic guitar solos.<br />  \\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" has it all.  The song writing is excellent (if not Frank's most adventurous), the humor is no holds barred and 100% Zappa, and, most importantly, the guitar playing is some of the best on any official FZ release.  This album is recommended for all!pa, and, most importantly, the guitar playing is some of the best on any official FZ release.  This album is recommended for all!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|When I saw the price of this classic Disney movie, I had to get for myself to add to my Disney collection. Considering this is a Disney classic the prices can be outrageously high, but I come to my surprise this was not. It came in great timing, durable packaging and the price was one to be beat! Very happy!

B008133MDK|5.0|OK, for years I have been a Jeremy Brett fan - as I perceived there was no one else on the planet who could play Sherlock Holmes better.  Well, I was wrong ... along comes this Benedict fellow - sweeps me off my feet - and has me comparing every man I see in the USA to him!<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is the greatest Detective character ever conceived, with Barnaby and Hercule Poirot close behind.  Notice though that I have just named ALL UK characters !?!<br /><br />Here's hoping to many many more episodes of SHERLOCK!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I couldn't put it down. The entire time I am reading it I can't stop wondering why a 40 year old mother of two girls - is enjoying this book about to college students so much. I am looking forward to the sequel!

B001KQEE0U|5.0|Pac is the best to ever do it and you can't go wrong with him or biggie but I hate how they portrayed Pac in the Biggie movie as if he was just crazy because I thought rap was about being versatile!! One minute u can talke about your homies in the street and then talk about some crazy women and give a letter to your mom. Pac showed great versatility as an artist and I will miss him

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This is a movie that is about a boy and a teddy bear he received for Christmas .  The little boy wished that he could talk.  His wish came true and he got a filthy mouthed, sexual, bong smoking bear for life.  So beware, not for kids and nothing cute about it.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I thought I was reading Twilight again.  Then the plot starts moving so fast and developing such a deep story that goes deeper and deeper.  I couldn't put it down.  I will be downloading Colleen Hoover's other books as well.  Easy to read, but surprises at every turn on a very difficult subject.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app!!!  I loved how attached I became to the horse.  Playing this was just an amazing experience.  Apps like this one are what make life fun!  Well not literally, but it is pretty AWESOME!!!  You should get this right now.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Special Agent Pendergast never disappoints.  Kept looking for the twist that would have his wife miraculously  alive somewhere, but alas, that did not happen.  Extremely well written as usual, and holds the reader spellbound waiting for the surprises.
0525953728|4.0|While &#34;No Easy Day&#34; is the most definitive reporting on the raid to date, it seems softly focused. In his efforts to not reveal any sensitive information, the book lacks the edginess expected of a first person account.  For those who found this interesting but somewhat light, I'd recommend WAR by Sebastian Junger.
B009O07NDY|4.0|The music doesn't feel quite as epic as Howard Shore's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" work, but it's still solidly entertaining, with the Misty Mountain tune and motif being the biggest unifying theme.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King delivers again in fine fashion with 11/22/63.  Looking forward to learing more about these keepers of the rabbitt hole.
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|Great background music, great cast and very realistic background research of this war loving and destructive culture.  Like with Clinton and Bush the film pointed out the constant roadblocks our administration put in place while lying to the public about their vigorous efforts to find this muslim extremist terrorist.  Waterboarding was now condemned even through it led to finding the keys to goat ranch!  I am pleased it showed the many attempts to prevent the agent from successfully finding and coordinating Osama's demise!

B00AHSMDQY|2.0|REALLY disappointed after reading the positive reviews. It felt like a real mish-mash of plot lines. Tried too hard, did not succeed. The villian's perfromance was nowhere near the caliber of Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. He sported a &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; muzzle and a dirty winter coat. Ugh!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written.  I enjoy listening to it as I can't see as well following an accident four months ago.
B000056NX5|5.0|I was able to see the original Jesus Christ Superstar live, twice in road show productions.  I have not thought about it in quite some time, but I wanted to relive the show in it's entirety.<br /><br />It was great then and just as great now.
B0089EHWQE|1.0|A most uninteresting book<br />From the very beginning the story line was very predictable. Of course the heroine was influential, of course she fell for the poor man. I kept reading to hope for an original development.<br />A waste of time.
B005DL9O5S|5.0|This is a great collection of Tchaikovsky's music.  Now people can have all the symphonies, piano concertos, ballet music, and so much more, all contained in one box.  I have been collecting Tchaikovsky recordings for over 45 years, but I still found something I haven't heard before, until receiving this set of CD'S.  I agree with the reviewer who liked the Third Piano Concerto, played by Michael Ponti.  The surprise came when I found that there are two more movements.  All the other recordings I have only have the one movement of this concerto.  The piece is stunning.<br /><br />As far as the Swan Lake Ballet goes, I don't think Brilliant Classics intended to record the complete work.  However, it is more than some recordings containing just the highlights.  I also noticed that some repeats of passages were left out, not to mention several dances.  There was a lovely violin and orchestra piece left out of Sleeping Beauty that took my breath away when I had first heard it.<br /><br />Still, I would definitely recommend this set to anyone who loves Tchaikovsky and wants a large collection of his works.
B0068MNO4S|1.0|This film is based on a false, ridiculous premise. That the aristocratic Eddie de Vere wanted to write plays for the public theater, but did not want to put his name on them because the upper class folks don't associated with the low-lifes that are in the theater business. .  Hey, the guy was a patron of two boy groupes of actors, and was noted by Meres to be a writer of comedies. Hardly a suppression of evidence.<br /><br />If anyone reads none-Oxford books, like Andrew Gurr's \\"The Shakespearean Stage, 1574 - 1643 (Elizabethan to Jacobean), There is an appendix of a Selected list of plays and their playhouses, authors, companies, and dates.:<br /><br />\\"Fair Em\\", author Anonymous, c.1590 Strange's Men at the Rose<br /><br />\\"The Fair Maid of Bristol: Anonymous, c.1604, the King's Men, at the Globe, Shakespeare's group!!! Maybe de Vere wrote THAT PLAY!!!<br /><br />\\"The Famous Victories of Henry V\\", Anonymous, c. 1588, Queen's Men, Bull's Inn<br /><br />\\"A Knack to Know a Knave\\", Anonymous, 1592, a big hit for the Admiral's Men at the Rose<br /><br />\\"A Larum for London\\", Anonymous, 1594-1600, Lord Chamberlain's Players at the Theater and Globe, Shakespeare's Troupe.<br /><br />\\"The London Prodigal\\", Anonymous, although called Shakespeare Apocrypha, a good play, 1604, The King's Men, at the Globe.<br /><br />\\"Look About You\\"  Anonymous, 1599(?),  Admiral's Men, The Rose, Henslowe/Alleyn<br /><br />\\"The Merry Devil of Edmonton\\"  Anonymous, c. 1602,, Chamberlain's Men, The Globe<br /><br />\\"Swetnem, the Woman Hater\\", Anonymous, 1617, Queen Annes, Red Bull<br /><br />\\"A Warning for Fair Women\\", Anonymous 1599  Lord Chamberlain's Men, the Curtain<br /><br />\\"The War of Cyrus\\" Anonymous, 1578-1580. Chapel Children,  first Blackfiar's<br /><br />\\"The Wisdom of Doctor Dodypoll\\"  Anonymous  1599  Paul's Children<br /><br />\\"The Yorkshire Tragedy\\"  Anonymous, attributed to Shakespeare, but not written by him, 1606, King's Men, The Globe<br /><br />  The point of all this isthat there were many anonymous plays at all times during Shakespeare's era.  He only wrotee two plays a year. His troupe may have performed some of his past plays, but they also needed new plays, even from anonymous authors. as this list shows. Some were no doubt better than others.  But de Vere certainly did not need to pay Shakespeare to put his name on plays.  The concept is totally, incomprehensible, does not make sense, and is not relevant with events in Shakespeare's world, as this list shows.<br /><br />I am not a film critic, so I will not judge the acting, directing, set design, sounds effects, costumes, and the rest....actually, I don't think that this film will convince anybody who wasn't already convinced.  If it actually did some intellectual damage on viewers, they did not have much inside anyway.<br /><br />The case for Eddie de Vere has not improved in 100 years. In Bill Bryson's words\\"<br /><br />\\"In short, it is possible, with a kind of selective squinting, to endow the alternative claimants with the necessary time, talent, and motive for anonymity to write the plays of William Shakespeare.  But no one has ever produced the tiniest particle of evidence that they actually did so.\\"<br /><br />\\"Looney never produced evidence to explain why Oxford, a man of boundless vanity, would seek to hide his identity.\\"  ....\\"All Looney would say is 'That, however, is his business, not ours\\".<br /><br />Of course, as Ogburn anticipated, Shakespeare will have to be decapitated before Eddie de Vere is made the King. And Ogburn took the torch from Delia Bacon, calling Will an illiterate country bumbkin, with absolutely no evidence that his was true, but facts did not bother Ogburtn.  What he wanted to believe, that was his own truth.<br /><br />No records that Will attended school...therefore he didn't.  That was current for awhile.  Without attending school, it is very unlikely that he would have been able to write the plays.  But \\"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\\" and if you know anything about John Shakespeare, you are pretty sure he would have walked his son to his first day of school and made sure he stayed there.<br /><br />So now we have a literate person, who can translate Latin, knows some rhetoric, and who is ready to go to London to write plays....ButWAIT...<br /><br />A new book comes out that does not deny that Will went to school, but that the school was more inferior than is stated in most biographies make out...<br /><br />And so it goes on...he had to have visited Italy...he had to have been a lawyer...he had to have gone to a Univeristy...he had to have been in the military....My God! If Will had done all that, when would he have found time to write the plays and sonnets?<br /><br />This entire bogus discussion will go on for another century, perhaps more claimants will arise....But Shakespeare's name will remain on the plays, mainly because HE WROTE THEM....
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book reminded me of Heinlein but more colorful language. Really enjoyed it greatly. Could not put it down. Hope the rest of his books are this fun to read.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|This seems like a good game just wasn't the right game for me.  I think its challenging enough just didn't hold my interest.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Carries on the Bourne series and promises to be a new trilogy of action and intrigue and Jeremy Renner's acting is true to the Robert Ludlum style.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|Songs are well constructed and performed quite well. Lead singers' unique vocal style is a plus but the lack of varied instrumentation is the only minus.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love the music - great recording quality. Yes, I will drive my husband a tad crazy by listening to it too often.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|This could have been a really good movie if Quentin Tarantino would have been in charge. The plot seems to flow to cutely and I thought the ending was boring.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I read mysteries all the time, and this one is a good as it gets. It says it is book 1 of a trilogy - when will the others be available.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I liked the game but kept running out of gas to catch the animals & you have to spend real money to buy peanuts.  I ended up not being able to play so this wan't the game for me.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|The Wi-Fi Analyzer has been extremely helpful in searching for sources in new locations and helped to identify a problem I had near my home.<br /><br />We were having difficulty accessing out wi-fi reliably, using the Analyzer we discovered everyone in the neighborhood (8-10 sites) were using channel 1 with a few on channel 11.  I shifted my wi-fi to channel 9 and have had no further problems.<br /><br />It is also handy in identifying free wi-fi networks that I can tag on to in remote areas when needed.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This has saved me a considerable amount of money since I had spare chargers for my existing laptop.<br />The price of a spare charger is around $79.00, so I was happy to see this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is fun and it doesn't freeze up. I think little kids would enjoy it just as much a adults or teenagers. I recommend it for anybody looking for a great game.
B005ES0ZKS|5.0|I started wearing it and now i stopped wearing any other footwear. Very comfortable and ideal to wear in any environment. Ofcourse not for construction sites though.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I brought this for the grandkids but I found myself hooked on it. the game doesn't have any violence, sex, or foul language in it and that is always a plus
B00991TCOG|5.0|This girl is SO talented.  Buy her album, and check her out on youtube!  If you like the violin and creative twists, you will be amazed with what she does.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Joe Walsh's new release is new for him and I enjoy the acoustic soound coupled with his new songs. This album is growing on me with only a few plays.<br /><br />Excellent album.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very good  story.  Can't wait for rest of series.  Hope they make this into a miniseries for TV. Good read
B002361MLA|5.0|I rate this book a 5+ it really made me take a look at my life and problems I am facing and taught me how not to dwell on them and actually live in the Now. I cannot predict the future and I cannot change the past. I can only live the Now! Thank you so much for helping me start living in the Now.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this  game  perfect for passing time and u get to ride a cute dragon named mr cuddles!!  you have to get it ts extremly fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible. I like the plans feature that helps me keep on track with my readings when life get really heckit.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I started reading this book, I was sure where the author was going with the story, but once it turned with a twist I was so hooked and couldn't put it down...love this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It has been years since I have been reading so much. I love to read but my time is extremely limited due to my profession. I just could not carry a book with me everywhere as I used to when I was younger; but I do carry my cellphone everywhere! Now I just select my Kindle app and begin reading whatever I like. Kindle has a huge selection of titles available, many free. After years of not doing it, I am back to reading every day!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|....is hard enough for anyone, but for a severely different face to appear in a culture of school children, their parents and the school staff, it is heart rendering in many ways.  This author attempts to capture not just the boy's feelings about joining this world for the first time, but many of the key people in his life.  I loved hearing about the same event being described or reacted to many by the various players in this story. It is about opening your heart and listening to everyone's story, not just the most &#34;obvious&#34; story in front of your very different face.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Most of us have seen the MGM version, but I suggest read the book. This is only one in a series of Oz books written by L Frank Baum and it is probably the best. Go back to a simpler time in your mind and read this book
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is the basic of this game and I love the challange in my spare time to just sit and play
B005NJU8PA|3.0|TF forced this one. It is a disorganized mashup of previous work (old blog posts) and new work that is difficult to read. Here is a sentence from the book: &#34;Hahahaha.&#34; Except that's not actually a sentence. The writing/editing is too casual even for someone expecting a casual tone. The reason I give it 3 stars instead of 2 is because there is valuable information about learning and cooking hidden in this mess.
B0086449YA|5.0|This guy is legendary. I saw one of his concerts at the Ryman in Nashville and will never miss another chance. Highly recommend all his catalog plus a lot of Dire Straits
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I loved the book and his new main hero character.  This is a story that relates to what is going on today.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This was a great movie to watch with the family. All time classic. Glad i was able to share it with my kids.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I've read most of the reviews, dont really think I can add to them but will say I truly enjoyed this book...looking forward to the authors next project.
B00A757EFW|5.0|My oldest grandson seemed to be fastinated with this old style games like the ones his mom and dad played as kids I think I'll keep this one awhile.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My husband bought this game on his iphone and I was pretty bummed thinking the whole amazon only thing on my kindle fire would prevent me from getting it. but super excited here it is and I love it! he paid to unlock the different types of plagues and a few other things but I'm going to enjoy unlocking everything as I go, and there is a lot to discover!!! very dynamic, catches everyones attention although that damnable siren that goes off about killed me a few times so I remember to turn the sound off now!! looking forward to any new developments in this game and will be keeping an eye out for any new games from these guys :)
B000NY12CI|5.0|Infidel is a remarkable look at a world we don't hear much of in the West. There were several times I almost put the book down for good.  Sometimes out of disgust, sometimes I thought it dragged because there was a lot of repetition.  However, I gave it a 5 star rating because there was a lot of courage and a message that needed to be told.  In short, Ms. Ali was born in Somali, raised in Kenya and then eloped (without the groom) to the Netherlands.  There she was able to educate herself and find work.  She became a naturalized citizen of Holland and then went on to be elected to the Dutch Parliament.  Normally, this would be a rags to riches kind of read, but the overlay is that she was raised Muslim with tight loyalties to the Quran and the tribe.  Hence, the remarkable journey of a woman crusader against domestic violence and equality for others like herself when her upbringing taught her complete obedience and submission.<br /><br />Two things stood out for me: 1) the barbaric sexual slavery and domestic violence and 2) her stance on integration of immigrants.  It is one thing to read the words \\"genital mutilation.\\"  It is quite another to understand it by reading about the process and the lifelong cruelty attached to it.  I still have a lot of nightmares after reading this.  I liked what she demonstrated about her willingness to work and not take government hand-outs.  I found her analysis on immigration and integration into their new homeland was very insightful.<br /><br />I had read some of the reviews on another website that said that this book was biased, that there are peaceful Muslims, and that the end got too political.  The book is a biography with a strong message to help other Muslim women.  So, yes it will have a bias.  It isn't hidden and a bias isn't a bad thing.  Yes there are peaceful Muslims who are happily praying 5 times a day following the Quran to the letter.  That still does not change the fact of what Ms. Ali says - there is a lot of suffering to women caused by the constraints of their religion.  And I don't see how the end could help being political, she was after all, in Dutch politics by being elected to the Dutch parliament.  When Parliament tried to revoke her citizenship, that was political.<br /><br />Domestic violence is an issue that concerns me, as a family law lawyer and former prosecutor.  Nobody has the right to beat another person.  I don't care whose authority it comes on.  And just because a woman is raped, does not mean she deserves to die.  The courts trying to enforce sharia law in Michigan brings the issues closer to home.  Domestic violence isn't an isolated issue from Somalia or Kenya.  This book gives a good background from where the underlying beliefs come.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I purchased this book for my Kindle having read an article in the CT Post about it.<br />It is very engaging. I could not put it down.  In fact, after I completed it, I searched for other books<br />that the author previously wrote.  Found one and read that as well.  Also satisfying but not as<br />compelling as &#34;Me Before You&#34;<br />I highly recommend it as a great read.<br />MJ
B00004CXIE|1.0|the DVD that I was sent must be from Britain or somewhere else because my DVD players says it will not play this foreign disk . you should post that on the website!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book and you will never guess what will come at you next.  Everyone should read it and take from it lots of life lessons.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My oldest grandson is hooked on Angry Birds and this is the twist with the side of the pigs very interesting and it is creative thinking I love it
B005K17RU0|5.0|As good as any other weather app that I have seen used on my cell phone.  No complaints about it.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|My kids and I are very much looking forward to more and more movies like this. One of the best movies made these days.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful characters you will love and hate. Steamy yet fun sex and lots of emotional highs and lows. A fun and engaging story. I absolutely LOVED it.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|It was disappointing that people bought them out and resold them on Amazon for quadruple the price. It's a cute little set, my daughter is a huge fan and this was all she really wanted for Christmas. So, I had to spend $130 when the original price for this set was $35. For my daughter I was super excited, but for my wallet, not so much.
1442346949|5.0|haven't listened to Killing Kennedy yet, but the steve jobs entertained us all the way from NY to southern Fla. driving
B005HSL626|3.0|The grandkids like this one but its a litlle messy(fruit juices going everywhere LOL)<br /> they play it occasionly but there is not that many varations so they get bored with it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love hidden object games. This one is by far one of my favorites. Loved all the levels, and the extra game. Hope there is a sequel.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Movie was really good but tended to be a little dark. Tended to have a little lag to the movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Each time i start  my tablet, i go straight to my battery app to see  how much time there is to play. I love it.. Thank you.
B003RV43X4|4.0|I loved the original so i wanted to see the updated one- Action packed and good movie for the price!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It had been awhile since I had read Tom Clancy and Threat Vector reminded me, again, just why he stays so popular. TV is well-paced, with memorable characters, and down right scary if even half of what he writes is true, and with Clancy, most of his books are based on excellent research.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|My grandkids didn't like this one so I deleted it from my kindle. I do not know why they didn't like it
B0086700CM|5.0|It is amazing. I play it all the time it is very addictive. Those that created this app took the time to great a very great game.
B00A136CUI|5.0|Obsessed with this version and all 23 songs included. I haven't bought a full CD in a long time but I'm so glad I did. Worth every penny!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I did finish the book but only because I was hoping that something good would happen.  When I read a book, I like to escape everyday ordinary life and be swept away from my normal reality.  All the characters in Casual Vacancy had many flaws, there was no hero or heroine, it was tragic, very sad and depressing.  I bought it because I loved of the Potter series and I was bitterly disappointed.
B004W4N55C|1.0|Don't waste your money. This app hasn't worked since ICS. The cheaper guitar tabs without tools works great though. It force closes as soon as you try to sync your favorites or type in the search box
0345410025|5.0|I just seen this book in my roommates room and I became curious. I grabbed it and starting reading it to see how well it might help. With carefully reading this book I was able to recite all 50 states and in order. This book links words and thoughts of images that all relate to each other. I recommend this book if you would like to learn of different techniques to help improve memory. This just needs to be practiced often so it can become long term use.
B0063IH60K|3.0|this is an old favorite and the kids love it to. Could be a little more animated though for the grandchildren
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I use  to play world of war craft and gave it up a while back but so love this game because it takes me back. Love the graphics but wish u could have more healing potions. I got the fairy that heals but to tell the truth she sucks! They need to do something about her powers. But for the most the game is awesome and its a great way to kill time.
B002VH7P4O|3.0|The apple arrived with the stem sapped off even though the excellent packaging from the Apple corporation and Amazon was totally undamaged. The fact that the loss less playback does not function with most of today's electronics is not the fault of Amazon. The MP3 playback is beneath the quality of the music contained in the USB drive. I accept the fact that most people use this format and probably don't even realized the reduction in sound quality.
1450400957|5.0|My son has gotten into weight lifting and our &#34;workout&#34; library needed a bit of expansion. This book shows him all the muscles and how they respond to each exercise. It also helps him to plan workouts by showing him single muscles or compound. It's great for beginners or those who haven't been working out very long, like my son, who just started this past year.
B0085A9J18|5.0|I my! Wow! I watch this movie on cable last nightit was out of this world action! Nonstop action of intense fighting scenes1 The way they were fighting was supurb fighting skills and nonstop on and on! They were making me tired! It is like their energy was in triple overtime to fight so long!Some caution in the highly violence and the use of knives,machetes cutting and stabbing people,and guns I think I only saw 2 women in the entire movie.There is this 1 guy towards the end will make you say,\\"size does not matter\\"! He was beating the crap out of men double his height!  I think the movie is from Malaysia.You have to read english sub-titles.It was easy to follow the story all the way.It is something to see a drug war lord  and his bad guystake over an apartment complex that was in ruins and people still live in it!The police were surely not prepared for them! This is a must see movie indeed from last year!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This book is a little bit confusing in spots.  It was not one of those &#34; can't put down&#34; stories. I had some unanswered questions.
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandchildren and I love this game and it was free. It is easy for young children to play with no violence.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u love horse games get this one!! It has good help and horse<br />&lt;3 get it. It fantastic and u crazed horse lovers get it
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This is probably my favorite book of the year. It is very well researched and every chapter provides exercises and practices to prove to yourself the efficacy of its conclusions. Additionally, this book is very well written and engaging. McGonigal has a wonderful writing style that makes you feel as if you are sitting across the table from him the whole time. As a professor myself, I recommend this book to every class I teach because willpower is a key ingredient to success in every area of life.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app works great!!!! Have it on both my ZTE. Sequent and my Kindle Fire....Love it--the only bad thing I can say about it is I can't set a picture for the card background on my Kindle but I can on my phone...would definitely recommend this app to anyone
0307592731|5.0|While I was initially hesitant to read this book, I can say without a doubt it has been a very inspiring and delightful read. If you have any interest in what it might be like to hike solo on the PCT, this is the book for you.
0743270754|5.0|I'm almost through with reading the book and have found it very interesting how Lincoln became involved in politics, and then worked his way through the various challenges. The author did an amazing job of researching historical data and individual correspondence (150 pages of acknowledgements) to pull out a realistic story of our government at work. I am definitely looking forward to reading more of Ms. Goodwin's books. It would be good for our elected officials to read this book and learn how one keeps the focus on what is best long-term for the country!
B004I744AS|5.0|I've already used this one often school work almost always requires a dicionary. This one even provides links to other helpful informational sites
B001UV4XFG|5.0|It was a nice movie thank you so much. it was the best thing i ever go. :) gabby says... LOVE IT
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I READ THE FIRST 6 CHAPTERS AND GAVE IT UP. IT IS TERRIBLE. NO STORY TO IT AT ALL TO KEEP YOU READING. IT I WANTED TO READ REPEATED SEX SESSIONS I WOULD BUY A PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE. THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE. I ONLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE GIRLS I WORK WITH READ IT.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|well, maybe I have a few :) SO. GOOD. YOU MUST READ THIS. I CAN'T HANDLE IT. okay but seriously this book is fantastic and I cry every time I read it. So well written it's actually ridiculous, and I really identify with the main character.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Patch Adams,<br />Inspiring, medicine based movie, where humor is a large tool in this doctors bag.<br />Handle with care, each patient is just a little different
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This book has it all!  One can learn just about everything one needs to know about life and how to live from reading this book.  It is an all time favorite of mine, one I recommend to everyone.  No one's ever been disappointed.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Not only is this a big favorite of the grandkids my husband is now hooked. It is a good clean game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the series, couldn't put them down!  Waiting to see if the next movie will live up to the book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is off the chain!! I certainly recommend this to everyone who loves horses!!! This game is the best horse game I've seen so far
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can see how you can get a diamond sword or a bow and make huge buildings<br />And the sound of zombies next to you is a little freaky
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars because it was a great book. Couldn't stop reading it once I started it, and it grabbed me and didn't let go till the end and when I finished I wished it wasn't over! This book had a lot of life lessons that could help a lot of people going through every day in this world that these characters went through and shows that you can overcome tragedy. Can't wait to read another book from Colleen Hover.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was a page turner from beginning to end. The characters were complex and diverse! I could not put it down. I even gave my kindle to my husband so he could read it too and he loved it! I can't wait for the next John Grisham Book. Thanks.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I am a writer and a reader. I love to read others works and I couldn't put this one down. It is a great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|one of the best games ever!I personly love it.The pictures are amazing.I suggest getting this game very much!Plus its free.

B0014JLYPQ|1.0|[[VIDEOID:moF76HS003RADE]]im a full time chef and receive the crocs about 2 weeks ago and soles are already coming off. this is the first night i have noticed because i tripped because of them and i am sure within a  couple of days they will come off.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I received my Kindle Fire after I gave my wife a a Kindle HD for Christmas (my wife passed her Kindle Fire down to me and I love it).  My sister bought a bright pink cover for my Kindle Fire while my wife owned it.<br />I am not comfortable with bright pink (except for fishing lures), so I bought a black cover from the same company; MicroShell.  It is everything I wanted in a cover.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|this one I liked at first but after awhile I was bored with. I haven't deleted it yet but I would not recomend it to anyone either.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|We used it for the first time last night.  We have a small room that without it we would have to stand on the couch to play.  However, we were playing Raving Rabbids and at one time the kinect wouldn't recognize my movements and had some of the characters behind us on the couch so it was impossible to play that portion.  I think we still have some kinks to work out but so far it has been fantastic and much better than without it!
B00005JNJV|5.0|the best batman series<br />saw this when we were in middle school and loved it<br />highly recomend<br />really good buy

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great books can't wait for the second movie to come out without giving away the ending I never expected that ending
B005KDWUG4|5.0|Muy contento con esta compra, el DVD en perfecto estado, nuevo y el tiempo de envío fue muy rápido. Muchas gracias! Recomiendo adquirir sus productos en este lugar!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like temple run but in a silly way My sister and I are hooked and play over facebook. I would recommend it to everyone. The Grandkids love it to. It is easy enough for a 4yr old and entertaining to a 90 yr old. It has no volience/sex or foul language. It is a big winner in my book.
B00867GJYK|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies.  We have never had any problems with it and our 2 year old can name almost all of the characters
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Said it had arrived when it hadn't. When it did arrive the package wasn't even sealed,no invoice, so don't know if I got everything? Thought I was suppose to get headphones- none were there.?
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|it restarted me at a level but someone went on my kindle that wasn't supposed to so I'm not shire if they messed something up or if its the game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was good and better than the movie. I am going to go buy the second book right now. Hope it is as good
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A fun game with loads of different boards to keep you occupied and entertained, definitely a good game for a majong fan.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Probably one of the best romantic comedies I've read in awhile. It's a bit on the short side yet delivers a story that grabs you from the very beginning to the end.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We saw the 3D version of this movie in the theatre and love it then.  So, when I saw it for sale I couldn't resist.  This is such a great movie for older kids (because of the story line)
0385344228|5.0|A great read.  This story kept me turning pages well into the night. I'm anxious to read more by this author.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a fun game to play to either pass the time, or I can even do it without sound while relaxing in the evening with my family.  My daughter and I play against each other to see who can get a better score.  Would recommend to anyone.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I chose this rating because I am very disappointed that I can only take pictures of myself.  I had to buy an app to do that.  I was all prepared to capture the activities of my family and am not able to do this.  This is not what I expected.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Although i wasn't sure this book would appeal to me based on its description, i could not have been more wrong. I was immediately captivated and had a hard time putting it down!!! Highly recommend!
B000UAFDP2|5.0|cheap hd quality good conversion nice seeing buigs in hd everything bout the movies is alot better good digital remastered good price
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This seller has been fantastic.  I at first didn't give this product a very good rating because of the sound issues on the third disc.  I sent the first one back and got a full refund after have two conversations with the seller.  I reordered from a different site from the same seller, since they are the cheapest for the whole collection.  I wound up having the same problems but after getting on line Disney knows about it and it is a simple fix on my blu-ray player.  Love this seller and their products!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book was exactly what I had expected it to be. She is hilarious and so witty! I was really sad when I finished it. You won't be disappointed.
0761171703|5.0|My daughter is Teaches at the university of Florida in their Art in Medicine program. She was aware of the research for this book but didn't know it had been published. She was very pleased to receive it as a gift this Christmas
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I stayed awake well into a couple of nights reading this tale. I Am looking forward to reading more of Mr Howie. Recommend highly.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book was good but in my opinion it wasn't one of my favorite diary of a wimpy kid book. But over all it was good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse! I want a horse of my own, but science that isn't going to happen, I entertain myself with my horse
B00684J49U|1.0|Nearly every disk skipped, and I missed whole portions of the show. I was very upset. Not worth it at all. DO Not order used anything on DVD!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It just kept getting more and more interesting as the book went on leaving little clues about things not feeling just right and they tie it all up into a pretty little knot at the very end. I love the twists and turns and the young love that is desperately trying to find its way. Great read.
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|James Taylor sounds as he did 40 years ago.  Very pleasant to listen to along with old favorites Nat Cole, Johnny Mathis, etc.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|Ira Sachs' latest feature captures the beauty and challenge of living and loving without shame. In this personal and intimate story, the viewer follows two young men as they navigate their relationships with one another, their community, and their professional lives.  Grappling with addiction and co-dependency, disappointments and successes, and the ups/downs of being a couple,  Erik and Paul gradually learn to accept and embrace their own humanity. In the process, they find it is necessary to let each other go. Deeply moving and brutally honest, Keep the Lights On is not afraid to portray imperfect people living as best as they know how.

B00A4TKDKY|5.0|I was happy to see the shipment at my mail box what a speedy service i liked it keep it up
0062200909|5.0|Bought this for a Christmas gift for my niece and she loved it.  She is 17 and a big fan of the Hobbit series.  She really like the book a lot.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|This was one of the better uses of the Austen characters and continuations of the story. But, written by P.D. James, how could it not be? I thought she kept true to the original characterizations and didn't try to make us overrfamiliar with characters likely to remain reserved in their behavior. I felt the plot got cllumsy toward the latter part of the story and ended somewhat blandly. But it kept me reading all the way through.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My daughter and I love Downton Abbey.  We got this and nearly finished it on a long, rainy weekend.  Perfection!
1118232658|5.0|From the very first video that led me to the book, Erik Qualman has created a very authentic read on how social media has and continues to transform the business landscape. Practicing what he preaches, he used a well-produced video that illustrated not only the facts that he was sharing, but also the medium by which new ideas and concepts get disseminated by going \\"viral\\", to demonstrate what social media is.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to local business owners, consultants, and to any marketing executives across all verticals to enhance their knowledge of social media and to provide a framework by which new strategies may be forged to capitalize on this tsunami-sized opportunity.  And if you haven't seen the video, check it out here: [...]
B007FG9LIE|4.0|A man wakes up next to a river in a beautiful enclosed valley. He has very few memories and a lot of injuries. This is how the main character, Ethan Burke, enters the story. From that point on it is part psychotic thriller and part action adventure. Ethan remembers he is a Secret Service Agent and a name keeps coming back to him. That name is Mack. He's pretty sure it's not his name because there is a good bit of fear associated with that name. Early on he remembers he and another agent were in Wayward Pines searching for two missing Secret Service agents.<br /><br />From the first paragraph I was hooked on this story line. The plot is strong and the character development of the protagonist, Ethan Burke, is very good. Especially when you consider the character starts the book with amnesia. Through murky flashbacks and a consistent drive by the character to learn who he is and why he woke in the town of Wayward, Pines.<br /><br />Every time I thought I had it figured out another piece of the puzzle fell into place. With strong characters and a solid, somewhat original plot this is a very good book. It is an action adventure with two parts thriller and one part science fiction.<br /><br />When I rate a book I do not always look for plot, setting, and character building. Of course those items are taken into account but my rating is based partly on the mechanics of writing and partly on how much I enjoyed the story. Keep in mind that it's hard to enjoy a story with a plot full of holes, weak paper thin characters and an almost nonexistent setting. I really enjoyed this book and gave it a four star rating. I'm confident anyone reading it will also enjoy it as long as you like a good thriller full of action with just a bit of science fiction thrown in. Hats off to Blake Couch for a very good story.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|I was somewhat disappointed.  Not nearly up to his previous books seemed like he had trouble finishing off Harry.  Do wonder what he will do next.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Hard to beat Tom Cruise and the fact you can stream it to the comfort of your own home and not pay the high box office prices is great.  Enjoyed it using my Roku device.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A total emotional roller coaster ride...like all of Martin's works.  Once, just once though, I want the GOOD GUYS to win!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Shocked me how the US never got his music, his messages helped start a revolution in South Africa in the 70's...<br />In my opinion, his albums merit to be listened to at least once by anyone who has some sense of social and personal awareness-
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I found this movie to be extremely disappointing in content (however, the graphics were beautiful).  I will not be showing it to my 8 year old daughter.  The main character, Merida, gives her mother a magical cake without even knowing what it will do to her.  That is completely irresponsible and disrespectful, and not the kind of message I want to give to my children.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have been a Vince Flynn fan for a little over a year. In this past year I've read all of his Mitch Rapp books, thirteen in total. These are the type of books I would love to write but never will. They're full of action, espionage, politics, and explosions. I finished The Last Man about a week ago. This was number thirteen in the Mitch Rapp series. I believe this is the best book yet.<br /><br />It opens in a safe house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Four dead men are lined up on the living room floor. Mitch Rapp, an operative for the CIA, has just arrived and is studying the bodies one by one. These are not bad guys but the CIA's own men who were body guards for an agent who is now missing from the house. This begins a trail that goes from Afghanistan to Washington DC to Switzerland and back and forth.<br /><br />Most of the characters in the book are regulars that have been carefully constructed over the last twelve books. They are well rounded and you will feel like you know them. A few new characters appear in this book and surprisingly one character, Louie Gould, who appeared in only one other book. He is an international assassin who, in an attempt to kill Mitch Rapp, accidentally killed Rapp's pregnant wife. In The Last Man he's been hired to kill Mitch again.<br />The settings are sometimes all too real and always add to the characters. The plot is strong and straightforward with a few surprises along the way. If you like action and adventure you'll love this series of books.<br /><br />Since I've had my Kindle I always give the books I read a rating when I'm finished. If you have a Kindle you know that when you reach the end of a book you are given the chance to rate it one to five stars and write a short review. I believe this is one of just a few books I've given five stars. I recommend this book but I was you and haven't read any of the Mitch Rapp books, I'd go to Vince Flynn's web site, [...], and find the chronological list of his books and begin with American Assassin which is Mitch Rapp #1.h Rapp #1.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I have this app on my iPhone 4s and love it.  Tried downloading it on my kindle hd and it does not work properly.  When I try opening up the plans section it will not open!  Very frustrating!
B003BWERF8|4.0|I use this with my ipod classic 160gb.  It has great range, probably up to 150 feet easily.  I love not having wired headphones anymore, but the only draw back is that it is slow to pair with my headphones.  That could be the headphones and not the transmitter.  Great little invention.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I hated to see this show go off, but now I will never miss it again.  I can watch it anytime I want to with my own collection.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Shocked me how the US never got his music, his messages helped start a revolution in South Africa in the 70's...<br />In my opinion, his albums merit to be listened to at least once by anyone who has some sense of social and personal awareness-
0062082353|3.0|I would've liked more info from some of the battles in the field. It seemed most of the great stories were in the middle of the book. The beginning and ending were somewhat bland and drawn out, but ok. Overall, it was a decent read. Kudos to all our troops. It's too bad Chris was killed later by a veteran with PTSD he was trying to help, he'll be missed. Definitely a military legend.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Kind of slow.....would have liked to have remembered more about Jane Austen!  Not as good as her other books.  But then again she is almost 90!
B008K7WCJM|5.0|And, the crazy s***, really, is that all the powerful imagery that's been exacted by the suffocated listeners is true.  No more of that description, right now.  To codify the concerts of Gira and his brethren is to say that the Swans family unleashes new mythology in live performances.  Michael detests his audience members wearing hearing protection, but it is a must, because, otherwise, you and your friends would not survive.  Some unsuspecting line-goers 50 feet and 75 feet plus from the stage, outside on the sidewalk of the concrete block Tremont Music Hall in Charlotte, NC (Oct. 20, 2012), became a tad concerned when they heard the horror of sound check.  Other shows I have witnessed:  The Orange Peel, Asheville, NC Sept. 10, 2011 & Lincoln Theatre, Raleigh, NC Oct. 14, 2012.  The shows were all different, and precisely reflected the moods of the crowds.  And, please, the folks in these reviews that found Swans only recently, you must go back and start over!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have fallen in love with Downton Abbey and most of the BBC. The acting is superb. The writers do a great job. I like how there are two separate stories going on between the &#34;upstairs&#34; and &#34;downstairs&#34; and how they all flow so well with each other. The costumes, the scenery, the cast makes this my favorite show in a long time.
B0058YPILY|5.0|A complex television series that I love to watch over and over.  The DVD collection allows me to do just that!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Hard to believe that Taylor Switch is such a versitle artist.  I had her last album and this one blows that last one away.  Not so much a country album at all.  very upbeat and creative.
1442474440|5.0|Treasure Island has been an old favorite for several generations.  I thought my grandson, age  10, was about the right age to read it.  But the edition at Barnes & Nobles had terrible illustrations.  I remember loving the illustrations in the edition I read.  So explored the editions available at Amazon.  From the reviews, I thought this edition would suit my needs.  It did.  The illustrations are excellent.
068981528X|2.0|The book is cute, engaging and sweet. My kids loved it. I can't stand it, so I am getting rid of it. It leaves me with the impression that the author believes that people are aggressive because their victims are defensive. Reading the part where the wolves say \\"there must be something wrong with our building materials\\" after the pig destroys their highly defensive homes makes me incredibly uncomfortable. This is not just saying that you may be able to repel evil with kindness. It is saying evil exists because you resist evil.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Ending was sudden but I would read it again for sure. I can't wait to watch the movie now! Haha
B00005JMJG|5.0|No seriously guys, this movie gave me an epiphany. Watching it for the first time was one of the most enlightening experiences of my life.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It took a little while to get the hang of it but once it did I find it to be a great game to challenge the mind & for that matter my eye sight.  Being a young senior I recommend this game for any one who would like to keep their minds sharp
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is one of the most touching books I have ever read. If you love to read love stories, you must read this book!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Who is Wes Anderson's Art Director?<br /><br />I knew from the first frame I would love this film.  Composition, quirkiness, underlying genius, all of Anderson's trademarks embodied long before the first word of dialogue.  Gotta love this man, he is a unique voice, an impeccable filmmaker.<br /><br />Honoring his first actors/devotees/stars, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman join in the fun, adding offbeat panache in colors only they, unique craftsmen, could muster.  And nothing quells a brief rush of joy when Francis McDormand sneaks onto screen as a militant mother who shamelessly smokes indoors and wrangles her brood using a megaphone--there is no doubt she will turn in a layered, thoughtful study.  With Bruce Willis headlining, Tilda Swinton and Ed Norton round out the all-star ensemble supporting two child-star leads (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) and their story of pre-pubescent, town-rattling, romance.  Innocent, mostly, as adventurous, this is not to be confused with a children's movie.  Adult themes outweigh what's childlike, even as kids out-number adults 5 to 1 in this flick.  Think 48 Hours Missing Persons meets Teletubbies, and you're getting close to where Moonrise Kingdom's rating should be.<br /><br />For the rest of us, especially the &#34;well over 18&#34; crew, Moonrise is rare cinema candy with great performances, welcomed simplicity and trademark Anderson uber-creative strokes.<br /><br />Gerald Sullivan, by the way, is the Art Director here.  And his work here is Oscar-worthy.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Wow. That may be the best concert I have ever seen, and I wasn't even there. They transcended age, time, everything. \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" was really the only low point, they could have left that out, with JPJ's plodding keyboards. High point, surprising to me, was \\"Dazed and Confused\\", not completely because of Mr. Page, but he sure helped. \\"Kashmir\\" was another show stopper. Proud that they avoided cliché by tossing in an understated \\"Stairway\\" MID-set. Also fun watching the old guard admire Jason's closing to \\"Rock and Roll\\" like proud parents. My highest recommendation and not just because of nostalgia, this one was truly magical.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a GREAT book. It leaves you hanging most of the time and I could barely put it down!!!!!!!! I recommend this book for EVERYONE.... it's a really God book, and I think Suzanne Collins is the best writer ever.
1580084621|5.0|This is the classic Thai compendium for all lovers of Thai food.  This will tempt everyone to give it a go.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|One of the best books I've read for a long time and one where I frequently had to brush my wife off from reading it over my shoulder. The idea of people travelling and telling the tale, with frequent hilarious flashbacks, is probably not new - but then what way of telling a story is - however, this story is so brilliant and so well told that one can ask for little more.<br />Full marks for such an enjoyable and hilarious story.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The grandchildren turned us on to this movie.  Another inspiring movie on standing up for what's right and just. Good conquers evil.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|My 8 year old loved this movie.  She loves the music and the jokes!  She could watch this over and over
B009NOVCTM|5.0|A great Rolling Stones CD. You'll love all the old songs as well as the new songs great listing .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cool graphics, keeps me occupied. It's a bit of a pain to get coins and gems and there's long waits for stuff. But... THEY HAS UNICORNS!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was an inspiring book, full of the challenges of life being overcome! It's encouraging to see that God was at the center of his life through it all. He was blessed with an awesome wife, family, and friends for support. He remained true to his calling & overcame superhuman obstacles. The book was an inspiring read throughout! I would highly recommend it!
B00A8Z6KN8|3.0|It's good, but maybe not as memorable or long lasting as the Lord of the Rings scores. Time will tell.<br />There are a few strange differences between the theatrical release score and this album. I'm thinking it has to do with last minute editing done to the theatrical release.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a  classic movie that is worth havinging in my collection.  It is funny and informative. You don't even notice the subtitiles
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Slow, no Batman through most of the movie.  Plot really made no sense.  I cant begin to tell you how glad this series is over.
B009B0L324|5.0|Very good live CD by AC / DC. Would recommend any AC / DC fan to buy. Will enjoy listening.
B0000DZTIL|4.0|Classic movie of the 80's - a good Sci-Fi movie with a hippie science teacher Dennis Hopper, about a time machine
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun game it passes the time and my daughter loves it (: I also play it to pass the time when I am tired of my other apps it is kid friendly and easy to play(:
B008QTVNUI|4.0|The best thing about this show is never really knowing who is the craziest between the CIA operative and the terrorist.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This dictionary is an inexhaustible source of knowledge. You look up a word and learn so much more in the process. It entices you to explore further. And it's fun to use. I never enjoyed looking up words, now it is a pass time. Like others say in their reviews, it's my favorite app
B004KRWQLU|5.0|This album is a must-have!  Then again, for me ALL Alice Cooper albums are must-have albums for every collection.  Buy Today!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It is very easy to use. The Merriam Webster dictionary is well known to be an accurate and authoritative dictionary.
B002B4OVWG|5.0|Our kids love it, it is a crazy situation with it they love the monkey pacifier. Good product and beatiful desing
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|he is as always 5 to 10 years ahead of the times. 8 more words required is stupid. one two three four.
B008Y2VTIS|2.0|This is the second time I've bought a video on amazon.  Both times the quality has been terrible and very fuzzy.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This pushed the limits on a lot of subjects, nice not to take life to seriously for a change.  If you want a good chuckle this is a good one.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Haven't read this since I was a kid, still a great read, recommended for younger readers as an introduction to Twain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|play this game because its awesome,  and so addicting. I cant stop playing this game!!!!!!!! I love this game and know you will love it too!!
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|Download time was long..but overall the process of buying and viewing was easy and convenient! Will buy more movies through amazon again.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Good for a demo! I plan on buying the full version if the price goes down a bit. Also, a good seed I stumbled upon is cowcowcow. Excellent flat space straight ahead and wonderful mountains and caves to the left. Limestone found right away! Easy to find copper (TONS of it) and coal.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|Great Discovering Murakami is a tremendous spider that takes you slowly into his very poetical and dreamlike world. I loved this book all the time.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Good movie to see it once.<br />I prefer the original though.<br />Good effects. My wife didn't like it because of too much shooting and fighting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a good game.it is just like temple run but more kiddish.I honestly really liked it.  it does have one flaw which is to buy characters with coins were so expensive
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Quick read, well written, from the standpoint of an intelligent dog. The book was a little emotional for me to read at this time, having an old dog myself.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I had heard this was a very funny movie, and it was.  It was also beautifully done.  What was siprising to me is that it is an &#34;old school &#34; Disnery Musical.  Yes, the pictures are CGI generated as opposed to hand drawn but it features music on par with say Hercules, which was a pleasent suprise.  I'd reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of the mid Diseny classics (aladdin, The little Mermaid, etc).
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down, the twists and turns were so unexpected. Very well written. I am recommending it to all of my friends.
B004XQO8VO|4.0|Great movie that goes beyond the post-apocolyptic future that many action movies diverted us into. If you can use the seashells, let the rest of us know so we can be prepared.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I kept hearing really bad reviews on this movie, but I am a Bruce Willis fan so I decided to try it anyway....an I'm glad I did! The movie was more of a comedy farce....but it was funny to me an I think they got away with what they were trying to pull off! The movie arrived on schedule an in great condition. If you're in to comedy I think you would get a kick out of this movie. I recommend it.
B0086700CM|3.0|temple run is fun but subway surfer is way more fun its addicting and you can compete with your friens on facebook
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I after watching the trailer and all the previews I thought this was going to be a great movie. Unfortunately, the raunchy language went a bit to far and was so repetitive & predictable I became bored & fell asleep.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I'm loving Courtney Milan for historical romance. clever and right on the edge of the industrial revolution and changes. I recommend the duchess war and the brothers sinister series.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Great sci fi movie!  I would definitely watch it again ...even better than the original.  Not much more to say.
1558908846|4.0|Obviously it's not a cinematic masterpiece, but this is one of Stallone's better movies that wasn't made into a six part series. Action, comedy, and a little bit of drama.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|saw it at the movies an it was such a better movie than part one was that when it was offered I bought it! Duh? I don't remember what I was thinking? Indeed it was a &#34;better&#34; movie....but? The movie arrived as promised in good condition.....but I have to say, it took a lot out of me to finish watching the entire thing. definitely not recommended for the grandkids...an not a movie I would watch over an over again. So what was I thinking? Don't know but....not on my highly recommended list.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|This is a true masterpiece, one of the best nineties records and undoubtely one of the best ever debut albums. This super de luxe edition comes full of extras, the original album is in the first CD remastered for this edition, another CD contains the usual demos, and there are two DVD with two live performances, one is the 2009 concert in London to cellebrate the Christmas number one in UK charts, the other contains their first Public performance. The box also includes a poster, a big book with photos and a 180 grams vinyl original album's copy. A big cellebartion for a récord that deserves it. Congratulations!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is great for horselovers and is never glichy or blurry on kindlefire graphics are good and its very fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is just fabulous.  highly recommend. for those long commuted on train like I have to do everyday. the time just flies by.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It seems ridiculous to add another 5-star review to a series of books which already has so many, but I simply can't help myself!  Ever since the tragedy of positive reviews that led me to purchase the Shades of Gray series (ugh, regret!), I have been skeptical of mass book reviews that are as glowing and happy as those submitted on  behalf of the Wool series.  But I'm so glad I took the chance this time.  These stories are absolutely engaging, disturbing, and entertaining.<br /><br />Really good books make me feel as though the stories are continuing without me whenever I don't have the good fortune to be reading them.  As if the characters and plots are developing and living and reacting, all while I'm taking time out to work or unload the dishwasher.  With this series, I felt like I was missing it whenever it wasn't right in front of me.  I can think of no other way to compliment the character development and story-telling talent of this author than to say I felt this way about these characters and this story...a feeling I get from maybe two or three out of every fifty books I read.<br /><br />This story was worth every penny and every minute I spent shutting out the \\"real\\" world...one that I now think I may not know everything I think I know about it thanks to this tale.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I liked the intertwined plots that involved the upper crust with the servants. There is irony as well as loyalty that made me cry with them when life delt a blow. Life spares no one, no matter what your position is in life.
B0087GJ8KM|3.0|I usually evaluate how thought provoking and intellectual a book is by the number of my highlights and let's just say I only had a few.  This book was rather disappointing since I really enjoyed Daniel Pink's last book \\"Drive\\" and was excited to read this.  Unfortunately, this books seems forced and the narrative other than some historical/background information rather falls within the realm of recycled and repackaged self-help / pop science genre of Malcolm Gladwell, Jonah Lehrer-likes where the book is basically a summary of research papers that confirm the author's theories...If you are new to sales or basic human social interactions this could be a great book...
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games series is the best book series I have ever read, I recommend this book to everyone..I could not put any of the 3 books down!
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|Great movie with a lot of great action. it will keep your eyes glued to the screen. I highly reccomend watching...
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Its OK but notThe Panther , Does not come up to his usual standard, too slow and far out, can you beleive this?  I'll try something else next time
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Very poor movie for being science fiction.  Not worth the money spent. The movie was right down boring no real action. The motorcycles had fairings that looked like apple crates.
B00933JF74|5.0|I keep going back to this game when I want to play a game and relax. I have hundreds of apps but this one I can continue use. I like building my city until the map is full. If you like Cesar, or Tropico you will probably enjoy this game too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|just struggling to find 18 words to say that it was a fun read and everything I expected it to be.
0345525558|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time, it was very moving and inspiring. I would recommend this for everyone
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found the book hard to put down once I started it. Looking forward to the next  book.  The writing seemed to be written with a younger audience than what I had expected,
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun but I don't want to spend real money on in game currency. I wish there was a better way to get gold.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book.  Kept me hooked from the beginning until the end.  Best first kiss ever I think!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I have always enjoyed the music of Phil Collins from musical arrangements to the lyrics: thoughtful and well done.  I am a fan.
1439127700|5.0|This highly enlightening and most well written book had me interested from beginning to end.<br />The inter-action between presidents of opposing parties was something I could never imagine<br />after the rhetoric during the election process. How heart warming to find that so many of these<br />powerful men can and do help each other during the changes and while new presidents are in office.<br />I quite understand how lonely the office and service to the country must be. How great that each<br />outgoing president is ready to serve in a helpful way to the incoming president. Some surprises in<br /> the book but always gripping and interesting. A must read for all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for my 10 and 14 year old girls.  They play it a lot and worth the price (free!)

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is by far the best of the Slenderman games for mobile devices! The graphics are good and the sounds are really scary, especially when you have a headset on! I'm hoping for more maps soon and maybe some additional interaction (opening doors, picking stuff up, etc.). Recommended for Slenderman fans!
B002SYXCVK|5.0|I loved that from the beginning of this CD there was not a typical Christmas song.  The harmonies are unique and some of the songs unfamiliar, that is until I listened to it over and over this year.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|never stops moving and keeping you interested great movie.  Christian is at his best again.  lots of great characters but not for kids.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book, and highly recommend it to anyone.  While reading, I had to stop and Google this author and double check that it REALLY was a true story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great App.  So easy to use and convenient.  It is easy to download and has great value thought it is free.  Get It!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Fantastic condition as it came in both DVD and Bluray disc. Had it digital code intact aand in prestine order. Well packaged, instant delivery and well cordinated. I would recommend it to anyone.
0446580848|3.0|I absolutely loved the build up and psychological inferences of John Corey and his wife! I loved the second thoughts and questioning leading up to finding The Panther! What a missle dud! The book never explored in-depth the wacko Anti-American priviledged American! Then the ending was so disappointing..what? 2-3 pages..an assault..a trip over a sleeping body..and a struggle that lasted 15 seconds with a terrorist who killed the sailors of the USS Cole and then THEN..no conclusion on the CIA guys who tried to whack Corey, his wife and the others! SO DISAPPOINTING!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is getting better and better! His characters fairly jump off the page AND the reader actually becomes better informed on the goings on of our world, because Flynn does an excellent job researching his work!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|hilarious and tacky not something your used to seeing Mark in but he does  great job playing stupid...I'd rather see him in action..
B009JBZH54|5.0|From the beginning the score just grabs you.  It feels like a heartbeat and I felt that it fit in with the story of something beginning or growing so to speak.  Excellent actors, Morgan Freeman...grasp the roles they were cast and are fun to watch.  We watched the set over 3 nights, after our little one was in bed...not kiddo friendly...and my husband who always falls asleep watching movies had his full attention grabbed.  The Dark Knight...wow. Heath Ledger stole and owns this film.  Such a loss, it was intresting to see how the villians from previous films are still out and about needing smacked around from time to time.  Harvey Dent...kind of a shifty character but is still likeable. Terrific.  The Dark Knight Rises...the opening sequence involving a plan hijacking is just great and the plot twists and turns are fun and suprising at times.  I even teared up a couple times watching the third movie.  Anne Hathaway did a great job as Selina Kyle.  My only complaint is the fact when it is a speaking/acting sequence...difficult to hear..so you turn it up then when something explodes it is sooooo loud!!

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I have always loved this game. After I downloaded it to my kindle fire, it said I needed to update it and get more space. It's fun buy not necessarily worth it.
B005XN0SGU|4.0|Prior to discovering this app, I was using Calibre to convert all of my comics into .mobi and it worked fine that way. That is until I lost all of my files and had to start over. Considering the amount of time it took the first time to do it all and the amount of space I didn't really have to do it again, I decided to consider looking into apps that allow me to just drag and drop my .cbr and .cbz comic formats and then let me access them on my Kindle Fire. At first I didn't think I'd find such an app that would let me do this. That is until I scoured a forum and someone suggested Perfect Viewer.<br /><br />Perfect Viewer has allowed me to read my comics without having to convert them and for that, I am glad I took the risk and bought the app without the guarantee that it'd work.<br /><br />Now why, does an app that does its job scored 3 out of 5 stars? Well, the app isn't exactly simple to use. I cannot move my files over onto the bookshelf which annoys me. I have to drag and drop my comics into the Books section of my Kindle Fire and then access the books section via the Perfect Viewer app to open the comics.<br /><br />Another problem I find is that it is very touchy. If you touch certain points of the screen it'll change the size or move to the next comic or zoom in. I personally do not like that but I cannot change it. I also hate that even though my Kindle Fire's screen is on lock mode, this does not apply to the app.<br /><br />The flaws aren't bad to the point that it takes away from the basic function of the app, so I'd still recommend it.<br /><br />Edited<br />I would actually like to increase the stars to 4 because after tinkering around a bit, I realized that I needed to create a folder for my comics and that once I did that, all I had to do was go to the tool button, then click on \\"bookshelf settings\\" followed by \\"bookshelf management\\" at which point you add the folder that you created and then after you locate it and click on it, then you will press the scan folder now button. After this, it will scan all the comics in it and it will then appear in the bookshelf. voila!<br /><br />I love this app.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Married people and people who have been married and those thinking about it should all see this movie.  It is funny, yet,  SO TRUE!!!  Tommy Lee Jones is just perfect as the &#34;stuffed -up&#34; husband who lets everything go until there is no turning back.  Of course Meryl Streep is great.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl and Tommy are at Twitter best.  some really great &#34;ah ha&#34; moments.  this felt like you were watching a real couple.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this series since I was 14 years old. I've spent a large chunk of my life anxiously waiting for each new book to release. It feels strange for it to be over. I have grown fond of all the characters and the world that Mr. Jordan created. They are like old friends. Despite the flaws of WoT, it is an epic, wonderful series that everyone should read at least once (if not a few times!).<br /><br />I thought Brandon Sanderson did a fantastic job taking up the mantle. I can't imagine what an undertaking this was and am thoroughly impressed with what he did. The book focuses mainly on the Final Battle, with an intense, hundreds page long chapter, titled the same. The book does a good job wrapping up the different threads of the story. All I can say is wow and sniff.<br /><br />There are a few things that stood out, both good and bad (no spoilers - if you read it you know what I'm talking about. If not... Go Read!)<br /><br />- Lan, seriously, badass. Seriously.<br />- Bela!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />- Egwene...<br />- Not enough Nynaeve.<br />- Strangely entertaining - Prevara and Androl... I thought I would get annoyed, but no... just adorable.<br /><br />What a wonderful ending to a wonderful series. Thanks Team Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.

0349001359|5.0|This book was so damn relevant it was too good to be true. When I started reading I really couldn't put it down. It was such a good book that breaks your heart at the end but makes a raw and true statement. Chris Colfer surprised me since I've never read anything from him. As a teenager I could identify with so many things the main character was going through and it really helped a lot. If you like The Perks of Being a Wallflower you really need to buy this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a reader.  I absolutely love to read and most likely read one to two books a week.  I picked up this book after finishing &#34;The coincidence of Callie an Kayden&#34; which I loved.  This book did not leave me hanging like &#34;The coincidence..&#34; I read it in two night.  I highly recommend it.

B005OV0PS2|1.0|It freezes up after about 20 sec's of watching. No problems with any other disc.  Bad copy. I wish I could get a replacement..
B007TK77QE|4.0|It is unusual for a book to kill off the hero in the first few pages, but somehow Rowling manages it when her arguably `main character' Barry Fairbrother collapses and dies in the very first chapter. It is the effects of Barry's death on his seemingly idyllic hometown of Pagford which open the windows into the inner workings of the town's people.<br />Following this blunt beginning, the reader is allowed entry into numerous homes in and around Pagford and offered a sample of many types of the English way of life.<br />The story revolves around the town council, and who will take the place (the `casual vacancy') left by the deceased Mr Fairbrother. However, it is not really about a town's election at all - if it were I would certainly not have made it through the book's 500 or so pages - it is about the social politics behind it - the judgements cast both intentionally and unintentionally by every member of society. Nobody gets off lightly in this book. Everyone is a villain to some extent.<br /><br />That's almost the problem with this book; although it is possible to relate in some way to many of the characters Rowling writes about (unfortunately so, in most cases), it is difficult to sympathise with them because without any real exception, they are all, in some way, unlikeable. The only character who is portrayed favourably is Barry Fairbrother, whose existence goes no further than chapter one (and I have a suspicion that if he had survived into the meat of the book I would have found myself disliking him also).<br />But that is realism; nobody is 100% likeable, not in today's society at least, and the fact that the readers can see this shows how clever Rowling's writing really is, and how keenly observant she is herself.<br /><br />Why did I like this book?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Casual Vacancy, despite some of its vulgar language and imagery (probably best not to let your Harry Potter obsessed 10 year old get their hands on it), and happily give it a high rating (it might have received a 5/5 had I felt a little chirpier throughout the process of reading it, but then it never claimed to be a `feel good' read).<br />I love Rowling's writing. I loved Harry Potter, and I loved this. There is a world of difference between the two, so much so that it is hard to even compare them, but her clever writing, 20:20 observation of human interaction, and neat intertwining of storylines hasn't changed, and that was what made me fall for Harry Potter in the first place - not the spells and flying broomsticks. Also, to me this book was a little bit like a soap opera (except about one hundred times cleverer); the way that the tales of at least 15 different people were told, and yet they still contained enough detail for you to feel like you really knew each one of them (knew, not necessarily liked).<br />The Casual Vacancy was just my cup of tea, and I would highly recommend it to fans of realistic fiction, Rowling's writing style, and watching the soaps!<br /><br />Who would not like it<br />To rephrase that, who is less likely to be impressed by it - who am I to say what you would or wouldn't like?<br /><br />If you are into fast-paced action novels, this one probably is not for you. It is slow moving and totally character based, but if you can get into it it is definitely worth sticking with.<br /><br />If you are looking for another Harry, you won't find him here. Harry Potter has left the building, but Rowling's smart pen skills have not.<br /><br />If you are looking for the warm and fuzzy feeling that some books give you, I would not recommend this to you. Nor would I recommend it if you are easily offended, or do not like to feel lectured at when reading for pleasure.<br /><br />Other than that, if you want a realistic look at our society from behind closed doors, I say give it a try.<br /><br />So, while you won't find any wands or wizards in this book, I would say Rowling's magic is only just beginning.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|We turned the movie off. It was horrible. There were a few funny parts but overall the level of stupidity was too much and we couldn't watch any more. All about a teddy bear and his friend who get high every day and can't grow up. There is a lot lacking in the story line to make it even slightly entertaining.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|The album itself is flawless, but the stupid downloader thing Amazon has that I had to use to get the songs on my computer was horribly confusing.

B00A8KJN14|5.0|I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, but that's not to say he hasn't disappointed me with some films (DarkShadows, Corpse Bride) personal taste I'm sure. The Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite, artwork wise, of Burton's.  This movie was the first in forever that felt close to that, with the dark humor and step-by-step shots, which makes it so time consuming but do worth it in the end. I also saw an ode to Beetlejuice with the rat coming alive,I loved it!<br /><br />The Pet Cemetery itself also seemed like a nice nod to Mr.King, master of horror, and there were many other nods of inspirations throughout that I loved. Frankenstein's Bride, for example, when the poodle took a shock from Sparky and her hair shot up and changed to that perfect color! What a tribute! There were many more, but I digress!<br /><br />I loved Mr.Whiskers and his poop omens, how sick and strange and perfect for this weird little world! And Creepy Eyed Girl! Too Much! What I really loved Were the extras showing the classroom and all the characters and little pieces, I just wanted to reach out and play with them, very cool!<br /><br />The video by The Plain White Tees was a really good song as well. I hadn't heard anything from them since \\"Delilah\\", a song I love, but thought surely they were a one hit wonder. The song they did for the DVD was pretty good though and maybe they'll make a comeback!<br /><br />I also liked getting the digital download because my six year old loves this movie as much as I do so it's nice we can take it with us on the road now for her.<br /><br />Was also happy to notice Ms. Ryder's voice right away, and enjoyed get character as well. I really loved the storyline though, as I love my dogs like my kids, and they are just as loyal and dear as little Sparky, who reminded me of my doxie throughout with his antics. Even my bf, who never cries, cried when Sparky got hit by that car, never mind we both knew the premise of the movie was him coming back to life, but it really was heartbreaking.<br /><br />Such a good film, instant classic, must see. Highly recommended, seriously, go watch it now! This is one to buy, not rent, for sure!s heartbreaking.<br /><br />Such a good film, instant classic, must see.

I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to be pulled into the story, wondering what's around the corner, and hoping not to be sent to cleaning.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Finally, a beautiful story about a young girl that isn't all about falling in love and getting a man! I mean, really, we need to stop teaching our daughters this! And Brave begins with this independent sassy girl who hates being prim and proper, would much rather be a tomboy and shoot arrows and ride her horse. She's still a girl and just not ready to grow up. She reminds me so much of my  daughter, Ella.<br /><br />Spoilers Alert Ahead, scroll to bottom to avoid!<br /><br />So when her parents announce she will be married off to keep the peace between the Kingdoms, she is beyond unhappy. Merida doesn't want to be a PRINCESS, let alone a WIFE. Her mother just won't listen, and her mother, the Queen, thinks Merida just won't listen, either, as peace is at stake if she doesn't comply. Neither understands the other.<br /><br />When the suitors arrive, her parents announce only the firstborn from each royal family may shoot for Merida's hand in marriage, which gives Merida a great idea. Being the excellent marksman, or girl, that she is, she announces after everyone has gone, and shot poorly, that she will be shooting for her own hand.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite scenes as she really defies her mother here, publicly, while rejecting all her suitors and standing up for herself and what she wants. Of course, her and mom get into a major fight, in which the Queen tosses Merida's precious bow into the fireplace, breaking her daughter's heart and sending Merida running from her home on horseback in tears.<br /><br />Soon, she discovers a witch, whom she begs for the power just to change her mother. Merida hopes this will change her mind about the whole marriage and be done with, things can go back to normal. The witch gives her a tart to feed the Queen, promising her mom will change.<br /><br />What Merida doesn't expect is that her mom changes into a bear, the very animal her father hates the most for taking his leg. The witch promised her a change, but her mom changes physically, not internally, like Merida expected. Fearing the King won't understand or believe his wife is a bear and may try to kill her, Merida and her mother flee the kingdom.<br /><br />They of course return to the witches Hut to no avail, she simply left a message about fixing what has come undone by the next day or permanently becoming a bear, but the witch herself is gone.<br /><br />Frustrated, guilty and sad, Merida tries to care for her mother and apologizes as they make do I'm the wild. It is entertaining to watch as the prim and proper queen turned bear tries to keep her manners about her while in her new form.  She makes eating utensils from branches, just to have them fling about. She tries to slowly eat fish at first, making Merida cook it, before impatience kicks in and it isn't long before she is ravishing fish cold and alive with get bear claws.<br /><br />The two begin to share and form a new bond as her mother lives as a bear in the wild with Merida, doing things and learning things from her daughter.  Merida, in contrast learns more about the different Kingdoms and their fall as they stumble upon another bear, this one once human also, cursed like her mother,a part of what she thought was just a fairytale proved to be true. Merida finally sees the importance of all the Kingdoms uniting, and her role in it, when she realizes how they came apart; with this one brother, power hungry to control them all, became a beast. This bear who took her fathers leg.<br /><br />Thinking they must return home to repair a tapestry, they sneak back into their castle, where they find everyone growing more restless. Merida decides to announce her decision, but her mother, posing as a bear statue at the back of the room, redirects her otherwise. Finally understanding one another, through time spent and a bond deeper than any ocean, this mother and daughter love each other so much.<br /><br />By the end of this movie, I had shed more than a few tears and was glad just me and my daughter were watching it together the first time. She came and sat on my lap in the theatre, she's six and doesn't often do that, so I think it affected her greatly, too. When it came out I managed to get it on Black Friday and put it up for her for xmas, along with a few other Brave goodies. Ella was thrilled, she loves the movie so much, she's watched it almost every day following xmas the first week and often since then. She took the regular dvd copy to her dads so she could continue watching it there.<br /><br />Such a brilliant movie, and I was thrilled it didn't revolve around romantic love for a change, as that seems shoved down kids throats these days with Disney princess'and all, not that we dislike those movies, this was just VERY refreshing and heartwarming and a great mother/daughter movie that we continue to enjoy and love together.

B000Q04XDY|5.0|After reading this book every non-Muslim should become Islam-phobic.  Pay particular attention to the concepts of The Doctrine of Abrogation and how it's used to lie to non-Muslims, what is required under dhimmitude when Islam wins over a culture, and Quran Sura 3:54 which explains the character of Allah.  The section on the Crusades is an eye opener and would lead one to believe that western civilization has much to be grateful for because of the Crusades.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|The latest in the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly, The Black Box, more than delivers.<br />While this book is part of a series featuring the wonderfully named detective, Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch, and there are rich rewards for readers who have followed the life and adventures of the main character, the beauty of Connelly’s books means that new readers can come to this book and still receive so much pleasure – the type that comes from reading an author who is a master of both his craft and the genre.<br />Now a member of the cold case squad, Bosch, who has been given an extra five years on a special contract (DROP) so he doesn’t have to retire, finds himself reinvestigating a murder he originally encountered twenty years earlier. Back then, a young and lovely Danish reporter, Annika Jeppersen, was shot dead during the LA riots. Due to the increased crime at the time and the demands placed on the police, Bosch was forced to hand over the investigation to the Riot Crimes Task Force and the case was never solved. It was one that never really left Bosch and when it’s handed back to him two decades later, he determines to uncover the murderer, even at the expense of his reputation and his job.<br />The “black box” is the name Bosch gives to the one piece of evidence that, like the black box flight recorder in a plane, explains all the other clues, creates a clear context that leads to the murderer and often the motive. Working alone, Bosh is at first unable to piece the evidence together, but when he discovers the all-important “black box” everything changes. Bosch’s instincts that Jepperson’s death wasn’t simply collateral damage from a city out of control, but the result of a deliberate murder, proves right. What Bosch doesn’t expect is that this discovery will lead him to uncover a conspiracy that goes back decades and involves people at the highest levels…<br />While the novel contains the usual elements of suspense and the inevitablepiecing together of the murder puzzle and coming to grips with suspects, what makes the Connelly books terrific is that all of the nuts and bolts of crime writing is interwoven with aspects of Bosch’s private life – the way he struggles to do the right thing by his daughter as a single dad and the growing pains of a new romantic relationship – giving him extra dimensions and humanising him in wonderful ways. Bosch is so ethical and yet, he also doesn’t suffer fools, endearing him to everyone but his superiors and the criminals who often underestimate him.<br />Connelly has this terrific capacity to make even the predictable (in terms of the investigation) unpredictable and when Bosch makes a few poor choices, his future in terms of career and even his life, keep the reader guessing.<br />If you enjoy well-written crime and great characters, then make sure you pick up Connelly. I did and my only regret is that he can’t write faster!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|The slight curve at the pommel allows for cutting using mainly the wrist as you would a parang. The sheath is adequate, but I decided to go with the Browning BKD122 7&#34; leather sheath (less than ten dollars at Amazon). With a few modifications it works fine. The angle of the forward grip matches perfectly with the angle on the sheath; better than the original sheath (mine left a small gap). Overall, a great bush knife at a fantastic price.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|It was a nice reading, the style, the story and the rhythm makes it is a page turner.<br />however I would emphasize some points that I didn't like or enjoyed during this reading :<br />- the characters are too much manichean - the bad guys are stupid and have only bad intentions and the good people have a great heart and values... :-( a little to simplistic for my taste<br />- we don't see the perspective from the Nazi or from the Japonese or from the Spanish - only from the &#34;winners&#34; of the war. It would have been so much better to have some inside story from the &#34;other side&#34;.<br />- the story focuses to much on the characters and we don't see as many interactions between the characters and the History with a capital H as we did in the previous book &#34;fall of giants&#34;<br />- I was a bit disappointed also by the fact that nothing surprised me, you could see everything coming from the first pages of every chapter.<br />definitely a bit disappointed with this book from Follet who can do such a better job.<br />As a French reader, the perspective is too simplistic again for such a complex conflict, yet he had all the ingredients to do a better job...
B0065GC0PG|5.0|Talk about judging a book by its cover! While searching for a completely different book, I found Cinder, book one of The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer and was intrigued by the stunning cover - it's one that warrants closer examination and functions beautifully as a metaphor for the entire story. The title grabbed me as well as I adore retellings of the old tales (if they're done well) and \\"Cinderella\\" (the Grimm and earlier versions) was always a particular favourite.<br />Set in the city if New Beijing, in a future where World War Four happened over a hundred years earlier creating new geo-political allegiances and countries, the Moon is not only settled but is populated by a hostile race of \\"Lunars\\" who utilise \\"magic\\" (which is rationalised scientifically) as a form of control. Furthermore, a strange plague is decimating the people of the city of new Beijing. This a science fiction novel par excellence that dives straight into the story and lets the world building occur organically, within the telling. Cinder, the main characters is not only a cyborg, but a gifted mechanic who works in a crowded bustling market where she is all but ignored by the other retailers, but not customers who appreciate her talents. But it's when one particular customer enters her premises, that her life changes...<br />Following the fundamental tropes of the original tale from which it draws, and paying homage to Anime at the same time, Meyer's book nonetheless manages to offer something unique. While Cinder is an orphan who was adopted at the age of eleven and lives with her step-mother and two step-sisters, there's a prince and a ball, that's where the similarity really ends (bar a couple of additional bits, but I don't want to spoil the story). Cinder is a loyal and courageous young woman whose self-esteem has been crushed but not broken by her step-mother. Her talent as a mechanic allows her a level of freedom and access to others, as does her friendship with and ability to repair robots and her own mechanical limbs.<br />Aware she is a cyborg and that they're regarded as inhuman and less than second-rate citizens, Cinder harbours no ill-will, only a painful awareness of her lack of worth which translates into an acceptance of sometimes harsh and unfair penalties.<br />When the dreaded plague impacts upon Cinder and those she loves, and the hostile Lunar Queen descends to earth with an offer she won't allow to be refused, Cinder is forced to confront not only her past, but her destiny as well.<br />Tight prose, believable characters, a once magical plot grounded in science and futuristic tropes, this is a terrific read that should tick all the boxes for lovers of science fiction, romance, recast fairytales and just well written imaginative novels. It also explores friendship, xenophobia, disease and the terrible toll i! takes, loss, refusing to be victim and staying true to oneself.<br />The ending sets up the next book in the series reasonably well, though also obviously if not clumsily (when you read it, you'll see what I mean - the action/motivation doesn't quite ring true - I don't see why what's suggested has to wait). Nonetheless, I am looking forward to the next novel in this series very much and will be interested to see how Meyers, who used the original tale so well thus far takes this beloved character and plot into new territory.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Good quality and no commercials. It is so easy to grab it on amazon.com. No problem with the streaming. Thanks!
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed Bared to You.  It was a fun, easy read with lots of steamy scenes.  My only criticism was that it had many similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey.  That being said, I did like the characters, and was interested to see what would become of them in the remaining 2 books of the series.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|Overall, it was an entertaining movie. Not usually my type of film but I thought it was good despite that :).
0345803485|4.0|First I'd like to make clear that I read all 3 books and I believe it's hard to write an accurate review without reading the entire story of Ana and Christian.  I have read a lot of the reviews as well as the discussion threads.  Many people really hate this book and I can somewhat understand their point of view if we are talking about FSOG (book 1) only.  I wasn't especially impressed with the writing as many aren't and repeating of the same phrases, expression, etc was somewhat tedious, although not enough that I didn't want to finish it.  For me the first book started to come together and develop in the second half of the book.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into all the details of this book, I would just like to say that if you read this book and are able to get through it giving it a 3 star or better, than I think you will definitely be interested in reading the remaining 2 books and see how Ana and Christian's story develops.  It's about two people coming together and having to overcome many obstacles, having to accept aspects of each other that they never dreamed they would be faced with.  Having to compromise and not let their preconceived notions of the kind of relationship they thought they would have keep them from being together.  To me book one is just the beginning of the story, it's not the entire story and it shouldn't be looked at in that way.  Also, if you're looking for BDSM you're not going to really find it in here.  To be honest I don't know what BDSM really entails...and I don't really want to, all I know is it's not in here.  The reason I'm pointing this out is that there has been a lot of hype about that aspect of the book as well.  I don't think the sex was ever supposed to be BDSM.  It's supposed to be about this man who always engaged in it and this innocent girl he fell for that couldn't totally accept and agree to what he wanted (this is where the compromise part comes in).<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very compelling storyand I do plan on reading these books again.  I know that many found book one to be worthless but like I said previously, it's only the beginning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For quite some time my daughter has encouraged me to read this book.  Because was not an avid reader she finally got me to see the movie.  Which I enjoyed.  It was not until recently that decided to read books. When I came across the free sample on my kindle it caught my attention so I borrowed it from the digital library.  It is written in a way that keeps you wanting more and now I must watch the movie again.
0316010669|5.0|This book really delves deep into the psyche of the average person, a topic that I find interesting. It does it in a way that is very easy to follow and Gladwell manages to make otherwise dry academic content, dynamic and fun to read. This is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys psychology and human behaviour on a deep instinctive level.<br /><br />In summary, great book. If you're in doubt about what to read next, I would say get this book right now.
B003719G40|5.0|It is a classic. Naturally grown out of experience. It has made a difference in my family life already. Thank you
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you are looking for a classic. Read this one. It reveals much about life lessons and will leave a piece of the story with you forever.
0545265355|5.0|I liked the first book the best but all three are good. I went all the way through the three books without taking a break. Great purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very realistic. this is a great game for horse lovers of all ages. sound effects are awesome as well. my horse away from horse
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|If your expecting a remake your in for a surprise. This movie is a bit darker than the original. Action scenes were nice and so were all the different weapons the Judge had at his disposal. Most of the movie takes place in a giant apartment complex (like a futuristic ghetto projects type place) and I wanted to see the judges roam around the city a little more. Also would have been nice to have a little more background on Dredd. But all-in-all it was a fairly entraining 1.5 hours. 3.5 stars.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I always heard people talking about meeting long lost friends on facebook, but I did not know how to set it up. My grandsons set it up for me. I have enjoyed it so much except for the request for games. I enjoy knowing when someone's birthday is, but with facebook they make it so you can slip up and get involved in the games. I think you should be able to get to the birthday page without being afraid you will mess up and get involved with the games. I am an older lady so I do not know very much about the computer. So to give facebook a review, I have to say I have enjoyed meeting up with old friends and catching up about our families, but we could do without the games
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I work nights and forget to dvr all of my shows.  Easy way to buy online and use my iPad to watch.  Love it!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I enjoy it but don't use it to often.  Won't play it out in public or at night while people are sleeping.
B003JBI4F0|5.0|Short review, but what more needs to be said?  Love this book, love everything about it.  Great for beginners to intermediates.  You'll learn everything you need to know to write basic to intermediate VBA, and then you'll have one of the  greatest references known to man.  The best part is that the author is pretty funny and keeps your interest as you read, so it doesn't feel dry, not on any level.<br /><br />Great book, would highly recommend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this stupid game.  Won't say how much $ I've spent to get devices to play it.  I highly recommend it.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Throughout the movie I remember thinking, man up bitch, regarding Shia Saide LaBeouf's character. The rest of the characters more than made up for this wimpy character though. I definitely recommend this movie. Did I mention that Shia  LaBeouf is a wuss?
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Awesome story line. Very nice make up job. The end was a huge shocker. I have daily conversations with random people about this movie because its so good
B0050D3XAG|5.0|The movie is very good I do own the Blu Ray version. I am in the market to purchase the 3D but I will never pull my money folder out of my pocket before I see a maximum price of $24.95.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great book!  If you like Tuesdays with Morrie or The five People You Meet in Heaven, you will enjoy this as well.  This is a quick and easy read.  It does make you think as there is a lesson to be learned.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved it. couldn't put it down! very addictive!!! cant wait for a sequel. will definitely recommend to all my gamer friends!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun.  Haven't won it yet, but, you know, lay of the cards and all that.  It's an old friend.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was pretty predictable but I was still entertained. I really like the music and the dance moves.<br />There was a little drama, a little romance and a lot of comedy.... which I really liked.
1455519006|5.0|cheaper , than barnes by half ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Excellent story, but a tough read for the average reader.  I do have a couple of middle school students who have enjoyed it, but they typically skip to the part that is in the movie.
B005HT400A|5.0|It will seduce , enthrall and excite but what will it do to your mind ! Above extraordinary and a driving reminder of the influence of celluloid . Cinematic ingenuity gauaranteed. Isabella Rossellini spangles the screen with brilliance .
B009LRE040|5.0|Christopher Nolan and the entire cast wrap up the Batman Trilogy with plenty of action, but also plenty of human emotion. The story telling is beyond compare!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|At first i was skeptic of this show, Oliver Green- the Green arrow, if you like smallvile probably the best show ever!!!!!!! you will like this show, it starts off slow, but gets better and better which is good now days, considering most shows start off with a bang, this one builds up and keeps getting better :)
0425252868|5.0|I started reading this book (which was actually given to my husband)on a Saturday afternoon; finished it the next Sunday evening.  One of the most riveting WWII stories I have read to date (and I have read many.)  Adam's writing is engaging and he can re-tell a story in such a fashion that you want to know more about these people even after you read the last page. I learned more about the air forces of both governments and the code of conduct than from any WWII book thus far. This one should be made into a movie.  This story must be retold in every medium possible.
0393338827|2.0|Ever since Liar's Poker, I think Michael Lewis' books are a coin flip. Moneyball was great because I think Michael Lewis understood the topic. The Blind Side was just fact finding and writing about it, just like this book.<br /><br />I stopped reading it and decided to return it. I found the book, &#34;Why I left Goldman Sachs,&#34; explained the crisis pretty well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never fails to pull on my heart strings. Safe Haven was an amazing book and I couldn't put it down. Finished it in 2 days (:
0446554995|3.0|**Spoilers**<br />Lincoln Preston's latest Pendergast outing, Two Graves, (like the preceding two in this trilogy) somewhat diminishes the mystique and cleverness of my all time favourite character. The ending of the last instalment where poor decision-making and a lack of Pendergast's expected hyper-vigilance result in his long-lost wife's abduction from the park, should have alerted to the ongoing potential for disappointment. The Pendergast of old would never have been so unprepared and guileless.<br /><br />There are several glaring issues with this unfolding final story that obviously do not highlight Special Agent Pendergast's preternatural abilities to their very best, instead demanding an extraordinary level of suspension of disbelief and reader commitment. Usually, Pendergast relies on the application of a huge skill-set, intelligence and some very talented allies, as well as the ever-loyal Vinnie. But this time it is a matter of brute force and all-guns blazing to the extent of ridiculousness -- even Pendergast could not make an accurate shot from a speeding motor-bike, not to mention Vinnie's easy betrayal which disregards the bond of almost every past shared incidence. The convenient volcano, evil Nazi scientists reminiscent of 'Boys from Brazil', a serial killer son with a saintly twin and not one, but two, fairly irrelevant, ill-conceived sub-plots involving Corrie and Constance dilute the interest.<br /><br />Two Graves remains a fast, gung-ho read, but it suffers from Pendergast's spectacular fall-from-grace, which is simply too uncharacteristic of the relentless hero the reader has come to know and love. Here's hoping future outings return Pendergast to the realistically infallible, brilliant and fascinatingly refined protagonist we've been led to expect without fail.
B008G59IBI|4.0|Tre is what most have come to expect from Green Day...thankfully kind of makes you forget about the CD Uno~
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great movies in great quality. It came with a small booklet with behind the scenes photos. The box is nice and looks good too.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|I bought this movie because I loved how cheesy it was! The shipping was amazing...even with the holidays it still came pretty quickly (4 days, normal shipping). The movie was SUPER cheap, and is in perfectly working condition. It plays just as a newly bought DVD.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly grabs your attention right off the bat and keeps you turning pages.  I am eagerly awaiting his next book.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|daughter enjoys this movie. great inspiration for children. love that there's no message about marrying a charming prince is the best thing in the world.
1118232658|5.0|Unless you've been living under a rock you've noticed the way social media has impacted our every day lives. This book is a guide to understand this new era. It's a must read for anyone who is trying to succeed and breakthrough in today's fast paced world.
0307950689|5.0|I bought this because I am interested in Freemasony and I like his other books. This is a great read. I can't help but picture Tom Hanks as the character. I hope they make this one into a movie too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Greatest book I've ever read! Cannot wait to see the movie! Nicholas Sparks done a great job with this exciting love story!

B007HACDLK|5.0|There are only a couple writers who get a 5 star rating from me. Vince Flynn is one of them. I thoroughly enjoy the fast pace and twists he engineers into the plot.<br />Highly recommended to anyone who likes spy stories.<br />Outstanding.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The makers did a fantastic job cleaning these old movies up for bluray, and the packaging is fantastic for this collection.

B002ZG9968|4.0|Great movie for those who love Jennifer Lopez, just mesmerizing. Was sort of slow moving at first, but, you can get 'caught up' in the plot.
1845767055|5.0|The inventiveness of the creatures in the book the amount of detail in the execution of the original paintings and sketches are stunning. The amount of detail is amazing and the compositions are dynamic and well laid out. The production values of the book publisher are very good. A quality publication all in all.

B000NVL1XQ|3.0|I bought this movie in a hurry on a amazon and for some reason did't think much on the HDDVD part of it, until I got the movie and it doesn't work with my PS3.
1402786360|4.0|If you're looking for something easy to do, this isn't it. But it IS a beautiful book to keep on your coffee table (or in the bathroom!) to just flip through and admire. I've even come up with more than a few ideas based on the gorgeous photography!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game to challenge the mind, but also very addicting.....hard to put it down...just want to keep playing one more game.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I am a huge fan of minecraft, and its great to make it portable, but I'm having problems. First of all, I can build stuff on a world, but once I go back to the title screen, then go back to my world, it's all gone. Second, if I want to delete a world, it won't let me. This is only true for Kindle Fire, because I have it for iPhone, and it works perfectly.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|[[ASIN:B00AAQRNQ8 Anker High Precision Laser Gaming Mouse with 8000 DPI, 9 Programmable Buttons, Weight Tuning Cartridge, Omron Micro Switches]]<br /><br />Really enjoying it, works great, love the customization, the feel and especially the price, a similar model by another company would cost $30-$50 more.  My only issues are it's a bit light even with all the weight in, and it feels a bit hollow making it seem like it's made of a cheaper plastic, if the plastic itself were a bit thicker on the inside I think that would fix both issues.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was honestly disappointed when I started reading this book because it seemed to be simply a high school romance which is entirely not my preferred genre. However, after giving the book the benefit of the doubt I was proven very wrong. There are so many brilliantly unpredictable twists that were executed perfectly. It was a great read that approached very real life struggles.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I loved how Ms. Austen created a world about proper society and the turmoil of lost love collide into one. The book is far better than the movie.
B004RE29WW|4.0|For some reason alot of people hate this movie. I know<br />that the first version didn't make much sense, but the the<br />special edition does.Still a good movie though.

B00APUQT7I|5.0|My family has been a fan of the Ice Age saga from the beginning, and this latest installment kept us laughing.  Most sequels, even cartoons, lose some of their &#34;oomph&#34;, but Continental Drift maintained the humor (though sometime subtle) that we came to know and love from the first movie.  This movie is great for young and old alike!
B007ZZKXWS|3.0|I can't get this damn DVD to play on other than a computer PC! I don't care how much of a cult classic it has become, what is the point If I can't enjoy the movie in my living room?

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|.....SPOILERS.....<br />This was a surprisingly fun game.  I got this game for my kindle fire and it played flawlessly.  I do warn you it is slow to download but that seems to be a normal thing with g5 games.  The hidden object games are pretty simple and not to much of a challenge but I had fun trying to do them as fast as I could but if HOG games are not your thing you can trade the HOG game for a card matching game instead and get the same result.  If you are sharing your games with a child that is easily spooked this is not the game for them because they did very well making some scenes very creepy.  Now for the spoilers, one thing they did to make their HOG games harder for example in one I had to find a mustache and I found a picture of a man with a mustache and when I clicked on it it didn't register.  At first I thought the game was glitching and was frustrated thinking I would not get to finish the game but found a mustache just lying on another shelf.  I recommend trying the free trial first it gives you a real taste of the game, I thought you got to play a long time before they stop you and ask for money.  I payed $2.99 and thought the game was well worth it.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|It works for the kindle fire just fine but....<br />Not compatible for the new kindle fire HD very frustrating as I have tried many times to uninstall and reinstall

I usually take 3 listens to a new CD before rendering judgement and rarely give a 5 star rating.  This was easily a 4 star on my first listen and by the 3rd it was a 5 star.  The only other CD I can compare it to in recent stuff I've tried, in terms of quality and likeable (to me at least) was Arena's latest, Seventh Degree of Separation.  I'm not comparing styles, just awesomeness.  I'm becoming a huge Damian Wilson fan and he is incredible in MoP.  Fantastic emotion and melodies that build, and high energy upbeat material for the most part.  Highly recommended if you're tired of the radio drivel.
1451688091|5.0|Doris Kerns Goodwin is a national treasure.  She has increased our understand about American Presidents.  I already owned this book in hard cover. I bought the book as a gift.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Great product, holds well and easy to use!!!<br />this chest rig holds 6 rifle mags and 6 handgun mags!!<br />Fully adjustable and great stitching!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is as good as Hunger Games. I couldn't wait to get to the next page. I was completely captivated by the events of taking place to the folk of District 12. Excitement, drama and mystery await you in every page.
B003CW67TQ|4.0|Another great read! A definite page turner! Harry Hole make you believe in under dogs! Just when you figure out who did it the Snowman kills your guy!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a fast paced book about a personal struggle to overcome significant adversity. That story alone is worth reading but when you add in that as Adam Brown fought this battle, he also fought to become one of the most exemplary members of our Tier 1, Seal Team Six, his accomplishments are truly inspiring.  Not only for his actions in his military life but more for how his personal life allowed him to handle that action and mentor others on how to do so.<br />This book is a far cry from the chest beating, self promoting &#34;Seal&#34; books that currently flood the market.  Anyone would appreciate and be motivated by it.
0765325950|5.0|I, like many, did not like the idea of having to purchase the hardcover when all of the rest of the books are in ebook format.  It is what it is though.  Yes, I did purchase the book hardcover to finish the story, and yes, I will be buying it again when it comes out in ebook format, and am not very please about that, but my feelings on the matter in no way have anything to do about the quality of the writing.  The book was action packed from cover to cover, and I could not put it down.  There were many surprises.  I have recommended and would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the series.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|What can I say? This movie was a great glimpse into the life of Lady Thatcher. Meryl Streep did a brilliant job bringing her to life on the big screen! No wonder why she won awards for her performance. Highly recommend this movie to ANYONE who has a slight interest in British government/history.
1608871088|5.0|Loved the book fully. The concept that was revealed behind each character's design, the process in which it took, and how each character grew, was simply fantastic. A great read and the artwork is breathtaking.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game but I don't love it. I really do enjoy the city type games and stuff and I like this one.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|There aren't many films that raise goosebumps anymore -- this one absolutely does.  I'm deliberately not going to give specific details about the film because you will appreciate having it unfold for you without any advance knowledge.  Suffice it to say: The script, the cinematography, the choice of actors and their acting skills could not have been better.<br /><br />\\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\" is not just a sensational film, it's a great lesson about life.  Don't miss this one!<br /><br />(submitted by John's wife)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you liked Marley and Me, you will certainly enjoy this book.  The dog tells you what he thinks of humans.  It will make a better human out of it and you will definitely look at your dog in a new light.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very fun. Hard to advance without spending money though. Fun . Way to pass the time. Wish I could get more items
1401322786|4.0|\\"The Time Keeper\\" is a quick and easy read that leaves the reader with a new perspective on time.<br /><br />Do you really think you want to live forever?  Read this book.  Or are life's troubles getting you down so badly that you want to check out?  Read this book.  My takeaway is that time is precious and we only get what we get.  Life is a journey, so make the most of it.<br /><br />Mitch Albom excels both as a sports reporter and as an author.  He also appears to be a wonderful human being. His talents and his insights are on full display in this as well as his other books.

B008G8SFGO|3.0|Still mad at Kiss (Gene and Paul) for treating Peter and Ace they way they did.  CD ok, but not like Kiss as we remember.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book but can't imagine how they were able to condense it enough to make a movie out of it. It was a wonderful trip to another place and time. It made me marvel at the author's imagination.

Top Videos, Worldwide, Exclusive, Bonds, Commodities, Emerging Markets, Funds, Stocks and so many more to choose from. With just the tap of the setup button you can choose which categories to see in the News section, as well as easily dragging them into which position you want them.<br /><br />Refreshing the information is as fast as touching the refresh symbol, in the upper left corner of the screen.<br /><br />Want to see Markets or find a stock, then just click on the tab near the bottom of the screen. You get to choose from: News, Markets, My Stocks, Stock Finder and About ( which is also where to go for questions, feedback, and to check for updates ).<br /><br />Under the Markets tab you will find: Equity Indices, Movers, Commodities, Bonds, Currencies,  and Futures.<br /><br />Under the My Stocks tab you will find: last change, value, position, bought at, P&amp;L, Today, with tabs for Chart, Earnings, and News. The Chart tab has normal options to choose from ( 1 day, 1 month, 6 month, etc. )<br /><br />You can add stocks from either the My Stocks tab (touch the setup symbol in the upper right corner) or under the Stock Finder tab. Here you can add position, purchase price, etc.  You can also manually order your stock list (more about this in The Bad... section below).<br /><br />All in all I have to say this is a great application, it just could be tweaked to be better.<br /><br />The Bad...<br /><br />As I said in beginning I have been using the BlackBerry version of this app for over a year.

For instance, say you have or are watching AT&amp;T, you have to remember that the ticker is T:US.

B008GOAFBQ|3.0|Nothing new to hear on this CD.  If you already have Destroyer in your collection, no need to purchased this CD.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it to all my friends. It is well written and poignant. If I had a dog I would have given him a great big hug.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|fun app, wish there were more background options tho. other than that quite fun to play and easy to use and understand.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I removed the product out of the sealed box and plugged it into the PS3 per the instructions.  I watched Netflix for approximately 15 minutes and suddenly the right speaker went out.  I attribute this failure to poor build quality and wire failure.  While the headset sounded good, I have serious concerns as to whether this product would last beyond a single year.  Oh Turtle Beach... how far you have fallen since your zenith in the 90's.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|This is a great story of the French resistance just prior to D-day.  The author was able to weave a true story of sabotage around the personal lives of British intelligence agents and the French resistance. Included are the German counter-intelligence agents who are portrayed in a very complex manor. Men who like to torture people and then felt sorry that they had to do this to do their jobs. To clarify, they felt sorry for themselves not their victims. The author makes no mistakes that these are very sick men. If you like Ken Follet then you will really enjoy Jackdaws as it brings the British intelligence service to life.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|While I've read other books by Victor Hugo the length of Les Miserables has kept me away from it. However the Broadway production and now the movie have told me it's time to read it. The play brought wonderful music to the story; the movie helped me understand the plot better; the book brings rich character descriptions and Hugo's wonderful phraseology of his philosophy. This book is long past copyright laws so there are numerous copies available for free. Although it's still awfully long, I highly recommend it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is<br /> the best book  you can ever read.The first day I got it I finished it because it had me at the edge of my seat and I couldn't stop because it was so funny. Can't wait for the next book!
B0090EHVMC|2.0|The political message was way too thick.  I lost patience with the message and got bored with the movie.  My kids enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I will watch it again (not that I finished it the first time).

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was an engaging, disturbing and, ultimately, understandable story of parental love and their inability to recognize their son's flaws.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This he is amazing for those who enjoy farm games. It teaches responsibility and is a lot of fun. It never freezes and has great quality!
B00A3CVFMM|4.0|It is a soundtrack, do the flow of music is for a movie rather than listening, but I really enjoy it as background music.
B00A27NN50|5.0|My girlfriend suggested this film after watching another Wood Allen flick last week. Great movie! The Amazon service makes it easy also.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Pretty good take on a classic film. The sounds were amazing! Some of the scenes seems to move so fast it was a blur, but other than that it was quite a ride!
B009VB97EY|1.0|I can't believe Matthew McConaughey reduced himself to playing in this movie.  It's garbage and a waste of time and money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not expecting what this book was going to teach me. I date a lot of christian Grey's. Roads  that I read this book to realize  it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|For any Sam and Dean fan, this is a necessary item in your cart! This season somehow managed to get even more intense than the last!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. It actually makes you feel like you're raising a horse. I can't count how many times I actually cheered out loud, &quot;Good job, Beauty!&quot; If you have any love for any member of the Kingdom Animalia, you need to play this game. Also, it's more fun if you spend $99 on gems like I did.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Very good reading. Definitely 5 star. Captivated the whole way to the last page.  Cannot wait to start the next book
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This was one of my favorite reads as a pre-teen so I was eager to read it again 50 years later.  What I learned was how differently I understood the story.  As a young person, I enjoyed the premise and the supernatural aspect of the subject.  Wouldn't that be cool sort of thing.  But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect.  I wish I had appreciated more of that as a young person; it probably would have helped me avoid some of the pitfalls of growing up.  A provocative read for all ages.
0385737955|5.0|Every aspect of The Maze Runner is amazing. The book has a lot of suspense and action. Also, great characters too. 5/5 Stars!!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Of course my 9 year old is a fan of this band, but it's also fun for me to listen to. We enjoy singing and dancing to these guys while we're cooking together or cleaning the house.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a great little app for my Kindle Fire HD! I needed it to download my ebooks for my college courses & it works just fine. I wouldn't have been able to take advantage of its portability without this app. Highly recommend!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter has learner a lot about horses by playing this game. she likes it alot<br />it helps her to learn responsibility too.
B0086700CM|5.0|A simple yet fun game to play for the whole family.  My 10 year old cousin introduced the game to me, and it only took mere minutes to get me and my husband hooked.  It's great for all ages!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book provided so much to THiNK about.  The what ifs and the<br />whole idea of the butterfly effect was so interesting.  The beginning took<br />me in and I didn't want to put it down.  The middle got a little slow but it<br />was WELL worth the wait.  Had never read Stephen King before and I'm<br />so glad I chose the book!
B008R14YBK|5.0|Great CD not only for kids but adults too.  She has a great voice and it is totally worth purchase!!  It is played over and over agian at my home.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I had much higher hopes this one. it was OK. The effects were really bad in places and the time travel logic was sketchy and weird. It would have been forgiven had it moved along faster and not given so much time to think about it.<br /><br />Anyone remember 13 Monkeys? Bruce Willis goes back in time and sees himself as a kid.....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a cute and fun game. cant wait to show it to my little sister, she is going to love it. it kinda reminds me of a game at Dave and Busters.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|A fantastic buy for the HP fan.  It was exactly what I wanted at a price I could truly afford.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Ron Pearlman, Katie Segal, Charlie Hunnam and more twists and turns than a sidewinders' trail.  It doesn't get any better than this for a recent series, period!
0679805273|1.0|I choose a 1 for this rating because the book came very damaged and unable to use it.  The book itself is actually a great book, just who ever shipped it did a horrible job and I was very upset about the shape it was in new!!
0525478817|5.0|From all the hype, I thought I would fall in love with John Green through this novel like everyone else. It gripped me throughout and to be completely honest, have never gotten to the point of uncontrollable tears that begin to fall onto my book. If you're an overly sensitive type, this book may be 336 pages of torture, but it's definitely worth it.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I really enjoyed the thrill of this movie. The twist at the end is good but not as unexpected as others made it seem it was goin to be.
B008KE3960|3.0|No matter how hard I tried, I could never get the hang of this game.  My husband downloaded it, but he didn't find it very interesting, and gave it up quickly.  Maybe someone else will have better luck than us!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As the saga of Downton Abbey continues viewers are given a peek into lives of a different time and place. It is impossible not to be caught up in the drama.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Ted was a funny movie with likable characters.  Keep in mind, it's sophomoric humor, but it's still funny.  It was worth a rental.
0142410705|5.0|After reading TFIOS, I thought I should dive into another one of John Green's works. This one was a beautiful one. The resolution won my heart, and I definitely recommend this novel to all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. my 9 year old plays it non stop. its very entertaining and very realistic. wish gems were easier to earn though.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie is not funny at all. I wanted to watch a movie that would make me laugh, but instead I am just annoyed at this movies stupidity.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|First of all, my only disappointment was how quickly I read this book!  There are many books out there that are difficult to read, to understand. Not this one, it flowed from the first few pages I read on the book description's look inside feature, after that brief glimpse, I knew I would enjoy this book.  To those who gave this book less than 3 stars, shame on you, you must have left your sense of fun and adventure behind somewhere.  Lighten up!  This is fun fresh fantasy, not To Kill a Mockingbird, for cryin out loud!  I found it a refreshing break from the usual bodice ripping throat slashing angst ridden books I usually read.  I found the characters believable and enjoyable, and would love to have visited this bookstore.  I try to frequent non-corporate owned bookstores when I can, and next to give my dollars to brick and mortar stores...I still miss Borders!  But, as is pointed out in this book, time marches on and times change, and I did read this on my iPad, after purchasing the  Kindle edition on Amazon.  I use Google search engines and other Google technology, this was a fun read in the sense it gave me a glimpse into the Google corporate world.  Interesting, to say the least.  Buy this book.  At the very least you will learn about typesetting!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the books.  The first one was great and now I cannot put this one down.  Non-stop from the start.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and really loved it. Bought it over the holidays as a gift for a friend. Was pleased with the fast shipping.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but it is very similar to 50Shades of Grey which I really enjoyed. It' s possible that if I had read this series first, that I would feel the same way about the 50 Shades series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The procurement was easy, the delivery was rapid, and the content of the video as expected.  The experience needed no improvement.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was so taken aback after watching season 1. It was such a change, but oh wow, what a change. The depth and multiple storylines coming together was just genuis.  I'd just read a series called &#34;Asylum&#34; by Amy Cross that had some of the same ideas and wondered if they were related somehow.  I have been so surprised that AHS Season 1 and 2 would be let out on Television, but why not I guess. Loved it, Loved It...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because I liked the book. I recommend this book to teenagers because they would understand the the stuff that happens in the book.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|Got this for my grand kids. Didn't know if they would like it or not but kids from ages 4-8 love it. Keeps them occupied for quite some time. No crayons on the floor.
0385342055|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but have read all the others in the Shopaholic series, so I'm sure I will love this one too!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Although not entirely thought provoking and pretty predictable, this book was a light hearted and fun read to relax from the stressers of everyday life. A romance story we can all hope for.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a really good and fun game. I think its a good game for all ages even adults. you get to &quot;connect&quot; with the pony's.

B008J05EL8|3.0|You would think Amazon would give this to you for free since they give you the office suite with your Kindle. Not impressed with that Executive decision.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE PURCHASED IT TOO. MAKES USING THE PHONE IN THE VEHICLE VERY SAFE WITH HANDSFREE.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app so much! i love horses and many other animals! this is a great app for anyone who can read. ;)
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Disc 2 has music from the movies. It is fun to listen to and try to guess where in the movie the music is from.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I thought this book was really creepy and haunting. It was incredible, though, even though the style of writing could get a little boring at times, with its long descriptions. The lengthy descriptions were really the only things I disliked about the book. I would not read this book if you have a short attention span- I found that if I skipped a part I found boring, I would miss something important, and have to go for it later.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So many translations. Love the plans and reminders. Easier to read than other apps and this one makes it your own. Love it very much must download!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the books that I actually love.  It's written with a lot of teenager problems as well as perks, and it is one of my very favorite books.  It's the kind of book that you pick up with little interest but once you start reading you can't put down.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages.  Grandchildren like it as much as I do. I hope to see more of these types of Angry Birds' games coming.
B009FBX5M0|4.0|This is nice but it does not have the movie theme song on it. That's why the lower rating. The single has to be purchase seperately.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish that mojang would add more stuff but other than that it is awesome!!! Minecraft.is a sandbox game of imagination. Partly why I love it !!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best book I've ever read. Really changed my perspective on life, death, and the feeling and meaning of true love.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This was tremendous fun to build and lots of kids from ages 5 to 14 helped to build over a long weekend. Highly recommended.

B0080K3G4O|2.0|I've never been impressed by \\"Power of Positive Thinking\\" nonsense.  So this seemed like my kind of book. And at first, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />But as I kept reading, I started getting more and more depressed. I may not buy into \\"think positively & achieve everything you want!\\" - but that doesn't mean I was ready to accept \\"don't dream, don't strive, don't think, don't believe, because you're unimportant, your individual existence is meaningless, and once you die it will be as if you never existed at all.\\"<br /><br />I can't judge anything after that, because I had to put it down or risk slitting my wrists.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love stories that make me laugh and then make me cry. This book is so sharply witty, LOL funny and achingly sad...I loved every bit of it! The 2 teenagers (Hazel Grace and Augustus) in this story belong in the same category as Juno (from the movie \\"Juno\\"), smart,  precocious, and so funny. I will definitely read more of John Green's work!
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this every day and love it!  Can't live without it in my classroom it has become a great tool in increasing the vocabulary of my students.
B007DIQAXI|4.0|This is a great album, and I don't mind changing the record, but I don't know why it wasn't just put on one record. The album isn't long enough to justify this. It's kind of annoying to have to change records after 12 minutes...Awesome band though and the vinyl sounds great! Don't let my nitpicks stop you from picking up a solid record.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is totally awesome  once you start it you won't beable to put it down.  I love this game.  I can't to see how thet will try to beat this game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good book! Wasn't sure about series at first, thought it was just a \\"hype\\" ,but it has lived up to the hype! Looking forward to book three!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Poor special effects. Suspenseful but sometimes characters act unreal. Otherwise, a good show.<br />And here are the other seven words.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|The description for this novel is quite misleading, I only bought it on impulse because it has been receiving so many positive reviews. I'd suggest most adults get a sample before they buy, because I was pretty surprised to find the heroine of the novel to be a 17 year old girl. That doesn't automatically make it YA fiction, but the tone and story-line firmly places it in that territory. Although I was a little annoyed that 'Hopeless' wasn't what I expected, I've read plenty of YA fiction that I thought was really sophisticated and interesting, so I thought I would give it a go. That was a mistake.<br /><br />This is clumsily written, over-wrought, badly edited (if it's been edited at all... I'm doubtful) and it gives a bad name to other incredibly talented YA writers. I looked at the author's page and apparently a couple of her other novels have been optioned for films. I can only conclude that 'Twilight' has clearly set a terrible precedent. That said, I've read 'Twilight', and as unbelievable as it may sound, 'Hopeless' was worse than that abomination.<br /><br />The whole novel is written in a very odd version of a first-person, present-tense narration that grates on the nerves because there's no rhythm or lyricism. Even the worst pulp fiction writers have a handle on voice, but the narration in this has a relentless, almost robotic quality.<br /><br />The fact that I've written a comprehensible review for this novel gives it far more respect than it deserves, but I really felt like there needed to be more dissenting voices in the reviews, and as many warnings as possible to adults who like to read books that are well-written to stay away! 'Hopeless' doesn't even have the distinction of being fun, so there is really no incentive to sit through the droning writing style of Hoover.<br /><br />Final Warning: There is no indication this book has been edited by anyone, not even the author herself.
0739337297|5.0|This book had everything. It was humorous, wildly entertaining, suspenseful and thought provoking, even at a spiritual level. I think the last books I enjoyed this much were The Secret Life of Bees and The Help. The characters were so well developed that I felt like I knew each of them, even the dog! My husband enjoyed it as much I did too.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Like many newcomers to this band, my first exposure to them was the excellent \\"Genuine Negro Jig\\" album. Wow! This latest release is more of the same ... which I think is a good thing. Another thrilling, nearly flawless display of good old time string band music, but with a slight modern twist from the Carolina Chocolate Drops. In other words, they aren't shy about wearing their musical influences on their sleeves, but the sound isn't some stale retro rehash. This is music that bursts with joy and vitality. This type of music obviously isn't for everyone: I doubt, for example, it's going to be a favorite at frat parties (but hey, prove me wrong!). But for those with an open mind and an appreciation for musicians who are skilled at what they do, and passionate about the music-making process, this album makes for a most enjoyable listening experience.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is better than season 2!!!  I, as so many other viewers, could not STAND Lori character, but I cried when she was dying!!  Rick, who has been holding it together so well, snapped for a while, but who wouldn't under the circumstances.  This is definitely more than just another zombie show/movie!  The character development is wonderful, superb writing and acting!  I LOVE this series!!!!  Can't wait til season 4 in a few weeks!!!!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I've been playing this game for quite some while.  It's not the best time-waster since it's more of a waiting-game (har har) but it doesn't force you to spend money to enjoy it for the long-haul.  I would like more accomplishments or special events, but that's up to the developer.  Played on HTC-Andro and Kindle
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So refreshing to view a show with real talent, that is so captivating and entertaining, that doesn't rely on car-smashes, shooting people or drug-abuse.  This is what enjoyable entertainment is all about.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is one of the best Batman movies ever; I have the other two and this one is great. Keeps you interested all throught with a twist at the end!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I use this app fairly often and it works just great - never had a problem.  Wish I had it long ago.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Maybe im too old... i got this simply because i had heard it was a great book and also i wanted to watch the movie but read it first. I dont get it. I honestly was going to stop reading it but got bored and decided to finish it. Honestly the 2nd half of the book is way better and more interesting unfortunately you have to read 59% of boring nothing to get to it!
B0094KTCUQ|4.0|This works really well on my ps3 and ipad. I would really like to use this on Android though. I went with amazon instant video to find a cross platform service so I only have to buy a movie once and I can watch it any way I want.<br /><br />Movie is wonderful and the steaming service on ps3 worked flawlessly.
B002YFL1ZC|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my in-laws a month before Mrs Houston's passing everyone loved this soundtrak so much now, the children know most of the songs by heart...what a delightful piece of history we have. Thanks!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|it's got a different twist from Sigh no more, but still the great lyrics and voices. can't wait until next album!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is very interesting and I can't wait to read the next one!  It is very suspenseful.  It is awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B004ADB17Y|5.0|This is one of those movies from my childhood that left a huge impression on me. I can even repeat the lines from the movie by heart because I've watched it so many times. Even as an adult, I can watch this movie over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is great it teaches you how to take care of a horse like feeding it cleaning it and cleaning its stall
B005R32L66|1.0|We have 2 [[ASIN:B007M506WS Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (32GB, Deep Grey)]]  I downloaded Skype onto 1 of the tablets and was able to see the person who was calling but they could not see me. I putzed with it for days, even tried reinstalling it but it just never worked right.<br /><br />I deleted it and looked on the google play store and their version was different. Downloaded it from them and it worked right off the bat.<br /><br />Not sure what happened maybe Amazon has an older version?<br /><br />The other problem I've been running into lately is with Amazon trying to install an app you buy on several devices is difficult.<br /><br />For instance with this app when I tried to download it onto the second tablet the amazon app kept saying i already had it and to find the app on my device yet it wasn't there nor was it listed in my cloud apps? not sure about that I'm going to email them and see whats going on.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game on my phone. So I put it on my Kindle and can't use it without internet access. That I don't like and did'nt know that.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|Although the product says all regions, it's 50hz and only plays in Europe.  Don't buy this, it doesn't play at all.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|For those who wish to convert their manuscript to the Kindle format, this is the road map necessary to achieve a professional product.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|One word sums both part 1 and part 2....WOW. Absolutely amazing! I am looking forward to more! Also, great soundtrack!
0307276902|5.0|This is the first book I have read by James Frey and I have been addicted to his stories since the first paragraph. I'm a girlie girl. I absolutely hate drugs and violence but couldn't put this book down. I was extremely relieved to hear it was fiction, that doesn't change the fact that its a good book.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch. It keeps you thinking in a pretzel logic sort of way about time travel. The movie moves along at a great pace as well, 2 hours seems like 15 minutes. The tone and atmosphere are also deep, dark, and brooding. I can highly recommend Looper.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|The first version of this cover was mis-manufactured so that when the lid is closed it does NOT turn the device off. That was corrected and the new version works well. When we ordered this cover for Christmas 2012 guess which one was sent? The old version. Nice way to get rid of a product that should have been recalled and trashed -- sell it to unsuspecting customers. Be aware that the old version is still being peddled and don't accept it. As for protecting the Kindle Fire, a cover like this is absolutely necessary. It is too good a product to damage because it accidentally dropped on the corner.
B009KYXEY6|3.0|I bought this for my daughter. I was a little disappointed because I was looking for the clean version. The cds in the store were all the ecplicit ones. So I checked online type in clean and since I did not see the warning I assumed it was the clean version. So I paid extra to get here in time for Christmas and it was the same as in stores. Other than my assuming it was clean it came on time. My daughter was happy.
0385342063|5.0|My favorite Sophie Kinsella novel so far. I was literally laughing out loud at parts. Don't miss this if you're a Sophie Kinsella fan!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Those of you who haven't watched this need to buy. It is a great family movie that we have always enjoyed.
0385523912|4.0|I found it very interesting and well wirtten and informative.  I understand much more about North Korea and South Korea now!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Let them talk - by Hugh Laurie.  Got this for a gift. My dad loves it!  House sings , it's great!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|...many other people seemed to like it, so....<br /><br />I wavered between \\"just okay\\" and \\"liked it\\", but in the end I never really warmed up to Connor (who my brain refuses to equate with the guy on the cover--that just isn't him, I'm sorry) and I still am not sure I buy into his redemption at the end, so...\\"just okay\\" wins. Furthermore, I wanted more \\"fun\\" and \\"flirty\\" as the new KISS line promises, and an opening scene in which the heroine is puking in a hotel toilet, in the midst of a prolonged bout of puking?--yeah, not so fun. Or flirty. It got better in parts, but then worse in other parts, leaving me with an ambivalent feeling toward the book as a whole. This was my first book by this author and the first I've read in Harlequin's new line; I'm definitely going to give both a second chance in the hopes that this one was just a one-off.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It works well. NIce cover. You can stand it up. A good cover for a Kindle Fire. The purple is a vibrant color.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|it comes with 3 individual blue rays which i absolutely love! great and cheap! i recommend this to the Austin Powers fans'
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Bought to replace VHS. Daughter was thrilled to have it replaced. It was in perfect shape and I was thrilled to get a great deal on it!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This movie will be a classic if not already.....Jodie are you half way out of the closet?....it does not matter still a great actress...
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I am so glad I didn't listen to the film critics who pooh-poohed this filmed version. I can't imagine anyone giving a better vocal and acting performance of Jean Valjean than Hugh does in this film. Everyone is great. Yes, Russell Crowe is a bit out of his element and there have been others who did this role more justice, but he isn't horrible as some film critics reported! I actually gleaned more meaning and nuance from this version than I have in the staged ones I have enjoyed.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as intense as the first two but books but equally thrilling with twists throughout. A good wrap up of all the characters.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Got a little technical in places, but loved the premise and the twists.  Like new ideas, and things that are thought provoking.
B005NFJAMG|5.0|This is one of those movies that offers a good adventure...only if our president would be so risk taker and gunho....
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for a friend of mine that is a big Star Wars fan.  He was very happy to receive it.
B005LAII1C|2.0|I'm no prude, but this movie really let me down. Never seen a movie with so many 4 letter words. About 1/2 was all i could take. I was raised with the teaching that people talk like that coz not smart enouph to find a better word. I'm a huge Mark Wahlberg fan. But this was uncalled for.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I loved it overall but felt like most of them were too easy.  Would have liked it better if it had gotten progressively harder with each level.  Love the game!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It has a way of pulling you in. I liked to read it mostly on my breaks at work. I would end up coming back from my break about 10minutes late because I couldn't get enough of it.
B008745B32|4.0|The characters were generally not likeable; however, it was a different time and place and the characters may have been typical of their time.  I wondered how the &#34;lower&#34; classes were surviving the war and the hardships.  I know that people who were considered &#34;upper&#34; class also suffered at that time.  Waugh was a product of his class and the times
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really great app<br />definately recommend it its better than cityville on facebook lol. the onlybthing its kinds hard to find how to add friends and visit them but overall a good applications
0375850864|5.0|I used this book also for summer reading program at the library.  The middle school kids really did like it.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|A wonderful story but I do feel readers should be very aware how emotional this story is. Some of the conversations between the characters showed maturity far beyond their years, but there again they had been forced into adulthood by their circumstances.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Totally awesome love it so cool you should get it it is worth that99&euro; llama llama llama Ian Flanagan llamamanian hi bye ha ha love you :&yen;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games are amazing and if you like fantasy/SiFi you should definitely try it  and once you've finished it you should definitely move on and read the rest in the series.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I really hated this book. I just wish i woud have realized it before i bought it. First off, i grew up near Carthage, Mo, the location most of the story took place. First off, they got the location horribly wrong. Carthage is about 3 hours away from the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, not right outsidd the door. Plus, they depicted Carthge as a run down hillbilly town, which is further from the truth. Carthage is a beautiful town with gorgeous houses and mansions. I hated that all the facts were wrong about Carthage. Next time, do your research on the town before you write aboug it. I won't even go into the horrible ending to this book. The story is long and not worth anyone's time.
B002RZZIXK|5.0|What an exceptional setting for this story.  The detailed description of the area made all the scenarios very interesting. A great drama.
B0099116AY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very well.  The stars were great in the picture.  It is good to see the mature peoples<br />view of life once in a while.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|So few of us remain untouched by the pain of watching someone we love - be it family or friend - struggle with addiction that I think anyone who watches this film will be able to relate. It is open and honest about the good and bad about love and the pain and fallout that comes with drug use. This is a powerful and personal emotional journey to go on.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Minus the excessive sex scenes in the book, I thought the story was beautiful. I wasn't mortified by how things played out (like I have been in other novels alike) and the ending was perfect and the way it should be. It was a true ending to a long and difficult journey.<br /><br />This book is a must read. Skip the sex if you will, but just reading the story of this book and the change in characters over time is so wonderful and fascinating. Now we just need to see ALL of Christian Grey's side of the story since he was so shut off... Maybe not 3 books worth though.<br /><br />Well done, E L James.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Great funny movie, took my grandson to the theater to see it and decided to put in his stocking for Christmas once it was out for purchase....Clinte Eastwood is hilarious......
0143038419|3.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is really funny in this book, especially the &#34;eat&#34; and &#34;love&#34; part. The &#34;pray&#34; part was a bit slow for me.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This games addicting. With all of the goals and fun stuff that you can purchase, this game goes on forever. I recommend this to any gamer and people who only play games for fun every once in a while. To those of considering, you won't be disappointed with this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you like angry Gran run u like subway surfers girls I suggest tricky and Lucy guys I suggest the one on the app
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love the graphics. lots of fun.entertains my 5 yr old.<br /><br />did have trouble reloadingame after coming out of it the first time? ??
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked the &quot; horror&quot; essence of this game and it does get you thinking more than other ones I've played. The puzzles are challenging and reminds me of other RPGs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps and ,just so you know, I have had probably +100 apps. This is the best horse app you can find and ITS FREE!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun way to waste time. Good graphics and its free! If you like horses then you will most likely love this game.
B008C40218|5.0|A Minnesotian whom loves Calexico, it brings me to the dusty roads and sandy beaches of the south border. This cd brings more Cal than Mexico, the proud horns are a little too absent but I suppose they have to change things up a big with each album. I love their music; Fortune Teller stood out for me on this album. Highly recommend with a corona or margarita :)
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is a lovely movie, will most definitely watch it over and over and over and over and over again!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game very real looking horse.  I like taking care of my horse great game for kids to learn how to take care of an animal. my grandson got me hooked on this game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first 90 percent of this novel is a unique mix of gripping thriller and marital drama; the final 5 to 10 percent falls flat on its face.  Was I expecting a &#34;Hollywood ending&#34;?  No, not really... but I was expecting some kind of meaningful closure, a resolution that doesn't simply leave the audience saying, &#34;oh, okay... that's bleak.&#34;
0385344333|3.0|This is another typical Jack Reacher mystery. If you liked the previous work by Lee Child then you might like this one. I call this type of book  \\"Airport Reading\\". Read it and pass on to someone else.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I have one for my but a different color now i have gotten this black one for the kids' i just bought and i havent been dissappointed.
B0010X745K|4.0|Loves all Stephen kings movies! My daughter got it for Christmas and working great! I've have purchase lots of movies from amazon almost all went to my daughter and grand daughter
B003TSEEDY|5.0|i love this book and im seeing the movie soon. i love the anonymous feel and oh my goodness its just overall great . Charlies vauge outline is so deep and amazing . 5 stars good jobbbb
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is such a cute movie and it is highly recommended!  My two year old loved it.  We must have watched it a hundred times!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Got this because my Grandson became obsessed with the Luigi's Mansion game. He loves it and it works very well.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|Brave:<br /><br />It was a terrible story.  Not beleivable at all.  the art work was good, but the music lost me.  If I was a kid I would not have liked it.
B004G600A4|5.0|The disk has no scratches, it didn't skip anything and plays perfectly. You can't ask for much more from a dvd.
B000002B2T|5.0|Simply the best album from the grunge era. Definitely a must for fans of Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I always enjoyed watching this when I was a little girl. When I was pregnant with my first child, I bought the CD to listen to and for my little girl to hopefully hear, since she would be born around Christmas. Now that she is one year old, she knows the music and she loves to watch the animation. It is so well done, and so calming, it is great before bedtime. I am just so glad that I can share this with her. My husband also likes it and doesn't find it annoying so the whole family can enjoy this. I would say it is great for little little ones because it isn't too long and will calm them for naps or bedtime :).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a awesome game especially if you love horses like me.You should get this app if want to have fun when your bord.
B00005JM02|5.0|I may have is-read the description, it is not one disk with the widescreen and fullscreen on it and another with special features, but each disk has the movie, and the bonus features in widescreen and fullscreen. Perfect for those movie lovers who love the movie so much they watch it til the disk burns out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome! Really the only thing I don't like about it is the jockey designs... But other than that I recommend this game!!!
0307592731|2.0|Could not get into this authors space, was unable to get past the first chapter, gave the book away and thats all.
0439023513|5.0|Bought all three in the sequence, couldn't put them down.  Read all of them within a week. You will love too
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down. It really grasps your attention. I was a late bloomer with this title. I read it after all the hype and then it was highly recommended to me by a very reliable source and I absolutely love it.
B008RYN44U|1.0|I can't say how disappointed I am in this.<br />The only reason I remembered to review it is because I was going to see if I can trade it in. Ya it's that bad.<br /><br />I think they are trying to make music to a fan base thats not the originaly fan base of ska/reggae. It's poppy/techno and totally not what I signed up for.<br /><br />I've been to every tour and gwen tour, if they go on tour with this albulm. I will not be in attendance. I should have listened to all the bad reviews but put it on my wishlist without much thought.<br /><br />As much as it pains me to say, I would only recommend this if you want your ears to bleed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Quick and easy way to pass the time. Who doesn't love Solitare? While I understand the need for ads in a free app, I wish the manner of getting out of them was consistent.
0439023491|5.0|Watched the movie loved the book. Great book, couldn't put it down.  I shared it with both my sisters and they loved too
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|great fun for my 3 yr old grandson and myself! We help each other and have a blast hunting animals!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|This DVD is great. Loved it the first time I watched it and had to buy it. A little different movie style for Matt Damon (suspense is present, just not as intense as Bourne Trilogy). Very Enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Romantic, sexual, surprising; what else can you want?! It was the best book I've read in a while and I can't wait to start the next one!
030758836X|3.0|This review is difficult to write without giving away those plot twists and turns that make the book worth reading and which the reader should discover for him/herself.  Nick and Amy are about to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary.  They have been experiencing some bumps in their marriage and while Nick is having an affair with a younger woman, Amy is planning a celebration designed to return them to a state of wedded bliss.  But before the celebration can begin, Amy disappears.  There are signs of a struggle in the house, Nick cannot account for his time that morning, and of course the police are looking at him as a prime suspect.  However, predictably, Nick swears he is innocent and is as puzzled as anyone by her disappearance.  So, if Nick didn't do it, who did?  Early in the book, by about page 50, you will figure out the \\"who\\".  It's the why and the how that remain a puzzle, with clues being slowly reeled out like a fishing line into the ocean.  This is not your run-of-the-mill \\"wife goes missing; foul play is suspected; husband seems the most likely suspect\\" tale, though it may seem that way at first.<br /><br />In most stories, there is at least one character to love, and at least one that we love to hate.  In this book, there are no truly lovable characters, but there is absolutely at least one very \\"hate-able\\" character.  Who it is, is for the reader to figure out ... trust me, it won't take you long.  The level of evil in this plot goes beyond anything most of us could even begin to imagine, let alone ever experience in our own lives.  Thankfully.  While the storyline keeps the reader riveted, it was not one of those books that I just couldn't put down until I had all the answers.  In fact, a few times I had to step away from it because the pure evil was just too much.  One character is completely devoid of a conscience, and the rest have not much more.  It was, to say the least, a disturbing read.<br /><br />Gone Girl has, as of this writing, spent31 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List, several of which have been in the number one spot.  Despite that, I can only give it a three-star rating.  My complaints:  the plot details were beyond believable, the two main characters were fairly well-drawn, but the supporting characters were all one-dimensional as cardboard cut-outs.  But the thing that really brought my opinion down was the ending which simply left me cold.  Whereas a really good book leaves the reader wanting more, wishing it would go on, this book leaves the reader thankful that it is over. Given the attention to detail and the presumption throughout the book that somehow justice would win in the end, the ending seemed almost as if the author was getting tired of writing and needed to meet a deadline so she came up with a lukewarm and highly disappointing ending to an otherwise adequate story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Throughly enjoy Kings writting. His imagination definitely takes some wierd turns. Would recommend any of his books to anyone that likes a touch of the bizzare.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This show is by far the best on TV today. No real big names in it (yet) but the quality of the work is fantastic. highly anticipating several more seasons on DVD as soon as they come out. Highly addicting show.
B000OIZUW6|3.0|The author has a tendency, wishfully,  to ascribe male inner and physical feelings to his female characters.  It is OK.  It isn't a top ten hit.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I love all their music I have watched this video several times. That's all I have to say.That's all I have to say.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|DON'T BUY THIS!<br /><br />This is the worst film I have ever seen.  I'm serious.<br /><br />Acting: Lame<br />Story: Lame<br />Characters: Lame<br />Movie: Lame<br /><br />I just watched this movie and I still don't know what the plot was.  Usually, superhero movies like Batman and Avengers keep me awake and excited.  This crap ACTUALLY put me to sleep!!!  NO JOKE!!!<br /><br />Please don't buy this movie.  It is utter garbage.  I did not enjoy one part of this movie except for one.  THE CREDITS!<br /><br />This is not only the worst movie of 2011 but the worst film I have ever seen in my whole life.  This is absolute crap.  Please please please don't buy this crap.  I've seen it once and I never want to see it again.<br /><br />I have proof that this film was a flop.<br /><br />Originally, the DVD cost $20, now $5.<br />Originally, the Blu-ray cost $30, now $10.<br /><br />There is proof right there about this utter garbage of a film.<br /><br />2011 had much better movies like POTC 4, Captain America and Thor.<br /><br />Don't buy this.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|The story about family and brothers, can only be described as wonderful. It is as touching as it is entertaining. It will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and torn between the characters.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very clear graphics.  Lots of interesting puzzles and neat hidden object challenges. Definitely worth the download. Can't wait to try some of their other games.  Love the quality
B005VT42BS|1.0|I don't know why I got this.  That's all I have to say. I am done writing about this. all done.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|you don't have to log into facebook as stated in other reviews. it automatically detects Internet TVs on the same wifi network. unfortunately my vizio Tv doesn't have support but the xbox and Sony Internet Dvd player do. it seamlessly streamed my videos on my tablet in great hd picture without interruption. I have hdmi out on my tablet but this app involves no wires and is great for tablets like the ipad which do not have hdmi out. I haven't look at all the various videos that come with the app but I could see myself watching suze orman or cnet  videos with it instead of on the Internet. one failure on its part is that if a video does stop midway the app restarts the video at the beginning.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I've used this quite often already.  I like having it on my Kindle where it is easy to read and the keypad is larger.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's a great challenge to both my son and myself. We have been at it for the past hour and we love it. I can see this being perfect for waiting rooms and it's all contained in one app.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|sorry just could not get in to this silly game. That's all I have to say about that. all done.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What else can you say? Finally Star Wars on Blu-Ray =)<br /><br />I waited for this for so long, it was a no-brainer.<br />Must-have for every fan. I would have liked a little bit more extras.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is relaxing and fun.  There are so many levels, I wonder if I'll get to them all.  Some of the patterns are really beautiful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Well I thought it would suck but it turned out to be alright. Some levels at a hard but most are pretty fun.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I got this apt because I sign back up to face book.  There is alot of stuff that won't work without Facebook.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I hate it.. Lol.. We are super addicted to this game!! The missions are obtainable .. some with a little work! Free gotta love free!!!!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I was not able to use this very much it is not easy to use. that is all I have to say.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|It could have been better. . . a few loose ends, and crative license with time of events....its time travel so it seems they didn't think explaining the sequences was important enough. Not too bad though.
B008458O3S|1.0|Not really what I was looking for. I downloaded this thinking it sounded fun, but had trouble with the download and then to find out it wasn't what I expected at all.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I loved the how a great of book it out. I didn't know that the book was so good by.
B004UID2LC|1.0|sorry that is all I I have Have To Say about about That I I am done writing about this
B009FZHYKU|3.0|If you like zombies that are inconsistent with their mobility this is for you. I don't particularly like how the<br />Writers take liberty with character inconsistency as well. Sometimes they make it 98% clear that a character<br />Is going to be eaten by zombies in a cage, but somehow miraculously  he shows up again to create havoc .<br />. . no explanation how he survived 12 zombies in a small room,… just that he comes back to create problems.<br />Characters personality constantly change,… story is getting a bit stagnant, and predictable. The writers claim<br />To fame is they don’t mind killing off anyone. Oh boy.
B004U8VWIM|3.0|I wanted to see this for a while. So, I broke down and rented it in HD.<br /><br />I was unimpressed with some of the CGI stuff. I really didn't expect such gimmickry. I think it would have been a stronger story with that stuff done in a less technical way. Like, how &#34;special effects&#34; were done in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. So, it's 3 stars from me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great for auy horse lover's out their.exspecailly for little kids. and grown ups too .you might have some problems but other than that its great
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I really like celtic music and like watching it on my large flat screen TV.  It is great music.  Thank you!!!
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|The story is interesting enough, if you can get by with the bad acting of Travolta. There are a few loose ends, and a cop out ending.
B0084HGZKK|5.0|Have only had time to listen to four of the CD's.  They are all good.  This music evokes feelings and could easily fit as motion picture soundtracks, much like those of Andre Previn, Bernard Herrmann and other great composers.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Always a fan of Jane Austen.<br />Though Pride and Prejudice may be considered her best work by some, Persuasion  is my favorite. Maybe it's the older heroine that makes it more relatable to me. Enjoy the journey through this book . It's not about getting to the end. It's a book that I've enjoyed reading again and again.
B008DM4OTA|1.0|Just purchased this for use on Nabi 2 android tablet. It is unusable as the scrolling doesn't work in the first part of the game. When you try to scroll it just returns you to another part of the screen every time. I will be requesting money back immediately

B005LAII80|5.0|Saw this in theater in 3D, it was a blast. Bought it on Bluray and it looks fantastic. The story isn't trying to be some huge developing plot, Dredd isn't saving the world, its just another day on the streets as a judge when a drug bust goes wrong. I remember seeing it opening weekend and there being almost no one in the theater. Its a shame that this movie didn't do well, because I would love to see a sequel of it. I guess it will just end up being one of those cult classics. Either way, its a great action movie with a simple, yet engaging plot, fast-paced action, and very surreal violence. My dark horse favorite of 2012.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Makes watching YouTube videos much easier.  Just search for the video you want and it gives you several options to watch.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I got this and really enjoyed it. Keeps you wondering what's going on?! A real attention grabbing puzzle game. If you like puzzle/tap and find games its for you.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This story gives an AUTHENTIC, sometimes graphic, but REAL accounting of some of the crazy battles our servicemen were in over in Iraq, and the job of this SEAL Sniper , and his Teams, to protect those guys.  Most people hear Sniper and think &#34;cold blooded killer&#34;, but this book explains the intensity of responsibility put on the shoulders of the SEAL Sniper and his Team to make sure all of the guys they are working with come back alive.  It also gives a REAL, firsthand, no sugar coating added, understanding of the mindset needed to stay alive in combat, and to keep everyone else alive.  You may hate parts of what you read, but the last chapter brings the whole book full circle.  I dont know about you, but I want Chris Kyle watching my six if in a battle.  Or any of his SEAL buddies.  Thank you for your service and dedication to the safety of our country Chris Kyle.  And thanks to your buddies who served with you, before you, and who continue to serve.  Your service makes me PROUD!!!!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|why did kindle put the camera in the fire hd if you have to pay to unlock it? shouldn't it have been free. any way the camera app works pretty good the picture quality is a little  pixaly. i give this app 4 out of 5 stars.

B001PJ3SBI|5.0|Words alone can not describe the elegance and beauty in this music. When I found myself listening to recordings of songs from this album online, I felt absolutely compelled to go out and buy the whole album. Few artists/bands do that for me but the simple vocals coupled with some of the greatest guitar playing in the world and thought-provoking lyrics make Knopfler's work some of my favorite. Knopfler proves yet again with Sailing to Philadelphia that his solo work has a firm place in the music industry, rivaling even his previous album, 'Golden Heart'. I can't seem to stop listening to Sailing to Philadelphia, Baloney Again, What It Is, and Prairie Wedding.<br /><br />Anyone that appreciates great music and guitar playing should buy this album.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my friend has had the iphone version for years and I'm glad the android version has come out. plays great on my kindle fire. fun and excellent for wasting time. don't have to spend real money unless you want to

B0097NGUJG|5.0|I first heard of this band by seeing a tiny desk concert they performed on National Public Radio. They hooked me right then and there. Their sound is so unique I have trouble trying to compare it to anything else I have heard. The vocals remind me vaguely of Jack White from the White Stripes but the sound is so oringinal I can't find anything else that even comes close. I find myself listening to this album over and over, never getting tired of it. It is musical art at its highest and I can't recommend it enough. Here is a web address to the tiny desk concert if you need more convincing to buy this album. [...]
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits is great drama. Each of the main characters is well developed and yet very different in their worldview and thus, the way they behave in certain situations.  Great show!

B003WUYRGI|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Even if it's a dictionary I would never read it all…… It was one of the most terrible books I have ever read... It had no modern words in it,<br /> so this book wasn't the kind if book I would want to do my vocabulary words with. Thank you Amazon for the most useless book in the world!!
0500515328|3.0|Just came back from a trip to Russia. The best way to see the<br />remaining crown jewels of the Romanovs. Some were gone or sold<br />during the early turbulent days of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />The Pictures are beautiful but errors abound in this book.
0307346617|5.0|If you're interested in this book, you're already inclined to be entertained by a story of the Zombiepocalypse. But even if you're not, this makes for truly interesting reading. The level of detail and inventiveness was truly surprising and satisfyingly entertaining. The vast number of sociological, cultural and historic effects of the Zombiepocalypse has been thought about from so many perspectives. I found it incredibly fresh to have been presented with so much forethought and thinking about a subject that we all think we've seen before. It makes the inventiveness of The Walking Dead seem like 2-dimensional thinking. The format of the storytelling was the most brilliant thing. It allowed the reader to take in the stories of people from all over the planet each with their own unique stories. To be honest, it was the trailer to the movie that made me want to read the book. But I can see how the movie is taking a different approach to telling the story of World War Z.
6305428050|5.0|I like going backl and watching this movie.  That's all I have to say. That's all I have to say.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I stopped eating wheat and all gluten-containing products 3 1/2 years ago and will NEVER go back.  Dr. Davis is 100% correct and I am living proof.  No more joint pain/arthritis, swollen gums, mouth ulcers, bloated tummy, anxiety, brain fog, etc....and the list goes on an on.  My body was one huge ball of inflammation.  Now I feel like the old me felt as a teen and kid - normal and GREAT!  I'm going to try to get my son to go wheat free to try and clear up his acne.  Hope it works!  For anyone out there who has similar symptoms they or their doctor can't explain I urge you to just try this way of eating for a few months.  You'll likely be pleasantly surprised.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|like the game but it cost to much real money to get far in game. they need to make gems easier to get and need to make it easier to invite friends. plus the game updated much sooner on google play store. have had an update on there for almost a month and still haven't gotten it on amazon. if they fix those things then it would be. a five star review easy.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is really good. It is a good deal sense it's free. I would have given it 5 stars but you can set it to alert you and it can get really annoying. Though you can always cancel it. I want to be notified  just  I just wish it would pop up with as message on the screen. I really like that when you pull down your notification bar (the one at the top) you can see the exact battery life number. And I also like to see the grid too. So it really is a good app. If you're looking for a battery app you should get this one. :)
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Loved this movie watched the at least 10 to 15 times.  That's all I have to say. That's all I have to say.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|For some reason we have several pieces of electronics that just love these batteries and when I bought them in our local stores I found prices that ran as high as $4.99 each compared to a much lower price for these.  If the $4.99 ones lasted 5 times longer they might be potential replacements; however, few places sell them as economically and as long lasting as Amazon.  I have been a Maxell fan for a few years and these batteries are an example of why.  They are shipped in multiple unit packages and have a decent shelf life but we seem to run out before the shelf life.  As Mac said:  I'll be back.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I played this game and introduced it to my grandchildren. They all loved playing and solving the mysteries. We played together several times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Great game, highly recommend.

1451696191|1.0|This book is completly overrated especially now with the movie coming out. The person (from USA today) who said this book was \\"in the tradition of Catcher and the rye and A Separate Peace\\" couldn't have been more wrong. This book is very stereotypical and is like every young adult book I've ever read.

B002ZG97EC|4.0|My family enjoys this movie. It is one we can all agree on together. From the grandparents to the grandkids, we all watch together.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Okay, it was good. I read it a couple of days - so it ticked that box. It became more interesting in the end as plot nuances tied up in a very neat bow.<br />I would have preferred slightly more description - but that's just me. I found the hungry pull the two love interests hold for each other intoxicating - but by more than half way if they were described as kissing one more time I was going to growl. If Holder held her face and ran his thumb along her jaw one more time....grrrr.<br />It was intense and erotic in a way that leaves Fifty Shades of Grey in the dust. A total love story. Two young people exploring each other with a deeper connection than the M.C can comprehend in the beginning. I had a strange sensation that there would be a sinister twist that would tear the two lovers apart; however, fortunately, Hopeless has a happy ending. Despite the tragedy hinted at in the title. The dialogue when used was great and very witty - I only wish my conversations with people were so charming. Adored the rude texts and the relationship between Sky and her Bestie. Though the story is a close up of her and Holder and all else completely fades. It was cool that Colleen Hoover didn't preach. I loved the lines about how every time he kissed her it would be like the first and how the M.C's virginity is savoured but not cherished and ultimately discarded as equally unimportant or less so than the first kiss. Because it was who she did it with that was important. The reasons for seemingly unimportant details is meticulously wrapped up, perhaps too deliberately which for me interfered with the beautiful flow but were well thought out. I maybe found it interesting that Sky didn't question herself earlier but I guess we deny what we cannot deal with. Wish there were more like Holder.
B005J9ZFQG|4.0|i love this movie for its humor i live it although the filming was alittle low budgit it had some good qualitys

0634049011|5.0|I've needed a book to 'put it all together' for a long time, and that's just what this is. Dull, boring and HIGHLY instructive. :) Much better than memorizing licks, and worth the effort it demands.

0316069434|5.0|I truly enoy the Harry Bosch noves.  He is definitely a great detective and is very intent on catching the bad guy.
B00821OUT6|5.0|This show is SPECTACULAR!  The show is excellent, lots of action and sci fi with great character development.  To accomplish this the shows pace during the first couple of episodes seems slower, but it deepens the characters and one can relate to their struggles.  I've seen the comparison to the Walking Dead before, and have to second it in terms of how good this show is and how strong the story is.  The story, the struggles and the enemy however are a different thing all together.  The enemy in this show is not a mindless hoard, it's a technologically advanced species looking to exterminate the humans. I don't say much else since it will fall into spoiler territory.  Watch this show, you'll thank yourself for it.  FYI, Season 2 is even better!
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|just not cutting it for me. Maybe for an artist that was not as huge as Whitney, Michael, Madonna, Janet, Tina etc. This could of been Arista's time to shine, but no they released a deluxe edition internationally & a single disc greatest hits in the US. This was the time to make something 100% better than the first Greatest Hits album that was released in 2000.<br /><br />First off, the sound quality of each song has been remastered, so that is a BIG plus for me. Now, we all know \\"You Give Good Love\\" was her first big break through single. Actually Whitney's first single is \\"Hold Me\\" with Teddy Pendergrass. The song was a #5 R&B Hit & #46 Pop Hit. This is the song that should of started the disc off. Her second single released from the debut album was \\"Thinking About You\\", but was a minor hit on the R&B charts at #10 and it still should of been included here. Now of course, we do recieve the 4 classic songs \\"You Give Good Love, Saving All My Love For You, How Will I Know, & Greatest Love Of All\\". It would of been nice to include the original piano version of \\"Greatest Love Of All\\". They also could of included her international single \\"All At Once\\", which was a Top 5 hit in Italy & also recieved heavy airplay in the US. The song was also included in the first Greatest Hits album.<br /><br />For the second album \\"Whitney!\\", we do recieve all of the classic songs (I Wanna Dance With Somebody, Didn't We Almost Have It All, So Emotional,& Where Do Broken Hearts Go?) in remastered form. The only single that was omitted was \\"Love Will Save The Day\\", but was included on the international deluxe edition. Also \\"I Know Him So Well\\" was another international single but did not have a major impact on the charts. Two other bonus tracks that would of been nice to include are \\"Just The Lonely Talking Again\\" & \\"Where You Are\\". The US edition does not recieve \\"One Moment In Time\\", but the international edition does? One Moment In Time was a #1 hit in the UK & #5 hit in the US, it should of been included here. Another bonus could of been to include \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\", which only recieved on the \\"I Will Always Love You\\" cd single in 1992.<br /><br />From the \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" album, the US version recieves the title cut & \\"All The Man I Need\\". The deluxe edition also recieves \\"My Name Is Not Susan\\" & \\"I Belong To You\\", which were both minor hits in the US. Am I the only person who noticed they did not include one of her most beautiful songs ever recorded titled \\"Miracle\\"? The song was a big hit in the US & should of been included here. Another single from the album was \\"We Didn't Know\\" with Stevie Wonder was a #20 hit on the US R&B Charts.<br /><br />MOST IMPORTANT, they did not include her version of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". Whitney is the only artist to chart this song into the Top 10 ever.<br /><br />They did include 3 singles from \\"The Bodyguard Soundtrack\\". We do recieve \\"I Will Always Love You, I'm Every Woman, & I Have Nothing\\". The deluxe edition also recieves \\"Run To You\\" & \\"Queen Of The Night\\". Both of those songs were minor hits in the US. As a bonus, it would of been nice to include \\"Jesus Loves Me\\" because it techinically was Whitney's last song she performed before her death. From the \\"Waiting to Exhale Soundtrack\\", we only recieve one track? They only give us \\"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\\", and the international deluxe edition also recieves \\"Count On Me\\" with CeCe Winans. They didn't even bother to include \\"Why Does It Hurt So Bad?\\", which is a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />From soundtrack for \\"The Preacher's Wife\\", the US recieves \\"I Believe In You & Me\\" and the international deluxe edition also recieves \\"Step By Step\\". The latter song was a big hit in the US & was also one of Whitney's favorite songs. There was also another single from the album, \\"My Heart Is Calling\\". It was a minor hit in the US, charting at #77 pop & #35 r&b. In my opinion, it should of still been included here.<br /><br />From her first studio album in 8 years, \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" the US edition only recieves the title cut. Are you serious? Where is \\"When You Believe\\", with Mariah Carey? Which was a major hit around the world, it was not included on either edition. The US edition does not include \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", which was a way bigger hit in the US than the UK but it was put on the international edition. \\"It's Not Right But It's Ok\\" & \\"I Learned From The Best\\" were not included on the US edition, but were included on the deluxe edition. Both were major hits in both markets. I'm not sure why they included \\"If I Told You That\\" with George Michael, which was not a major hit. In my opinion, I would of rather they include \\"Could I Have This Kiss Forever?\\" with Enrique Igleasis. Another bonus from the first Greatest Hits album would of been \\"Fine\\".<br /><br />It again slips here on both editions of the album. No songs were included from album \\"Just Whitney\\" or the holiday album \\"One Wish - The Holiday Album\\". I know \\"Just Whitney\\" did not have any break through singles, but \\"One Of Those Days\\" & \\"Try It On My Own\\" are two very underrated Whitney classic songs. Two other singles \\"Whatchulookinat\\" & \\"Love That Man\\" were minor hits, but no where to be found on either edition. She also had one single from the Christmas album titled \\"One Wish (For Christmas)\\", which was a Top 20 Adult Contemporary hit but again no where to be found.<br /><br />Then for her final studio album titled \\"I Look To You\\", we only recieve a newly remixed version of the title cut with R. Kelly. They did include \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" on the deluxe edition, which should of also been included here because it was Whitney's final song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 before her death. Another song that recieved heavy airplay was \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\", in which was a great inspirational song but again it was not included here. However, the only bonus we recieved was a called \\"Never Give Up\\". The song was recorded for the \\"I Look To You\\" album but did not make it to the final track list. They could of also included the duet with Akon titled \\"Like I Never Left\\". Also to note, there were also no songs included from the \\"Sparkle Soundtrack\\" either.<br /><br />On the positive note, I do love that all the songs here are remastered and the linear notes included in the booklet. I give the album 3 stars. Mainly because it's Whitney.<br /><br />Whitney Houston will always be one my favorite female vocalists of all time. Her untimely death was so shocking to me, just as the death of Michael Jackson shocked me. Two of the greatest artists of all time have now gone home to rest, but they have left behind some of the greatest recordings ever. God Bless You Whitney!

B0050SYS5A|4.0|I like this product because it allowed me to play my Kinect games in a smaller space,  the only issues I have is when trying to work the solely with hand motion to maneuver it bounce around the screen due the the fish lens on the zoom.  Other than that I recommend it.
B002ZG9968|5.0|LOVED this movie!  A good movie to watch as a movie night. We bought it as a gift for our son to create a movie night basket gift!
B009IA9OLE|4.0|The game is almost exactly what I thought it would be after watching the preview video and reading the description of it here. It's fun, silly, full of popular culture references that have some parodic humor to them, and it's an interesting challenge to fight different prosecutors and their teams, though not overly hard once you get the hang of what each type of character (their fighter &#34;class&#34; in a typical RPG) can do.<br /><br />That said, the art is really great, the dialogue strong, and the voice acting terrific. While there are three different paths to take (though you can manage two in one complete game), a heap of add-ons (you can usually only pick one of three), and three different ending scenarios, I think I mostly replayed the game for the dialogue between the main character and various prosecutors, who all have discernible personalities and traits, as well as for the art, which translates well to Kindle and to smartphone.<br /><br />Since you can save your progress in between cases, which are a minute or two long (with a minute or so of skippable dialogue beforehand), it makes for distraction when you want to play a game for only a few minutes at a time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was such a page turner. I won't say anything about it. You want to experience it for yourself.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|very good season but first season was definitely the best! Jessica Lange gives another powerful performance. The other characters from the first season are also excellent.
0307596885|4.0|Dear Life is my first experience with Alice Munro's fiction - but it will not be my last.<br /><br />Munro was born and raised on a \\"fox and poultry\\" farm in Ontario and she now lives in Clinton, a little town of approximately 3,000 residents about twenty miles from that farm.  Pure and simple, Munro is a short story writer - even her one novel, Lives of Girls and Women, is in the form of a group of interrelated short stories. Dear Life, the thirteenth original short story collection that she has published since her first in 1968, is her first since 2009's Too Much Happiness.  Interestingly, all of her stories seem to be set in the region of Canada in which Munro grew up and lives today.<br /><br />The stories in Dear Life are not so much plot driven, as they are character driven.  They feature strong, but complex, women whose lives are often changed or pushed in entirely new directions by spur of the moment decisions or chance encounters.  The reader is reminded that even what appear to be the simplest of lives are not ever so simple to the ones living them.<br /><br />Strong as the women of Dear Life are, when it comes to men, many of them seem to be attracted to the \\"bad boy\\" type - and they usually suffer the consequences.  One woman, married and the mother of a little girl, has a sudden fling with a younger man while on a train trip to Toronto to housesit for a friend; a middle-aged woman living alone on remote, broken down farm takes in a soldier who decides to jump off a train near her place; an elderly woman runs off when her husband's equally elderly old flame re-enters his life; and a rich woman has a long affair with a married man whom she figures out way too late.<br /><br />In addition, this fourteen-story collection include stories about little girls and one about a confused old woman akin to the kind of tale often found in the classic \\"Twilight Zone\\" television series.  The collection's final four stories are set in a separate unit of their own, and are described by the author as \\"autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact.\\"  These four stories are intriguing snapshots of incidents, one must suppose, that are based on something from Munro's own life, but rather surprisingly, they do not carry the emotional impact of the earlier stories.<br /><br />Dear Life is an excellent introduction to Alice Munro's fiction, to her unforgettable characters and the sheer power of her stories.  She is not a novelist but, somehow, her best stories read like mini-novels, and they say as much about the human condition as will be found in most full-length novels.<br /><br />Alice Munro is a true short story master.re described by the author as \\"autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact.\\"  These four stories are intriguing snapshots of incidents, one must suppose, that are based on something from Munro's own life, but rather surprisingly, they do not carry the emotional impact of the earlier stories.<br /><br />Dear Life is an excellent introduction to Alice Munro's fiction, to her unforgettable characters and the sheer power of her stories.

B009XTF8KQ|4.0|Inspired by LA Times writer Leslie Gornstein's article \\"A Jinx in a Box,\\" this horror film from Ghost House Pictures  tells the tale of a broken family that comes under attack from a malevolent supernatural entity of Jewish folklore. Shortly after her parents (Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick) divorce, a young girl purchases an ornate antique box at a yard sale. In the weeks that follow, the young girl forms an intense fixation on the box, her behavior growing increasingly bizarre as she falls into the grip of a diabolical apparition. When the girl's father discovers that the relic is in fact a holding cell for the disconnected soul of a deceased person who has been denied entry into the afterlife and needs a human host to inhabit, he fights to rid her of the evil that threatens to consume her body and soul.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot better than I expected. I thought Jeffrey Dean Morgan did a excellent job and Natasha Calis was wonderful as Em, the daughter who becomes obsessed with the box. It's not your typical ghost story and I think because Sam Raimi was one of the producers, people expected it to be really, really scary and while it was scary, it doesn't have a lot of blood and gore. It reminds me of Drag Me to Hell, which was another Sam Raimi movie that wasn't really bloody or gory but yet it was scary and really good as well. The ending makes me wonder if there will be a part 2.<br /><br />Give this movie a chance, I think if you watch it with a open mind, you will be pleasantly surprised at how good it really is and it will also make you think twice about buying stuff from a yard sale!

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I was hoping this was funny.  I have a great sense of humor. The laughs were few and far between. i actually feel less intelligent for watching it. I'm glad I only spent 3.99 to rent it rather than going to the theaters.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Heavy hearted story with real characters. No neat and tidy ending. Melanie is a real and unforgivable character who let her daughter's secrets die with her. All together the characters wove a rich tapestry of the human condition. Redolent with its own flaws and pain. Be prepared with a box of Kleenex, you will need it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These are great headphones!! Sound awesome and work pretty well. The only complaint I might have is the drivers are kinda... I dont know they work but I am not sure if the surround really functions. But they do sound awesome either way, range is good too.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|access files, install &#34;unsupported apps&#34;, like the Dolphin browser with adobe flash. Not having flash on the Kindle is unacceptable! This is the solution for now. The web is not moving away from flash even though adobe screwed us. I like to view the web on my tablet and android phone. I dont want a different web for it. A website should be the same on the tablet as it is on the Desktop. Most folks dont even have a desktop anymore...
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Overall, this was a fun game.  Some of the puzzles are difficult to notice that they are even there, and it's hard a solve a puzzle you don't know exists.  One of the limitations of this genre of games is that the length of the story can be time intensive for the creators to generate, resulting in an overall short gameplay experience (3-6 hours), with little replayability.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes pro football. very good movie I love it. no cons at all.

0446672653|4.0|After reading Dr. Weiss' first book, &#34;Many Lives, Many Masters&#34;, many pieces of my life's puzzle were put into place and I wanted to learn more about his work in regression therapy and find more answers to life's questions.  &#34;Only Love Is Real&#34; may not provide the eye-opening accounts found in &#34;Many LIves, Many Masters&#34;, but it is a beautiful story of two soulmates being reunited through the therapy sessions of two of his patients.  Like his prior written work, this book is easy to read and flows in a way that will not allow you to put the book down.  Above all, this true story is about the power of love and how it is, above and beyond the most powerful and important part of our existence on Earth.

B007XIC1GI|5.0|This book was a really good read.  I read it very quickly and though I squirmed through some of it, (I expected that I would) I was mostly just fascinated by it.  My only disappointment was that it ended where it did.  I wish there was a sequel to this book written in the same storytelling fashion.  Maybe someday...

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|good game. starts off taking to much time for things to happen but doesn't take away from it being cool and fun. :)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I can see why this book is on the New York Times bestseller list and Stephen King recommended it highly.  The story draws you in, takes a hold of you and doesn't let you go.  Makes you think what would you do if your child is charged with murdering another child.  This book kept me way up past my bedtime. I read it every chance I got, even in my doctor's waiting room happy about him taking an hour to see me.  I liked the main characters so much that I was feeling what they were feeling, and I was rooting for them. I can't stop thinking about them even though I finished the book two days ago. Order this book right now. You won't be able to put it down either.  I love the way this author writes.  He has made me a big fan of his that I'm ordering his other two books: Mission Flats and The Strangler.  Happy reading to you and to me!

B003PBB4ME|1.0|The item describes itself being a steady cam. I used it this weekend and it hardly does the job.

B0033AGPFS|3.0|The pack of the record, and the whole press is impeccable. The quality of the impressions, the paper, the 180 gram vinyl itself... However I'm disappointed with the sound of it. Much of the people here is very impressed by the sterling mixing that this reissue offers, but personally I didn't like the soundmixing.  This is one of the few albums I'd rather listening the digital version than the analogue one.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I will be honest in stating that the only reason I asked for the blu-ray set as a gift is so that I can legally download an upcoming fan edit of one of these films.<br /><br />The fact is, the original Star Wars is a beloved film trilogy to many.  While this blu-ray transfer does provide for a crisp image of the original prints of the films, it also includes the added CGI and story elements from the re-release of the trilogy in the 90s.  These elements have not been updated to fit today's CG quality and standards despite Lucas being more than happy to further modify additional elements of the films.<br /><br />It would also appear that the color correction in these movies were done by different teams of people for different scenes.  Some of the scenes have a somewhat accurate color to the original releases, while a vast majority have an overly blue and highlighted tone to them.  Yoda's florescent green is of particular disappointment.<br /><br />The fact that Lucas refuses to release a cleaned up version of the original prints is still frustrating to many fans, as they would like access to both Lucas's \\"completed vision\\" for the movies as well as their childhood memory versions as well.<br /><br />The movies themselves are the classics that we have come to know and love, minus of course some of the added CG elements.  There are times when the added elements do enhance and improve the atmosphere and story, while at other times it distracts from and/or cheapens the story in the eyes of many fans.  Lucas did not bother to go back and correct simple-to-fix glaring issues such as incomplete spaceships, wires being seen connecting to lightsabers and yes, even Darth Vader's breastplate being upside down in the first movie.  These things easily could have been corrected but, have not been.<br /><br />Overall, I give 5 to the movies themselves but, 2 to this set for the poor technical quality and lack of restored original prints.

B0076DEJMO|4.0|In some ways, Joe Abercrombie reminds me of a literary Quentin Tarantino. While obviously a talented artist on his own, his real talent lies in how he can twist and contort and pay homage to specific genres within his craft. With The First Law trilogy, Abercrombie created a knowing fantasy saga that was true to the core concepts but also flipped them and the expectations of readers as well. With Best Served Cold, he tackled the revenge tale, and with The Heroes he took on nothing less than the epic fantasy battle. Throughout this he has had major and minor characters come and go, and this specific interweaving of characters that lends his books their solid foundation. Major characters move to the background, minor ones step up, and some just pop up occasionally to remind you that they exist. Seeing old faces while being introduced to new ones has worked well for him in the past, and it's as welcome as ever here.<br /><br />With Red Country, Abercrombie has gone after Westerns, and while the marriage isn't perfect, it works in the end. His characters have often felt like they were just a costume change away from the saloon, and the language and violence is strong enough to feel right at home. Abercrombie also works in several scenes that echo famous Western staples, and it's fun to see where they go from there.<br /><br />The plot of Red Country starts out simple enough, with the kidnapping of protagonist Shy South's siblings, and while the target generally stays the same, the methods of how the plot gets there change over time, evolving with the circumstances. While the book doesn't touch 500 pages, it still packs quite a bit of content, and Abercrombie's dedication to tying up every loose end he can is admirable. There was a part about a third of the way through when I began to have some trouble, but the book picked up from there and just plowed on through to the end, and the conclusion was a surprisingly poignant end, not only to the book itself but also to storylines that were picked up years and years ago. Red Country practically drowns in blood and muck and worse at tiems, but in the end it's all worth it, and Joe Abercrombie has added another fine tale to an impressive collection of them.ines that were picked up years and years ago.

B007SAKY42|5.0|Very satisfied with this acquisition. Despite that the box comes just with the vinyl version of their studio albums (no singles, b-sides xtra tracks on vinyl), I always wondered on how cool it would be having all these albums on vinyl. The press of &#34;Parklife&#34; and  &#34;Modern life...&#34; could have been better. The sound and mixes on all albums is pretty ok, but Im not very satisfied with the mixing of &#34;13&#34; and &#34;Leisure&#34; . The best note is for &#34;The Great Escape&#34;;)
B004856SQ8|4.0|I will keep this review short and sweet:<br /><br />If someone walks into this movie with a love for the original series, they will love the movie.  It truly grabs the best from the original characters and throws them together in an over-the-top physics defying masterpiece of everything that the A-Team was and stood for.<br /><br />There is violence but, it isn't all that graphic in nature.  As the producer Stephen J. Cannell once put it, it is \\"cartoon\\" violence.<br /><br />The acting is great and there is no dull moment in the story to be found.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it!

Despite of the presentation of the vinyl version (that is OK, don't be scared),  the musical production, the quality of the songs, the performance of the band are reaaally convincing. The soundmixing is awesome too. I will not describe this record anymore, just buy it!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended to me and was the first e-book I purchased for my new Kindle.  What a wonderfully written novel!  I was pleasantly surprised.
1469226421|5.0|I cannot say strongly enough how much I loved this book!!! I could not put it down!!  I am picking this one for my book club and I am so excited!!!  I especially loved the fairy tales by Eliza.  I did guess the ending but I was not disappointed at all because the story was so engaging.  It was a tad long however but I read it so fast I didn't care!!  It does jump around from one era to another but once the mystery is revealed it makes total sense.  I just ordered \\"The House at Riverton\\" and I am anxious to read it as Kate Morton is my new favorite author.  Here's to a great book club discussion on a fabulous book!!!
B00129JSMY|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  It may have started as a B movie in theatres, but every actor and actress in this movie delivers a dynamic pperformance.
B00003CX8V|5.0|A, great easy to watch fun movie, the acting is very good, and I think Jack & Shirley act very well together in this. So glad I bought this, so I can watch it whenever I want an easy movie to see.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|For a new writer, an exceptional book & insight into the world of a teenager. It was definitely compelling enough to continue reading as the reader was never sure if it was going to end badly. Would highly recommend.
0525952926|5.0|...even so, i loved \\"fall of giants.\\" i couldn't wait to start WOTW and i very reluctantly finished it last night.  i felt follett spent more time in this book in developing his young characters, mostly made up of the children from FOG.  but i'm glad he did - by the time the world was in turmoil, their struggles, hardships and joys took on new life for me and became my own.  it felt like i was reading about people i actually knew.  it really made that period in history come alive for me more than any history book in school i could have read. especially when you get to pearl harbor.  i felt like i was there - it was so well done.  this book nearly made me weep several times.<br /><br />i liked how follett didn't resort to long, drawn out explanations of where the characters came from, making us re-read FOG - he had enough faith in his readers to know they would already know.  and like someone else pointed out here - WOTW is a stand alone novel - you wouldn't necessarily have to read FOG to enjoy WOTW, but don't cheat yourself and miss it.<br /><br />now i'm in that limbo of separating myself from the world he created while i impatiently await book number three.  i told someone the other day that i would read follett's grocery list because i was sure it would be fast paced and thrilling.

B003DNN0L2|4.0|A great romp- quirky and quotable. Very funny, innovative animations. The intra-family tensions are realistic and resolved. The extra-family tensions are absurd and also resolved. Just the right amount of tension:humor for a light movie that is enjoyable through multiple viewings.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Enticing because the story is unfolding in a way that our usual expectations for a &#34;black and white&#34; delineation of characters is not going to play out here.  It keeps ya coming back
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This book was very good. I mostly enjoyed Data coming back, can't wait to hear what happens next. And poor Worf as if it wasn't enough that he lost his wife Jadzia Dax to a cold blooded killer now he lost his girlfriend to a cold blooded killer. Then there are his past failed relationships. I wonder if he will give up on love now....

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm not going to lie, the books are written in a simple style. You can put images to everything in the book, but in my opinion it was very basic images.<br />The first book was extremely good. I love the storyline and everything unique about this series. But when I got to the second book it seemed like they were adding random things into places they didn't really belong. Like they were trying to answer questions that everyone ha from the first book, but they just stuck the answers into the weirdest places, or maybe they were making it up as they went along.<br />Other than that I also got confused with some f the character choices in the last book. None of it went with their personalities or anything, but overall I still loved the ending since it's not your typical ending that every other book has. I couldn't predict anything that was going to happen that was major to the storyline.<br />Overall, extremely unique story with very unique characters, although the books are a lot more gruesome than the movie, especially the first one. Definitely a re-read so 5 stars!
B00514HDNW|4.0|I felt like there was a missed opportunity there at the end. I'm still glad I read it, but I thought the movies explored the endgame scenario a little more fully (even if I wouldn't necessarily call them better or worse overall.) After reading the final pages, my primary thought was: this was great, but that ending could have been soooooo much cooler.<br /><br />Still, it was very much worth reading and possibly even rereading in a few years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love my horse. It's an awesome game and so clear!  Best animal game out there! There aren't any issues I see. It's fun to feed, groom, and compete in the comfort of your own home.
B000W9399S|1.0|I have read several other Discworld books yet the Color of Magic is by far the worst of any of them. Most of the humor employed by Mr. Pratchett in this first Discworld book feels discombobulated and forced. While attempting some degree of world building the story flows between characters with silly names, to locations with silly names, employing silly situations which are often poorly set up and frequently make no sense. I honestly felt that this book was a colossal waste of time... but I read through it in it's entirety hoping for something to highlight - no such luck.<br />  The two main characters in the story are a foolish tourist (Discworlds' first) and a failed wizard (his guide). They encounter multiple denizens of Discworld, and experience adventures which help educate the reader on the mythos of the Discworld universe.<br />  To end the review on a positive note, I have enjoyed a few of the more recent additions to the Discworld series, they feel much less manic. Mr. Pratchett clearly honed his craft and has written several (in my experience) entertaining and memorable stories.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story.  Getting ready for the next book.  Very excited to get started.<br />This book left me hanging and needing the next book.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Watching Meryl Streep masterbate is not on the top of my list of things to watch... turned it off at that part, wish I would have turned it off much sooner!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I have to say I was VERY impressed with this app.<br /><br />Layout - the app is layer out wonderfully. the main screen is made up of panels that you can swipe to the side to view more stories. each panel is a different catagory like health, science, politics for example. then you can scroll down the page to view more panels. at the bottom there is a customization panel where you can choose to display more catagories.<br /><br />Features - each article usually has a picture, or video, and I. some cases more than one. you can scroll Down to view more of the article, or swipe to the side to smoothly transition to the next article.<br /><br />Memory and permisisions - Doesn't take up much memory, and there are no invasive permissions. scanned with trustgo mobile security and came out clean.<br /><br />overall - awesome news app, the best I have found so far!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I gave this game five stars because the green little guy is so cute. I love how you can change the candy.

0345803485|1.0|I knew from the start that I was not going to like this book. I tried to be open minded, tried to give it a chance, but it was doomed from the start. Perhaps if the writing had been decent I could have gotten into the story a little. Or if the characters weren't so stereotypical. Or if there had been a bit of realism behind all of the bdsm. But everything is wrong with this book.<br /><br />Everyone knows by now that this all started as Twilight fan fiction. Considering the quality of most fan fic, the fact that this actually got published is amazing. I honestly think the editor should be fired for letting such bad writing through. (No one \\"murmurs\\" as much as they do in this book!) The fact that there are so many reviews calling this well written is actually a little depressing.<br /><br />It's bad enough that the sex here is pretty boring and unrealistic (not every orgasm can be mindblowing!). But I think what bothers me most about this book is the representation of the bdsm lifestyle. First off, someone whose knowledge of the lifestyle comes from tv crime dramas should not be writing about it. (Don't even get me started on that ridiculous contract and Ana's insulting comments about some of the activities described in it that made me want to fling the book across the room.) The relationship between Ana and Christian is not \\"normal\\"... it's incredibly dysfunctional. No matter the lifestyle, it is never ok to stalk and control someone at the level exhibited by Christian. As someone who has had control over others, I can tell you that the way he takes over her life is unrealistic and dangerous. The fact that the vanilla world things the depictions are relatively accurate is quite disturbing as well as insulting.<br /><br />I gave the book 1 star because of a couple of scenes that had potential. The set up was good, but they never played out the way they should have. Meaning that they could have been pretty hot, but were brought down by inaccuracies and stereotypes.<br /><br />Once I finished this book, I told everyone I could to not bother reading it unless they really wanted to know how *not* to write erotica. Much like Dan Brown, EL James was sprinkled with PR fairy dust and was in the right place at the right time. It's unfortunate that bad erotica has gotten so popular, but hopefully it will open the market up for some legitimately good writing, whether bdsm or otherwise.r /><br />Once I finished this book, I told everyone I could to not bother reading it unless they really wanted to know how *not* to write erotica.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me since I enjoy a good story with a mystery.  This is not your usual mystery.  The characters are developed and believable and real.  This is one book I would recommend.

B009YP9L7U|2.0|This was a fun read, but very cookie cutter and predictable.  It was something to read, when there isn't anything left to do I guess.

B007N5YJYS|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's 39 Steps is not so much an adaptation of the John Buchan novel as it is a thorough re-imagining -- even the title has a completely different meaning in Hitchcock's hands. That's not to say that it's inferior to Buchan's thriller, or that it's superior. The two are simply different, and both succeed on their own terms. Clever, suspenseful and entertaining, it is one of the classic wrongly-accused-man-on-the-run films out there -- and Hitchcock did some of the others as well, of course. This Criterion edition sports an excellent digital restoration, audio commentary, a Hitchcock documentary, plus interviews with the director and a complete 1937 radio adaptation with Ida Lupino and Robert Montgomery. Robert Donat never looked so good fleeing across the moors of Scotland, and those moors never looked so fascinating. Highly recommended.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|my son loves playing the game it was more than what he had expected  He plays it quite often when he gets a chance to
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my girls (ages 6 &amp; 4) love horses in general, and think this app is great fun! We would definitely. recommend for horse lovers!
0425252868|4.0|A very detailed book about two war time pilots, one a German combat fighter pilot and the other a American B-17  pilot. I wish the author spent more time on the American pilot too. As a retired AF I spent 8 years in Germany and talked to several Luftwaffe pilots and their stories of combat, which were very interesting and enlightening (they had their job as we had ours)<br />Very well written. Excellent.
B000ZBPPWC|4.0|I largely concur with the reviewer of 03/08/12. The Belcea Quartet do a rather good job here with the six quartets of Bela Bartok, a set of compositions which to some extent is an acquired taste. Still the renditions by the Emerson Quartet remain my favorite between the two -- I think the Emersons simply play these pieces with more studied intensity. Still, as I said, these versions are not bad; indeed, they are admirable performances and there's no reason to shun them.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I always have fun with these type of games.the graphics are cool to..I love the adventure.it is worth the money to play.
B0087EACJK|2.0|I thought this would be fun when I was in the hospital, but for some reason I lost interest after a while.  the realized, I don't like this.

1451695195|3.0|Quite apart from the altogether telling observations provided by other reviewers that Dr. Alexander provides no evidence that his neocortex was in fact ravaged into a nonfunctioning state, there is the puzzle of this world.  How to reconcile the existence of that way better place of understanding and infinite love with the rather tawdry and cruel world we currently inhabit?  According to the Christians (and Dr. A is clearly one), the veil of tears is where man works out his salvation.  No such raison d'être for our world is given in the book.  Indeed, Dr. Alexander seems to suggest that we all go to that better place after death.  No punishment, only love.  Which is fine, except why do children get cancer?
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Meh Matt Damon Series is better.  Strictly a rental.  I would not buy this dvd.  Plot was predictable. . .
081297381X|5.0|Still part way through on this book, however, it is well worth the read. Just when you think you have things figured out, life throws you a curve ball and now you know why.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Never a dull moment in any SK book I've ever read, but some are  better than others and this one will go to my \\"top 5\\". I never expected it to be a love story, but as usual with SK it was done perfectly.
030771652X|1.0|I got through the first 48 pages and quit.  The narrative is awful. It's going to the library as a donation.  A total waste of money.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I first heard about James Dasher from a YouTube book review on his first book of the Trilogy \\"The Maze Runner\\" after that review I HAD to check out what that book was all about! And when I began to read the first book I couldn't put it down AMAZING!! I finished the book in 3 days! (not lying... So I had to read the Sequel \\"The Death Cure\\" and that book was equally AMAZING as the first book!! Then I waited awhile for the last book to come out this book \\"The Kill Order\\" (The Maze Runner Prequel) and I was BLOWN AWAY!! This was the ICING ON THE CAKE for me!! I loved at the end when she kissed him so tenderly the feelings just came rushing back to Mark like she'd NEVER left his side then she said that one word \\"MARK\\" I was like \\"OMG Trina's BACK TO HER OLD SELF THANK GOD!!\\" Lol... But I was sad that Alec had to go all crazy at the end just sad! But the Epilogue Two years later was where I was like \\"Awww that's how it ALL BEGAN!\\"<br /><br />  GREAT READ FROM START TO FINISH!!! MUST READ<br /><br />  #1 THE MAZE RUNNER, #2 THE DEATH CURE,#3 THE KILL ORDER!!!<br /><br />  YOU WILL LOVE IT & WONT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN!!!
B002YCVX5S|4.0|Excellent acting. Good directing. Overall story sucks you in until the end when you realize it is not as it appears.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics are fantastic and I loved the gameplay. They give you enough free game to be satisfied, and if you choose to purchase the full game I feel the price is reasonable, especially compared to some other G5 games.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very helpful on a customized android device like the kindle fire.  Everything you think it should do it does, and more.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Not at all as challanging as the original version.  Don't like the birds getting sucked into orbit so you never know where they are really going.
0307454568|5.0|Book arrived in a timely fasion.  Book in new condition.  I have not read it as yet as I am re-reading the first two books in the trilogy.  This is the only one I have not red previously so I am looking forward to it.

080214473X|5.0|Every time I read this book I appreciate this piece of history penned by Mark Bowden even more. Would recommend to fans of military history interested in the most in depth account of this intense battle. 5 Stars.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Matchless stagecraft by European/UK artists (French, English, et al). A masterful adaptation of Victor Hugo's beautifully complex novel; universal messages, top quality music/lyrics. Victor Hugo is rightfully in the 19 C. writer's/thinker's Pantheon. Thank you Cameron Macintosh and West End for setting the bar so high.<br /><br />What's next, with similar depth and quality?
B0063M22QO|4.0|The games start out very easy and progress in difficulty.  For the price, this is a great game, not much left to imagination, but a great beginner choice.  The tiles are quite large and clearly readable.  I like the progression to more complicated games.  I have several different Mahjong games on my Kindle (and on a Nook tablet as well.)  My 5 year old granddaughter picked it up very quickly and enjoys it as well.  It isn't rocket science but does help to keep the brain sharp.
B0007939NO|5.0|I have always liked this movie very much. The misic and the dancing are great. Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse were so good together.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me start this review by stating, I absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book. Hopeless by Colleen Hoover absolutely took my breath away. We have a young girl who falls for what seems to be a bad boy and we are taken through every single complexity young love brings. But, not only is this about young love it explores much deeper issues that most adults do not want to ever discuss.<br /><br />Holder...Can we take a minute and talk about Holder? He is the \\"bad\\" boy and the one you love to hate but you can't help to love him. He seems rough and tough on the outside but he is simply a young man that lives with passion and does all that he can to protect those that he loves. His masculinity jumps from the pages and every single word that comes out of his mouth his believable.<br /><br />Hopeless made me laugh, it made me angry, it made cringe, it made me believe in love, it made me get misty-eyed, and the best part, it made me smile. This book has something for everyone and it deserves all of the recognition it is currently receiving. Hopeless will make you want to have all of your 'firsts' all over again! Read it, and you will understand!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Inspired cinematography. Very talented salmon....and the actors are really good too! Seriously though....this is a beautiful, touching film. Inspires optimism.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I have a kindle fire hd and this app works great. It automatically pulled up the camera to take pictures with. It also allowed me to go into my picture library and use pics already downloaded on my kindle. It saved all my created pics into its own folder and easily shares with facebook and the rest of the social sites. There's even a video camera option, all though I haven't played with it yet. I only wish for maybe a few more filters, but that is a very small complaint. It was worth the download!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Loved it. Can't wait to start reading the next book.  And of course the third book as well :)
B005800DFO|5.0|This is the album that turned me onto them in high school. Possibly their best disc ever...and with all the bonus songs & digitally remastered, this is a must have.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Fantastic book, couldn't put it down. I would put it up on my shelf along with The Fault in our Stars and Looking for Alaska. Deep.
0545265355|1.0|I don't see why all the Hype. It is a book about teenagers forced to murder other teenagers. I see the one stars griping about bad writing. How about griping about a horrific story line? I read it because my daughter wanted to read it. It is as disgusting as I feared. The ending of the fight they are listening to a boy being torn apart slowly by animals. Cat wonders why they just don't kill the poor kid. Peter tells her it would be a ratings killer. I'm sorry I won't let my daughter read this. Call me overprotective if you want but why should she have such images in her mind? Why should any adult?
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Purchaced this as a suprise for my husband.  He has been spending the past few years upgrading his DVD collection to blu-ray and he had been looking for this for several months.  He was very suprised that I found it for him.
B000O174CM|3.0|When I ordered this movie, there was nothing in the description to indicate that it had to be played on a HD DVD player, which I do not have. Also the cover of the DVD was not the same. On the DVD I received, at the very top of the cover, it says HD DVD VERSION which is not what the movie in the artwork for this advertisement says. Be very careful when ordering. I know I am probably one of the last people on the planet to not have a HD DVD player. I am just looking for a version of this movie that I can play on a regular DVD player that has the two-hour documentary and the rest of the special features. If anyone knows where I could get one, please let me know.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE EVEN IF YOU DO OR DON'T LIKE READING I USED TO NOT LIKE TO BUT THIS BOOK CHANGES THAT
B0083GCK5G|5.0|I grew up listening to the Beach Boys so I was excited to get their new album.  My 10-year old is a singer and we attended the The Beach Boys concert last summer. He sings along with this in the car and even intends to sing 'Shelter' at his school's talent show this year.
B005J4TLO8|2.0|Purchaced this as a sticking stuffer for my son, as he had been wanting to go see it for awhile.  Glad we bought it instead of paying $50 to go see it at the theater.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Ready for the third. Great story telling and scene setting. Best series I have read since The Girl with the DragonTatoo.

B008QI6EHQ|1.0|I know the kindle book was only 99cents but this is bad.<br /><br />I'd wonder how difficult kindle programming is --&#62; no working/valid table of contents.  It's purely me as I use the ToC to setup my daily reading --&#62; one or two chapters daily depending on chapter length.<br /><br />The text is what it is but the lack of a working ToC makes this not even worth 99cents.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|maybe use a little work but very good game though but I like how ot goes though and tells u how to work the game
0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a book with an interesting mix of tension, action, and love. It appeals to many different audiences. The tension in this book guides the entire story. You truly feel for the main character, Katniss, who shuts herself away from the world. Peeta, the other main character is very much in love with Katniss but the feeling is not mutual. When he professes his love for her on national television you can feel Katniss tense. Peeta and Katniss have great chemistry, the writing in this book shows their connection and the tension between them. Like a previous reviewer, Michael A. Behr, I believe the book is, \\"brutal, but engaging.\\" It is very hard to put the book down, but is am emotional experience reading it, sometimes downright harsh. \\"I am more than just a piece in their game...We fight, we dare, we end our hunger for justice.\\" One of the powerful quotes said by main character, Katniss Everdeen. In our world we do not have the Hunger Games but we experience war. Fighting for a better tomorrow, not sitting back letting the powerful decide our future. The concept in this book directly applies to current life. I recommend this book to many people, anyone who enjoys a romantic plot, an action packed story, or to the people that like to see issues in another light. This is why I enjoyed the Hunger Games, I thought about things that I usually don't look into. Very interesting book that I will most likely read again.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Very surprised by this movie. Karl Urban should be nominated if the Academy Awards weren't so rigged, because Karl Urban IS Judge Dredd. I really hope there will be a sequel, unfortunately it had a dismal box office performance. Still, great movie.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|A bit of Family mixed in with action. They tried to keep it from being too family oriented, but I think that the mix is just right as it is. It's a great movie dealing with rediscovery, learning what is really important in life, and plenty of robot smash-em fun.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It nearly made soda come out of my nose! I would recommend this book for its witty humor and interesting stories!
B0085KGHI6|4.0|I saw this on TV one night and thought it was great!  It's a wonderfully raw filming of an impromptu performance of the Stones with Muddy Waters... so awesome!  I knew my dad would love it too so I bought it for him for Christmas!
B00003CXAA|5.0|i love these movies. i watch them with my dad whenever i go to visit him. we have something called godfather night. we stay up and watch all 3 films right in a row!
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This is a bit more of a puzzle solver game in some ways, in the lines of Myst than say King's Quest. Then again, it is also nothing like the Interactive Fiction of the past. The puzzles don't seem to be too hard, but its a little too easy to get to the spoilers and solve everything that way too.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It nearly made me lose it! I would recommend this book to people who like humour. Two thumbs up, it's great!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|My boyfriend really likes this movie.  We saw it in the theaters and then rented it on Amazon because we missed the first part at the theaters.  It's a good movie with good action and a pretty good cast.  There are some cheesy parts... but overall it's pretty good.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|in this film harry, ron and hermione discover the secret of voldemorts immortality. the seven horcruxes. in hpdhpt2 harry finds out that he is the seventh horcrux who was turned to a horcrux by accident. voldemort needed harrys blood to gain full strength back in hpatgof. what voldemort didn't realize was that harrys blood contained an accidental horcrux in his blood. @the very end of hpatdhpt2 is that when voldemort ''killed'' harry he didn't really ''kill'' him. he actually destroyed his 7th and last remaining horcrux. harry always had a horcrux inside of him. when voldemort tried to ''kill'' harry he ''killed'' the last part of his soul. he didn't kill harry. harry saw the horcrux of voldemort come out of him. then he was able to destroy voldemort, with the elder wand!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Found this movie quite entertaining.  The special effects were good.  Really thought Charlize Theron was great in this movie as the evil queen.  Chris Hensworth is gorgeous.<br />The downside: There were a few slow spots and it seemed a little longer than it needed to be.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoy these games, but I wish you didn't have to be stopped in the middle until you buy.  Worth the small payout.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he absolutely loves it!  He's a die hard Ozzy fan and said he couldn't stop laughing while reading this book... he also said it's filled with fun facts that he didn't know about before.  If you're an Ozzy or Black Sabbath fan... it's a must read!
B000JLTRIQ|4.0|i liked this movie a lot but every time i would watch it i'd cry. keep a box of kleenex on hand when watching this. you will need it. for sure
B00821OW8K|1.0|Well, It's lost, it's prison break, it's everything you've already seen. It's just another dumb soap who's plot is completely unrealistic and who's acting is mediocre. When I say unrealistic, I'm not talking about the aliens, I'm talking about the events surrounding them, the way people react and the way people treat each other and the aliens. Nearly every character is an antagonist and acts in an unrealistic way.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I first became aware of Jonathan & Charlotte on a YouTube video of &#34;Britian's Got Talent&#34;. I followed up on them later on and was disappointed that they didn't win that seasons show. However; I was very pleased that Simon Cowell signed them to a recording contract for his own company.. This is their launch album. It's a great start especially knowing the back story of these two fantastic youngsters.I look forward to future recordings.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|It was awesome I encourage anyone to read this book it rocked  please it is awesome<br />P.S<br />BUY GIRL SCOUT COOKIES
B00008PW3Q|5.0|i got to see the ''say you will'' tour in concert. there's many surprises, too. beautiful child was finnally sung by stevie at a fleetwood mac concert. i never thought that would happen nor did stevie herself but when she sang it she nailed it! it's not a very happy song but it touched my heart when she sagn it both etched and anguished but with a smile on her face @the same time. it was sad but also cool and a very interesting performance by stevie. one thing stevie is about is surprises. she keeps a listener guessing from the beginnings of her shows and to the ends!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always loved spider on my PC. This is just as good if not better; because I can travel around with it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Another great game from Alawar.  I'm playing on a Samsung Galaxy Note and it works great.  The scenes are drawn so well that even middle-aged eyes can see all the detail.  Storyline is interesting and the &quot;mood&quot; is appropriately spooky.  I'm getting faster at choosing games for this phone.... I just search on &quot;Alawar&quot; and pick one, no losers yet. Fun stuff.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good story, moved along at a good pace, kept me interested all the way through.  My only problem with this book is that the author needs to learn a few more adjectives.  The only one she seems to know is f--- and its derivitives and she used them a lot.
0545128285|5.0|jk rowling is the master of storytellers! a book about a book? that's unusual for most writers. a book about a book? it can't get any better than that. my favorite fairytale from this book is ''the 3 brothers''. it explains about ''the 3 deathly hallows'' which combined can make a wizard invincible. in the final movie, hpatdhpt2 voldemort claims the elder wand which was previously dumbledores wand. voldemort tries hard but he can't get the wand to work. spoiler follows: in the end of the second movie harry catches it and ends up killing voldemort with it!
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of iMediashare for two specific use cases:<br /><br />1) Sharing videos & pics that i've taken with a broader audience at home (way better than having people hover over my android device)<br />2) Sharing viral videos with a broader audience at home or at a party etc (so much cooler watching \\"gangam style\\" on an hd tv vs a 3 inch phone screen)<br /><br />If you have a web-enabled tv or one of the compatible streaming devices, this is a must have app.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|Best movie I have seen that show the possibility of romance in BDSM instead of just the hyper sexuality normally associated with people in the community. Would recommend to anyone who is curious of BDSM and to those who are already into the culture. Love, love, love this movie!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Woohoo!<br />Nice little game to pass the time! Plenty to do and it keeps you busy. Downloaded it to give it a try, and the ads weren't as bad as people say they are
B005ZUR724|4.0|lots of fun.  is playable on SOME phones. seems like an easy to play version of world of warcraft but its still fun. been playing since it started. i dont like that it is pretty much necessary to buy the runes for rune gear. other than that i love the game.
0765325950|5.0|Started reading this series like many people more than a decade ago and like most of us got frustrated with the lack of progress sometimes made in some of the books having to wait years for the next installment etc.... Well when the news of the series being finished after mr Jordan's passing was announced I decided to start fresh and re read each one thinking by the time i finished memory would be ready.... Ha I waited another year after re reading each one but wow it was worth it. Great ending but I still want more, I'll miss these characters and one day probably re read the series again.
B000FBFM9S|5.0|I hadn't read this when it first came out--it's been on my mental list of books to get around to. It exceeded all of my expectations, one of those rare books that has robbed me of much-needed sleep because I couldn't put it down.
1400086035|5.0|With Jim Dale as the read, it doesn't get any better.  I have listened to it several times and it is always amazing.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|i though thtat this game was really really really really really LAME I think it was poorly put together too.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I liked this Robin Hood much better than the one with Kevin Costner.  The view from &#34;Before the legend&#34; realy was enjoyable.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I read this several years ago, and recalled at the time my main reaction was, &#34;They'll never make a movie out of this one.&#34; So when the movie came out, and everybody else became interested in the book, I figured I should reread it. I had lent out my copy, which never came back, so I had to order a new one. Bottom line--it was one of the relatively few books that I have found well worth reading again. And no, they should not have made a movie out of it. It's sad to see a lousy movie made from a great book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My granddaughter put this on my Kindle.  She loves it.  I don't have a lot of patience for these kinds of games<br /><br />, I play it.  Good for the brain.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Its so rare that I get to put on music and just let it play but this is one album that from start to finish I can just let it play and enjoy every song. My favorites are Can you Learn and Hallelujah. T.I. really did his thing on this one! Good job, TIP!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie was fun to watch and I really enjoyed it. I believe its box office failure was attributed to the 'just another comic book movie' mentality.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|The musicality is just fantastic.  And, the lyrical as well, but that's to be expected.  Amy Lee has THE voice!  I hope she continues to grace us w/her talent for a long time to come!
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|got the offer for this application and it looked cool.downloaded it and it wont even open,. tried reloading it as well as restarting. my kindle without success. I hate being invited to a party then not being allowed. to play!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is a great one for everyone because you can raise your own horse so giddy up yourselves!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I started reading this series just to see what all the fuss was about. By the end of the first one I was captivated. At the end of the second one I was mad. Half way through this one I quit reading for several months because I was so mad. However, after just finishing I have to say overall I loved this book series and would recommend it to anyone. :)
B007IK44CK|2.0|The name's Hunt; Ethan Hunt.  So, you're going to launch a Russian nuke at the U.S. to start a nuclear war and change life or Earth.  Thank you, Q, for all the tech-toys I will need at the right time.  Is that a bad guy with bionic teeth?<br /><br />Cruise should have taken another item from our favorite British agent:  How to look cool when you're over 50. I could not take this old man seriously in jeans and a hoodie.  Tommy looks too old to wear the clothes of a teenager.<br /><br />Finally, how does our super-agent, who handled dozens of enemy agents across several time zones get his ass kicked at the end by a frumpy, overweight, 65-year-old? Enough was enough at that point.  If Cruise is going to take Bond's plot, then to be trained better and dressed properly, Hunt needs to leave IMF for MI6.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but this book was fantastic couldn't stop reading it. Great story couldn't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the most amazing book in the world aside from Monkingjay which IS the world's greatest book in the world!
B002M2T1UO|1.0|I'm not sure why these DVDs are in such poor condition, but of the four DVDs from the set I've tried to play, three of them are so badly scratched that the disc skips and I miss portions of the episodes. I don't have any reason to think this isn't brand new, but the discs themselves have adhesive on them and appear to have been rubbed with a nail file. Very disappointed. Unfortunately I didn't discover this until the return window had passed so I'm stuck with a very expensive set of coasters.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|We enjoyed the movie and I loved the characters - especially Julie Andrews!  I found I needed a list of the actors who voiced the roles in front of me!<br /><br />Wonderful plot and clever script.
0345803507|5.0|Awesome story!  I wish the story had another book to continue there story together.  Will look into more books by E.L. James.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|great app Will use all Longview as possible think Igor it good servers he's Dr fxgxgckgcgchchvh . droughts f2f vgxhvgxhvhcjvg etc :(x g chcgchvchnchfchx watchful at Xbox
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|My nephew insisted I get this game because he plays it on his I-pod.  It is somewhat like facebook games but a the lower levels there is not much to do but buy habitats and dragons, breed dragons and grow food.  He tells me I can race them once I reach a higher level.  Will keep it on my kindle so we have a common ground for discussions.
1742200206|3.0|Lonely Planet guides tend to be hit or miss lately. LP's New York City is a bit of a disappointment since it focuses on Manhattan primarily, with only a bit of Queens or Brooklyn. In a way, this book is good if you've got a few days in NYC and don't plan on venturing out across the river, but it's a bit of a disappointment for a guidebook series that touts themselves as a deep dive into the city with lots of information.<br /><br />The LP design is pretty impressive - lots of bright color, nice photos and a handy pull-out map. If I had a limited amount of time in NYC and wanted to maximize it, then this book would be pretty awesome - especially if you're a fan of LP's books.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me as someone who has been to NYC a few times, I'm not sure if this book would do it for me. Next time I visit I want to spend more time off Manhattan in Queens or Brooklyn. Other than the basics, this book doesn't dive too much into them.<br /><br />Note: Other reviewers have mentioned that there's inaccuracies in this book. I haven't noticed because I haven't spot checked. Unfortunately I think this is more of a growing trend when it comes to LP titles. If anything, double check via phone or web to see if they're still around and the hours haven't changed.
0756405890|5.0|It's so disappointing for me to see so many hopelessly uninformed negative reviews for this spectacular work of fiction. Like his protagonist, Patrick Rothfuss is an artist, a musician. Reading his writing is like watching a painting being born, stroke by stroke. Sure, it's long. But like the painting, the thousands of strokes take a beautiful final form, and the thrill of discovery as real and intimate shapes emerge from the canvas is almost as satisfying as the grace of the artist's touch. Rothfuss could have written the book in 200 action-packed pages, but then again, Michelangelo didn't need a whole ceiling to draw a picture of God, did he?<br /><br />If you love a great story, if you appreciate masterful storycraft, or if you live for characters of life-like complexity, read this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I liked this because now I know that I can use this for a word I don't know .I really can!!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Not sure quite how this works.  I play farmville on the full internet facebook and this version does not quite work the same way.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Like my title states: sometimes a little confusing but it works itself out.  Good performances by all & makes you think.
0446554995|3.0|I have read all previous Pendergast novels & I found this one to  have a tedious pace & weak working premise
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It  was funny but I was expecting something way better. It wasn't as interesting as all the other ones. Is Jeff Kinney loosing his touch?
B0063IH60K|3.0|Standard solitaire game.  Do not like ads popping up.  Will keep for awhile until I find something better.  This is the free version.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This concert managed to round up such a talented cast. Alfie Boe is spectacular as Jean Valjean. All of his songs are full of power and resonates with pure grace and elegance. Norm Lewis is without a doubt the best Javert ever. There aren't enough words of praise to be used for this man, just absolutely breathtaking and amazing. Samantha Barks is the perfect Eponine, with so much emotion and sincerity in her singing that it's always heartbreaking.<br />I absolutely loved Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras, beautiful singing coupled with an intensity fit for the role of a revolutionary student hungry for a new world. And Katie Hall was incredible as Cosette. Normally Cosette's role is somewhat overshadowed by the more devastating stories of Fantine, Jean, and even Eponine, but I feel that Katie did a great job making Cosette so much more dynamic. She has a very beautiful voice and also adds a little more to the role in her acting. Matt Lucas is Thenardier, perfect casting. All of the students were right on the mark as well. Hadley Fraser as Grantaire puts more heart into the role than I'd seen before. Killian, Jamie, Alistair, Owain stood out in their roles. This was a great concert in general with talented singers and actors. Still on the fence about Nick Jonas as Marius, though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it page turner, read it in a day!!!!<br />I am on the thierd book and I've stopped reading on page 300 because I don't want it to end!!! I really loved it!!!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is a good game but not so nice getting hit by a train or getting caught by a cop. This is really a glorified version of temple run! This is semi harder than temple run though I still like temple run better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun addictive and realistic graphics.  cute. It reminds me of the horse I used to have when I was younger.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|raise your own horse and give it a style you can buy things for it and even have more than one horse best game ever i love it
B007JRU2UK|5.0|My friend--who is also from Hawaii, like me--told me about this movie, but it took me almost a year to finally watch it, because I thought it would be just another hokey movie set in Hawaii. Well, I ended up loving it! It may have helped that a lot of it took place on Kauai (where I'm from), and that the Hawaiian music in it was fantastic; but additionally, it was a great story, with great characters. I always thought George Clooney was just an okay actor, but he was fabulous in this movie, and I now see him in a totally different light.<br />This movie had great drama, out of which came hilarious moments, as things unfolded; or rather, unravelled--making this my kind of movie.<br />Watch it, you'll love it!
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd 3D is, in one word, terrific.  Forget the horrible Stallone version of the character; this is the definitive dystopic representation of one of Britain's greatest comic book characters, brought to the big screen by a perfectly cast Karl Urban.  Alex Garland and co have done for Judge Dredd what Christopher Nolan did for Batman. It's like Robocop meets Training Day. If you've been sitting on the fence about seeing this film - don't wait any longer - buy a copy.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game had a decent story line, interesting graphics and detailed progression. the puzzles posed little challenge though, nor did the hidden object scenes. but overall, i enjoyed it and would play the sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun and has good graphics super cool you are able to name your horse train it and feed you can even do competitions
B005VPRFSY|5.0|IF YOU LIKE LEGO AND STAR WARS AND COLLECTIONS...THERE YOU HAVE IT... IT'S A NEVER ENDING COLLECTION......ENJOY IT NO MATTER YOUR AGE!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was my first King book and I loved it.  I have always enjoyed Koontz and decided to go out on a limb and try a King book.  Plus, I'm a sucker for the time travel genre. I was not disappointed in the least.  An easy to read page turner. Highly recommended.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|The writer is extremely skillful but the episode is too brief for him to achieve a meaningful plot or develop his characters into believable &#34;beings.&#34; In addition to really enjoy fantasy one must be able to suspend reality, but in this tale the mechanics employed by the protaganist to accomplish her objective boarded on the absurd and thus significantly deminished its overall appeal to this reader.
B000KKPN5C|1.0|This flash didn't seem to provide any more light than the small built-in light on the camera.  We tried it several times and ended up sending it back.
1439127700|5.0|This is a great book.  A wonderful read.<br />So interesting.  Well worth the time and<br />it will be passed on to friends as mine has been.<br />Fast shipping too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|wow. holy hell. I'm speechless. I couldn't put this down. I love the characters, the plot, the pacing, the twists... and holy smokes, this book had the hottest scene and no one even kissed! I'm in awe of Colleen Hoover. She makes me want to be a better author.<br />(As a side note, I basically read paranormal. But this had my attention every bit as much. That's not easily done. )
B00ARN0WBW|5.0|I  love the paranormal activity franchise....  Cant wait till the fifth movie comes out.  I like the way the film was made.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A book about cancer,and a love story about 2 teenage cancer patients. I didn't find it depressing at all. Quite different..
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Really great book.  Nelson DeMille did it again!<br />A really interesting book about Yemen.<br />Fun characters, fast and exciting.<br />Worth the read!!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Good movie ! I could not catch all the words, so It would be nice if Amazon can add subtittles or caption in the future.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This is a wonderful fantasy movie to watch with a great cast of characters. I do not get tired of seeing it. You can only watch the expanded movie on DVD, Amazon does NOT have it as an instant rental to watch. This is one of my all time favorite movies and should stay that way.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|It is handy in my IPAD and I could find more information in ESV Study Bible. You need to have it, if you study bible.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|The best feature of this excellent book is that it demonstrates that you don't have to risk hundreds of thousands of dollars or even quit your day job in order to try out a business idea.  The true stories of actual startups will make you consider what you could do to make a good living doing what you love.
B004OR1XGK|5.0|This book should be compulsory reading for software engineers starting out and veterans alike - to teach good programming practice and act as a refresher (respectively).
B002WJI658|4.0|The young person I purchased this for enjoys it greatly and plays with it regularly. The product arrived in the time specified. It looks and is the quality I had expected.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|What a brilliant read.  It is the best book I've read and I am so looking forward to seeing the movie. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You cannot lose when readind a Nicholas Sparks book.  Safe Haven was a very fast read.  I enjoyed it very much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades got better with each book. By book two I was hooked and this Fifty Shades Freed was the very best.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|From one page to the next the author is repeating the same thing over and over.  The story line drags which makes for a very boring book.  Christian is bending over backwards to show and tell Ana his feelings and it goes in one ear and out the other. He is compromising and changing and growing as a person while she is still the same selfish childish woman she has always been.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is sci-fi of the best kind. The kind that does not focus on the sci-fi part of it at all.<br /><br />The sci-fi, the ships, the interplanetary travel is just there. In the background. Looking great.<br /><br />What makes Firefly so cool are its characters. It's the story of a handful of outlaws that somehow become some sort of a dysfunctional family. And then keep doing outlaw-ish things.<br /><br />Yes, it's like a western in space. And it's great because of it.<br /><br />One of Whedon's finest works.
0671027344|5.0|I seriously read this book in a day. It is kind of short but I could not put it down! I caught myself laughing out loud several times.  It gave be that happy feeling while and after reading it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a elrealoy good game sn d its fum @oo. i hade a lt f fun lauomhni iy. ever y body should get this g game.
6305949980|5.0|I bought it for a Christmas gift at the last minute. It arrived quickly before Christmas, and my daughter loves it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A great piece of science-fiction, this book works like a documentary of an already past global zombie outbreak in a not so distant future.<br /><br />It is presented as a collection of testimonies by survivors of what people call the Zombie War, or World War Z. As that, it has an intensity a novel may have not reached. This feel like real people recalling real horrors. An it paints a very big picture.<br /><br />This books feels based on other testimonies of people recalling real wars. It is well written and creates a really good ambience around the story. It feels almost real. Real enough to feel epic: this is a battle for the survival of mankind.<br /><br />Any sci-fi reader, who doesn't want to read a story about a handful of people running and running and running ahead of some zombies, must consider this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could really get in to the  character having experienced a similar life.  I can only hope my protecter is out there for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome loved it it is a great. Continuation of the saga with New characters that truly enrich the story. Great stuff
B000001FO4|3.0|This is obviously a bootleg CD. Need to update your recording equipment. The music is there but the sound lacks clarity and quality.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This book is really good. It almost makes you want to drop whatever you're doing and beging preparing yourself for when the zombies come.<br /><br />But it also feels so serious. In some parts it gets kind of boring. Not enough for me to drop it, but still. It takes itself seriously enough to give detailed information about nearly anything related on zombie anatomy an behavior. Also every option you may have to survive a zombie outbreak is also thoroughly explained, with many possible outcomes.<br /><br />The description of recorded zombie outbreaks through history is very, very cool.<br /><br />But from a literary point of view, this is a really outstanding book. It doesn't matter how big of a parody this is, it never drops the straight face. It will always tell you the zombies are coming and what your best chances of surviving are. It will never crack a joke nor break the fourth wall. Not even in the acknowledgements.<br /><br />For Mr. Brooks, as this books is concerned, the zombies ARE COMING.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I only used it once, but it worked very well, as expected. The light and timer is just as I expected.
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|The watch is a gift for my husband,we all like it. It is beautiful,and cheap,quality is good.that all,no others.very good
B008XG1X18|4.0|so much fun. I enjoy putting my boards together during my  down time it allows my imagination run wild. I'm allowed to follow my facebook friends which is pretty neat.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone has been telling me to read these books and I finally read this one and it was better than I imagined it was going to be. Can't wait to finish the series, the story line is great!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|the game is fun and cute but you get to a point where you have to buy things with real money and some things cost 75 to $100. bad money system
0399226907|5.0|My love this book, it is a bit long for my 13 month old but she will grow into it. very colorful
B00APUYN0I|5.0|The jokes work, the singing is great, song selection are great- shutouts to 80's music and The Breakfast Club...and Elizabeth Banks to boot. Great fun, lots of laughs!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Part two of this series just gets better after reading this one! Cannot wait to start the final book, the story line pulls you right in!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love this series couldn't ask for a better sequel! Loved the first one now love this one even more can't wait to read the next one!
0399230033|5.0|This book is very good, My daughter loves the pictures and the wording is just right for the attention spam
0440237688|5.0|I read this for the first time when I was 11 or 12 and I absolutely loved it.  We had quiet reading time in my English class the year I read it and I recommended it to other kids I knew.  I remember distinctly looking across the room one day to see one of my classmates reading it staring at me with an \\"Oh My GOD\\" expression on his face.  Ha ha.<br /><br />I have gone back to this book and read it as an adult and it holds up.  It's just a really solidly written, interesting book and GREAT absolutely great for young people who are just starting to get into that mode of curiosity and rebellion.  :D
