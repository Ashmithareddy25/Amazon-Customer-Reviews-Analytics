B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works really great and makes me wonder why the high speed charger and usb cable did not come with the Kindle to start with.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I saw the play and liked it so much, decided to purchase this book. Still haven't gotten to read it yet so really don't have a good comment......
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I always new Norah Jones wore many hats, but this CD proves it without a doubt. From Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, to Outkast and Foo Fighters, it is all here. I gave it four stars for only one reason. If you go back with Ms. Jones to her very beginnings, and want nothing but Norah (although she does sing on every track) then this might not be to your liking. However, if you are open minded and are sought of &#34;late to the party&#34;, meaning 2008, then maybe you should pass on this. If you are like me, and are adventurous with musical styles, then you MUST have this in your collection. It will not knock you out of your seat right away, but then it happens, it is like your 18yr. old teenager burned a playlist and said &#34;hey dad, you like Norah Jones, I made this for you&#34;. Then you give a few listens in your car, and you begin to see Norah in a brighter light, and start to think like she does. That their are really only two types of music: &#34;Good and Bad&#34;. If Ms. Jones enjoyed being stretched than you can do it to. Congratulations, you just past the test to getting what &#34;Featuring&#34; is all about. After that you are hooked. Do not go thinking that you will be waiting for next Foo Fighters CD to drop, but you just got to loving the layers of this grand playlist. Go ahead, buy it, and in one week you will be listening to a Five star truly grand eclectic CD. After that you are on your own. It has you in its spell like the the grand playlist that shows why Norah Jones is one of the great artists of our time. I would like to see someone like Diana Krall attempt a CD like this. However this cross bred has been carefully picked. I have been listening to this since I got it !!
B004SKQAJI|2.0|I never finished watching the whole video because It was so poorly filmed that I finally shut if off . You felt like you were viewing it from the very last seat in the balcony. It was very disappointing .
B004W2V254|5.0|Honestly one the best movies I've seen. A really good, inspiring story that also happens to be true.I love it!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This series held my interest and entertained me.  Once I got used to the British accents it was a very enjoyable. The clothing is gorgeous and the story full of drama with both the class and servents. Would highly recommend.
B00B80ZG6O|5.0|I have for sixty years been a lover of Italian and French operas.  Sort of cool to Wagner.  Jonas Kaufmann has changed that.  This CD is a must for all opera lovers.  His singing is beyond amazing.  Tone beautiful, dynamics exquisite and rendition of the characters and their plight truly remarkable.  A Must for music lovers everywhere.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is very fun.  It is an obvious rip off of Mario, but who cares, it's free!  The Irish music is very catchy and fun, and the graphics are beautiful on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and everyone - after all, it's free! (and incredibly fun).<br /><br />The only issue I have had is that the right directional &#34;button&#34; on the touch screen doesn't always work.  The button will be lit up - showing that I am indeed pressing it - but &#34;Lep&#34; won't move.  This has sometimes led to Lep's unfortunate demise.  However, this doesn't happen too often, and once you are aware of it, you are able to work around it.
B0014JLYS8|5.0|Got these for my boyfriend a year ago, he works as a cook. They are still like new, they are very durable(and very comfortable from what he  says). They are easy to clean and the perfect choice if you're working in a restaurant.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believed all of this already though not in this much detail. This confirms it all. Guess I should however read the rebuttal.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is such a cute movie! it grabs my 15 month old son's attention, which is definitely appreciated! I also enjoyed it. All of the Ice Age movies are awesome, and this was just as good as all the others if not better.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I picked this up after seeing it on Kotaku and i'm glad I did. Even though it's another hero's journey the story stays entertaining till the end. Some might be turned off by the countless references the book makes, but the nostalgia from my childhood makes me grin.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|An absolutely wonderful musical but most of the versions of the songs are not up to the stage performances. I know it was not recorded in a studio which is unusual. However just because of the songs themselves and after seeing the film I did enjoy the CD. Maybe Russell Crowe could have had a bit more &#34;OOMPH&#34; but the rest were adequate, some more than others
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its so cool how you can take care of the horse and compete I loved this app its turely amazing and great picture. its a really cool app
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the game you've been looking for if you're a fan of the Slender games. This is the ONLY real slender game available on the Amazon market, and though not quite as good as the original PC version, it does have all the basic elements of the original Slender that made it scary. If you're looking for a Slender Game of true quality, this is your best choice. When I first played, this game had me screaming and on edge. Absolutely worth the price, and a true Slender experience.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|Couldn't figure out was free and what had to be paid for.  I thought I was technically literate, but I must be getting old.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Before I saw this movie, the whole &#34;Star Trek&#34; thing was 'meh' to me.  I liked it but it wasn't any big deal.  &#34;Star Wars&#34; (imo) was far superior. (Don't be hating on me, I take George Takei's stance; there's room to love both.)<br /><br />Now...<br /><br />JJ Abrams and the cast of this movie completely blew me away. Action, drama, humor, a little bit of romance, edge of the seat suspense, Star Trek (2009) has it all.  I watch this movie at least once a month.<br /><br />&#34;Into Darkness&#34; comes out my birthday week.  I can't wait for the party which is ending with the midnight showing!
B003ES61EE|4.0|Well priced and equal to anything else on the market.<br />Slips easily into camera bag.<br />Quicker than the wet-wipe style cleaners (although they are not aimed at all the same contaminants.)
B009M4KTEM|5.0|First off and foremost, the sound quality here is stunning. The two tracks Hunter sings are worth it alone. There is no booklet or liner notes. It is a good relaxing listen.<br />It should be noted that if purchased direct through Garcia website, you have the option of getting a bundle that includes a shirt and poster.<br />The poster is limited to 600 and is signed and numbered. This is the real collector's item.
B00402FGE4|4.0|Universe started out a little slow, compared to original stargate, and Atlantis, however got hooked by the 3rd episode-too bad they didn't make more of this series.  Liked the &#34;visits&#34; from McKay, O'Neill, Daniel Jackson and Carter.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Indeed a very good film,although Denzel Washington has stared in few films that have been flops in my opinion. I certainly think this movie was worth the rental fee and I believe that anyone who watches it could only come to same conclusion. It certainly is a good movie to see.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|Loved the final season, but was left wanting more-they could have developed the story line alot longer. Having Stargate withdrawal.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|It's sad when people can make accurate jokes about a broken justice system with its technicalities and fine details. Then again, when you've been planning vengeance for ten years and have studied in all that time, what can one do besides exacting that plan? Ask Clyde, who's trying to get his late wife's rapist/child's murderer to be legally dead. Problem is, with the way the judicial system is, he could get away, and he knows it. So, after taking the law into his own hands, things play out precisely as he expects them to, including him being thrown into jail and having court procedures and hearings and getting called a &#34;criminal&#34; with no one giving a second thought about the cause behind his motive. But even in the courtroom does Clyde's guile play out effectively.<br />Throughout a whole process of exacting vengeance for his wife and daughter, he comes up with cruelly inventive ways of killing key people and &#34;pawns&#34; off, manipulating things to show &#34;lessons&#34; of what happens when people don't do things the precise way he requests them to be. And none of it is for the faint of stomach nor heart.<br />Though it's called &#34;Unrated Director's Cut,&#34; it could also be called the &#34;Original NC-17&#34; edition since it was threatened to be that rating if they didn't shave some of the violence out. They did, as well as have additional dialogue (some comical, some just because) and things that may have improved the story, but only slightly, just to give slightly more personality to key characters.<br />This was a great film to have, but only watch if you can handle the extremely disturbing violent content and can handle the language used,or can handle certain shocking death sequences. Some, though I've watched this a couple times, still manage to make me jump, no matter how much I anticipated and flat-out expected them.<br />That just shows this has effective storytelling.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|It is a beautiful story of endearing love and loyalty. The movie has great characters portrayed by an awesome cast.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|So much fun and so easy.  The sounds effects make me want to watch Star Wars.  Definitely would recommend it.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Eric Ries does a superb job giving practicals on the innovation process and how to do it efficiently and effectively. A must read for every executive who desires to grow their company and aspiring entrepreneur who wants to successfully implement their vision.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wasn't sure I liked it better than the original, but it has grown on me.<br />I haven't played the original in several weeks so I guess that answers that question.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is pretty fun, it passes the time on long drives and keeps you guessing. I would recommend to anyone, and its free so that's a plus
0060589272|5.0|Paulo Coelho is such an amazing writer, and every time he publishes something new he reminds me once again why I love his work so much! If you want to read about love, heartache, the cruelty of life and the overcoming of obstacles, this is the book to read! A very riveting story...!
B007TVANDM|5.0|A nice mellow bedtime read.<br />My daughter and I enjoyed the moral of the story which is a positive way of dealing with all that life throws at you.
0060001941|5.0|This is a classic, every lady wether she be a girl or a woman should have read at least once in her life time, preferably at a young age because it is a classic coming of age story about love, dreams and that awkward moment between birth and death called life. I absolutely loved it! I read it in Middle School and it still remains in my top list of favorite novels of all time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What more can I say.  It's addictive & I love it!  I needed to add 5 more words to submit this review.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|We rented this because we love Bruce Willis and several of the other actors in the movie. The mid-sixties period sets the background for this quirky young, love story. The characters' staid lives are suddenly scrambled by a couple of stoic yet star-crossed kids. Outstanding performances come from both the veteran favorites and new youthful actors. This is a fun watch, but I  left wanting a little more in story. I won't spoil it, by telling the ending, but the story buildup leads you to this inevitable conclusion especially as you watch the last of the action scenes unfold with sometimes cartoonish tableau displays.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun movie. I hope they do well with the awards ceremonies.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie is Bourne only in title. There is some action, but the suspense and drive of the other Bourne movies is missing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Made us laugh, made us cry, it doesn't get any better than this!<br />We were sad to see it end.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|This movie was missing the humor and rhythm the first two had. If you loved the first two, maybe watch it, but I would not recommend watching this movie.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I had tried other puzzle apps before this one and hadn't been impressed, but this one is fantastic! There are lots of puzzles to choose from and game play is smooth and easy, with varying difficulty based on size and whether you choose to have to rotate pieces. I have already recommended it to several fellow puzzle lovers. Great app!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was very moving and energetic I'm not a fan of the red room but the rest was wonderful!  I am jealous of Ana I'll take me some Grey but he does have commitment problens
B005HPA2XI|4.0|The album is amazing. Great riffs, technicality and catchy hooks. This album isn't worth it, though. Just get the regular edition. The only other thing you get is a DVD with 20 boring minutes. That isn't worth an extra $10.
B000NY17J6|3.0|Seems like too many of the old songs from an era that displeased me.  Most of the songs on this disc annoy me but others may be pleased.  It's my personal preferance!
0385344333|4.0|Lee Child's books are always a good read.  This book starts slowly, but builds momentum before the middle of the book.  It is a good plot with an unusual twist at the end.  I liked it!
B00631VJIC|5.0|Do I dare say bad of this disc????  The sons may come find me!!!!!!  Hahaha!  There is no room to say anything bad about this disc.  It's sooooooooooooo awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1577314808|5.0|Many people have recommended this book to me over the years. I'm not sure why I didn't pick it up until now. I'm so thankful that I finally did.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Awesome book flabbergasted at the end . Theresa was my favorite character of all and I also liked minho !
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have seen this many times and never get tired of it!!! the animation is great and it has a wonderful story!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Total waste of time, this book is just a rip-off of the Twilight saga: the characters, their behavior, even some of the events are exactly the same! The story, however, is a bit different, BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY, there is no plot whatsoever. I just cannot understand what the fuss is about, I mean, are we so desperate for sex that even books like this make it to the top? Disappointing, to say the least.
B00023B1A8|1.0|Poor accoustics and Stephen Stills' voice is gone.  Cover of DVD showed CS&N thirty years ago, giving impression that concert occurred then.  Concert probably happened after 2000 and they ain't what they used to be.  Worst concert video I've ever seen.
B004D7GU3M|5.0|I am Very happy with the purchase! It arrived on time and I would definitely Like to purchase from you again!!!!!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is the second of two AMC series I went to catch up with, because this and \\"Mad Men\\" were constantly winning awards, and my favorites were being left in the dust. Both series had a hurdle for me. How can I possibly empathize with a meth manufacturer and dealer (the two lead roles). As it turns out, the story line is so inventive and so believable that it is hard not be be drawn into the perils of these characters which are so totally under water. The story on the face of it is so tense, that the show's creator had to add to the premise the fact that the brother in law of the Walter White (Brian Cranston) is a lead DEA agent, and, in most regards, a pretty good one. Perhaps one of the only improbabilites of the first season is that this DEA agent comes so close to gathering evidence which implicates Walter, but he doesn't catch on.<br /><br />Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the story is seeing the extent to which people will do totally out of character things, things which are not only illegal (as one may think about drug business as a victimless crime), but violently illegal, including multiple murders. The acting by Cranston and Brian Paul, his \\"dealer\\" is superb, worthy of their Emmy wins. I must also give a good word for Raymond Cruz, who does a character far, far different from his police detective role on \\"The Closer / Major Crimes\\". The tension between his character Tuco and Walter White holds one's attention like little I've seen elsewhere.<br /><br />This is not for everyone, but watching one or two episodes shows why this one wins awards, and shows such as \\"White Collar\\", \\"Royal Pains\\", and \\"Suits\\" do not.
B000H7JD90|5.0|Purchased this item it arrived on time, also It was shipped and packaged very well. I am very happy with this product.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Wow. This book was probably one of the best books I've ever read. It was violent but pretty amazing. The ending was kind of strange. Over all it was AMAZING.
B001F12J48|2.0|The 3D effects were not quality. A lot of green, red and dark spots while watching the movie. I tried watching it with my expensive good quality glasses as well as the ones that came with it. Same thing with both. Disappointed...
B007N85POS|5.0|still learning to use my kindle, this app is so clear and fun to play.  Glade I got it. Fun
0307730697|5.0|This book is an example for how to live life to the fullest.  Adam's story is inspirational and motivating.  He overcomes any and every obstacle put in front of him.  Reading this book made me think, \\"I sure hope I am living my life in a way that people around me would say such nice things about me when I am gone.\\"  I liked this story so much I will be going up to his hometown to run in the 5k benefit run they have in his honor.  If this book doesn't move you in some way, see a medical doctor and a shrink.  I liked it so much I have purchased 5 other copies of it to give to other people.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Who wouldn't love Downton Abbey!  Maggie Smith makes this show, you never know what to expect next.  Can't believe how much I am looking forward to season 4!
0062082353|5.0|I read this book over my honeymoon.  I blazed through this book while laying on the beach for a week.  I could not put it down.  When the wife said, \\"Let's go lay on the beach\\" I jumped at the chance to read more.  This is a great read.  I loved reading this book because I was in Iraq at the same time Chris was there.  He also gets his wife involved in the book and she tells things from her perspective as well, a very very cool aspect of SEAL life that most books don't bring into account.  Stop reading this review and just buy the book already!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is one of the best Bond movies I've ever seen, and gives even more credibility to Craig as one of, if not, the, best Bonds ever. Don't miss this one.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love all mahjong games they are great and fun to do. If you like matching games this is the one to get.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|I always enjoy reading about how wealthy people think and this book did not disappoint.  He isn't going to win a pulitzer for his work but that's sort of the point.  It is raw and genuine and I had the impression that he wrote a lot of this off the cuff without going back over it and editing it numerous times.<br /><br />It isn't filled with self-help, motivational drivel but instead is a look into things he did to become successful.  It is a quick read and well worth the cost and time.
0385344228|5.0|I've been in law for over forty years and thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's both entertaining and educational. Mr. Landay's use of transcript testimony as part of the narrative was brilliant. Look forward to reading more from him.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|Its funny but it wasn't what I expected .I was hoping for more of a story I guess.It was a little disappointing.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|Oh yeah...the Scissor Sisters is the greatest with Jake Shears and his band of talented criminals!  They get better with every album and although I love their latest...it pales in comparison to their LIVE performances.  Their awesome music videos is the next best consolation...and THIS KIKI IS MARVELOUS!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved every minute of it, read it in two days.  Keep writing, please, your family will understand.  Thanks again. WRITE !!!!

0910226466|5.0|Many years ago, before the digital age, I directed a student abroad program taking college student both to Nepal and Tibet. I was teaching a course entitled \\"A Western Scientist Looks East\\". Over a period of some 15 years and some 20 trips I had taken as many as 200 students. Originally the course title was \\"the biophysics of high altitude physiology--a western scientist looks East\\" but over the years the course drifted more and more towards trying to understand Eastern Phiosophy. Living in Nepal it is simply not possible to not become completely enchanted with their Eastern culture, a culture that surrounds your every moment of the day and night. Although I had used a variety of books for my course my one constant companion was Hoff's magnificent book, \\"The Tao of Pooh\\". Recently I have just finished writing a new fun book, well a comic book, in which I have Aristotle reading \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" so I found my beat up copy in my old back pack. I had completely forgotten what a real joy it was to read that little book once more. It is a jewel of a book: a book for all ages.<br /><br />Igor Gamow<br />igor@gamow.com

B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is almost perfect but it updated about a month after the apple version so I cant play with my friends
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I cannot believe the number of 4 and 5 star reviews.  Something shady is going on.  Horrible book. Terrible writing. Characters are ridiculous, everyone does a lot of screaming-'come here,' he screamed. 'father!' he screamed.  'I told you,' he screamed.  Every warrior is huge, tree trunk legs, barrel chests.<br />Oh I can't go on.  Just awful story, writing, plot and characters.<br /><br />Do not trust the 4 or 5 star reviews!!
B005HIBWFW|5.0|Everyone involved in the arts, especially music, should see this movie - what an incredible struggle to be a composer, & not reep any of the benefits until after death.

B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy puzzles, and this puzzle game is okay, but it is really hard to move the pieces even with a kindle stylus.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Well designed with great graphics and color. Easily useable size. Especially like the way the last operation shows up under current one. Find myself hunting for Kindle just to use this free calculator. Was using one on my phone. Big- literally- improvement!!
1475143389|5.0|This book truly produces results. All of my lifts have increased in weight. Also the book does a great job at dispelling many myths that are pushed by the supplement companies. Matthews does a good job of giving the information you need to get results and has some great tips for making you stronger and more aesthetically pleasing quickly. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to obtain a better physique without using steroids.

0812992784|5.0|Book was in excellent condition as advertised.  I enjoyed the story and had always wondered how the fatwa affected Rushdie's life.  Very interesting although a little disconcerting that he used the third person, but at the same time it seems logical and better to write in the third person since he was telling the story of Joseph Anton.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|if she could she would always watch this show the program is clear and she enjoys it very much. .

B00ARN0XGG|2.0|the movie was not worth the money and I will not watch again but  such as life win some lose some.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Game works well. And, I enjoy the puzzles. It downloads easily and was well worth the price.  I have had other games from big fish before and all were professionally done.
B004SBX112|4.0|Lots of fun,  Great waste of time. Lots of challenging levels.  Like the holiday themes and costumes on the piggies

B0057A6GA6|1.0|No reasonable story, and far too easy. They give you so many resources to buy towers, there's no challenge. You have plenty of whatever you need to build everything, and to upgrade it all to max ability.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It gets the job done. For being mobile you can do anything you would need to on the go. I would recommend it.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Cute graphics, with an equally amusing, but shallow story. The on screen controls also work very well. Unlike other games, these controls are responsive.
B003S0IJWA|4.0|As is often if not always the case, subjectivity plays a big part in characterizing musical performances and, well, music itself. This set of Beethoven symphonies is not my favorite, and no single recording in this release is my favorite performance of any given work. Still, it's a fine Beethoven symphonic cycle and it is easily among my top ten and is able to claw its way close to the upper five, in fact. (My other favorites? In no particular order, since my mood changes, they include those conducted by Immerseel, Harnoncourt, Szell, Karajan, Cluytens and Bruggen.) As said or implied by other reviewers, these are classic, straightforward performances displaying in many if not most cases vigor and fire, and not weighed down by eccentricity or lethargy. The Fifth is especially good, and I'm one of those who really appreciates this version of the Third as well. My only sense of letdown was in the last portion of the Ninth -- the chorus didn't quite the bite and power I was hoping for. Other than that, it's all good. Add to this five overtures and an excellent performance of the Violin Concerto with Isaac Stern as soloist and you've got a very competitive but no frills boxed set.
B0038M61I2|1.0|This remaster is appalling. It completely ruins the music by boosting the bass to the point that it overpowers everything else.  Why do modern engineers assume everyone wants to listen exclusively to the bass? The bass is not what someone buys a Sonny Rollins CD for!  Edited to add - Just to be clear, I am referring to 2010 remaster by Joe Tarantino (ASIN B0038M61I2) in my review.

B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC be it tv, print or any other format is so wonderfully free of editorializing that, in our current &#34;news&#34; climate (or what passes for news in the U.S.) it is a true BREATH OF FRESH AIR!<br />Free of the &#34;fluff&#34; reporting that has destroyed t.v. news, BBC just tells the five ws':<br />who, what, when, where and how!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that it is a really good game for kids to play with and really cool.it is fun to be in the races.it is just a fun game I think .
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Nothing like a classic novel to cozy up to on a winter day! I have always loved this story, especially the movie! I am so happy this is on my Kindle instead of lugging the book around!
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Very important and novel ideas in the book, but for crying out loud he needs an editor. I understand that Taleb is something of a voice in the wilderness here, but saying something five times doesn't make it more true, just less likely to be read. Sometimes less is more.<br />It is ultimately worth the journey for sure to read and embrace these concepts, but I really could've read this in a quarter of the paper.

B009IAIC5I|2.0|I read some of the reviews about this, and how picture discs often suffer from bad audio quality.  But, I decided to reserve judgement and roll the dice.  Since the Iron Maiden clan have not seen fit to give us an audiophile release of these records on heavy black vinyl, this is pretty much the only option for a new record of these old recordings.  My copy of NOTB is unplayable.  Side 2 that begins with the song Number of the Beast, and the spoken word intro has so much surface noise that you CAN BARELY HEAR THE ACTOR'S VOICE!  I'm not joking.  It sounds like some serious swishing tunnel was added into the recording.  When the music kicks in, it really suffers from the surface noise, and the songs just sound like a big mess.  No punch, no power, no dynamics, just distortion.  Super disappointed.  In fact the quality is so poor, that I am reticent to sell it on ebay, and will probably try and trade it in at a local record store.  I can't return it to the store I bought it from.  That was on ebay from Canada, and I'm not going through that.  They didn't do anything wrong.  I blame IM for releasing sub par recordings.<br />I give it 2 stars because the packaging looks great, but if it's unlistenable, what good is it?
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I've edited my original review. Didn't realize I was reviewing the last movie, not the first! This was a great sequesl to the first three.  Hold on to your beer/pop and popcorn or you will be wearing them!<br />This movie has almost non-stop action throughout. As usual, the acting was surpurb. This series is the kind of movies that can almost convince you that it could really happen. Cant wait for #5 (Hopefully?)
B002I0J5FG|5.0|This will not be the typical review you're used to; i'm not going to discuss the plot, characters or controls. I'm writing this review in response to the negative reviews of this collection i've read here. I'm not going to bash people for genuinely not enjoying the game, because I understand that some people won't. This review will let you know what to expect when you first put the disc in the console.<br /><br />It seems as though (even a decade later) that people are picking up Ico or SoTC expecting an experience ENTIRELY different than the one the developers intended to provide. These games aren't necessarily about epic battles in amazing set pieces (although SoTC has plenty of them), or engrossing highly detailed plots, or even intricate fighting systems and controls. These games are about putting yourself in the situations the two main characters find themselves in, and without hesitation accepting that completely. You MUST suspend your comprehension of reality; do not think of it as playing a game, but as experiencing something new. Playing both games I often times found myself stopping for a second and saying \\"what am I doing?\\" or \\"what's my goal?\\". Sure, there are stories there; as in: \\"here's some general back story about what's going on... well off you go\\", and the developers kick you in the rear end and say \\"alright, now get to it\\". You don't know what the outside world is like - you don't know if it resembles anything you would recognize, or if it is just something completely different altogether. You are isolated, alone; left to your lonesome to piece together just what the hell this setting is and who the characters are. Yes, there are goals to complete, but that's not what pulled me in. Sure, you want to free this random little girl (Yorda) you found locked up in a cage in the castle you've been abandoned in, and yes, you want defeat all the colossi to bring another girl to life, but that's a means to the end. These games are about the experience, notthe actions.<br /><br />So this brings me back to the question i'd ask myself: \\"what am I doing, what's my goal?\\". I already gave the boring answer to that, but to me it's more than that. Whenever i'd ask that question, i'd get off of my horse in SoTC and just take in exactly what was going on: I was in the emptiness of vast expanses of cursed wilderness that had been locked up for many a years, fighting giant beasts to try to save a girl I knew nothing about - and it would hit me. Or i'd let go of Yorda's hand in Ico and take in what was going on: abandoned in a crumbling castle, i'm trying to escape with a girl, I again know relatively nothing about, while being chased by spirits seemingly under the command of a witch - and it would hit me again. Where else can I experience the feelings I felt in those circumstances? This is a one of a kind experience; it's not mindless drivel (which in itself can ALSO be fun), but something you have to accept and take in.<br /><br />This is why i'm writing this review. If you go in expecting a modern gaming experience that constantly rewards you with compliments and new upgrades, you're not going to enjoy this game at all. This isn't \\"Call of Battlefield 2: Grand Theft Halo\\", and that's not to take away from what those games have to offer, but this is different. The only way I can think of explaining it is intrinsically. These games have souls that differ from just about anything else in entertainment. It's not about rewarding the player with trophies and new items, or about making the player feel like an amazing warrior; it's about making the player feel REAL feelings. It's about connecting the players with a character they know next to nothing about, and letting them experience it on their own. It's nice to not be treated like an idiot and being repeatedly beaten over the head with everything cool the developers did.<br /><br />Please, give these games a chance. If you even consider the fact that gaming is an art, you owe it to yourself to play these games... And at around $20, it's almost stupid not to try. Just don't trash the game because it's not God of War or Call of Duty; it's not trying to be. You wouldn't call Shindler's List a bad movie because it doesn't make you laugh like Animal House, would you?
B00006D295|5.0|This is one of those Movies that you had to watch with a group of your friends when you were growing up - You know the kind I'm talking about - Like Ferris Bueller's day off, Tough Turf, Less than Zero, Risky Business, etc.<br />Nice to add to any collection of 70's and 80's Movie Classics.

0307887448|4.0|Have you ever wished you could concentrate all your pointless geek and fanboy knowledge into some productive or remunerative result? God knows I do, as someone having wasted my spirit in these pursuits, and Ready Player One must have taken shape from just such wish fulfillment fantasy on the part of its author, a true child of the 80s, like myself.  The story is a sort of nostalgic trip for anyone who grew up in that time period.  This is science fiction, but of a dystopian character like that of Huxley or Vonnegut, not the cheaper sort of space opera, but the incomparably neat premise allows for ton of space opera style guilty pleasuring.  The climax involves a fight between Voltron and Mechagodzilla--what more need be said?  By dystopian, I mean that this is extrapolative science fiction, of the \\"socially purposeful\\" variety, where the author takes one or more trends in contemporary civilization and asks \\"If this trend keeps up, it will ultimately lead to this....\\", thus showing us why it's bad or good.<br /><br />In Ready Player One, the premise is that in the not too distant future a grand new video game has been created by an eccentric programmer who has amassed a great fortune from his invention and died without issue.  The game is a virtual reality MMORPG(Everquest, Wow) that has subsumed the world of every other previous game and pop culture mythology(Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, etc.).  The games creator, Halliday, has created a hidden finding or secret within his game--an easter egg in the parlance--the finder of which will inherit his fortune and control of the game.  This premise is a meditation on the trend of our civilization for a large swath of the young adult population, 15 to 30 something, to spend large portions of our lives absorbed in MMORPGs, CCGs, console games, or simply generically the internet, these strange opiates of late modernity.  The urban myth of the couple who were so enthralled in WOW that they neglected their baby until it died comes to mind.  In this future dystopia, people literally live through the virtual reality, sometimes earning enough money never to leave their small cubicle in the real world(food is delivered).  In a subplot, it is revealed that modern debt slavery has evolved to the point where corporations literally capture and enslave persons in arrears!<br /><br />Anyhow, the story involves a series of puzzles the narrator must solve which involve athletic skill in arcade games and alternative pop culture knowledge of the 80s.  Here is where I found the book failed to live up to its premise somewhat, and I wish Ernest Cline had employed more craft in their execution.  The puzzles are all sort of cheap obscure references that have no real sense of inevitability or cleverness.  The short verses he creates for each of the \\"gates\\" are lifeless and totally unmemorable.  There is nothing to compare with Tolkien's famous riddles and poems here(one ring to rule them all, etc.).  A harsh comparison, I realize, but I feel Cline should have had the ability if he had burnt some midnight oil.  I would also point out that Acererak from Tomb of Horrors(qv) was not somebody(something) that could get up and play a video game.  He was just a skull on top of some dust.  Shows how superficial some of Cline's research must have been.<br /><br />Another point of criticism is that I am uncertain how original the book is.  While I have not yet read Snow Crash, I understand from word of mouth that much of its story is a similar interplay between a virtual reality world and the real world.  Ready Player One has a much different aim than Snow Crash as literature, of course.  Finally, I was most dismayed at the revelation of Aech's secret identity.  Cline is clearly simply trying to get his book made into a movie with this.  He could have spared us the sermonizing.<br /><br />In summary, Ready Player One is a breezy, somewhat informative read, filled with a lot of fun nostalgia and associations for a certain generation of people.  I'm not sure how much persons older or younger than myself might enjoy it.  If you've wasted more than 20 dollars in your lifetime trying to play the perfect game of Packman or Joust, then this book's probably for you!

1455869910|5.0|I picked it up because my fifteen-year-old daughter loves John Green.  From the first chapter, this novel took hold of me--and still hasn't let me go.  I don't think it ever will.  If you're inclined to take this book less seriously because it's &#34;Young Adult Fiction,&#34; well, let me put it this way: Tom Jones kisses Sophia in front of the mirror in Fielding's &#34;Tom Jones,&#34; Dorothea Brooke and Will Ladislaw kiss in Mr. Casaubon's library in George Eliot's &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; and Hazel Grace Lancaster kisses Augustus Waters in the attic of the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam in &#34;The Fault in Our Stars.&#34;  That kiss--and this novel--deserves to be mentioned in such literary company.  My God--what a love story!<br /><br />Virginia Woolf said &#34;Middlemarch&#34; was &#34;one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.&#34;  Change 'English' to 'American,' and the same goes for &#34;The Fault in Our Stars.&#34;  That the book also appeals to &#34;young adults&#34; is a testament to Mr. Green's gifts as a writer, as well as to the grown-up humanity of young adults.<br /><br />Kate Rudd's audio reading is also beautiful.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|A friend told me about this book and I immediately ordered it for my Kindle. Although my Faith in &#34;what is unseen&#34; is secure, I was interested to hear the points presented by a neurosurgeon. I know there are many opinions for and against the belief of life after death. I have read other articles written by survivors of near-death experiences and most of them have been positive. There have also been some really scary ones. Dr. Alexander's account of his experience is like none I had ever read before. The fact that his profession has a unique insight into the way the brain works and why lends particular credence to this book. I don't want to give away the book completely; but he used his knowledge of neurology and sought advice of others in his field to analyze and explore his miraculous experience. This book is SO interesting, I found it hard to put down.

B002GHHHKQ|4.0|If you can imagine \\"[[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]]\\" without the action you'd have a pretty good idea of \\"Contact.\\" Perhaps this is because they both hail from the late 90s (\\"Contact\\" came out the summer of '97 and \\"Armageddon\\" a year later). Toss in some elements of \\"[[ASIN:B00005JKHP Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]\\" and -- voila -- you have \\"Contact.\\" Not that it doesn't possess its own uniqueness, of course.<br /><br />The story has to do with an astronomer (Jodie Foster) finding conclusive radio evidence of extraterrestrial life. The intelligence -- whatever it is -- then sends data on how to meet, but only one person can go.<br /><br />Foster's character is an atheistic scientist while her romantic interest in the story believes in God (Matthew McConaughey). The respectful tension of these two mindsets in the face of extraterrestrial contact is interesting and the filmmakers do a good job of maintaining a balance between the two, rather than advocating one above the other. Generally speaking, science and religion both pursue truth (the way it really is) but their methods differ, science stresses empirical evidence whereas religion looks to faith and love. Why can't we embrace both? (What a revolutionary idea!)<br /><br />Both vantage points are portrayed by people who are genuine and honest about their pursuit of truth. Between them is the character of David Drumlin (played excellently by Tom Skerritt) who is driven by selfish ambition and therefore willing to put on airs to attain his goals. But corruption comes at a price.<br /><br />The film is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name. The balance in the film between fact and faith, atheism and belief can be attributed to Sagan's spiritual agnosticism. He rejected the arrogance of atheism and has stated: \\"Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.\\" Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries. The movie conveys this.<br /><br />The film runs two and a half hours.<br /><br />GRADE: Bears and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.\\" Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|For whatever reason, it seems that movies based on video games almost universally fail on some level -- they either fail to be a true adaptation of the original game, they bomb at the box office, or some combination of both.  Is there some fundamental difference between video games and films that makes it ultimately impossible to adapt a video game to the big screen, or is it just a case of the filmmakers not caring?  Even films that are simply about video games, such as \\"The Wizard,\\" tend to be lackluster.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph,\\" while not an adaptation of any specific video game, manages to break the losing streak.  This may be the best video-game movie by a long shot, if not one of the best animated films of 2012.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" stars the titular Ralph, villain of an old arcade game called \\"Fix-It Felix Jr.\\"  Tired of being hated, feared, and ignored as a bad guy, Ralph sets out to prove he can be a hero by winning a medal in another game in the arcade.  His journey takes him first to the first-person-shooter world of \\"Hero's Duty,\\" then to the candy-coated racing game \\"Sugar Rush,\\" all the while pursued by Felix, the hero of his own game, and Calhoun, a tough and cynical soldier from Hero's Duty.  Ralph eventually befriends Vanellope, a \\"glitch\\" character from Sugar Rush, and agrees to help her gain recognition as a true video game character, only to uncover a darker side to the saccharine racer game... and inadvertantly bring a villain from Hero's Duty to Sugar Rush.  And in the end, it may be up to a villain and a glitch to set things right.<br /><br />First of all, don't be too fooled by the cover -- characters such as Sonic, Dr. Eggman, Q*bert, and M. Bison have only cameos in this film (though Q*bert does actually help get the plot rolling).  Still, it's rather fun to watch the movie and find all the references, both obvious and subtle, to classic and popular video games.  Even two of the major games in the film are obvious homages to real games (Fix-It Felix Jr. bears a strong resemblance to Donkey Kong, and Hero's Duty looks like a combination of Call of Duty and Halo).<br /><br />The world of the film itself is brilliantly realized -- each game is its own little world, with power cords connecting each game like an electronic train system (surge protectors serve as terminals), and there's an internal set of rules to this digital universe that makes sense.  Each game also has its own unique look, whether it's the retro, pixellated look of older games such as \\"Fix-It Felix,\\" slickly high-resolution and gritty games such as \\"Hero's Duty\\" (as gritty as a PG movie will allow, at least), or over-the-top sugary and cutesy like \\"Sugar Rush.\\"  And if you've ever wondered what a first-person shooter or game code looks like from inside the game, this movie provides a clever visualization of both.<br /><br />The characters, too, are fun to get to know.  Ralph, despite technically being a villain, is adorable, and it's hard not to empathize with his desire to just be liked and accepted.  Felix, as the hero of a kid's game, is rather hilariously innocent, and actually quite a likeable character -- it would have been too easy for the filmmakers to turn him into the movie's antagonist and make him an ego-driven jerk, but thankfully they avoid that cliche.  Vanellope starts out annoying, but it's hard not to empathize with her desire to fit in and be seen as something other than a \\"mistake.\\"  And Calhoun, though she falls into the cliche of the battle-hardened soldier with a dark past, manages to be enjoyably snarky, and seems to realize just how out of place she is in the cutesy world of Sugar Rush.<br /><br />This film works on quite a few levels.  It's an enjoyable kids' film (though some moments might be too scary for very young viewers), with enough clever humor and action for adults to be entertained as well.  It's also a loving tribute to retro arcade games, and contains quite a few in-jokes that hardcore gamers will appreciate.  And it also works as a sort of \\"spiritual successor\\" to the Toy Story films -- in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it inhabits the same universe, seeing as its concept, of playthings coming to life in the absence of humans, is quite similar.<br /><br />Wonderful family film, with some friendly nods to the retro and modern gamer crowd.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />P.S.  The theater run of this film included a black-and-white animated short called \\"Paperman,\\" a sweet and lighthearted cel-shaded CGI feature that's effectively told without dialogue or any color save a hint of red lipstick.  I'm thrilled to see that this will be included in the DVD release.mers will appreciate.

The theater run of this film included a black-and-white animated short called \\"Paperman,\\" a sweet and lighthearted cel-shaded CGI feature that's effectively told without dialogue or any color save a hint of red lipstick.  I'm thrilled to see that this will be included in the DVD release.

B00846F1YW|3.0|This was a great game. The objects were hidden well, and it gave you a good amount of time to find them all. When I got to a level where you had to find business cards, I had found all of the cards except for one and then proceeded to use my hint to find the last one. The hint showed the card to be hidden behind the countdown timer. This bothered me, as I wasn't able to tap on the last business card and complete the level. I'm not sure if other people are having this problem, as I have the original Kindle Fire, and other tablets may have bigger screens, making it so that you can tap on the business card. Other than that, this was a great game with a quirky psychic twist. I got this app as the FAOTD, I would NOT pay $2.99 for this game though. It seems a little pricey for what it is.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The movie starts out slowly, in my opinion, with glimpses into Bilbo’s life the day of his birthday party in the Shire (the day he gives Frodo the ring) before flashing back some 60+ years to his first meeting with Gandalf and the chaos that followed. I thought the scenes of dwarven partying in Bilbo’s house were excessively drawn out (and maybe, I was cringing–as most mothers do–at the thought of the amount of cleaning up that had to follow.) If there was a relationship that Gandalf had with Bilbo prior to the escapade, it must have escaped me. It felt odd that Gandalf would shoehorn Bilbo (practically a stranger to him) into an adventure for which he was obviously unprepared and unwilling to undertake, unless there were some rumblings of fate or destiny.<br /><br />Me, personally, I would have stayed home, but Bilbo dashes off to follow the dwarves and embarks on an unexpected adventure (heck, “journey” is too mild a term to describe all that follows.) The dwarves, led by Thorin, the dwarven prince, are intent on reclaiming their mountain home from a dragon. (If I were going to fight a dragon, I would have brought along way more than 13 people, just saying…) The merry band runs into orcs, trolls, and a veritable gamut of Middle Earth’s flora and fauna (most especially the ones that are large enough and mean enough to kill you.) Through it all, one thing stuck out: Gandalf is unquestionably the personification of deus ex machina. The dwarves get into trouble with the trolls…Gandalf shows up. The dwarves get into trouble with the orcs…Gandalf shows up. The dwarves get into trouble with more orcs…Gandalf shows up.<br /><br />It was enough to make you roll your eyes, but the action was rip-roaring fun anyway, so you could almost forgive the novelist and the script writer for it. The one thing I never understood about this movie (or about The Lord of the Rings) was why the giant eagles wouldn’t just carry you to your destination and drop you off in front of it as opposed to dropping you off in the middle of nowhere and expecting you to walk the rest of the (long, long) way.<br /><br />Bilbo acquits himself admirably. Over the course of the movie, he becomes less of a nuisance and much more of a hero, winning Thorin’s respect and gratitude. All in all, the stakes in the movie appear to be much less world-changing than The Lord of the Rings (though I’m sure Thorin would disagree with me) but the undercurrents of change run through the entire movie, not the least of which, Bilbo finds the one Ring in Gollum’s cave.<br /><br />As for the characters, the dwarves started to blend together. I recognized a few easily (Thorin, Balin, Fili, and Kili) but the rest were a blur of beards. There were elves, though not enough, and there was no Legolas (Sigh…for that I think I’ll deduct a half star.)<br /><br />In hindsight, The Hobbit was a fun movie. It wasn’t quite like The Fellowship of the Ring where my immediate instinct after the movie was to pay for another ticket and watch it again. In this case, I can hold off on my second viewing of The Hobbit until it comes out on DVD as a trilogy (because as we all know, boxed sets are cheaper), and even then, I suspect, I won’t be as compulsive about seeing it again and again as I am with The Lord of the Rings. Yes, the movie is rife with fights with orcs and trolls, but taken as a whole, there is much less emotional tension and conflict in the story (or at least it seems a bit more trite compared to that in The Lord of the Rings.)<br /><br />I’d rate it 4.5 stars (minus a half star for not putting Orlando Bloom on the screen somewhere.)in front of it as opposed to dropping you off in the middle of nowhere and expecting you to walk the rest of the (long, long) way.<br /><br />Bilbo acquits himself admirably.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Mr. King, you have done it again!  This book captivated me as it covered so much information that I remember from my childhood, hearing of the assination of President Kennedy.  Weaving the history with such a great storyline makes for a great read.
B000000OR9|5.0|During the late 80's the clutter of  glam bands started to become overwhelming. In fact many bands were labeled glam and weren't really to it and so it was hard for many bands to be taken serious. and with the near rise of grunge on the horizon many amazing band's didn't get enough credit and the cream of the crop in my opinion was Blue murder. And was John Sykes first attempt at singing and being a front man. And boy does he do a great job along with writing some of the meanest riffs of the late 80's How he sang and played live i have no clue. Showing just how much of an influence his riff writing had and Whitesnake 87 .Along with Carmine Appice drumming and Tony Franklin's fretless bass playing which adds a whole new dimension of Melody. And the songs Have the typical 80's metal vibe to them typically rather straight forward then branch off and weave in and out. So in a way it's very different yet very true to form. Now stop reading this and Get the CD!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Such a pleasure to have this CD and to find it at such a great price. Thanks for a great selection of products!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun, but I keep having to get more things and everything disappeared. I think the things should really stay because I always lose them.

B007REV4YI|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie in theaters. I'd rank it #2 out of all the 23 official movies. Perfect pacing, excellent classic throwbacks, and a driven plot, all with traditional Bond flair. A free iTunes copy was a great bonus too.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm 50+ with many years workout experience and I have read more than a few books like this one.  Mike sifts thru the BS from soup to nuts on being all you can be body/health-wise and gives a clear concise &#34;howto&#34; and &#34;whatto&#34; and &#34;don'tdo&#34; for efficient workouts and eating habits.  I've never been fully shredded but now I know what I've been either missing or doing wrong in my regimen.  I'm 95% in sync with Mike's philosophies on all pillars in this book. Highly recommended for beginners and for intermediate muscleheads like me.

B009YQJ322|4.0|An exciting and gritty movie.  It deserved better than it received at the box office.  Certainly, it is head and shoulders above the Sylvester Stallone film of the 1990s.

159562015X|3.0|The book was advertised as new and unused.  The book I received was used because the authorization code for online assessment of my strengths was previously used.  Therefore, the book does not meet my expections of being able to take a strengths assessment online.  However, the book has excellent information and I recommend the book, just not the one I received.
0553801473|1.0|I waited eleven years for some of these characters, between A Storm of Swords and this novel, after the horrific mistake of removing half of the character stories from A Feast for Crows. Although I don't think that Crows was as bad as the average fan says, it suffered from pacing issues and having too few characters on which to focus. I would imagine even George recognizes now what an insipid idea it was to change the format of the series, mid way through. That isn't done for a reason, and we saw why; it didn't work, and the fans hated it.<br /><br />So fast forward to the long awaited Dance with Dragons. GRRM spent a third of the book trying to rush us up to speed. The book required a brief intro from GRRM attempting to explain the format. Again, why was the split ever made?<br /><br />Dragons was rubbish. I mean, garbage. From the overuse of certain words (poor editing), to the incessant pointlessness of whole story lines (again, where is the editor?), to the destroying of Tyrion as the series's most interesting character (I didn't think that possible), down to the cesspool that is Daenerys' chapters. Why does she even exist any more?<br /><br />I'm also not sure why Sansa, Brienne and Samwell weren't in this book, and yet Quentyn Martell had endless pages of nothingness devoted to his vapid existence. We follow his painfully dull journey from one continent to the other.. and he dies. And the world is impacted in no way. Again, what was the point? His existence did not move the story forward one bit. And what was with the endless torture of Theon, turning him into a disgusting, deformed creature that we feel empathy for? An odd turn I thought. But far less objectionable than much of the rest of the book.<br /><br />I think the first three books in the series were brilliant. The fourth is slower, yes, but perhaps the best written. The war had ended, and many fans were expecting more action, but it's an examination of the hell that wars creates. It's a thoughtful piece, and I've read it twice, enjoying it both times.<br /><br />Dance? Dance is just horrid. I struggled to finish it, and will never go near it again. Eleven years is a long time for any author, and GRRM clearly is having difficulty keeping everything together. By his own admission, the series was only supposed to be three novels, and this world that he created twenty years ago is now far larger and more unwieldy than he ever intended.<br /><br />And it shows.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love both of the tempe run games. Temple run 2 is the same but different everything is harder but not to hard. I really hope there will be a temple run 3!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and so entertaining!!! My little sister started playing this game(and always seemed to have a lot of fun) so I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did because this game rocks. It may be even better than temple run.
B00AFOS6QG|1.0|Nick Cave and his Bad Seeds have produced some monumental albums - Your Funeral My Trial, Tender Prey, The Good Son, Let Love In.  But somewhere around Nocturama the wheels started getting all wobbly.  It happens in a career of this length.<br /><br />Blixa Bargeld left.  Jim Sclavunos started taking over the drum seat from Thomas Wydler.  Then the final nail... longtime songwriter/arranger Mick Harvey left.  Cave was now writing mostly with Warren Ellis, and while they've produced some great soundtracks, I just don't like the direction they've gone.  Not only has the personnel completely turned over, the sound has very little to do with the golden years of the Bad Seeds, when even the ballads had a sense of malice and brooding danger bubbling beneath the surface.<br /><br />The last 10 years just seem to be riding on the fumes of past glory, and what's amazing is they're more successful than ever!  Just goes to show...

B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I love Courtney Milan books. I enjoyed all of her &#34;Un-&#34; series (Unchained, Unraveled, Unclaimed, etc&#34; and I really enjoyed &#34;The Governess Affair&#34;, so much so that I was waiting anxiously for the Brothers Sinister series. That should explain to you just how disappointed I was by opening this book to find that Robert, Duke of Clermont, is possibly the most boring character in the history of romance. He's unrealistically naive and hopeful with conflicting amounts of sexual prowess (there's an insistence that the first time with his new wife be &#34;special&#34; and &#34;different&#34;, however since he's a virgin, one would assume there could be nothing &#34;different&#34; to compare against.) He also talks about those same acts and what could be possible a fair amount, and in crude ways, long before they happen, which is confusing when he turns out to be clueless about them later.<br /><br />The characters don't quite flush out, though not for a lack of trying, each simply ends up being SO very dynamic, they're walking contradictions instead of understandable and/or likable. If this had been the writing of an author I was unfamiliar with, I'd have tossed the book ages ago, as it is, I'm shocked and still trying to finish the last quarter of the book in hopes that &#34;A Kiss for Midwinter&#34; might be better.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|I have always loved this movie but the only time I ever seem to want to purchase it is during the Christmas holiday when it is sold out because of how good of a movie it is.<br /><br />So, I used my Prime membership and purchased it as a digital copy.

B008BOWH1W|5.0|I'm extremely pleased with this live album, it's dramatic and beautiful. I've also gotten the DVD set of the performance and it's fabulous. I reckon the breakup with Nightwish has served Tarja very well, and she's become a powerful star in her own right. I like it that she's a strong woman. She's matured as a metal artist, and is definitely better off now that she's no longer hampered by her last band (who seem to like to keep women in their place - being sassy, but then I just heard they gave Anette the boot, so I hope Anette can do a Phoenix like Tarja did. :P). Hats off to Tarja, she has a talent for composing, and a flair for lyrical/emotional melodies. Based on her compositions, I can't help but wonder how much Nightwish's repertoire benefited from her creative input. Tarja has continued to expand the atmosphere of music that I enjoyed in Nightwish's earlier albums. Nowadays her ex band Nightwish has steered more into symphonic metal soundtrack music with some folksie vocal rock pop, while Tarja has amazingly managed to preserve the magic of Nightwish before they changed direction. I suppose her classical background is a huge plus, and hopefully she keeps creating metal music with lots of energy and passion. I follow both bands, and will continue to track them both as a fan. They're no longer part of a shared vision, and I suppose that means more for us. I wish them both the best of luck. If Tarja tours the USA, I'll definitely try to go.

B00BESIKWM|3.0|This movie has been poorly reviewed by critics but I think the \\"professionals\\" tend to take horror films too seriously when the intent is merely to entertain. Yes the story is lacking and there are continuity issues from the first Silent Hill, but this is typical for this type of movie. If you like the dark fantasy associated with supernatural horror films and have a reasonable expectation for the genre than you will probably enjoy this feature.
0988262592|1.0|I could not get any useful information out of this book. I believe it is supposed to be realistic, but it completely fails in being so. The story is silly and sounds manufactured...as if put together by somebody who has never worked in corporate America, nor in a decent-size IT department. It was really a waste of time and I regret having purchased it.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, great fun.  I know it was panned by the critics so I knew this would be a great flick to have a copy of.  It is entertaining and great escapism.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read the book because I had seen the movie and liked it.  So I figured I'd like the book more since books are usually better than their movie versions.  Overall...movie good, book better.  But if you've already seen the movie you run the risk of marring your opinion of it slightly since the books story made more sense to me of being better in line with the who the characters are and how they relate to each other.  It made the Hollywood deviations seem like attempts to make it flashier and more suspenseful, but that is their spiel I'm not at all surprised.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Lots of fun !!!<br />There is and are strategy to the larger prizes.'. Used to unlock a different prizes +all ages my 3 yr old liked it Too
B005LS5M2M|5.0|I thought this was a really fun movie. I think it was faithful to the overall mythos of &#34;Green Lantern&#34;. My only critique would be of the Parallax entity. I thought it looked nothing like it does in the comic books. I wasn't really fond of the idea that the Parallax was a fallen Guardian of the Universe. The sub plot with STAR LABS and Dr. Weller isn't really elaborated on. Overall a pretty fun movie. I would definetly like to see a sequel.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am so happy I found this game. I love working puzzles but do not have the room for it in my house.
B007REV4YI|5.0|For myself, I thought this was the best of the three Daniel Craig James Bond vehicles. It was pretty action packed. It makes up for the disappointments in &#34;Casino Royale&#34; and &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34;. I thought it got back on track with what the James Bond Franchise is all about: Action, Women, and Wit.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|These movies are a wonderful \\"romp\\", which I don't think one should take too seriously, as that was the intent of the producers, directors and stars. All four movies look and sound good enough to enjoy on good home entertainment  gear.<br /><br />You know the movies, so there's no need to discuss those details any further. In my opinion, the Nazi villain movies are better than the non-Nazi villains. If you loved them, as I still do, they are wonderful, and I actually found more to enjoy in the second film (Temple of Doom) -- always loved the start of that movie, but felt it trailed off.<br /><br />Color transfer appears uniformly good on a 51-inch Plasma picture, and sound is adequately loud and clear on TFX Certified surround sound equipment. Special effects, while appropriate to the vintage of the movies, are far more \\"noticeable\\" in the older movies -- the first two. Last Crusade and Kingdom of Skulls, especially, show how far CGI has advanced.<br /><br />I didn't find the included special features (which if you've got older DVD sets, you probably already own) to increase the enjoyment of the movies. The video quality of the special features is not very good, and looks it on modern video equipment. That said, IMO, the set's a bargain for HD television, but you probably won't use it to show off your equipment to your friends. Nonetheless, I recommending getting some popcorn and ordering some pizza, and inviting some good friends (old and young) over to watch these movies. They just seem to go better in an audience, as they were made to be seen.<br /><br />Video - A-<br />Sound - A<br />Special Features - C
034547581X|5.0|I read this book during college. I thought it was quite fascinating. It really explored not only the battle itself but, it also gave a lot of background information on the Vietnam War itself. I would reccomend it to anyone enrolled in Army ROTC or a Cadet at USMA West Point.

Brilliant lyrics, hugest slammin' guitar sound ever, and incredibly great anthemic melodies. More was never done with less.<br /><br />I know this page combines many versions of the record, but this page is for the DELUXE Edition, mates. Thanks to Amazon we don't get a picture of the contents, so what's on the 2nd disc???? Your guess is as good as mine. Could someone who has the bleedin' DELUXE version list the contents of both CDs and give us some perspective on the sound quality???? What---you think I'm gonna say \\"Please\\"??? Crimey.....

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such a touching and moving story. I could hardly put it down! Pat Peoples is one of the most endearing protagonists ever written. You cannot help but root for him. Read this book!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|It seems to be a major trend in publishing to push everything as a trilogy, and it's a trend I understand; after all, it makes everyone more money, and you can't fault an author for having a story that spans multiple books. What I can fault an author for, though, is creating a book that doesn't stand satisfactorily on its own, and instead feels like little more than a buildup for the next book in the series. Unfortunately, that's the case with A Discovery of Witches, which creates a really rich, intriguing world, sets up lots of rules and histories, gets ready to set them all into motion...and then ends just as things are about to get started. That's a frustrating way to open a series, and it's hard to get motivated to keep going when the first volume feels like nothing but setup. And that's kind of a shame, because Harkness has created a pretty compelling, rich, and inventive world. There's almost a sense that this is Twilight done right; while there are a lot of elements that feel lifted from that world (most notably a vampire lover who is enchanted by our heroine's scent to the point of near-madness), Harkness explores them in a lot more depth and complexity, creating a rich history to her world and interweaving it wonderfully with real history and events. Like Twilight, though, the hero and heroine are almost impossibly perfect; our heroine seems to be capable of just about anything, while our hero has met anyone who's anyone in history and is perfect in every way. It's the rough edges that really make the book work, from one of the vampire's close friends to a wonderful stint in a house with a mind and personality all its own. I don't doubt that the second volume of the series is solid; Harkness has done enough prep work here to get things moving, and the characters and world she's created are rich ones with plenty of room to explore. But when the first volume of a series isn't a satisfying entry on its own terms, it's hard to get motivated to keep moving along..
B004GHNIRK|1.0|boring couldn't see wasting anymore of my time reading it, couldn't grasp where the book was heading to.<br />Just aweful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this show has me very entertained and I hate that it is going to end and I hate to wait for the next season
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I think the family should have invested in lights and electricity. I think they only used batteries or a portable generator for limited lighting and power. The movie is very dark, as in hard to see kind of dark. If I was scared at night I would definitely turn on a light or two. The darkness does add atmosphere but this movie is almost always dark. Did I say it was dark? It is so dark that even in the day shots you are lucky if you can make out more than a silhouette. I literally thought something was wrong with my computer because you just cannot see more than about 25% of the screen most of the time.<br />Good performances and some very creepy moments. If you like the supernatural ghosts and the like, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />++2/3'ds of the way into this movie I went from 4 stars to 3 stars. I am so tired of not being able to see anything but barely lit actors and sets. Yes, it is the darkness of the film, and yes, it does get to be too much.
B004159Y98|4.0|This album is one of my favorites. It's soothing and sometimes a bit sad but this is one of his best records.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|good movie good services enjoyed the movie kep putting off getting this movie now dont know way i take so long
B00B2V66VS|5.0|First for you Temple Run 2 lovers looking at my title saying &quot;Why isn't it saying 100%??!!&quot;. Well nothing is perfect. I love the game! It will have some flash freezes but otherwise amazing!!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This cover leaked and is separating on the gasket seam. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I think this is a knock off of the original LP CASE.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|kept me very interested. some areas where challenging but nice to have the hints. loved havuing miles as a help.
B0086213XW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  The lead actress is suffering from melancholia.  I always wondered what it would be like to be depressed.  Michelle Williams helps you<br />see for yourself.  There are hysterical laughs along the way.  The pool scene with the Richard Simmons act-alike. Then there was deep spiritual romance<br />another pool scene.  Wow!  This movie takes deep thought but it is more than it seems on several levels.  If you expect entertainment....you might be<br />disappointed, but if you watch it without expectation you will find substance.  You'll find what she was searching for:  laughter, joy, connection and love.<br />Michelle Williams is one talented actress.  Sarah Silverman (I love her because she is a liberal Democrat)  Seth Rogen was good too.  Savor this movie.
B0054N73EY|5.0|I buy only a select amount of full cds. I try to save it for the really good ones. I am so happy I chose this one. It rocks!!!! The Chilli Peppers never cease to amaze me. Just when you think they cant get much BETTER than they already are, they DO!<br />!!!! They continue to inspire me on so many levels.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I suspected that is how this one would end.  The story is a good read. I especially like the first-person perspective in how it is told. At least I don't need to wait for the third movie to find out what happens as I will be starting book three shortly!
B002NXSRVG|4.0|When I saw the trailer with the power-suits running through traffic, it turned me off. Because it didn't look like GI JOE. It looked like a teenage boy thing--which is what I suppose GI JOE is supposed to be--plus throw in stuff for us old timers that actually saw the cartoons and read the comics back in the day.<br /><br />The movie thankfully keeps itself PG-13 where it should be and just has fun. There are a ton of characters in it and so the scripting is actually pretty good considering. There are lots of connections here--like, why are they blasting through Paris? Well, it was the French that made Destro, and his decendent wanted revenge. The little and the big are all wrapped up neatly. Throw in unexpected fun moments like Bendan Fraser as a JOE, some great lines (\\"Nice shoes.\\"), and a great character triangle with Duke, the Baroness and Cobra Commander, and as a whole the movie just works. This is a good, solid update to the franchise.<br /><br />Why did I give it a chance? Well, I saw the preview for the next GI JOE movie--and it's supposed to have Bruce Willis as the original JOE. Are you kidding? That was reason enough for me to give this film a chance. It stands well on it's own and I can't wait for the next installment.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Looking forward to reading this because I enjoyed the movie so much. I knew nothing about this show before I went.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you liked the first one, you'll probably enjoy round 2 as well. This game is more fun if others you know are playing it and you all can compete. This also helps deals with the repetitive nature of the game.
068981528X|5.0|Okay, so obviously this is not the story we read as kids growing up but it is a great story none the less. Its a great book for kids and the adults that are still kids at heart :)<br /> The moral of the story is a strong work ethic, persistence and forgiveness which are winning character qualities that get you through the game called life...something all kids and some adults need to learn.<br /> If your kid is 3rd grade or younger there will be a few new words they learn when they read the book. Pneumatic Hammer is my favorite :)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'd watched Tina Fey on SNL and thought I knew a lot about her.  However, Tina's honest and funny story of her life made me admire her even more.  From the 'lousy dates' to the self doubt, she is so relateable.  It is so inspiring to see a woman excel in what was considered a man's world, comedy.  Way to go girl!
0817439390|5.0|Fantastic book.  I like how the author explained a topic and then gave a homework assignment to practice what was explained.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who wants improve their skills in taking Photos.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was , at times, tiresome and at other times , disturbing on many levels. And yet, when all is said and done,it's a story of courage in the face of unthinkable hardship. It is truly a story of the triumph of the human spirit!
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Love this Album! Great music created by amazing artist. Can't wait for their next one.<br />Shout out to another Ohio band, Strangers To Wolves. EP will be released March 4th.

B007REV4T8|5.0|The writer of Skyfall is commended for his/her work.  This story is the best most believable one ever.  You get the action-packed 007 we have all grown up with plus new characters that will become endearing as the series continues.  The loss of one character is very sad to see; I only hope the new one can take her place & do it justice.  The personal story of 007 is compelling & brings to light why 007 is the man he is.  The scenes are beautiful, action-packed & stays true to the excitement you expect from 007.  I didn't like Daniel Craig in the beginning but he is to me now the best BOND since Sean Connery.  WOW!  I recommend this movie highly!!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Loved this movie.  Very unique point of view,  however there are a lot of traumotized punks in America, but there are not too many movies that show their pained lives.  Very good acting of Rooney Mara, the rape scene was very authentic and I loved the tattooing schene, he deserved it.  However, the actor Daniel Craig could have been substituted with a better and a younger actor, not so seasoned.  But anyways, thank  you for the frank portrayal of the subject.  I recomend this movie to every troubled teen.  It is a good terapy

Hope I will find a partner who could satisfy me as the book caracters satisfied each other.  Thank you for bringing in this subject in the book!
B004SDEP38|5.0|does as it says,  easy install works easy no issues.  Love the apps from Amazon and the price is right.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|This was the ending of a very exciting series, the most convoluted story I have ever seen or read. It has flash forwards and flashbacks. It was diffilcult to follow in that you had to pay attention all the time. But it is a very interesting story and well worth the time to watch it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Was a bit hard to find out how to search. But once you find out where the search button hides all is well.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was a great book. I like all of John's books about law and lawyers, and crooks or prisoners. He always keeps you in suspence.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the book and I'd read it again. She left an abusive marriage and found happiness and finally found a man who truly loved her.
1932100660|5.0|I'm still reading this book, but so far, I love it. I am a vegan and loving it. I am doing self-studies because my major is Nutritional science, so I  hope to learn as much as a I can through reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A must read for any science fiction fan. It's a great post apocalyptic story with some very good characters. Wish there was more!
B003Y5H574|5.0|I'm happy. Can't complain about the quality of the movie. Dvd came on time. Never fails to meet my expectation.
0525478817|5.0|This is a hard book to read if you know of a teen who is facing cancer.  The don't all live &#34;happily ever after.&#34;<br />But I loved it as a tool to better understand my son.
B00AEQYM6S|1.0|I found the singing on this cd dull to listen to. I found the voice characterless, possessing a hard, metallic tone.<br /><br />I came away with the impression this singer is serving himself rather than a servant of the music. I was left totally unmoved.<br /><br />Great singers have a unique, individualistic sound in which one can instantly recognise who is singing: Kollo, Windgassen, Mödl. Janowitz.<br /><br />Check out Domingo's Tristan, if you want a really great Italianate Wagner experience.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|This cd arrived just in time for it to be A Christmas present to my son. It arrived in perfect conditon. My son is very pleased and sayshank you very much, and i look forward to doing buisness with you again
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game!  Seems easy, but you do have to plan your next move to advance through the game.  Great way to pass time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the story. It is one of the best romance book I ever read.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It appears you should never go to Vegas and have too much to drink because you will end up married to someone you don't remember!  or at least not remember well.  It was well written and had some interesting twists in their relationship.  Worth the read!
B007REV4YI|4.0|This is a very good Bond.  Daniel Craig is my favorite because he's so active/athletic.  I did like Casino Royale better than Skyfall.  The ending was very surprising.  Worth the purchase and price is great.  Adding it to my library.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Wonderful book which I found hard to put down.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and found the pictures helped with the believability.
B00881VLCE|5.0|it was terrible had to download and give it 5 stars  to get a different app played for a little while it sucked
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Good learning tool.  My 4 year old loves it.  One of the few apps that we let him play for any length of time.  BTW, I love it too and it is a great learning tool to develop familiarity with musical instruments.

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Lots of thought-provoking examples and ideas to grow on.  I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to anyone who interacts with others.
B00005KHJV|5.0|I'm a huge Halloween fan, and I've only ever seen the tv scenes as like extras. I've never seen them incorporated into the film. It was pretty awesome, though, you can tell they kinda don't belong in the movie. The 3 actresses(Curtis, Soles, and Loomis) in particular look 3 years older, because as you may or may not know the tv scenes were shot 3 years later during the filming of Halloween II. Also, one complaint I have is the first few minutes, when Michael is killing Judith, the sounds seems off. Like you hear her body hit the floor, before we see it. So, that's a little annoying. I liked it very much overall, though. Halloween is a horror classic, and the tv secens incorporated made it 10 minutes longer, so, that's great.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|One of the greatest games ever made...have played every FF title and this game proves that each and every one should be made for android...Please continue to release the other games.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is a rip off. I have paid for games and not recover them. There customer service did not seem to want to help at all. PLEASE BE AWARE OF BUFFALO STUDIOS!!

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is perfect.The age of apps right now is pretty crummy.This game is totally different.la la sorry needed more words
B0087HT36U|4.0|passes the time, like a version of angry birds, somewhat.  Worth playing, but need more levels, but it is worth a look.  will continue to wait for new levels if nothing else to play.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|Interesting, yet confusing at the same time and this book definitely is a book I would consider telling people about.
B008220C38|3.0|I received this movie today and just watched it.  I haven't decided whether or not I like it.  Anna Karenina is one of my favorita works of literature, and I have read it many, many times.  The transitions between the families, which can seem a little choppy in the book, are brilliantly and creatively done in the movie.  I really love some of the scene tranisitions that move the story along.  Though I was a little taken aback by the beginning of the movie that explains the background to the problem in the Oblonsky household, I decided as the movie progressed that I really like this unique set up to the story line.  I think Keira Knightly and Jude Law portrayed Anna and Vronsky perfectly.  Really, all of the actors were very well chosen and well portrayed.  I know the novel is very long, however, I am disappointed at several of the scenes that were left out.  The lack of background for Levin's revelation at the end really leave's it hollow and making no sense.  Many parts of it feel rushed with no explanation.  If you haven't read the novel, many parts would not make any sense.  It would just be a series of scenes with no background and no connection.  If these characters had been able to fully act out all of the important scenes of the book in the creative style that was implemented in this movie, I would have been highly impressed.  However, I don't think I could have handled listening to that same waltz over and over again for the amount of time it would have taken to watch all of those scenes.  The waltz is an important theme to the story, but really, the same tune over and over again gets to be a bit annoying after awhile, especially when it's a waltz.  I would have loved to have seen Vronsky's country house though or his painting of Anna in Italy or Kitty's trip abroad or the wedding scene or the summer at Levin's house before Kitty has the baby.
1451662432|5.0|This book has changed my life.  Not only that, I would have to say it is the book that has most changed my life.  It was just an extraordinary piece of writing and advice and look at a life that leaves you looking at your own life.  I didn't want to like it.  I read his first book and since he cheated on his wife I didn't want to like this book, but his writing is just so engaging that I really enjoy it so I set out to read it.  I also come from a place that nobody's perfect and people come as packages and you can't just pick and choose what you get, you get the whole deal.  I also finish about one book for every ten books I start.  If I finish the book, I loved it.  From the first word I was completely engaged in this book.  I grew to really admire him and really wish I could just sit down and talk to him just like he likes to with people he admires.  I wanted the chapter on his cheating to be longer but those ten little pages explained it perfectly.  He messed up.  He's sorry.  What else can he say?  What else can any of us say?  The rules at the end really spoke to me.  I am taking actions in my life because of this book, and reading it has been a pivotal moment in my life.
0307346609|4.0|This was a gift and my daughter enjoyed it. She is still reading the book.  Unfair to ask for rating on gift.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good app to get. Easy to play. I really enjoy playing cards on the go! This is a wonderful app!
B000NQRE1E|3.0|This was also a gift and have heard no complaints from the receipient.  Have nothing else to say. Thank you.
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|I have read this book in 2013, and i have found many information author wrote is practically can been applied to everyone. Surely it has improved my life. If you need to read one book on this decade, this is one of that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a fun, challenging free app. It's great to play when you want to clear your mind.  A good way to stay sharp.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|The toughest part of making a good action film is the story. When creating an action film, it's very easy for the director to get &#34;action happy&#34; and leave the story behind. What makes &#34;Taken&#34; special is how while the story is nothing complex or mind boggling, the prelude into the action is done in such a way where you truly care about Bryan Mills, (Neeson) so later on when the action picks up it's not mindless, we are in Neeson's corner.<br /><br />&#34;Taken&#34; is about a divorced man named Bryan Mills. He is an ex C.I.A. operative which drew him away from his family. Now retired, he decides to move closer to his only daughter who he at best has a rocky relationship with. His daughter Kim is invited to spend the weekend in Paris with some friends, but needs her father's signature in order to leave the country. Reluctantly, he signs the papers with numerous conditions that she must follow. When Kim and her friend arrive in Paris, Kim's friend reveals to her and a random, handsome looking man they shared a cab with that they have the apartment all to themselves. This mysterious man from the cab volunteers to pick the two girls up for a party he invited them to. However, when he returns, he brings his fellow East Europe gang members who kidnap the two girls and begin to sell them into prostitution. Bryan Mills uses his skills from the C.I.A. to rescue his daughter.<br /><br />While this plot seems simple and overdone in the film industry, what makes this film work is how director Pierre Morel works the character development and the wonderful performance from Liam Neeson.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was great funny also funny lollipop  great ills and good  pictures I love  places that it took places a
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found the book fascinating, well structured and well... riveting.  The author tells an amazing story and despite an arrogance that I perceived, he conveys something deeply profound to him.  This is a lesson for all us - an awareness we all must share.  Yet though his desire is to share his message with everyone - to tell of the wonders beyond, I only wish that people would do that without the price tag associated with the book itself. You would think that going through something so profound and having such an amazing story to share would drive you beyond profit motivations....
B000Q67876|4.0|haven't watched it, ive seen it several times already but for 7.99 couldnt pass it up.  need to stop shopping!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Loved this flick, the characters, the story, the scenery, the whole nine yards.  While I'm a lover of the Sean Connery Bond, Daniel Craig's interpretation is wonderful.  Flawed, talented, emotional.  Love it.

0425263916|5.0|I bought Bared to You and Reflected in You after I couldn't get enough of the Fifty Shades trilogy. I have to say that these books are right up there with the other trilogy. The storyline is a bit more realistic which makes it easier for the reader to really get into the book. I enjoyed it and can't wait til the last one comes out!
1401322786|4.0|A very nice book about time and how we use it selfishly.  A little bit off the wall at times, but typical Mitch Albom.  He is a very gifted writer.  A quick read.  I'm glad I read it.

B00881VLCE|4.0|This is the closest app to solving real jigsaw puzzles that I have found. 215 pieces gives enough challenge to keep you entertained for awhile, especially if you use the rotate pieces option. I enjoy playing this app.
B007P06DJ0|1.0|This is the second Graceland vinyl I've purchased and returned. They both arrived brand-new in the factory plastic packaging and both skipped horribly throughout many of the songs. I've ordered one more replacement--if the third one also skips, I give up. Seems like a manufacturing problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really enjoy it would rate to anyone its easy but enjoyable. Its fun playing to try beat friend's high scores great buy
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This cd has many of Adele's great songs.  Very enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend it to any Adele fan.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|The book is  not one that I would  choose  on my own personally as  time travel is a difficult concept for me. However the book was well written  and interesting in a political sense.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO KUCH FUN AND IT REALLY MAKES YIU THINK!! KEEPS YOUR MIND SHARP! I LOVE TO EEE HOW FAST I CAN GO
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I got this as a gift for my husband. It was new and unopened as described. I am pleased with this purchase.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I held off purchasing this mouse because I was skeptical that a 40 dollar mouse could sway me not to buy a razer or a steel series gaming mouse. I was wrong. This mouse is hassle free. Extremely comfortable. Easy to use and set up. The software is simple even for non gamers to set up and manage. The clicks sound and feel great. The tracking is superb. The adjustable weights are perfect. There is nothing I can say bad about this mouse. If you are looking for a gaming mouse with out al the bugs or the high price? Get this one! You will NOT be sorry! Been using it for over a month now and I game hard with it. Shooters, mmorpg's, stratedy games, you name it. Cant make this mouse lag out or miss a shot and the easy to click dpi helps you zero in on your selected/intended target very easily. Buy with confidence that it will last you a very long time and that you will be able to use it for any application. Oh....one more thing...I have not found a surface that this mouse wont track on. I even stuck it on my head with all the hair and it still didnt miss a beat lol. BUY IT!
0062238868|5.0|Chris's life story.  The truth very well written.  I am pleased to own this book and would recommend it to all.
B002U5HKZ6|1.0|How this book has such high reviews, I have no idea.<br /><br />Some of the cheesiest lines I've ever read.  Anytime his love interest entered the novel, I'd sigh and prepare myself for another paragraph of kindergarten love poem lines about her eyes as green as the ocean, etc.<br /><br />The only reason I got to the end was because I figured there had to be a reason everyone loves this book so much.  Nope.  1000 pg waste of my life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Heard a lot about this book!! Really enjoyed it will get the rest of the series!!!! Hope the others are as good.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This is a lot of fun for diary of whimpy kid it makes me think of summer vacation ya ya
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I really enjoy all the Jack Reacher novels but I particularly liked this one because of the good vs evil  was so obvious that you had to really cheer Jack on because so much was at stake. We know he survived since he's in another book, but how he did it was great!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book because it is very funny and it will make you and your whole family laugh. You should read it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a very fun games it is also very addictive I hope this is a very helpful review I would buy this app if I were you[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a good way to cool down and have fun it's not stress but only fun . And when you download subway surfers it's always free. So when ever you're board  pick the game download it and have fun.
B002MW50KO|1.0|This christmas album is the perfect example of when musicians should retire.  Yes, I'm one of the suckers out there that bought a christmas album by someone that I like.  Sounded like a cat trying to pass a hairball.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Another great epic love stories by Nicholas Sparks!! Just beautiful and great story that like the rest of his other novels will go to my favorites list.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book maintained my interest from beginning to end.  It seems like something that could possibly happen in real life.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Honestly, I was nervous about this album, having bought both We Stitch These Wounds and Set The World On Fire. WSTW was an amazing first album, so I had high hopes for Black Veil Brides' sophomore album, STWOF. Sadly, I was a little disappointed. So naturally, I was very scared that Wretched and Divine would also not meet my standards and hopes. Thankfully, I was VERY wrong.<br />This album was all I hoped for and more. It has some of the most beautiful, meaningful lyrics that I have heard, while having some music that is more upbeat (as upbeat as you can make rock music...) and some that is more melancholy. The violin pieces in select songs is gorgeous, clearly written and performed by a master, and is prevalent in most of the songs – even having its own song. The songs all flow together, creating an album that can be listened to seamlessly. Yet the songs are also perfect while listened to separately. This is something that can only be achieved by excellent musicians.<br />Seeing as how I have never found an album where I have liked every song on the tracklisting until now, I would say this is a nearly perfect record that is unmatchable in its expertise. I would honestly recommend this to anyone that likes any sort of rock music – even if they don't like Black Veil Brides. This is pretty different than their earlier work and just showed their progress as a band and as people.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! it is so addicting! so much more fun than other match type games. you will love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A must play game it's fun and it kids love the colors and they to can play to!<br />All my friends love this game
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not the best book ever but definitely not the worst. Wouldn't read it again. Just watch the movie it'll save u a lot of time.
B000AAF1U4|4.0|THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE may not be among the first rank of Disney's feature-length cartoons, but it's a fun ride that is sure to please to both adults and kids with its mix of sarcastic humor and broad farce--not to mention the incompetently evil Yzma, one of Disney's most memorable villainesses, flawlessly voiced by the legendary Eartha Kitt.<br /><br />The story is flyweight. When Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) fires advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt), she and her servant Kronk (Patrick Walburton) retalilate with poison--but instead of killing him, the potion turns him into a lama. Fortunately, Kuzco finds a friend in peasant Pacha (John Goodman), who against his better judgement helps Kuzco return to the royal city to reclaim his throne. Along the way there are jaguar attacks, bat attacks, scorpion attacks, an offended squirrel, and a terrible restaurant--and Kuzco gradually learns that it is a good thing to be nice to other people. Although the animated series based on this film is actually a bit better in terms of character and plot, the end result is fast paced and charming and delightfully silly.<br /><br />The DVD includes several deleted scenes and an audio commentary, the latter mildly interesting. Recommended for a rainy day!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Last season my husband was missing so I used my Amazon prime account for him to watch on amazon instant app.....he hasn't taken his nose out of his iPad....enough said lol
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is exciting and fun. I would get my friend to play this game. Get this game and you`ll love it.
0529064847|3.0|Its okay in the way that you might like it if your religious. I do not personally like the book because i find it a bit boring.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|Great game ...5 challenges for each level....can be quite challenging.  Get your bridge under budget...or only use certain materials...then go for the safety rating
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|No complaints whatsoever! I am happy with my purchase. No scratches, brand new and perfect. Love it! It came on time. Could not be happier with my buy.
B000MV9026|5.0|I love love love this movie. I suggest this video for any family or any lover of animated films. The extra's that are there are good, I just wish there was more. But that is mainly due to my love of the film. A strong recommendation.
0393327345|5.0|my brother loves it. We even got the movie. This is one of the few i have actually read. Still have it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It needs some tweaking but it's great it also needs to have cave systems and unlimited land and enchantment tables and anvils
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is wonderful. This, I mean in a literal sense, as in it is seriously filled with wonder and awe. It also is quite funny. This has got to be one of the best books of the year.... By far. It is truly a one of a kind story that just flows extremely well with the story line..
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I would give it 10 stars if I could!!  Can't wait to watch the second season!  It's a truly great show.
B004GYNPL2|3.0|i have mSecure on my PC desktop, iPod and Kindle Fire HD. I use this app everyday on my PC - I like the security of having a backup on my tablet devices. At best I can say that it's a very stable app and the sync works perfectly. At worst the Android app is way overpriced for what little value it offers. However, it's GUI is underwhelming and setting up a new type requires each and every field to be set up manually - not even a default 10 field setup or ability to copy from another form. Changing the type can result in lost fields. The copy/paste to feature is a bit wonky - but it's probably the fault of Windows or the FireFox browser.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|A passionate and lively performance. Best of all that recordings of Les Mis that I could find. Would highly recommend this.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Didn't enjoy the book. His brief description of what he saw was dull and boring. Some people that are so highly educated just like to hear themselves talk about some things that no one really cares about.I only got half way through the book and decided I was just waisting my time reading it.
B00932AA5G|2.0|When someone gets hit by a speeding semi, falls off a cliff in a pulverized car and wakes up with a few scratches, you know the movie is bollocks. Uninteresting plot and retarded storyline makes this a time waster. Kingslayer's performance is commendable.
B009ZQI41C|3.0|NOTE: Though I am NOT happy, I will NOT include any SPOILERS!!<br /><br />I am notifying all who care that I am sincerely thinking of giving up this series.<br /><br />There are times that great fiction -- which should of course be prone to the \\"rules\\" of life on this planet -- must present the negative side of life: tragedy included.<br /><br />But there are times that works of fiction deliberately manipulate emotions in what I consider to be an ATTENTION-GETTING END-OF-SEASON RATINGS MANEUVER, and this thoroughly ticks me off.<br /><br />I will not discuss the events that characterized the last few episodes of this season, but I will say this: ENOUGH ALREADY, DOWNTON ABBEY!<br /><br />As the thousands of people who have supplied Amazon ratings have attested, this has been until recently a delightful series that immersed us not only in the aristocratic lifestyle of the privileged, but also explored the matters that concerned those that served them.<br /><br />In addition, DA also clothed itself in turn-of-the-century historical themes that characterized the era, letting us see the impact of major events like the Great War as well as the equally powerful influences as influenza, the proliferation of telephones and the rise of Women's Suffrage.<br /><br />In this manner the series remained topical and true to the era.<br /><br />But toward the end of this season I have begun to feel manipulated through contrived rating-grabbers, and it has really made me question whether I want to continue watching this series.<br /><br />I know that ratings matter, and it's important that a public TV station gain influence on those with deep pockets and pocketbooks, but I'm just about done with the sensationalized events of late.<br /><br />Why not an earthquake that swallows the town?  Why not have John Bates run away to become a barnstorming pilot?  Why not have Lady Grantham swept away by an alluring Sheik of Araby?<br /><br />Right!  These would be absurd attempts to control the emotions of your viewers.  Is this series becoming \\"DA-llas\\"?<br /><br />I'm glad we're on break...I need some time to consider if I'm coming back.emotions of your viewers.  Is this series becoming \\"DA-llas\\"?<br /><br />I'm glad we're on break...I need some time to consider if I'm coming back.

B006GLLREU|2.0|I think they deleted some port of the show .Is not completed .I'm sure !!! So that's is the 2 starts for
B0000AFX64|3.0|Before you consider buying this DVD, you should be aware that Battlestar Galactica - Blood and Chrome (Blu-ray) contains an insert featuring the same cover art from this DVD but in a blu-ray case and \\"The Original Movie That Launched A Phenomenon!\\" written at the top and \\"Own it on Blu-ray High-Def\\" at the bottom.  So, Universal is planning to release \\"BG - The Feature Film\\" on blu-ray sometime in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank You Thank You for this app!!!.  I now no longer have to use a flashlight in my bed when I want to do some early morning reading. And the best thing is I no longer wake up my hubby  because I want to read a little.and I can still stay in the bed with him like he likes.
B007DIQC90|5.0|love the cd, and love the price even more. its great that it comes with the instant download as well so you dont have to wait for the cd to ship to listen to it.

1466401885|5.0|I did not read it !!I did not read it !!I did not read it !!I did not read it !!
B005SEYOXW|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen! The characters are all interesting and I love the mix of Western and Sci-Fi
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is quite the excitement for lots of people I could think and it could be a ln adventure for yourself I highly suggest you download this.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The controls are very respsonsive, smooth game play, a total blast, I can't put it down! If you like mahjong type matching games consider picking this one up too.
B0064W652A|5.0|This was my first foray into the land of comics. Having always been a fan of Batman, this tale taught me so much about who he is and the sacrifices he continually makes.<br /><br />The color, the drawing, the story all blended together to make me feel as if I was reading great literature and viewing incredible art. I was enthralled.
1451696191|3.0|I watched at first the movie before I needed to read it in class. The story has interesting points if you like dramas.
B00004BZ16|5.0|The hits selection is great for a 2cd purchase.  The sound quality is top notch, very hard to beat compared to other cd's that i have purchased.  Excellent product.  Thank you.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|A definitive testament of PJ Harvey as one of the biggest treasures in the music industry and the Arts in general.
0761169253|5.0|I recommend this book to those that are stuck creatively or over thinking their dreams. Let go of thinking you know what to do next. Steal Like an Artist lets me know I can just do what I love and not worry.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Beach House may never get close to the heights they reached with this album, but they will be forgiven. Few artist have ever achieved this level of perfection.
0767846362|5.0|we have watched these over and over. this is a great movie and the price for both movies was so worth-it.  these occassionally come on TV but with the disks we don't have to fuss with commercials and can rewind, pause, and enjoy the movies on our time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book along side books one and two in this series. I thought the book had a good balance between characters and how the author told each individuals story as well as tying them into the main plot. I also think that the book had a great pace to it.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|she has this on her zune and it continues to be on her main playlists. she says it is a great movie and the soundtrack is also great. NOT for everyone. if you like the movie, which I did not, you might like the soundtrack. my daughter says 5 of 5 and she paid for it so in fairness I am rating it on her standard.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book is an easy read and kept my attention.  If you're a soft hearted sap like myself, be ready to create some puddles of tears.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a fun game that helps with brain function. It's sometimes a competitive game too which is very fun to play with friends.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Love this one!<br />Kids and Parents can  enjoy this game.<br />I recomend to any and all fans of Angry Birds and<br />Star Wars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Truly sick individual that leaves you wondering.  Just when i thought it couldnt get worse the tides would change. so very complex characters. What's next?
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game is designed to trick young children into making hundreds of dollars worth of in-app purchases.  Not sure why they decided to charge $20 for each &#34;bucket of bits&#34; instead of $1000 for each.  The ethics involved are the same. Anyone involved in developing or distributing these types of games should ashamed of themselves.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A rollercoaster of emotions!! I recommend it to everyone. Not the type of books I read though. Very emotional though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is another hit for Sparks! Loved the romance, suspense and action. Can't wait to see the movie, though I'm certain it won't be as good as the book was!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|very funny. amazing music. I was pulled into the story very well. I am glad I watched this movie. I plan on buying.
B008476HBM|5.0|Always 5 stars....it really is such an epic story you can't help but love it. I want to reread it right now!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator it has its history so you can go back and see your work its a great calculator and I definitely recommend this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is really cool especially sense it has new obstacles like siplines and new people like Barry bones fox girl it is really cool and fun get now for free
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game just wish it didn't ask for linking with fb and twitter for the quests. My fb is used for work not play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good app with quick access to easily compute simple or more difficult problems. I use it quite frequently, especially shopping :)
0446547573|1.0|Let me just say this is the first book of his I read and I could not finish it even though I was almost at the end... I would give this zero stars if it was possible but I cant so I had to stick with one star and even that made me cringe.<br /><br />First off his editor should be fired because let me tell there are so man issues with his writing that even I can write better then that.  He is repeating him self constantly to the point where i wanted to yell I get it already move on.  He is particularly in love with the word &#34;and&#34; as well as not having a wide vocabulary.<br /><br />The characters were one dimensional and so unbelievable that it was really hard to root for any of them.  For someone who has been a victim of abuse she sure dd not act like it (I think he should have done his research).  The conversation between characters were boring and it never changed through out the book.<br /><br />If you want to read a good author Nalini Singh is one of the best and after reading Archangel storm then trying this book... my brain cells begged me to stop before they threatened to walk away and leave me.  So know I am off to try and read something more stimulating then this garbage... Will never read him again and have no respect for authors who write to make a living not because they love it.. It shows in his work that he is not a real write yet he continues to insult us with this drivel.  Sparks is only in it for the money and not the because he can write or loves it even.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Yes, the case is waterproof if you assemble it correctly.  No, it isn't a good buy even so.  I purchased this for my teenage daughter.  She is pretty hard on her phone, but not overly so.  The door that covers the charging port broke off after about a month (so much for waterproof-ness).  This week, after just under 2 months of use, the corner of the case simply broke off when the phone was dropped about 3 feet.  I understand that no case is truly \\"lifeproof,\\" but this is ridiculous.  There are much better choices out there given the price of this item.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was worth downloading. It's loads of fun and keeps you coming back for more. Definitely worth my tome to play this game. If you like gambling you will like this game.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Used in a new build and performs beautifully. Absolutely problem free and is much faster than the computer it replaced,
B008JGSM6G|5.0|challenging and fun,  great game. I cant tear myself away from playing it day after day. no need to pay for hints,  just keep trying!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Very original with many things that evoke classic horror films like Godzilla, The Birds, etc, The 3D effects are excellent. The Story is great and very wellpresentes, the characters are excellent.
0547884591|2.0|I am so relieved to read the other comments. I thought maybe I was just too dense to get it. I, too, am so bored. And confused. I tried to find some interesting sections, but so far I have not. I am reading it on my Kindle and perhaps that is one of the problems. Some of the diagrams are so tiny, they cannot be understood in Kindle format. I just adore Tim and really loved the 4-Hour Body (I read it twice). He can be very entertaining, but in this book, not so much. I am not entertained or even enlightened by what I have read so far. I at least hoped to take away useful information. I am doing this review early because I don't think I will finish this book.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Biggest problem is Affleck.  He is not a great actor.  It often seems like he is just reading lines.  Some of the other parts should have developed to a greater degree.<br /><br />Overall good movie. Not as good as the hype
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved every page. Definitely wasn't expecting the twist at the end. Nicholas Sparks is a literary genius. Love this book.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Unless you're between the ages of 12 and 18, this is a terrible movie.  If you're an intelligent person between the ages of 12 and 18 and agree with me, that means you have a brain, and are not high.  This movie is gaspingly awful, and ranks among the top 100 worst movies ever.  It's poorly acted, directed, scripted and plotted.  If the first 30 minutes don't kill you with bad acting and teen angst, you should be decorated for bravery.  Avoid this movie at all costs.  I just wasted $4.99.
B00B2QA2F4|4.0|Obviously if you rated this movie less than 4 stars you clearly aren't fans of martial arts movies. Most martial arts movies made after 1982 are garbage but this takes me back to what I grew up on. Comedy, lessons and good fights are always the main components of a great martial arts film to me. This movie has all those things and the brothels never hurt.
B00B2EWNWG|4.0|I found this movie to be an enjoyable homage to the classic wuxia genre - full of improbable(if not impossible) fight sequences and great (over)acting. If you consider yourself a fan of the martial arts by all means check this film out.
1608862801|5.0|Grandson LOVES it... 128 pages... comic book style stories...full page character pics...fan art..it's got it all ! will be looking for future volumes to buy!
B0068FYZH0|5.0|John Nash is one of the greatest minds of our time. A great film showing how people with Schizophrenia can achieve great things. Being from West Virginia, John Nash is a well known name.
0793573742|4.0|yes, great pictures of Vintage Burst Gibson Les Pauls. HQ pics. multiable angles. BIG book. since it's sooo pricey.$35. i treat it with kid gloves. on shelf, in a zipplock. should be $25.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a great story. It is a quick easy read that is also entertaining. The targeted demographic is definitely younger teens, but having said that it has enough of a story to interest an older audience as long as your looking for entertainment not an epic like Lord of the Rings.<br />However...  In EVERY series I've ever read (and that has been many), each individual book has a beginning, middle and end, a focus and a resolution to an immediate conflict while carrying the main conflict through the whole series. Neither book 1 nor book 2 have that formula. I've seen that some reviewers refer to the endings as &#34;cliffhangers&#34;, but I couldn't help but have the overwhelming impression that the publisher got tired of waiting for the completed novel and insisted the writer submit the chapters that were finished so far and published that as &#34;Book 1&#34; then the next batch as &#34;Book 2&#34;. (I have yet to read book 3 though I am planning on reading it soon.) Book 1 almost felt like it was ending in the middle of the chapter instead of the end. The editing also added to the impression of being rushed. Many misspelled and misused words. - Perhaps the bad editing is just in the Kindle edition???<br /><br />I do recommmend this book, but my recommendation is to get all the books together and read them as one [with your internal English teacher turned off or you will go nuts :) ]<br /><br />It would be nice, though, if Amazon pushed for the book to be properly edited.
B007VYQ6DS|3.0|shame i couldn't find dvd, without blue-ray. would have been cheaper. good documentry, but cable has Chimp Eden and Orangotang Island. they are better.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I'll admit. I'm not very good at this game. In fact, I'm mostly terrible. But you know what? I can't stop playing it. It draw you back in with that &#34;one more game&#34; mentality. Every time you solve a puzzle, you have a &#34;Eureka!&#34; moment and you just feel like you've conquered a unique puzzle. Again...I'm not very good, but it sure is fun! It's free folks...try it out. I can't imagine you won't get SOME sort of enjoyment out of this!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I liked the first book better. However, both books  have ' wet my appetite for the movie. Easy read. Nice.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the many twists and turns, jumps, etc. make it so much more interesting. one of the greatest games to play. well worth it!!!
1594135592|5.0|Not a typical king novel but  still amazing! Not what I expected to read at all. I loved it and highly recommend it!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|My 5-yr old and I both play this game. It is pretty simple - just click 2 cubes that match - anywhere on the board. There is a timer going in the corner, but it counts all the way up to like 99:99:99, so it's not going to kick you out - just a way to beat your own score.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|It was easy to watch and looked really great in HD. We watched the other movies in regular format and the difference was clear!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book but it's complex and at times confusing. Best read from beginning to end in the shortest time possible  to stay on top of the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my God this game is so addicting I'm on it like 10 times a day and I'm always playing it in 4th period
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It captures most struggles that teens suffer in these years of high school and makes it relatable so that people can be part of the book itself. Absolutely inspiring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and will never delete it.I just wish that it was easier to get points. So fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best and most addicting games I've played in a long time. The controls are so easy to master a 3 year old can play. This just adds to the fun! It's great entertainment for all!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is pretty good. I came across a couple glitches so far nothing major though. I do not like the fact how in order to get a lot of the better gear and weapons you basically must spend money. So if you are a person that has to have the best then beware you will get nickel and dimes to death.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|First off, Goonies is such a classic that I was excited to buy it for my step brother for Christmas. The delivery was very fast and the quality of the DVD and the case were excellent. Great movie, great experience!
1451696205|5.0|I started reading this book  the day it arrived. Once I started I was hooked. I found this book from a movie review. I have read several books in a teen's voice but this teen's voice blocked out my own age and experience in a way none of the other have done. Charlie is so young and so smart. He observes EVERYTHING. He is puzzled like a new born by what he sees. In the course of his first year at high school he unpacks and analyzes what he sees and what he has seen.  It frightened him into quite a panic. It is this 'thriller' aspect about the stress of examining one's participation, as Charlie might put it, that makes this book a page turner.  'It is just life,' but at an early age and at a pace and depth that kept me breathless. Chbosky hits all the notes and mixes real and imagined scenarios that help one feel and see with Charlie's eyes and moods. One gets laughs and tears and sometimes maybe even the 'infinite' Charlie seeks to recapitulate. To my mind this book is real arm chair participation. As I read elsewhere from another reviewer / reader, ' Good Goosey Miss Lucy this book is good!'
0738212415|5.0|Another great book for beginners, it has lots of helpful hints and tips without being overwhelming. I would recommend this to anyone learning to draw basic forms and shapes.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Okay, so there are already 44 reviews of this film before this review - and all are raving about it. Well, I have to jump on the band wagon too! I watched this French film last night knowing nothing and couldn't stop laughing for the full 122 minutes. A funny and sweet comedy about a quadriplegic? Only the French could pull this off.  And it's based on a true story.<br />You may have already read other reviews her which describe the plot - whether in summary or detail - but, to be honest, it's best to discover what happens on the screen for yourself, so I won't give anything away, except to say that if the first five minutes - which occurs before the title even appears don't get you interested, then I'll be surprised. (And the great soundtrack adds a lot to the \\"feel good\\" feeling of the film.)<br />Be aware that Amazon groups reviews of ALL versions of a release - whether DVD, Bluray, NTSC, with subtitles or without - so be careful to read the description of the release being reviewed. That said, this review is of the Blu-ray version being released on March 5th with English Subtitles.<br />If there is one caveat I will make for those watching the film on a standard definition TV, it is that this is another recent case where the English subtitles are in white print directly on the screen image and not very large. The size is not the issue but there are quite a few scenes where the scenery is white and the subtitles are quite hard to read. I have to say that even on my 27in standard format TV, I missed about 5% of the dialogue (but I could still follow the story). Other recent foreign films I've reviewed recently have subtitles in green or the words are placed below the image, making it easy to read.<br /><br />Both the DVD and BD have the same single \\"Special Feature\\". It is a series of four deleted scenes. These total about six minutes. What is really odd is that the deleted scenes have subtitles which - though white - are at least 50% larger than the ones in the film and have a sharper contrast.<br /><br />No, I'm not deducting any stars - the film is that great that I'm just commenting on the subtitles. This is already my favorite film of 2012 and my bet to with the Oscar for Best Foreign Film! I'm sure those of you who have pre-ordered it through Amazon (remember you want the one with ENGLISH subtitles and NTSC) will find it well worth the wait.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"ilm and have a sharper contrast.<br /><br />No, I'm not deducting any stars - the film is that great that I'm just commenting on the subtitles.

B00197POXG|5.0|So hard to find a show that we can watch together as a family--we love Dr. Quinn.  Love the packaging on this set.
0312330537|5.0|This book is one of the great works of modern fiction.  Absolutely brilliant.  It takes you through the past, present and future of humankind in the steamy, often filthy, overcrowded world of Bombay (Mombay).  It manages to cross almost every aberrant path, brings smiles at the most difficult times and explores the human condition like few novels I've every read.  It is the book you are always looking to find. I strongly urge you to take a very unique and enormously satisfying trip with Gregory David Roberts.<br /><br />In my case, I bought a nearly new version and the quality was well below what I've come to expect from Amazon.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Perhaps it was the movie ads that recently aired over and over that pretty much gave the story away, but we've all heard of these type stories before.  Not very original but it's overall readable.  After reading it (and totally expected the ending), I felt no desire to watch the movie.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Hard to put down....really liked it......I have one more Jack Reacher book to read and then I have read them all
0307949508|5.0|I absolutely loved it.  I enjoyed this second book probably more than the first one.  There were more thrilling suspense and actions.  The main characters as well as some of the minor characters from the first book were further developed and played interesting roles, which added a great deal of excitement to the story.  The author did an amazing job bringing up and connecting the past to the present without being awkward; the flow of the story was indeed like a hot knife through butter.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am very pleased with this cable.  We got a Kindle for Christmas and the cord would not charge the Kindle.  I called Amazon and they immediately shipped this cable for free!  I was very happy that I didn't have to go through the hassle of sending something back and waiting.  Thanks!
B005LAII80|1.0|i received disc and it would not load or play. i rented the movie (not 3d) thought it was good. I will say that the shipper were professional and courteous. i returned the dvd and had no problem gftting a refund
B000OCXI3K|5.0|In these times of intolerance, this story has a lesson for all of us.  I didn't want to put it down and when it ended, I missed these characters.  Well-written, eminently readable.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|The movie got here quick and it works. I would recommend this movie. It's funny and most guys can relate.
B007UQRW62|5.0|The box is done very nicely, and everything is very unique and a great collectors item for fans. I love the posters and the bonus features included!
B00890JFMW|3.0|I had really high expectations for this collection because I love a couple of the songs on it. Although it is good, it's not great. I wish I would have saved my money and just stuck to listening to online soundtrack radio stations.
0425252868|5.0|... Comes another great story of the thousands, from the Second World War. This one, however, is a cut above. Several weeks ago, listening to late night AM radio, just before nodding off to sleep, I heard an interview with an author, and a words about a B-17 pilot and his crew on a mission, a German ME-109  pilot and an amazing story. I tried to make a mental note to look here on Amazon, the next morning, and find the book. Fortunately, I did remember and ordered the book immediately with OneClick.<br />This was a wonderful story to read about flyers in that world war, and much more , as the title indicates, hints at. I for one, am not a religious man, never have been. The humanity and feeling, personal conflict, and eventual resolution, described in this story, confirm in every respect, my ultimate belief that we humans do indeed, have the ability make the world a better place, and make life daily, a precious and marvelous thing.<br />I have been an amateur student of history for most of my 67 years, and have always  been drawn to the impact of modern war, on individuals, and how they reacted, coped, within their own personal spheres, to the great world conflicts taking place around them. This account of two individuals is a masterful telling of these two former adversaries in combat, and the people they influenced, and of those who influenced them, while growing into mature adults under conditions and extreme duress that we, who have never  endured real combat, can not imagine.<br />My own father was also a B-17 crew member, flying missions from North Africa, Egypt, and later India. When I was  young, I remember always wanting to hear his \\"war stories\\" before going to sleep, many nights, as a young boy. As  I read this book, I remembered him also, and only wish I had \\"interviewed\\" him far more thoroughly about his exploits. Mr Makos' and Alexander's book has heightened those feelings, and make me regret even more, not getting more of his personal wartime history. I have an old record, document which lists his combat record, showing five bronze stars, among others, and I have no idea how he earned them, sadly to say;  I'm still researching online.<br />Reading this book, I had tears in my eyes several times - a very emotional, and rewarding read for me. As I told my wife, there are surely thousands more, stories  from World War II out there that will probably never be told -- I'm so very glad that  this one had the ending it did -- and has been told so beautifully and completely. Thank you Mr Makos, and Mr Alexander. And, above all -- thank you, Franz.<br /><br />R.L.

159562015X|2.0|I don't recommend buying this book or paying for the test. It was recommended to me by a boss who really like her results and thought they were very accurate. So I purchased the book and took the test. My results weren't accurate because when you take the test the results it gives you are based on how you feel at that time. In other words, the results are very mood dependent so NOT very reliable. Anyways, the book doesn't contain good information unless your test results are accurate. I wouldn't recommend this.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Playing on Galaxy S3, the graphics are delightful, gameplay is smooth with no lagginess; fun and stress-free.  You can pick this one up and start playing immediately: gameplay is very intuitive.<br /><br />Some suggestions to the developers: could be improved by adding new starting shapes, and by including various sets of cube designs instead of the same 3D cube with the same small component cube designss over and over; the repetitiveness is the only reason I've knocked off one star.<br /><br />Otherwise, a very simple, relaxing, enjoyable game.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it but it wasn't as funny as I had expected. I wouldn't buy it but definitely rent it and see it once!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|you won't be disappointed  love the blu-ray<br />  nice job done ... going to get season 1 and two later but missed some of season3
B000V86OKG|5.0|Second season is great! I just can't get enough dexter. Wish buying the seasons was a little cheaper but its worth buying! I recommend buying used and saving some money rather than paying full price.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read a lot, and I always know John Grisham will provide a great story. He is entertaining, easy to understand and suspenseful.  I wouldn't consider this heavy reading, or requiring deep thought, but didn't want to put it down either.
B008220C56|4.0|A wonderful story although I felt it was not as impactful as the original version that came out during pre-BluRay days. The story is intense (anything by Tolstoy will be) and flashes back and forth between theatrical and real life in its presentations. The acting was great as was the costuming.Overall I would describe it as a very good period piece although not a contender for a Best Movie Award.
B006UG90RM|5.0|with van halen<br />It asking me to come up with 20 more words to describe my buying experience.<br />I only have 2 more to go.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I really loved this movie, I love music and just about everything about it. A personal problem I have with new music (especially pop) is that any one can do it regardless of whether or not the person has talent or not. I felt like this movie illustrated this perfectly. It was funny, it was sad. Overall it was just awesome. I would recommend it to any music lover, especially if you're a rock person.<br /><br />Best part is though it has a BA sound track. And who doesn't love David Grohl?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is an excellent read. I couldn't put it down. My only complaint was that at times it was very \\"Sleeping with the enemy\\". Overall though it is a great book, a page turner. I smiled, I cried, I had sweaty hands!
B008S80OU2|5.0|Ive been a die hard BOC fan since their debut album ,seen them twice in their glory days ,have had every album in every format available at the time they were released (8-track ,cassete ,lp ,cd )this release is the Holy Grail of their work , to me its worth the purchase for On Your Feet Or On Your Knees alone.This is what I purchase these days because this new so called rock is so generic I cant tell one band from another ,anything from the 70s ,80s groups is 10 TIMES better and do you really think in 40 years anyone is going to want any of their collected works ,my guess is a strong no so stick with classics like this and you cant go wrong.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger game series is so touching yet also scary. The comforting nights and the nightmares the cold nights in the arena. All just so well wrapped and together
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|To me, this was not one of Denzel's best movies.  Although he played his roll well.  The movie is still entertaining.  I would recommend this film to a friend.
B004G5Z0B4|1.0|I was not aware of &#34;REGION CODES&#34; when I ordered this and to my horror I could not view!  Seems to me that if the shipping address is the USA there should be an alert or red flag informing the customer that it would not be suitable.  So, now I have to return.  It wasn't until I emailed that I was even told about the region code.  Fine time to let me know.  Even though I'll be refunded the point is this site needs to address this issue.  Wonder how many others had this same problem.  Am disappointed in Amazon and the company who sent it.  One of you should do something about this!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Okay, I get the idea, killing zombies, stuff like that. But 8 bucks????? I've played some pretty bad games in my life but I've never seen a game with the same instability that this one possesses. I can't believe I bought this. The creator of minecraft is a psychopath. This company may have everyone else fooled, but I know the truth. Why else would Mojang be loved by everyone but me? Because I seem to be the only sane person left in this world, while everyone else likes throwing money away. Don't waste your money, I want mine back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game!!!! I play it all the time:) Love it. I truly recommend it! When you have nothing to do, or your just wanting to play a fun game. Choose this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Did I mention I love Dean Holder<3 That boy is perfection! I could not put my kindle down once I started reading. Such a deep an emotional story, I fell in love with the characters and felt all the emotions they felt... please Colleen, I need another book! Give us more of this hopeless boy<3
0316069434|5.0|This novel gripped me from page one and held my interest throughout my reading. It has an interesting plot, is suspenseful, and portrays good characters, such as Detective Harry Bosch, his daughter, and his partner, who one can easily relate to, and bad ones, such as Bosch’s boss and the despicable criminals, who one can easily despise. The book’s title refers to the kind of black box that one tries to find after a plane crash that would reveal what happened. There are two well-developed main plots. Twenty years ago, Bosch found a dead woman in LA and now twenty years later he is determined, although his bosses makes every effort to stop him, to uncover why she was killed and who did it. The second plot involves a complaint filed against Bosch and the investigation by internal affairs. If the allegations in the complaint are verified, Bosch could be fired from the police force. There are also smaller plots, including Bosch’s relationship with his daughter, a woman who likes him, and how Bosch is reacting to the two main plots and the people involved.
1616550414|5.0|When I got this in the mail I went straight for the official timeline. Im very happy with this awesome book.
B008AWBQGM|5.0|All I can really, truly say about this newest Lynyrd Synyrd album, without using an entire list of superlatives, is that it kicks ass!  I purchased 'Vicious Cycle' and thought it was pretty good and that, finally, the latest version of Skynyrd, (with Johnny Van Zant as the front man), was finally developing it's own sound instead of trying to reprise the glory days of Ronny Van Zant.  So I purchased 'God and Guns' and was pretty disappointed in it.  Still a new sound, but the vitality of the songs was missing somehow.  So, with some doubt, I purchased this album, 'Last of A Dyin' Breed.'  S***!  From the first couple of notes of the title song this album rocks!  True southern rock sound and sentiments fans have come to love with all of the guitar this band is known for thrown in for good measure.  This is  the good ol' boys at their (newest!) best.  The song 'Ready To Fly' brought tears to my eyes, and anyone who has had to say goodbye to a beloved parent will closely identify with it.  Other songs are fun, redneck, backwoods, country living, bar room brawling fun to listen to rock 'n roll.  Do NOT hesitate to buy this  album because you won't regret it!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|works great....couldnt ask for more.<br /><br />and FREE!!!!! only regret not getting it sooner. easy to find any and alll hidden files
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  Denzel Washington's acting is terrific!  Also good acting by Don Cheadle,  John Goodman, and Bruce Greenwood, and ESPECIALLY by Kelly Reilly.  The story is really good and also very heartbreaking.  A must see movie!
1452110581|5.0|Good book for cat lovers.  Catches your eye as a coffee table book and kids love it too.  Would recommend.
B009AMAK54|4.0|I really like this movie.  It's very entertaining.  What's not to like...Clint Eastwood, John Goodman, Amy Adams, and Justin Timberlake.  They ALL do a really nice job!  I like the story about a baseball scout with experience (Eastwood) and the difference with the inexperienced baseball scout (Timberlake) and in between that a little romance on the side with Amy Adams and what's really going on between the troubled relations between father and daughter.  I definitely recommend this movie!
B00846F1YW|2.0|This isn't a bad game, it's just not terribly inspiring.  Lots of HO scenes with a few flip-tile games.  PLAYED PERFECTLY ON KINDLE FIRE 2nd gen.  The loading time between scenes was slow.  Why do the people all have to look so creepy?  There was a piece of music- flute and drum- that was my favorite part of the game.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|I had to send it back twice.<br /><br />The DVD never worked in my DVD player(s) or laptop...very disappointing...bad bad product
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! Great way to pass the time. Keeps you entertained and occupied. Would totally recommend this game!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I've had this remote for  a few months now and for some reason the battery dies rather quickly. The remote that came with the PS3 lasts for days when fully charged yet this one when fully charged lasts about a few hours if that. Even the controller if bought off of Monoprice last longer. Another complaint is that it turns off when not used for a while, the controller that came with my PS3 will not turn off unless I shut off the system or manually turn it off. I don't know if this is because I bought my PS3 in 2009 and recent remotes are made to shut off if not used.
B0087OUAFQ|5.0|This is a great dvd concert for One Direction fans of any age. I would recommend this for any fan.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Good quality.  Arrive on time and intact.  Played perfectly.  Won't spoil the Christmas special but boy were we upset!  Looking forward to season 4.
0007488122|5.0|This is a great book for One Direction fans. Its filled with pictures and fun facts about each of the guys.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I wasn't expecting this, this movie was funny!! Reminds me of Despicable Me.  There were a lot of big name stars in this movie.  Good flick, I recommend this one
B007NESBK2|5.0|OMG!! First of all, if you actually went for any of her concerts during this tour, I am TOTALLY ENVIOUS of you. The experience must have been amazing!!<br /><br />I sent a friend to buy me this Blu Ray DVD and immediately I got it I popped it in the PS3 and let me just say for the record, I am never going back to standard TV format ever again!!! HD and Blu Ray it is, from now on!! The quality of the picture, the quality of the sound is just amazing!!! I can only imagine how the sound would be on a surround sound system because from the TV speakers, it was AMAZING!!! ( I had also bought the DVD of Lovers live, and the quality contrast is so obvious. Amazing how 10 years can make such a difference)<br /><br />As expected, the band outperforms themselves here. And the stage set up makes this concert one I would love to see in my lifetime. The lighting, the stage, the way Sade is raised from the stage into the air while performing Cherish the Day, to sort of recreate the 1992/3 video........... I wish I could see her live.<br /><br />Hopefully one day Sade can come and perform in the Motherland. (We can afford it........)
B0006J28KU|5.0|One of the best street shootouts ever.  It is kind of slow, but it is a really good movie if you can stay with it
B00197POXG|1.0|The Audio is out of sync in almost every single episode after the first disc. Completely unwatchable. Ridiculous to spend money on that kind of things. Wheres the quality control!?
1401937519|5.0|Great information on the power of the body/mind/spirit connection and how important it is to stay in a positive and healing mind
B000U0F7RG|5.0|A little pricey, yes, but she loves it.  The packaging is really fun.  A grab-and-go if she wanted to take it to an overnight with friends.  Good, wholesome entertainment.  Worth the money!
B004NYQYNQ|1.0|My love is in central america working for the peace corps and she can´t download it or listen on her cloud player.  Why? Because she is in Central America.  But I buy this from my home in Florida.  How can I get my money back?
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Very excellent, looking forward to more Lincoln Lawyer books!! Michael Connelly is a true master, this series has been very hard to put down!
B0079KGAOY|1.0|You could put these movies into full-color life size halograms and they would still be awful.  Hackneyed, cliche-ridden, mail it in acting, you name it these films have it.  Don't waste your money.  Really.
0811876373|5.0|Love the book and the ideas. Some of the tips and directions are not as helpful / accurate as they should be though. I had to search on line for advice on melting.
B000E0VKXW|5.0|A magical movie that brings back great childhood memories. You can't help but sing along! Julie Andrews & Dick VanDyke...what's not to love??
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow, just wow.<br />I absolutely loved this story. I can't really put my finger on any one thing that made this book touch my heart but the whole package together? Excellent! It starts off sweetly then moves and grows over a very dark subject matter. Not many people would risk writing about this type of background but I thought the book was tastefully written.<br /><br />Colleen, you have done a wonderful, heart wrenching story about 2 people who were obviously just meant to be together. The fact that they lived near each other and didn't know was so sad but life bought them back together.<br />I think because I have kids, you constantly worry about them being \\"taken\\" and I think that is what sat in the back of my mind when reading this story. I am so glad that I read this book and it will be one that stays with me for awhile.<br />I love Holder. He is a strong boy/man who has gone through so much quilt and heartache in his lifetime and never stopped feeling that he has \\"lost\\" something.<br />Sky/Hope is also a strong girl/women who has a past that would mold and shape her to be the \\"one\\" for Holder.<br />Great read - highly recommend this story.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Colleen Hoover and enjoyed her writing style. Looking forward to reading more from this author.
1452110581|5.0|Provided our family with many laughs and, of course, comparisons to our cats.  Great light reading when a laugh is needed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Similar game play and feel to the popular game Temple Run, swipe to jump, roll, and change 'rails.' I prefer the vibrant colors and art style of this game though. I haven't done a comprehensive study of the differences or anything, but the swipe detection and responsiveness in this game feels better to me, as well.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Wowww I must have that unless they made an very Big / Long mistake....? 3 Discs....? Maybe all three Movies .....?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun additions to the original game. Great graphics and updates from original. Really enjoy the cbanges in altitude as the game goes on.
B0015AARJI|1.0|it was charged, charged, placed on, PS3 all fired up but the controller just did not work. i must have gotten the 1 in the 1 in a million that fails.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I had to order a couple extra backup pairs of these just in-case one breaks. I had a pair for over 3 years and no problems... wear and tear they stopped working because the cables became loose after over 3 years... great product!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It is the perfect combination of a mystery show combined with a main character who has a similar personality to &#34;House&#34;.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it in one sitting because I had to know what was happening. The characters are real and I connected with them easily. I wish there was a sequel because I want to know more!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing Emmy Rossum on a daytime Talk Show.  She sang one of the songs on this CD and I just loved it.  Brought back many childhood memories.  I can remember my Mom singing &#34;I'll be With You in Apple Blossom Time&#34;.  It was her wedding song and she loved it.  Every 'oldie' is beautifully sung.  You will not be disappointed.  Emmy Rossum has a lovely voice, easy to listen to, and you can actually understand every word she's singing!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE! So glad to find out it is based on a book trilogy! I will read the books and let you know if it compared. It's usually no in most cases. so I'm looking forward to a great read.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Will Ferrell is a comic genius and the story and support cast in this movie have my family watching it every year.<br />Love the lack of violence ever present even in many kids movies and the sweet redemptive plot line.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really loved the book as a whole but there were little things that made me mad too. First of all, I`ve read books with a very similar plot. Second, the ending was cute and meaning full...just not what i had hoped for. Third, I kind of wishedthat there had been more of Katie and Alex...instead of so much back ground and focus on Kevin. Other than that, it was greatly written. Sparks did it again...More romance. I recommend The Choice over Safe Haven...I have read The Choice 6 times...its great.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|great movie one of the all time classics Peter Pan now my kids have it DVD blu ray and digital copy
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|The other reviewers are correct in their assesments. A pleasant enough foray into what life is like in one's<br />crumbling 80's. Anyone familiar with assisted living facilities know what a fantasy this movie is. This one saving grace for the film, is that  it may well serve to underscore how poor many such \\"homes\\" are. This \\"Beecham House\\" is grand and opulent alright...it's what we all wish for. Sadly few of us will ever experience anything close to this . We should. My loved one works in just these environments. It is not uncommon for a \\"participant\\" to have to be shown where the bathroom is every day-although one such woman could still play the piano beautifully! Couching octegenarians in visual comfort and beauty to me would be a noble thing for any civilized society to think about seriously. So the concept is a good one, and we thank Dustin for his foray into producing and directing.<br /><br />My objection has to do with movie houses in general, and in particular the sound, the voices, the dialogue. You've experienced, those of you over 60,...loss of some eyesight and hearing...and straining to hear what is being said! I am not the only person to complain bitterly about the abominable work by so called sound technicians. It's likely they have \\"golden ears\\"...meaning they can have background noises or music at 86  decibels, and the voices, the speech at 77 decibels...and hear it all just fine. Not the rest of us! a 9 decibel spread means you \\"halve\\" the loudness, halve it again, and halve that again...and there you have the speech, burried under a mound of pillows. Add to that, the deplorable trend in all movies today of mumbling...lips not moving at alll, all speech gargled in the back of the throat. If the sound technician rather knows that people over 60 will be coming to the theater...to overlook the fact that they can't hear well borders on cruelty. I heard, perhaps, one tenth of the dialogues! That left me with one thing only...read body language, and just enjoy the  scenery..and short snippets of music. Building ever more clsoely to the grand quartet finale, alas, we discover our fabulous actors can't sing!...We are treated to the gloriously beautiful quartet during during the titles ONLY at the end of the movie ! !...some professionals singing it.

So we feel cheated a bit, misled, but worst of all...cheated out of hearing what they were all saying!<br /><br />Now of course all the bombastic pre-movie ads, and stunning graphics...is accompanied by THUNDEROUS sound...up there with a NASCAR race track...then the movie begins, and the sound pressure level drops by a good 80%. And you sit there thinking...oh hell! Why do they do that? I'm sure producers have steered movies toward everyone under 25...thinking, oh old people don't matter, and don't care about movies. Yes we do! The movie industry doesn't care enough to make certain actors speak clearly and distinctly. Remember Humphry Bogart? John Wayne? I can think of dozens more...all of whom spoke clearly. But not these sorry excuses for actors today, and their sorry excuses for sound technicians. This oversight makes this movie one soon to be forgotten. Think about this....there were about 6 people in the movie house!  And still the movie industry doesn't understand why? I'm telling them why. Those of us who can afford to go to the movies can't hear what is being said! And a young people are just 'downloading' movies, ...which is NOT going to the movies! This is the hand writing on the wall for the end of movie houses. Six people! Sheesh. That is a wretched failure on the part of everyone involved. Wake up and smell the coffee, theater owners.st enjoy the  scenery..and short snippets of music.

B00013F38K|1.0|I had to return them because I use a carousel player which won't play both sides without removing the disk and flipping it which for a carousel is something of a hassle.  I didn't care to buy two sets.  Sometimes, Amazon Indictates when DVD's are two sided.  Too bad they're not consistent in this practice so I can avoid returns.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|Thought this movie would have a little more story line to it.  I love Matt's other movies and thought this would be something like them.  I was disappointed.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|so far this game is pretty good. gets boring when you have all hidden objects to get a needed item. most mini games are good.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Its Batman for a cheap price whats not to love. I have not checked out the extra's, but so far i am very happy with the product.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I personally loved this movie. I love how well done it is, it does not look overly fake and blotchy, it actually blends seamlessly. As some others have stated.. The dialog could have used a bit more.. Spunk. But it was funny, gory, and all around a good movie. Will definitely be pre-ordering this one!
B0021L8V0W|1.0|Add this film to the unintentionally hilarious category .<br /><br />Why don't they just call it Vinegar ? Or how about Turmeric ?<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is Spider-Woman , OK I get it . Her husband in the film literally is a<br />Spider-Man , how cool is that , huh ?<br /><br />Eye roll when the text message came in , \\"Evidence found that Jolie was at the location where<br />Orlov killed.\\" . BTW , I guess this is a new protocol in the CIA . Why call , when you can just text the damn thing ; the agent might be too busy anyway and can't answer .<br /><br />I can forgive the over the top action but the story itself made no sense<br />whatsoever . Orlov blew Jolie's cover for what reason exactly ? My conclusion is it<br />is not worth the effort to figure out .
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|good quality and was what I want. watch is very accurate and have a good view. I would like be more luminous in dark but still ok.
0765325950|5.0|The ending of the &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; novel is a good piece of writing by Brandon Sanderson You can hardley tell where R. Jordan stopped and B. Sanderson took over. The characters stayed consistant.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've really enjoyed the excellent writing and acting in this historical drama.  It's the best TV series I have seen in a long time, and I recommend it to everyone I know.  Streaming on Amazon instant video has been an extremely convenient way to access the series.
1616550414|5.0|When this book was released in Japan without word on the English version, envy filled my soul. But now its finally here.<br /><br />First quarter or so of the book is about Skyward Sword, which was a good way to start seeing as it is essentially the beginning of the Zelda series timeline wise.<br /><br />This in itself was amazing, artwork of draft designs of characters and outfits as well as explanation of how final look was chosen was great, love learning about the creative process.<br /><br />The next parts were all i could ask for as a Zelda fan, i have two words for you.<br /><br />Timeline Revealed.<br /><br />Not only does it outline the timeline, but it explores each and every game with some fun facts here and there for amusement.<br /><br />The last half of the book is artwork, and as much as i appreciate the games, seeing a brief glimpse into the effort and time required to bring these ideas to life adds a whole new level of respect for the developers.<br /><br />On a note about the book itself its solid and well built, pages won't be ripping any time soon. Hardcover art is fantastic.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Legend of Zelda games and are interested in its history, development and evolution then there is not a doubt in my mind that you will love this.<br /><br />Thank you Nintendo and Dark Horse for bringing this book to life!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was so excited to get my tablet working again so I could buy this book. I am supposed to being reading one of Plato's books right now but cant stop reading this!!

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have researched a lot for a confirmation about the quality of the digital copy. some people confirmed that it is HD in the discussion section. I got the package today and i can confirm that the digital copy is HD from iTunes (Other downloading options are available such as Amazon), in case you are wondering.<br /><br />The quality of the product is amazing. The Package comes with 5 Blu Rays and 2 DVDs and a redeem code for the Digital copy.<br /><br />The show is wonderful and a Must !!

B007DIQC90|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and know that Of Monsters and Men will gain more popularity and radio time. This is a fantastic CD.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|In many ways this is a typical police detective story. But in several important ways it is very different. It details the personal journey of a police detective facing a transitional point in his life.  Harry Bosch has been a cop for 20 years. He has seen many things and inside has grown a great deal of tension and angst. His mother, prostitute, was brutally murdered when he was a teenager - a crime that was never solved.  He became a police officer and ultimately a homicide detective HeI saw many wrong things happen. Pressures built inside him such that he needed to take a leave of absence to solve his issues. He then took upon himself to solve the murder of his mother. This story is as much journey of the man as it is the solution to the case of his mother. It is moving at times and interesting at times. The story is well written and most enjoyable.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|bought this for my daughter/bought it as a download and then made her a disc/was a christmas gift and she really enjoyed it

B00338QENI|5.0|I didn't expect to read this entire book, just the part about Henrietta'a life. But it was so gripping I couldn't put it down. The characters are complex and touching, and the history of medicine and cell culture both amazing and shocking. I also enjoyed the author who became a key character in her own book. A must read!
1451629192|5.0|This is an amazing story written by an even more amazing woman.  She is an inspiration.  She did not allow 18 years of captivity to define her life.
B00B780TAK|5.0|I missed the last half of the final episode of Downton Abbey when it aired on PBS, so bought it for my kindle. I wasn't sure watching it on such a small screen would be as engrossing as on a large screen, but it was. The series itself is, for me, the best thing on television and of course I can hardly bear the thought of having to wait months and months to learn what happens next - and no, I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, other than to say there appears to be no end for new beginnings. The good thing is that every episode is available for very personal viewing on Kindle Fire and the quality is excellent.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Amazing character development and storyline... author fully developes the story to invest the viewer to care about the people portrayed, Maggie Smith is priceless!!! Well done!!

B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Overall it is a really neat game. It is just like the Mario games. Great game and lots of fun. Only problem or complaint is at times it can get a little glitchy but nonetheless you should get the game. It is awesome that it is free.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The game pictures  are sometimes too difficult for an older person to see properly and work with.  Not for me.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is so fun I'm glad I got it at the right time. I like how you can call in the falcon and it takes forever for you to run out because you get more for every like 50 stars! I love how luke evolves from a normal bird, to jedi padawan, to jedi (See the &#34;path of the jedi&#34; episode)! Note: You do not have to do &#34;path of the jedi to get a lightsaber(It just gives you his black outfit and a green lightsaber). I love Han's blaster and Leia's grabber gun thing. One of my favorite parts is using my lightsaber to deflect blasts and hit pigs. Note: Get it right now because Rovio is having a special sale where all their H.D. games cost 99 cents! Limited time only.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book, it was a true classic and I could not put it down. I recommend it for anyone looking for a good story.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This has an awesome setting, awsome powers, and an awesome storyline. I love how it's in space and how there's no gravity but it can whaste some of your stuff. For example, on one level I was stuck and used a space eagle. Well after that, I started launching the rest of my birds so I can raise my eagle score(it won't add to the eagle score for leftover birds) and I hit a warphole leading me to a bonus level. Well, when I was done with it it restarted the level! So I had whasted something that you only get after each chapter. But, I like how Chuck, the yellow bird,(read national geographic angry birds) will go to where you tap. I also like how the warphole egg draws things towards it. The powerup where it inflates the pigs can almost clear the level! There's on powerup where it multiplys the birds by like 7! I also love how the icy bird freezes everything around it. Note: Rovio is having a limited sale where all of their H.D. games cost 99 cents! So hurry, it may end soon!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Exercise easy to follow.  appropriate regardless of age.  Great personal options easy to customize to fit your workout needs worth your time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a really fun game! I like how they have mine carts and ropes and how instead of demon monkeys they have a giant demon gorilla! I like how charecters cost less but I don't like how there's only 4 charecters. The graphics are a lot better than the last one and it's overall awesome.
B00ANW33CM|2.0|I lkove this Mahjong game but this game i did not like at all. I know it was a new and improve version because it was a 3D feel but I didn't like the fact that I had to retotate the screen to find the matching tiles.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|The music deserves 5 stars but was delivered with a corner of the case crushed. CD was ok tho. This is my first complaint about a received condition.
B004EBZX6W|2.0|The idea behind this app is a good idea however the excusion was not well carried out. First of all you have to actually have to connected to a wireless connection to get the analyzer to work. Then this app constantly crqashed so it wasn't really working when I needed the app to work.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great movie. My kids love to watch it over and over. Good movie for kids and adults :).Really cute movie
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Something about this game is addicting, and I like it. Sure it's a take on Temple Run, but that doesn't mean it can't be just as good.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This movie is one of my families top favorite movies now! Super cute :) My kids watch it over and over.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|I decided to read this book after seeing the gripping movie.  It is an incredibly moving, sad story with an ending that allows the reader to choose the future.  I found it difficult to put the book down as I felt totally engrossed.  It brought the reality and brutality of war into perspective.
B00766CLPI|5.0|I already had the original release and wanted to have this re-mastered version with the additional cuts that were previously unreleased. Barbra Streisand is a musical instrument! She navigates classical music with passion and precision. If you have never heard her address classical music, you are missing something elegant and meaningful. This should be in everyone's collection.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Stress is one of our modern lifes disease causes, and Anita placed a lot of stress upon herself.  This is an amazing story about the lessons she was given and how she was able to learn from them.  This book is a must read for people who lead stressful lives and who need to slow down, reflect and be kind to themselves.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 carries thru from Season 1 and adds to the storyline keeping the viewer interested and intrigued. Well done!
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|Even though I was aware that testing was done on live human cells in labs around the world, it wasn't until I read this book that the history was revealed.  The book was engaging and kept me interested from start to finish.  I enjoyed both the human aspects and scientific aspects of the story.  The moral dilemma remains unresolved - if the doctors asked if they could use my cells for the better of mankind I am sure that I would have no hestiation but to give my permission.  The sad thing is that Henrietta wasn't given the choice.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Sad, but once again, very well acted and delivered. The series is a true classic. Not to be missed. Looking forward to Season 4 and all it will bring.
B0050PYNN0|4.0|If you love crude humor, it was really funny! Had an excellent, talented cast with plenty of action. I recommend.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Rodriguez is in the same group as Dylan. One to get to know as far as his music. I believe you will enjoy his style of music. The lyrics are timeless. Add to your collection. Get your's  today......
6305546797|5.0|I'm so happy with this buy. Now I finally own this great and limited set for an extremely great price!!!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|After watching the movie about this artist, I began to search for music of Rodriguez. I like the music of Rodriguez and the message in his songs are timeless. To be unknown to the greater music world back in the sixties, that's wild. His music inspired a generation in South Africa, all these years. And Rodriguez has been(under the radar)performing throughout these years. I would recommend this to those Dylan music lovers and just music lovers overall. One for the collection.
B004N44SOI|5.0|I HAVE LOOKING FOR THIS ONE FOR AWILE. ITS IS WOUGHT IT NOW.<br />ROCK ON. DONT NEVER GIVE UP. AND ROCK HARDER
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This version includes the Bluray disc, the 3D bluray disc, the DVD and a digital copy in international versions (including french). Notice that this is a zone 1 package, so you must have the ability to play it if you are out of America.<br /><br />Concerning the movie itself, if you like Tim Burton, especially the older movies (NBX, Beetlejuice, etc), you have to watch this one. It is viasually very very beautiful and the story is very moving.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great app. I have no problems with the game. It works fine with the kindle fire (first gen.) And with with my galaxy note 10.1 tablet. I am really glad I found a game that my kids love and that they play it for more then a few mins
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The disc came in quicker than estimated, arrived in good condition, and just a great show to watch!! I ended up getting all seasons on DVD and plan to rewatch them again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Gute Grafik gute Reaktion und ich wùrde es unbedingt weiter empfehlen. ps:lob an den Macher :D wenn ich es nicht hãtte wúrde ich es mir wieder downloaden
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I've loved this musical ever since I saw it in London.  The cats are incredible - each one a different personality, and the music lingers on long after the performance.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Recently purchased for my wife, mainly, due to her propensity to drop and spill stuff on cell phones.  This is indeed a &#34;highly protective&#34; cover.  Waterproof as advertised and would probably withstand a direct hit from a killer drone.  Not much on style.  Having a variety of colors is a nice feature but the design makes the device look somewhat &#34;cheesy.&#34;<br />  The biggest problem with this case is trying to use the phone.  The outer cover material is so stiff, you need to be a champion bodybuilder to switch the mute button and need nearly the same amount of strength to adjust the volume.  The home button works fine though.  The fit is so tight surrounding the charger port that you can only use the &#34;apple&#34; connector.  Make no mistake, a generic will not work!  Frustration got the best of us and we discarded the cover.
6305075492|5.0|Filmed in 1920, this is maybe the first gothic horror movie ever made in Germany.  The set designs are spooky and memorable, and the actors playing Dr. Caligari and Cesare are marvelously cast.  A must for any horror fan.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The DVD's arrived fast and in original packaging.  No problems with the order and I am now hooked on the series.
1611761182|3.0|Compared to Giant's Fall, it was a bit tedious.  I loved the background history to the war - it was important to my expectation of what the book would supply, but the presentation was tedious even in the abridged version.  Perhaps the book would have been better, but somehow I doubt it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The DVD's arrived fast and in original packaging.  No problems with the order and I am now hooked on the series.<br />.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What can I say? It's Stephen King...Great plot and interesting look at the Kennedy assassination and all the people involved.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|Love it! High quality and great surround sound. To bad space is but a memory now. Get it while you can.
1400069289|5.0|Loved this book - in fact am still pouring over it. I not only bought the Kindle edition but also a hard copy that I'm passing around to family members. This book really helps us to understand how we form good and bad habits threw out out lives without even realizing it.
B00005JM20|5.0|My kids loved this movie! They couldn't stop laughing the whole time!  It's a fun movie to watch with the whole family!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Good book.  I liked that it was written by someone who first believed that there was no afterlife and now says there is because of his personal experience and that he fully believes it.  I saw him on Katie and that's what made me want to read this book.  I've recommended it to others.  I like how he describes God and the afterlife.
B005EXA8XC|5.0|Kurt at his best and cutest I must say. Nirvana in rare form, loved every minute of it, just wonderful!!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book enabled me to self-publish an e-book without hardly a hitch.  It held my hand all the way through the self-publish process.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Not sure why everyone is calling this a battery drain. I use my Kindle Fire everyday on my commute and have to charge only once a week at the most unless I go crazy playing games for hours on end one day. I like all the stats that it gives that make is easy to track what I can do before having to find a plug.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My child loves playing this app. Good picture quality, and doesn't freeze! I would defiantly recommend for other kids. Also pretty easy to do for my 4 yr old. I just read what it says but he remembers how to do every thing else on his own.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture (a somewhat odd title to a movie, as if we wouldn't know it's for the silver screen) is a pretty shaky opening act for the Star Trek movie franchise, but has since been vastly improved with a director's cut offering more than 20 years later. This director's cut version is much more interesting (visually), with great special effects that add some zest to an otherwise bland storyline. After the television series was cancelled in the late 60's, there remained a cult following to the series, thus creating the 'Trekkies/Trekkers label. A whole decade went by without much Star Trek, but it was the passionate fan base that fueled the comeback. The result is a movie that is vintage/nostalgic Star Trek with the accompanying 60's TV show feel to it. The acting is superb, especially with Leonard Nimoy as Spock. His presentation is smooth and intellectual as usual. William Shatner doesn't disappoint either, nor does the beautiful Persis Khambatta. I won't get into the plot here, because it's been written many times over by other reviewers. However, I have a few comments to make about this movie and the franchise as a whole. First of all, it was very weird yet refreshing and funny to see these actors dressed down for this film; it almost seemed like a slumber party in space!!! The clothes were extremely plain and boring, yet amusing. Shirts not tucked in, an almost 'T-Shirt' look, etc. was very different. Another point I want to make has to do with the soundtrack. The music is a classic, and the main theme permeates this film throughout, especially when showing the Enterprise. It's almost as if the music is saying that the Enterprise is the greatest piece of machinery ever assembled, and the music emphasizes it with pride and emotion each time we see it. And finally, I often wonder if Star Trek would survive if the franchise debuted today, instead of the mid-sixties. Star Trek The Motion Picture has a certain passivity to it, where often nothing much is happening; it just seems to be one big long conversation among the crew of the Enterprise, with the enemy noticeably missing, thus greatly reducing any potential action. Would this resonate enough in today's action-hungry film culture? Even sci-fi films have action in them (Star Wars just to name one), and they do remarkably well. Would Star Trek come across as too boring for today's generation? But what makes this film work is that Trekkies are firmly planted into the franchise, and their knowledge and appreciation for a more intellectual sci-fi experience is imparted to the up and coming generation of potential fans. So therefore the youth of today should at least check out this franchise before judging it. I give this movie 7 out of 10; however, the table is set for the next film, the iconic Wrath of Khan. I still dig this film, despite having shortcomings. The second disc contains lots of cool bonus features.h is happening; it just seems to be one big long conversation among the crew of the Enterprise, with the enemy noticeably missing, thus greatly reducing any potential action. Would this resonate enough in today's action-hungry film culture? Even sci-fi films have action in them (Star Wars just to name one), and they do remarkably well. Would Star Trek come across as too boring for today's generation? But what makes this film work is that Trekkies are firmly planted into the franchise, and their knowledge and appreciation for a more intellectual sci-fi experience is imparted to the up and coming generation of potential fans. So therefore the youth of today should at least check out this franchise before judging it. I give this movie 7 out of 10; however, the table is set for the next film, the iconic Wrath of Khan.

B0090SI3ZW|5.0|AND I liked it better than Django Unchained. I saw this one twice in theaters. I imagine it had low ratings because of the cheesy dialog - but I personally thought RZA's delivery of it was genre savvy and effective. The plot was fluid and action scenes satisfying to the core. I'm really picky about action films I like, and I feel this one fits nicely on my shelf next to the Kill Bill volumes and Boondock Saints. The urban soundtrack was a cherry on top.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Considered by both (American) movie goers and critics as one of the best movies of 2012, it is something of a propaganda piece but then a pretty good/honest one, reminding viewers American grievances against the Islamic regime in Iran over the last generation -- the taking of diplomats as hostages was something simply unheard of in the modern era until Iranian hostage crisis of October 1979- January 1981.<br /><br />Though remembered largely in the United States as a time of, above all, humiliation, this film focuses on one of the few \\"bright spots\\" in this terrible episode ... the successful extraction of 7 American diplomats who weren't captured by the Iranian government organized mob that stormed the U.S. embassy but took refuge in the Canadian Ambassador's residence.<br /><br />How to get the seven out?  Well it wasn't easy.  A cover story had to be concocted.  The story that the CIA settled on was having an agent Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) come to Tehran posing as Canadian film-maker looking to scout locations for a fake science-fiction movie called \\"Argo.\\"  The seven Americans would then be pulled out of Tehran under the guise of belonging to his \\"film crew.\\"  Was it a \\"lousy plan?\\"  Yes, but it was the \\"best lousy plan\\" that the CIA had and it played on the Iranian regime's desire to portray itself as \\"normal,\\" that is, eager to accept foreigners, if _not_ Americans, coming to their country \\"do business\\" even perhaps \\"making films.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, the film's based a true story and it offers a bright spot in an episode in American history that most of us Americans would probably want to forget.

B00AJLHUYO|1.0|Definitely a hard-R film and definitely not for \\"the little ones\\" complete with realistic though _thankfully fake_ grainy Super 8 \\"snuff films\\" depicting a series of grizzly murders, the movies is about a \\"true crime writer\\" (played by Ethan Hawke) who moves his family into a home that had been the site of a horrific mass murder of an entire family.  There, in the empty house he finds a box of Super 8 \\"snuff films\\" chronicling not only the murder of the home's previous residents but also several other grizzly mass murders.  The film proved so graphic that 2/3 into the film, knowing pretty much where this movie was heading, I got-up and left.

1781164266|5.0|I’ve mentioned this before, but I have to reiterate:  I love seeing concept art behind my favorite games and movies.  There’s something almost magical about how designers can translate concepts into reality for the screen.  So when I heard about THE ART OF DEAD SPACE and how it would cover all three games, I knew I had to see it. The fine folks at Titan planned the release of this book to coincide with the release of the third game in the series, and it is a perfect compliment to the epic horror franchise.<br /><br />If you’re a gamer, this book is a Must Own item.  As a huge fan of the series, I am glad to own this beautiful coffee-table book.  But aside from the lavish graphics, readers will get some in-depth and behind-the-scenes information only available here.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of THE ART OF DEAD SPACE is that it covers the whole series and everything within the universe.  This includes characters, creatures, landscapes and locations, vehicles, scenery, and even outer space.  The scope of this book is stunning and the information provided is very comprehensive.<br /><br />From carnage-filled hallways to desolate planetscapes, this book will transport you into the Dead Space universe and immerse you in its depth.  Whether you’re a fan of good art or a diehard gamer, you will love the illustrations and information in this compendium.  Check out THE ART OF DEAD SPACE now.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I own every Batman movie that has come out as far back as the first one with Michael Keaton (whom did a surprisingly good job at the role) as The Batman. This one, Dark Night Rises is perhaps the best one. In all the movies there is always New gadgets, New vehicles, and there is always \\"The Hotties\\". I think this one was superior to the others, in that the Batman is vulnerable in ways as never before...Oh sure, The Batman is always taking a licking, but this time he couldn't just go to his bat belt, or Robin, or BatGirl his bat friends, before, he always came out on top. But in this latest one, Batman (and Christian Bale is my favorite at the role) has practically given up after the death of his beloved in the last movie...for the first time, Batman can't just grab a gadget or dramatically fly away, this time he is nearly beaten by himself...great stuff! I loved it! I loved the characters as well. Jane Hathaway fills in the best role of HOT-TEE! As well as being the mysterious Cat Burgler/ Woman Ever!  You have to watch it at least three times to catch all the good stuff going on off centre. Bale is always good in anything he plays in, and Morgan Freeman...?  How old IS that guy!? But he, too,  always plays a good character. He's like everybody's ideal president, grandpa or something, even made a great God in Bruce Almighty!  And the dude in the mask...disturbing...But the action, the neat gadgets and vehicles...fantastic. I just wish I'd have watched it in 3D...

B00000J7M0|5.0|I'll echo many of the comments here with regards to the tightness of this band and the excellence of this album's set list. However, I have seen a few reviews that call this a \\"live greatest hits album\\". I want to stress that Accept is not a \\"hit\\" band. They never were! \\"Balls To The Wall\\" was pretty much their zenith in terms of actual \\"hits\\". The videos for \\"Balls\\" and \\"Midnight Mover\\" (off Metal Heart) were the only vids they actually made available to MTV and saw a fair amount of airplay, but I would certainly not call them \\"hits\\". You may think the point I'm trying to make somewhat diminishes their legacy as metal titans. That is actually far from the truth. This SOLIDIFIES the fact that they were (and still are today) titans!! So many of these songs seem like greatest hits because their albums were the epitome of \\"ALL KILLER...NO FILLER!!\\". While they have had somewhat of an influence here in the States, go anywhere else in the world (especially Europe) and they are still revered as metal gods, maybe moreso than Judas Priest in some areas.<br /><br />With regards to the album itself, I love it because it's the FULL show that was released previously in a severely shortened format for the 1986 EP \\"Kaizoku Ban\\". Like most have said here, I too believe that Wolf Hoffmann is among the most underrated and underappreciated guitar players in rock/metal history. I'll go further to say that the Hoffmann/Fischer twin axe attack is as powerful as Murray/Smith ever were...and even MORE tight than Downing/Tipton were. I know many metal purists would want to slay me for that comparison, but it's true (IMO anyhow). Having seen this actual tour live (my first real concert at 16), I still regard it as a revelation and this album is a testament to the greatness of one of the best metal bands ever to grace the earth with its footprint.

B003G94BZC|2.0|Why do so many people seem to call this the &#34;best DW season yet&#34;?  Compared to the previous 4 series, this one is very, very poor.  The scripts are boring and childish; Gillan and Smith make a very poor team - they mumble and have very intolerable accents in addition to displaying very limited and amateurish acting skills; the sound, video, and special effects are dull and repetitive; and the overall seasonal plotline lacks any coherence or follow-through.<br />I give this season 2 stars, only for making a feeble effort to keep the series alive.  Hopefully, things will get better or die gracefully.

B00AH8FTT2|5.0|After the previous book finished so abruptly (actually in the middle of the story), I was extremely curious to see how the Chronicles would resolve in the third one.  So, I preordered it, and started reading it as soon as it downloaded.  Finished it in less than a day.<br /><br />It's very much a book in two parts.  The first half is the family chronicle part; a court case concerning a contested will, a hostile raid on Barrington Shipping, a fiercely fought electoral campaign, ...<br /><br />And then in the second half, the author introduces a plot so melodramatic that it's almost comical.<br /><br />The third starts at exactly the point where the second finishes, so you need to have read the first two before starting this one.  A recapitulation summary would have been useful at the beginning.<br /><br />What made me think it was a trilogy?  Perhaps I'd confused it with Ken Follett's 'Century Trilogy'? 'Best Kept Secret' (like the previous two) ends with yet another unresolved cliffhanger.<br /><br />So when is the next one being released?  How many exactly are going to be in the series? I'm really enjoying the series so far...

B00B6DTWM2|4.0|What do you get if you take \\"Amityville Horror,\\" \\"The Ring,\\" and \\"The Shining,\\" mix them together, and make one film?  \\"Sinister,\\" of course.<br /><br />Now usually, I'm not a fan of the whole found-footage genre.  And I also find films where the main protagonist is an author to be somewhat \\"lazy\\" -- it's not too hard for a writer to add this type of character since he's lived it himself.  However, the found-footage \\"stuff\\" is necessary to drive the plot -- and perhaps even a possible theme, discussed below -- and I actually liked the way that Ethan Hawke played the writer character here.  So I think that both of these elements worked.<br /><br />It seems that the director and screenwriter were trying to introduce the following theme:  what we watch truly does affect who we are, and how we think.  While the protagonist is appalled by what he watches, he is also intrigued and drawn in at the same time.  And this in turn drives his behaviour and the outcome of his and his family's life.  If this is true, Hollywood should rethink their current argument that movies and video games have no effect on violence in America.  (Just a little public service announcement for ya'.  Just an added extra since, well, I care.)<br /><br />Perhaps not really a four, but maybe more of a 3.5.  But I'll round up today because, while I surely liked \\"The Ring\\" better, this was still pretty good for the genre.

You can select favorites, mix files for a personal touch and set the length of time the audio will play. It's fabulous! I choose my mix file, put my (first gen) Kindle Fire in sleep mode and drift off to sleep hearing the pleasingly gentle lapping of the waves on the shore, owls hooting and a campfire crackling. So much more restful than hearing the television in the next room. If you need a white noise generator or would like one to use in meditation, this app is more than worth checking out.

B00364K6YW|4.0|Pride and Prejudice (1940, 1985, 1995)<br /><br />Cinema and television have produced three versions of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that I know of. The first is the 1940 production (dir. Robert Z. Leonard), which Leonard Maltin's Guide absurdly gives four stars (****)! with Greer Garson playing Elizabeth Bennet, and Lawrence Olivier Mr. Darcy. Now this might not have been a bad choice, for Greer Garson is an excellent actress, but she seems a little (about ten years) too old for the youngish (20 years) Austen heroine. And as for Sir Lawrence, who could have objected to him--except that here he is just too smaltzy to be the stiff Darcy, too emotional (says \\"I love you\\") something that the actual Darcy in the novel never does. He has the looks and talent, but this whole production is off target. (Despite the literate group of screenwriters, which included Aldous Huxley. What could they have been thinking?) Too many absurdities in this one--including a barcarole a-la Venice in an English garden! And how about Lady Catherine de Bourgh planning Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth?<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice (1985)<br /><br />A much better--though much more modest--production was that of BBC in 1985 (with more advancement in decades, one would expect a more respect in filming literary masterpieces). This one features Elizabeth Garvie--a 20 year-old actress--playing a twenty-year-old, who has the looks, the energy, and the winsomeness of Elizabeth, although one has to admit that both acting and directing in this one occasionally show limitations of budget and talent. But at least Fay Weldon's script follows the original fairly literally, and the four hour production  covers the major events of the story, and manages to give an entertaining presentation to the faithful. David Rintoul, too, is a much better choice than Olivier (though of course, on the whole, a much more limited and less visible actor than the legendary Olivier). But in this one, he gives a perfect Darcy: tall, stately, stiff, uncomfortable, but melting with politeness once he has been chastised by Elizabeth's rejection of his suit. Their dramatic clash mid-way through the story is given very well, and the photographing of the moment when he delivers his letter of apology (and defiance) to Elizabeth is very well filmed--visually. Their meeting at Pemberley--the next most dramatic scene--is also done well, and both Garvie and Rintoul rise to the occasion there, as romantic lovers. And the climactic scene, when she accepts him, is done in quite understated way (as is in the book), but it works well, for Garvie has a soft voice that fits her confession and slight provocation of Darcy. He accepts her, and the whole thing is quite convincing.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice, directed by Simon Langton; Andrew Davies, Screenwriter; Carl Davies, composer<br /><br />As for the  A&E/BBC production of 1996 (see above), it has much to recommend it, for it is a much longer and much more lavish production, with a more numerous cast, a spectacular music score by Carl Davies (based on Mozart's music), and choreographed dances of the numerous parties given during the lengthy story. It has a better Wickham, though not a better Mr. Collins. What I find a little objectionable in this production is the role of Darcy assigned to Colin Firth. There are pluses and minuses here. Firth is a much more dashing fellow than Rintoul, giving Darcy energy that the latter lacks. He is a passionate, involved, an almost reckless lover, scorched by Elizabeth's rejection. This production offers his point of view--through flashbacks and parallel editing giving his actions as they occur, something the novel of course does not do, for Austen's original story is told exclusively from Elizabeth's point of view, and Darcy remains somewhat of an enigma to the reader until the end of the story when we, and Elizabeth, really know who he is--a good, generous man, a fine master and brother. I don't know that the change of point of view matters to the viewer who does not know Austen's work, but it does change the characterization of both leads, and also creates an additional problem: it shows a Darcy far more interesting as a person and leading man than the object of his attentions--meaning the Elizabeth of this film. For the choice of Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth seems somewhat unfortunate. She is just adequate--and perhaps OK for a lesser production. She has the intelligence necessary for the character she plays and (though a born American) she has the right British accent. She is lively, but slightly shrewish, and a bit shrill at times. She lacks the \\"weight\\" and poise that this role demands. She smiles nicely, has nice teeth, and looks the part occasionally; but also scowls a bit too much,  throws tantrums when angry; something beneath the calm \\"archness\\" (word used by Austen) of the original character's mannerisms. Austen's Elizabeth Bennett is poised and her skills at repartee are quite well honed. In this sense, the character rendered by Greer Garson is of course superior.  The original Elizabeth delivers her darts with aplomb and a polish that Darcy admires, to the point that he falls in love with her wit rather than her looks--though he apparently is also captivated by her \\"pair of fine eyes.\\" Jennifer Ehle does not possess the required fine looks--and her moments with Darcy are not well accentuated in a film that seeks to establish the romantic, rather than the satiric aspects of the story. It is odd that the magnificent Colin Firth (for he is that in this film) seems an overmatch for the persona created by Ms. Ehle, and maybe this is the drawback of this whole production. Quite enjoyable on the whole--but failing to connect most of the time. Only exception: the Pemberley scene, where Darcy and Elizabeth seem to have reached a well-tuned moment together. I wish I could give this a better review, because I have already seen it several times; Jane Austen has a way of inspiring--and a romance is a romance, especially one that has all the other production values mentioned.hange of point of view matters to the viewer who does not know Austen's work, but it does change the characterization of both leads, and also creates an additional problem: it shows a Darcy far more interesting as a person and leading man than the object of his attentions--meaning the Elizabeth of this film. For the choice of Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth seems somewhat unfortunate. She is just adequate--and perhaps OK for a lesser production. She has the intelligence necessary for the character she plays and (though a born American) she has the right British accent. She is lively, but slightly shrewish, and a bit shrill at times. She lacks the \\"weight\\" and poise that this role demands. She smiles nicely, has nice teeth, and looks the part occasionally; but also scowls a bit too much,  throws tantrums when angry; something beneath the calm \\"archness\\" (word used by Austen) of the original character's mannerisms. Austen's Elizabeth Bennett is poised and her skills at repartee are quite well honed. In this sense, the character rendered by Greer Garson is of course superior.  The original Elizabeth delivers her darts with aplomb and a polish that Darcy admires, to the point that he falls in love with her wit rather than her looks--though he apparently is also captivated by her \\"pair of fine eyes.\\" Jennifer Ehle does not possess the required fine looks--and her moments with Darcy are not well accentuated in a film that seeks to establish the romantic, rather than the satiric aspects of the story. It is odd that the magnificent Colin Firth (for he is that in this film) seems an overmatch for the persona created by Ms. Ehle, and maybe this is the drawback of this whole production. Quite enjoyable on the whole--but failing to connect most of the time. Only exception: the Pemberley scene, where Darcy and Elizabeth seem to have reached a well-tuned moment together.

B000UO7IM4|5.0|I have a lot of Thelonious Monk - but these 5 CD's from very productive time with Columbia gives you an entry at an affordable price to one of Jazz most outstanding and pecuilar piano players.  He can make Johan Sebastian Bach's \\"well tempered clavier\\" sound totally out of tune and play each tune so uniquely with one delayed hand which so far none have managed to copy nor master as Monk did.<br />Monk \\"Straight No chaser\\" sounds like something James Bond would have coined, but Monk composed this melody back in the 40th, and here Charlie Rouse on Tenor adds flavor to the proceedings.  And a great way to get introduced this his quartet.<br />The 2nd CD \\"Underground\\" with the same quartet again shows off Monk's totally offbeat personality.<br />Criss Cross - his 2nd Album for Columbia Records picks up the pace and is full of very enjoyable music.<br />Monk's Dream - the 4th CD has always been one of my favorite Monk recordings and his first recording in many years (for Columbia)- this is Jazz at the utmosts and includes like most of the CD's several \\"takes\\" on the recorded tunes as a bonus.<br />The last CD \\"SOLO\\" as it indicates is Monk totally on his own. It sounds like he got a too well tuned piano, which he desperately tries to play out of tune.  You get 20 numbers - 6 freebies from the original disk, and just listen to \\"ASK ME HOW\\" and the wonderful rendition of \\"These Foolish Things\\" and you will become a fan of Thelonious Monk - like I am.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|I listened to the rave and craze of this little alcohol burner stove and cook set for years now.  I tried building my own and never quite got it right.  I don't know why I didn't just buy this one in the beginning, its not that expensive.  This specific kit comes with a pot, pan and a universal pot handle.  The stove is very reliable and well made.  It works flawlessly!  This kit is very lightweight and easily packs away in your backpack (or wherever you want to put it).  The simmer ring actually works.  I can honestly see this kit becoming my favorite (of many).  Highly recommended.  I hesitated for several years, don't make the same mistake.......buy one!
B007SGM084|3.0|If you want to read it just for the sex it is all good but I got tired of all of the sex it over tookk the story and got pretty boaring wanted more story
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This is a beautifully acted movie with no Hollywood Glitz to ruin it...The Actor portraying Blessed John Paul II is outstanding.!!<br />This movie captures his life before his religious life, and his love of country, his friends and theatre all come together to tell the story of the man who would eventually become Pope.  There are many moving scenes in this movie, specially the Holy Fathers love of Prayer and devotion~~Highly Recommend this movie and a wonderful Family Night Pic as well....
B000E6UK32|5.0|This CD and DVD combo is awesome. The music is great and Debbie Harry is so easy on the eyes. You can listen to her beautiful voice alone or watch all the vintage videos and radio promotional videos all day and night. I wish more bands would offer this type of format for fans to buy. It is the first Blondie CD I grab from my collection.<br />The nice thing about Blondie is I am a younger fan that does not even remember anything about the 70s. I discovered Blondie just searching for something good in the trash heap of garbage that is called modern music. Blondie is around because there is no one that is genuine and fresh.<br />If you are a hardcore fan of Blondie this CD/DVD is for you. If you are like me living in a black hole of crap modern music, this CD/DVD is the Bomb.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Okay so I got to the 6th level then I updated it and I lost everything and at first I didn't know what the problem was. Then I recently updated it and I was in the 2nd level and all my stars were gone! Really thats the main issue with me. Its a fun app and I would recomend it just don't update unless you want to loose all your stars and start over!
1452110581|5.0|My boyfriends sister thought this was the best book ever! A must read for any cat lover in your life
145210655X|5.0|What can I say?<br />It is a perfect match, a friend just had a kid and this was perfect, all my other friends had girls, so this was the only chance (a book with leia is on the works as well)
B0074MZSWW|5.0|What a great sound...these guys are awesome!  After reading the review in RS magazine I had to check them out...well worth the money...
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Soundcloud in my opinion is one of the greatest things to be created in awhile. What this program does is allow all different types of artist to stream, share, & download various types of music from all over the country. Its a great way for artist who have financial issues to make music and not have to pay much money as you would for a professional recording studio. You can record music on your phone, IPod, and any other device that will allow you to have the app installed and has a mic on it. I recommend this to all artist who plan on saving money and want another music outlet to get their name out.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I like that it gives you a lot of synonyms. Comes in handy when doing crossword puzzles. Easy to use.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read FLYNNS Gone Girl and really liked the story, twist and turns.  I think dark places is just as exciting and fun to read.<br />Maizymae67
B004WR125O|5.0|Ordered this adapter because I don't have a cable near my HT system. This was an easy solution. Just plug it in the USB port and you got wireless connectivity. Works great!
B0095P31L6|4.0|This is a very interesting cartoon.  My 3 year old loves it, but I don't know that I would necessarily recommend it as a kids movie.  I found the movie very humorous and the story is a good one.  I also really like the characters and Johnny Depp is especially wonderful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey guys, Tommy here and Amazon, this is for you. A few years ago, my first cousin, Alex, showed me and my sister this game called &quot;Minecraft.&quot; And to tell you the truth, it was LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. I've played Minecraft for a month now, and it is highly recommended if you ask me. BEST GAME EVER! (^_^)b
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Amazon mobile is the best way for me to continue using my favorite online website while on the go. I can check the status of my orders through the app and also shop the same way I would while on the website at home. There really is no major difference and I would highly recommend this to everyone who likes to use the website and needs another way to surf it quick & fast when not at home.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I truly appreciated the fact that Chris focused on more of the internal conflicts that he was attempting to rational his way through rather than  writing just another gory war story. I believe that it is important that we the fortunate citizens at home are given opportunities to understand the feelings of personal conflicts of loss, fear of an uncertain future for themselves and their loved ones, and the insight that all of our warriors endure on the battlefield and later as the attempt to reconcile their actions. Thank God that these warriors are willing to endure their struggles and somewhat become damaged as a result of performing necessary actions to provide our great country with the security that is so greatly needed in these uncertain times.<br /><br />David G. Page, Knoxville, Tennessee
B0034DGPEU|5.0|LOVED this book and every character and didn't want the story to end.  This one will be difficult to top!!!
B00006AW2G|5.0|Don't know why it took me so long to get this CD.  It's just a great recording with songs that rock, acoustic country swings, and down home blues.  A lot of good Stones records but this one just goes down easy.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Descriptions are nice I like the characters but the writing isn't spectacular. I feel like it's missing a richness, or depth.
1451696191|4.0|I read this book for book club somehow thinking it was a comedy. I was far from correct. This is a short but well written novel that tackles issues that only a wallflower will deal with.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i love Kindle. this was one of the greatest things to come along for reading books. so simple to use.
B008M721MS|2.0|The app is very very unstable and crashes for various reasons.<br />crashes when the orientation is changed.<br />screen changes are not user friendly.
0545265355|5.0|I don't go to movies because I'd rather sit down with a good book. Another set of books by Suzanne Collins that I could not put down.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Kept me guessing and wanting to go right to the next book!  Cannot wait to see what happens next....glad I bought the whole series.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very relaxing and enjoyable. Highly recommended. Enjoy anytime anywhere. Fast download and easy-to-use. Price is right. You will enjoy experimenting with different mixes.
B000O78KW4|5.0|good movie to add to the die hard series, lots of action, and funny too.will buy more when needed. thanks
B0098VXDDS|3.0|Not quite as exciting as the first two seasons, but not bad. The characters are not quite as like-able to me, and I'm not sure if it's the over-dramatic acting or the direction. I might keep watching next season, but not until it came out for free.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! Produced with a budget of just $50million (which is not a lot in the film world), the makers of Moon have delivered an excellent sic-fi piece that rivals the much bigger budget productions.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Graphics are excellent and the game is fast paced u don't have too wait all day to play again it's very addicting I really like this game.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I love this movie. The acting is a bit wooden in some places, but the sets, musical numbers, and costumes more than make up for it. If you're looking for a really good story, look elsewhere. If you want eye candy, this is your movie.
B00A2BTCXI|4.0|Buy it and enjoy the music. The video is not very exciting since it is all cartoons. But at least it's something to watch.
034580404X|5.0|great price, great read, must buy, all three together is a steal of a price, and of course story is amazing
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Love this calendar. Nice colors and love the icon and create your own mark feature. I used the colored text option to sort out different family member activities. You can choose your preferred calendar layout (I prefer seeing the whole month). At one quick glance I can see my whole month and activities for the specific day.  Create single events or repeated activities. Very User friendly.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm so glad that I preordered this before it came out! Roger Deakins delivers such a beautiful movie that truly compliments the amazing acting and fantastic action sequences!
B007IUFBCM|5.0|I love Drake. And the price during black friday was just unbelievably low, couldn't pass up the chance to get it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Love this series. Katherine is such an awesome character. The special features are nice but could be a little meatier, overall awesome though.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a fun and very addicting game. I highly recommend it. Fun for kids as well as adults. Try it and you will like it.
030758836X|3.0|I plodded through this book flip flopping on hating it/loving it.  I thought it was moving way too slow in the beginning and then when if finally picked up 3/4's of the way through it, total disappointment in the ending!! I even went back to see if pages were missing.  It was sort of the Soprano's finale of books!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Enjoyed the game very much. Some of the puzzle were easy but I enjoyed the challenge. Can not wait for the sequel.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|This is a fun movie.  It's not deep, or really thought provoking, but is a good time if you're in the mood for some futuristic action.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website
0767819594|5.0|This is a good movie. When I ordered I didn't even notice it was a VHS. I thought I was ordering a DVD lol. But this movie launched a few good careers so if you like these types of movies it's a must for your collection.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|Awesome, and funny. We laughed to the floor. A bit of problems getting it started but got fixed in a while
B004EBUXI0|5.0|wow !! this cpu is smoking fast,plays games awesome cant go wrong for the price. No issues whatsoever would recommend without hesitation.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I tried it out and it works well. I like it and would suggest it to a friend. What more can I say!?!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|What really struck me was how good looking this movie is! From the cinematography to the production design, this picture is on point! It's one of my favorites to come out in the past year

B002JVWR9U|5.0|This series starts out a bit slow but after that it picks up and gets more interesting. Caroline's evolution is interesting to watch.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This is still a classic movie.  I watched again with my high schooler.  It really made her think about the class divisions in school.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I end every night playing this game to ease my mindflow,lol. Flow is an intuitive mind warp logic puzzel game that makes sense. Cool, Fun and very addicitive!
0553386794|5.0|I saw Season One of Game of Thrones on HBO.  I loved it.  I had to buy the book.  The books are great and Martin will have you captivated.  I have now finished all five books and cannot wait for the release of the sixth (whenever he finishes writing it!).  These books are great and I would highly recommend them!
B004L3AR0K|4.0|I really liked this film.  It was both  funny & sad.  I enjoyed it & I would recommend it. The story & performances are worth a look see.

1401322786|4.0|Having read all of Albom;s books,therei seems to have been a serious philosophical premise -requiring much meditation. It will take me some time to find a reason for having read it.
B000F9RB8K|5.0|This is a heavy movie. However, the acting and story plot are so good that I have watched it many times. That quality is the reason I purchased the Blu-ray version.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie has some holes but it was worth the time to watch.  The most exciting portion of the film was in the first 10 Minutes.  Denzel is such a great actor he could convince you that pulling a tooth is fun.  He plays another broken and dysfunctional character but he plays it in a way we can admire, that we understand.  You will end up rooting for him even through his flaws.  The movie will leave feeling like nothing was really accomplished but at least you were there to witness it.  You should watch the movie but just don't expect too much.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Tough for a third grader to read, but easy enough for it to be understood if read to.  Woesome tale of three orphans which ends in a suspense-filled thriller.  Buying the next book in the series tonight to read to my family.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent book!  A must read. I can not wait to see the movie!  Nicolas Sparks is such an amazing writer!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is Definitely the best book I have read by far! I rate this book five stars because it is AMAZING.
B00881VLCE|2.0|It looked fun, but its complicated.<br />I still don't know how to use this app and the directions, or lack thereof, make it easy for me to say, don't waste your time here.

B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Best animated batman movie ever!<br />Emerson and Weller are at the top of their game in this movie and its fantastic
B00A8ZZ570|2.0|I've tried listening to this thing on at least five different occasions, and the last few times, just putting it on has literally gotten me steamed. I have only this to say about it: while it seems like a great album, the saxophone is way too god damn loud. Period. Hell, I'll be honest. I've never owned anything by Chris Potter before. I bought this because it was recommended and seemed like a good listen, and probably at least 50% because it has Eric Harland on it. I mean come on. You can't go wrong with Harland. But this is unlistenable as they've mixed it. If I have it at a reasonable volume, pretty much all I can hear is Chris Potter. If I turn it up so I can hear everything, then every time the sax comes in, I want to stab myself in the ears. To me, it seems just plain unprofessional. It's a huge disappointment, because I know I would really enjoy this album. They dropped the ball here.
0132350882|5.0|A really nice book that must be read and absorbed by anyone who works on a team and/or is looking to improve him/herself. When I read, I identified a lot of concepts/practices which relevance I already knew but I realized I was not really being pragmatic in adopting it.<br />The book is very clear on the concepts and explanations, has a lot of examples and is written by Robert Martin !<br />A must have (or read) by any serious software engineer.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've been looking for an affordable pair of lightweight headphones for running.  My daughter bought these and I was impressed.

B009GEAPYW|5.0|This is a great start to the dark knight returns. It can't possibly get better until part 2 at least.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|It's an Aerosmith. The power of the group is the same, after all that time (since 1973). It's a pleasure to hear Steven's voice still in force.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Simple put: this book is wonderful. It is a must for anyone that enjoy dream with manned missions to Mars. Clear and well crafted, this book show us what the life can be on such extreme situation. In the same line of Mars Trilogy (Kim Stanley Robinson, 2009) here the author spare a long time in details about the technology and science background required to bring credibility to his adventure.<br /><br />Been a sci-fi story, one cannot expect too much about complex character development and this book not provide it. Mark Watney is a eternal calm, logical, well trained astronaut that always do what he need to do without fall in despair or stress even when he is left alone in Mars for about two years. However good sci-fi (good hard sci-fi in fact) is all about credible science foundation and not too much about anything else. In this regard The Martian is without doubt a very good hard-like-rock sci-fi story.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is my go-to app for all music now.  Once you go Amazon, you can't go back... or something like that.  Great product....easy to use... have some issuesa saving mp3s to my SD card on my phone.....so I just save them like normal, then use a file manager app to move them where I actually want them :p
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I did like this book.  It would be more helpful for a social worker or an educator than a parent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first of three book series.  I flew through these books without catching my breath.  An absolutely fascinating concept you can only imagine and pray never happens.
B007SGM084|5.0|By far some of the best books I've ever read! Would recommend to everyone. If you are thinking about reading it do it!
B00846REIS|2.0|If you have read 50 shades of grey, then there is no point in reading this. The story line is very similar. In 50 shades of grey, it was about two different types of people and falling in love and finding a balance of what each needs. In bared to you its about both individuals being messed up. Meh.... tomatto tomatto.. I mean seriously there was a line that discussed Gideon's grey scarf.  Its pathetic when an author writes a book sooo similar to a book that was popular for quite some time.
B00559BSXO|5.0|Elvis Gold Records collection. Great set for the big fan or begining Elvis fan. Keep it in the car for when nothing good is on the radio.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I'm just a long time Star Trek fan.  Especially the later movies and series that have better graphics and video technology.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Only about half was through but love the way the author keeps you wondering and flipping pages.  The homework was definitely done on this one.  You are right there with him through all the ingenuity this stranded traveler comes up with.
B002MW50KO|5.0|It is the most unique Christmas album I own. No other album is like it. Beautiful it is. My wife likes it too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game and playing it. I like the game and the horses. I wish that I had my own horse the game help too.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|It is a great game I just wish you wouldn't have to pay  everyone should buy it because it's great
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It's a great spy thriller. Would highly recommend this movie and the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Have spent hours and hours going through the free levels - so easy to lose track of time while trying to solve these puzzles. Have to MAKE myself put it down.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|my baby loves it. I received this pretty quick and was very satisfied. this is small and easy to take along with us everywhere.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I recommend everyone to watch this series! It is fun and educational at the same time. The fact that's it Blu-ray makes it even better.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A truly thought provoking game, if it lacks one thing is variety gets a little repetitive bit the excellent sound track makes up for it ten times over
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My husband and I watched Seasons 1 & 2 in three days.  We were hooked and could not stop watching.
1444737112|5.0|I saw this for the first time on Amazon's website and couldn't resist buying it because of the cover picture of Bob.It's a book that's really hard to put down. Bob is a very intelligent caring cat who proves to be a good companion for a homeless street musician recovering from drug addiction. It's a very touching story that tells of the adversities they face together. I understand from checking on line that the book has done well in Britain, being on the best sellers' list for many weeks (deservedly so). I hope their lives are great from now on. I've already ordered a copy as a gift. I know that Mr. Bowen has come out with a book on Bob geared for children. If he writes a follow up on Bob's and his story, I'll certainly look forward to it!
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|Musicality is so much better than in the movie - only wish Ann Hathaway were on this recording. Could listen to this  every day.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The credits and purchases keep getting lost. have lost about 100,000-80,000 credits this week. Please fix and refund<br />If this is fixed 5 stars
B000002UBV|5.0|I always wanted a cassette version of this song.  The tape was sold as used, yet to my surprise I received my tape in shrink wrap.  I noticed a few hours later that there was a crack in the case, which I'm assuming is from USPS.  No big deal.<br /><br />Great sound.  Any noise can be cut out with Dolby B-C.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Every time this movie hits the shelves they sell out, such an amazing movie from such a beautiful mind. my fav muyazaki movie.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|From starting the first book to this, the third, I could not stop reading.  Most of my free time was taken up reading this book.<br /><br />Now that season 3 (HBO series), this book, will start on 31Mar2013, I'm gonna be re-reading this book.<br /><br />Intense, engaging, unpredictable, entertaining, keeps you anxiously awaiting the next thing to happen. Brilliant.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|At first I did not know where this story was going, but it certainly took me to the Pacific. The vivid details brought both Patel and Richard Parker to life. While I won't spoil the ending, it leaves you thinking.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Spend way too  much time assembling the puzzles and increasing to more pieces. Much more convenient than clearing off the dining room table, and you don't have to worry about the cats knocking the pieces on the floor.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It will be hard to top season 2, but its been a good start.. Lookin' forward to see how the group holds up with the new challenges of the Governor and Ghosts from the past.. As Zombies, fade into the back round and the tension rises, I cant wait to see where season 3 will take us. 3 Thumps up!!
B001HQZJPM|5.0|we love these movies so we were glad they came in a nice set together for a killer deal after black friday. Thanks for the awesome item!
B009MO5E10|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />It's hard to find the right term to summarize Premium Rush. One of the film's best qualities is that it's unique. This is definitely something that's never been done before, and if it has I've never seen it. Another solid thing about Premium Rush is that it's fun and it's engaging. There are no firefights, there are no huge explosions, but at the same time it manages to be an adrenaline rush.<br /><br />Premium Rush follows three characters, Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon), and Nima (Jamie Chung), throughout a crazy day that manages to entangle all three of their lives together. Wilee is a bike messenger out of, what seems like, necessity. He can't see himself in an office and he doesn't like suits. Still, the thrill of riding alone isn't enough. Wilee's bike contains no gears and no brake. His bike can't stop, and he doesn't want to.<br /><br />Bobby is an officer for the NYPD who has a pretty bad gambling problem. That's where Nima comes in. Nima is a quite, reserved, woman who works at a college. Her main goal is to import a special package from China. Bobby's sharks tell him that he needs to intercept the ticket that she gave to Wilee if he wants to smooth things out.<br /><br />I wasn't really expecting the film's story to take this route, but I still found it enjoyable. Gordon-Levitt gave another fantastic performance as Wilee. If he keeps this up he's going to have one of the most versatile catalogs in the film business. He isn't afraid to take on a role and it seems to be working in his favor.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to like Shannon's performance I found it to be somewhat forced. I don't know if it was because I didn't like his character, I hated Bobby with a passion, or if I just genuinely did not like his performance, but I didn't find him enjoyable. He isn't terrible and, at times, he does a good job, but his performance isn't consistent. Chung didn't have asbig of a role as the other two main characters, but she delivered in all of her scenes.<br /><br />The only thing that really irritated me about the movie is that, in two scenes, there was conversations between two characters that was all in Chinese. This wouldn't be a problem, but, unlike almost every film ever made, they didn't include subtitles. So the viewer is sitting there like a moron because they have no idea what's being said. In one of the scenes the conversation last at least 90 seconds so it feels awkward for those don't speak, or understand, the language.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - I highly doubt Premium Rush will go down as one of the greatest films ever created. However, while it isn't necessarily jaw-dropping, it manages to keep the viewer interested throughout the entire 90 minutes. I think it could have benefited from a more intricate plot, but I would still recommend watching this if you have the time.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I had heard so much about Downton Abbey but for some reason had never seen it.  I wanted to watch it from the beginning in order to know all the characters and how the story evolved.  It is extremely entertaining, moves at a fast pace and the acting is wonderful.  My favorite is Maggie Smith who delivers such withering looks which complement her clever remarks.  I enjoyed Seasons 1 and 2 so much that I ordered Season 3.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i what this games ples for my sarah murchie stephen gene murchie james tatiana lech mom i love ti so mach
B005HSL626|3.0|Truly a mindless game, and not very enjoyable for someone who has limited eye-hand coordination at best. Could be fun way to pass the time while waiting for a bus, tho.
1433502445|5.0|Very happy with this purchase. Everything I wanted in a quality study bible.  If you  are looking for a new  bible,  you can't  go wrong with this.
030758836X|3.0|I love the voices!  The interior look into the event as the participants act is just wonderful.<br /><br />I really like the up to date swing of the writting.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I only wish that they would have not made it so pretty on the outside ...lol... almost didn't want to open it. Can wait until the second one arrives so we will have the whole set.
B00005LOUP|5.0|had to buy dvd copy cause the vhs finally started wearing out. As soon as the snow flys the kids start asking to watch the Grinch. This is my favorite Jim Carrey movie. He did a great job and its good for kids and adults alike.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I don't know how this guy came up with this story. The detail he goes into is amazing. Of course, it could all be complete B.S. for all I know . But, he seems to know what he's talking about. Anyway, I've never been one to let facts stand in the way of a good story.
B00005JO5L|5.0|What can I say a must have for all who enjoy movies with a gay theme and it's a collector's item I'm very happy again!
1600242405|5.0|This book is exactly what I expected from Keith. A &#34;tell it like it was&#34; story from his earliest days learning guitar, meeting Mick Jagger, and forming The Stones. Of course, most Stones fans have an idea about the bands history, but I really liked how he talked about his personal life and the relationships he had with his family members. How he felt about being an only child through being a father himself. A great read that left me wanting  to hear more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is truly one of the best books I have ever read. I was inspired by the story colleen wrote about hope and how we should never give up no matter how bad our lives get. This really is a must read.. a great romance book as well.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|why don't they tell you that the app does not turn sideways when you turn your kindle. There are some disabled people who can't hold the thing up but must use it in the horizontal position where the wt rest on the holder.
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|On their 14th studio album since starting in 1986, New Jersey natives Yo La Tengo deliver classic<br />  indie pop/rock that's firing on all cylinders, if sometimes purposefully restrained.  The songs have<br />  a rich and saucy subtlety, built around sublimely confident playing and a flawless flow of energy<br />  that's simultaneously mature & sophisticated, fresh & immediate.  From jangly rockers to<br />  embracing ballads with violins, cellos and horns; there's a dreamy, driving stream of natural<br />  warmth and comforting power in the barely-there, emotion-cracked voice and ringing guitar<br />  notes.  Some similarities to  Luna/Dean & Britta, Built To Spill, Galaxie 500, Velvet Underground,<br />  Richard Hawley, Sand Pebbles.  Perfect music for a winter storm or a summer shower.  Nice.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love reding Kate's books.  They are like a good, lazy Saturday afternoon read that takes you out of yourself and the world around you.  A great escape!
B009JBZH54|1.0|So i was really excited when I ordered this trilogy, all three on blu-ray in the same box. kinda hard to miss place one. Well went to put in Batman Begins and it would not play. it would roll through the MPAA rating then it would cut to black and freeze up my blu-ray player. I ordered a replacement and I just got it in today and Batman Begins would also not work again!!! I'm done with trying with this box set. It seems like less difficulty to just buy all three individually. Don't get this box set unless you like all the hassle of returning over and over again.....
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Since I moved I can't get TV where I live so Tuesday morning I watch Castle on my laptop.  It's a ritual and all know don't disturb me Tuesday morning.  It use to be don't call from 9-10 on Monday night.  It has been a long time since there has been as rewarding a show as Castle.  Everyone connected with it is to be applauded from the script girl and drivers to the writers, directors, and leads.. Truly well done.  I own all the seasons and often run my own marathon.  Can't wait for 5 to come out,  already have it ordered.  I might add, being a great grand mother, this show appeals to all age groups.  There is something there for everyone.  Thanks again for giving us something to look at that is worth our time..

B00AXVH8KQ|5.0|2nd release from duo living in New York & Olympia, Washington--indie rock<br />  meets 70s soft rock with a gently twisted tongue-in-cheek core, bubbling in a psychedelic pop<br />  cauldron of humor, melody and harmony-drenched retro-weirdness.  There is a strange and<br />  slightly sleazy sense of bluesy R&B garage art-rock here too, often obscured by layers of sweet,<br />  messy, beautiful folky pop.  The songs are played with a quasi-reverent respect for their original<br />  source of influence, in a celebratory party atmosphere where swagger & smugness only add to<br />  the mystery.  Is it a joke, or are we the joke?  I hear bits of Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones,<br />  Syd Barrett, Free Energy, Night Moves, Blank Realm, Pigeonhed.  At first listen, it seems a little<br />  trite, but there's a creeping notion that a lot is happening under the surface here.  Further<br />  investigative listening is required & desired(and ultimately rewarded).
0345803485|5.0|I love this book!! I could not put it down!! So sexy and exhilarating!!! I am just starting the second book and am still loving it, best book I've read in a very long time.

B00008YZYM|4.0|I bought this movie because its a 90s classic and I couldn't find it anywhere for rent because it is so outdated. I wanted it to watch with my family and keep around since our last copy was a VHS. When the movie arrived it came in a box that wasn't in pristine condition. When I opened it the DVD fell out and had scratches on it. However I watched it with my family last night and we had no problems with it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love kindle on my phone. Don't need to spend two hundred on a kindle, I have my books in my pocket wherever I go. Love it. Wish the page turning was more animated like nook

B000002JEV|5.0|This CD had such a neat picture of all the guys on it. Just had to get it. Inside there are 2 CDs that have lots of their best songs on. I was drawn to this one because of that picture. There are many reasons to get a CD and although I love all the Zeppelin songs this is what made me get it in the first place. Happy with the service here from Zoverstocks.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Amazing and incredible story. Wish the story was longer, so I could continue to dream with a open mind. Thanks
B003KRJNBW|5.0|First its Denzel.... I mean you cant go wrong with Denzel. Throw in Gary Oldman, some good action and a great plot and you have one good movie!

1594203334|5.0|I have recommended this book to at least 4 mothers in my work area.  I found this book interesting and insightful.  I like the writing style as it really helped me to understand the sometimes stark differences between Americans and Parisians wehn they raise their children.  Great book.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|For me, that already listen Beatles at 60's  and listened too others works of remasterizing of big bands,<br />this is the better !!!<br />Finaly,... they didn't modify the beauty of harmony of the original  cd records.<br />You need take this and the others  Remastereds Beatles' CDs.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like this game, but I've accumulated thousands of coins and when I look to see if I can upgrade my runner, my coins are mostly gone. I don't know if its a glitch or what but I want my coins back! I cant upgrade anything. also I'm on a kindle fire.
B009R8DJ72|1.0|THIS BOOK SUCKS! IT TALKS ABOUT A BOY WHO DOESN'T EVEN WEAR PROPER CLOTHES. MY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT TO BUY IT<br />1Out of5
B0015AARJI|4.0|My four stars are not for this particular controller, but the 3 others I've had to buy over the past couple of years.  These only seem to last 12 months before they start to break down with only limited gameplay.<br /><br />This was shipped on time and works as advertised.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is a must read!  It won't take you long because you will not want to put it down!  I highly recommend it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's amazing you can keep your mind on buying other characters and love them it's the same thing I've always love the way it was created
B000002P2W|4.0|This comments aren't of a music's critic.<br />I only suggest to you.  Listen THE WHO, they are uniques  - A legend of rock.<br />My favourity album is  Who's Next, but this are very good too.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Enjoyable  a fan of Johnny Cash depicts his life well also Joaquin Phoenix played the part well all in all a great film
B008220C38|1.0|I was so eager to get this movie that I ordered it before viewing it. Luckily I was able to stop the order after seeing it On Demand.  What a horrific representation of Tolstoy's masterpiece.  Be ready for a bizarre ride.  Not only does the director try far too hard to approach it in a unique and original fashion (stages, sets, slow or frozen actors, behind the stage scenes, etc.) they completely destroy the story. Anyone going into this without having read the book will have no idea what is going on and instead of feeling compassion for Anna one only feels contempt and very little sorrow in her last act, as she is more like Madame Bovary than Tolstoy's tragic heroine.<br /><br />Important things missing...here are just a few!<br />Anna being married to someone far older than her.  An arranged marriage, not a love one.<br />Anna trying desperately NOT to get involved or compromise herself, hence the heroine.  Kiera Knightley's version makes her very little less than a common prostitute rather than fateful star-crossed lovers.<br />Kitty being ill, kitty being heartbroken, Kitty rising above her station, lowering herself because of love and compassion.<br />Levin trying to figure out the meaning of life.  Levin's brother being washed not because he was sick, but because he was dying and his body was being prepared before the priest came to give last rites.<br />Sad abandonment of any &#34;Beautiful Corners&#34; where Icons are placed for prayers in each household.<br />No scenes of marriages in the Orthodox Church and who will raise their candle the highest.<br />No explanation of why Anna is taking morphine and why it gets out of hand.  Not enough of her unbearable grief being parted from her son.  BTW...does she even care about her daughter??<br />The worker who sees Anna kill herself and the candle that goes out.<br /><br />The list goes on.  Glad we only paid a few dollars to view this for the next 2 days.  Gorgeous costumes and lushness, but no story to back itup.  Get the version with Sophie Marceau or the PBS one if you want to see the heartbreaking story Tolstoy meant to portray.
B007THA4FI|5.0|First time through I felt it was a good book.  Second time through I got a much better grasp of the personalities of the varous characters.  Third time through I realized what an amazing job Rawlings had done to interweave the lives of  all these evolving (or increasingly static) personalities.  On the fourth time through I am simply enjoying the book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just go into settings and enter your favorite locations.  You are good to go!  Has all the info I want and much more.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|This movie is quite steamy. I did enjoy the views of Rome (when they were out of the bedroom), and would have liked to have seen more of the city.
B000002NZO|5.0|Trespass must be listened for everyone that apreciatte progressive rock.<br />Genesis, at a moment where was a unknow group, already showed a amazing capacity to conduct ours minds and ears<br />to a emotional trip.<br />The sucess for they was a predictable consequence.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a family-friendly time passing video game.....lots of fun good characters fun upgrades and much much more.................lots of fun you must play it
1451648537|2.0|So the book has no real insights on the man.  It does run through the highlights of his amazing career, jumping from product release to product release while skipping over the dull years.  But one can't help but feel let down that the author had death-bed access and yet still wrote such a shallow biography.  The writing style was also very poor and frequently repetitive.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Can not get enough of this app. It is a breeze to use. I have changed almost every picture on my tablet with Photo Editor+
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, I just wish it were easier to get more gold without having to pay. Still fun though, I love how many different kinds of dragons there are.
B00A8ZZ3CM|4.0|As always Helloween, great speed metal, slow, and pure heavy songs in one great album cant get better than that.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Bought this for a family member and I have to say we all enjoyed it. Good price low price also.
0060254920|5.0|I loved this book as a child and I now read it to my son.....it is beautifully made, and a cute story about using your imagination
0385535147|1.0|I've read every one of Grisham's books and can't even believe how disappointed I was.  The worst book he's ever written!  This goes in the recycle bag - wouldn't waste the space on the bookshelf.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Just like the first book, Beautiful Darkness kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. I simply couldn't put it down.

B00A861QMM|3.0|This has the potential to be areally good game, but it has some major flaws. Most of the objects in the HO scenes are so blurry or blobby that you are only guessing when you touch one that it may actually be what you hope it is! Why so indistinct? It's one thing to hide an object well, but quite another to make it unrecognizable! BG noises in HO scenes are just irritating. I play a lot of these games. Some are total rip-offs, some are really good, a few are Great; but many, like this one, are sadly disappointing.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Big surprise...another great hidden object game coming out of Bigfish!! This game<br /><br />has an amazing story line. And great graphics to go with it. The ending leaves you wanting more so while some ppl are disappointed, I am anxiously awaiting the next chapter!!
B00887490Y|1.0|I did not like this movie....who was the Tall Man?  Movie made no sense and was a little confusing.  I love Jessica Biel but this was the worst movie I seen her in.
B002TQKS14|5.0|This is a wonderfully enlightening, well written book about how we got to where we are with regard to what we eat, and what we can do about it to improve our lives.  I learned so much about how food is grown, processed and prepared and absolutely loved the section about Polyface farm, a sustainable farm we should all hope to get our food from in the future.  You're not a true 'foodie' if you haven't read this and armed yourself with its insight.  It's very readable as well as informative.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My two year old loves this movie!! He isn't much of a talker but when we went to the zoo, he saw a blue macaw and got all excited! He jumped up and down and said &#34;Blu Blu&#34; He  is gonna get a plush Blu for Easter now lol! we have seen it a hundred times already. I keep showing it to people who have never seen it. This movie gets you dancing, singing, and has a great story.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Wow, those sounds really are relaxing. I love being able to mix my own sounds to choose from. Yes it PUT me to sleep. Had to get a little use to it but it worked.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Very nice app.  wish you could sync between devices....oh well ..nicely developed and laid out. Works well on the K fire
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Has great religious value. Would tell others to buy it. High quality picture, and sound. Well acted, showing Christian integrity !!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Sent this to my neice as a gift and she was just tickled pink to have it and watch it! :-) Now her collection is complete!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book and I am going to pick it for my next book club.  Such a great story of love and friendship where you least expect it!  Couldn't put this book down!
B007VDN1PA|1.0|I literally just received this item that I had to wait two weeks for. I was very excited, only to be immediately disappointed. I don't know if mine is defective but, when I put the negatives and slides into the machine it just looks like a non-developed negative, it shows a red tint. There is no color picture, rendering it completely pointless. When I take the negatives out the screen is red, so I'm wondering if the screen is messed up. Either way, I'll be returning it. It would have been great if the picture had worked the way it was supposed to :(
B00632HWOG|5.0|Nice having it in my kindle fire tablet. Yahoo will always be a part of my family of devices. It's always worth the download.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is great! Don't be discouraged by the 1 star crappy reviews, get it. This game is great, and I allways play it in my spare time.<br />I was reading some of the low reviews and a few caught my eye. These said that their child unknowingly made purchaces in game.<br />Being a player of this game I know, there is no way to accidentally buy things, unless you are a kid, witch I can understand. You need to go into the shop and click treasure where it says the prices at the bottom. It confirms you want to Buy it multiple times, and it charges that ammount.<br />Plus if you check the FAQ other people have had this problem. The game does NOT charge without your permission and you vcan also put in a PIM to make sure your kids don't charge you for in game money.<br />This game is the best one on my phone. It's a fun way to use spare time when I'm not at school or asleep. I love this game and spend hours on it. If I love this game, so will your kids.<br /><br />Written by a picky 13 year old.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was great from start to finish on my kindle fire HD. Great story, great game play, some parts actually sent chills up my spine. I hope part 2 comes out sooner rather then later!
B000FC146C|5.0|I chose this rating because a great book. Enjoyed the book as much as the movie. I still cry. Excellent
B0063IH60K|3.0|no problems so far but a little concerned from other reviews ive seen and dont like the<br />ads. will be watching to make sure of any problems.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|We took our 2 daughters, ages 11 and 13 to see this movie.  I'll be honest, the girls chose this movie, as it was not my first pick to see.  I expected a re-make of Snow White to a more up-dated version to be a bit challenging to watch, at the very least.<br /><br />Our girls and my husband and I absolutely loved this movie!!  We could hardly wait for it to be released for purchase, and added it to our growing video library.<br /><br />The special effects in this movie are nothing short of spectacular!  The make-up and body and facial changes they created for Charlise Theron were unbelievable.  She really made her character come to life, and so  believable, that everyone despised her.<br /><br />The creatures in the forest were amazing to watch, both in the dark forest, and in the magical one.<br /><br />Tons of action constantly, and every character was so remarkable, and had a definite purpose and place in the movie.<br /><br />The movie was sad, humerous, adventurous, mysterious, romantic, magical, action packed, etc......it has it all!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for tweens, teens, young adults, and the young at heart. It is a movie you can watch over and over, and continue to find things you missed seeing the first time you viewed it.<br /><br />Everyone was talking about the movie as they left the theatre.  It is one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time!  Well worth the movie tickets, and purchase!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My friend downloaded this for himself and he really enjoys the game app. It keeps him entertained and me sain til he's done. :)
1452111014|5.0|One of my favorite from my collection of &#34;The Art Of...&#34;<br />The research behind this movie is amazing!<br />Love it!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|My granddaughter was staying with us and rented this movie. I cannot rate it and she is not available to do so.
1599290642|5.0|I love these books and if you're anything like me....love science fiction art then you'll love it too.  There are many artists some brand new to the industry and some older more well known.  The book is stocked full of art and the size of the book is very nice....typcial coffee table size book.  I wish they would make the book a little bigger if I'm wishing for anything at all.  There's plenty to read as well in the beginning of the book; other new art books, comics, popular items and a list of artists who passed away the year prior.  Like I said this book just gets better every year.  I think it gets longer as well.  More and more artists recognize the value of being in this book.  They list all the websites for the artists in the back of the book and what could be better advertisement for all the products you might have to sell.  I've found some excellent artists I never knew existed....visited their website to find even more awesome artwork to see by then have bought some to hang in my office.  Love this book keep up the exceptional work!
B005H5H3LW|2.0|Good special effects. Nice story, different slightly than the animated one but you probably already know that.<br />Sure could benefit form a bit of editing. Looooong dramatic pauses, relatively poor acting, at over two hours I would have though a bit more action would have been possible but this wasn't made in the USA by Mr Bay.
B000SGGUWS|3.0|I love the series it I'm not as crazy about the book, I guess if I had started on the books first I may eel differently.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this is a nice calculator. Not complicated just a decent CAL.app. for everyday tasks. I use it at work and grocery shopping.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is really cool and much better than temple run. I wish we could run on train lines and collect coins and fly on jet packs in real life !!!!!
0140143505|3.0|Pleasant, made me laugh. Glad I read it with Q's Legacy. Not a page turner. Makes you feel good about how people can help each other even when times are bad.
B000K4X2UQ|5.0|This is a classic live album by Whitesnake. It also contains their Live...At Hammersmith. So you get more vintage live Snake then you bargained for. Back in my younger days I use to listen to this album over and over, It's That Good!
B008ULRY78|5.0|Finally an over the top action film! A realistic premise that allows for the development and exploration of a savage violent confrontation.<br />This film delivers in the bullets and bare hands fight scenes. Finally knife fighting is shown in its' true barbaric reality.<br />This absolute high testosterone, manly man film shows what happens when an SWAT team is sent in to deal w/ hardened criminals.<br />Finally the question of \\"What would real combat look like when men are actually fighting for their lives?\\"<br />At some points, over the top and unrealistic but overall very satisfying. This film delivers! I am curious what other films these fellow have made.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very helpful for maintaining the files and folders as there is no utility software available as part of the android os for the kindle fire.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|But I figured I didn't need it since I already have an alarm clock. It is a nice looking app, and has sounds to relax you,but honestly it sounds like the radio is not on station. I don't need any help getting frazzled thank you. Try it free if you can deal.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Very good one of the best books I have ever read. I wish to continue reading this great series woow
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think that the ability to play offline is awesome. The uniqueness of thus game compared to others us the reason why I gave it five stars.
B000005RS6|5.0|If you don't like this live album by Deep Purple you must not like great guitar playing. Steve Morse proves through out that he is a great guitar player. Check out Black Knight for proof. This is a highly recommened album.
B006S08RLU|5.0|I loved this movie. It was really strange and awkward which kept me interested in it the whole time. It's a very sweet movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works and is sturdier than the original data cables at a great price. Several cables are useful as more interfaces to devices accumulate.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Th is was an amazing  book, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves success. Have fun with this book
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love this app. Finally found the jigsaw fun I was looking for on the Kindle Fire for free! Have not had problems other reviewers mentioned. But I also don't purchase games, I'm cheap that way! :) The sound is easily turned off and stays off. I have on a few times accidentally touched the \\"BUY STUFF HERE\\" narrow panel that is on the side, but easily exited out of it without losing the puzzle I was doing. If you have very large fingers or play on a small screen I can see where this might be a frequent annoyance. The games comes with a set of puzzles already installed. Then I was pleased to discover there are additional puzzles that can be downloaded for free. Of course, when looking for the free puzzles, first you have to scroll past the ones for sell. You can choose to use the rotate puzzle pieces button; I haven't used it. I enjoy the puzzles as set. You can exit the app and it will save your unfinished puzzle. There are three preset selections to choose the number of pieces you want in the puzzle. So, each puzzle could be done three different times and not be the same puzzle. There is an option to have the pieces ramdomly laid out or you can select the border pieces and work it first! It took me several days of play before I noticed that option. I enjoy this game and look forward to relaxing in the evening and working a puzzle (and not bending over the table getting a backache)!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|After watching season 1 & 2, we immediately bought season 3 & finished watching.  Can't wait for more & hope there's many more seasons to come!
B00005RIKI|5.0|One of the great ones!!  Skynyrd  music is as much a part of America as Football.  If you love great American Rock and Roll you will know what I mean when you listen to this album.  It does take you back to a time when this country was awsome to grow up in.  We have lost something that is for sure.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Everything is changing in the world of James Bond. &#34;Q&#34; is a younger man with young ideas, and &#34;M&#34; begins to feel the years as she (played by Judi Dench) does battle with Parliament to defend her inability to arrest a modern day computer attack by an MI-6 agent from the past.<br /><br />Silva (played by Javier Bardem) is the antagonistic former MI-6 agent whose genius causes security havoc and forces &#34;M&#34; to relocate the agency. These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee.<br /><br />At this point and like it or not, there is only one man she can trust: James Bond, as he takes to the shadows--aided only by field agent Eve Moneypenney (Naomie Harris).<br /><br />A great continuum.

B008HT4FUW|5.0|Late comers to the party, we purchased season 1 & 2, then immediately got season 3.  We finished watching them all the night before the season 3 finale on PBS.  We prefer watching the entire set rather than wait week to week, season to season.  Downton Abbey is the best period piece to come along in years.  The cast is beyond good. Keep giving us new seasons PLEASE! As soon as they are available to purchase, we'll certainly continue to buy them.
B00000JNO1|4.0|Skynyrd is the best, and this album does nothing to change that.  If you are a fan of great story telling rock and roll this is a must buy, as well as all of there early stuff.

Following a long you cant help but think this character is such an idiot.  It reminded me a bit of get smart.  The movie was fast paced and just great fun to watch.

B00000JNO2|5.0|I feel this album is better than Pronounced and Second Helping.  Ronnies lyrics are amazing and the music is amazing.  I would have loved to seen Ronnie and the band live back in the day, but I was just a couple years to young.  I have grown up on this music and still love it today.
B00594XOZU|1.0|KIK is awesome, but it's scary. I loved it at the beginning and then I started getting messages from my friend that she didn't know what I was talking about. They were some scary messages to like &quot;I know where you live&quot; and &quot;I'm at your house right now&quot;. So the only problem to me is maybe hacking issues,And yes I'm positive it wasn't her she is not that type of person she actually got scared to.
B004EPZ03O|2.0|Love the Muppets. Couldn't wait to see this one. Glad I did. Cute movie.    HOWEVER.    The DVD itself sucked.  The viewer is more or less forced into watching what seems like 20 minutes of commercials and trailers before you see the main menu.  (I say \\"more or less\\" because you have to make a rather ambiguous selection as soon as it starts, if you guess wrong, then you get commercials which are unskippable once started.)    Then, once you get to the menu, that's it.  No extras, no bloopers, trailers, behind the scenes, tributes to Jim Henson, or anything.  Apparently you have to buy the Blu-Ray for that? I'm not really sure, but as a huge fan of the Muppets, that was pretty disappointing.    However. The film itself was fun, lots of harmless double-entendres and cameos to keep the grownups happy, and songs and jokes for the kids too.  Lots of \\"meta\\" humor as well which I thought was fun.  Scenes like this in the beginning of the film: \\"So, Kermit, do you think we can do it?\\"  \\"No. Absolutely not.\\"  \\"Wow, this is going to be a really short movie...\\"    Eh. Get it. Enjoy it. For $5 you can't go wrong with this version. For $20, it's a disappointment.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I like this product, true to description, stays on by Bugaboo, coffee cups fit a little too tight, but that's a good thing<br />One drawback - the only zipped pocket is made of mesh. So I can not put money or cell phone there when it is raining or snowing outside. I realize that many people don't need to stroll when the weather is bad, but in some climates you have bad weather pretty much all the time, and I guess Diono, as a company coming from Washington state, should be aware of that :)<br />So I wish that had two pockets, one with mesh and one solid. Otherwise - a good deal, much better use of money than Bugaboo's genuine cupholder.

B000W8HC8I|5.0|I am re-writing my review of this non-fiction book since sharing my own experieneces with this firm seems to have upset Mr. C. in New Jersey.  I agree it was not appropriate to add my material to the review, but my intention was only to demonstrate what I had experienced, and I don't want to take away from what this particular book is all about.<br /><br />In 1995, I worked as a cold caller for Stratton Oakmont.  I feel this book demonstrates exactly what the atmosphere was like while working at the firm the six months that I did.<br /><br />The non-fiction work goes on to describe the boistrous, noxious atmosphere--it was very much like being inside of \\"The Sopranos.\\"<br /><br />The author describes himself as being lured into the business by a Wall Street Slickster, and shares how he was drawn in very deep into a world of criminal activities involvling IPO's.  Namley, he describes his drug-hazed advertures (or misadvertures)<br />and growing lust for greed.<br /><br />The redeeming point or bright spot always seems to be his wife, \\"The Dutchess,\\" whom he goes into great detail about their personal life and decribes the feelings he had for her.<br /><br />I also found his maid a very amusing character--a transport in from Georgia.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at what went on behind the scenes at the infamous Stratton Oakmont.  I feel the reader will find value in learning how life unfolds, transpires, and takes us down a path we don't expect; thoroughly entertaining and un-put-downable.<br /><br />My perception:  The leaders of Stratton Oakmont sold everyone a dream; both the employees and the investors.  It was the dream of being rich.  It was a dream people wanted to believe in.  The brokers and cold callers came in each day hanging on to the dream that they would 'catch the whale' one day.  Investors bought IPO's in hopes of hitting something big. It truly was 'selling fairy dust.'<br /><br />Really good book and worth while--every bit of it was true. Especially the part about FBI agent Coleman.  Of this, I am certain.specially the part about FBI agent Coleman.  Of this, I am certain.

B00AREIAI8|2.0|Heres the deal. The app was great at first. Fun interactive etc. Then suddenly they started bombarding it with adds. Excessively!!! And right in the middle of games and competitions!! And then they prevented users from re-rating the app afterwards. I had to sign in to amazon.com directly to change my rating. It is a great game with a great concept. But their new approach to advertising has slowed the server and half the time I have to restart my kindle for it to even load. My daughter has accidently installed 2 apps just from the random popups. I'm uninstalling the game until these things change.

B00AJLHULW|4.0|I can't say I've been too keen on Robben Ford in the past, he's obviously a very capable guitarist but for me he's always lacked that extra something to take him to the next level. However, I do quite like this album, I think it has a good overall feel and most of the tracks seem to hang together, with Robben's guitar and vocals taking centre stage but with the keyboards of Larry Goldings and trombonist (!) Steve Baxter also adding to the mix, together with the rhythm section of Harvey Mason and David Piltch. It's certainly a diverse selection of songs, from Charley Patton's \\"Bird's Nest Bound\\" to Bob Dylan's \\"Most Likely You Go Your Way\\" to Allen Toussaint's \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\" but Robben and the band manage to meld them all to their jazzy style. Although he apparently used only one guitar on the session, the 1963 Epiphone Riviera shown on the cover which he kept on the 'rhythm' pickup, his guitar playing certainly sounds good throughout and he can dig in for solos when required. I wasn't too keen on the instrumental \\"On That Morning\\" which I thought was overlong and I thought that the old Charles Brown song \\"Fool's Paradise\\" was a bit too slick but the rest of the songs I thought were nice and varied, with my favourites being \\"Oh Virginia\\" and \\"Fairchild\\"

B004J4WLB4|1.0|Are you looking for your next terrible read? Course you aren't. This book is not worth your time! Dreary read with an unlikeable protagonist. It's odd because she seems so intelligent about flowers but completely oblivious to everything else. Her ignorance is to such an extreme that I was irritated with her the entire time. I know the author was tryimg to stress a point but goodness gracious she went overboard! I would not recommend this to anyone. It was a complete waste of money and time.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|There is so much hype regarding the Oscars now that viewing any of the contenders is met with confusion. That is unfair to each of the films because it automatically places each in a police lineup for who is going to win. ARGO is a solid film based on a true incident and the significance of that very important mission to free hostages is one equally share with our good friends the Canadians. That is what makes this film important - the courage and fortitude shared in freeing 6 American citizens form a near hopeless situation. But on to the film itself.<br /><br />In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (played by Ben Affleck) devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts (John Goodman and Alan Arkin, both brilliant in their comedic roles), Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves.<br /><br />The film opens with a brief but well edited history of the fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of the Khomeini, actual footage that lends a sense of credibility form the start. For the first hour of the film the plans are set into motion - plans that seem absurdly Hollywood but the options are non-existent. Once the actual exfil mission is begun the film become tense and suspenseful and the cast of characters selected to show both the resistance of the home front and the terrifying situation happening to the hostages in the shelter of the home of the Canadian ambassador makes this a finely tuned thriller.<br /><br />The cast of actors includes, in addition to Affleck, Arkin and Goodman, strong work from Victor Garber who plays the Canadian ambassador, and Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Rory Cochrane, Christopher Denham, Kerry Bish&eacute;, Kyle Chandler, and Chris Messina. Though the film was basically shot here in the US (with a bit of footage in Istanbul, Turkey) the action appears authentic. The film was written by Chris Terrio but based on the book \\"The Master of Disguise by Antonio J. Mendez and Escape for Tehran by Joshuah Bearman. Affleck directs, produces and stars. ARGO is an important film to see, a slid movie on its own rights, but is it the best film of the year?  Check the competition.

It's one of the best games, and I was thankful to be able to download the Ad-Free version so I could stop putting my phone into Airplane mode to avoid those pesky ads.  Beat every single level with 3 stars, can't wait for more levels/versions to be added to the AB family.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Most movies about alcoholics show us the downward spiral; some show the process of recovery.  OK, fine; we know what we're getting into.<br /><br />But this movie is incurably dishonest about addiction.<br /><br />First, a pilot who's drunk is not going to perform a miraculous, highly creative and physically coordinated landing of a fatally damaged plane.  If being drunk made you a better driver, there'd be no such thing as a DUI.  This kind of presentation is exactly what makes drunks feel empowered to go out and prove how heroically and well they drive while loaded.  (That said, the landing sequence is the best part of the movie - really exciting and well-filmed.)<br /><br />The secondary story of the adorable nubile prostitute who miraculously recovers from her heroin addiction in two weeks - clutching a copy of the Big Book to her chest and enabling the pilot when he's passed out drunk - is preposterous.  Perhaps - am I  pushing it here? - the girlie crap/love-interest stuff in this film (beginning with the opening sequence) is there to titillate, and not to advance the story in any kind of honest way?<br /><br />The final scene, which seems to be an attempt to impose meaning on all this disorder, rings entirely false.  A guy who's been lying his way through his life - an addict - is unlikely to behave that way under public pressure.<br /><br />There's one thing that I learned from this movie:  when your plane's crashing, it's not safe to get up and move about the cabin, just like they always say.  ;-)<br /><br />Denzel's character's brief hard-drinking turn in the excellent *Courage Under Fire* is a much more realistic portrayal of why and how people drink, and why they come to believe they need to stop. (Matt Damon's performance as a heroin addict in that movie is also worth mentioning.)

B00AQ71FLK|2.0|would be nice game if not UI issues such as<br />- moving camera sometimes cancels movement, so when you trying to kite enemy, your char would stop, it causes deaths and annoyance.<br />- sometimes taping screen calls menu window, even though you were tapping nowhere near to menu button. deaths, annoyance<br />and prime time loss of connection is just annoying, I use stable wifi connection yet it will show me reconnect window every now and then
B00AJLHUA8|2.0|I love supernatural thrillers, but this one disappoints.  It borrows way heavily from its predecessors - the struggling writer whose work threatens his family life, the supportive wife who eventually questions his judgment, the creepy old Super-8 films that the police haven't managed to find even though they're in plain sight in a creepy attic, the child who turns out to be scarier than you'd think - it's all there.<br /><br />The ripoff Diane Arbus uncanny-kids-in-the-hallway shot is provided at no extra charge.<br /><br />If you've already seen the other good supernatural thrillers, nothing in this will surprise or scare you. Even the half-heartedly-kicking legs of the hanging victims - supposed to provide a violent shock - seem improbable and unlikely. ;-)<br /><br />And then there's the improbabilities of the plot, setting, and photography.  Gee, moving to a house where a murder has taken place - that's really going to be motivating for writing.  Why doesn't this guy ever turn on the lights?  Even daylight shots are dark, as though the cinematographer doesn't know how to handle light exposure. And why doesn't Deputy So-and-So have an actual name?  And why is the otherwise intelligent Ms. Rylance such a nauseating coffee-making pushover?<br /><br />Our hero is adamant that he does not want to waste his great talent writing college textbooks.  About three-quarters of the way through this movie, which I diligently finished, I was hoping he'd sign a contract with Pearson Education.<br /><br />The film is so cheaply made that the scenes with the requisite local-college-professor-who-happens-to-be-an-expert-on-ancient-Babylon-and-paranormal-stuff-in-general are done via computer interview.  We're supposed to think this is because our alcoholic hero is isolating, but it's just as likely that this technique was used so that the Apple product-placement that's prominent throughout the movie can be better forced on viewers.<br /><br />Bennington College should probably sue these folks for appropriating one of their t-shirts.<br /><br />For recent supernatural-thriller movies, I'd suggest Insidious, Two Sisters, or Apartment 143 as an alternative to this schlock.these folks for appropriating one of their t-shirts.<br /><br />For recent supernatural-thriller movies, I'd suggest Insidious, Two Sisters, or Apartment 143 as an alternative to this schlock.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I purchased this for my father, he's really into the 'sci-fi' type of movies. I don't think he blinked a single time while watching this movie, almost instantly in love with it.  I don't personally think I ever watched more than 10 minutes of it, but every person I've ever spoken to about the movie said they were in love with it.

B0052CK5PQ|3.0|I feel like Moran uses her self applied title of 'Strident Feminist' as a crutch to justify not getting bikini waxes or wanting to wear thongs. Boring! We've heard it all before.<br /><br />An entertaining read, no doubt, but more so for the anecdotes than her views on feminism.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|This game is cute and fun and educational. It is a tile laying game, with strategy. You have choices as to what to do your next turn. The weather dice is a nice flair to a bonus benefit on your turn. So do you move the farmer or the panda or lay a tile or water a tile. I love the selection of play and the verity of what your next choice is. And the game is so cute.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|As funny as the original American Pie. would definitely recommend this comedy if you liked the original movie. Buy it now.

B003E20ZQA|5.0|Such a beautiful story, such a fabulous setting, I was glued to this book from start to finish. Patti Smith and Robert Maplethorpe led a fascinating life through one of the most intriguing eras. A 'must read' for anyone who loves early American punk.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My kids and I love this version. Frankly, I get tired of the green pigs and the idea of releasing the exotic &#34;Rio&#34; birds is cute and different in a welcomed way! They don't even play the original anymore.

B005VPRFSY|4.0|Build quality: 3.5, Theme quality: 4.5<br /><br />Overall, this was a good set. Both the swoop bike and the escape pod are relatively simple to build and highly detailed. Both are also extremely durable, which is crucial for younger children. I was disappointed to find that the escape pod was missing a grey hooked attachment piece. However, this part is not essential to the build in general. In terms of mini-figures, this model really excels, as both sandtroopers and the new detailed C-3P0 are all unique to the set.<br /><br />At 137 pieces, this set is relatively inexpensive, especially considering the 3 unique mini-figures. Also this set would work very well in combination with some other larger sets, specifically the Millennium Falcon 7965, which omits both C-3P0 and R2-D2. All things considered, I would recommend this set, as it is well worth its cheap price.

B008M0NDOK|4.0|It was just what I was looking for. It only gets four stars because there are so few games that use it and Gameloft's newest FPS shooter is not compatible with it, which makes no sense. With limited games it could be cheaper too. But if you have the right games it is great!
078689136X|5.0|The characters are great and you get so involved so quickly.<br />Had me guess the wrong murderer a few times. LOVED it.
B004GJYROG|5.0|One of the best movies of all time!!! Watched this as a kid and will continue watching this with my children for years to come!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really nice app that works graet.  i can't believe that it is free. try it. you will love it.<br />  does everything i need.
B004I1K2NW|5.0|I love this movie so of course I am going to give it five stars. The DVD itself had no scratches or issues on the disc.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book, the characters came to life as the story progressed.  There was love, hate, murder, incest it goes on and on.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a fantastic book and the author is  fantastic. I recommend that you read this book . It is really good. Read this book please.
B002TO1Z8Q|3.0|The picture was not as crisp as I would have liked but as background music and images it's okay.  I wonder if we are all spoilt by Blu-Ray and 3D.
B008NQYWC0|4.0|I loved this book from the beginning. I was hooked by King's incredible ability to draw the reader into the story from the very first sentence. The premise is interesting. He lays out the details in a fashion that makes an obviously fictional activity (time-travel) seem completely plausible. I found myself wrapped up in the lives of the characters. The book is long enough to give you time to be invested in the characters and almost forget Jake's inevitable return to the present.<br />I so thoroughly enjoyed this book right up until half way through chapter 30. I was ready to give it a three star review because of my disappointment with the ending. But, it was somewhat redeemed in the Final Notes chapter.<br />I could not buy into the idea that the world had changed so drastically for the negative when Jake saved JFK. I certainly expected big changes but I would have like it better if Jake had to make a tougher moral decision to reset the past to save Sadie or leave the changes he made because the world was a better place. I felt like Jake had no real decision at all.<br />Despite my disappointment, King is an extraordinary storyteller. My husband has been telling me this for years. I will definitely read more from him. I just plan to stay away from his more notorious works. JTM
B0039SFKSW|4.0|Good CD.  There are some great songs on here that bring back the Asia of old: Finger on the Trigger, Holy War, I Believe, and Listen Children.  This Cd led to a good live one as well.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Excelente producto, de buena calidad, cumplió mis expectativas, se los remiendo a todos para que disfruten de tan buen producto
1594744769|3.0|A little dissapointing. I was expecting a little more. It was rather slow, great idea, could have been developed more.
0465092764|4.0|Good book.  Elucidating subjects like this is not easy.  Most readers will be well educated and the interested ones will welcome a deeper explanation than was provided.  The avoid-equations phobia is way overdone in current popular science writing.  If John Derbyshire can explain Riemann to the educated public Woit could have done equally well with a bit more effort.  Still it was a much needed and fairly well written book.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|All I can really say is that you have to read the book. It was a different read for me, but not bad at all.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This is truely one if the original classic sci/fi movies everyone needs in there library. Robby the robot is the best.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Great way to pass a few minutes waiting for someone while shopping, etc. The graphics are amazing. The way it rotates is fun.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I picked up this book because it was 99 cents.  It was a great story!!  I found myself laughing out loud several times.  I read it in one day--it was worth more than 99 cents.  Can't wait to see what he writes next.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free Flow is a great app. It's premise is simple enough to be quickly understood and with the varying degrees of difficulty it's enjoyable for all ages.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|this handy little sharpener is easy to use and self-explanatory. However it almost feels TOO small even in my hands and mine are rather tiny.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|It is one of the best interpretations and production of the Bach Cantatas I can imagine.<br /><br />I am extremely pleased
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Of all the horror films that came out last year, one in particular stood out from all the rest, Sinister. The movie was built around a creepy atmosphere that would not let up till the very end. The usage of 8mm found footage had some of the most effect use of disturbed images that linger in your mind as you are watching them. What interested me most about the film was how the writers decided not to give away too much of who Mr. Boogie was. The twists throughout the film were great and had some originality to them. Even if there are some cliched moments in the film the overall enjoyment is taken from the intrigue into the mysterious entity known as Mr. Boogie. I highly recommend this film and would definitely say buy this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works smoothly and price is right.  I like the Hint feature.  Can't believe I miss so many plays....Guess it comes with age.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|This movie retells the beginning of the evangelion story, but cuts out a lot of the dragging parts. It also contains the first big plot twist.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's great fast paced and adventurous. I guess I'd say it's about for ages 9 & up for some kids but DEFINATELY for 11 year olds no matter what. It's good for grownups too.
0307730697|5.0|“Fearless - the true story of a man named Adam Brown- and how he went from an adventurous child to daredevil teen, from a drug-addict adult, to a man with a goal and mission: becoming a Navy SEAL. He was a man of extremes, whose courage and determination was fueled by faith, family, and the love of a woman. It’s about a man who waged a war against his own worst impulses and persevered to reach the top tier of the U.S. military. Always the first to volunteer for the most dangerous assignments, Adam’s final act of bravery led to the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Fearless is the type of book that you will not soon forget. This is the kind of book every man needs to read. I found it to be a fitting tribute to an American hero, as well as a reminder to all of us that life is very brief.<br />After reading this book it left me with this thought: &#34;How do I want to be remembered when someone writes my life story? And when they read it, will they see God through the pages?”
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It was great.  It is so wonderful to own it so I can play whenever I want. Great story line.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Probably one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life. Everyone needs to read this book at least once!
B005LAII94|2.0|Forced acting that didnt seem natural except the \\"hippie\\" dude, didnt much enjoy it. A few good undertones about the DEA and entire drug scene but otherwise poorly executed. I also really disliked the woman playing the main role.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|There is something earthy and spirit-touching about this album. The songs are great as background music and to sing along too. I sometimes have it play on my Kindle while I work in the office as it is not distracting. And it is awesome to play in the car too because everyone likes it.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|when I got coin dozed it looked fun but when I tried it I realized it was the boringest game ever
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I bought this for a good friend who absolutely loves everything about nightmare before christmas.  He loved this and I'm sure he is still loving it! makes a great gift.
1426308469|5.0|I bought this book for my 3 1/2 year old son.  This is organized by dinosaur size and each dinosaur gets its own page ( well 2, 1 for illustrations and 1 for content). There is a short paragraph about each dinosaur that offers some interesting/ important details that are perfect for pre-schoolers. This book includes a variety of nonfiction text features ( map, index, table of contents, etc). We read about 2-3 dinosaurs per night. Very easy task with the organization of the text. Oh, they tell you how to pronounce each dinosaur's name. This has been my son' s favorite book for 2 months straight!
B00AHSINKO|5.0|This is a very touching movie that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. The story moves along well and the characters are well-developed. The story of a couple yearning for intimacy is very relatable. I don't want to give away the plot line here but will add that the movie does not quite take the expected turn that a viewer imagines and that makes it all the better.
B004XANKVO|4.0|Likes:<br />- Very well built<br />- Good materials<br />- Unbelievable warranty<br />- Convenient compartments with well protections. Nice pocket for my Macbook Pro 17, iPad 3, mouse, etc.<br />- Very roomy. I now can travel light with just one bag<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- The opening between the main package and the ads-on doesn't look right. In the picture it hugs perfectly but mine has a big gap and I don't like it. I would give this a 5 stars if it's not because of this.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Neon Genesis Evangelion one of the best series on anime ever to be released to begin with. This is a must buy. Has similarities to the original series, but has new surprises and twists.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This application is simple enough for this 60 year-old to use. It has everything needed for most any problem, unless you are into physics or other advanced math. For the average person, it is quite sufficient.
B0086700CM|4.0|I wish I could understand why a game where the character runs an seemingly unending obstacle course is entertaining, but I cannot. It is a lot of fun. And addictive. Happily it does not take much skill to get the hang of how it works, but getting the hang of it does not equal success. The game still requires attention to detail and anticipation of the next steps to take. I play it on my Kindle Fire and really like it.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I really like every single tracks. It is vivacious and full of life. I listen to this CD when I go to the gym.  It pumps me up with energy and it makes my exercise session go so smoothly.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This thing works wonderfully, both the way it revolves, and the strap for easy handling. I do wish it was 100% real genuine leather and not pu leather but this was the best one I could find for such a low price. I would recommend to friends and family.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|ive gotten every song name i have wanted to know and it hasnt failed me yet! i definetly recommend it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was awesome and do you know what's weird I'm only 9 and this book is for middle school it is a really good book if you like action and romance books and I have something to say to Suzanne Collins what's it like to be so a genius and fyi I'm the biggest fan of the hunger games if you think you are a bigger fan than me your loocko crazy and if you think your not crazy  than why are you even reading my opinion and the books nobody's crazier than me oh and once your done reading this go to YouTube and look up a bad lip reading hunger games
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|interesting premise...but not a very good movie...fast forwarded a lot...dont waste your money.<br />it seems like a B movie written by the same person as Twilight....over a weekend...not impressed.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|es muy bueno obtuve muy buenos resultados silencioso y 12 grados por debajo de lo anterior con el disipador original solo me dio ligeros problemas con el tamaño al colocar el segundo abanico.
0451232852|5.0|Follet does it again!<br /><br />Very entertaining, couldn't put it down. Gives a great sense of the life in each part of the world and the social class, including points of view.<br /><br />Best of both worlds. Very entertaining and you learn, awesome!
0062103377|5.0|This was a very interesting book. I couldn't put it down. It let you in on some background and made sense of some present issues. This is a HAVE TO HAVE for any Supernatural reader/fan.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Another awesome series brought to a pre-mature end by the short-sighted Excutives of our &#34;Entertainment&#34; World!  It is a shame such shows are dropped.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the same as Imagi Studios' Temple Run. You are someone running from something dodging obstacles and earning points and getting new upgrades.
1401924751|5.0|As usual, Ms. Doreen Virtue has created a beautiful set of Oracle cards.  I haven't used them yet to answer a question, but I laid out the cards in a pattern that seemed meaningful to me, and all of the cards were relevant to my life.  I went through them all to enjoy the pictures and vibrations.<br /><br />A professional reader could probably get much more out of them for appropriate clients.  I don't use cards in my sessions.  I've always thought the small booklets in the various Oracle decks are helpful.  The same is true of Life Purpose Oracle Cards.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|For everybody that likes Kelly Clarkson music and video..this is the best product...I recommend you,you are to enjoy with the songs.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|Nerf continues producing overpriced, cheaply engineered products.  Moreover, the product picture showed a full contingent of magazines (actually they placed them all on the photo side which left the other magazine slots empty.  Nerf wants to you buy a lot of additional accessories in order to complete the image presented.  In short, we will NEVER buy another Nerf. My son has several and most work only a limited time and then they are useless.  Don't buy the Hail-fire and get your child something that works.
1416511946|5.0|This book takes the meaning of sex, drugs, & rock n roll to a new level! Definitely worth the read.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|The movie \\"Fight Club\\" is a very respectable movie. It puts you inside the mind of a psychopath who doesn't know what he's doing when he goes to sleep. He creates a whole life in his split personality and becomes the leader of a \\"tightly regimented organization\\". I would have given 4 stars but I'm satisfied with the 3 and a 1/2 stars it received. Great movie
0062101897|5.0|It was the best Christmas gift to my daughter, she is a Harry Potter fan,she  was very very happy when she received it.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|The Affair feels like the prequel to end the series.<br /><br />Our much beloved Reacher, known so well from the fifteen previous novels, is pictured by Lee Child back in uniform, on his last case prior to being demobbed.<br /><br />There are enough little details for those who are au fair with Reacher's quirks to see how this rounds out the character ... Perhaps as Childs puts Reacher out to pasture (or the open road) for good.<br /><br />This novel, more than many other Reacher tales, kept me guessing on who was actually in the wrong ... reacher, the hot ex-marine lady-sheriff, or someone else in uniform.  Cracking stuff.<br /><br />I'll never hear a big heavy freight train go past without thinking of Sheriff Devereaux.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like 50 shades this is the book for you!!! I can't wait to start book 2. Gideon or Gray???
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am enjoying every bit of it.....not fully utilized as the moment as I have lesser gears than it can take.  I am so glad I got it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  Love the whole series. The book was so much better than the movie.  I was really disappointed in the movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a awesome game. Makes me and my brother bond<br />I never played a game like this. Please make more games like this.[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! It's easy to use and the numbers are a good size which also makes it easy to use. I use it when balancing my checkbook.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I bought this kindle version for a class read aloud and it is perfect.  The story is great and I had no problems with delivery or the product.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book.  Love the whole series. I hope when they do the movie it is better than the first movie.  I find the book is always better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game and my daughter really loves playing, but not as much as I do!!! I always wanted a horse as a child and now I do.

030758836X|1.0|Cant believe I stuck with it to the end and wasted all the time when I could of been reading a good book.  The ending was a slap in the face.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.  Love the whole series. I hope when they do the movie it is better than the first movie.  I find the book is always better.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is one of my favorite classic books, and had the pleasure of reading it a few years ago. I am happy to have a copy of it on my kindle now to take with me always.
B0027PNRG0|4.0|I've heard David Sedaris on Public Radio and enjoy his stories.  The book is good to have around when you need a smile.
0345803493|5.0|Goes a step further than book 1.  Writing style a bit repetitive.  Story line a bit predictable but interesting nevertheless.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I love Ellen, but this book was disappointing. I thought the book was going to be about her life. The book is really just a lot of jokes and one liners.  I'm sure the jokes are funny when heard/seen in person, but it doesn't come across funny when reading. I'm disappointed in the book, but I still love Ellen.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|What more can I really say about this book? It is a classic and is an excellent read! Although I like hardcopies better than kindle books, this has been perfect while I have been abroad.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed the book. Just enough intrigue to keep me interested and reading. Would like to read more by this author.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Best Christmas Movie Ever! If you haven't seen Elf... well you need to ASAP. Even if it isn't Christmas, just watch it.<br /><br />We have the tradition to watch it every Christmas day... never gets old!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|My wife picked out this movie on amazon on demand (I wanted to Expendibles 2) and I figured I would watch a few minutes than read a book while she finished it.  I ended up watching the whole thing and to my dismay I enjoyed it.  Let me start off if you like Wes Anderson movies than you are getting more of the same however it would rank on the bottem of his list.  The movie itself is to lack a better word cute.  It moves at a steady pace, you never laugh out loud but you do smile throughout and at the end you appreciate it for what it is a simple nice movie to pass away a lazy evening at home.<br /><br />The movie centers around two children aged 12 who choose to run away together on a small island.  For a moment I thought this was going to be an updated Blue Lagoon but that just for a few moments.  Both children have an interesting back story and their desire for one another is amusing.  The strength of the movie is the supporting actors eveyone from the scout master, the scouts, the girls parents (bill murray) and the police officer looking for them (bruce willis) contribute to this movie which is heavy on dialouge but lacks any real action scenes.<br /><br />I was very surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie but feel strongly that it would make a good date night movie for just about anyone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am really enjoying using this app. It's fun to play and the one tap feature makes it quick and easy to use. At times it's frustrating,but mostly it's fun. Logging in a lot of hours playing it this holiday! The only frustrating thing for me is the fact that it tries to sell me an alternative app at the start of every individual game!
B009DJB8I2|1.0|GET IT FREE AT from thinkwithportals . com STRAIGHT FROM VALVE... UNLESS YOU WANT THE PHYSICAL COPY, THERE IS IS NO NEED TO BUY IT! LOL
B000YHG72E|5.0|This flick has everything!  Comedy, romance, fairytale, lessons....... it's great for adults and children,  I cry every time I see it, and love to show it to people who have never seen it before because it is a 100% sure thing.  And I love watching it over and over again!
