B00DC7N9NS|1.0|It had no bearing on the little girl Dorithy from Kansas and her dog Toto, no scare crow, no tin man, nor a courageous Lion. not even the song follow the yellow brick road. An then when you took my Milas  and made her look that bad.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I loved the scenes and the actors were great. story line was pretty decent and special fx were on point. great overall.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|I have the zenpinball 2 tables on every device I can, my PSvita, WiiU and now the kindle Fire. It runs great on the Kindle Fire I am very happy with it. I wish a more entertaining table came with the overall Marvel Pinball package as you have to buy additional tables and I personally am not a fan of the one it comes with. (Though from professional reviews I seem to be the minority in that)
1843560267|5.0|I used it in my Aristotle class and it was great aid in translating. Overall great lexicon for Greek. Love it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is a lot like the game of Bejeweled and I really like playing this on my desktop. Thank you
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Now Sonic the hedgehog is the best mascot gamer to ever exist. Sonic CD was suppose to be the spin off of the first Sonic the hedgehog game. The sets company split into two because of a fight. So side A made Sonic 2 with tails. Now Side B didn't know anything about tails so that is why in the original he was not in it following you. most people don't know this. Now then, the game is amazing. Sonic has still and always will beat Mario. It's final, and this game proves it as well.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|again the QoSA go a new direction with the big driving sound that we all love and expect from them. heady lyrics, melodic rifts ,and the twist of changing timing. the singing .. well is on a level that most just wish to get to. what you get in 30 min is more than most bands give in two of their best albums. every song takes you to a great place. an in depth escape form the regular drone you hear today. you will not be left with anything less than a big smile. enjoy!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this is the best racing game on the Android Market. it has provided me with something to do  countless times and is definitely worth downloading.
0446364495|1.0|I love romance novels and have read them for thirty years.  Bridges, I know romance novels and you are no romance novel.  Any romance novelist would be laughed out of the industry if he or she wrote such turbid terrible sappy prose.  I can't imagine how anyone can read this book.  The characters are sociopathic, the writing unbelievably bad and the plot non-existant.  Not recommended.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Like the black & white ribbons on the performers this is a wonderfully woven and well told story right up to the last page. I could not put it down. This author does an excellent job of building a world that I really loved being a part of and like the characters in the book I was reluctant to leave at the end.
B0081336FO|5.0|I loved these shows. Great modern interpretation of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.  Based on the classic stories with excellent acting.
1908117230|3.0|On the bad side: I was so excited to get this book and learn some secrets from the master only to find that I followed and did a more thorough recipe than him for the shells, which he mentions and gives directions to his Italian Meringue recipe. With a very basic technique and approach.  I expected something much more refined and explained. Also all of his recipes seem to be dependant on using really really exotic ingredients (and by the way he gives directions on where do they sale this exotic pleasantries).<br /><br />On the good side: Not everything is lost in here, the combinations of flavor are exquisite, and some ideas are very good borderlining in crunchy delicious well thought and studied textures. The illustrations are vivid works of art which inflame the eye.<br /><br />Buy only if you are a fan, but not if you want to learn the secrets of macaron making
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman, you continue to fascinate me.  I was absorbed into this world where the ordinary is enchanted and melded into a young person's life.  Childhood fears of loss and monsters and how we grow into good people are woven into a story that is simple and complicated.
B00065MDRW|5.0|1969's \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\", is a classic in the progressive-rock field.  1969 gave us a slew of progressive music, my favorites that year were, The Moody Blues, Audience and The Move's \\"Shazam\\".  Robert Fripp is the leader of King Crimson, he brought along bassist, vocalist Greg Lake,  drummer Michael Giles and keyboardist,woodwinds player Ian McDonald (who later was in Foreigner).  This album has only 5 songs, but that was enough, on this disc you the smothering \\"21st Schizoid Man\\", Lake never sounded so mental!  The placid ballad \\"I Talk To The Wind\\",  the Moody Blues sounding \\"Epitaph/March For No Reason/ Tomorrow And Tomorrow\\", Lake sounds perfect here.  \\"Moonchild\\", took years for me to enjoy this tune, but it finely sunk in, then you get the great title track.  44 minutes of classic King Crimson.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a great game but ever since the new update  i can not copy a friends map this is my review so please consider
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Fun and Quirky.  Light-hearted!  Only and hour long which is great since we don't watch TV very much.  Nothing objectionable!  family entertainment in the 1st Season.  Maybe not for real little children.

B001NLL93W|5.0|This book is good clean fun a real page turner. The characters have good story lines and it keeps you guessing
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Frankly, I was surprised at how professionally and understandingly this film was handled. The truth is that there are two sides to this story: Hungry people demanding cheap food & those who supply our food!<br />  There are too many people in the world and we are wiping out our natural resources. With this in mind,  there are bound to be &#34;problems&#34; in/with a system that is forced to supply massive amounts of food-and then pushed to make it &#34;cheap&#34; as well. So this film quite proficiently hits these issues and manages to try to give life to both sides. The slant against corporations is both reasonable and a bit tough. The truth is that our family farmers could no longer feed the world with organic technology. The romantic notion of going back to horses & oxen pulling plows vs. or not using fossil fuels and toxic chemicals dies a bit harder with each new life people choose to bring in to the world.<br />  There is a section on how the animals are raised before being slaughtered that is quite vivid and rather rough for young people to watch. I found myself at the edge of tears. There is a cruelty involved, furthered along by watching illegal immigrants kicking some of the chickens that get in their way. But then, &#34;we the people&#34; are still demanding fast food, fresh food, cheap food...and this is how it is made.<br />  One issue that came up in the movie that should make freedom lovers grimace, was the part about corporations/corporate lobbyists now passing bills that outlaw filming of such enterprises, encourage corp. lawsuits against individuals who speak out and (in many cases) forcing family farmers out of business/off of their lands by setting them up for mass sales and then pinning them down with large debt and the threat of pulling said business from them if they do not concede.<br />  Overall, this documentary will not leave you smiling over the state of our food supply, but then again, a little reality goes a long way. And if you live in a city, I question how you would raise your own &#34;fast food&#34; beef, poultry & pork-perhaps in a darkened, sound-proofed garage?<br />  Consider this film a wake up call-human egos vs. human survival...a city, I question how you would raise your own &#34;fast food&#34; beef, poultry & pork-perhaps in a darkened, sound-proofed garage?<br />  Consider this film a wake up call-human egos vs. human survival...
B008QMMEOE|3.0|Its ok - a lot of times the pieces don't lock in when my son hovers over where they should go.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|Its very exciting and entertaining for someone like me who loves action movies and weather. Great buy for weather enthusiastic s.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|My 3 yr old son likes it. Plays it and likes jumping on monster heads to crush them. Thanks for reading.

B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a good game.  Not too hard but not too easy either. Have not had any issues with it so far.  Like!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Very well written book and very exciting. I cannot wait to read the rest of t his series. Loved the book.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I'm always wary of books that seem to have been hyped too much, but I'm glad I gave Wool a chance. This was a truly original and inventive book, with a great narrative voice. Honestly, one of the best things I've read this year.
B000VZSOI4|1.0|I ordered the Real Book in book form and got a cd rom instead. I need this for a gig...I don't have time for this crap. Now I have to buy it again!!!
B00A7CI82I|2.0|Having enjoyed the previous Bourne films, I was expecting to find this latest instalment to be at least passable. How wrong I was! The actors were fine, but the plot was paper-thin. Spoilers ahead. It takes ages to get going, and then it drops everything in order to have two characters run off to find an injection, while some South Korean guy starts chasing them. There's an over-long chase, before finally the 'heroes' end up safe on a boat, and suddenly the woman is staring longingly into the guy's eyes like a simpering fool. Oh, and Edward Norton is wasted in a role that isn't even afforded a reaction shot when his plans are defeated. It's been a long time since I was this disappointed by a film.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|From the intro to the final words, WWZ takes you on a geopolitical roller coaster that is real and intense. There are moments so vividly described that you can truly imagine this actually took place. Fiction is supposed to transport you, but Max Brooks paints a clear picture of what a contagion could do to our world, and it scared the living daylights out of me! This was a beautiful narrative that should be shared and discussed for decades to come.
B004G7UTXG|1.0|We had to stop watching about 30 minutes in because the sound quality was so poor - the voices were garbled and unintelligible. The movie seemed great but I guess we'll never know for sure.
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|There is nothing new in this video.  It is a cut and paste of many other moves, videos.  Stronger acting would have helped!
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Really enjoyable to watch, something special.  I recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates good quality intelligent shows.  It's relaxing and fun at the same time.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|This is the only downfall of this particular VOD &#34;movie&#34;.  I have to assume that now I have seen the best there is to see and have to accept that I may never again be so completely drawn into anything on my tv screen again.<br /><br />The Cirque is spectacular, no, that really doesn't cut it.  It's infinitely awe inspiring.  I personally have never been able to sit through what I would classify as a &#34;musical&#34;.  (In my personal vernacular, that is anything set to music without character spoken word)  I've sat through this twice and if I could stay up a second longer I'd thoroughly enjoy to &#34;sit through&#34; it again.<br /><br />The visuals are breathtaking, the performers are just WOW, did I mention WOW?  Yeah like WOW.<br /><br />If you want a vacation from the ho-hum and hum-drum of pop culture tv, movies then you have to watch this.  What an escape, an adventure and a joy to watch!  Kudos and multiple thumbs up.<br /><br />Love it.<br /><br />Love love...<br /><br />LOVE<br /><br />Ok I'm done now....<br /><br />LOVE<br /><br />Fine really done.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|It was almost like goin' home and catchin' up with the boys. BUT...............who are these ole boys? They are all so old now! So I figure I should look in the mirror and see if I've got the wrinkles and other signs of ageing, oh and Lord have mercy I don't recognize the old man lookin' back at me in the mirror! We are all in our late sixties or early 70's. There's Bruce Willis, Arnold &#34;ah ll be back&#34; Schwarzenegger,  Sylvester &#34;Rocky&#34; Stallone, Jason &#34;The Transporter&#34; Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Liam Hemsworth, Scott Adkins, Yu Nan, and Jean-Claude Van Damme. A lot of nostalgia, this is the kind of movie that gets a cult following! Try it, you'll love it.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Very easy to learn, anyone can pick this game up and start playing right away. They have two expansions that really mix things up! I would highly recomend looking into them.

B009WUBERW|4.0|This movie will never win an Academy Award for Best Picture, but it was entertaining and surprisingly moving in a few parts. It's great to see this motley group of action heros (mostly aged) in action. Look forward to seeing the next one!
0425263924|5.0|This book answers so many questions that the first two books left you with.  It was a quick read and I can't wait for the next one.

B00AB7IA1S|4.0|I'm giving this app four stars instead of the three I kind of want to give it, because it does keep my attention long enough that I know I'll keep it on my kindle to complete it.<br /><br />The gameplay is good (if a bit simple). The goal is to take your hot air balloon from point a to point b (the little buildings) by using different kinds of fans. The arrows on the bottom indicates the direction of air flow for each fan. I do like the camera rotation, which is pressing your finger and sliding it to move the picture then using two fingers to rotate the picture--both, thankfully, work headache free. Once again, until I get my kindle fixed, I can't comment on sound. I did see that in some places, the game won't allow you to place fans (in places that the fan could go).<br /><br />The levels, supposedly, get harder as you play--I'm going through the second levels, so I'm not sure on the truth of that, yet (though I can see that the second set of levels are a bit harder than the first, though not by a lot). So far, though, the levels are still pretty easy and require little thinking. I'll stick the game through to the end and see if the levels are any harder later on (I'll add an update to my review if they are).<br /><br />A very big, big plus, the turtorials are great to understanding the game and are helpful. A downside, though I don't have sound for this game at the moment, I wish the in play options would include a way to mute the sound. The only way to do this is in the main main and level screen. There's also a hint button that's infinite in its usage if you need to use them. The graphics are great, and I see no problems on my kindle fire.<br /><br />There's no rewards (like points or stars) in completing a level other than unlocking the next one--so there's no incentive to play other than completing all levels. I also would like to see something indicating that I've completed a level. When you get to the next levels that branch off, you don't have to complete them both. So, if I wanted to go back and complete the ones I didn't do later on, there's no way to tell if I completed the extra level or not. I don't really see much point in there being an undo button, as in, if you crash or mess up, all you have to press is the hammer button to edit (if you crash). Then, all you do is touch the fans to move or delete them.<br /><br />(EDIT, I just saw that a completed vs. unlocked level are the same color, but the unlocked one is slightly dimmer--it's a lot easier to see if you dim the brightness on your device.)<br /><br />Overall, a simple though (can be) fun puzzle game. For $1 and with all the levels it is worth the money (even if it does get a bit repetitive). However, if you're looking for a real challenging game, I probably would save your money.hem both.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game, now I know why my friends recommended this. The colors of the tiles are easy on the eyes, making it very pleasant.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I love this series.  I have not been disappointed about any of the books. The author has a way of holding your attention and keeping it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder was a great book to be read. I gave it five stars, because it was a truly exceptional experience to read this book. I absolutely loved how each person had their point of view, and I really loved the introspection from all of the characters. I would defiantly recommend this book to a younger audience, although it speaks to all ages. To let younger kids read this book, it would teach them that you should accept someone  by who they are as a person, not their image.<br /><br />The definition of deformed is someone who cannot walk someone who cannot talk. But this boy's face Is no deformality. It is a wonder.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|The game is fun. Needs more floors. Each room is different and a little harder as you go to the next level
B007LGPSX0|5.0|IT's great re-living that time, but frustrated that only season 1 was free. The other seasons had a fee per episode.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is a creative fun way to share pictures with friends. I had no troubles with it. This is the perfect app I highly recommend this app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was such a phenomenal story that really grips your attention, as well as your heart strings! It was incredible!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging enough to keep it interesting but not too much to get you frustrated. Only has 10 levels for free version so I'm sure for the gifted, you'll have more to look forward to in terms of harder puzzles &amp; mystery.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the gaffits are amsome it is better then any other game or running game I think it have the nice touch with the minions
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love that I can save multiple locations to check on family. Shows multiple screen updates and love the weather alerts.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I read the book after watching the movie because I liked the story so much.  The idea of pursuing the idealogical and life truths as a young man hits home with me. Harmonizing religions and ideologies in to the core truth for what it is and not understanding why people focus more on the differences than the similarities. The truth lies within the mosaic of fabricated stories and actual moralities just as the ancient books that religions are based upon. The story told in the Life of Pi is one that does make one believe in something or someone bigger than us all. That being said, I respect the words on the pages but it turned into a laboring read for me about 3/4 of the way through. Kind of like any religious book. The story still interesting, full of life but all the truths twisted and burdened with metaphorical meanings and emotions fabricated to cover something else up, a horrible truth. Laboring to tell the truth with twists and turns therefore hiding the truth.  By the end, I felt like the Japanese men sent to get the accounts of how the ship sank. I wanted the story without the fantastica stories of the tiger, orangutan, zebra, etc.  Still I have to say I appreciate the book and story, as well as the cinematic adaptation of the book which is very well done. If you've read the book I'd definitely recommend watching the movie. The cinematic version of the book evoked emotions the book could not for me. I'd recommend it as an interesting read, if you've watched the movie and hoping to relive it, I'd just recommend watching the movie again. It captures the essence of the book well and portrays the story perfectly.

B006H3MIV8|5.0|A very lovely compilation for a very very reasonable price.<br /><br />There are several incredible performances on here that shocked me including (But not limited to) Miley Cyrus's rendition of &#34;You Ain't Going Nowhere&#34;, Ziggy Marley's &#34;Blowing in the Wind&#34; and Pete Seeger doing &#34;Forever Young&#34;.<br /><br />It's a great collection for the Dylan fan, and hey, it's for a good cause too.
0790729393|4.0|This film is good. Great actors. Good storyline although it is quite unbearable at times (I was so angry at their circumstances), but it was a good film to watch.
0316247545|5.0|I got two copies of this book for two big MLP FiM fans..and they loved it.<br /><br />I can say from receiving it that the books are good.  They're small in size, but very compact...and cover nearly all the episodes from what I can tell.  Including lyrics and everything.  A very good book for any MLP fan with stunning quality and attention to detail given to it.<br /><br />Only thing I could add is, they should have added in a CD with songs from the show, that would have made it even better for the fans.
0486278077|5.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is famed playwright Oscar Wilde's only published novel and a gravely interesting one at that. A dark novel regarding man's greedy and shallow desires.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is a man obsessed with his own good-looking face and a picture of himself that an adoring friend created. So much so that he unwittingly sells his soul in a wish to remain as beautiful as the painting, while letting the painting take on his own deterioration.<br /><br />With this lack of outer deterioration, Dorian finds himself growing darker from his lack of soul. He finds the painting growing more and more grotesque as the years progress. The painting has taken on his deeper, disturbing inner-self and he is disgusted by it.<br /><br />Wilde's novel really begs the question \\"What would a man do if it did not affect his outer-beauty?\\" and \\"How much are we putting into our outer beauty whilst neglecting the necessities of our inner-beauty?\\"<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
0316223239|4.0|Initially I didn't think I was going to like this book because I was not initially convinced that Emma would successfully portray the voice of a 5 year old boy to any degree that would be compelling or convincing but I have to admit that Emma did outstanding. A good book will develop a mental picture in your mind of the main character so that as you're reading you picture that character rather than simply hearing dialogue being narrated by the main character and that is exactly how I experienced this book. I guess the only downside is that if this book is ever turned into a movie I just hope Jack looks like my Jack!<br /><br />With that being said, I do feel that the book lost a little bit of momentum halfway through (without going into too much detail and potentially giving away spoilers) I think Emma successfully thought her way through that part of the book and then wasn't sure how to continue the story to create a full-length novel rather than simply a short story.<br /><br />I am wavering between a 3-4 and sitting at a solid 3.5 stars for this book but because her portrayal of Jack as a 5 year old boy is so convincing I have to give her extra credit. I also fell in love with his character and that is not an easy thing to do as an author so I went ahead with the 4 star rating.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|easy to use and lightweight (considering the kindle itself is a bit heavy) i use the case all of the time and you can stand it up so you don't have to hold it.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|It's great to be able to watch these old episodes on my Kindle Fire! The sets are kinda corny by today's standards, but just to watch them again is great!
B002CMQS1O|2.0|I have heard about the movie for years.  I liked certain parts of it, but would prob not sit through it again.  I think it has a niche following though.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|It's odd that I'm jumping right into the controversy surrounding Remote Control Productions on my first review but I figure it's worth addressing right off the bat. Yes, I am a Hans Zimmer fan. Say what you will about how he regards the \\"orchestra\\", his pension for creating \\"new instruments\\", or his team of \\"ghostwriting\\" apprentices but you cannot deny that Hans Zimmer is a reigning force in the film music industry. I do, however, recognize why Zimmer's recent transition towards sound design and clashing and banging does not suit everyone's fancy. If you hold on to the days of John Williams' full-bodied orchestras (there are, luckily, still numerous to be had) and cannot stomach the  brute masculinity and chopping string ostinatos that largely define the music of the modern blockbuster, then Zimmer's recent score for Man of Steel is not for you.<br /><br />  That being said, if you are a Zimmer fan or if you like your themes big, bold and easily identifiable, Man of Steel will likely please. The soundscape that Hans Zimmer has created for Snyder and Goyer's (notice I didn't say Nolan's) Superman is akin to that of The Dark Knight trilogy. The higher octaves that Zimmer explored in cues such as \\"Like A Dog Chasing Cars\\" from The Dark Knight and many from The Dark Knight Rises are much more prominent here, but there is still plenty of brooding and churning in the lower registers to be had. \\"Look to the Stars\\" opens the film in an ethereal landscape with slurred electric guitar pronouncing the first musical identity for Superman soon joined by chorus for the Kryptonian's birth. Following this is \\"Oil Rig\\", one of the more brutal and less-listenable tracks of the score but representing the first you will hear of Zimmer's much touted \\"drum orchestra\\", a collection of famous drummers organized to jack up the intensity. To hear the drum orchestra in a slightly less brutal arrangement, look to \\"Tornado\\". \\"Sent Here for a Reason\\" introduces the Clark Kent theme on solo piano but the theme receives fuller treatment in \\"This Is Clark Kent\\" (a standout) and \\"Earth\\". The latter is the best representation of what Zimmer must have meant when he proclaimed in early interviews that he was going to be playing up the Americana in this score.<br /><br />  The theme for Zod and the battle of Krypton is a progression of synthetic strings that comes across as a little underwhelming at first but builds to such ridiculous proportions that it ultimately wins you over. I absolutely love the track \\"Arcade,\\" the piece that plays during Jor-El's escape on Krypton. Simple yet massively threatening and a good example of the electronic distortions and synthetic effects (a descending ripple, a heavily distorted horn) that Zimmer used to represent Zod and his forces. \\"I Will Find Him\\" and \\"General Zod\\" also feature the same theme and distortions with the former cue giving the drums a little more \\"mmph\\".<br /><br />  Other themes of lesser prominence include the tender, lullaby-like identity for Jor-El and Lara's goodbyes to Kal-El in \\"Goodbye My Son\\", the Jor-El / Zod fight motif nearly straight out of Crysis 2 in \\"Launch\\", and the destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's landing cue in \\"Krypton's Last\\".<br /><br />  Every Zimmer score seems to have that one ridiculously long track and Man of Steel is no exception. If you get the Deluxe Edition, which I recommend if only for \\"Arcade\\", you will get a few of these including Zimmer's synth mock-up titled \\"Original Sketchbook.\\" If not, though, there's always \\"Terraforming\\". A loud action cue worth it mainly for the first minute and a half but listenable for the rest, \\"Terraforming\\" features one of the Superman motifs at the start and a collection of variations on numerous themes throughout its near ten minute runtime. You'll hear a horn motif at 3:43 that seems pretty reminiscent of the mermaid theme from Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and a near copy of that theme on strings at 7:05 with Zimmer's typicalall-male chorus. All in all though, \\"Terraforming\\" is an impressive and raucous cue with some satisfying material.<br /><br />  The latter part of \\"Flight\\" (2:50 onward) contains one of the most rewarding and developed themes for the Man of Steel. Also heard in variation in  \\"If You Love these People\\" during the final fight with Zod, this theme is my favorite of the album. A grander and more fast-paced variation of the theme introduced in \\"Krypton's Last\\", the latter part of \\"Flight\\" and \\"If You Love these People\\" conveys simultaneously Superman's great power and his identity as a loner disconnected from his home world. It accurately conveys the awe of Kal-El's first flight and the final fight with Zod, but at the same time a touch of sorrow. Of the two big renditions of this theme, however,  I have to prefer \\"Flight\\" over \\"If You Love these People\\", if only for the fact that \\"If You Love these People\\" employs the electric guitar in a way that will remind the careful listener a little too much of Drop Zone.<br /><br />  Now for the Superman theme. In the fashion of The Dark Knight, the identity for the hero is simple enough that one may only consider it a series of motifs linked together rather than a full-bodied theme, but Man of Steel offers a bit more intricacy than that prior score. Of course, this is not your John Williams' Superman fanfare. Heard in a bit of a bizarre, slurred electric guitar arrangement after Clark's theme in \\"Flight\\", the theme's most developed and triumphant rendition can be found in \\"What Are You Going to do When You Are Not Saving the World?\\" For most, this will be the standout cue of the album, in which the various Superman motifs come together to create, for the first time, the full theme. Critics of Zimmer will undoubtedly slam this theme for not living up to the Williams fanfare. To meet them in the middle, I will say it's very Zimmer. The synthetic strings do the bulk of the heavy lifting in this track and the percussion slams away in all its glory. But there is something for me about this new Superman and this new theme that makes me love it. Like the rest of this score and the film itself, Zimmer's Superman theme is far from perfect and certainly won't please everyone. Upon first listen, I was even a little disappointed. I had the same reaction to the film, but I kept coming back for more and both the film and score grew on me. Boy did they grow on me. It may be a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure nonetheless.<br /><br />  Go to [...] for more in-depth film score reviews! Happy listening!
1451696191|5.0|Perks of a Wallflower is an excellent book, and only takes about three hours to read.  The central character is absolutely lovable and believable.  He will remind you of yourself when you were 15 -- a naive, introspective, loving kid that gets into trouble, but is unquestionably good at heart.<br /><br />Normally a coming-of-age story intended for young adult readers wouldn't appeal to me.  If someone just summarized the plot to me, I'd think it was sappy or something.  However, I bought this book on a whim at an airport, and thoroughly enjoyed every page.<br /><br />Also, I'd like to point out that this book is masterfully written.  You really honestly feel like you're reading the diary of a fifteen-year-old.  The author replicates the teenage writing style so, so well, but without being distracting.  I really feel the author is a brilliant actor.  The whole book is basically a monologue delivered by a fifteen year old, and the author had to give that character a convincing voice.  At no point in the book does the author lose character.<br /><br />So!  You should read this book a) because it's super enjoyable and b) because it took a lot of skill and creativity to write it.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Needless to say, don't read this unless you've seen the film or you don't care about having twists ruined that will make your inner Trekkie giddy with nostalgic delight....<br /><br />  You won't find another composer out there who is more frequently given the title of \\"the modern John Williams\\" than Michael Giacchino. Of course, John Williams is still the modern day John Williams, but there is certainly some validity to this accolade. Most of you, dear readers, familiar or not with the world of film music, were probably introduced to Giacchino without even knowing it, just as I was. His work on the Medal of Honor videogame series broke new ground for game scoring and gave us one of Playstation's most haunting themes, something that I could recognize and hum long before I began paying attention to film music and knew anything about the men and women behind its composition. Since then, Giacchino has partnered with director/producer J.J. Abrams in a true Spielberg/Williams-esque partnership that has lasted the test of multiple televisions series (Alias, Lost) and numerous feature films (Mission Impossible III, Super 8). While Giacchino has had tremendous success outside of his partnership with Abrams, winning the Oscar for Up and providing a memorable score for the unmemorable John Carter, it is this partnership's outings that fans of the composer most look forward to.<br /><br />  When 2009 came around and J.J. Abrams breathed new life into the Star Trek franchise, Giacchino was along for the ride, providing a fittingly brassy and energetic score with a memorable main theme for the series' new direction. Naturally, this summer's Star Trek Into Darkness (named like a true Giacchino track title) allowed the composer to build upon the foundation he created for the first film and compose an absolutely superb sequel score.<br /><br />  Opening with a noble, solo horn performance of the main theme per the 2009 film, the score soon dives off in a different direction for theNibiru chase in \\"Logos/Pranking the Natives\\". The chase music continues in \\"Spock Drops, Kirk Jumps\\" with brief nods to the main theme. These first two cues really set the pace for the rest of the album. Critics of Into Darkness most often noted the incredibly fast paced nature of the film in comparison to the first entry and Giacchino's score is fittingly subject to that same comparison. We're no longer learning for the first time who these characters are and thus reprisals of their themes are kept to a minimum here.  However, when we are treated to reprisals, they are just that... an absolute treat. \\"Sub Prime Directive\\" is an example of this and is just about as Star Trek '09 as you're going to get on this album. Truly fantastic, this track solidifies the surfacing of the Enterprise as my favorite sequence in the film and sneaks in a much appreciated reference to Alexander Courage's original theme at the same time. Luckily, Giacchino avoids reprising his own theme and its secondary phrases as frequently as he did in Star Trek, his restraint lending the theme an added punch whenever it breaks through (though we could have used some sort of variation when the Enterprise leaves earth to head for Qu'noS, bafflingly spelled \\"Kronos\\" in this entry).<br /><br />  After the film's title, we change gears yet again with \\"London Calling\\", a beautiful piano piece that calls to mind Clint Mansell's work on Last Night and introduces one of Khan's themes. The tracks also features some very light electronics previously absent from the 2009 film, an interesting change for Giacchino. \\"Meld-Merized\\" is a soberingly mournful piece that erupts into one of Khan's themes at 1:50, this one foreboding, infectious, and with a distinct air of Twilight Zone. Like John Williams' Jaws theme, this Khan theme and its variations suggest a lurking, calculating evil and provide a near perfect sense of building dread. This theme is wonderfully melded into a quieter, tenderer variation to make us feel for Trek's greatest villain in \\"Brigadoom\\" just before Giacchino again lets rip with the menace.<br /><br />  Star Trek Into Darkness sees the return of many old faces, not only those of Dr. Carol Marcus and Khan Noonien Singh but also those of the warmongering Klingons. Their faces though are slightly different than when last we saw them and, fittingly, so is their theme. Heard in the lively standout cue \\"The Kronos Wartet\\" the identity for the Klingons is sinister and tribal, complete with a wildly unhinged chorus chanting Klingon obscenities. The Khan-in-action motif that begins later in the track at 4:05 builds to a powerful statement of another Khan theme, this one at once majestic and threatening. The word that comes to mind is \\"conqueror\\". The former motif returns in \\"Ship to Ship\\" with a little added percussion amidst some good filler material for Kirk and Khan's space jump to the USS Vengeance. \\"Earthbound and Down\\" is exciting but ultimately forgettable as far as having any real thematic material goes, a fault that is quickly redeemed in \\"Warp Core Values,\\" an exceptionally beautiful cue for Kirk's sacrifice. The variations on the main theme, the build in the chorus towards the end, and the similarities to George Kirk's sacrifice cue (\\"Labor of Love\\") from the 2009 Star Trek all made this a chill-inducing few minutes in the theater. Really well done.<br /><br />  The kind of soft, tender orchestral writing that Michael Giacchino excelled at in Lost comes through in the next track, \\"Buying the Space Farm\\", but even with our captain dead we aren't given a moment to breathe. \\"The San Fran Hustle\\" offers some of the best chase material on the album (of which there is much), a motif at 1:57 lifted from the classic Trek episode \\"Amok Time\\", and a final grand statement of the Khan theme for the villain's last standoff. Following this is \\"Kirk Enterprises\\", a nice kind of catharsis to all the frenetic action cues preceding it. As in \\"Warp Core Values\\", Giacchino reprises the \\"Labor of Love\\" material in \\"Kirk Enterprises\\" but this time he is much more direct about it. By this approach he effectively communicates to the listener and viewer, \\"Yes indeed... we have come full circle.\\" After this satisfying reprisal, we get a bit of an adventure-on-the-horizon kind of motif at 1:46 that sounds like a nod to the James Horner Star Trek scores of old (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock) and then the iconic Alexander Courage motif underlying what every Trekkie looks forward to: \\"Space, the final frontier\\". All in all, \\"Kirk Enterprises\\" is a great way to end Into Darkness's new material.<br /><br />  With that, Giacchino reprises his main theme from Star Trek in the aptly-named \\"Star Trek Main Theme\\". Not much is different here, with the exception of some altered percussion and the addition of a chorus. Not that I don't love hearing Giacchino's theme, but it would have been nice to forego this track and give us an end credits suite as was done for the 2009 score release. Hopefully, there is a deluxe edition on the horizon. The album ends with a song by Conway entitled \\"The Growl (Bonus Track)\\" that can be heard in the bar scene between Scotty and Keenser. It's kind of catchy and I'm happy they've included it but I wonder if this is really what we'll be listening to in the year 2259.<br /><br />  To sum up, Giacchino has accomplished a wonder with this score. Though the album is still woefully short (we could have used that \\"Ode to Harrison\\" cue that everyone was so in love with weeks before the film's release) the orchestration and mixing is a step up from Star Trek, which suffered from an overly wet mix. If you listen to the score before seeing Into Darkness, you may deem it to be a bit rife with Giacchino action filler but upon seeing the film I can assure you that the themes will come out and you'll realize that this an expertly constructed piece of work and a more than worthy sequel score.<br /><br />Go to [...] for more in-depth soundtrack reviews!

B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|A lot of reviews I'm reading online seem to take the wind out of this album's sails/sales. J. Cole is a thorough lyricist, and a very good producer, and this album came out sounding very well polished. There is much more meat on this project than many that are out and topping the hip-hop charts today.<br /><br />Great sophomore effort, establishing Cole as an All-Star (I didn't say 'Superstar', I didn't say 'Legendary') artist.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am totally hooked on Downton Abbey! Season 3 is packed with drama and complexities, as much or more so than seasons 1 & 2. My only complaint is having to wait until January 2014 for season 4 to begin. In Season 3 Tom struggles to find his place in his dead wife's family, Matthew and Mary long for a child of their own, and Lord Grantham is forced to recognize that life in Downton is changing. Below stairs Mr Bates is home and anxious to resume his duties, but where does that leave Thomas? Alfred and Jimmy compete for the title of &#34;First Footman&#34;, while Daisy continues to try to attract Alfred's attention, although he only has eyes for the new kitchen maid. If you like a soap opera-esque drama with great story lines and 3 dimensional characters, you're going to LOVE Downton Abbey!

The total shows in the top window, BUT!! If you tap the bar below the total it will show you each figure you entered and if it was added, subtracted, multplied etc. It retains a history automatically that you can also clear. It's a lot like having an adding machine without the tape. Just click on the bar to double check to see if you entered everything you needed to. It is a really well designed app if you need a calculator. And it was free!!!

B0018BB20W|5.0|English rockers The Moody Blues released their second album Days Of Future Passed in November of 1967.<br />From 1964 to 1966, The Moody Blues were a different type of band from the one fans would know and love them for. After the failures of their singles after the breakout hit \\"Go Now\\" from 1964 and its debut album The Magnificent Moodies, singer/guitarist Denny Laine and bass player Clint Warwick quit. In turn, they recruited guitarist/singer/songwriter Justin Hayward and bass player/singer/songwriter John Lodge, whom both would be key ingredients to the band's future successes. Along with original members drummer Graeme Edge, flute player/singer Ray Thomas and keyboard player Mike Pinder, the band's classic formation was complete.<br />The new lineup of the band was going to record a rock version of Dvorak's New World Symphony with the London Festival Orchestra, conducted by Peter Knight and produced by Tony Clarke (the sixth unofficial Moody). However, the band changed their plans, and decided to do an entire album with the orchestra! Their plan was a concept album about the day in the life of an average man. Would this album be a classic or written off as tripe, read on and find out as I did in early 2007 on a whim (and would eventually lead me to seek out other albums).<br />The album itself is divided into seven suites clocking in at 41 plus minutes (unheard of by 1967 standards), each of which relates to a different time of the day.<br />We begin the album with \\"The Day Begins\\". The opening track is an orchestral instrumental sequence which helps to set the tone for the rest of the album. Following the instrumental portion of the song, Mike Pinder recites Edge's poem Morning Glory which is excellent. Next is the suite called Dawn which goes by the song \\"Dawn is a Feeling\\" (penned by Pinder). It's a nice slow, melodic, and mature piece of music, whose overall sophistication was well ahead of its time musically. This track features new boy Hayward on lead vocals with Pinder singing the bridge and is a great song. Next is The Morning suite a/k/a \\"Another Morning\\" penned and sung by member Thomas. This is a happy, uplifting orchestral experience and a great song. The first side ended with The Lunch Break suite. The first two minutes of this song are excellent orchestral sounds you've likely come to expect, but then segues into the John Lodge rocker \\"Peak Hour\\" which is a great rocking number (and Lodge would pen more rockers of this magnitude on later albums).<br />We kick side two off with The Afternoon suite. The first half of this suite is the melodic, orchestral pop tune \\"Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)\\" or better known as \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\". The Hayward-penned classic became the band's first big post-Laine hit and rightfully so as it's one of the band's best songs. The second half of the suite is the Lodge penned \\"(Evening) Time To Get Away\\" which is another great song yet sadly overlooked as compared to the track's first half! The sixth suite is called Evening. The first half is \\"The Sunset\\" which was penned and sung by Pinder and a great song. The second half of this piece is Thomas' \\"Twilight Time\\" which is another great piece. We end the album with The Night Suite which consists of the group's biggest hit the band ever had entitled \\"Nights In White Satin\\" which was written and sung by Hayward. The track was not seen as single potential but then first the French and Europeans pushed the song to #1 after the band performed the song live on some TV show then a Seattle DJ wanted to \\"medicate himself\\" so he put the track on and the rest is history. The song would hit #2 in the US in 1972. What an excellent song and ballad. Then as the song ends, we have Edge's \\"Late Lament\\" before ending the album with a monumental bang!<br />Upon its release, Days of Future Passed sold well and eventually went Gold and then eventually hit #2 on the Billboard album chart in 1972. The album was years ahead of its time and was the first rock album to successfully combine rock and roll with classical! Though some now say the lyrics were pretentious and the music sounds dated, the album was revolutionary for its time and (with this remastered version with extra tracks) this album alone (plus the next nine studio albums released after this) should have the band in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Why they aren't in is a cardinal sin.<br />HUGELY RECOMMENDED!ock album to successfully combine rock and roll with classical!

B001ER4CNY|4.0|The show is well written, produced, and directed . The cast has a sparkling chemistry throughout the series. The first year although it has a few inconsistencies in story line continuity is my favorite. The characters are more down to earth and the romance is there. The colorization is seamless. The second year saw the show becoming formularized and departing farther from the confines of a believable reality within its fictional reality. Aside from that each show makes me laugh. It is very similar to the three stooges in that each time you watch the shows, they become funnier knowing what is going to happen and how the characters will react. I just pop in a disk when I want to get away from the seriousness of the day. The show deserves 5 stars but it loses one because of the cheap packaging. It is clever but the cardboard shape of the bottle to hold the disks came apart as soon as I removed it from the plastic case. A little thicker cardboard and some more glue or slot fitted cardboard design would have made this not only a clever design but lasting trophy to display wherever viewing monitors are watched. When I'm done the whole series, I'll have to see if the original black and white season is available and watch that to see what kind of a different mood is created. Thanks goes to Amazon for offering this at a great price!
1936891026|4.0|Resistance, with a capital \\"R\\" according to author Steven Pressfield, is what stands between \\"the life we live, and the unlived life within us.\\" It is Pressfield's aim to help the reader overcome that resistance. The book is divided into three chapters, or \\"books\\": Book One: Resistance: Defining the Enemy; Book Two: Combating Resistance: Turning Pro\\"; and \\"Book Three: Beyond Resistance: Higher Realm.\\" (There is no contents page or index.) Books One and Two are similar in approach. For instance, in Book One, Pressfield writes, \\"The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it. Resistance is experienced as fear...That's why we feel so much Resistance. If it meant nothing to us, there'd be no Resistance\\" (40.) In Book Two, his advice is similar: \\"The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear, then he can do his work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist\\" (79). In the third book, he discusses angels and muses,\\"our allies against Resistance.\\" The practical side of me was suspicious--angels and muses? Why not gods and monsters, or dragons and balrogs, or unicorns and fairies? But then I remembered that Pressfield is the author of \\"The Legend of Bagger Vance.\\" He must be doing something right. And in fact, I discovered a paragraph in the third book that describes a process I, as a playwright, have personally experienced: \\"...when we sit down day after day and keep grinding, something mysterious starts to happen. A process is set in motion by which inevitably and infallibly, heaven comes to our aid\\" (108). Pressfield's ability to fill 165 pages on resistance is impressive, and proof of his own creativity. But much of what he says has been said before. Still, I am satisfied with a book if it gives me even one new way of looking at the world. This book does that, along with confirming some of my beliefs. I would have rated it a 5 ifit had a contents page and index.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you are a fan of Downton, you can't miss this season. If you haven't checked it out yet - start with Season 1. It is truly one of the best shows on television! My only regret is having to wait for Season 4!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Excellent read will read again which is always a good sign.compelling story kept me turning the pages right to the end.
B003OFHMKO|1.0|Shoddy performance or maybe just over my head.  Bound to appeal so some, but for me it is difficult to listen to a rough performance.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor and Park is the story of how two misfit teens of the 1980s fell in love.  Park is a half Korean loner with a good family life.  Eleanor is the oldest of 5 children who live in poverty with her mother and abusive stepfather.  They meet on the bus on the way to school and though it starts out rocky, their friendship begins over a love of comic books and rock music.  It soons turns into an up and down romantic relationship.<br />The author wrote the book in a simple, beautiful way and gives amazing descriptions of how the characters felt.  \\"Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive.\\"  The words will give you that fuzzy feeling in your stomach and you will be rooting for the characters the entire book.  Their romance is fairly innocent but there are a lot of curse words etc., so this would be appropriate for 9th grade +
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a parent, the idea of having to stand by your child in such agonizing circumstances kept me fully engaged at all times.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I got the new update for android. It crashed the system. I went back to the old version and it works fine.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The movie wasn't what we expected but it was very well done, well acted and enjoyable to watch. Glad it was predictable.

1439102813|5.0|Let me begin by saying I do not have, never have had, nor have I ever known anyone with dementia or Alzheimer's.  My very limited knowledge of the disease was not much more than \\"it makes you forget.\\"  When I first started the book, I could not relate at all.  Not having experience with the disease, I found the beginning of the book to contain too much technical jargon and could in no way relate to a Harvard professor.  However, I hate to give up on any book without giving it a \\"fair\\" chance.  It took over 50 pages to hook me, but once it did, it reeled me in and I could not put it down.<br /><br />The book is told in 3rd person, focused on the feelings and thoughts of Alice.  Each chapter is a \\"month\\" of her life.  It begins with outlining her successes, her job, her children, and her relationship with her Harvard professor husband. She is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease at age 50.  The technical jargon and stuffy Harvard persona falls aside and Alice is revealed as the \\"any woman\\" whose life would be stripped away with such a diagnosis.<br /><br />I found it fascinating and frightening how quickly the little things she lost became big things, the change of her temperament, the effect it had on the dynamics of her closest relationships, and not only her deterioration of independence, memory, and thought, but her loss of self.  I learned things I didn't know, such as the possibility of auditory and visual hallucinations and changes in visual perception.<br /><br />I fell in love with Alice, rallied with her through her struggle, and identified with how horrifying, embarrassing, shaming, and terrifying it would be to knowingly, and at times unknowingly, struggle with holding onto every precious moment as long as possible.  I found myself actually hoping Alice would be able to have her \\"big ending.\\"<br /><br />I literally cried the last three chapters - particularly at the speech she gave about what it was like to live with her disease and when she discovered the letter she had written to herself.  This was a magnificent story of a strong and successful woman living with the slow, torturous death sentence of Alzheimer's with courage and dignity.  I am so glad that I continued on.  If you struggle with the beginning, keep going.
B008JFUQ16|4.0|Better than the first - but that's not such a high bar to leap. I liked the themes about career villain trying to be good daddy, and the kids trying to decide his love life for him (\\"[[ASIN:B008Y7GQ72 Sleepless In Seattle]]\\" anyone?). And, possibly because of her red hair, [[ASIN:B008KZX7W0 I Love Lucy]] almost as much as Gru does - even if those spiky heels seem improbable for a female action/adventure character. But, with plenty of slapstick, some incredibly cute kids, a psycho over-protective daddy, and low expectations, this was a more than adequate way to spend time with a tweenage girl.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
1572816295|4.0|This deck has very beautiful artwork in bright & pastel colors. The images are very detailed, with all the traditional tarot symbols & the artist's own creativity enhancing them. A good deck for the novice & advanced reader alike.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|good movie was well written,the 3d copy that I had was very enjoyable to watch well put together movies had a lot of special affects but this is what made the movies good
B008KYOCA2|4.0|It was quick to load.  The only problem I am having is deleting mistakes, but I only &#34;played&#34; with it for a little while.  It is clean looking and easy to use.  Love the graphics, would like to see more.
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|good movie well done,had  a good plot that made enjoyable to watch,worth the watching ,different from the first one but just as enjoyable
B005XUC398|4.0|Dramatized though it is, for the moment, Margin Call has a place in our pop-contemporary history movie collection as we try to figure out whether to blame ourselves or everyone else for Ye Olde Recession of 2008.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's fun but not too easy. Makes you have to think a little! A good exercise for your brain and I recommend it.
157421327X|4.0|The book is wonderful but a little too basic for what I was looking for.  I kept it and will look for another to buy.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Just plain SUPER-GREAT, EVERYTHING about it. The actors, plot, the directing, it has the right amount of all things.  Keeps you wanting to rush home to see the next one, even though I don't like to wait till the next week or season, it has me on pins and needles..
B00AHXIC50|5.0|So I had to check on it. You know, only seven months after the album dropped and after numerous songs hit the radio. I happen to love the singles and the rest of the tracks. For a 10-song album, I feel like I can listen to it over and over again without annoying myself. That's awesome.
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|I am interested in watching it but I won't say, I rush home to in order to tune in. I do like the &#34;detective work&#34; that is in it. But not what I anticipated Sherlock to be like.
B0081L391C|5.0|This movie is funny as hell I wasn't sure of buying it but I'm glad I did cuz this movie is awesome and super funny
B004T0E2S8|1.0|It closes every time I search for a song on my Acer Tablet. There are sevens more words to write.
B003477DVK|5.0|Adorable, heart warming movie for the soul. Brings back good memories : ) loved it, wish there were more out there like this.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I found the book very helpful, if not a little alarming, because I was able to see myself and the mistakes I was making.  That's half the battle to correcting any issue.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe I read this book in a day!! Need the next one now!!! Such an outstanding book!! Loved it!!!!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I never heard of James Altucher until I attended an event in NYC called Social Triggers Live. James is hysterical and his talk was both entertaining and educational. This is not an easy feat and many speakers miss the mark. After getting back home I got this book and why wouldn't I? He's offering to reimburse you for reading the book! But that's not why I recommend it. In fact, this is my first book review ever on Amazon or any other site. I recommend it because it spoke to me in a way that no other book has before. I've always suffered from \\"best little boy in the world\\" syndrome and I couldn't imagine putting myself first. What I truly love about this book is that it's not about stepping on others to put yourself first. It's about choosing yourself and giving others the permission to choose themselves first too. Wow! What a concept. You can get a head, take care of yourself and help others all by choosing yourself.<br /><br />This book has had such a profound impact that I contacted James and asked him if I could reprint a portion of his book in my magazine Pharmacy Marketing Quarterly. I wanted to share this message with my audience and I wanted to do something for James to help him get his message out and you know what he said? \\"Yes, sounds perfect to me. Thanks Scot!\\" It'll be reprinted in our August issue.<br />You owe it to yourself to read this book. And if you know someone that hasn't found their \\"purpose\\" get them a copy too. My only complaint is that I wish James had written this book 10 years ago. Get this book. Choose yourself.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This was my first experience reading a book by Zafon. I found it a true delight. I was kept guessing until the very end!
B000FC146C|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, I remember my mom watching the mini series as a kid but, I was too young to remember it. The book was fantastic! Perfect book for summertime!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app.. it has so much too like and what's not to love about MINIONS... fun and thrills for the whole family.
B00C50NV2M|5.0|These are some very light 3d glasses, and that means a lot to me. Everyone that has put them on says that they though it was going to be an ordeal to wear glasses to watch 3d, but they agree that they are very light.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this app with money I mean its worth it people<br />you really should get this for kids or for you.<br />I mean...I built the titanic! on my minecraft pe!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Very fun and entertaining game..... I was so dissapointed when I bet it after level 60.  Please add more levels plarix..... I am addicted.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It may be a little small, however, when waiting in line or for a movie to start I can always continue to read my books.  I always have my smartphone with me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love despicable me, this is a great free game that has obstacles that mimic temple run. Very fun to play
B00CEJ2ATO|5.0|Most people compare this album to Risk, but this album is far from it. It's much more hard rock than Thrash metal. There are also a good number of songs on it, such as: Kingmaker, Cold Sweat (Thin Lizzy cover), Dancing in the Rain, and many more!
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Just started playing it and I'm hooked! Great way to waste away time,lol. I have been looking for something like this for a while and I'm glad I found it.
B005SS2QXS|5.0|This case offers a great protection for my iphone, you can leave your phone facing down and the screen does not get scratches.
0399215921|5.0|I love eric carle books.. this is one of my favorites. I love how the pages (at least in the hardcover book) are embossed so you can actually feel the spiderweb as the spider works on it throughout the book. The illustrations are cool and the story is cute. We are so happy to add it to our eric carle collection!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game and the world tour that they at first but now y'all have it this mega awesome
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband and I aren't really board game people, but we have to admit this game is so much fun, we played it with my brother in law and ended up buying it for ourselves. It's competitive and requires some strategy. Great for 2 to 4 players.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Took me just a little while to figure out how scoring worked, but it is really fun and challenging.  Would recommend.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I make many references to it in teaching freshmen and have noticed that many of our families have the movie at home and have watched it together.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|I think The Blind Side is a great movie!  I really enjoyed Sandra Bullock in this movie!  It's a good movie to inspired someone or just show what some compassion for a fellow human and can do and mean!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Wow wee this 3rd installment of the crossfire series is not about to disappoint. Gideon are Eva are loved up totally in this book. Their demons are finally getting out into the open. Sofar l'm 50% into it and l'm rifling through it. I think and l stand corrected this book is far and away better than the first two. But see for yourself. A must if your into a good bit of hot passionate graphic sex. Gideon is a sex god.
B0084IT59C|5.0|It's a story of absurd people in absurd situations. The characters are ridiculous, but believably so- the sort of crazy, damaged people that the world is full of. The main character's tale is like a long, slow motion car crash that you can't look away from. A spectacle worth seeing, in other words.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome and fun.My brother loves it. It  is a fun  distraction if I need to do something away from my children.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I love Khaled's books and I find the characters so strong. I admire the women from those countries so much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most fun game that deals with running.  If you like this game you will like Temple Run 1&2 and Disney brave run an the great powerful oz. They are very fun in my experience with these types of running games.thank you for reading this.
B005544V6A|5.0|Right up their ally, I'm so glad to find a show that steps in when white collar and psych are in their off season!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I will admit, I was a little disappointed wIth this book. I feel the first 2 were much better... can't really say what I did & didn't love. No worries though, I am looking forward to reading the 4th!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I was so attached to some of the characters, not the ending I was hoping for but looking forward to the new season
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Easy to read, written surprisingly well, recommend for an easy day at bus, plane, sub, or home reading, 5 stars!
B00DM0UTPQ|1.0|The movie consists of well known actors, however, they are speaking english the entire movie with no russian accent. I would not recommend this film to anyone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't stress how much I enjoyed reading this book. I would read some parts really fast just to see what happened and then reread very slowly just to make sure I read it right.  I have the kindle app on my iPhone and iPad and the \\"x-ray\\" button is so helpful. It tells you about the characters on the page you are reading so you can keep track of who is who.  Amazing!!
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I bought the blu-ray because Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor and after watching the first 10mins of episode 1 I was hooked. I finished the entire season in less then a week which normally would take me nearly a month even for my favorite shows like Breakin' Bad & The Walking Dead. Can't wait till the 2nd season is released.<br /><br />My only complaint is the packaging is terrible. It should be more like a diga pack and not what it really is. The discs are very difficult at times to get out and worries me of potential scratches. Hopefully season 2 will have better packaging.
B009RRIP86|5.0|Honestly I have never seen, or owned a case this nice in my life. Everything on it works great and it looks amazing sitting on my desk. The only small difficult thing about it was getting some of the power cables over to the motherboard because it is a tight fit for the power cables. The case is solidly built (there was one small piece of plastic that was broken off but it isn't critical and also a rubber piece was unstuck but I just stuck it back on and there was moisture on the packaging) and works great. I give it 5 stars even though there was packing issues and shipping issues because I am rating the case not the shipping. I am perfectly happy with this case and will use it for years to come.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Can wait for the next one.  Good prequil to the Lord of the Rings.  Plan to purchase all of the movies and save for grandchildren
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, it was challenging yet not impossible to figure out with a little work! The negative for me was only having ten levels; I feel like I was just getting started and into it, and then it was over! Great workout for your brain!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Glad I didn't purchase an $8 ticket to the movies to see this.  I was disappointed with the whole thing
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the first book that I have felt passionate enough about to leave a review.  I loved everything about the book from the first page!  Thank you for a completely different take on a romance novel!
B00116FT6M|4.0|A fun musical.  It brought back memories of American Band Stand in the 50's and 60's.  I would recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I get better weather reports from our local TV station. I'm not really that interested in weather around the world.
B005U9REU0|1.0|\\"The Spectacle of Bowie's Crotch,\\" because my God does that take up a lot of the focus when it's prancing around on screen.  I heard that it actually received it's own billing, and that it had it's own trailer and wardrobe and make-up people.  And that it was a total diva and kept demanding more screen time.  I'm fairly certain it even sings a song or two,  but they left those out and we'll have to wait for the Director's Crotch, I mean Director's Cut for that.  If you enjoy crotches, and more specifically Bowie's crotch, than this movie will have you begging for more.  If, however, you're only lukewarm on crotches, or think Bowie's crotch could use a bit more work on its acting, then this is one crotch you probably want to avoid.  Inside information: I hear that they're thinking of remaking this with Justin Timberlake's crotch, but that the darned thing is already asking for too much money.  Greedy crotches.
015206396X|5.0|A captivating start to a terrific series. I recommend all the books, each perfect in its way. In this book, Cashore shows her chops at articulating a smooth character arc for the hero(ine). The unfolding of Katsa's love for Po is pure delight, its pacing perfect. Indeed, it's handled with true Grace.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The escape room game keeps your eyes moving and brain rolling. The numbers and color combination is great for the brain.
B005544V6A|5.0|We have become huge fans and are frantically trying to catch up on the first 2 seasons before the premier of season 3 next week. Great story lines and lot's of office intirgue, keeps us coming back for more!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app its the only thing that will wake me up....i can set it to play otep to wake me up and to not stop playing the song intill i answer math questions....it saves me alot of time and i use it everyday..best thing ive downloaded yet!!!
B004R63MWQ|2.0|The movie focused completely on showy futuristic technology effects and completely ignored any effort in the writing and acting department. Oh well!! Still found it slightly entertaining; I'm easy to please.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|If I Stay is one of those books I picked up a year after it came out. I really wished I'd picked it up with the original hardcover gorgeousness, but alas my copy is a paperback. IF I STAY is a beautiful, well written, lyrical novel. Mia, her family and friends and Adam (oh Adam!!!) feel very very real to me. The incorporation of flashbacks were done extremely well here and it was easy to see which ones were present tense and which were a memory of Mia's. What I LOVE about this book is that the ending was a freaking STAND A LONE. You don't need to read the second book! Mia's story feels complete and wonderful during this book. Recommended for fans of writing like Lauren Oliver's (Before I Fall) and gorgeous storytelling.
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, the score, the plot, it just may be the perfect movie. The blu-ray quality looks great and brings new life to a film I used to enjoy on VHS.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Its really sarcastic and not exactly romantic. It's more of a movie for individuals than a group of friends. It was really funny but kind of sad.
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|I hooked this up to a Yamaha RX-V475 and was playing music from a iPhone 5 (Pandora, Pandora downloader, and youtube) in a few minutes. Very Easy. Range worked from every room. After making the 2 connections on the back of the receiver (USB DC OUT) and (AV2 Which is the size of a single RCA jack) I turned on the receiver and turned on my iPhone 5's Bluetooth. All phones find it within seconds and simply tap the YBA-11 and it connects! Didn't even need to enter the passcode which is \\"0000\\". EDIT: The button on the bluetooth reciever drops whoever is currently connected. Otherwise no need to push the button. Since I don't use iTunes I prefer this method over having to use the network adapter and playing music on a computer which has to be on, or an iPod/iPhone and through iTunes. I do however have 1 song on my phone's iTunes and it played great. I don't have any android devices but it should hook up just as easily. Love this thing!
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|I may be biased because I'm n love with Joseph Gordon-Levitt but this movie will have you laughing, and smiling. It's kind of a puppy love type movie. I believe it's equally made for men and woman but mostly for ypung adults. Its not exactly the best movie if you have little kids around but a cute couple movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|:) I like this game.  some levels. are more challenging then others but enjoyable. my 9 year old daughter really likes this game as well
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was very good. I enjoy how the author writes about the stories of old mythology, it's creatures and the tasks of the gods.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|it's so-so and i like the story and they picked the right cast but the ending is kind of sad but it's cool takes a while too get good but it's okay
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Amusing and entertaining.  Better than I expected based on the little write up you can read on line at amazon .
B009AVC922|5.0|saw this movie a long, long time ago and so did my cousin and i bought this for him and he'll love it. makes you jump up in your set and cheer and cry and the same time, trustb me it's worth buying!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Hilarious and informative book by Tina Fey - a sort of autobiography.  The Mom, Dad, and teen daughter in this family all loved it.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|this movie kicks ass and so much i bought it for my cousin who watched it with me and the characters and the story is great  and it's worth it to me.  it kept me watching it over and over.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful continuing journey.  I am not watching it,  I feel a part of the story.<br />Cannot wait for the next season!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever!!! great for any age. I love this game it is awesome I am a big despicable me fan.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I bought this movie, without seeing it at the theatre. Very good movie, plenty of action scenes, overall a well, scripted movie with a lot of great actors and actresses. I recommend this movie to all of my friends.
1608955702|5.0|This is an excellent book for any photographer who wants to progress their photographic journey beyond gear collecting. Lots of great advice to help you see the light and change it when needed. Neil's writing style is fresh and easy to read.<br /><br />Recommended
B003G4W49C|3.0|Overall I'd say it was pretty good. It was a bit slow at times and other times it seemed hard to follow but I think it's worth your time especially if you like sci-fi.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thick ist really cool for ages<br />And I love the game<br />Gangland mm Inc's first pitch to eat lunch ball to eat lunch later on minecarft ed hardy the boss of mini zombies in the boss of mini
B004SIIBGU|1.0|It's not user friendly. It's far too much work to find everything I want to like on Ebay com. I have had repetitive problems logging it at times. It seems it doesn’t want to recognize my password until 4-5 attempts. If I go online to Ebay com there is not any password issues so it is the app with the issue. The quick &#34;overview&#34; is useless if your selling and want to check complete info on your item like watchers etc. Difficult to switch from your item back to auction list. Not impressed at all. I deleted it and will stick to my laptop for ebay. Then again its free so....( you get what you pay for ) LOL
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I got the game hoping it would be scary and I was right. My friend played this and no kidding he pissed his pants. The audio really adds to the feeling.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|LITTLE PURPOSE.  NOT WELL DEFINED STORY.  VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOOW.  THIS MOVIE WOULD MAKE A GREAD SEDATIVE.  I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE TOM HANKS IN THIS TYPE OF ROLE.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love the variety of sounds, the ability to combine sounds, the ability to control volume of sounds individually and I can close cover and continues to play and does not use much battery life.
B00BZW5W3W|3.0|I'm a big Maysa fan, so I keep waiting for her to have that knockout hit with that amazing voice of hers; however, this one did not do the trick for me.  Writing was weak and elementary.  Wish she'd do some original works to showcase her great voice.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett scores again with a captivating story of life, love, hardship and politics set against one of the most fascinating periods in history. Juxtaposing the class struggles of several cultures with the sweeping political upheaval of the 20th century Ken Follett draws you in and keeps you reading for hours. Can't wait to start the second book.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Funny and fun dairy<br />of a wimpy kid who has a dog who is a mess a lot more then him.
B00946WMXY|5.0|Though only 1 hr and 47 minutes lone and the shortest and grittiest and least attractive of the Bond films, I think this was probably the one that I have watched more than the rest of them.  I love the grit, the dirt, the ugly surroundings, the asexual relationship between Olga Kurylenko and Daniel Craig who each has their own agenda and can well handle their situation alone, if necessary.  This is the first time that Bond doesn't get to sleep with beautiful lead.  Have you ever noticed how many of the Bond girls get bumped off right after sleeping with him?  Let's face it, the guy Bond is after isn't the worst villain in a Bond film and comes to an ironic end, but the villain Kurylenko is after is one of the nastiest, genocidal maniac in charge that has been in a Bond film.  Of course he is only in the film towards the end, however, Kurylenko's back story is more heartbreaking than Bond's.  This film is more Noir than the rest and the beginning action sequence in the midst of a construction site is actually kind of mind blowing for a film that forgoes all of the chases and fights that are in most Bond films.  I left the film satisfied and felt that all my questions were answered.  Usually I don't feel that way about a Bond film.  I had to watch \\"Skyfall\\" which is excellent several times before I got it.  The beautiful Bond girl in this film comes to an end all to suddenly and I keep asking myself, why does the villain kill her?  It just didn't make sense.  Finally, I realize, that it was because the villain cannot accept failure of any kind, even when someone has performed credibly and brought about a successful conclusion to an operation.
B003U53GK8|5.0|I was a LOST groupie from the first episode on TV. Really enjoyed watching all 6 seasons again, because I had a clearer understanding of where it was headed, and I got to see the rare episode I missed. It was good to see the eye candy boys again too-- Sawyer, Sahid and Jack!!
B004GE15MI|5.0|I just watched this film for about the one zillionth time and fell in love with Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney all over again.  This is the best film about the ups and downs of a marriage.  It has the best musical score by Henry Mancini.  In fact it is probably one of the best of Stanley Donen's non-musicals.  Also, it's a travelogue like you have never seen.  Did I forget to mention that besides being funny, sad and totally wonderful, Jacqueline Bissett makes probably one of her first film appearances in this film.  When you talk about beauty, Jackie had it in 1967 and still retains it in her 60's.

0618526412|5.0|The first sentence drew me in, and by the time I'd read the third one, I was captivated. The sight of the two mutes walking down the street towards their jobs let the reader know that some interesting stories were about to unfold, not just about Singer and his friend but about several individuals in the neighborhood. Plus, the reader somehow senses that although the mutes might have been the first people mentioned, the novel has a universal appeal to all folks.<br /><br />I can't decide whether The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a coming of age story for Mick, a tale of many lives intersecting in a neighborhood where the characters are oppressed in some way or another, or a treatise on social injustice disguised as a novel. What I do know is that the characters are richly developed, the scenes are described in vivid detail (including the smells and sounds), and the social climate of the era is described right along with the plot(s).<br /><br />While people like Singer, Mick, Portia, Dr. Copeland, Jake, and Biff were fictitious characters living hardscrabble lives \\"back in the day,\\" they might just as well be living today. There is still social inequality, injustice, and poverty. There is still loneliness and heartache. There are those who have \\"inside\\" rooms just like Mick, rooms where they can dream and imagine as they live their day-to-day lives. And like her, they sit in diners wondering about the trajectory of their future lives.<br /><br />While this isn't a happy book, it's one that makes the reader think. About halfway through, I learned that Carson McCullers was only 23 years old when she published The Heart. I was amazed that someone so young could have so much insight into the human psyche, understanding of relationships, and knowledge of social injustice. Truly, a great read!
B002BVQU5A|4.0|Johnny Dell's brilliant slapstick comedic timing (including amazing imitations of Buster Keton routines) shines in this quirky, lovable portrayal of Sam, the perfect counterpoint for Masterson's multi-faceted Joon, who is mentally disturbed but bright and articulate, artistically bold yet fearful of the world beyond her safe home...rational, then uncontrollably psychotic....can this star-struck pair find happiness? Quinn's Benny has insulated Joon from the world at the sacrifice of his personal happiness, and is desperately seeking the best situation for Joon, and is sure Sam is not it!  Wonderful, rich performances from all, including a string suppirting cast...20+ years later it is still a great movie! Lovrd seeing Depp making grilled cheese with an iron!
1885167776|5.0|Most self-help/self-improvement books focus either on the big picture - what I would call attitude/belief/mindset or they focus on very specific tactics.  Examples of big picture books would be As a Man Thinketh by James Allen or A Manual for Living - Epictetus.  On the other extreme are books like Getting Things Done by David Allen. It is my fundamental belief that you need to incorporate both in order to have a successful life.  That is, if you change your beliefs without taking action on the changes you have not accomplished anything.  The ONE Thing is a remarkable book in that it incorporates both big picture thinking and specific actions.  The truly unique approach Gary Keller takes in The ONE Thing is to simplify the action down to one thing - something that is simple, easy and can have a huge impact on your life.  If you simply apply the big picture thinking and the small step tactics he outlines, you will dramatically improve your results.<br /><br />This is certainly the best book in the self-help, self-improvement genre that I have read in the last couple of years.  It may be the best combination of big picture thinking /specific tactics that I have read.  That is quite a statement since I have read hundreds of books in this category.<br /><br />The book is a result of deep introspection by Gary Keller.  He is a student of human behavior and has done extensive study and research into what makes some people very successful while others who may in fact work harder do not seem to enjoy the same level of success.  This book is a synthesis of all he has learned about what it takes to be successful in work and in life.<br /><br />Here is an example of the lessons he has learned and truly the heart of the book.  \\"Where I'd had huge success, I had narrowed my concentration to one item, and where my success varied, my focus had too.\\"  The central message, repeated throughout the book is to focus on the one thing that you can do today that will make a real difference in your life.  He suggest that you get rid of your to-do list and replace it with a success list.<br /><br />There are some very powerful concepts - big picture lessons in the book.  \\"Purpose without priority is powerless.\\"  We need to have a clear sense of purpose.  \\"Purpose has the power to shape our lives only in direct proportion to the power of the priority we connect it to.\\"  We must have purpose and a sense of priority.  He gives some background on the origin of the word priority and how we have diluted its meaning by so often using the plural \\"priorities\\".  We need one priority - The ONE Thing.<br /><br />Mr. Keller combined with his co-author Jay Papasan are excellent writers.  The book is a very fast and enjoyable read.  The concepts are straightforward and easy to understand.  Where appropriate there are some nice visual representations.  There is one very neat printing technique they employ - that is to underline certain sentences. The underline is in a \\"handwriting\\" font, so it looks like it was done manually.  One of the things I do when reading a book is to underline important concepts/ideas.  I still found plenty to underline.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter is a recap of the \\"Big Ideas\\" in that chapter.  This makes it very easy to go back and revisit the important points without having to re-read the entire chapter.<br /><br />There is also a companion website [...] that offers additional resources.<br /><br />If you are truly serious about improving your results, this is a great how-to guide.  Like any good book, the value you gain will be in implementing the ideas presented in this book.  As Mr. Keller points out many times in the book, none of us have the willpower necessary to always to what we should.  You will need to repeat the small steps until they become habits.  Then the magic happens.<br /><br />I was provided a review copy of this book.e in your life.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|What a great movie. If you are an Anglophile this is THE movie to have. Maggie Smith is wonderful but I think Billy Connolly steals the show.  I give it an 11 out of 10.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|To travel back to a more &#34;civilized&#34; time is wonderful...the costumes and automobiles, the strict rules of the aristocracy...all the house is a family...I will watch this show over and over!

B00101ZOTA|5.0|Smart, clever, and just really good.  The writer of this movie is a genius.  Spacey was so convincing.  I loved the acting.
0449208109|1.0|The pages are very yellow and falling apart, there is writing on about 50% of the pages with hearts drawn everywhere.  This is the first time I have had any issue with a used book.  This should not have been sold, it should have been donated.
B00BB8VRPM|3.0|Honestly, I wanted to love this film. A friend recommended this as her favorite.  The first half was rather sappy, and I wondered if I had selected the wrong movie.  It was hard for me to believe that this melancholy woman would fall for a man that acted so silly. When he is taken away, the man makes a game of the horrible circumstances for the benefit of their son.  It was inconceivable that anyone could maintain his demeanor under such grim conditions.  Even though they were in a concentration camp, the movie didn't dwell on the negative (altho that is the reality).  I rated this movie as okay as the underlying message was to see the &#34;silver lining&#34; in any situation -- which is a good theme in life for anyone.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a good ending to a mediocre series. I don't always appreciate how the author spends so much time on certain details, and then sprints through other segments, especially in the action moments. But it keeps the book moving.
B0031RG846|5.0|Just wrote this for another review of a Schleich animal (a tiger cub). Instead of re-inventing the wheel, here's what I wrote:<br /><br />Schleich makes quality products. My girls have several Schleich toy animals ranging from domestic dogs to polar bears, and they love them and play with them all the time. What more can I say? When I was a kid, I would have loved to have animals made at this price point with such attention to detail. Well done, solid toys.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|Having been majorly impressed by the 2009 reboot of Star Trek, naturally I was excited about seeing \\"Star Trek - Into Darkness\\".  I enjoyed it and like that J.J. Abrams is keeping to the original Star Trek's roots via great casting and playing with previous story lines (Admiral Christopher Pike, Khan, the elder Spock, etc.) due to the `time rift' in the 2009 remake.<br /><br />The reason for 3 stars instead of 5 for \\"Into Darkness\\" is due to the lack of emotion and depth coming from the cast in this one.  Something was off or missing in their performances that was there wholeheartedly in the 2009 reboot.  I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatch and perceive him as a top notch actor; however his Khan portrayal was nowhere near as good as the original by Ricardo Montalban.  Nor was there much depth in what should have been an extremely emotional scene between Kirk and Spock when their roles were switched and Kirk was dying.  In the \\"Wrath of Khan\\" that scene was fantastic and drenched with so much emotion and sadness that you could drown in a pool of your own tears (go back and watch it if you don't believe me)!  In this one, I didn't care much whether Kirk died or not - lol - and as a Star Trek fan, that is tragic.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Star Trek - Into Darkness\\" and if I get the chance, I may go see it again or rent it when it comes out simply because I love everything about Star Trek.  That said, it seemed like the cast just showed up, read their lines then went home which is a far cry from what they did in the first one.<br /><br />To the new Star Trek cast & crew:  You have very big shoes to fill... half-hearted acting is not going to cut it!
B005DJREJS|3.0|Starts strong, but never lives up to the first episode.  Main character begins to sound whiny and needy by the end of the season.
B0081336FO|5.0|A more modern take on the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  The characters are updated in a way that makes them very believable and the stories keep a solid, quick pace so it is hard to get bored.  The show is quite funny, and will appeal to anyone with a dry and/or dark sense of humor.  Season Two literally picks up at the moment season one left off (like the Karate Kid: Part II).  Just like season one, the sound editing is wacky...the music blares at ridiculous volume compared to the dialogue, which seems to be a trend with new movies/shows.  (The sound issue is a personal pet peeve, but I know it annoyed the hell out of me so I figured I'd save a few people the headache of music blaring at them unexpectedly during intros or action sequences.)<br /><br />Great show.  Watch it.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Very talented people in this show. I love the theme of the show, I love the singing, Excellent casting of the characters. I have been watching it on TV, but when I started watching it on the Kindle, there were several episodes that I had missed. Thanks for having it on prime.

B00DGNOMB6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The music and vocals were great.  The cast chosen was excellent.  Persons past middle age would enjoy this movie.  This is about misunderstandings and relationships.  Usually movies concentrate on younger people, this is a love story for mature adults.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great fun to watch, Was recommended by Grandson and we enjoyed it. Would recommend this film for both adult and children.
B007TUAHVQ|4.0|My guy loved it so much that he took it apart and mixed the pieces up with all his other Lego and Mega Bloks so we can never put it back together again. It was good while it lasted (Two days after his Birthday).

B000P0J0AQ|1.0|Never understood the appeal of this flick. It just seems like a movie with zero substance hidden behind a bunch of special effects. David Lynch's movies are confusing, but, at least they're not boring. IMO, the Matrix was a snooze-fest.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|Best movie ever!<br />the casing is great<br />the art work on the disc that a 5 thumbs up<br />but the movie is just stunning never seen something so cool Wow I enjoy this movie very much!
B00005JKJA|3.0|Leave it to David Lynch to create such a thoroughly confusing flick. Although I dug the sex scenes and Mr Jennifer Aniston Justin Theroux getting punched out by Billy Ray Cyrus. Also, this was way less confusing than the last David Lynch movie i watched, Lost Highway.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|It's light funny and fun to watch for all age groups.  Barbara Eden really lives the role and the rest of the cast is great.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have loved the mystery about this book (among other things!) but I did not like how the book ended.  Nor did I like the fact there has been notice about when the conclusion will come out.  This was not a way to end the book.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Every page is readable and you can not put it down.  Can't wait for no. 4 to solve the mystery
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show, hope more people watch it so it won't go away, like Firefly did. Seems network tv just wants to show us Reality TV, and I'm sick of it and CSI shows.
B009WUBERW|4.0|There is lots of action in this movie, but movie showed way too much blood and gore for my taste.  I prefer when the movie makers leave the blood and guts more to my imagination.  The streaming quit once, but other than that it was an enjoyable experience.  One thing I don't understand is why Amazon has Expendables 2 on Amazon Prime free rental, but not the first movie of the same name.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Videos news maps email couldn't find the weather!  Not intuitive and if I want news videos I will watch TV.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|It seems pretty sturdy but time will tell.  I guess it is my fault for not pulling out a ruler and measuring on my wrist but it is definitely a borderline women's sized watch.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Useful for a time but an update or program glitch caused it to cease working. When it did work it would place an ad over the update data button while giving you yesterdays weather. Uninstalled it as it is not worth the trouble to fix it, if it can be fixed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and enticing game. look foreward to more like it. passes the time well. challenging but not overly so. addicting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very good, fast read.  Keeps your interest throughout - the type of book you don't want to put down.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Intriguing enough to keep my interest.  I like this game and will continue playing it.  Thank you for creating it and for making it FREE.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|WOW, WOW, WOW!! This has to be one of the best in the series! What an emotionally, heartbreaking story for Kaleb and Sahara. The hell Kaleb endured at the hands of Santano just to keep Sahara safe, even though he had no idea if she was dead or alive and for 7 years thinking he had done her harm. And the hell Sahara endured in the hands of two of the highest of the council, but always keeping Kaleb close, with the bracelet and charms he gave her, even though she had shut her mind down. This paranormal series is not only highly intelligent and scientific at times but Nalini just knows when to weave in the romance so we can swoon. Love her and absolutely love this series!!!!
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|The game kept turning upside down.  Each scene was a different direction.  Took it off and downloaded again still doing it.  This time I will leave it off.  I cannot play it.

B00ADQCBEY|4.0|This show hooked me in, even if it was quite a bit more violent then I'm used to....Michael Chiklis' Vic left me questioning is he a good guy? or is he a bad guy? in every episode! Not the kind of show with a clear black and white storyline.... good show...
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Downton Abbeyeque.  Better than the earlier version of the same series in black and white and broken up into half hour shows. It's a good production, better acting, sets, costuming.

B00CTXBO9M|5.0|If you want a simple, fun, action game, just something to distract you from your day, this is it!  Doodle jumps, boucing on the solid steps, some of them moving, following the path you select by tilting your tablet to the right or left.  He gets boosts from coiled springs strategically placed along the upward route, as well as a beanie-copter, trampolines, and jet packs.  Broken steps fail under the bounces, and dangers loom present at many levels.  You can shoot them (directional shooting helps) by tapping the screen, but don't misstep while shooting or you will fall all the way back to the ground.

B008XKT9FG|5.0|This movie was full of surprises...it made you feel good too.  Which is one reason I watch movies today.  If I wanted reality I would turn on the news.  The actors were good too and so many.  Don't know why I didn't hear about this when it first came out.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Movie is well done. Even if you don't like Ben Affleck, this is worth seeing. He acts like a grown up in this one.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great game, this is my first time playing Magic in a decade and it was very easy to pick up. I only wish there was online multiplayer.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Mr Connelly has another hit with detective Bosch.  Great story line, suspenseful, hard to put it down once I start reading.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch for my husband, and he is very picky about watches. He does not like wearing any type of jewelry, and previous watches i have bough him as gifts, he simply never wore. However he seems to really like the simple design and the fact that it is a smaller size watch face. This is an excellent watch, and while there are probably better out there, for the price i would definitely purchase this one again.
0446573027|3.0|This is my first David Baldacci novel, so I have no basis for comparison, but I'm inclined to changed that because I liked the writing style. I'd rate the book no more than 3.5 stars overall for two primary reasons; the characters and the plot. On the one hand I enjoyed the story a great deal. It kept me interested and I found myself reading it more than I usually allot per day for a book. On the other hand there were a number of pieces that didn't really click with me, starting with the lead role.<br /><br />I've read several reviews that compare John Puller with Lee Child's prime character Jack Reacher. Since I haven't read any Child books yet the only thing I'll say about that is if Puller and Reacher have more in common than their size and branch of service then I may not read any Reacher novels because Puller has no personality. I'm not saying it's strange for a career soldier, from a family of military men, to behave the way Puller does in this book, it's just not very compelling reading. I found myself becoming more interested in the other characters, such as the Cole family, than the protagonist because he just isn't very believable, on multiple levels. For one thing he approached every interview/interrogation with an antagonistic attitude. Any decent investigator knows to treat every encounter differently, and attitude plays a large role in the quality of information collected, so it's no surprise that Puller had to question almost everybody more than once to get what he needed from them.<br /><br />Then there's the main plot of the story, which while entertaining for the most part was one contrived point after another, with some it bordering on science fiction. An Army colonel and his family is murdered in rural West Virginia and they send only one person to investigate? There's a nuclear threat in that same area, something even Puller isn't trained for, and the government does nothing?? This reasoning is explained but it still makes no sense. They don't want to 'send in the big guns' because it might scare off some potentially high-interest suspects, but it's just as suspicious to not at least send a forensic team to help. There's too much pseudo-drama brought on by Puller being an army of one, as it were, that could've been more realistic had the Army done SOMETHING, which may have allowed the characters to develop more. I don't want to give too much away but there's no way that bomb, which was clearly a 'fizzle', would do more than crack that concrete dome with an incapacitated core.<br /><br />There were also several little things regarding the military, technology, and government in general that wasn't very accurate. I realize this is a work of fiction, so I do expect some inconsistencies, but having been part of both military and law-enforcement those things tends to stand out to me. One particular point is that Baldacci doesn't seem to know what DHS does. He writes them as if they're a single agency instead of a department of agencies, likely only to support his clich&eacute;d conclusion. If the FBI were involved in a case would you refer to them as Dept. of Justice? I'm not going to list all of the agencies in DHS but quite frankly none of them would have any direct involvement in this story beyond disseminating information. Also, nightvision amplifies ambient light, so if there is none they don't work. There's certainly more but again, these are very minor, and doesn't effect the story much, but these little things do add up.<br /><br />Having said all that, I genuinely did enjoy the read, and think others less critical than I am could enjoy it even more. If you're a fan of murder mysteries, the military, or the author I would recommend this book. Also, if you enjoy this type of main character you might want to check out CID Agent Paul Brenner, by Nelson DeMille. He is much more interesting and believable IMO, despite there being only two books featuring him so far.ant to 'send in the big guns' because it might scare off some potentially high-interest suspects, but it's just as suspicious to not at least send a forensic team to help.

B0015DWJX2|2.0|This book started slow for me. But when I got close to the middle I started to enjoy it and liked it.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|I felt the drama was weak.  Very predictable and dull.  Quartet is not original.  How About You was so much better.  Away From Her is a movie that actually deals with real issues of aging, but the majority of viewers couldn't stomach it.
1616550414|5.0|I got this as a gift for a Zelda fan who has played all the games and has loved all of them. He says it is fantastic to be able to refer to the book to learn more about all the races and characters in the Zelda universe.  Nothing else compares when you are looking for a physical copy of Zelda lore.
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked this movie. I thought it was well done and it kept my interest. I now understand what the tv series is about.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the movie, I decided to read the books.  I wasn't disappointed.  The book was thoroughly enjoyable and a very quick read as I found I had a difficult time putting it down. I highly recommend this book.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|I'm not sure if any special liberties were taken when transferring this film to BluRay but it looks and sounds excellent for a classic film. The extra detail provides a sort of hyper realism my old VHS tapes can't provide, which is very attractive to me as an enthusiast of vintage racing.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel is so moving. It evokes everyone one of your emotions. It is a read you cannot put down
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Don't buy this if you are offended bylanguage that is not poliitcally correct. by today's standards, but would be correct for the time period of the movie.
B008476HBM|4.0|Rereading this lovely novel gives a picture of what it was like for women in the olde days.  A little hard to relate to today, but some of the issues are still around!
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Jack Reacher in the book is 6&#34;'5&#34; and 250 pounds. Tom Criise is 5'7&#34;. The movie is O.K. , but the book is better, BUY THE BOOK!
0770437400|3.0|The description of this book as an oral history is true, but I guess I expected more from the book.  Parts of the book were interesting while I couldn't wait to finish this book just to be done reading it.  The movie brings it all to life and is much better.  Book from seller was in great condition and received in time promised.
B000001ESP|5.0|this is one of the popular cds they released back in the 90s.<br />the cd cost a mere pennies on the dollar on amazon.<br />check out the tracks/tom sawyer/xyz and more.<br />great music at low cost-shop amazon or other retail stores.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|There are some pretty funny parts, but the movie doesn't really go where you expect it to go.  Not bad, but glad that I didn't pay full price to see it in the theater.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The book started out decently enough, but soon changed. It didn't feel like she really stuck with the character story lines from previous books. The characters were lost, so to speak. It just seems like Charlaine Harris rushed the ending of the series and didn't really wrap the characters up!!  I've loved all of the other stories, but this one left me very disappointed and wanting a rewrite!!
B00881VLCE|1.0|Once you play it on your kindle, everytime you turn the kindle on the dumb annoying music from the app plays on it's own. You have to go into the app and re-exit it EVERY TIME you turn your kindle on.
B000000993|5.0|This album is one of my all time top five!!  It emerged when grunge ruled the scene. Thankfully, music like this kept people looking in dark corners for greater bands and even greater music.  This IS a must have album.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|What a weird and wonderful trip `The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada' is. Like most people I'm a James Bond fan and like some people I know Ian Fleming worked in naval intelligence. I didn't know the full extent to which he based 007 on his own life but from the research I've done since reading this book I can attest that the basic gist of this story and its presentation of the lead character is correct and accurate. Ian Fleming was indeed known as `17F,' he worked in Naval Intelligence, like Bond, and with the title Commander, like Bond. He was a bit of a bon vivante like Bond, relishing the best things in life. He was also a womanizer. In June 1940 he was dispatched by Admiral John Godfrey, a remote `M'-like person, to France to negotiate the purchase of Admiral Darlan's fleet. The German General in charge of the 9th Army was General Bock. Everything is accurate thus far. Reviews have pointed out the historical inaccuracies but I think they are taking this story too literally. I read this as a tongue-in-cheek homage to Bond with 90% of it being true and the rest being completely acceptable artistic license. The only fudging was killing off Darlan in 1940, when he died in 1942. Also, it's unlikely Fleming was that involved with the French resistance. HOWEVER, these little flights of fancy elevate this beyond what might have been a dry war story. The action sequences and the romance make the story sizzle. It's a bit slow to start but after the incredible parachute jump the action never really lets up to the end. The final moment between Fleming and Denise is a nice twist. There's a lot here to like and a ton of fascinating detail. Stevenson is a bit of a stylist and tends to ignore the rule `Never use a ten dollar word when a ten cents one will do' but if you like a book that relishes in language and historical minutiae and especially if you are a big Bond fan then you absolutely should read this book which is quite a steal at 99c
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a fun game for everyone to enjoy.  The graphics are cool and it goes quick.  Just match three and watch the fairies built. :)  love it
B00CEF014E|5.0|This book was almost impossible to put down. I found myself getting anxious as the percentage meter increased on my Kindle and the end approached because I did not want it to end. I really hope this is a series because this was one of the best horror suspense e-books I have read. It should be longer! But then again everything is as long as it should be and I had a great evening and a half losing myself in this remarkable, original and incredibly intense novella.
B008Y768XO|3.0|I found this movie quite mediochre and a little boring., I didn't finish watching it. The dog was cute though.
B003YCI1PM|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD. My friend ordered it off my wish list and I like it a lot. All of her music is happy and peppy and puts me in a dancing mood. I highly recommend if you like upbeat poppy music.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|I was surprised to see how well they enhanced certain scenes for 3D. It makes watching this movie over again fun! There are a few scenes that appear dark or grainy with 3D glasses on, but a good experience if your a fan of the movie.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Having read this series since inception, I often found the Psy focused novels less fulfilling to the point where I would skip portions of books when they talked about Psy, NetMind, DarkMind, etc...but this blows all that all out of the water.<br /><br />Other reviews do a good job of recapping, so I will skip it. What is so compelling about this book is the constant juxtaposition...of falling into the darkness and trying for the light, If loyalty is possible, is love for one with no emotion, is truth what is wanted if it means having a different perspective, can you be scarred and recover? I couldn't put this book down and stayed up waaayyyy past my bedtime to finish this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My little brother told me about the game and l was super excited to see it for kindle fire. Plus it's free. We are minion lovers!!!!!  It's so much fun with friends when using Facebook.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|This is the best app for drawing I have ever seen. It has a zoom function that is very helpful.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|This book was a great one,  will be useful for some of you quieter people out there.<br />It was interesting and also almost up to the mark. The book focuses less on what to say, and more on how to be prepared and wing it. It gives you ideas and thoughts on what you do to be social and how you do it.<br />When I read the book I took tons of great points but also, some points and ideas in the book were basic (only a few). It made me think about how I handle my friends and meeting new people , differently.<br />Great book overall and I enjoyed it. Hope you do too!<br />Review by.<br />Rohan Joseph<br />Age. 12
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I enjoyed this novel about a Harvard professor who suffers from early onset dementia who narrates her own story.  The point of view makes this an interesting look at a terrible disease.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|This short book can be read in a few hours, but it should be savored slowly so that the message is truly internalized.

B004SOR4H6|3.0|I like twitter but its to hard to understand, I still cant send twits yet plant I need twitting made simple
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I discovered the books a few months before the move came out, and neither disappointed.  They did a terrific job sticking to the story where they could, and if the plot, or any plot devices remind you of any more modern sci-fi adventures, you have to know that the books were written decades before the modern sci fi writers were born, so it is the original, and it deserves the chance to be seen and appreciated in all its glory.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is one of the most unique and fascinating TV shows I have ever seen.  I was very pleased to be able to view the episode that never aired and I'm glad I spent the $1.98 or whatever it was.  If you're a fan you should see this episode.
B000TDDIC0|5.0|What can you say its Bowie. Not a bad track on the album, more than you can say about a lot of the music coming out today where your lucky if you have two good songs among the entire cd.
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|I love the new sound . Jamie is alway a true artist of top quality. I am happy he is doing some new material and not relying on Standards like Michael Buble . The production on this CD is top notch with great sounds and Great voice. I would highly recommend this Download.

B004BJMEO6|3.0|Elena Undone (Nicole Conn, 2010)<br /><br />Elena Undone is known, mostly, for one thing--the kiss. The three minute and twenty-four-second kiss that broke the longest-onscreen-kiss record (three minutes and six seconds, You're in the Army Now, 1941). And let me rush to add before saying anything else that yeah, it is absolutely worth all the buzz. My oh my. But there's something I think it should be known for even more, and I was going to make it the subject of the opening paragraph (obviously), but then I realized it's kind of a spoiler, so I'll stick the plot synopsis on top of it and then, for those of you reading this in a place where it will have graphics, put up that big-[censored for Amazon consumption] \\"spoiler alert!\\" stop sign and you can figure out whether you want to continue reading. For the no-spoiler or short-attention-span crowds: I am recommending this, but with some reservations.<br /><br />Plot: Elena (Necar Zadegan, recently of Meth Head) is the wife of a pastor who's not quite sure what he believes--at the beginning of the film he seems to be a kind of laid-back guy, actually, but as one character wryly observes about halfway through the movie, psychotically-orthodox-religious Millie (Gone's Erin Carufel) is the church's biggest contributor, and so if Pastor Barry (Deadland's Gary Weeks) wants his church to stay afloat, he's got to adopt the same fire-and-brimstone attitude. Their marriage seems to be a solid one, though they have  the usual problems with a teenaged son, Nash (Connor Kramme, who seems to have hung up the acting gig to go behind the camera). And honestly, you can't call these folks a traditional family; Nash's girlfriend Tori (Beautiful Dreamer's Sabrina Fuster) lives with them; there are a couple of hints as to why this is, but it is never explicitly stated that I can remember. In any case, Elena and Barry have a friend from college named Tyler (Broadway actor Sam Harris, who won the very first season of Star Search back in the eighties), who dabbles in a little of everything to make money; one of the movie's conceits is that it cuts regularly to footage from a relationship video Tyler is editing (this starts off being kind of annoying, but by the end of the movie I was loving it). He also does psychic readings, and it is at one of Tyler's psychic-reading parties that Elena runs into Peyton (The Notebook's Traci Dinwiddie), an acquaintance Elena knows through the adoption agency where both of them have been feeling out the idea of adopting children--Elena because she and Barry may be having fertility problems, Peyton because she's a lesbian and isn't interested in going the \\"traditional\\" way when it comes to having a kid (she mentions early in the film she was previously married, and the expression on her face at the time should tell you all you need to know there). The two of them strike up a business relationship, but Elena quickly realizes that she has feelings geared toward turning it into something more...<br /><br />Okay, while the longest-onscreen-kiss thing is already kind of a spoiler, I'll stick up the spoiler alter stop sign here in case you don't want to know any more. Quit reading!<br /><br />[insert spoiler stop sign]<br /><br />But like I said, I think the movie deserves equally to be known for the orgasm. Why? Because I can't believe that Conn is unaware of Kirby [censored for Amazon consumption, and yes, I note the irony of having to censor the director's name...]'s fantastic documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated, one  sequence of which contains fairly damning evidence that one of the things the MPAA absolutely refuses to tolerate in a R-rated movie is the face of a woman having an orgasm. (It is the clips in that segment of the documentary that got the film rated NC-17, lending additional credence to this position.) And, well, let's say Traci Dinwiddie is either really good at faking, or that was really an orgasm. Needless to say, the movie was released unrated (it wasnever submitted for rating in the first place), and I can't help but see that scene as a poke in the eye to the MPAA. A much-deserved one, I might add. (The one country IMDB reports the film as being rated in is The Netherlands, and there it is considered suitable for those 12 years of age or older. That is extremely telling about the idiocy of American morality.)<br /><br />So okay, enough about sex. What about the rest of the movie? (Though honestly, the sex is probably enough for me to say \\"you should see this movie, it'll turn you on.\\") The actual plot of the film is kind of worn--a woman considers having an affair looking for something, and ends up finding herself--but it never actually feels that way, which is a big plus. On the other hand, some of the casting choices were questionable. There's a scene with Connor Kramme that's supposed to be intensely emotional that's, well, kind of unintentionally hilarious, and I really never bought Barry's transition from the confused-but-laid-back guy in the opening scenes to the fire-and-brimstone preacher; a bit more attention to that progression during the scriptwriting would have had a huge impact here, I think, and made Elena's ultimate decisions pack even more of a wallop than they did. (I will add that Sabrina Fuster's performance, which is sarcastic and knowing and all kinds of fun, does a lot to balance out these weak points--this is a woman with a very bright future in indie film, as long as Hollywood doesn't get hold of her.) So yeah, good points and bad points--but ultimately I think there's enough good here  to recommend it, even without the kiss or the orgasm. ***never submitted for rating in the first place), and I can't help but see that scene as a poke in the eye to the MPAA.

051756338X|3.0|I've read every one of Edward Rutherford's books, some several times.  This one was a disappointment.  I think what bothered me was the lack of continuity. It was like someone had dropped all the chapters and not bothered to put them back again.  I lost the feeling of history I usually get with his work, of following the families as they progress (or not) through the centuries.  This jumped around so much that I couldn't keep up with them, even with a scorecard in the frontispiece.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I was running out of time to find this for my vacation so I ordered it at the last minute from Amazon.  It arrived the day before I left just as they said it would.  It was a hard to find item around here so I was very pleased!

B002OR0RP0|5.0|I recently bought a 3D TV, and have tested it - the 3D is awesome. I therefore decided to watch a 3D streamed movie. On Amazon Prime, I looked specifically for 3D Movies, and this one showed up. There were even reviews about the great quality of the 3D in this movie. I rented this movie, but it seemed to be streamed in 2D only. The movie is excellent, which is why I gave it 5 stars. The quality of the 2D streaming was decent, and I would give Amazon Prime 4 stars, but I felt ripped off by Amazon Prime, because the movie was not in 3D. I think what causes the confusion is that Amazon may have combined the reviews of the 3D Blu-Ray of this movie, and of the streamed version of the movie. I feel Amazon Prime should not show this movie as one of the selections when you search for 3D movies - it is misleading.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Action packed, great story, good plot. An excellent modern day sci fi series. It is great watching it on Amazon without commercials.
B000002N3J|5.0|what a great music cd this is!. every song beautiful,there is no one like madonna,her voice is so strong and her songs make me feel so wonderful.I alllways love her music because I can sing along with her and my voice is alot like hers..buy this and enjoy it like I am
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Sometimes a book really makes you think, and I was happily surprised at this one. The way Brooks brings things full circle is amazing, and you don't even realize it until the end. (A great example is the decimations that lead to the priests handling the infected) well worth the time and effort to keep track of the characters, and the amazing descriptions.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I love Denzel!! This is a must have. Great movie. Keeps you on your toes the whole time! Did I say, great movie?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm glad I didn't let other's opinions influence me on if I should read the book or not.  I enjoyed it because while it was somewhat erotic, there was a good story line.  I think it dealt with real emotions and issues that happen in a relationship.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I have this game on my PC, my phone and my kindle.  Love it.  Our whole family plays KR.  And now we are into Frontiers.  Great follow up.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I rented this movie multiple times & finally decided to purchase it! It still makes me laugh! Fat Amy is my favorite!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The acting is superb, the movie is very interesting but only if you like history. It only focuses on the 13th Amendment so if you're looking for a Lincoln biography, this isn't it.
0684803356|3.0|I tried to get through it, I really did.  But then I remembered what a chore it was in High School when two of his novels were required reading.  It bored me stiff then, and it does now.  But I have found that with Hemingway, he's either your cup of tea, or he isn't.  The characters are shallow, and I don't like his writing style, in any of his stories.  Personal choice, to each his own.  As the reviews show, some love it, some don't.  I don't.  But at least I won't resort to name calling like some reviewers do, when someone doesn't share their opinion.  If you've never read it, give it a try, you may love it.  If you don't, its not indicative of your intelligence level as some would have us believe.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|PROOF OF HEAVEN WAS REALLY A BOOK FOR NON-BELIEVERS WHO HAVE A HIGH IQ.  IT SEEMS THE MORE INTELLIGENT, THE MORE DOUBT THAT THERE IS A LIVING GOD WHO HAS A SON WHO DIED FOR MANKIND SINS.  IT IS REALLY GREAT FOR THOSE WHO THINK OUT OF THE BOX AND WANT TRULY WANT TO FIND THE TRUTH IN ALL THINGS.  GREAT BOOK FOR PRISON MINISTRY.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|It was everything I like in a show, drama, music, dance, & great acting.  Debra Messing and Katherine McPhee were outstanding. I loved it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A fun interactive game that doesn't require in app purchases for you to progress. Only downfall is the ads after every activity. Both my son and daughter enjoy this game.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I never knew how much I would enjoy this, I am a captivated audience since the first story in this book.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Where is the search button? Popups come often warning do not download I mean it good.I'm telling you it is a virus
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the actors, love the storyline. Was upset with the cliffhanger and hope it doesn't end in tragedy.  Can't wait for season 4.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I was hoping for some deeper writing...the movie was a better story in my opinion.  Usually books are better, but this was not the case.
B001I10ABE|3.0|Metallica was great in the 80s but went downhill after the black album, still a good rock band but their thrashing days have come and went..<br /><br />The album itself is awesome but the sleeves and cardboard covers are crap... the sleeves suck! I had to get a replacement as all the disks had scratches and I've handled vinyl since I was pretty little and was taught to treat vinyl with respect.  Holier than thou, enter sandman, nothing else matters all had skips.  I'm used to pops and clicks even on clean vinyl but to where it skips for 1 second really angers me!<br /><br />Please for the sake of vinyl purchase poly sleeve and outer covers, because they're clear it makes it easier to remove the LP from the sleeve at least for me any way..  They also protect from scratches as paper and cardboard covers can and will scratch the vinyl.<br /><br />I really hope the replacement is free of scratches and playback defects..  Otherwise this would be perfect!<br /><br />The album get's 4/5 I gave it a 3 because of the scratches.
B007EE4XKI|2.0|This is only for ardent fans who like retcons upon retcons upon retcons. This seems to be the book's only purpose.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is a fantastic end to the trio of Batman movies made by Christopher Nolan, featuring Christian Bale as Batman.  Plenty of love, deceit, and action, the film doesn't fail to entertain.  Based on the Knightfall storyline from the comics, Bane (much improved over the version in Batman & Robin) takes over Gotham, breaking the Batman.  Batman has to fight his way back, redeeming himself and his city.  Featuring a major appearance by Catwoman (Anne Hathaway), the film gives a satisfying conclusion.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|good for the whole family.  we've watched this one 3 orf 4 times now.  Kids love it, and theres enough for mom and dad too.
0767827716|5.0|i liked it , i liked it this movie is that good, i can watch it over and over all the time
B007KUFDBY|5.0|My copy of the movie was received right on time, it was in good condition and I didn't have any problems. I love this movie for it's self empowering themes and i'm happy to watch it all over again now =)
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved this app until they destroyed it with such an ad-heavy display I can scarcely navigate the screens as easily as I could before. It was a seamless, streamlined app before. It was not broke, but they \\"fixed it\\"  anyway. A major shame. I have removed the app from my Kindle Fire HD and I am looking for a new weather app. So far Accuweather suffices.<br /><br />Recommendations are welcome!
B005VOXPWU|5.0|Worked perfectly for my grandson's project on polar bears. Would recommend them for this type of thing. Not so sure they'd be good for rough play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOO WORTH THE 7$<br /><br />MUST GET!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />disclamer: you will be addicted<br /><br />Take it from me, I reluctantly put the game down so I can write this review so u can get it
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|If you like action for actions sake, you'll probably like this movie.  Otherwise it's sort of a take it or leave it type movie.  The characters are shallow and the plot is thin and predictable, but it does have a few good action scenes.  It's worth a watch if you have nothing better available or are just curious, otherwise watch the better shows.  If you want a better movie in the same genre, watch \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\".
B007A2O3FO|5.0|as always this historical remembrance about the Emperor who succed Caligula give us a very different point of view about Claudio, he was intelligent, honest and learn to live in the roman empire world.
B0060D11OU|5.0|It is so refreshing to watch a movie for kids where there is literally not one questionable thing for them to view. No violence, no swearing, nothing scary. My 3 year old daughter absolutely LOVES it!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Great mental detox at the end of the day! Excellent soundtrack with puzzles just difficult enough to be engaging but not frustrating. Perfect 5
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|When I first heard about the new rendition of King Kong the quote was &#34;It's too long&#34;.<br />I took that response for more than face value; I was wrong.<br />The graphics and visual along with the acting is well worth 3 hours.<br />The love story between King Kong and Ann are an addition to why one should see this movie.<br />I love this movie.<br />I hate the part when he gets captured and killed but, the adventure is worth the ride.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Looking for a new series to watch. I use to watch the old one as a kid. It is really good.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|this is a book that transports you, as you were hoping.<br />it is only missing one star because my five-star category is reserved for the most amazing heart-lifting books in the universe.<br />this is adjacent.
B008133MDK|5.0|Best version of Sherlock, yet! I can not wait for the new season. Benedict Cumberpatch is a great actor. I recommend it to everyone.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|If this was a vinyl record it would be worn out by now...fortunately it is a CD, that has seen lots of play on our drive through PA to our son's place in Philly.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I was not able to see every season one episode and this provided me with a lot of information that filled in the holes for me.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Quirky characters and interesting storylines. Recommend highly to anyone who enjoys period pieces. Grab a cup o tea, sit back and enjoy.
B001FVD65O|1.0|This movie doesn't belong with the other Die Hard movies.  The Mcclain character always had a sense of honor but the son is this movie was whinny, disrespectful and had no moral compass.  Not enjoyable at all.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|Yes tactically it is a disaster. Everyone shoots from the hip, talking and telling jokes on patrol. Arnold telling his team to clear the area and leave no traces while he throws his shirt and cigar on the ground. Lots of action and some of the greatest one liners ever.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show.  It has a little of everything:  drama, quirks, and great comedic lines.  You can't stop watching.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Yes the book was better but the movie did not disappoint. Great acting and tense. Geronimo, for God and country.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|First I walked then I ran through this book! Laughed and cried. Poignant read. Recommend to adults and adolescents alike.
B00BBRPRDG|4.0|Ok I miss Paul Cotton. BUT, this IS POCO... this band always delivers fun, uplifting music...and they deliver here again on this wonderful album. How many bands have continued to deliver the goods for so many years? Pioneers of a genera...country rock...the vision of Richie Furay....and Rusty Young has kept it delivering ever since... you expect to hear POCO...as the band has delivered for so long...and this is POCO... wonderful album.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard has revolutionized the way I type on my phone.. I've always had trouble getting used to typing on touchscreen phones... (I'm old school). But since using SwiftKey it's been so easy... I love the way it predicts my sentences for me.. It learns how I type this is is everyday and just keeps getting better and better. I also love the recently introduced flow feature.. It's perfect for one handed typing a breeze. I wish I could give this more stars.. I highly recommend this keyboard as a replacement
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|Apparently she isn't our cup of tea.  Love the popular song but wasn't won over by the rest of the album.  But the price was right.
0425252868|5.0|I recommend this book. eventhough i was not born in WWII but it gives you a real nice background about had hapenned from both sides of the war with the pilots (Americans and German)
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I found myself skipping paragraphs about generals and battles and diplomats and blah, blah, blah. More of the characters would have been good.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|This series is awesome.  I love the characters and the story content.  It is humorous, exciting, and sad all at the same time.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|You can't beat Connelly for LA police procedurals.  The characters are good guy, bad guys no surprises here.  The only downside that as an avid short story reader, I read these several years ago.  But a reread was well worth the experience.
0062255657|3.0|okay not really something Id read again. I think this might have been a short story from the bottom of his pile.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|goes on a little too much with the who's who sections - but good and fills in some blanks in the story
1594484805|5.0|I ordered this to help with a project I am worked on at school as a writing coach and college teacher. I also used it to publish an article as part of my research.  This book was AWESOME and in perfect condition.  It shipped quickly and I had no issues. Pink is a FANTASTIC writer and teacher for us teachers - we need inspiration and he gives it in spades. Watch his TED talks.  He is amazing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Loved the action and the humor.  Can't wait for the next one!  I was really entertained.  It also reminded me of my own real life hero.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Always measures up.  Wonderful. Using this to show a clip at school was well worth it and easy to use.
B00BP4WAZS|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Disney/Pixar, but this one just didn't do it for me. The story line was boring and predictable and none of the characters were outrageous or interesting enough to steal the show. Sorry, thought this was a dud.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|i like the story line, love the action and it has some good twists to it :0) didnt see the ending coming :0)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I could not put this book aside.  I read all of the books in this series one after another.  I love that the tv series is following the story line, for the most part, and staying true to the story.  The world created in these books is breathtaking and I admire Mr. Martin's talent.  Please tell me book 6 is in the works.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|well written , well acted. very entertaining. this gives you a view & feel for the time period. it is great to be a king.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Beautiful movie, but it streamed to our TV poorly and kept interrupting to &#34;load&#34;. Not sure if this was due to troubles on our end or product, but I would highly recommend the movie.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|So you look at the cover and you think it just about 1 story. Well, that's what I thought, but it includes a bunch of other stories that have nothing to do about the first story. It was a little hard to understand, but I was overall happy with the book.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really liked this app at first.  I used it nearly every day.  I liked being able to choose the type of map shown, and I liked that it was labeled well and easy to use.  Ads were small, not intrusive at all, blended in fairly well.  This new update has screaming bright red ads that take up way too much space.  I might not mind if I could close or hide them, but they cover up part of the weather map.  My kindle has crashed 3 times while I tried using the updated app. I just installed the NOAA weather app.  I'm using that instead from now on.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have The Weather Channel on my computer as well.  Won't be without it.  Works well and easy to set up.
B00080ZG1A|4.0|Leonardo is a great actor.  We liked almost everything about it except the way he treated women.  Recommend to anyone who likes flying.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|If you enjoyed the metaphysical aspects of The Matrix series... you may enjoy this.  If you can keep the stories straight.<br />I enjoyed it enough.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|We love horses, especially my wife as she was raised on a farm.  We liked everything about it.  Seabiscuit was a special horse..  Recommend to anyone who likes horses and horse racing.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Not like the first one, but a good way to spend an hour and change.  I would tell my friends to give it a try.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is by far the best show.  I was so excited that season 3 came out on Amazon prime,  I haven't been able to get it on demand or Netflix!!  Thanks Amazon for being the first!!!  Anyway, all three seasons are wonderful.  I was hooked after watching the first episode of season one about four months ago.  Great stuff really.  I am not a big TV viewer because I can never seem to make the time to watch a show at a certain time and trying to find time in between the other viewers in my house, (we have one main tv and a small dinky one)  but I love that I can watch this show or any show on Amazon prime on my iPad.  Love it!!!!  Highly Highly recommend. I love historical fiction novels and movies, if you do than this is right up your alley.  Enjoy!!!
B001EJGQTU|5.0|Wish I had more time to go into this.  I show this film in my Film class every semester.  Love it.<br /><br />His use of his invention to place the camera behind the image of a human face----gets his subjects to open up more, and I believe this innovation really helped him win the Oscar.  But it's not just technical.  It makes the statement that understanding one's enemy and communication is so important before war.  We were so cocky in the Vietnam War we just ASSUMED we knew who we were fighting and why.  So sad.  If every warmonger in Washington saw this movie, perhaps something would change---if only a little.
B00C0233A0|4.0|Thought it was a pretty good movie ! A good addition to the Lord of the rings collection.<br />Great effects and scenery !
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Upsetting to see how slaves were considered property rather than people.  There were a lot of characters, and some of them didn't seem to be necessary.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Fascinating story. I have read a couple of Kate Morton's books and always find them delightful. Great for traveling and the beach.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|Too many people killed that really didn't need to be.  Chase and motives were fine, but violence was not necessary to those characters caught in the middle through no fault of their own.
B008LA7RMK|5.0|The condition of the cd is perfect and I have really enjoyed listening to it.  I had this vinyl album when i was a teenager and so glad I found it on Amazon.com<br /><br />Thank you, thank you!
B000EHNEDO|1.0|I ordered 5 movies in all, each one was an older classic. Four of them kept freezing and one would not play period.  This was such a complete disappointment. Some of them did not have the tape over the case as new movies do, although all them had the clear plastic wrap over the entire movie.  These were listed as new which I highly doubt. I will be returning all the movies.  If you are going to try to pass off movies as new at least make sure they can play.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|The First books were new to me ,but this one lacked the ability to really hold my attention and make me want to come back excited to read more
B00005R8GU|5.0|Haven't seen the Scorcese film, but I love this CD. Butterfield's scorching harp riffs and Muddy Waters vocals were both at top of their games and complemented each other like no other B&W blues band imaginable.. as suggested by the cover art!
B000001FDK|5.0|My daughter watched them for the first time a few months ago and can't get enough of these songs!  She even has them on her IPod and listens over and over.
B008YBOGVG|5.0|After waiting 34 years for a remaster of what was an extraordinary sounding album to begin with, I have been rewarded with one of the better remasters of the 21st Century. Not brickwalled which was my greatest fear, this sounds both warmer and clearer.<br />A winner!!!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This show just cracks me up for some reason!  Makes me feel so much better about my high school!  Love.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Have always loved it.  Have seen it in amateur productions as well as professional.  Bought it to view with our granddaughter whose ballet group performed a 10 minute summary.  She wanted to see the whole story.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|The code that comes with it is NOT WORKING! I tried it over and over and it its just not working. So I cant get MGS1 or the VR Missions or the graphic novels? what kind of collection is this?<br /><br />UPDATE:the code works now..
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Series:<br />After so much teasing about magic in the 1st season, it was very rewarding to see magic slip back into the world. Especially those damn-adorable baby dragons.<br />Plot-wise, I loved seeing how the 7 Kingdoms reacted to Ned Stark's investigation and wrongful execution.<br />-3 Kings rise to overthrow one, but the greed of one prevents them from working together to take on the strongest threat. Otherwise, False King Geoffrey's head would be piked by now.<br /><br />Danny's journey to, and in, Qarth was very rewarding. We see more and more how her love and commitment makes her better suited for the throne than any of the 4 Kings to the west.<br /><br />Jon's mission beyond The Wall isn't quite what I expected. The north is more tame than most give it credit, with the ever-elusive creatures still appearing as shadows. The Wildlings make the Crows of the south look more desperate than I realized. But the best part of this storyline is easily the last scene of the season.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|This story makes us think about our walking in circle sort of life. About the freedom that we think we have. About our fears to get out of our comfort zone and the price we pay for it. For me, it was a story to think about and compare to our life and its meaninglessness.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Excellent casting in a well-written story, with over-the-top violence.<br /><br />The characters' humanity is ironically what drives this story of vengeance. It's every characters' ruthlessness/submission that keeps them alive in a time with little room for a gray area.<br /><br />There's also a variety of comedic sub-types used throughout to keep the mood light when it really, really needs it.<br /><br />Easily one of my top-shelf movies.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a brave woman Jaycee is. I know it had to take a lot to share this story with the public. This is truly a heat wrenching story, but it truly opens my eyes. Her strength is incredible, this is a must read!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Disclosure:  bought this after watching &#34;Almost Famous&#34; DVD (also recently bought from Amazon).  It made me nostalgic for Elton John music.  That's something I never thought I'd say but he's got such great hits for almost 4 decades.  This arrived and let me tell you it is staying in its beautiful CD cover with little booklet attached.  Beautiful 2 CD and a little booklet -- 30 years of his music.  Wow.  You need to own this!
B007N85POS|5.0|This is one of my favorite versions of Angry Birds!  I love the music here and I love the fun in this game!
034580404X|4.0|She read right through the set in a few days! I'm guessing  she liked it, lol - if you like this type of book , I highly recommend it. Even great as a gift! Kinda of &#34;housewife porn&#34; , lol, but not too bad; just enough to WOW without disgusting some ppl. It's not for everyone, but most ppl will really enjoy this !<br />  Jenn~
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was enjoying the book until it just abruptly stopped with a lame not from the author about Eva and Gideon's journey not being over.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I really like this game fun and interesting. The only draw back is that it is not the full game so really it is not free. I would have been happier if it would say you need to buy to finish the levels.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a good book filled with a lot of action, very fast  paced , had a good selection of characters, the only part I disliked was the beginning, and I also thought the relationship between Jack and the girl were unnecessary though.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|If you need a good story with some action and enjoy the anti-hero story, this movie is for your enjoyment.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I was looking for a way to backup my pictures while on a trip and not have to take my computer. Ideal!!  Can easily copy data from my camera card to a thumb drive or even a portable USB drive.  Can do this under battery power or plugged into wall. Can initiate copies from iPhone or Android tablet using the wireless network this drive includes.<br /><br />Also, can watch movies stored on an inserted thumb drive. This allows me to access external storage and charge my Nexus 7 while charging my Nexus since I don't have to use the Nexus power port to connect a USB drive.<br /><br />Lastly, the wireless pass-through works fine to allow you to access your wireless network for internet access while using this one for your data.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Very good story, topical, current and entertaining! I should have viewed this at the theater. Do not miss this film, if you are a Die Hard fan!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|if it isn't pixar i don't think that highly of animated shows but this film is wonderfull, and i can't get enough of the minions
B003G4W49C|5.0|My dad made me read this and I have to say good choice I strongly engrouge many people read this
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good time waster for bed time when I can't sleep.  Keeps up a good challenge with each level. Absolutely worth the purchase.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|What happened to Treasa I think I spelt her name right. What happened to her or did I miss something? Anyway are they going to try a different method of finding a cure or what? I NEED TO KNOW!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and cool and I just love horses.it is really fun to play I love animals amzing
B0091REZMW|5.0|the graphics are amazing and it has a good plot. It doesn't really end so there is lots of fun and mysteries.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headset itself is great, but the problems is awful. It all started great the first week, but now I get random static noise. And the better quality the sound I'm listening to, the more static noise there is. I've searched for fixes, and nothing really works.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed Zero Day.  It was an easy, and relatively good read.  The plot kept my attention most of the time although some of the storyline was a bit predictable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very addicting and fun to play. Sucks you in like no other :) love this game! And I absolutely LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That I can play this offline! It totally blows if all your games are online and you are constantly on the road with no WiFi on your kindle.... friggen sucks!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|old version was much better and much easier to use. the site is way to &quot;busy&quot; with none weather items. give me back my old app!!
0670026603|5.0|This book grabs you from the first page and never lets you go.  This book stays with you long after you read it.  It is a powerful story that is just lovely.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I spent a Sunday just watching the entire season three, for the second time. The photography, sets, acting is all wonderful and enthralling. Can't wait for Season 4.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a really good game only problem is that I takes a lots of space but other than that is is better than subway surfers
B008UX2UIO|4.0|I've been having people tell me that this is a great book for years. I am glad I finally did. What fun!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Very reliable, come in handy when you need to store blue tooth and keeps the device charge.  Plan on ordering another.  Would highly recommend.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I thought it was boring and I just couldn't get into the characters. I am one to always finish a book no matter how bad it may be, but I have put this one away and am not sure I will finish it. At lease not right now.
0071390111|5.0|I thought I'd see what new things have been discovered since the last edition. EVERYTHING has changed! I had a mental map of neurons with high Cl- inside the membrane and higher Na+ on the outside. Action potential drops inside below 65mV and Na+ pours in toward the negative charge. The yet undiscovered Na+ pump, pumps out the sodium. NOW... Cl- doesn't seem to play a role. It's K+ inside the neuron now, which makes no sense to me chemically or electrically. How could Huxley's patch clamp data that's held up for so long and won him a Nobel Prize have been superseded? Hebbian Summation is different now...<br /><br />I guess when I finally finish this, I'll know.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|I used to be Mr Archer's fan. But after reading this book, I felt cheated! The worst I ever read. No plot, weak characters, stupid plans... I wouldn't even use it as a toilet paper (ok, I read it in a Kindle, but even if it were paper)...
034580709X|3.0|Jo Nesbo is a skilled writer, but I hated the book!  I found it very depressing, and I think real life carries enough depression without enduring it unrelieved in my entertainment.<br /><br />Some aspects of the book almost made it to excellence.  Nesbo's use of Aboriginal mythology was interesting and apparently accurate, and his naming of the book from that mythology was a nice touch.  So, too, was his naming sections of the book after characters in the mythology who resembled the character whose story formed a major part of that section.  I wish he had done more with this aspect of his book and also that he had shown us an Aborigine or two who had a more optimistic view and had succeeded in becoming bicultural (like some of the Native Americans I met while teaching on the \\"Big Res\\" for 15 years).  Joseph ALMOST achieves this -- especially with his skydiving at the end -- but because he usually is lying drunk in the park, it never gets beyond \\"almost.\\"<br /><br />However, the book is dominated by the outlook of Nesbo's characters.  All the characters that were fleshed out were (apparently) depressed, because none seemed able to see purpose in life or to feel that it mattered whether we humans do good or bad things.  All of them had major characteristics that society generally does not like, such as alcoholism, drug addiction, or homosexuality.  With the exception of Harry Hole, the other developed characters were from a sexual-preference minority or a racial minority, and it was these characters who were either doing evil or aware of who was -- without quite coming forth to address it.  It felt like the prejudice of the American newspapers of the early 1960s that always gave the names and details of minority accused criminals but withheld that information about white accused criminals.<br /><br />Policemen other than Andrew and Harry were cardboard characters.  Perhaps if Nesbo had fleshed out a couple of them, he could have offered some characters with a more optimistic view of life.  If the book HAD offered such a contrast, it would have made it much better without sacrificing reality because real life is made up of a mix of points of view among the characters -- and it is a truism that fiction should mirror real life.
B005N09L5C|3.0|Sound inconsistent, just did not have the same impact as the book. If you have not read the book you should. If you have read the book read it again.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|USED to be a good app.  Latest update totally ruined the layout. It's useless now . Deinstalled.<br />Note: It also won't fully uninstall... left bits of junk all over the system, even though it supposedly de-installed.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|What a treat to read Bill Bryson's &#34;spin&#34; on Aussie Land! I just wish I would have read it before I went there! Great fun!
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This is intended as light entertainment. Perhaps also social commentary but, if so, I don't agree with the author's views.<br /><br />This was OK as far as I got but I found most of it marginally funny, not more than that. The story doesn't engage on its own.<br /><br />I read perhaps 1/3 of the way through and decided it was not going to get better and gave up.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I love reading the classics on my Kindle.  Having the ability to look up words from the past so easily helps to easily follow the story.  I was only somewhat familar with the character Dracula and it was entertaining to learn the story from the original author.  I would recommend this book as well as other classics in the Kindle library.
B00555X8OA|5.0|My interest in this book had nothing to do with psychology or any of the other \\"soft sciences\\", at least on a formal basis. My interest is in how humans make decisions, specifically involving business or financial decisions.<br /><br />=== The Good Stuff ===<br /><br />* The book is relatively readable, and pretty much free from 15-letter words designed to bamboozle the reader. Most of the concepts come across fairly easily, although to really appreciate the content requires some work on the part of the reader.<br /><br />* The work is well organized, and builds upon itself without being inconsistent. Some of the arguments can get a bit pedantic, with finer points being argued that only seem like they could be of interest to PhD's in psychology. But for the most part, the material was eminently useful.<br /><br />* Perhaps the best point made is that everyone reads about the poor decision making skills of humans, but always believe that it applies to the whole human race except themselves. The authors do a great job of shaking this belief as they give the reader numerous opportunities to demonstrate their own decision making failure.<br /><br />=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===<br /><br />* The book can become a bit condescending at times. It typically assumes that the reader is mathematically and statistically incompetent, and lumps all readers together. I am certainly not a Nobel Prize caliber statistician, but I came to resent being treated like an idiot.<br /><br />* While the book is mostly fast-moving, there are times where it drags and gets wrapped up in details. I read the whole book, but believe that I wouldn't have missed much by skimming parts of the last two sections of the work.<br /><br />=== Summary ===<br /><br />The book was a bit of a tough read, but well worth the time and effort. I feel that I have learned much about decision making, both in others and myself. The bulk of the book maps into some very simple theories, the kind that you can remember and apply over time.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to just about everyone, but you will be much more impressed if you have ever considered how you (or anyone) makes decisions and values various options.d apply over time.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to just about everyone, but you will be much more impressed if you have ever considered how you (or anyone) makes decisions and values various options.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|You don't need to pay close attention, the characters are likable (except for the &#34;rebellious teen&#34; which I find annoying in almost any show and usually unnecessary), and the plots interesting.
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|I don't think anyone who isn't handicapped (full disclosure - I am not) what it's like to live with and navigate the world of the non handicapped. This is a touching story and has wonderful actors playing the roles.  It's well worth the price of admission although obviously not for younger eyes due to the subject content.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina relates her story in such a fun and funny narrative, it's hard to put the book down. Definitely not your typical autobiography.
B001EBWING|5.0|Wonderful movie. Virtually every scene is classic.<br /><br />I'm shocked, shocked that not everyone finds it so, but it seems to be true.
B007MDB71O|5.0|It could only have happened in the last few years and was masterfully created by Disney. To bring the wild imaginings of ERB to life took all that the current tech could offer. It did end my often used server administrator name \\"John Carter\\" and password martian. Oh well we should change those more often anyway. This film lived up to the spirit of the books with humor and the gutsy fighting spirit of JC. Even if they couldn't manage all of Woola's ten legs he is a treat to watch.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Did not expect too much. But this is really a fun movie.  Great acting all around. John Malkovich steals the show. (my personal favorite is Brian Cox)  Now I have to watch the sequel!  Recommended.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you love Neil Gaiman, you will find another reason to! He has come up with yet another way to manipulate physics and alternate realities combined with mysterious, believable - well, I'm willing to believe them anyway - and likable characters. Makes you want to go and see for yourself.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Sometimes I am not able to edit my comments, so I login my computer to do the editing.  This could also be accomplished if the edit-capability was improved.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|I thought that this would just be like reading the movie, but it's not.  it's even better, and full of differences that makes it stranger.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Enjoyed the characters.  Acting is very good.  Story is compelling.  But the pacing is ponderous and it could have been a good twenty minutes shorter.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Loved this game. It was a good challenge. I hate that I have completed the levels. Need more levels please.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|I downloaded it on my fire and played it but now can't purchase  anything to continue the game.  It was just a tease like so many of the games - play for awhile and then you have to buy something to go further.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Emma, Emma, please stick to more serious roles. Her hammy performance is more &#34;Nanny McPhee&#34; than &#34;Howard's End,&#34; but there is no Colin Firth to back her up or any eye candy to relieve the boredom. Jeremy Irons has been known to do this kind of stuff, so disappointment but no surprise that he was involved. Main characters poorly acted - where did those southern accents come from? - and not even any Jacob v. Edward kind of visual interest.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Deceptive video shows play on 3 tables, but the others are locked unless you purchase them for more money!<br /><br />It is crooked to bait people with gameplay that isn't included in the purchase!
B009R659L8|5.0|I would highly recommend it. Another great Mary Higgins Clark book. I enjoyed it  very much. Keeps the reader<br />entertained.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is better than the 1996 Gwyneth Paltrow movie version overall, except I liked that movie versions ending slightly more, but both are worth watching. Romola Garai as Emma and Jonny Lee Miller as Mr Knightley are both excellent.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I'm a Strokes fan but I was not sure about this latest effort until I gave it a 20th listen - and I'm really impressed for it's thoughtfulness. Great music, interesting lyrics, complicated passages and very upbeat.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I love Seinfeld and am sure that Seasons 1&2 are great, but I can't really review them.  Although I ordered Seasons 1&2, I received Season 3.  Because of some glitch, I wasn't allowed to return it (kept telling me my return time had elapsed although the date shown was a month away).  I decided to keep it because I was going to buy it eventually anyway and the price I paid was pretty low.  Despite all that, the discs are good quality and came well packaged and the show is great.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's very informative and helps me manage my time on my kindle so the battery doesn't die on me. I recommend this app
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King came through once again with a wonderful story anyone can relate to, especially if you have ever gone to a really good carnival! This one has a great twist and who doesn't like those? I recommend the book highly! Just wish it had also come as an e-book.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Out of all the games that require growing, quests, and annoying friends and neighbors,  this one is the most tolerable.  First, you know the characters,  and building a reef is pretty fun. Second,  the quests in here do not require you to annoy your friends for help. Next,  the quests are not impossible,  mostly just gathering and growing.  Lastly,  you don't need to spend money to enjoy the game unless you want to.  You have plenty of options in collecting pearls,  which makes it more fun in gaining rare plants and fish.  My only complaint is that there are not enough quests to fill you time and points between higher levels.  I'm patiently waiting for more quests and guest fish to come along and challenge me a little more.  Unlike castleville or other quest games that overflow you with way to many impossible quests, you don't have to be glued to the kindle all day with this game.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I really liked their last album, which made me skeptical about Native. When I saw Feel Again's MV for the first time on TV, it didn't impress me too much. I didn't decide to buy the album until I heard Counting Stars. After listening to the entire album after the purchase, I found so many tracks that I can listen to over and over again. Great lyrics and beats.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|We are reading the book and plan on seeing the show in NY, so we decided to watch the movie. It's delightful and well done. My daughter has also made her friends watch it.

B008FPOIT6|3.0|It is a good read, it reminds you of a Dan Brown mistery but it does not contain sufficient researched reality.
030789701X|1.0|No Glossary, no index, and things are categorized by area.  Try to find something?, good luck with this book.  Total waste of money, better to look it up on the internet.  True you can't have a walkthrough with Skyrim, it is not a linear tale.  but they should have the book organized so you can look up items and places in a timely manner.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Love the personality in each song, very down to earth and honest.  Love the entire cd and recommend it highly!
B000002KKK|5.0|Deguello is one of the ZZ Top albums that are a \\"must own.\\" From start to finish, there is not one dead track on the album. Deguello is also the last ZZ Top album before the 80s production beginning with El Loco, and was spared the retrofit remix inflicted on earlier albums. As such, it represents the end of a chapter for the band, and the overall best representation of their Texas boogie blues sound. I look at this track listing and I cannot choose a single song that I think is a clinker. Not one. A stellar effort from one of the best, and I Thank You.
0425266060|5.0|Guess I'm a hopeless romantic, but I read all 3 books and enjoyed every one of them.  Can't wait for the next 2 books coming out, hope they're worth the wait.  With all the complications between Gideon and Eva, I'm hoping for a happy ending...
B00BQ1DAHC|3.0|I'm going to go with what another reviewer said about this band sounding like a combination of Metallica and Godsmack. The production is top notch and the band definitely has talent. I enjoy listening to the CD but I've heard all of these songs before by other bands with different lyrics. The songs are good and Volbeat gets the formula right.
0345803493|5.0|Lady's you will love this book. It is romantic. Make sure to read book one which is fifty shades of gray. You will love it and it is work the money
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Decent family movie, not in the same league as many Pixar and Disney animated films, but still entertaining on day too hot to play outside.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I played this for HOURS AND HOURS. I would've played ALL day if my kindle didn't go outnof battery, lol. if there is a minion rush two,  could you guys make it so that it has three slots or sumthin? like three slots you could play,  because my family wants. to play on theirown slots too!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I watch a lot of PBS shows, but Downton Abbey has got to be the best yet. Lovable and detestable characters. Funny ones too. Love you, Granny!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This was a great movie, great history and acting. Amazon made is very easy to order this movie on our new TV.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|You can have multiple lists.  I have a list I keep up to date of my medications (and a different one for my husband) so when I go to the doctor (or hospital) and they want to know what medications I am on I can just look it up quickly and don't forget anything.  I use it for shopping lists and have a different list for each store.  I also use it for potential Christmas presents - someone mentions something they like in June then I am reminded in November.  Also use it when planning vacations - things to remember to take and things I want to do.  Can't believe it is free!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What can you say Potter lives on forever..My kids, 8 and 10 are just getting into Potter and love it..We listen to the audio books together then what the movies.....loads of fun....this is a great collection of dvds....great deal
B006PHD0RW|5.0|If you  tried the demo and liked it then you'll love this. There are so many new levels and more to come! It was definetly worth the 1.99$. It has a bunch of challenging levels and funny food puns. I got this at age 12 and am now 13 and I love this game. I don't know if anyone younger or older than me has played this game or is thinking about playing, but I definetly think that this is a good game for 12 to 13 year olds.
B003RV43X4|1.0|This movie was very poorly edited to point of ruining it.They simply placed a bunch of 3d special effects together and forgot the story line entirely. i am really glad i did not go to theater to see this.I have seen better b rated films.<br /><br />  DO NOT BUY THIS UNSEEN watch it first.
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|offers a lot of protection for the kindle while traveling, keeps it clean while not in use, light and easy to care for.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|It's nice to hear new music from them.  It's contemporary but still sounds like the NKOTB I remember from 20 years ago.  Hopefully they'll make more.  Love &#34;Survive You&#34; and the hidden track.  Still trying to find the track &#34;Block Party&#34; that I heard at their concert though:(
B008M721MS|1.0|This app crashes non-stop! Often times it simply REFUSES to work!! I can't even log in!! I have to re-download the app numerous times if I ever want to get anything done!!!
B000FBJG04|5.0|Kind of emabarrassing to admit, but I've watched this series 5-6 times, beginning to end.  I love the characters, who portray real people, the asides by those real people, the heartache, glory, and even humor found in this.  I even have the book!  And I have fallen in love with all these guys, well, almost all these guys.  They don't make them like these men, anymore.
B004UID2LC|1.0|My phone's antivirus software picked this up as malicious software and recommended removing.<br />Gone.  Never tried, so I don't know if it has any value other than what it is trying to steal for the programmer.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As with all of Khaled Hosseini's story lines, this one is based on the lives of Afghans .  But, these stories seem richer and told in more detail.  Overall, was an excellent read and I was disappointed only because I wanted more of it!
B00271B752|5.0|Young Pacino is great in this real life movie about corruption and the cops who take money.  It keeps you on edge watching.
B001DBOBDW|5.0|This CD has recorded pure art from phenomenal artists who obviously enjoy performing.  When you listen, you sense that you are right there at the concert.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Jonathan Rys Meyers is Henry VIII with all the politics at Court you would think its just another day at American Idol.  Superb acting from cast and early glimpse of a future hunk Superman Henry Cavill
B007N8RULO|3.0|the screen seems to small to play the game.  I.m used to playing it on my desktop computer.  But it's adequate if I wish to play away from home.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Awesome album. There's not one bad song on this album. All songs are feel good songs. Makes you wanna party and dance.
158270208X|5.0|This book is well put together and very easy to use and keep track. The magnetic lock is great, holds it shut but is easy to open
B0094M4Q3M|5.0|A classic.  I forgot what a great cast this movie has and it wasn't akward to watch with my teenage daughters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you are looking for an easy to use BASIC math calculator (as I was), this one certainly fills the bill! And it's FREE!
B003NX76BM|5.0|I really liked this book.  It kept my interest all the way through.  It was a great read for anyone that likes suspenseful stories.  I finished the book and wanted to read it all over again.  I wouldn't change a thing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the characters and how they interact.  Plot and mini plots are interesting and keeps you going for the next episode.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|Lizard was always a favourite. There was so much more going on here than on the previous two albums. I bought the vinyl in 1970 and played it over and over again in an attempt to grasp what seemed so easily grasped on the first two. This, i think, was the ultimate reward. Because there IS so much going on you come across something new each time. And now, with the release of the 5.1 version... wow! I stood centre stage in my living room, with the volume on 11 and absorbed the sheer majesty of this revitalized opus. I know it's not one of Fripp's favourites and I know Gordon Haskell and Andrew McCulloch struggled with it (hence their abrupt departure soon after recording finished) but for me it offered everything that is King Crimson... chaos, beauty, fire and the unknown. The jazzier element is also a winner. Not because it's jazz itself necessarily, but because it fully utilizes the wonderfully gifted players Fripp enlists from that field (particularly Keith Tippett). In The Court Of The Crimson King was, in it's day, ground-breaking but had a smoother sheen, In The Wake Of Poseidon tended toward treading water (but still had great elements), to me though, Lizard broke free (albeit only momentarily) charting its own unique course... a course that still remains unique when compared to all that surrounds it ans this new package brings out the best in what is a fine recording. I love it!
1451673442|5.0|Very informative. Explains things in a manner that anyone could understand...you don't have to understand quantum physics. Explains the power of the universe very well
B00499QUK2|4.0|While it may seem lacking when you've grown up with Basil R. if you throw away what you think you know, it is quite good. Little Bilbo, I mean Dr. Watson, plays a perfect counterpoint to an, at times, insane portrayal of our dear Sherlock. Put your calabash pipe away and step into a more modern era and I think you'll enjoy this presentation of Mr. Holmes and Co.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great game and has easy controls. It has inspired me to make many cool creations, and the mobs are awesome!!!!!!!!<br /><br />from jakeybeefburrito
0788859544|5.0|Bought it for my granddaughter. Brought back memories from when my kids were little. Loved just as much now as I did then.
0812993357|5.0|What a fascinating look into the world of fashion and how it has evolved over the years! Grace's short stories and blurbs are witty and endearing.  A must read for any fashion enthusiast.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I wish I could describe- in the same way Mr Hosseini does - how much I loved this book. So beautifully written. I am always so sorry when I finish reading one of his books because I know that I am going to battle to find another book that matches his.
B005NPBT5M|1.0|I down loaded these two songs and the first one should kind of blend into the next one.  Unfortunately the second doesn't even play all they way through.  I am in the process of trying to figure out how to be reimbursed for this one.  Don't mess with it.  Don't waste your money.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television, and season two has all the intrigue and ruthlessness that you could want from a show about the original crime family. Francois Arnaud is BRILLIANT as Cesare Borgia, and Holliday Grainger is fantastic as Lucrezia. Jeremy Iron as Pope Alexander is one of his best.Can't praise this show enough. . . I LOVE IT!!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a great summer read. What a great story, no matter how often I've read it. I can't get enough of the Bennetts and all their antics
B004U8VWLE|2.0|Lots of skill for a very shallow, dark ego story...............................substanceless...........a good reflection of our culture? Ego all over the place, where did the humane sense go???
B001ER4CNY|5.0|I was so happy when I saw this item on sale and even more excited when I finally. Received it. It was so cute that the carrying case in in the shape of Jeannie's bottle and the cards that were included with a description of every episode and show trivia is all so great. I am very pleased with my purchase
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This show is amazing, and the overall quality of the product itself is marred by the fact that I have issues with my hdmi connector that cause the online videos that stutter and then stop completely due to authentication issues. While this isn't the products fault, it forces me to use unbox, which does not support closed captions.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|A very sensitive and soul touching story.  Makes one want to discover life to the fullest.  I have watched it over and over and still receive the benefits.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|What can I say about this book. I liked the sex parts, but some of the dialogue came off a little pornish, bad pornish. And there was too much whining. I want a story with strong characters and strong dialogue. But, the last third of the book does make up for the beginning and the middle being a bit haggard.
B00BX50UEC|5.0|I got this product weeks before they said I would, and I now listen to this all the time! Very interesting and designed nicely! It makes me want to be at Eurovision!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I preferred the first book but it was a nice continuation of the series, the first being The Selection. A bit more serious than the first, which is perhaps a good thing.
1607886197|5.0|I liked the book thanks I like audio books so this was a good one to get. and I like nichodas sparks books
1476733953|4.0|I thoroughly reading the Wool omnibus. the characters were developed, held interest, and the dialogue was sophisticated.  The story line and the author's revealing of the nature of the post-apocalyptic earth was intriguing.  I gave this book four stars instead of five because the ending was trite and very unappealing.  I believe the author could have structured a more creative solution.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game on my Kindle Fire...but for $2.99 I expect it to take onger than 1 day!
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|My daughter and her friends love this. Fun game for girls to play together or alone. Good game for car trips.
0385344333|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher book. Make this book a movie, use Liam Neesam next time okay. He fits his description
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Definitely need to use your hints, but overall good game. If you like mystery games this is a good one to get.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|At first, I felt that the book wasn't for me. It was a little slow and at times too wordy. As I slowly read on, I became more and more interested. Soon enough, I couldn't put it down! It's such an interesting and well told chronicle of the author's life.
0792844890|5.0|Right uP THERE with &#34;Sherlock Holmes’ Smarter Brother&#34; another of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />I loved John Candy and love Rick Moranis ,,, loved the corny jokes with great delivery!<br /><br />Not too much extraneous BS ,,, not too much romance ,,, no exposed private parts.<br /><br />Loved the set design.<br /><br />One of Mel Brook's best.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Stayed true to the originals theme. The story was well told and the visual effects were excellent. The actors did a great job with the characters.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|out of all the games ive played and owned this is by far the best game i have played i cant put it down
B00B7Y0206|4.0|As an Android user, I use You Tube all the time, and this app is great and easy to use.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the narration of this book. It switches from the perspective of the main character, Pi, to the perspective of an author sent to Pi to hear his amazing story.<br />It's a great story that challenges believability.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Actually tells a story about a girl that's somewhat normal. Definitely a must watch for teens/young adults. Kept my attention.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is a story that was spell binding.  Amazing in many ways.  I felt the anxiousness of each character and made me wonder about North Korea in a whole different way.  I couldn't put it down, wanted to know how each character was to survive.  It made me do more research about N Korea. It is a perfect book for a book club, so much to discuss.  Highly recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|True to Nicholas Sparks, suspense, love and perseverance is all wrapped up in great characters with a twist you don't see coming. It goes to show you that life and love is truly a miracle and that angles and demons truly exist.
B00007KWHG|5.0|It's almost impossible to find an album that you love every song that's on it. But this is one of them. Makes my walk even more enjoyable!

B008VBYN80|3.0|Fun game to play a bit in the evening. Or in my case a lot during the day get it you will like it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this app is pretty cool. I played this game with my kids and they loved it. Will keep playing it.
0938045768|5.0|Very simple but difficult at the same time love it could not be any more happy with it help with be flexible
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game told me to write a review so I did. it is a very fun game.I would definitely recommend ky.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Lots of action and typical Tarentino humor and wit. But like most of Tarentino's movies though, their is gore and violence.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game that really makes you think. I had trouble on the last level. It's a great time killer that doesn't take forever to get through a level.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|One of the best movies made. A Fourth of July tradition for sure. Will Smith does a great job once again.
0887306667|4.0|I enjoyed this book, was easy to read and had some good ideas.  Price was right.  No complaints from me.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I know a lot of readers who were as wound up as me waiting for this third book to come out and if you are like me, you thought there would be finality.....but NO....doesn't end.  I was so upset at the end of this book that honestly, even though I LOVE Gideon and Eva, I more than likely will not read a 4th and God knows how many after that.  I think it is wrong to drag people along and stretch something out for $$.  As far as the storyline goes, I thought Gideon turned into an absolute wimp in this book.  Completely out of character from the previous two books.  Parts of the story were completely far fetched.  Why would they have to stay apart if in the last book the cop said case was closed because nothing could be proved against Gideon?  Really, REALLY disappointed with this book.  I would say don't bother but most people more than likely will.

B008BU75IQ|4.0|All three books should be read in sequence for the best effect and the most fun. I hope there will be a fourth and maybe fifth book in The Clifton Chronicles, because the ending in Best Kept Secret literally cries out for the next episode!
B00CU2S4J0|5.0|Probably the first movie that has a man impersonating a woman featuring Dustin Hoffman in the leading role in what can surely be claimed to be a classic that has spawned others like Mrs. Doubtfire.<br /><br />Beginning with an unknown actor, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, who has difficulty securing parts to play in movies as an actor, thereby, being unable to advance his career, the movie finds Hoffman dressing up as a woman to audition for a role in a television drama featuring, among others, the gorgeous Jessica Lange (who if looks could kill, would knock you dead in a minute), and, hence, securing the leading role in this medical drama series and spawning a huge fan base with women literally going gaga over Tootsie and turning the series into a phenomenal hit. Then, things go screwy as Tootsie, having read wrongly between the lines, feels that Jessica is attracted to him and makes overtures towards her - leading her to reach the conclusion that Tootsie is a lesbian, while Jessica's father falls heads over heels in love with Tootsie and proposes marriage; the lead actor in the drama series finding himself taken with Tootsie and serenades her in front of her apartment, and Dustin's girlfriend reaching the conclusion that he is a homosexual when he presents to her as a gift the strawberry covered chocolates given to him by Jessica's father that bears the inscription, \\"Thanks for a wonderful evening,\\" bearing his name and signature. Hilarious. A riot. A fine comedic classic.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I downloaded this for my 2 yr old granddaughter and then my older grandsons started to play.  I am now in a competition with them to see who can build their reef and attract the most fish.  Since we have parental controls on the systems they are unable to buy extras. I feel that games like this can be used to teach the wise use of resources.<br /><br />It has been enjoyable and we will continue to play and compete at least until school starts again.

0679720200|5.0|There has been a considerable amount of criticism surrounding this translation, particularly in respect to the style in which it is translated. Camus was inspired by an 'American' style, which in his mind essentially meant Hemingway. If you want to appreciate this translation properly then, I would recommend at least reading The Old Man and The Sea, and maybe a few Hemingway short stories to boot. I think this would remove a lot of the antipathy surrounding this version of The Stranger, a dry example of the true existentialist philosophy.

0385535147|5.0|THE RACKETEER is one big scam from beginning to end.  I hasten to add that it's written by John Grisham, in case you think I'm writing a negative review.  I'm not.  I'm just alerting you to the premise of the book.  Grisham's name will provide the motive to read it and his writing will generate the spark to create a best seller.<br /><br />A reviewer has to be careful about giving too much away with a book like this; with a storyline as thin as tissue, it would be easy to reveal it all.  In fact, this novel written by most other authors would be immediately assigned to the big stack of discount books at B&N.  All of the characters are sleazy with not an honest thought in their heads.  The cops are gullible and befuddled.  No one is likeable.  The frenetic travel is too exhausting to be believed. The plot is simplistic and completely predictable.  That's a lot of downside for a book that is so enjoyable to so many people.  Grisham turns a wart to pure gold.<br /><br />Grisham, from the beginning of his prolific career, was adept at taking mundane legal stuff and turning it into gems of intrigue that everyone seemed to be lusting for.  His clear treatment of complicated plots makes us all feel an integral part of his story, and he never loses us in tangles of sticky situations.  Everything comes out orderly and logical.  One can enjoy the story without a lot of contemplation as needed to read, say, Joyce or Faulkner.<br /><br />And so it is with THE RACKETEER.  We don't have to fall in love with the characters or spend a lot of time agonizing over life in prison.  There's no need to absorb the intricacies needed to handle gold.  We can just glide along with the story, close the book when it's over, and think about how much we enjoyed it.<br /><br />How does Grisham do it?  Believe me; a lot of wannabes would love to know the answer to that.  I attribute it to a wonderful way with language, an orderly and inventive mind, and the ability to keep his mind on his work.  I imagine that Grisham can sit down and crank out stories with one hand, play Mozart with the other, and tie a bow tie with his tongue at the same time, never missing a beat.  Oh the injustice of it all.<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALESimagine that Grisham can sit down and crank out stories with one hand, play Mozart with the other, and tie a bow tie with his tongue at the same time, never missing a beat.

B007MDB71O|5.0|This is at the top of my list in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.  My husband and I have watched it at least twenty times and hope for a sequel.  The only thing that can explain any poor box office performance is poor marketing.  I highly recommend this movie.

B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is one of my favorite books from my high school summer reading lists. I've kept my paperback copy for several years and have reread it a few times. I decided to upgrade to the digital version. (I haven't actually read the kindle version yet, so I can't comment on the quality of the text-to-digital &#34;translation.&#34;)
B0092QITO2|5.0|I bought this DVD because it had a great cast with Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, and Colin Farrell.  I have read other reviews that compare it to the original movie with Arnold as Quaid.  I don't know how true to the original short story either movie is but this movie is not really a remake of the Arnold movie.  I found it fun, fast paced, and had enough chases and explosions to keep me entertained.  I've watched it twice already and I'm sure I will watch it several times before I tire of it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series so jam packed of good storylines! Never a dull moment you have to watch it I can't wait for season 4

B00BWJARHO|1.0|I've never read the books, but one of the strenghts I've always heard people call to the stand in defense of Tolkien is the depth of his writing. This was the worst of actions movies. There was absolutely zero depth. The plot is shallow and everything that could be nuanced is dwarved in the film by the gaudy Monsanto CGI budget. I wished I hadn't wasted two hours of my life by the time it was finished.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Wonderfully surprising. Great plot and a lot of suspense. Very surprised at how much I enjoyed both the movie and book.
B0075LTOR2|5.0|this set is well worth every penny - especially if ur a fan of ROXY MUSIC...i've been listening 'non-stop' to them (in chronological order) since the day i rec'd the set.on top of that there r 2 Bonus Discs('SINGLES','B-SIDES' & 'ALTERNATIVE MIXES')that r OUTSTANDING in their own right with some music that i've never heard b4.it made me realize why i became infatuated with ROXY MUSIC back in the day and continue to favor today.the original album covers have been minituarized and duplicated to add to the atmosphere(unfortunately w/o lyrics).all in all/a good investment /in my humble opinion.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|A fantastic book that rambles through the life of Kvothe. It follows the irregularity with which normal life exists. As in many distractions and small events occur that wrap the reader up in the situation, such as the basilisk attack, or the trip to the Adem homeland. The author gives you a strong taste and imagery without setting everything on the table all at once. All the while you have a slight foreshadowing that these seemingly insignificant distractions are building up the character of Kvothe into the man he will be, which is a distinct change from the boy you are reading about (or rather being told about by Kvothe as a simple bartender.) I absolutely love when an author can allow information to drip into the story artfully over time giving you a grand picture of the culture or landscape over time. In terms of my appreciation of a story, character development, and unique multi-faceted character portrayal Mr. Rothfuss is at the top of the game. His dynamics reminds me of George RR Martin, without losing me in a mass of unending characters. I am constantly left wanting to find Kvothe's love interest wander back into the story, so that that longing in Kvothe can be satiated. Thank you Rothfuss for perhaps my favorite incomplete epic.
1434404374|3.0|Despite being a fan of mystery novels, I've tended to avoid Christie--I read a book of short stories by her, and did not find them to my taste. But after enjoying the David Suchet Poirot adaptions, I thought I should at least try her novels, so I did. I picked this one, because it's her first Poirot novel, and I like to start at the beginning. Bleh.<br /><br />The writing and dialogue is a trite, cliched mess. To help prove this claim, I would like to present exhibit A: '\\"Oh, dear, sir,\\" cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, \\"what ever shall we do?\\"'. No, the entire book isn't that bad, but it's never *too* far above that level. Nothing nice to say there.<br /><br />The secondary characters are poorly-drawn stock characters--we have the foolish old woman who's being taken advantage of by a fortune-hunter; said fortune-hunter; friend of the old woman who has absolutely no personality or character traits except that she hates the fortune-hunter; and then a bunch of characters so completely nondescript that even a one-sentence summary is impossible. Oh, we're *told* they have personality traits: after an entire novel of a female character never exhibiting any signs of jealousy, we're assured (as a major plot point, no less) that she's an extremely jealous woman. We're told that Nondescript Male Character A doesn't like Nondescript Female Character B (not that Nondescript Female Character B cares or anything! Awkward and poorly-written romance, ho!); I think maybe they talk once during the entire book?<br /><br />Elements of the mystery were clever, but looking back at the book, I feel that the murderer acted in a nonsensical way (the great problem with reviewing mysteries where you find the resolution unsatisfactory is that you can't, of course, explain why). Also, because of the way the book was structured, a key piece of evidence had to sit around for months, and although Christie tried to explain (through Poirot) why the murderer didn't destroy it, I didn't buy it for aminute. Christie definitely demonstrates the gift of waving clues in her readers' faces without ever letting on that they're clues at all, and does it more-or-less well; minor things that the reader barely notices becomes important later, but the key to the entire mystery doesn't lie in a single detail mentioned briefly in a conversation somewhere that the reader doesn't even remember, something that can happen when a writer is trying too hard to be clever.<br /><br />I did like the interplay between the narrator, Captain Hastings, as his (completely unjustified) pomposity and Poirot's (completely justified) pomposity sometimes clash. Poirot strikes me as a character who would get old fast (in fact, Agatha Christie apparently got quite sick of him, although never sick enough to throw away the financial security he offered). Inspector Japp, who I know and like from the television series, appears as a complete non-entity; probably Christie hadn't had him in mind as a recurring character when she wrote this.<br /><br />I call this novel a freshman effort in the title of my review, but I might as well mention in the body as well that yes, I realize that this is her first novel. But even if that explains the flaws, it doesn't make them go away. A Christie fan who's never read her first Poirot novel (and first novel, period) might find it an interesting curiosity, but I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone else.

1781162646|4.0|I have only recently begun reading Stephen King.  The way I read is I find a book I really love, and then try to read everything I can by that author.  I thought that King only wrote horror though (talking with people, that is a common assumption, it turns out).  So after I fell in love with 11-22-63, I started reading all the King books I could (except for the horror, that is, but maybe one day...)  I am just amazed at the wide variety of genres he has so beautifully mastered in his career, and lucky for me, my latest author has no shortage of novels to make my way through...<br />So Joyland is set in an amusement park in the 70s, and the main character is Devin Jones, a college student with his first real job (as a \\"carny\\") who is going through his first real breakup.  It's a nostalgic type novel, and I felt as if I was in the setting as I was reading (although I am not male, never worked at a fair, and was a teen in the '90s...somehow the story telling transported me).  There is a story that goes around that the ghost of a young woman who was killed a few years back on one of the rides haunts that ride.  Devin becomes interested in the story and goes about investigating the murder.  Along the way, he makses friends who will change his life forever, including a young boy who is dying and his young mother, who becomes something of a love interest.  This is a quick read (esp. when you're used to reading some of Kings thousand pagers), and has a love story, a story of friendship, mystery, and a touch of the supernatural.  I would recommend this book for anyone, as it has a little something for everybody.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I got this book even though I had read the negative reviews, so I guess I knew what I was going into!  Still, I thought everyone was complaining only because this was not the final book (as it was supposed to be).  I thought that maybe the book would be good, that everyone was disappointed because they were left hanging.<br />No.  I was really impressed with the first two books, at least so far as this genre goes.  I read some quality novels and then I read this \\"smut\\" I like to say.  But as far as smut goes, this was the best quality smut I've read.  I was particularly impressed by the storyline in Reflected in You.  But this one just had no real story.  Nothing really went anywhere.  I couldn't tell you what the actual plot was, and all the sex scenes just got annoying.  This really was just filler stuff to stretch this series into five books, and I really don't think I'll read the last two.

B008AUGEFC|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a tour de force of literary genres. With six protagonists and six separate, but interconnected, plots, it is a highly ambitious novel. One section takes the form of an interview, another a series of letters, a third follows the form of a journal. The first story pauses halfway through when the second story begins, and so on, with the sixth story told uninterrupted at the novel's center. After the sixth story ends, the fifth one resumes, and then the fourth picks up again, and so on, making the novel's second half a cascade of revelations and conclusions. The novel moves across time and space, yet the same themes are woven throughout it. Mitchell is profoundly concerned with ethics, so his fiction is full of excellent cultural criticism.

B00AB7IA1S|3.0|This is a simple game with entertaining gameplay.  The graphics are good - you can zoom in and out and move the course around in 3D.  The object of the game is to get the flying ships from point A to point B using fans to control the direction the ships travel.  The challenge is to figure out how to get them to their destination around/over various obstacles in the way.  It gets more challenging as you complete more levels, but it is not too difficult.  You will get different kinds of fans as you progress, like ones that lift the ships up over the cliffs/mountains/bridges instead of just changing their direction.  Unfortunately thats about all there is to it... all the levels are basically the same, they just get more complicated as you progress.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Nice graphics.<br />+ It is entertaining to figure out how to get the ships to their destination.<br />+ Good tutorials and hints.<br />+ Music is not annoying.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Repetitive gameplay - all the levels are pretty similar.<br />- Not much replay value - once you finish a level you know exactly how it needs to be set up, so playing multiple times would get pretty boring.<br />- Developers collects \\"analytics\\" which are not clearly defined (they say no personal information is collected however).<br /><br />I think it is worth a try as the free app of the day, but I would not pay for it because I will not want to play it over again after completing it the first time.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I actually bought this for my daughters. It's just &#34;ok&#34; in my opinion but the kids like it a lot.
0062059963|4.0|America, making it into the final round of the competition to be crowned the next princess of Ilea. Only 6 girls left each with characteristics that would make a good royalty. Except America, the lowest caste member left. She quickly learns that she has to fight extra hard to prove her worthiness. But first she must convince herself this is the role she really wants to take. Being royalty in a broken country rely on more than just love.<br /><br /> The writing has a pretty constant pacing and well rounded characters. Although in this book I think more drama is thrown in as the race is getting tighter. The fun part for me is learning about how the country was reconstructed after the 4th world war, the current caste system that is used and differences in how they live now compared to our time.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|As a teacher and a parent to preteen boys it is often difficult to find books for boys that do not include sci-fi or fantasy. I enjoy that this series has a character that is relatable and realistic. It is written in a flowing manner that makes the book a fun and easy read. I recommend this book for boys, girls and adults.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and more  excitement than surfer subway!!!!! My little cousin got me addicted to this game! I would lime recommended everyone to download this game!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel was too hard to watch when he was destroying his life.  but in the end he resurrected his life and followed his moral compass.
0385311400|5.0|This book came to me in perfect condition, dust cover also. It came before the expected date, too. Thank you so much. I have read the whole series at least once, and now reading them again as they come, one by one. Thanks again. I rate it 5 stars!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|We actually looked forward to this movie. In reality this was a visually beautiful movie. The story line was a bit weird and had an interesting twist at the end. All in all, a decent movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game play does not disappoint. It is a short 4 level game but very enjoyable. Would love to play more levels.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|many times you worry about the content before your children watch a movie but this one was clean .  Thumbs up!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so worth it but that's all I can say because I 've only wached my friends play it.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|great cast! john Malcovich was the highlight of the movie.  Government uses our heroes and throws them away.  Bruce is the standout .
B009G497L4|5.0|The set comes with:<br />The Illuminated box (wich you may have to change the batteries for). A 7\\" by 9\\" poster. A $30 gift card for SIdeshow Collectables who only sells things more expensive then $30. A 200 page Marvel character guide that is very awesome and interesting. And the 4 disc movie itself that comes with a holographic slipcover. Great product.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 as the show is terrific. Great set of characters and compelling drama makes it one of the more interesting shows on television.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a very good book in a great series. It's a very dark story but well written. I would recommend it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|after reading this book I changed my view to my partner and myself. our relationship became stronger. I recomend this book for all those who want better understanding in family and relationships
B00B52F278|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE A LOT.  I REALLY LIKE THE SUBJECT MATTER AND LOVE MOVIES OF THIS ERA.  IT IS VERY EXCITING MOVIE AND HAS A LOT OF ACTION IN IT.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I love Phillip, I'm a 65  yr old woman who is an Idol fan, and this album did not disappoint me - it was GREAT!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|ok, it's not mind-blowingly challenging, but it does require some brain work.  I downloaded the game to my kindle fire and there were no glitches or delays.  I didn't start playing until late one night & found it very addictive.  fortunately, it only has 10 levels, so I was able to sleep after I completed all the levels.  the limit of 10 levels, however, is also my only complaint.  MobiGrow claims more levels are coming soon - I hope they carry through with their promise.  the challenges of each level are similar enough to the previous levels to allow you to pick the game up quickly, yet different enough to keep the game interesting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game I played,I love this game I can't wait for the movie people in the world
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is a very good book, although a dark story. It is well wrItten part of a series. Great author. I would recommend the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I love that it's free. And whoever made this game is a genius and is brilliant
B0060MYK7G|3.0|I LIKED THE FIRST SEASON, BU THE SECOND SEASON i DIDN'T LIKE AS WELL, IT WAS OK..AND DON'T WANT TO SAY IT WAS DUE TO DVD, IT IS JUST MY LIKENESS.
B004US4K2C|1.0|The launcher is nice. Unfortunately it comes with a whole bunch of SPAM and outright bloatware attached to it.<br />If you want to turn you phone into a digital trashcan, by all means go ahead and download it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One week I was not feeling very good and even spent some time in the hospital.  My sister-in-law suggested I start watching this series since I was going to be in bed for a while.  HOLY COW! I LOVED IT!  I watched all of season 1, 2, & 3 in a row and was sad when I learned that season 4 hasn't aired yet!  I will be looking forward to it when it does come out.  I began to feel apart of their lives.  If there is a highlight of my illness... uninterrupted Downton Abbey on an iPad would be it. :)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a nice application. It has a simple job - providing me information about my battery status that it does quietly and well.  It is there when I want it to be and stays out of the way when I don't need it. Very well balanced design.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|Always a great go to movie. Have seen it many times. So goad to see the whole series. This is the best.
B000021XR5|5.0|Every STP album represents a different era of a band that has many colors! This was in a sense the 'return to grunge' or whatever... but in reality, it was the beginning of a band that plays everything. From heavy crunchy rock, to melodic pop confections... everything as the band. STP!<br /><br />Of course, like all of the STP albums, one listen doesn't grasp what's going on beneath the surface. There is not one single song that these guys have ever recorded that isn't awesome. Some times it takes a couple of listens. My favorite songs on this album are the ones you probably don't know...HEAVEN AND HOTRODS, NO WAY OUT, GLIDE, ATLANTA etc. Everything is pisser!<br /><br />After this one, go dig out Shangri La Dee Da... Don't worry it also rules! Even the new single on the radio in 2013 is actually pretty ok...even though Chester Bennington is a BALL bag. Its the band, man! But bring back Scott. Hopefully these guys will manage to get it together again someday, somehow, and give us one more from the core! Peace!
B009LDD54K|3.0|THIS MOVIE WAS NOT FOR ME.  IN FACT THE WHOLE SERIES WAS NOT MY CUP OF TEA.  THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE BEGINNING AND FOR MY PREFERENCE, NOT FOR ME.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Very little information on his NDE. waste of money, and way too New Age! I should have known it would not be good if Oprah Winfrey promoted it. ​
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My son seems to enjoy the game. I have heard no complaints. 8 more words required is a bs way to calculate getting a review from me...
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|The cinema photography was really good, but the story line was a bit wavering and too long.  I couldn't show this to my 7 year old because of the length of the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love love love this series!!! This book could have ended a little different, but I can't wait for the next to find out what happens.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Easy to keep your knives sharp. Simple and compact. Instructions are easy to follow hand no problem being a first time user.
B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|THIS MOVIE WAS NOT FOR ME. IN FACT THE WHOLE SERIES WAS NOT MY CUP OF TEA. THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE BEGINNING AND FOR MY PREFERENCE, NOT FOR ME.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Following the story further down the line after the first two books was awesome.  Thank goodness a sequel is promised!
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I like getting the extended editions because they tell the story better, the theatrical editions are a story some editor wants you to see. I don't like being told what is better by some person that don't know how to tie their shoes, they still believe in the tooth fairy
0307887898|5.0|For anyone thinking of a business opportunity, research, testing, writing a business plan or capital raising, STOP now and buy this book! Utterly useful, zero fluff, I'm kicking myself wishing I had read it sooner!<br /><br />Employing the Lean Startup methods means starting with the things that can kill your startup first eg it's no use drafting marketing strategies if nobody wants to buy your product. It educates the reader on what to start with first to eliminate wastage (time & resources), how to test your assumptions, how to avoid focussing on the wrong things/measures, and how to direct your testing/experiments to drive your bottom line etc.<br /><br />Enough said, go read it!
0151003084|5.0|The art, the writing... it's dismal & wonderful! I highly recommend this book! My family loves it, my sister and her family love it! My coworkers think it's sick.. you decide.
B00821OX98|4.0|I usually like anything Spielberg has been involved with.  I love Sci-fi flicks, but they have to have great actors, believable props, and a storyline that makes you feel involved.  This series gives me all of that.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|I listened to this album over and over when I was a kid.  It brings back so many memories.  I loved them then and I love them now!
B002YDRA22|5.0|Great movie. This movie really shows how it must have been in the 60s. Let the good times roll:) I highly recommend that you watch this movie.
B00APVC8BI|4.0|I like getting the extended editions because they tell the story better, the theatrical editions are a story some editor wants you to see. I don't like being told what is better by some person that don't know how to tie their shoes, they still believe in the tooth fairy
B009AMANBA|5.0|I bought this for my mother as a gift and she absolutely loves it. It must be a pretty good movie.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time. So much more than a \\"zombie\\" show. The show is probably a very good example of what would happen in a \\"zombie apocalypes\\", in terms of how people would handle it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a good read for the most part. I felt the story was well written and balanced. However it was at times a little broken up, which made it a bit confusing from time to time. The characters are well rounded and created perfectly for the plot. My only complaint was the ending, it left the situation unresolved.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|It's the Beatles.  What more do you want?  I loved this album when it first came out and I still love it!
B000JZ3TYA|3.0|This movie is fun to watch and by being as sometimes unsettling as it is and often very frustrating the thing kind of pulls your psychological chain in an entertaining way, even though it is about as implausible as the most wild of sci-fi movies.<br /><br />However, technically I had problems with my DVD copy (stock number 22447). I watched it a couple of years back when I still did not an HDMI hookup and I used the three-wire, component-video alternative. My set (a Samsung) easily expanded the non-anamorphic image to fill out my 56-inch screen, and so THAT time it was a pleasure to watch, in spite of the loss of resolution with that kind of low-tech letterboxing.<br /><br />However, I recently watched it again (or, rather, tried to watch it), this time with a full HDMI connection from my player. Guess what? My Samsung TV actually LOSES some of its image-expansion and shaping abilities with the HDMI feed, and so the best I could do with the movie was watch it with the 4:3 setting, which delivered a reduced-size wide-screen image in the middle of the TV screen.<br /><br />What this movie needs (and perhaps later versions have it) is a true anamorphic squeeze, so that not only do we get more resolution with the image \\"un-squeezed,\\" but also so that my Samsung TV's more high-tech image expansion feature with the HDMI hookup will work properly.<br /><br />The version I have is too retro-tech, in spite of the THX certification, to operate to best effect with an HDMI link - at least with my set. Admittedly, the 5.1 sound quality was excellent.<br /><br />I am reluctant to purchase a replacement via Amazon, because I fear that what will be delivered will have the same limitations as the copy I have now.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Very good story line with a solid cast. Packed with action and mysterious ploys by the invaders. Give the series a try and you will be hooked!
B001EBWIPE|5.0|This is a brilliant comedy of manners.  The cast is excellent, all at their best.  The writing is witty and timeless; the jokes are often subtle, based on word choices and phrasing and this cast excels at that.  I've seen it half a dozen times over the years and enjoy it every time.
007174889X|5.0|we bought a &#34;used&#34; book and we received a new one , and the price was excellent!!! Harrison´s it the best internal  medicine book
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I rented Monsters Inc because we are going to see the new Monster's movie this weekend and wanted to see the first one.  She is 4 years old and Just loved the movie!
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|The book was very practical and allowed me to make my career transition more manageable & fulfilling. I'm already starting to  add value to my organization a  month & a half  into the new role (quick wins & low hanging  fruit) - something I would have not been able to achieve on my own.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a great book but I think Suzanne Collins could make a 3d book please be aware of my love for the book
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good app and I use it almost every day.  I would recommend it to anyone who has facebook.  I is a good way to keep up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After the first episode of the first season I was hooked and had to watch them all.  Very exited for season four.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher books and Tom Cruise is not Jack Reacher.In every book Jack IS described as 6'5,250 some pounds,has sandy blonde hair.Does Tom even come close to that? NO!They could have put in stilettos and he still would not have come close.What a farce.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Exactly what the title implies; this movie is pointless. A boorish circle that ends with characters in exactly the same desperate situation the started in.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it is a good game but it takes up to much memory for 11.2mb.it is extremely glitchy I don't like how you have to download a file. gameloft needs to redo the format of this game despretly I would recomemd this game to people who would over look the problems in the game and has a lot of memory on device.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I was not expecting it to be a nice box set, I assumed it would just be the usual single dvd case with two dvds. I was pleasantly surprised!
B0018OFN2W|3.0|It was better than some of the other of that genre, however, my complaint is that you don't offer captioning which I need at times.  I hope you make this adjustment soon.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|This was the first novel that I read with my 5 year old. I was suprised how well the story held his attention (with only a few illustrations). It moved along at the right pace and with the right amount of querky adventures that hits a pre-schooler's funny bone. Sadly \\"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\\" hasn't been able to re-create the magic.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I discovered the series late in the season and it grabbed me right away...enough to get me to purchase the entire season to get caught up! 2 stories at once.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Loved the storyline and the Swedish sense of humour. Best book i've read in a long time.  Not many books make me laugh out loud, but this one did!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It's very entertaining though a bit absurd at all the 11th hour miracles to win or settle court cases, but that's the nature of a TV series.  As someone who watches from the sidelines on my husband's campaigns, this series is a magnification of how the public either gushes over a candidate or continuously plots his or her downfall.  That much I find to be true.  I enjoy it for the entertainment value and not the true life accuracy.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I watched the video that someone did to so how this camara bag could be used.  When the bag arrived I felt like I had some ideas as to the best way to use it.  Everything went in with some space left over.  The quality and construction of the bag seems excellant.  The idea of a backpack is also very appealing to me, leaving arms and hands free.<br /><br />Overall a great purchase.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Great Movie my 4 year old grandson loves it you can watch it over and over again which he did.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Awesome! This book isn't my favorite but is one of his best books. Grab a tissue box and a nice blanket it's worth the read!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is seriously one of the most refreshing books I've read in quite a while. To watch a self proclaimed playboy fall desperately in love is always entertaining, to live in his head while its happening.... Well, that's just priceless. These characters were so well written, the story was very well thought out and the levity in tense moments was perfect. Drew is so wickedly inappropriate, you have to love him. I HIGHLY recommend this book!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have had the weather channel app since I got my Kindle almost a year and a half ago.  I loved how I could swipe between locations because I travel a lot and could easily check my different stops.  Now with this new update it is like a whole different app and I hate it.  I now am looking for a new app to replace this one.  It is harder to navigate and has ads galore which I hate.  It is missing pollen casts and other features from the old version.  The old version wasn't broken, they shouldn't have tried to &quot;fix&quot; it.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This is a CD I can listen to the whole way through - can't find that too much anymore. Like the direction they've gone.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|After randomly finding The Selection in the book store  I couldn't wait to read The Elite. Needless to say it did not disappoint. It leaves you craving both reformation and romance in a dystopian future. Plus, Kierra Cass is awesome. Seriously, go read her acknowledgements. You'll love her. Only disappointment is that I have to wait for The One to come out!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|When they recently updated this app, they forgot to include the hourly weather forecast. Previously it was possible to ignore the advertisements but now it is in your face. The new design is interesting but very busy. It does remember all the locations you entered (I had about 10 and counting when I deleted it). The maps look great but the animation doesn't really work so again no hourly forecast.<br />I recently purchased the accu weather app ($0.99) and I love it! No advertising, hourly reports, sends notifications to my kindle fire, simple to use, maps work.<br />I recommend the accu weather app over the weather channel app.
B004GISPEA|5.0|I've been a fan of animated film for a while now, both mainstream and underground, and this is by far the most impressive animated movie ever.<br /><br />The different animation styles, the intense, poetic story lines, and the overall MIND THRILLER this movie entails is superb.<br /><br />If you're looking for something super trippy to watch and to bend your mind - sober or not - this movie will trip you out with heavy and uplifting story lines, thought provoking themes, and off the walls animation.<br /><br />A must see for any animated film fan. I'm buying it.... NOW!!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This is one of the best magic the gathering games I've played in a long time. Trial version is good but any true player will find buying the full game worth while.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great read! Intense and well written. Held my interest with that &#34;can't set book down&#34; feeling! No ho hum drag out fillers.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Great movie.  Probably the best of the series.  Recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh or two or three.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is epic so fun get it get it now<br />Now I said now!I mean making your own army base fighting enemy<br /><br />AA@
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Reminded me of the movie with Heath Ledger and Matt Damon called The Brothers Grimm. Dark fantasy with a few comedic moments throughout. Part of the movie's appeal is that it obviously didn't take itself too seriously. Great cast. Fairly intense violence. Witches were genuinely scary.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is sooooo GREAT aha! Me and my classmates are into this game. Enjoying and stress remover lol :D Bananaaaaaaa!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game to pass the time with while waiting on appointments,Drs,Clients, or just resting in bed, being in the hospital or for relaxation.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love all of Follett's books and can not wait for the last of this trilogy. Read and enjoyed the 1st  2.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It fixed my Jonesing for MTG when I didn't have someone to play with. It helped me make less mistakes during real game play just practicing timing.<br />BTW- you get a RL promo card after you buy the game, look under promotions!<br />I have recommended it to friends already!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game to play although a little short. I appreciate the fact there is a walkthrough because I wasn't sure how to start. After the initial nudge it was good to go. Hope the updates come sooner rather than later and, hopefully, won't cost anything. Cool app.
B007MJSYF0|2.0|Watched because it was recommended. Lame, gratuitous violence. Acting was terrible. Movie premise was so absurd that you wonder if whoever made it isn't nuts. One of those movie where after you watch it, you can't believe that you actually did.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Sturdy, yet lightweight and easily adjustable to fit my needs. Reasonably priced and received promptly. Bright color makes it easy to spot. I think any Kindle reader would be satisfied with this cover.
B001DE29SS|5.0|This a great classic movie.  Downey Jr, acting is impeccable. It is a little rushed, nevertheless a great film. Entertaining, and a mixture of drama and comedy.  Great DVD, in pristine condition. Will buy from again.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Good Day To Die Hard is a very good movie to AVOID. Plot is bad, acting bad, screen play bad. Only reason for one star is fairly good stunts even if not plausible. Over all movie is just BAD!
0345529057|5.0|I started watching the show before I started reading the books, and I am so glad that I made this purchase.  As good as the show is, the books are even better!  I liked having the first 4 right here so that I could just plow through them.  If you're a fantasy reader, this is a must have!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|I had to keep reading just one more page. could not put it down. I have recommended it to many.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|it is a really fun game but I ran out of money (bingo blitz money) and I coildnt play anymore
B005FITIF0|5.0|I loved this movie. It was very inspiring and the acting was too notch. This was in my opinion Gerard Butlers best performance.  5/5 Schmoes!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read?  Very philosophical and right on! A must read for everyone of all ages
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|entertaining, challenging, frustrating,  I'm really unsure how it really works. I guess it is the luck of the drop of candies and where they land. Just something to pass the time
0553801473|5.0|I'm still finishing up Feast of Crows, but I can't wait to dig into the fifth installment of Game of thrones.  The book came in excellent shape and I'm excited to read more than a mass market paperback version.
1781162646|5.0|I really enjoyed this fairly short story.  Not typical Stephen King. I read it pretty quickly and could not put it down.
B0093Q9YNQ|5.0|This is by far my favorite musical. I really like the song in the opening. I have this movie on DVD, and I thought this would be nice to get on my kindle.
B003B96AOW|5.0|DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY SO!? GOTTA ORDER NOW! GOTTA ORDER NOW! PLEASE DON'T LET ME SING THIS AGAIN! GOTTA ORDER NOW! GOTTA GOTTA ORDER ORDER!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|The main reason I bought this CD was for &#34;the boy's round here&#34;. Great song and it's a good album. I like all of the songs on here. I especially like it when you can listed to cuts of each song before buying the CD. Makes it real nice. I would recommend this CD to anyone. That's why I gave it 5 *.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I really enjoyed watching it!! The music is awesome and I can not wait till season 2 comes on prime!!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I liked the movie, but I loved the score.  It's great background music when working on stuff for school.  Howard Shore does it again!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book makes the series, it is awesome I think it's great the only complaint that I have is that everything happens so fast it would be great if we cold get more time in between all the stories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been addicted to this game ever since i first played it! The only downside is my nephew deleted all of my data, so I had to restart. :( but this game is just so darn fun!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It was a fun game but it could have been longer but all in all it was fun so it's worth the money to play!!!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Lady Antebellum are just great. The song Need you Now is why I got this CD. The rest of the songs are also good. Who doesn't like Lady Antebellum.. .they're just hot.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I'm an old school comic geek. I can still enjoy this new universe. Soon enough, there will be another reboot, I will like this one for what it is.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|What is there to say? The Goonies might be the best movie ever. I was definitely my favorite movie when I was a child.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|The third book gives a perfect ending to the story, the additional material at the end of he book it's just amazing, hopefully we will get another book with Christian's POV that will be the best!
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Miss Potter was a wonderful story filled with .love and imagination. I would rent it again and tell others about it. :)
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Wow well I'm so gonna  buy the next book! This is worth the buy. Read the book, then watch the show :D
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood is amazing. I love Blown Away. This who CD just rocks. She's a great singer and should have more than 5*'s. You will NOT be disappointed if you buy this CD. And HEY... it's not just for the young crowd either, cause I'm 71 and LOVE IT.
B000063V8T|5.0|The product was just right in every way. I really enjoyed all the episodes and I thinking about getting the third season
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|We love ghosty stories that build from the subtle to the terrifying.  This one, as the predecessors, really hits the spot!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book start is great, however the introduction of Christian's life to Ana is a little bit too much but it is what it is, I just wished everything was happening slower, everything happens in a matter of hours, but it's great writting
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is  one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films. I've been meaning to purchase this for a while now, and I'm so happy I finally did. The story is unique and special. I'd recommend this to anyone who has a love for animation and storytelling.

B001XUH69Y|5.0|Bogart and Bacall...what more needs to be said?  We christened our new Roku device (which is the best way we have found to access Amazon Prime streaming video on the TV rather than computer or tablet) with a family viewing of Casablanca. Simply timeless!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game I have ever play great way to have fun just run and duck. The minions are so funny and goofy and dumb.

0385342071|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was so funny and definitely an easy read. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Kinsella's books.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Though it is interesting to explore perspectives of how the human race will continue its existance after worldwide destruction, I can visualize this entire Saga as a movie. I was continually reminded of the Hunger Games (Juliette v. Katniss; Bernard v. President Snow; unraveling administration/governmental lies to bring about uprisings and wars, etc.). As for the plot itself, it was excellent in the beginning, as hooked as hooked can be (when we first learn about Holston, the cleanings, and the inner workings of the underground silo), but I tapered out by the 3rd section and I found myself trudging through the enourmous amounts of extraneous detail that distracted from the plot. If reading novels about futuristic, post-apocalyptic society survival is your thing, than definitely read this book. Personally, this genre is not for me, so I won't likely continue reading the Saga.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|The dvds and cds work great, ive watched it twice already and love it. for the chheap price it was definatly worth it.
B009NX61JY|5.0|I love the way they become good friends which leads to them falling in love with each other.<br />I love it when Rose tells him you were the first to want to marry me for any reason.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I'm glad I lost the DVD copy I had because this 3D blue ray Avatar release has excellent color & sharpness. Worth getting!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I was excited about this game until it took 3 hours to download.  Then once I did get a chance to start game play it lagged and was not responding.  Finally it  crashed my kindle fire. I was so frustrated I uninstalled.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the Hunger Games saga. This is my first digital book and I am completly satisfied. It is so easy to read and has different view options.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I always loved Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and the books are hilarious but this book wasnt as funny. I bought this book about 6 months ago and read half and just yesterday finished the rest... I guess that sort of tells you that i kinda got bored while I was reading it. But anyways, its still a good book, its worth buying.
B001BANK32|5.0|Very exciting and spooky.  Explains a lot that was in the movie but was unexplained.  A first-rate thriller. And the characters are very vivid and real.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|No book has ever entertained like this one. From start to finish I was swept up into the story. It was as if I became Jane Eyre as I felt every emotion she felt. Wish the story never had to end.
1616550414|5.0|This book is chock full of all the artwork and stories dating all the way back to the original NES game.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Great perspective on the &#34;flow&#34; of our intrinsic motivation. Great for managers to read in order to allow your team to get into a productive flow of activity.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I looooove Once Upon a Time! Big fan! Love the HD definition and the bonus features, especially the audio comentary of the 7:15 episode, were josh and ginny are flirting all the time :)
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice app.  Can't figure out how to delete cities.  The radar is nice but slow.  The rest of the app is pretty good.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I never thought I would enjoy a book from the male point of view so much!!! Drew may just be one of my favorite male characters ever. He is honest and real and so damn funny!! And Kate is just that girl that most of us can all relate to! I hope we get more books or at least a novella about these two lovebirds!!!
B0000714BP|5.0|What wonderful actions between the 3 main characters, and a great lesson in humanity, too. These three very masculine actors are mesmerizing dressed as women. They do so much good in a very small town, while waiting for their car to be repaired. One of my favorites and I watch it over and over.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Really awesome show, once i started watching it was really hard to stop, I've been recommending it to everyone i know
B00CF34B2I|2.0|tried to buy full version several times but doesn't go through. go to app store after to get something else and no problem.
B000HL2J0G|2.0|But now, well...It is certainly over the top 80s stuff. The acting, the scriptwriting, the music. You cringe when watching.
0345803493|5.0|I was delightfully impressed by this authors writing. you actually felt like you was there with the characters and they felt like old friends. Mr, Gray is a character That I wont soon forget.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's obviously written for young adult, with the constant listing of exact steps, but beyond that it's engaging and a lovely tale of survival.
B00BSW29OE|3.0|My daughter had to read this for school and I read everything she does in case there any questions I can try to explain to her, but this book, while informative, had a bad way of running a whole lot of things together in an uncohesive way. I had to reread some parts multiple times to keep everyone and everything together in my head. I told her to take active notes while reading so she could answer her school work. Even that only helped a little bit.
0345529057|5.0|Allowed me to play catch up no the series without having to piece together a set from some random book store
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft is sucks and is the worst game in the universe and I feel bad for the people who spent they're money on it this game is a rip off
0345803507|5.0|bought these as a group was really impressed with the quality . The books arrived in great condition and was relly impressed how quick that they arrived.
B00D8WIWQG|5.0|Thought it was good before, but I love the extra songs. You also get a feel for their live shows, which are great.
B006LSZECO|2.0|you can almost guess immediately what happened to Amy.  None of the characters are likable.  Completion of the story is ridiculous.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is SUCH a cute movie. It is totally safe for children to watch. I am an adult and this is by far the cutest movie I've seen in a while! I cannot wait to see Despicable Me 2.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very fun and interesting game! Great graphics! Love how your city keeps running and keeps earning money even when your not playing! Can be a little confusing sometimes though. But love this game!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The Orphan Train was true and I heard my father tell of it so decided to read it.  The blending of the young foster child and the old lady was well done.  People who haven't heard of the Orphan Train will enjoy it for the emotional blending of the characters<br />How both young girl and the child from the orphan train depict the troubles of our times and how human nature doesn't change.<br />Our book club is reading it now .
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game. I just wish the extras didn't cost so much and would really like it if once you pass  a level you earned bubble cash.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It was a unique perspective.  Touching journey for the family.  Kept me interested throughout the book.  and I like happy endings.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is definitely one of those movies that no one remembers ever hearing about when it was in theatres, but everyone seems to love when they actually see it. A fun science fiction / historical fantasy movie with little regard for physics. Lots of fun!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This game is very entertaining.<br />Keeps my girls busy and quiet.<br />The graphics are very bright and very similar to the movie
0345803485|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised how good these books are. I mean the whole trilogy. Characters (mainly Christian) are very flawed and unique people. Advise is; you must read all 3 books. Like Twilight books, this is really one long story spread over 3 books. But you dont get bored or wait for something to happen. The sex scenes are hot, but even the kinky stuff is well written and not just sex-for-the-sake-of-sex.
B0035G04TI|5.0|By coincidence, I stumbled upon this book and purchased it right away.  What I find essential about this book is once you identify the persons Love Language the quality of the relationship could possibly improve immediately; since it clearly correlates to understanding your family, friends, companion etc., and hopefully they're pleased during the interaction (especially if they're unaware of the fact that you read the book).<br /><br />So far, I have used these 5 Principles in any appropriate setting and the beauty of it all is that it works for males and females alike, and moreover, if you're open to the concept - you'll learn something about yourself.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Lots of fun. Easy and lots of different ways to play...random, always win. Almost as fun as the computer version. I can play it for hours.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I don't know why android people don't hate the new update I mean the music is way worse and the new episode just changes the gameplay...... all most no android people hate it but over a LOT BUT REALLY A LOT! Apple people really but really hate the new update I checked almost all android June reviews and was stunned! They were almost all 3 , 4 , and 5 stars!!!! -_-
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Loving Suits on Amazon Prime. Great picture quality and works seamlessly between my ipad and my Roku on my TV. In terms of the show, the writing is superb and the banter between the characters is very real and fast paced.
0375869026|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read, (that's not in a series). Wonder is an amazing tale of love, sadness, and occasionally anger, wrapped up in a very interesting 300 pages. Wonder is about a boy named August who has a face disorder, and how he makes new friends at his new school. I would recommend this to anybody, especially to any young readers who are looking for a nice novel.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Movie was good but disturbing.  I have 2 children and this movie really creeped me out.  The killing was difficult to watch
B000FA5STS|5.0|This book has enlightened my awareness microcomputers can become one of our greatest assets or one of our biggest problems. It shows how many lives can be destroyed or manipulated out of control. One needs to watch one puts into this control box called a computer.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|my girls enjoyed Oz, very much, I found some parts a bit boring, however, it is a great kids movie.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Leonard Cohen once said that the highest an artist/musician can aspire to, is making an album with two or three durable classic. Well, Tool have, with this masterpiece. I am sure that Wings for Marie part 2 and Right in two will stand as enduring classics. Then maybe some of the tracks may have less value - I for one don`t know about the instrumentals on the album. Some say they are interesting departures, some say filler - I ´m not sure. But I do know that this album is what turned me into a diehard Tool fan, in a way Undertow or Aenima never would or could. Let the complainers whine about Tool having let them down for not remaking their older stuff. Let them turn to ACDC or Status Quo, who have made basically the same album a dozen times. This is a band in continuing evolution. I can`t wait for the next step.<br /><br />.
0061900656|5.0|My two year old loves this book. Very easy for them to understand! And teaches them a lot. Very well written
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's so much fun and addictive ! You can design and name your own city . I can play for hours
B001EBYM62|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is my favorite of the big 50's MGM musicals. My sons love it as well and told their kindergarten teacher it was their favorite.  Needless to say, she was surprised!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|It's great big help for my diarys while I am in the hospital for transplant I have been looking for the perfect way to express my thoughts and feeling cuz I can't see well enough to write about it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|all of a sudden got a different version.  hate it. no more hourly forecast, can't read info over a glaring picture.  want my old version back!!!!!  I will be removing it from. my device.
B009CF7JDU|3.0|It is just silly diverting entertainment...good for a rainy afternoon. I forgot how some of the sight gags are not all that funny anymore. But the scene on the float is still pretty good.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the sizzle and love between Gideon and Eva. He sounds divine and will do anything for the love of his life!
B00821OX98|4.0|Story line is believable. Episodes are not predictable and acting is very good. I would recommend for all syfi enthusiasts.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|very interesting documentary about one of my favorite rock and roll bands.  Very well made.  Enjoyed it a great deal!!
B000HCO83Q|2.0|X-Men the Last Stand is the film which marked the downfall of the X-Men franchise.  After X2 Brian Singer left the franchise to work on Superman Returns.  However, the studio wanted a new X-Men film as soon as possible, so they went on without Singer.  The series has never been the same since.  This film and every movie since have been incredible mediocre.  While this movie has great effects, great action, and can be entertaining, it is a big step down from the first two films.<br /><br />One thing that I hated was the killing of certain characters like they were nothing.  Cyclops is shafted even more here than in the first two movies, which is not a good thing.  Within the first half hour he is killed unceremoniously like he never mattered.  Cyclops is supposed to be the leader of the X-Men, so for him to get killed like he did is an insult to his character.  Professor X also gets the ax is this film in an equally idiotic fashion.  What is worse is that there is virtually no impact in both Cyclops and Professor X's deaths.  The rest of the team mourn but then move on like a scene or two later.<br /><br />If they did this to try to make the film darker then they totally failed.  Another bad aspect of this film is that it has a very uneven tone.  There are times where it is very dark and gritty and at other times where it feels very silly like Juggernaut doing one-liners or the X-Men cracking jokes while in the middle of a huge battle.  The point is that sometimes the film is very dark but at other times it is a fun comic book film, which is very weird.  I do not quite know who this movie is for.<br /><br />They introduce new mutants, like Angel, just for them to play a very minor role or do basically nothing.  These mutants are in the film just to be in the film and that is all.  The only new mutant that gets any push in the movie is Beast.  Beast is great and is one of the better aspects about the movie.  Other main characters from the other movies are just tossedaside like they do not matter.  Mystic and Rogue, who were both important characters in the previous films, are given nothing to do and are barely in the movie.<br /><br />I also did not like how they handled Jean Grey in this film.  In this movie they try to adapt the Phoenix saga from the comics.  However, the Phoenix is portrayed very different here than the source material.  In the comics the Phoenix is a symbiotic fire entity that possessed Jean and gave her the power to burn everything to ashes.  In the film the Phoenix is Jean's dual personality that was created from Professor X sealing up part of Jean's abilities when she was younger.  I do not care for this at all.  If they were trying to go for a more realistic approach then they failed.  If anything it made it sillier.<br /><br />The good aspects of this film are definitely the action scenes.  This film I will say has the best action scenes of all the X-Men films.  The final battle was especially enjoyable.  The effects are also phenomenal.  The effects for Beast are especially good.  This Beast looks ten times better than the Beast in X-Men First Class, which is sad because this film was made in 2006 compared to 2011.  They also got a better actor to play the role.  Ian McKellen does great once again as Magneto.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is still a badass.<br /><br />Overall, X-Men the Last Stand is an entertaining film as far as action goes.  However, the problems are major ones and besides the action the film is not very fun to sit through.  It was depressing really.  I do not recommend this to fans of the comics or fans of the first two films.  If you just want great action then give it a look.  The rest, however, I do not recommend it.
B005544V6A|5.0|Witty. Smart. Quick retorts.  Love it.  The really attractive cast with the really attractive wardrobe doesn't hurt either.  Fun to watch.
B00000K2W1|5.0|The quality of the CD is good.  All the tunes on this album are familiar, reminds me of the &#34;good old days&#34;.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|French has put together a great story from historical facts. A great way of learning about China prior to the war, to have a good mystery, and an enjoyable immensely readable book!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|very cute app. the game has many dragons and both my children ask daily if there are any new ones hatching.  money will help you get things faster but is not necessary to play and get everything if you are patient enough.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|\\"Angel, a crowd of millions couldn't hide you from me. I found you once. I'll always find you.<br /><br />  Okay, so I was about 65% through this when a FB friend of mine mentioned it was taking a hit with bad reviews on Amazon. Like the masochist I am I checked a few of those reviews out, which admittedly made me nervous the closer I got to the end of the book (there was a lot of grumbling about the ending). But once I finished, I was trying to figure out why everyone's panties were in such a twist. I have gone through some epic cliffhangers in the past, but this was NOT one of them. Sure, there where a few new questions that opened up towards the end, but nothing heart-stopping. And honestly, there was a press release AGES ago that the series was being extended to five books (which I'm totally freakin stoked about BTW) so I'm having a hard time understanding all the anger at the story not being wrapped up in a pretty little bow when we are only halfway through the series. Personally, I LOVED THIS BOOK!!<br /><br />\\"A winery for a casino, huh? So you remain the god of sex, vice, and recreation.\\"<br />\\"Endeavors that help satisfy you, my goddess of desire, pleasure, and corny one-liners.\\"<br /><br />  I fall further in love with this series & these characters with every book. Though, I will admit to some major annoyance at Brett & Corinne. Plus Deanna just flat out pissed me off. I loved that we got a little personal with Clancy & Angus, Eva's mom took crazy to a whole new level & Eva's dad was just...Wow. Cary is Cary, that boy breaks my heart and is in serious need of an intervention. Ireland starts to become a bigger part of Gideon's life, which was super sweet to see. But the continuously evolving state of Gideon & Eva's relationship takes center stage.<br /><br />\\"We are totally dysfunctional.\\" \\"I prefer 'selectively deviant.' But we'll keep that to ourselves.\\"<br /><br />  These two may still have a crap-ton of issues between them, but as a couple they have grown sooo much. Their obsession with each other is still ever present and their love shines brightly, but they are starting to learn how to navigate through the growing list of problems & keeping some sanity. But most importantly, they do it together.<br /><br />\\"Shut up, caveman. I'm not into that 'me Cross, you Cross little woman' bulls***. In case you've forgotten already, we made a trade. You got me, and I got you. I protect what's mine.\\"<br />\\"Eva, don't fight my battles for me. I can take care of myself.\\"<br />\\"I know that. You've been doing it your whole life. Now, you've got me. I can handle this one.\\"<br />\\"I don't want you to have to deal with my past.\\"<br />\\"You dealt with mine.\\"<br />\\"That was different.\\"<br />\\"A threat is a threat, ace. We're in this together.\\"<br /><br />  The biggest issue they have to deal with in this book is the fallout of Nathan's murder, which at times brought tears to my eyes. You don't realize how strongly it affects Gideon til it's slapping you in the face. It definitely adds a strain to an already tumultuous relationship. The sex is as hott as ever but what I loved the most was the quiet times between the two, seeing Gideon laugh & joke around was amazing.<br /><br />\\"Waking up to you is like...presents on Christmas morning.\\"<br />\\"For your convenience, I'm already unwrapped. Batteries not required.\\"<br />\\"You're like a delicious extravagance for a woman, you know. A luscious, mouthwatering-\\"<br />\\"Shut up. I'm filthy rich, but you just want me for my body.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're my lucky charm.\\"<br />\\"Really?\\"<br />\\"Yep.\\" He licked the upper swell of my breast. \\"You're magically delicious.\\"<br />\\"Oh my God!\\" I laughed. \\"Cheesy.\\"<br />\\"I did warn you about me and romance.\\"<br /><br />  Lots of surprises, angst, drama & tears. I'm very much looking forward to what happens next. These two hold my heart, I love the way they are growing as individuals and as a couple. The road ahead is far from clear & I can't wait to see how they handle it. Plus, I'm anxious to see where everyone else's story goes.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\"<br /><br />\\"You'll never lose me, angel. Wherever you go, however far, I'll be right here with you.\\"ndle it. Plus, I'm anxious to see where everyone else's story goes.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|It is a great bag and it has many compartments to carry your lens and other accessories. It is easy to carry too and has protection cover from rain. It is must if you are having a DSLR with many lenses.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Classic CD.  Sounds great.  Reminds me of the &#34;good old days.&#34;  The tunes are all classics.  The cost is very reasonable.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My teenage daughter and I both liked this movie a lot. The action is fun and fast moving and the characters are interesting.  And yes, the minions are really cute.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I used the word \\"deliberateness\\" in the title of my review because I'm trying to avoid use of the word \\"slow.\\"  The truth is... this movie does begin a bit slowly... much like the characters it depicts.  And that would not necessarily be a criticism--I love character-built films and books--except that while we are strolling our way through the exposition on this fabulous ensemble cast, the tone is just a tad on the dark side.  And it's not the dark comical sort of gallows humor such as we see in films like Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (suggested if you need a bit of a lift after this one); it truly is an \\"old age isn't for sissies\\" themed piece, with very little comic relief to make us believe there will be hand-holding and tenderness throughout.<br /><br />Still... I didn't think I could love Dame Maggie Smith any more than I already do from her impressive career, but I found even deeper levels of her talent here.  In fact, there are splendid performances here by Pauline Collins (pitch perfect in her role, really), Tom Courtenay, and I would be remiss if I didn't confess I've never been able to help being a little in love with Billy Connolly, no matter what role he plays.  Michael Gambon is great as well, although his role doesn't ask much of him.<br /><br />I think if one understands that this film was first a stage play, one has a better appreciation of what Dustin Hoffman was trying to do.  Moving a drama from a live theater audience to a movie-going public audience is nearly always problematic.  For some reason we expect to find cynicism in the theater but happily-ever-after in the movies.  Or at least, I do.<br /><br />All things considered, this film touches on several issues dear to my heart, not the least of which is recognition of what our seniors have to offer if we will but listen.  My favorite part had to be when \\"Reg\\" explains to a young man the difference between opera and rap.  Brilliant.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very easy app to use. I love all the features this app gives you to choose from. And you can even play more than one sound at a time. You can play even several different ones all at once. I have told several friends about this app.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|the movie was just as good as the show.  I love the storyline but bad actors could ruin it  but I would have to say theses award winners did it justice.
B001G0DDA2|4.0|it sound good to hear so I can follow alone easy. I commend the people who like bourne. it is good
B0030MM68O|5.0|Great movie everything is good and we'll balanced great action / drama movie I love war type movies this one of those
0385333846|5.0|What can I say, it's a good quality book. If you haven't read it, it's necessary reading for the history of Science Fiction.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game is one of the few that I poor hours into. I love the graphics and it reminds me of the walking dead with the plane
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great writting and i'm glad they history is not finished yet. Can wait for the fourth book!!!when its comming out?
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|bought this movie because of the positive reviews and the description sounded good.  After watching it, didn't like it as much as many people stated.  I found it kind-of weird.  It seemed weird to me that it was almost like there was two different plot lines and it jumped back and forth between the two.  The ending was odd how they connected the two plot lines.  definately was not the worst movie I have seen, but will probably never watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love love love this game! I would not change one thing about it. My kids are the ones that got me hooked. They needed some help with one of the levels and now we all play!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It needs to b updated but it's good it is way faster than other Facebook apps think it will work for me
B006N0YWGY|2.0|The controls are so sluggish on my Droid 4, I can't do anything but bang into walls. Luckily I didn't pay for it.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|It was funny and entertaining.  I enjoy anything Barbra Streisand does.  I'm so happy that Amazon is now offering movies.
B000S1LUE6|5.0|Wow this was a great book.  Simple, EZ and enlightening.  A wake up call for those who think &#34;yo9u should know how to love me!&#34;
B005R32L66|2.0|A bit clunky and causes my computer to freeze from time to time unless I prevent it from running in the backround.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is 1 of the best books ever. And for me a lot of books I loose interest but not this one  it had me the whole book!
B00CY1JUW2|3.0|Overall, this is my least favorite QotSA album.  It has some good songs and I have grown to like the album a little more than when I first bought it, however, I went back and listed to the other albums and they are much better.  I think it's hard to pull off a great album with only 10 songs.  The songs make you wonder if Josh Homme is feeling really depressed or going through a midlife crisis or \\"what does it all mean\\" stage in life.  The album from Them Crooked Vultures is better than this album.  I hope Them Crooked Vultures puts out another album eventually.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is one of my go to places.I don't know how I lived without it I could spend hours and hours on this site.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|A wonderful book that will touch your heart. Nicholas Sparks sure knows how to write a beautiful touching love story.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I had fun going back and forth with my boyfriend to play this game. We both have Kindles so it was fun to play while on our own devices. However, we quickly started to see some duplicate words. It's fun, but I think if you get into it, the pay version may be worth the price.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I wanna say that it is possible that you can also find it to be the best game ever
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a wonderful book and as I sit here after turning the last page, I have been drawn into a warm and beautiful saga of a nation and it's people......
B00CT2P6VA|3.0|Another game that was worth trying...the graphics were interesting to me and I liked them but I would rather play other games.
1451695195|1.0|This book makes lots of promises but never delivers.  Very flimsy, new-age account with few details to really flesh out the story.  The title is truly a misnomer!
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|This movie looked wonderful in the trailers and I had been looking forward to watching it with my family at home on DVD, since I rarely go to the movie theaters anymore.  I was surprised that the movie did not do very well in the theaters, but decided to watch it anyway.  I finally saw it, and I think I understand why this movie was not well received.<br /><br />The movie has nice special effects that still have a sort of classic film look to it.  This was as intended by the makers of the movie.  The result is that it does not look as \\"high-tech\\" or realistic as other movies made nowadays, but still manages to feel magical in an old-fashioned way.  The story was original, based on the books by L. Frank Baum.  I was particularly moved by the character of Theodora (Mila Kunis).  I felt that the development of this character was very well done.  The cast did a good job generally speaking, and they were well cast.<br /><br />The real problem with this story, in my opinion, was the character of Oz.  James Franco did an excellent job as Oz, however his character was just not likable.  It's hard to root for a main character when he is a coward, selfish, a womanizer, a liar, and has generally no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Moreover, there is no real character development until the very end when he has some sort of epiphany and seemingly changes his ways.  The truth is that at this point of the movie, it's not realistic and is too little too late.  With the exception of his interactions with China Girl, he spends most of the movie demonstrating his low quality as a person.  The romance he has with the good witch was rushed and not believable.  In my opinion, if a romance is not developed correctly, the movie is probably better off without it.  The end result is that rooting for Oz is nearly impossible.  I found myself rooting for Theodora over Oz towards the end of the movie.  Considering Oz is the main character and Theodora is a wicked witch that is a bad thing.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but not as good as it could have been.  If they ever make another Oz movie focusing on these characters, they should really stay away from Oz as a main character and perhaps focus more on Theodora.  She is a tortured soul and, while tragic, is potentially much more interesting than the \\"not-so great or powerful\\" Oz.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I think even a poorly written book about Steve Jobs might have proven enjoyable for me, as I knew little of Mr. Jobs' story and yet work in the engineering and technology field.  But I do feel that Walter Isaacson has done quite well at delivering a great read from out of the surely vast available information on a modern-day innovator and celebrity.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I am very interested in anything about photography and I am sure I will be using this a lot with my photos.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|It was okay, but maybe this is just not my genre or maybe I was just not in the mood. I seem to enjoy comedies more when it comes to television shows and dramas and thrillers more when I comes to movies, so I guess you will have to make your decision about whether you would like to see this or not :/
B00005N6KG|2.0|I bought 2 pair of these headphones a few months ago @$9.99 each. Although these are absoultely great, the fact that this seller has increased the price all the way to $29.99 each is price gauging and hideous!! Its shameful! I wanted another 2 pairs for my niece and nephew, but at this price, they can keep it!! I will check other places to buy these or just go with the similar brand and style ... Koss headphones. So disappointed in the greed :(
B008Y73940|5.0|The movie follows the book closely.  Great plot and I didn't guess the ending for once which for me is always a bonus!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Never had so much fun with a app. The This one is cool.The puzzles are very unique.Clever game and so much Fun game love it .
B001ILHY2C|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun.  There are some plot holes, but overall its just fun to watch the cars and the girls.  The 2nd movie is not bad either.  I recommend it as a good action movie, but don't expect anything more than that.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence and blood, as expected, and a lot of cursing.  I don't recall there being any sex or nudity.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Good adventure movie that's great for the family. I was pleasantly suprised by the lack if swear words which is rare in Hollywood movies these days.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Great story based on history although not exactly correct in all details.  This is my 3rd time to watch the series.  Excellent, interesting, entertaining especially for history buffs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game to exercise your sluthing skills. Try and find the clues and escape from the rooms. Some are tricky!
B00CS65JS2|4.0|I like this, it is very good chill music.  It's growing on me, but I could tell right away that I won't like it as much as Discovery.  I guess there is just no topping discovery.  That said, its nice to have a whole new album, and not just a random single.  It is alright, I like to listen to it while I do something else.  It is total chill music.  I won't be singing along or playing air guitar to this like I did with Discovery, but its still worth listening to.
B008602KQI|5.0|Came right out and showed the distinct class systems within the lower classes that embodies the movie and and how those in the upper classes deal with waging of wars with the lower those societies population leaving the elite out of it much like today. It has a George Orwell sense / feeling  to it... Well filmed and story plot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST NEW SHOWS ANYWHERE.THE  CAST<br />AND CREW DO A GREAT JOB. THE WRITER KEEPS YOU<br />GUESSING ALL THE TIME.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this game would be fun BUT its very slow and scratches up a lot. I wouldnt recomend this game if you dont have patience
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Boring but Maggie Smith still hits a home run. Disjointed script and the ending is obvious from the start of the movie. Would not recommend.
B00APUQYJQ|5.0|Basically this is a \\"one actor\\" movie and I think Mr. Pattinson did a tremendous job.  It was a very deep book and story to begin with but he did an amazing job.  I think the public should have had the chance to view it in our theatres but since the critics didn't like it we were not given that opportunity.  I believe both Mr. Cronenberg and Mr. Pattinson should have been recognized for this movie<br /> and I think it's a shame they weren't.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I watch this show with my kids and talk about some of the moral dilemas.<br /><br />Superbly acted.  We Love It.
B003VANOFY|5.0|They are not a 500 dollar pair -<br /><br />But for the price i love them work great -<br /><br />The product is decent build has nice sound to them and wireless has worked flawlessly inside my house!<br />Recommend these to anyone and everyone looking for a decent set of headphones wireless and for a good price<br /><br />Love the feel of them, battery last a long time, microphone works great!<br /><br />I have had the headphones shut off and turn back on (very rare) and seem to be when there is no noise - there are times in movies they will shut on and off<br />From my experience with them it seems to be because it doesn't &#34;think&#34; there is sound, because if i walk away for an hour and come back they are off. (that is a nice feature to save battery life for sure) So i am assuming certain applications  arnt telling the headphones that there is something playing through them
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I waited a long time to finally read this series. I am a voracious reader and this just didn't seem like the type book I wanted to sink my imagination in to. But, to my surprise the characters were fairly well developed and I could see the actual draw they had to one another. I liked the fact that he stayed true to himself while he molded a bit for her. It made the story a bit more believable. The sex was ok. My favorite part was his wickedly charming wit. A surprising read, I must say.
B00A32CGY8|5.0|Let's face it - - this is not a &#34;feel good&#34; movie, unless you enjoy seeing people struggle just to survive. However, there is a thread of hope in the movie that tells you to hold on and never give up, no matter how bad the struggle becomes. It kind of reminds me of the NC State basketball coach Jim Valvano's speeches, when he knew that he was dying of cancer, in which he expressed gratitude for his life, and encouraged people to &#34;never, ever, give up&#34;. For most of the characters in the movie, they are all over the map with their behaviors, however the Mom is consistently a hopeful and optimistic influence, if only she can keep the family together and avoid &#34;becoming like the animals&#34;. In the end she comments that she'll never be afraid again, because she has endured through the scary times, and now she knows that they can deal with whatever comes.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|This is a great album, cd, tape, DL. Whatever. It ROCKS! This brings me back to Alice in Chains of old. Love it! I can't wait for the next one!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|I love it....I love it...I love it...and I love it again...since I have to write 5 more words, and I don't want to explain why I love it, I simply love it.
B00DBSZT7C|2.0|Very cheesy!  Interesting enough story set to heavy metal background music with a lot of cheesy lines and acting.  Wouldn't recommend.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Bloomberg is a more serious news network than other financial news networks.  Their app is also easy to use and comprehensive.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I loved this story. The author provides a wonderful story that is exciting, thoughtful, humorous and heartfelt. I am very glad I decided to try something different. Very pleased and will be reading more of this series.
1572816295|5.0|Really high quality cards with stunning illustrations. It comes with a nice little booklet to guide you through reading and each card and the set up.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its a fun game all but some of the mission and stuff are kind of confusing but it's a good game
B000KKPN5C|4.0|well - it's just automatic flash for point & shoot photography<br />worth money spent as it does the job perfectly well in A mode & useless for M mode.<br />absolutely tiny & comes with a nice little pouch.
1445830353|5.0|While I love the Sherlock Holmes short stories, I have always felt the long stories were greatly superior. Conan Doyle took the opportunity afforded by greater space and time to devise plots that allowed him to show his masterly skill for telling thrilling adventure stories to its best advantage.<br /><br />And for me, The Hound of the Baskervilles is the best of them all. It has everything: a dramatic setting, a family curse, an evil villain and best of all the terrifying and possibly supernatural hound itself. This is also the story that concentrates most on Watson, the human side of the partnership. We see his doggedness, his loyalty, his courage and, in this story more than the others, we also see his intelligence. It's just possible that I prefer Watson to Holmes...<br /><br />Derek Jacobi's reading is superb. I can't imagine anyone ever doing it better. His Watson is bluff and warm-hearted, his Holmes is incisive and each of the other characters is given a distinctive voice. Without spoiling the plot (because I so hope there are some lucky people out there who're coming to this story for the first time), when the book reaches its terrifying climax, the sheer horror that Jacobi gets into his voice deserves any acting accolades available. Spine-shivering, hair-raising, marvellous stuff - very highly recommended.<br /><br />NB This audio disc set was provided for review by Amazon Vine UK.
B00499QUK2|5.0|A great modernization of the classic.  This version is as good or better than any other Sherlock Holmes films.  Very well done.
034580404X|5.0|This was purchased for a gift.  The only way to purchase these book is in a trilogy.  I would purchase again
B001KWZ796|5.0|The actors are sublime the story is so wonderful it fills you with romance and true love.  And in the end love always wins!
0061726834|5.0|Favorite quotes: &#34;That's when you really lose people, you know. When the pain passes.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Hate isn't the most dangerous thing&#34; he'd said. Indifference is.&#34;<br /><br />Oh, where do I even begin. First of all, I'm kind of a snot because I bypassed this book a few times just based on it's cover. Some probably love it, but I'm not a fan of people's faces on the cover unless it's some angsty guy in a hoodie.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />1) The cover...already &#34;covered&#34; that.<br />2) Some of the love stuff bugged me at first because it was a little too romancy for me, but I also know that it was necessary since Lena was deprived of love and when she discovers it, she has to scream about it to the world, or at least inside her head...a lot.<br />That was about it...really.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />1) Everything else!<br /><br />Okay, let's get a little more specific. Oliver reminds me a little of Maggie (hold on a minute while I get up and get my copy of Shiver since I don't EVER know how to spell Maggie's last name)....okay, I'm back. Where was I now? Oh yeah, Oliver reminds me of Maggie Stiefvater because they are both amazing poets who know who to weave that into some amazing fiction.<br /><br />I saw on a thread somewhere someone was asking who the hottest heartthrob in books was? Where was Alex? He, by far, has got to be my favorite. I'll tell you why. He actually had a reason for loving Lena. He caught her at a moment where she was honest and it struck a chord in him. So much more refreshing than he just fell in love with her because she was beautiful or just because. On that note, Lena is not really described as beautiful and sometimes that will bother me because if I'm being honest...I like my heroine beautiful. It's why we read. We want to be transported for a while and be someone else and live one of a thousand different lives. This is the first time this didn't bother me because I didn't care if Lena was beautifulor not, I just felt like I knew her, and I suspect that she was beautiful in her own way anyway.<br /><br />Another thing I loved. She's a runner. I love it when authors do this because it is fun to read about and it's also showing that the main character is not afraid of pain and in another way, it's a way to show young adults that you can get high off something that is natural and actually good for you.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I watched Fringe when it was showing on Fox and found it exciting to see a show about pseudo science on a main television network.  Watched it all the way through to the end and enjoyed every last part.  Now that I am re-watching it on Amazon and in HD the same feeling of amazement is back and I'm noticing things that I missed the first time around.  I completely recommend this show to anyone interested in the weird, unexplained and strange world of fringe science. Its one hell of a ride.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|My grandkids like this game, and so do I when I get a chance to play it.  I let them play when they come to spend the night and it tires them out fast!
B009CF7JDU|2.0|I have been told this is a very funny movie...perhaps it is if you are brain dead or very bored.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I am a total TWIHARD..!!  I really love ECLIPSE.  This is a great DVD---- great extra's..!  I definitely recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Had weather channel app for almost two years used it daily and found it to be useful,informative and user friendly.Severe weather alerts were available for any location and radar maps easy to use.The app was free of ads pop ups and other annoying clutter.The new version for kindle is<br />useless,gives much less weather information and is not user friendly.  It is also full of ads and clutter.  The weather channel took what was a five star app and created an app deserving of ZERO stars. Either bring back the old  format or its on time to get weather somewhere else.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I thought this app was great before I updated it. I don't really like the way it is now. the way ir was before was simpler and cleaner this one is more complicated and I just didn't like it.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|I have a twitch account and I sometimes watch people livestream. This app runs videos smoothly and its nice quality, but its outdated. Other devices have this app updated with new features like chat and accessing your account, while on the Kindle Fire, you can only watch the livestream. Plus update the app. That would be awesome. :D
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was very impatiently waiting the release of this continuation. The wait was near unbearable, but I am pleased with what I read. The story was not lacking of interested, but it was a bit overloaded with plot. A lot of new twist were introduced, and I am still not sure what i think of everything that happened. Overall it was very enjoyable.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The title says it all. Yet another fantastic season with David Tennant as the tenth Doctor, with a sassy and intelligent companion, Donna Noble, played by Catherine Tate. Great chemistry, along with excellent story lines and the Doctor Who humor everyone loves. A must watch!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was using Google reader religiously and then found feedly. After one week I'm liking this even better. It's very easy to use with nice new features and accessibility across all platforms.
B00A17AD36|5.0|This Album is breathtaking. This Guy sings what ever is on his mind and I love that about him. Amazing!!!!!!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read &#34;A Wanted Man&#34; on an airplane and really loved the Jack Reacher character.  He's not inherently good or bad.  He knows the difference between right and wrong, as well as society's version, but makes his own decisions.  I love Tom Clancy and James Patterson, and Lee Child keeps up with both of them.  Not as detailed as Clancy, the book nevertheless was hard to put down.<br /><br />&#34;Killing Floor&#34; was a great followup for me.  I loved the fact that the character was just as fully developed as the much more recent &#34;A Wanted Man&#34;.  That meant I would be able to enjoy all the books without having to struggle through the author's trial and error character and plot development.  Or style, for that matter.  Very readable.  Just as hard to put down as my first Jack Reacher book.<br /><br />I like it when the bad guys get what they deserve, the good guys victories are earned and not pre-ordained, and I don't have to constantly suspend belief in an action thriller (too much, anyway).  I highly recommend this book.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Long and very well done.  Tells story of WW1 through the lives of many players.  Kept my interest over tome.  Can't wait to begin second book of the trilogy.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy touch tiles, clear concise tiles, one of t he best free apps I have downloaded. I spend many hours playing round after round. Recommend this app to all ages.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I simply love every book Khaled Hosseini has written.  This book is a bit different from the last two but it it splendid!
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Plot: (4 stars) The plot is incredibly simple: A New York couple become victims of the bad economy and wind up at a hippy group community. I think with the actual bad economy that we are facing, this plot actually works, especially if you have been thinking of alternative ways to live<br /><br />Cast: (5 stars) The best part about Wanderlust is the amazing cast. Every single character is unique, amazing, funny, and they all blend wonderfully as well. Justin Theroux is one of the best actors in the film, portraying the hippy group leader Seth. The rest of the cast is incredible as well, including Alan Alda!<br /><br />Re-watch-ability: (4.5 stars) I liked this movie so much, I ended up watching it like 3-4 times, and it was actually still very good the 4th time. The movie is chocked full of so many great scenes and lines, that I can't stop watching. When one great scene ends, another begins!<br /><br />If you love crazy comedies like \\"dumb and dumber\\", then I recommend this movie! It bombed at the box office, but I think future audiences will judge this movie favorably.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of only a few movies that my son and I both really enjoy watching.  It makes us both laugh out loud.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I bought this book because it was cheap, and I wasn't even planning on reading it. I started it one morning at work out of pure boredom. I couldn't stop reading it. It was so perfect. I actually ditched my plans that evening and stayed home to read. I refused to sleep until I finished. But the second I finished, I regretted my fast reading. I wanted the book to never end. I cried not only because of how it ended but simply because it ended.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I have read the books.  The Lord of the ring movies I thought were really good.  This movie was great.  Had heard a lot of negative remarks.  But I thought it was great.  A must see.  Cant wait till the next movie!!  I wish they started with this movie in the first place.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Slow start but after page 100 moves quickly.  Great story about how a mother shields her son from the outside world.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the movie was engagingly entertaining and masterfully executed. Isn't that what a movie should be? If the Hobbit is the sort of movie you think there's any chance you might enjoy, be it mildly or rabidly, you should watch it for the entertainment and marvel of it - in which case it won't matter how long it is, nor if you have to wait for 2 more movies to get to the end. Did you really want it to be over in one sitting? Don't look for something to complain about; sit back with the idea of enjoying it and you won't be disappointed.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This tale is a classic Dan Brown book! The twists and turns keep coming with every turn of the page.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I love his action movies.  Never liked him years ago for some reason.  But I really do like his acting in his later years.  The movie was really good.  If you like action movies.  The plot was a good one.  Nothing really new, but still kept me watching.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie, non stop comedy and action. Any fan of super hero movies will love this one! Fun for the whole family!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|It took me a while before I had the time to watch the movie.  I love MM so it was a must see.  It felt like they were trying to work the same angle they did in a Time to Kill but it ran short of that caliber.  They put a slight twist and attempted the same level of suspense but fell short of the previous mark.  It was still good and I am glad I watched it.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|It was good, not sure why they made this movie? This &#34;spin&#34; of the original movie doesn't come close to measuring up to &#34;the wizard of oz&#34; but it was a feel good movie, it was ok. Glad we saw it...
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son LOVES Minecraft, so this was the perfect gift.  The only drawback for most is the inflated price due to the popularity of Minecraft.
B0086DBE62|4.0|With a healthy dose of suspended disbelief, parents can join their kids in enjoying this light-hearted retelling -- with modern twists, naturally -- of the Snow White tale.
0679805273|5.0|Awesome product. Priced good and fast shipping. Gave as a gradution gift, great idea for any age. A gift filled with lots of life lessons.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I tried redeeming the code from the collection, but they aren't working. I tried through account management, and the Playstation Store. I also can't make an account for the Konami core website, which is something I also need to do in order to sign up with the loyalty program code that I got along with The Legacy Collection. (5 stars for the series, 0 stars for this problem that could have been avoided.)
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|This is an excellent series, one I'm very sorry to see end.  But the author gets the characters to where they need to be and one can imagine them going forward.  The suspence is excellent and his characters feel so real ... well, I don't want to give anything away.  Just go and read the book.  You won't be disappointed.  But you will wish there was more to come because you'll miss these characters when the series is done.
B002O2THVA|5.0|Two of The Great old school Actors of The Silver Screen, Great Plot That Twist & Turns ! Great For any Western Movie Fan !
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|Awesome product. Priced good and fast shipping. Something fun to put on your desk. Great gift idea for any age.<br />Always fun to have something to play with.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I feel like I only got half a book. Too much sex, not enough plot movement. I was disappointed to have the book end, it didn't feel like a complete story, reminded me of the 200 page $0.99 books on amazon.
B005H9B44A|5.0|If you like folk stories and beliefs you will love Thor.  Thor, son of Odin All Father, guardian of the universe.  This is a great story of youthful hubris, lies and deceit, gaining wisdom, sacrifice and forgiveness and mixed into a lot of amazing special effects, monsters and battles.
B005HED11Y|4.0|I just love the original Star Trek and the Next Generation. Nice for a weekend marathon with family or friends.
0440246318|5.0|Never a dull moment in this series.  Lee Child is my favorite author. I am so glad the woman at my local bookstore got me  reading these great stories!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the saga of Gideon & Eva. The book had a little too much recapping but I still can't wait to see what the future holds for this couple.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is amazing how easily you get drawn into the lives of the people of Downton Abbey.  You'll have your favorites and you'll have the ones you would like to kick, but you will always have an opinion.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Jacob sets out on a journey to hopefully connect with his grandfather. What he finds and learns about himself is quite peculiar. This book is filled with surprising twists and unpredictable events. I'm looking forward to reading Hollow City to find out how the adventure continues for Jacob.
1577314808|5.0|In the world today the information never stops; Facebook, texts, tweets, e-mails, and on and on. This simple book has a powerful message; just stop and focus on the here and 'Now.' Just focus on being here right now...just turn it off. Very simple, yet very powerful. Highly recommended for anyone interested in spiritual development, or is just stressed and needs a break!
159463176X|5.0|I cannot quite express how deeply I feel for the characters in this story.  I admit, at first I was a bit confused by the changing timeline, but things always came together full circle quickly.  there's something outstandingly beautiful about these lives in tragedy and acceptance.  This comes together in a way I can only describe as eloquent.<br /><br />If you are looking for fast-paced-action, this isn't it... but it's such a fast read and difficult to put down.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I wasn't expecting much of this movie, but it has some twists and turns that surprised me and by the end I was cheering ofr the &#34;slimey lawyer&#34; that I disliked at the beginning.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|was great until the update now volume is very low when kindle volume is at the highest. never do updates they always make it worse
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Download app for free to my kindle.  I havn't used it much, but the few times I have I like it.
0307455874|4.0|The book was very informational and informative I look forward to more books on our President that you will be offering soon.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|This is a great DVD of a historic concert by a legendary rock band! The DVD audio/video is excellent and the \\"Boys\\" sounded better than ever. It's a Beach Boys' fan dream-come-true to watch David Marks, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love & Brian Wilson together again singing a great line up of songs. The band behind them is very, VERY good! It is definitely \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" for the whole family!
B002J2PB10|5.0|Such a kick ass movie, I can't wait to see it again. Like tonight. Or right now. SEE IT ALREADY!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great product and it was free....  Use it in the dark and I don't have to turn on the lights. Installed on my kindle.
0307383415|5.0|This book was great and I know that there will be more offered in the near future on this President Obama.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Samuel Jackson played Samuel Jackson in a western<br />it was like Jar Jar Bigs in Star Wars. Kind of cheesed out<br />what other wise was a great movie.
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|Whenever I heard that Fall Out Boy was making A new CD, I was falling all over myself just to get an order placed for it. I've always been a pretty big fan, and liked all their previous material. Not to say I don't like this album, but its just not as good as the older material. I liked about 6 of The songs out of the whole thing. So on scale of 1-10, I'd give a 7.
B00CISAPJS|5.0|Loved the special effect's story was good did not need the swearing,wasn't alot but enough if you have kids.deff  enjoyable
