B000MR9D5E|5.0|The newest nature series from David Attenborough is almost on a par with the legendary \\"Life on Earth\\" series (available in Great Britain).  Cutting-edge camera technology and unbelievable perseverance are this series hallmarks.  Don't miss the snow leopards, the Amur leopards or the lion pride taking down an immature elephant, at night!  The only quibble is that the sound track sometimes drowns out Mr. Attenborough's commentary on disc one.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|When I read the playlist for Michael Bubl&eacute;'s newest cd \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" and saw that he was covering \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\"; I knew I had to have the cd.  I have enjoyed all of Bubl&eacute;'s recordings and I was very excited thinking of his crooning style covering that song.  I was not disappointed at all - it's a soulfull rendition of a 70's classic.  However, that's only one track and all 13 tracks are splendid.  From the Sinatra-like stylings of \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" to the funky duet with Boyz II Men on \\"Comin' Home Baby\\"; this cd is one delight after another.  My personal favorite is \\"I've Got The World On A String\\" where Bubl&eacute; and band swing it hard.  The recording is a delight and rounds out any Bubl&eacute;, Rat Pack or swing collection.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|Many visiting Amazon will remember the film THE COMMITMENTS telling the story of an Irish soul band specializing in many of the Stax classics of the sixties.  Though most of the attention was focused on the rotund lead singer, the guitarist Outspan Foster was played by a veteran 21-year-old busker by the name of Glen Hansard.  He played, in fact, one of the two first members of the band, since he and the band's keyboardist asked Jimmy Rabbitte to help them form a band (though they would dispense of their tentative name, And And And, though they were also considering And And! And).  Though no one at the time would have guessed it, it was Hansard more than any other member of the fictional band (though it did tour as a real band in the wake of the movie's success) who would achieve musical success.  About the same time that filming for the Commitments began, Hansard had formed a band, the Frames, that would over the course of the next seventeen years develop a reputation for being one of the best live bands in the world and though their recorded output never quite matched the extraordinary live performances they would release several superb albums.  Two of the Frames' albums--FITZCARRALDO and THE COST--would be nothing short of masterpieces.  One of the original members of the Frames was John Carney.  To complete the background story, Carney met the young Czech singer Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; while visiting Prague and she later provided some vocals for his 2006 solo album THE SWELL SEASON.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure whose idea it was to make a movie, but former-Frame Carney and Hansard, with the help of our young Czech heroine, came up with the idea to make a movie based on Carney and Hansard's experiences in Dublin.  Though the Frames are not well known in the United States, there are many who regard them and not U2 as the great Irish band.  Those seeing this movie are not going to have a great deal of difficulty believing that.  Hansard is one of the world's great frontmen, singing with a white-hot intensity remarkably emotional and passionate songs.  For those unfamiliar with his work, he will have seemed to drop out of the sky like a meteor.  They will have trouble believing someone this talented is not already a household name.<br /><br />The songs for the movie are culled from a number of places.  The absolutely extraordinary \\"Say It To Me,\\" one of Hansard's greatest songs, comes from the great 1996 Frames' album FITZCARRALDO, \\"Lies\\" and \\"Falling Slowly\\" come from Hansard's solo album THE SWELL SEASON (on which Irglov&aacute; also sings), and \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\" is one of the best songs off this year's amazing new Frames' album THE COST.  Regardless of the source, the songs here are amazingly well performed, more acoustic than in their original versions.  I know some audience members for the film are blown away by the music and I think part of the reason is that they don't realize that these songs represent highlights from a large and exceedingly great body of work.  Even so, the great news is that Hansard has written far more great music than appears on this album.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this disc for people who saw the movie and loved the music (and hey, what's not to adore?).  This is simply gorgeous stuff and anyone who isn't moved by it probably is never moved by great music.  So the album can act as a terminus, but it should also act as a door to the rest of Hansard's work.  The two albums I would most recommend are the two I mentioned above, FITZCARRALDO and THE COST.  These are filled with great songs, all songs magnificently by Hansard, who also wrote them.  If those don't exhaust your interest you could also look at BURN THE MAPS as well as the aforementioned solo album THE SWELL SEASON.  And as fine as this soundtrack is, the two main Frames albums I mentioned are each even better.ging with a white-hot intensity remarkably emotional and passionate songs.

B000CPGZHA|5.0|What I love about Kylue, even moreso than Madonna, is that Kylie embraces her bubbly pop past and seems to revel in the campiness and silliness of pop music, whereas other artists like Madonna and others seem concerned about legitimacy and being taken seriously.  For instance, in almost every one of her tours, Kylie sticks with her classic SAW hits like \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" and \\"The Locomotion\\" (among others).  While she often reinterprets them to keep them fresh (in this case, \\"The Locomotion\\" is performed in a slow, sexy striptease number) what I really love is that in this show, the musical arrangements of \\"I Should Be So Lucky,\\" \\"Hand On Your Heart,\\" \\"Better The Devil You Know\\" etc. are basically the original studio versions.  But the remixs are cool too.  In this show, she mashes \\"Spinning Around\\" with CeCe Peniston's classic club hit \\"Finally\\" to great result. <br /> <br />If I have one minor quibble, it's that I purchased this DVD along with the \\"Showgirl: Homecoming\\" double live CDs, only torealize afterward that they are two different shows.  (The DVD was recorded in London and the CDs in Sydney.)  As such, there are some songs on the DVD that aren't on the CD and vice versa.  I know, silly complaint, but I wish all the songs were on both.  What can I say, I can never get enough Kylie!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Very nice program and a wonderful documentary series. <br />It took Five years and included a $25 million budget. <br />Easily the best spent $25 million in history of television. <br />  <br />Thank god when this program was ready, the technology had caught up so we can enjoy this wonderful experience in our homes. <br />
0140277447|4.0|Chang's account has inspired a 2007 expensive and carefully-marketed documentary film of the same title, and that is the book's chief value--as an awareness-raising event that exposes our frequently \\"selective\\" focus on incidents of man's inhumanity to man (Rwanda being one such incident of selective amnesia).  The book is an essential artifact, and Chang should be applauded for her conscientiousness, diligence, and courage in producing what has already proven to be a seminal work, producing ground-shaking tremors throughout the international community.<br /><br />For many, if not most, readers, the Introduction and Epilogue will most likely prove sufficient to convey the author's intended purpose and effect.  Those who take pleasure in marking the historical circumstances of war and its aftermath, along with reading graphic descriptions of sensational, specific incidents of torture, etc.), will no doubt wish to read the entire account.  For others the aforementioned two sections, an account such as the one on Wikipedia, and the two-part video on Youtube, \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" (ignore the transparently weak rebuttals), should be sufficient.<br /><br />Some readers will appreciate Chang's simplification of the atrocity and the reasons for it.  She issues a disclaimer in the Introduction that \\"Japan bashing\\" is the farthest thing from her mind, but the ensuing account is one that paints the Japanese--from the ancient Samurai/Bushido code to the 20th-century expansionist mentality to the deification of the emperor to the robotic school system to the cruel and inhuman training of its own military youth to the enforced slavery of \\"comfort women\\" to Japan's continual and continuing denial of the past--in broad, culturally incriminating, stereotyping strokes.  A reader, therefore, needs to exercise some counterbalancing skepticism--for example, toward the account of the Samurai, who represented an ideal, much like the knights of Camelot or the radical individualists of the American frontier, from which modern Japan deviated rather than suffered.  Also, it has been shown that the \\"comfort women\\" were also supplied, following World War II, to thousands of American troops, and with the cooperation of the American post-War military command.<br /><br />In answering the all-important question of \\"why,\\" Chang is quite convincing with her limited, though largely undeveloped, list of reasons--ranging from \\"transference of oppression\\" (what we might refer to as the \\"wife-battering syndrome\\") to the herd mentality of losers suddenly cast in the role of conquerors to an entire culture's utter conviction of following a divine imperative in the best interests of China as well as Japan.  Chang hits hardest on the genocide that occurs because nations who should know better (the U.S., for example) are content to remain disengaged from whatever doesn't affect them directly.  But her most compelling reason, to my mind, is cultural-racial pride, a theme that during the American Civil War produced suffering and death exceeding by far anything that occurred at Nanking.<br /><br />Chang even suggests that because the Japanese and Chinese were so similar in skin color and physical appearance, the racial antagonism was intensified.  Not possessing the verifiable demarcation of lighter or darker skin color, the Japanese were all the more zealous to proclaim their superiority.  So again and again we're brought back to the deadliest sin of all--from Greek tragedy to Biblical writings to Faulkner's accounts of the tragic fall of the Old South: hubris, arrogance, or just plain pride, which unfortunately is exclusive to no individual human being or nation.<br /><br />By now, you'd think we'd begin to get the message.

B0009MWAVQ|5.0|I've been a Scarlatti fan since I discovered the Ralph Kirkpatrick recordings on Columbia when I was in high school--some 40 years ago. Over the years I have played some of them on the piano and collected numerous recordings, performed on both harpsichord and piano.  I first purchased Scott Ross's complete collection after sampling the 3-CD Scarlatti Anthologie and being pleased with what I heard.  After listening to about a third of the 34 CDs on which the 555 sonatas are recorded I can say that Scott Ross's performances equal or exceed anything I've heard from any other performer on harpsichord. There are recordings by other performers I rate very highly--Wanda Landowska's characterful pre-WW II recordings and Andras Schiff's superb piano recordings of the sonatas come to mind--but Scott Ross has it all. Meticulous accuracy, a truly engaging sense of rhythm--so critical in bringing out the character of the sonatas, a superb sense of the Spanish idiom Scarlatti uses, elegant ornamentaion, a masterful selection of stops, and the wonderful recorded harpsichord sound all make this set a thoroughly satisfying musical experience for the Scarlatti lover. Bringing all of this quality to the formidable task of recording all of Scarlatti's 555 sonatas is a tremendous achievement and a true service to the music loving public. In addition to the pleasure of having such a treasure trove of great Scarlatti performances, the complete collection has afforded me the oppotunity to discover many  elegant gems among Scarlatt's lesser known sonatas--the kind that stay in my head days after hearing them.  That Ross died at the relatively early age of 38 was a real loss. If you're a Scarlatti fan, treat yourself to this complete collection. You won't be disappointed.

B000007492|3.0|I orderered the Very Best of Supertramp after debating between Breakfast in America (which I once owned on LP) and the former.  I liked the cuts from Breakfast in America the best.  I do love this group, though, they are eclectic and they have a very unique sound.
B00005JPFO|4.0|Being a long time fan of Ghost Rider I was very skeptic about this film. I've always enjoyed Nick Cage's movies but doubted him as Johnny Blaze. I still feel Ryan Reynolds would've been an ideal choice but that's just me. Mr. Cage pulls the character off albeit he just doesn't fit the role. I did enjoy the CGI and the storyline was much better then I expected. Overall I liked this film and would recommend to new and old fans alike.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|Let me start off by saying Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors.  From Alien, to Blade Runner, to Gladiator he has a good range of high quality work that appeals to many.  It's no doubt he is on the list of favorite directors for several film buffs, and Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut should be one of those reasons. KoH got a bad rap from the theatre version which was due to crucial scenes being left out for a shorter running time.  The Director's Cut fixes this issue by adding in the scenes that help the film's story.   One big complaint I've read about the DVD version of the Director's Cut is that it's annoying and breaks the immersion to have to SWAP DISCS.  Yes, it's so long that there isn't enough room to fit on a small DVD disc.  Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut on Blu-ray fixes this.  A Blu-ray disc can hold five times more than a standard DVD which allows the studio to put longer movies and more features with better sound on one disc!  This is very true for this title, it looks wonderful.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I accidentally tuned into PBS one night while they were airing this concert.  I was mesmerized and could not wait to get my own DVD of it.  This group - Celtic Woman - brings depth, feeling and creativity to the stage in their presentation of this music. <br /> <br />Lovely to look at; wonderful to hear, Celtic Woman is a group worth seeing and I'm pleased to be able to say that my wife and I just saw them live and couldn't have been more pleased.  If you cannot get to one of their concerts, owning this DVD is the next best thing.  If you CAN get to one of their concerts, you'll want to own the DVD as a reminder of how good the live concert was.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Casino Royale raises the bar for modern Bond films.  I must admit, I was a bit disturbed upon hearing Daniel Craig would play the role of Bond.  He was blonde (we had never had a blonde bond before) and didn't really seem to fit the part based on previous works of his that I had seen.  Now after seeing the film, I can safely say he was a great choice and my fears were not necessary.  The film is full of great characters, exotic locations, and everything else that makes a true 007 film.<br />Buying this film on Blu-ray should be a no-brainer considering you have a Blu-ray player.  Myself, I have a Playstation 3 console which according to reviews on the internet and in magazines is the best Blu-ray player on the market.  It played Casino Royale beautifully on my HDTV in 720p and 1080i.  The scenes are full of detail, I even paused the movie on a scene that had a large crowd.  You could make out all of the faces and every detail about them.  You can't see that kind of detail on DVD!  Bond fans must buy this!

B000NDIAWY|5.0|This album was recorded live to tape. In other words, Brandi sung, T. Bone recorded.  No fancy computers were used, no overdubbing, no artificial enhancements.  What you get on this album is the same sound you get when Brandi plays live. <br /> <br />The result is a very real, very emotional record. At times Brandi's voice cracks, but this only enhances the emotion. <br /> <br />When I first heard the record, I was surprised by this. I expected extra over-dubbing and an attempt to create at least one pop hit. I thought, this is good stuff, but no way will it be popular. I was wrong. I am so glad I was wrong! Music Buyers are clearly yearning for something real. <br /> <br />For those who complain about the \\"twang\\" and \\"country\\" sounds in this record, get over it. Pull out a Bob Dylan album and you'll hear the same thing. This sound is what American Rock & Roll is all about. I saw Brandi perform Live recently, and her performances of songs from her first album had the same feel as the songs on the new record. This sound is genuine, real, and wonderful! <br /> <br />In short: Don't buy this CD because of the Indigo Girls backing vocals on Cannon Ball. Don't buy this CD if you want a vapid pop album. Don't buy this CD if you just want something pretty (not that there's anything wrong with pretty). Buy this CD to enjoy real rock music, performed by an extremely talented young woman, with a great band. <br /> <br />By-the-way: This record is even better on vinyl. <br />
B00005JMEW|4.0|Opening with 1970's style 'Our Feature Presentation' and then you are straight into a roller coaster of a film. Yes it is violent, and there is a lot of blood. But its very well done and of course a homage to the films that Tarantino grew up with in the 60's and 70's. Spagetti westerns, Kung-Fu movies are all referenced in images and the soundtrack. Spot Sonny Shiba as the greatest sword maker ever.<br /><br />A third of the way through the film we get an anime section as well. Tarantino may be a fan of anime, but watching this sequence again recently I realised how incredibly violent it is. The whole film is an adult comic strip anyway, but this section is so violent that maybe Tarantino just decided to do it animated to avoid censorship problems. Whatever it doesn't matter, it works.<br /><br />This is, as you would expect, well directed and fantastic entertainment. The performances from the cast are all good or better.<br /><br />BTW there is really no point in buying this DVD without buying vol 2 at the same time. The reason it only gets 4 stars? Kill Bill vol2 is better.
0385340559|5.0|How wonderful life can be: a new Jack Reacher novel, a long night of reading and, by sheer coincidence, a tremendous thunderstorm. Perfect for reading about the adventures of Reacher.<br /><br />  And what adventures these are. Reacher reunited with his old military police outfit. Well, sort of: one of the eight has already turned up dead - tossed from a helicopter - and three others are missing. Now there are three plus Reacher living up to their old unit motto: \\"Don't mess with the investigators\\".<br /><br />  This is a different Jack Reacher: he maims and murders so few people that you might mistake him for a pacifist. But don't worry: Reacher isn't turning into a wimpified John Rain, Barry Eisler's  once glorious intellectual assasin. Reacher is still very much Reacher.<br /><br />  Reacher, if you didn't know, is classic anti-hero. Once a major in an elite U. S. Army military police unit, Reacher has become a drifter who doesn't seek out violence, but always unerringly manages to get knee-deep in other's people's blood that he is usually shedding. Reacher has no home, His possessions were formerly limited to a folding toothbrush. Now, post 9/11, Reacher has added an ATM card. Interesting, author Lee Child simply ignores the fact that banks require some form of ID to open any account. Reacher, of course, has no ID. Jack Reacher is an urban John Rambo. Smarter by far, but essentially a killing machine if you cross him, his friends or some innocent stranger. Reacher doesn't see grays: he sees black and white - you are either with him or against him.<br /><br />  The ATM card plays a clever role in setting up this story. Reacher is in Portland OR and about to go somewhere. He doesn't know where yet because Reacher doesn't plan that way. He goes to the bus terminal and buys a ticket on the first bus he sees. He needs cash for the ticket, goes to the ATM and sees that a deposit has been made. Reacher, it turns out in this 11th installment in the series, has a never before mentioned facility with mathematics, another convenient invention for this story. He see patterns in numbers and in this one he sees a radio code for officer needs help. Reacher deduces that it is one of his old unit buddies seeking him out.<br /><br />  Soon we are introduced to three of Reacher's old command. Of the remaining four, one is known dead and three are missing.<br /><br />  Normally a Jack Reacher book is short on mystery (which is fine) and long on violence. This time, the book is long on mystery and relatively short on violence (though there is plenty, the body count is low for a Reacher book). Why was their old buddy tortured and murdered? What has happened to other old comrades who have gone missing?<br /><br />  Reacher and his three veterans start digging and begin to unravel a mystery that could have awful consequences for the United States.<br /><br />  Lee Child took a gamble here, thinking that he could get away with making Jack Reacher, the solo mayhem generator, into not only a team player, but leader of the team. he gets away with it. Reacher, for a while at least, is indeed a team player, sending its members off on one mission or another to get the job done. Just like the old days when Reacher and friends were in the \\"green machine\\", the Army.<br /><br />  The story is solid. Child doesn't disappoint. Reacher is not his usual murderous self, though there is no shortage of newly made corpses. Reacher is still the same cynical loner he's always been, though Child does provide us a glimpse of Reacher as a leader which is indeed a different Reacher.<br /><br />  Save this one for a day or night when you have lots of time because you'll want to read it one sitting. And, if you have the luck to pick a night with a loud and violent thunderstorm, so much the better. Perfect accompaniment for this newest installment in the life of Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Jerrya never before mentioned facility with mathematics, another convenient invention for this story.

B00005JMUA|5.0|You've seen vol 1 and thought do I really want to sit through another 2 hours of swords and kung-fu? Well vol 2 is the much better film, so the answer is yes.<br /><br />Curiously enough although Vol 2 is longer, it seems to have a tighter construction. Some of the chapters are breath-taking, perhaps because they are shorter. The Pai-Mei chapter is simply marvellous. Uma Thurman gets her training with Pai Mei and Bill tells her \\"remember no sarcasm, no back-talk at least not for the first year or so, gonna have to let him warm up to you\\"! The Pai Mei chapter ties a lot of things together as well.<br /><br />Oh yes in vol 2 we get to see Bill for the first time. David Carradine is great, very cool, and occasionally seems to become Kwai Chang Caine again all these years later.<br /><br />I'd recommend seeing Vol 1 first, although it isn't quite as essential to do this, as it is to watch vol 2 after watching vol 1.<br /><br />This is fabulous entertainment made by a master film-maker and I strongly recommend it.

I always end up watching this movie when it's playing on TV, so I'm just going to go buy it. I don't believe in destiny and the whole made-for-each-other bit, but when I watch this movie, for a couple of hours and the rest of the day, I'm a believer.

B000I2MRHE|5.0|I read about this product in a parenting magazine and immediately decided to purchase it.  I looked on several web sites and read many reviews before coming to Amazon to buy.  This is one of the top 3 purchases I've made for my child!!!  Before this little item came along my daughter would scream in frustration during tummy time and become almost inconsolable if we tried it for more than 2 minutes.  I did every conceivable thing to make tummy time better for her with no luck.  The moment I put her on the spinner she was interested and alert, NO CRYING!  Naturally we started slowly with 5 minute intervals and have been working our time up but the fact that there are no more tears of frustration makes this thing worth it's weight in gold.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|Steven Spielberg took a lot of flack for \\"Munich,\\" which he admits is neither pro-Israeli nor pro-Palestinian.  From Spielberg, I suppose many expected - or wanted - something more ardently Zionist.  But Spielberg cast the die when he decided on George Jonas' [[ASIN:0743291646 Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team]] as his source material.  Vengeance's point of view - and its tortuous history - is predicated on the moral ambivalence of 'Avner,' the pseudonym of the team leader, as played on-screen here by an excellent Eric Bana.  I read \\"Vengeance\\" a couple of months prior to seeing the film, and my feeling is that Spielberg accurately captured Avner's feelings as well as his metamorphosis.  The one thing that got left out was Avner's complex relationship with his Dad, who - in the book - essentially foretells Avner's denouement at the outset.<br /><br />Jonas' book is controversial.  There are ongoing disputes over its inherent accuracy to the point where people doubt the essence of the story  or whether an 'Avner' actually existed.  In the most recent release - coinciding with the film - Richard Ben Cramer writes a nice new introduction with a pithy comment that the debate has evolved to the point where the essence of the argument is people now saying \\"Hey, my part in the movie wasn't big enough.\\"<br /><br />There are some nice surprises in the film including a pre-Bond breakout appearance by Daniel Craig as part of Avner's team, as well as appearances by first-rate Israeli Arab actors Makram Khoury and Hiam Abbass.  It goes without saying that their roles here are all too brief (it belabors the point to mention why).  I suggest you see [[ASIN:B000EHQ7JC The Syrian Bride]] to see these two talented professionals in top form.  There's also the inclusion of a way-inside joke of encountering future Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak - dressed in very unconvincing drag - prior to a raid in Lebanon.

B000A6T1JU|4.0|I am a long time fan of the movie and from a rather young age I thought it was gritty and very striking. I was about 10 when I first saw the movie and I thought it was told rather well.I wasn't really looking for the movie when I came across the sale for it it brought back a lot of memories. I think as I'm sure most do the bottle rattling was probably the most telling part of the movie and the most memorable scene. In the new cut I really liked the new layout like a comic it was a new twist on the transitions The begining dialog would have made more sense had he Drawn more relevance to the warrior gang than he did.I do think this is a good version of the film and I would recomend it for those that were fans of the original cut.

B000002AGM|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this. Recorded in 1957, this suite of ten songs (with four bonus tracks) has Miles Davis playing the much mellower sounding flugelhorn with spellbinding orchestration by Gil Evans. I was amazed to realise that the 19-piece orchestra in question is made up of horns only. Even Wynton Kelly's piano can only be heard on take 7 of the remake of \\"Springsville\\", one of the bonus tracks. There's not a violin or cello in sight but the sound is still full, lush and warm. It's incredible fun to listen to.<br /><br />This was the first of four Columbia collaborations between Davis and Evans. I already have another - the excellent [[ASIN:B000002AH7 Sketches of Spain]] - but can't wait to find out what the other two are and get my hands on them. Davis' lyricsm and attention to detail almost literally jumps out of the speakers.<br /><br />Listened to as a suite, (a continuous blend of ten independent but related pieces of music, I'm told, in the very informative and comprehensive inner-sleeve notes), this is one beautiful body of work but I can still pick out a few favourite parts: \\"Springsville\\" (both versions), \\"The Maids of Cadiz\\", \\"My Ship\\", \\"Miles Ahead\\", \\"Blues for Pablo\\", \\"New Rhumba\\" (that tune makes me beam from ear to ear every time I hear it. I'd rhumba but I don't know how) and \\"Lament\\".<br /><br />Another Miles Davis masterpiece, no question.

B000P2A256|4.0|The first thing that occurs to me listening to this CD is how quickly it ends once it's begun. Even with two bonus tracks, the whole experience is over in 48mins and 29 secs. That's not so good. Where's value for money, I ask?<br /><br />The second thing is the definite retro feel to the music. It's modern pop rock but I'm hearing a clear reference to the 80s and early 90s. That's a definite plus with me. For me, that's value for money right there.<br /><br />Then there's Adam Levine's voice. Someone described it to me as soulful recently but I'm not so sure about that. I can think of a couple of wonderful words and phrases to describe his voice from my point of view though: unusual, unique, unmistakable, distinctive, and immediately recognisable. But soulful? I'm not so sure.<br /><br />Then there are the songs. The first couple, including the current single, don't really do anything for me. They're too busy, too overproduced, in my opinion and Levine's voice is smothered. I found them instantly forgettable.<br /><br />It's not until \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\", a crisp pop tune with a thumping bass line that reminds me of The Police's \\"Every Breath You Take\\" - and I mean that in a nice way - that the CD really gets interesting for me. On \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\", Levine takes back the refrain he loaned to Kanye West for \\"Heard 'Em Say\\", my favourite tune from his last CD [[ASIN:B0009WPKY0 Late Registration]]. No surprise then that it's also one of my favourites on this CD. \\"Can't Stop\\" is a funky, jumpy, foot-tapping, head nodder of a number and another one that makes me wonder how much these guys were influenced by Sting and his 1980s cohorts in making this album. I'm sure I hear echoes of Prince too.<br /><br />Another tune shaping up to be a favourite on this album is \\"Goodnight Goodnight\\", an apologetic, mid-tempo, guitar driven song about love lost with some very interesting lyrics. It opens with: \\"You left me hanging from the thread we once swung from together/ I've licked my wounds but I can't ever see them getting better. Something's gotta change/ Things cannot stay the same...\\". I hear that.<br /><br />Then it's back to thumping beats and booming bass lines for \\"Not Falling Apart\\". Things get real crazy with \\"Kiwi\\", a frenetic rock hymn that has hit single written all over it.<br /><br />The ballad \\"Better We Break\\" starts off with just Levine's plaintive vocals and a guitar riff. The bass and drums kick in for the second verse and off we go. It's a truly beautiful song that speaks of the pain of the realisation that one is probably better off apart from a loved one. Been there too.<br /><br />Another ballad, \\"Back At Your Door\\" follows on neatly and officially closes the album. Of the bonus tracks, \\"Until You're Over Me\\" is my preferred, though \\"Infatuation\\" is still a very interesting tune.<br /><br />All in all, a very solid follow-up. I'm finding it really difficult to decide whether I like this one more than [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]], though I guess it's clear from the review that I identify closely with the songs that talk about the pain of love lost, which would seem to be the overall theme of the album. What does seem clear to me though is that this one might not generate as many successful singles and as a result, sell as many copies. But I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<br /><br />Props to Mike Elizondo and Mike Spike Stent for the great production though. They co-produced the vast majority of the songs with the band, save for \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" & \\"Back At Your Door\\" (Mark Endert & Maroon 5) and \\"Little Of Your Time\\" (Eric Valentine & Maroon 5).om together/ I've licked my wounds but I can't ever see them getting better.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|I always know what I'm going to get with a Michael Bubl&eacute; CD. He's found a formula that works, he's sticking with it and God bless him. Reunited with David Foster and Humberto Gatica, the producers that have turned his rich timbre and sensitive phrasing into pure gold so far, he's back with a set that will please and reassure established fans and, hopefully, draw in new ones. It only took one listen to please and reassure me. It's a dazzling collection of tunes.<br /><br />The producers certainly know what they're doing. One of the more interesting things about this CD is the diversity of orchestration arrangements: The optimistic opener \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\", for instance, is arranged by John Clayton and backed by the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra but that's the only tune they work on. Strings and horns on the rest of the CD are arranged by David Foster and Jerry Hey, (\\"It Had Better Be Tonight (Meglio Stasera)\\" & \\"Comin' Home Baby\\"), David Foster and Bill Ross, (\\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\" & \\"Always On My Mind\\"), David Foster and Don Sebesky, (\\"I'm Your Man\\") David Foster and Alan Chang, (\\"Lost\\"), Jorge Calandrelli, (\\"Wonderful Tonight\\") Don Sebesky, David Foster and Michael Bubl&eacute;, (\\"I've Got The World On A String\\") and Take 6 and movie score man, Mervyn Warren (\\"That's Life\\").<br /><br />Usually with a Bubl&eacute; CD there's always one song that leaps out and stays with me. With [[ASIN:B000088E6D Michael BublÃ©]] for instance, it was \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\". On [[ASIN:B00070Q7VO It's Time]], it was his beautiful (and surprising) duet with Nelly Furtado, \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\". Don't get me wrong; I love all the songs on both albums but there's always one that's that little bit extra special.<br /><br />With this set, the choice is a bit more difficult. There are a number of contenders, so many good songs choose from: I particularly like the samba beats of \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" and Bubl&eacute; sounds like he's having just as much fun with the song as it is listening to it. His version of \\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\" is also very interesting. I wasn't expecting him to do a cabaret or karaoke version in a misguided attempt to match or beat the Billy Paul original and he hasn't. (I'd have been very disappointed if he had). He's smoothed it out and, in the context of the overall album and what I've come to know Bubl&eacute; for, it fits in very nicely. Emily Blunt's ad-lib background vocals towards the end add a touch that's simply divine.<br /><br />A definite personal highlight though, is Bubl&eacute;'s version of \\"Comin' Home Baby\\". It's billed as a duet with Boyz II Men but it's more like 'featuring Boyz II Men', as all they do is provide background vocals and some ad-libs (albeit very exciting background vocals and ad-libs). The song makes me wonder what happened to those dudes and makes me hope that we haven't heard the last of them.<br /><br />His duet with Ivan Lins, the Eric Clapton song \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" is also a song to look out for. It comes complete with a beautiful guitar solo by Heitor Pereira.<br /><br />And then there's \\"Everything\\", which is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard - and I've heard quite a few. It's sure to make even the most hardened cynic's heart smile. Mine was.<br /><br />The only version of \\"Always On My Mind\\" I'd heard prior to Bubl&eacute;'s was the dance version by Pet Shop Boys, a version I remember being quite popular in the clubs in the late 80s or early 90s. Hearing it as a ballad, I finally fully appreciate the song's meaning. Funny that.<br /><br />\\"That's Life\\" is given a totally invigorating boost by a choir led and conducted by Mervyn Warren. The choir includes the likes of Seidah Garrett, Carmen Carter and Lisa Vaughn - who also provide additional vocals at the beginning of the song.<br /><br />And finally, there's \\"Dream\\". I absolutely adore this song courtesy of Ella Fitzgerald's version on her [[ASIN:B0000047G2 Sings the Johnny Mercer Songbook]] album. Bubl&eacute;'s version is not as good as hers - and really, I don't think anyone could possibly beat Ella - but it's still a joy to listen to and an excellent way to round up the album.<br /><br />Like I said at the top, I know what to expect from Bubl&eacute;. I don't expect pop star screams, urban beats, raps or soulful growls. He's an easy listening singer and a very accomplished one. He still has some way to go to match the likes of Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennett in my view but he's still very young. Harry Connick, Jr was in the game long before he was and I already like him much more. As such, some of the reviews he's received here (in the \\"yawn\\" and \\"zzzzz\\" category) are not just rather harsh and totally unjustified in my opinion; they also show a complete lack of appreciation for what the man is all about.<br /><br />But maybe I'm just biased.on is not as good as hers - and really, I don't think anyone could possibly beat Ella - but it's still a joy to listen to and an excellent way to round up the album. <br /> <br />Like I said at the top, I know what to expect from Bublé.

0553579908|4.0|I don't typically read fantasy, which is not to say that I'm not a fan, just not a particularly passionate one.  But I enjoyed A Clash of Kings, and I'll be picking up the next installment pretty soon.<br /><br />Book 1 surprised me and kept me hooked because no one seemed safe.  Several characters who it appeared would be hanging around for some time to come were killed off, and that along with the frankness about sex, the realism of a quasi-medieval life and the interesting twists and turns of the plot was more than enough to keep me reading to the last page.<br /><br />Much of that remains in Book 2, A Clash of Kings, but for me the sequel was even more of a success in the way that it builds to a confrontation during the last 200 pages that had me riveted...it was one of those 'can't put it down' nights for me that readers love so much.  I just couldn't stand the wait until the next day to find out what happens.<br /><br />So, my hat's off to the author for another rewarding reading experience.  Thanks!
B00005JPO8|2.0|I found the plot corny and unexceptional. Eyeball rolling moments include the cliched accident in the road and the Stasi guy listening to the music. Didn't believe his character or much else. It is sentimental melodramatic claptrap designed to push buttons in people to produce waterworks, rather than serious thinking. On the plus side there is some nice period detail (although I have no idea how accurate) and photography. <br /> <br />There is the possible perception that an arthouse-like poster and promise of subtitles will mean superior fare, but there is a lot of junk out there, period. Worth a rental maybe as it is not totally without merit.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|In our English class this year, we read and watched F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  So our teacher Mr. Yochum told us that if we wrote a review on the book and movie, then we could earn a couple more points in the class. <br /> <br />When I first saw the movie, every character was exactly how I had imagined him or her to look. Unfortunately, as the movie went on, I felt that some of the personalities of the characters didn't match that of the description in the book.  Daisy (Mia Farrow) seemed to be even ditsier than Fitzgerald made her out to be.  I noticed as I was reading the book that Daisy had a couple of random comments, but when I saw the movie I felt that Mia Farrow made Daisy to look like she was a complete idiot when she said some of these lines.  I also think that Bruce Dern, who played Tom Buchanan, could have had a meaner, more forceful attitude.  While reading the book, I thought that Tom was a more controlling and stern man rather than one who attended to his wife's wants every time she told him to do something. <br /> <br />Other than those two characters, I felt that Jordan Baker, Nick Caraway, and Jay Gatsby were portrayed very well.  They had the right attitudes, looks, and characteristics to fit their part.  The scenery was also done very well to fit Fitzgerald's descriptions and was exactly how I had imagined them to look. <br /> <br />Of all the books that I have had to read during high school, I would have to say that The Great Gatsby was the best one.  It is a really good classic book that doesn't have that boring, hard to understand language that books such as Macbeth by William Shakespear does.  It's also not a very long book, which is very appealing to me.  I didn't mind the movie, but I felt that the book gave you a better sense of what was going through the character's heads.  So if you have the time, I would recommend reading the book rather than watch the movie, because I think that it really would be worth your while and youwould be glad that you read it.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This was nothing like the rest James Bond's.  They were more exciting. <br />This one was not very good, there was not story to it. <br />I think the writer's need to go back to the drawing board. <br />Next time make it more action packed and the edge of your seat type. <br />This one was not.   And when you thought there was a story it ends. <br />A new James Bond - Daniel Craig - he is good as James Bond, but this story line was not good at all.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This is an amazing two-disc release. Director Robert Rodriguez brilliantly brings to life Frank Miller's graphic novels, and does not hold back with the development of these gritty characters. Mickey Rourke alone deserves 5 stars for his portrayal of Marv. This set is worth having strictly on the merits of the development of that character. For anyone who has a love for the making of films and the time consuming processes involved in the \\"behind the scenes\\", the bonus disc will satisfy your appreciation for the multifaceted areas of story telling. Let's hope that when Frank Miller's \\"300\\" is released to DVD, that the extras will be just as enjoyable.

That's a great thing in today's polarized society, where militant devotion to a point of view rather than moderation and common sense is the norm. When school shootings occur, the media and the public launch into debates about how and why this could have happened. Through deft storytelling and great insight, Picoult shows us just how it can happen. As with all of her books, Nineteen Minutes is eye-opening and touching without being treacly.

0790734850|5.0|Curtis Hanson's \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" based on the [[ASIN:0446674249 third book]] in a series by James Ellroy, works so well because, unlike most neo-noir films, it's not a homage to the noir films of old.  In fact, it was probably the first true film noir to forget about its predecessors since the 1950s, the time period around which the film is set.  And it was just what a film noir should be: gritty, tough, unflinching, intricrate, and confounding.  Each of the film's leading actors, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey, as well as its lead actress, Kim Basinger, felt like they could've appeared in a film noir straight out of the 1940s.  It's this unnostalgic, straightforward approach that made \\"L.A. Confidential\\" so great.    The storyline had a classic vibe to it: in 1950s L.A., three cops ferret out the corruption beginning to eat away at the police force.  How each of them does this differs.  You've got your good cop, played by Guy Pearce, a strictly by-the-book wannabe detective and the son of a legendary officer who died in the line of duty.  You got your bad cop, Russell Crowe, a violent star on the force, always on the edge and with a particularly nasty dislike for women abusers.  Then you have a cop who doesn't quite know where he stands, played by Kevin Spacey, except on the set of TV's number-one hit police drama \\"Badge of Honor,\\" which he supervises.  One of the film's best scenes is when Pearce's character tells Spacey why he became a cop in an effort to convince Spacey to work with him.  Afterwards he asks, \\"Why did you become a cop?\\"  Spacey smiles sadly and sighs, \\"I don't remember.\\"  Picking a favorite of this police trio is hard, because each is perfectly cast: Pearce as an inherently contemptable and ultimately honorable goody-goody, Crowe as an apparent maniac who is smarter than he looks and just trying to do what's right, and Spacey as the pitiful once-cop who's lost his way.    But it seems like when most people remember \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" they remember Kim Basinger, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.  She deserved it.  Basinger played a prostitute in high demand because she bears a strong resemblance to Veronica Lake (so does Basinger) - but there's much more to her than just a divine appearance.  Similarly, there's more to Basinger than just a fine body, and she proved it here with a surprisingly deep performance, particularly for a supporting role.    With all that said, it's apparent that the film garnered much of its power from its sharp-cut characters.  There's no one who is clearly \\"good\\" the whole way through, but never once is a character in the grey: they're either good, or they're bad.  They are also some of the most realistic and human people ever to appear in a film noir.  The movie's script, by director Hanson and Brian Helgeland, finds a seamless balance between its characters and its story, and surprisingly holds very little of the snap, crackle n' pop dialog one expects in a film noir.  Jerry Goldsmith's score was the one homage the film allowed, with the same sort of morose brass you might expect in an old Bogey pic (and which distinctly recalls the same woeful trumpeting of Goldsmith's theme from Roman Polanski's own neo-noir, \\"[[ASIN:B000022TSH Chinatown]]\\").  It was one of those elusive scores that adds life to each scene but also expands the film as a whole.    There's something about the look of the film that hangs in my mind.  It may be the color scheme, which consists mostly of black but with the occasional surprise vibrance thrown in through a red or yellow.  Or perhaps it's the lighting, a bright light that makes what's in front of us perfectly clear and a surrounding black mist that begs the question: what does it hide within its shadows?  There is a scene in which Pearce's character pulls up in front of the Nite Owl bar.  That scene brings to mind the painting \\"Nighthawks\\" by Edward Hopper (which inspired the look of Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\").  Hanson took a very stylistic approach in his directing of the film, and much of that showed through its dark visuals.    It wasn't all darkness, though.  One of the film's most memorable scenes involved an attempted interrogation by Pearce and Spacey at a popular club late at night.  They corner a mobster dating a girl they believe is a prostitute belonging to a popular company which advertises prostitutes who resemble celebrities, in this case Lana Turner.  As Pearce begins throwing out insults at the mobster and especially at his date, we notice Kevin Spacey holding back laughter in the background.  \\"A w---e who looks like Lana Turner is still a w---e,\\" Pearce says.  The \\"prostitute\\" tosses her drink in his face and he stands there, soaked and incredulous, as Spacey says, \\"That IS Lana Turner.\\"    It came as little surprise that \\"L.A. Confidential\\" wasn't awarded the Oscar for Best Picture, but fortunately critics recognized it as one of the best films of 1997 and, more importantly, of the decade.  It wasn't only one of the best films of the decade, but one of the best films ever made, a stylish, gritty, cynical yet realistic noir drama that didn't look back at the classics which inspired it.  It didn't need to, because ten years later, we're still looking back at it.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This movie could really have a genre all its own. It really is a mind bender, but not in a way that's difficult to understand. When Joal's spontaneous girlfriend decides to specifically erase memories of him after a break up, she sets off a whacky chain of events. Though science thinks it's found a way to erase painful memories, the couple discovers that maybe memories are best left alone, even if they're bad. Though the film is a drama, there is some humor thrown in. A great watch for those looking for something 'different'.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000IFQLLY|4.0|What can be said about Depeche Mode? They are definitely a major band. They are the only band from the era to stay popular for 25 years and \\"be new\\" constantly. They are the only rivals to REM and U2. Those rare bands that constantly do new albums that are interesting and can play large arenas and not seem like a nostalgia act. This \\"Best Of\\" collection may not be for the real Depeche Mode fan. They probably have all these tracks. I just saw them for the first time last year, and was thrilled. They came out of the electronic scene that John Foxx, Gary Numan, and New Order created. I don't think it was until \\"Everything Counts\\" that Depeche Mode had broken away from the pack. It has been said that they took their music into a dark place in the last 1980s, and they only got more popular. I find myself being attracted to \\"Shake The Disease\\" most of all from the early material. It just sound like the most advanced thing they ever did musical, and vocally. I also like \\"Precious\\" a lot. This is a cool collection.

B000IHY146|5.0|Karen Dalton is a name that could have been forgotten. You hear about her a little in the Bob Dylan biographies. Then you would hear people like Nick Cave and Devendra Banhart talking about her. This is an amazing album. It first came out in 1971. It kind of reminds me when I was listening to a lot of Candi Staton a few years ago. Dalton has a great voice. Blues and gospel influence it. \\"Something On Your Mind\\" is just an amazing song. The chord changes are mind-blowing. Dalton also does a few songs that have been popularized by others, such as \\"When A Man Loves A Women\\" and \\"How Sweet It Is.\\" She really puts her own stamp on them. She sings like a blues singer but the music is mostly like folk rock. \\"Katie Cruel\\" was a big influence on Nick Cave. The opening to \\"In A Station\\" is so great and evocative. The band sounds like it goes through ten different instruments. There is a great banjo sound on \\"Same Old Man.\\" The song \\"One Night Of Love\\" sounds very modern. This is a great album of ten solid tunes. This is definitely a big deal.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Pop radio, move over.  Avril Lavigne is here to stay with her new fantastic album \\"THE BEST DAMN THING.\\" <br /> <br />This album is much different from her first two releases, but there are moments (such as \\"Runaway\\") when you hear elements of \\"LET GO\\" and moments where \\"UNDER MY SKIN\\" is present. <br /> <br />Avril has evolved into a beautiful woman and her ability to write songs is amazing.  Even more amazing is that voice that this small woman delivers.  She sends chills down your spine with her GORGEOUS ballads \\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Innocense\\", and she gives you attitude that you expect from her. <br /> <br />Avril has earned her spot as one of pop music's finest vocalists.  I look forward to watching the rest of her career.
B000IMV4IW|4.0|Noel Gallagher said that they would never release these greatest hits, but here it is. Much like their peers, Blur, Pulp, Supergrass, Suede, and Verve, Oasis has all released greatest hits CDs after ten years. Britpop is now a decade old. It is still popular, and very few bands, other than Arctic Monkeys, and Libertines, have come and replaced them with something better or equal. Oasis' recent tour featured most of the songs from this collection, plus a few more from the new Don't Believe The Truth. These songs have soaked into the British sensibility like no other recent UK band. Of course we have \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Supersonic\\" from the first album. There are \\"Wonderwall\\" from the second. But there is not so much from after Be Here Now. Half of the album is from the first two albums. The other half is early b-sides, and one or two tracks, from the rest. It's kid of an odd collection. Most of the Oasis fans have all these tracks on the previous releases. Some of the other Britpop bands offered some new tracks or unreleased material. Placebo had a DVD included. I guess Oasis is saying to all future generation: \\"Here is the classics, if you want to look into it further, check out the other albums.\\" Great cover by Peter Blake. One Liam song is included.

B000IU3XTM|4.0|Damien Rice came out a few years ago and blew everyone away. He has always been more popular in America than the UK for some reason. Damien Rice sort of started this thing that others like James Blunt and Keane have continued. I wasn't such a big fan before. I saw him play for a long time at the KCRW year-end show. I got to meet him too. But a new Damien Rice record seems like a breath of fresh air compared to the thought of another James Blunt offering. Damien Rice said that he wasn't going to tour this album, but he has already toured with Fiona Apple. I think he is playing a few more shows. \\"9 Crimes\\" is a wonderful opener. There are more strings on songs like \\"The Animals Were Gone.\\" The song \\"Elephant\\" reminds me of stuff on the previous album. Over the years, Damien Rice has formed a band around him. Lisa Hannigan is very important to the sound of this record. The whole record sounds like a band effort and not just a solo artist. This is not really my thing, but it's pretty good anyway and despite of me.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|Bottom line... heck, even my kids are bored by the thing.<br /><br />To fully understand why SPIDERMAN 3 was a tremendous disappointment, I had to break it down like this. I went along the timeline of the film and wrote down the times that storylines popped in and how much of each there was... Here is what I found:<br /><br />In a 2:19:00 movie. The venom storyline, apart from the slambang finale that was actually really good, consisted of a :38 scene, an :08 scene, a 2:15 scene, a 3:50 scene, a 2:55 scene and a :42 scene, adding up to 10:28. 10:28? To boot, the venom storyline doesn't take off until the 1:03:40 point of the movie.<br /><br />The Sandman storyline consists of 15:32 of film time. Dramatic scenes and everything.<br /><br />There was 25:57 worth of action scenes, including Goblin, Venom & Sandman... other than the finale, which was slightly less than 22 minutes.<br /><br />1:10:40 of the film was reserved for the romance storyline and other random dramas, like friendship and photography. Peter wanting to ask Mary Jane to marry him. Them going out to dinner. Peter making a jerk of himself at a club she's singing at. Peter telling his Aunt that he's gonna ask her. Peter dancing around like something out of Saturday Night Fever. Rehashing the old storyline of how his Uncle died. Harry Osborn and Mary Jane cooking omelets and dancing around. Mary Jane being replaced from her Broadway show.<br /><br />The 1:10:40 doesn't even include the dramatic scenes that involve Sandman and his plight to save his daughter.<br /><br />Ultimately, the movie has a terrible, no, 'terrible' is too generous, DEPLORABLE flow. Personally, I wanted to see more venom. Yet, I got a little more than 10 minutes of venom in 1:57:00 of movie time and had to wait until the 1:03:40 point for him to materialize. Action scenes were few and far between. Two minute action scenes were broken up by long scenes of emotional baggage.<br /><br />I want so badly to give this movie more than 2 stars. The action scenes, when they happen are really really good. Yet, for the life of me, I can't understand why the creators of this film skimped so much on action. They've made TONS and TONS of money with this trilogy. You'd think that they'd try and reward the viewers who have made them FILTHY RICH... yet, it seemed as though they were filming on a budget...<br /><br />So, bottom line... if you don't mind SPIDERMAN 3... the soap opera, you'll love this movie. If you wanted to see Venom, and lots of him, you'll be tremendously disappointed. Ultimately, there were too many storylines, and you'd think that these filmmakers would have learned a lesson from the original Batman movies. Apparently... they didn't.d.

B00005JPD0|3.0|I actually bought this dvd because others recommended it obviously some people tastes need improvement - has some decent actors Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer both have the experience to have included a better ending - the film follows the investigation of a river boat blowing up near New Orleans with the FBI having this new equipment that can see four days into the past which is used to track the perpetrators, the story line is actually good even after Denzel Washington realizes that he can travel back in time to save one of the victims its not until the ending when they try to stop the bomb blowing the ship that the plot goes right down the drain
B000002J2D|5.0|what do you say about the band!there just a great \\"rock & roll band\\" there words & music say it all...........
B00005JPRT|5.0|I haven't seen \\"Music & Lyrics,\\" the movie in which Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore play a songwriting-romantic pair, but John Carney's \\"Once\\" probably can be described as a cross between \\"Music & Lyrics\\" and \\"Brief Encounter.\\" This delicate little tale of the musical collaboration and almost-romance between a thirtysomething Dublin street busker (Glen Hansard) and a young Czech immigrant to Ireland (Marketa Irglova) leaves us breathless with its simplicity and beauty. There's a certain amount of stylization--this is the movies, after all--but not the kind we're used to from movie musicals. The beautiful, melancholy songs--nearly all of them by Hansard and/or Irglova--arise organically from the characters, because they are musicians, and the songs they write are how they express themselves. Hansard and Irglova both have lovely, impassioned singing voices, and as actors they have a natural, unforced charisma. (Irglova is a first-time actress, but viewers may remember Hansard as Outspan, guitarist for \\"The Commitments.\\") Carney's hand-held cameras give the film a near-documentary feel that nevertheless doesn't skimp on either sentiment or humor. The film's very first scene, depicting Hansard's attempts while busking to keep an obnoxious drunk from stealing his tips, is laugh-out-loud funny while demonstrating the precariousness of Hansard's existence. \\"Once\\" is that rare musical that envelops us in music and beauty while bringing home the tough reality of the characters' lives.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I was plesently surprised by this cd. I thought it was better then Dead Man's Chest but I still like the Black Pearl more.  <br />Hoist the Colours- 4.5/5 I just wish it were longer, you hear pieces of it throughout but I swear it was longer in the movie <br />Singapore- 5/5 traditional pirates song with oriental instruments mixed in <br />At Wit's End- 5/5 one of the best songs on the cd <br />Multiple Jacks- 4/5 not everyones cup of tea, its good don't get me wrong but a bit werid, but considering the scene.... <br />Up is Down- 4.5/5 its a fun song, it took me awhile to like, i didn't like it till after I saw the movie <br />I See Dead People in Boats- 5/5 lovely sad piece, it can be haunting, it gets energetic the last few minutes <br />The Brethren Court- 4/5 has some of Multiple Jacks in it then there is some haunting singing and then fun music thats like carnival music but not...just listen to the song <br />Parlay 4/5 its good but i usually skip over this song <br />Calypso- 4/5 my least favorite song, but I still like it <br />What Shall We Di For- 5/5 one of my favorites, uplifting song <br />I Don't Think Now is The Best Time- 5/5 the best song (to me) i just wish it were longer <br />One Day- 5/5 I really like this song, its sad and calm which is a nice break from the last song <br />Drink up me Hearties- 5/5 one of my favorites, maybe the second best song after I Don't Think Now is The Best Time <br />Overall its a good cd, but I just wish they put every song on the cd. I know it would be like two disks or something, but there are songs or part of songs thats missing that I wish they put on the cd.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|First of all, I am impressed with the eloquence of most of the posters. Wow, what great thoughts to share with fellow LOST fans.  I'm afraid I may not be eloquent, but I love the show, nonetheless.    There is no other show I look forward to every week, but this one. After I watch each episode, i always marvel at how well the story was told and how something seemingly unimportant (as the van with dead Roger in it), meant so much after all.    This show has such talented people behind it to be able to foreshadow and tie events together with such finesse. There are some points I am still a little curious about, but I am sure it will be explained as the seasons progress.    The actors and actresses are amazing. I love the depth of their actings and how they play out their characters and make me care weekly what happens to them.    The third season was amazing, I most especially loved the episodes after the break. I was shocked when Eko died because I believed they could have used his muscle (LOL), but then with the deaths of all the tailies (except from Bernard's) the focus comes back to the fronties, the people that the audience really cared about.      The season ender was so breathtaking and makes me sad to think I have to wait a longgggg time before I get to watch the events after the rescue play out.    Kudos to everyone behind this show. You are the reason I turn the TV on weekly.

0316018953|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Connelly's but this is my favorite book that he's penned. It moves fast, it hits hard and the characters are strong. I can't say that about a lot of his books.  <br /> <br />It's nice to see an author improve as he goes along. Some authors in my opinion, are content to rest on their laurels. Perhaps because he's an ex newspaperman Connelly wasn't a finely tuned author initially. But he's really come along. I recommend this book.  <br /> <br />Speaking of authors who really came along in their careers I just re-read Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, which reminded me in some craxy way of Connelly. Not in subject matter, just in the phrasing. [[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle]]
B0002NRQTI|5.0|I feel that this is probably overall the best rock album that I have ever purchased.  Every song (except for maybe \\"Speed of Love\\") ranks as one of my favorites.  The instrumental track, \\"Leave That Thing Alone,\\" is one of the best rock instrumentals I have ever heard.  Every song is thought provoking and the musicianship is top notch.
B00005M91K|5.0|I own at least 500 DVDs. If you asked me which is my favorite film/DVD I would have to say \\"Baraka,\\" because, if for no other reason, it is the DVD I watch most. Scarcely a week goes by that I don't watch Ron Fricke's masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Masterpiece\\" is not a term I use lightly. In fact, it's not a term I use at all but it describes this film. First, it is simply beautiful. If you have a home theater system that you take pride in, this is the one DVD to own. It's approximately ninety minutes are spread over two layers: as a result the picture is almost HD-like, especially if you have an \\"upscaling\\" DVD player and a suitable display.<br /><br />The music, a combination of Michael Stearn's original score and contributions by artists like \\"Dead Can Dance,\\" compliment the visuals perfectly.<br /><br />None of this would matter if the subject of the film weren't worthy of your consideration. Rest assured, it is. I don't trust the words \\"spiritual\\" or \\"spirituality\\" but I will make an exception for \\"Baraka.\\" As Fricke puts it in the documentary on the DVD, while we have been invited to live on the planet, life has not given any of us a veto over the guest list. \\"Baraka\\" is about that \\"guest list.\\"<br /><br />There is no other film I can say this about: I watch it a lot because I am always a better person for having watched it. 12/10
B000QQFKYE|5.0|`Inland Empire' is full of surprises. Convoluted and suspenseful we follow the story lines of successful actress Nikki (Laura Dern) who is waiting for the results of a tryout for a new Hollywood movie, `On High in Blue Tomorrows`. Soon she is visited by her new Polish immigrant neighbor. In her nosey way she pries information, but also intensely warns her of bad omens. She foretells that Nikki will obtain the part she has tried out for, but the story, is a remake and a murder will take place. She intensely relates folk tales, including one about a girl at the marketplace in an alley behind the palace who loses her memory. \\"Forgetfulness happens to us all,\\" she relates. She also incessantly speaks of \\"unpaid bills\\" in a scathing fashion. Rebuffing the neighbor's pointed comments, the actress asks the suspicious elderly woman to leave.     The movie fast-forwards to the next day as the woman foretells in the narration. The gypsy fades out with a vengeance. Nikki gets the part, and on the set we meet Devon (Justin Theroux), her dashing, handsome co-star. The director (Jeremy Irons) facilitates a script reading where he relates that the film is indeed a remake; one where a murder took place and was allegedly cursed from the start.     From here the movie weaves its way through many scenes. Nikki's husband warns the young co-star of the consequences of sneaking out with his actress wife. Some feature Southern characters Billy and Sue in the movie, but they are so closely connected to their actual lives that we begin to lose our own grip on reality. Eerily suspenseful scenes show (Nikki or Sue) walking through a house in bewildered trepidation. Then, we are transported to the lives of the screen couple in the backyard. Next, we find them in Poland during the dead of winter. In one scene the actors are having an affair; in another the characters are. To spice things up, we get a play with actors in rabbit costumes performing an absurdist comedy. At certain points, just when we feel grounded, a woman is watching all the drama on television in her dark apartment.     The developments of `Inland Empire' are intriguing. Like `French Lieutenant's Woman' (significantly also with Jeremy Irons) there's a movie story mixed within a real story. Unlike `FLW' it isn't easy to tell where one story ends and the other begins. In ways like Altman's `The Player,' we have to decide what components are real and which are not. One finds oneself asking many questions while watching the movie. Which parts are from the movie? Which parts are real life? Are the scenes in Poland real or are they components of the original film? Is this all seen through a viewer's eyes or is it all part of the movie? Is she crazy or is her character crazy? Surely, the theme of misogyny is at the forefront as we come across prostitutes and male abuse. Not to mention the claustrophobic fishbowl existence of celebrity life.  One thing is for certain, the movie is assembled expertly. It comes across like a mansion full of mirrors--like a fun/haunted house. Not everyone will like the exit strategy (Afterall, who likes hitting the pavement after a funhouse?) but it certainly provides a strange and intense experience.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Kinda suprising soundtrack, usually you have one epic theme and the other songs on CD kinda suck or are good 'background' songs for the movie but by themselves kinda boring. Most of the songs on cd are very epic variation on main theme(s) without drifting into the 'background theme' category. Like I can listen to them standalone.     Hard to make a list of favorite, but in order most favorite to least:    Drink Up Me Hearties - Has a mix of themes. most similar to the previous main POTC themes and new romantic theme. very epicy and once going gets fast paced.     One Day - a more slower placed epic song. mix of old themes and ends with a love theme.    Up Is Down - a short fun fast epic paced theme, starts off with an irishy flute, and ends with a strong orchestra.    What Shall We Die For - a short slower paced chorus song, that gradually builds up patriotic/pirate feelings lol/    Parlay - cool western epic-y theme, reminds me ALOT of Ennio Morricone's western 'Once Upon a Time in the West' harmonica theme made with a layer of wailing guitar).     At Wit's End - cool epic song with some nice chorus singing and organs. Reminds me of Lord of the rings Riders of Rohan themes.    I See Dead People In Boats - another slow version of main theme.    I Don't Think Now Is the Best Time - a 11 minute epic feast.    -------the songs above here i like alot, below less so    Singapore - alright theme with asian feel.    The Brethren Court - a slow short theme    Hoist the Colours - a small singing at beg of movie. like to listen to it once, but not often.    Multiple Jacks - eh background music for mult jack scenes    Calypso - eh background music? i didnt like it.

B000002I2I|5.0|This is my favorite of the Doors' catalog. It is stripped bare of the pretention Jimbo was infamous for, the psychedelic crud, and the poppy banality of their previous releases. Their debut, while one of the best debuts of any rock group, still maintained one of my least favorite songs in their canon, the oft-hailed but unendingly dull and pompous \\"The End.\\" I'm sure the cursors are furiously searching for the \\"no\\" button at the bottom of this review, but I find that \\"opus\\" to be sophomoric and indicative of the worst Morrison brought out from his notebook meanderings. Thankfully, Morrison Hotel has none of that. Jim keeps the non-sequitors and \\"Hey! Listen to me! I studied philosophy!\\" references in control and writes more straight-forward and purposefully than before. Perhaps he realized that his utopian vision of changing the world had dissipated like the smoke from so many joints in the audience he dared to manipulate and who, in the end, ignored his attempts at social experimentation and instead cried out for \\"Light My Fire.\\" Whatever the reason, it's to our advantage that Morrison Hotel finds Jimbo focusing on simply being a member of a very good band. To that end, the vastly underrated guitar work of Robbie Krieger is the musical focus of this work, from the galloping intro of Roadhouse Blues to the trebly riff which closes out Maggie McGill, this album is a Krieger showcase. He demonstrates his unique finger-picking style, slide chops, and genre virtuosity throughout this powerful album. The FM staples \\"Peace Frog\\" and the aforementioned \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" are masterworks for both the guitarist and the band.<br /><br />In fact, one of the best things about Morrison Hotel is that it is the best recording of the Doors as a band, per se, opposed to a combo backing an erratic poet. Even the inside photo, one of the coolest ever of these guys, is a balanced shot of the foursome, instead of the more common ones with Jim front and center and the other three taking up space in the background. Morrison Hotel is a rocking, bluesy, and bare-bones piece of American rock and roll that stands as the most concise and cohesive highlight in the brief history of this influential band.ace in the background.

0345494768|5.0|I swore never to put another dollar in George Lucas's wallet. But I'm sorry, this is the most beautiful thing I have seen in 30 years. The \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" of Star Wars books? I'll go further. It's the \\"Jungleland\\" of Star Wars books. Between the pictures (TONS of never seen before - after 30 years!!!) and the content, and SO MANY STORYBOARDS AT LAST, nothing Star Wars related has geeked me out so hard as this book has. I thought Star Wars Chronicles was good. But holy moly! I've always yearned for a \\"Star Wars\\" only book like this, before it was even called Episode anything! I'm not gonna tell you to buy this book. I'm telling you to go to a bookstore and thumb through it. If you DON'T buy it, seek help. May the Force be with you all!
0349113912|5.0|Sedaris's work is original, humorous and poignant.  This is the best of his writing and a great place for a reader to begin his love affair with Sedaris.  Sedaris is an extremely prominent figure in the world of the memoir.  If this is a type of literature that generally interest you, this will be a treat.
B000O174CM|5.0|Great movie. However I don't know why Beyonce was considered the star of the movie when it was really Jennifer Hudson who was the star of the movie. I guess the theme of the movie is in real life too. I was a good movie and I loved the music. The standout songs in the movie to me were \\"Move\\", \\"Listen\\", and \\"I Am Changing\\" I was waiting for the movie to come out on DVD so I could watch it again.

B0001ZXM54|4.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival was probably the first rock band to really bring back the original boogie rock sound originated by Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and the other rock n' roll pioneers of the 1950's.  When Creedence broke up in 1972, a gritty blues-rock trio from Texas called ZZ Top scored their first hit \\"La Grange\\" a year later and became the next band to carry that infectious three-chord boogie sound into the 70's and 80's at a time when most rock bands were focusing on heavy metal and other styles of rock.      Dusty Hill and Frank Beard make up one of the most rock solid rhythm sections in rock n' roll, and Billy Gibbons is surely one of the hottest blues-rock guitar masters out there. These three guys are responsible for some of the best blues-flavored rock n' roll of the past three decades, and all their classic hits and best-known material is here in this excellent two-disc compilation released in 2004. The first CD covers the best of the band's blues-flavored 70's material, and their more commercial, mainstream rock hits of the 80's are compiled on the second CD.     The only problem with this collection is the last half of the second disc. Rather than making the set more comprehensive by including some of ZZ's later material from the 90's, we get an average live recording of \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" that adds nothing to the original version, a useless remake of Elvis Presley's \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" {why did they choose to cover one of Elvis' worst songs?}, and unnecessary \\"remix\\" versions of \\"Legs\\" and the forgettable \\"Velcro Fly\\" which is surely one of ZZ Top's weakest songs.  This is still the best greatest hits compilation currently available for the casual fan though. All of the band's best-loved material is presented here with great remastered sound.    Few bands from 40 years ago are still out there today with the original members in place. ZZ Top has survived into the new century and are still rockin' as strong as ever.  I got the chance to catch themin concert on their 2003 tour with Ted Nugent and Kenny Wayne Shepherd as the opening acts. Billy, Dusty, and Frank delivered a sound so full and tight that it sounded like four or five guys on stage instead of three!  What is sorely needed is a live concert DVD of these legendary rock n' roll hall of famers that has never been issued after all these years.    If you want to discover what REAL rock n' roll is all about, get a copy of this collection along with CCR's classic \\"Chronicle\\" CD.
060634604X|4.0|Love him or hate him, James Frey is an excellent writer with the ability to think (and write) outside the box. His semi-autobiographical story, marketed as a memoir, about life as a recovering alcoholic and drug-addict holds tight to the reader's attention. From the start, when he wakes up on an airplane, black and blue and without any memory of how he got there, to his adventures while in the drug treatment facility, relationship with his parents, friendships with fellow addicts, and life on the outside, the reader feels compelled to read on, even though it's often like watching a train wreck. His quirky style, which incorporates things like lines containing a few words (or just one), to his mantra proclaiming he's, \\"an Alcoholic and a Drug Addict and a Criminal\\" (and a Fibber) to his unusual use of capital letters, it's all good. Choose A Million Little Pieces over Broken by William Cope Moyers and Katherine Ketcham and Tweaked by Patrick Moore. Sequels are rarely as good as the first, which holds true in the case of My Friend Leonard.

0061124265|5.0|After reading \\"The Alchemist\\" and being touched by its message, I decided to read \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\".  This book deals with the freedom of being considered insane and the appreciation of life's precious moments when faced with imminent death.   As in the Alchemist, Mr. Coelho delivers an easy to read book laced with a lot of ideas and inspiration to ponder.  I find it unfortunate that readers judge books in comparison with previous books written by the same author.   Veronika Decides to Die stands proudly on its own.
B00005MP58|5.0|The dialogue and the character portrayals by the actors/actresses were true to Jane Austen's orginal \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  I wasn't familiar with Colin Firth; albeit he might not have been as \\"handsome and tall\\" as described in the book, Colin Firth did an EXCELLENT job of portraying Darcy's constant state of irritation and disdain for the first half of the program. Minimal dialogue but his facial expressions and gestures were very consistent and true to those described in the book. Colin Firth's smile during the scene where Elizabeth Bennett was playing the fortepiano at Pemberly really showed the transformation in Darcy as described by Jane Austen. Jennifer Ehle, who played Elizabeth Bennett, was well cast, as her eyes did contain that liveliness described by Austen. Ehle was far prettier than her counterpart who played the sister Jane Bennett. The only segment I thought could be better was the last scene where Colin Firth/Darcy was supposed to be over-elated at Elizabeth accepting his renewed marriage proposal. Firth's expression was a bit mild compared to that described in the book. Lastly, I enjoyed the 3rd DVD, which contained cast interviews, a tour of the estates, etc. Definitely worth buying if you're a fan of Jane Austena and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"!
B0000009TJ|4.0|i saw a couple of shows on this tour the last two times i saw frank perform. it is a great band, did he ever have a bad one or an uninspired one? as far as this being the best live disc or discs? no. the sound quality is awesome the arrangements interesting and if you like big band productions this is for you.....
1594200823|5.0|Recommended to me by my vet after the tainted dog food scare, Michael Pollan's book couldn't have been more relevant and eye opening.  What I learned about the food chain and the cruelty to animals it entails will change my decision making forever in many areas.  The writing is engaging and clear, with a wry sense of humor and irony that had me laughing out loud in places and crying in others. I admire the objectivity and non-editorializing around the issues (although I doubt I could have avoided it).  I'm off to the bookstore to purchase other titles by this author.  Thanks Mr. Pollan for raising my consciousness!
B000001ABD|5.0|I often wonder what it must be like to be a musical genius, and whenever I listen to Stevie Wonder I find the answer.  When I was a little girl I wanted to be a singer (despite being tone deaf), so I appreciate anyone that has true musical ability.  Not only does Stevie have a great voice, he can play practically every instrument invented.  One of the words that comes to mind when listening to him is \\"awesome\\". That's all you can really say about him.  His music is timeless.  From \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\\" to \\"Do I Do\\" and \\"That Girl\\" (my favorites) he just shines and shines. This is real music by a real artist.  No matter how many times I listen to this CD, I'll never tire of it.  Excellent.
B000MV9026|3.0|This isn't a review about the movie itself but the fact it wouldn't play on one of our DVD players.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Maybe I was expecting more songs like Sweet Escape, but I was a little disappointed with the rest of the music on this.  This IS my first Gwen Stefani Album, so maybe I wasn't aware of the genre of music she does.
B000002H38|5.0|When this album came out in 1986, Anita Baker injected radio with some much-needed soul.  Quite simply, there was nothing like \\"Rapture\\" on the radio in the mid-'80s. Her smoky voice and jazzy songs were the opposite of the music of the divas of the day, Madonna, Whitney and Janet.   <br /> <br />Twenty years later, the album's music has not aged a day at all.  Sweet Love is one of the best radio singles to come out of the '80s, and Caught Up in the Rapture is right up there with it.   <br /> <br />The only drawback is that after 20 years, the CD quality is not up to par in this day of sleek technology and remastering.  Why this album remains in the vaults waiting to be dusted off and remastered remains a mystery to me.  If any album from the '80s deserves to reissued, this is it.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I really love this cd, its one of the best I've gotten in a long time.
B000P2A256|5.0|I think it's just as good as the first album, if not better. I have been listening to it for 3 days straight now and I absolutely LOVE every track - especially \\"Better That We Break\\", \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" and \\"Kiwi\\".
B000O178BY|5.0|I liked a few NIN songs here and there but never was huge fan but after listening to this album several times I have to nominate this as one of the best albums I've ever listened to.  It's different but almost every single song in this album rips and you don't get tired of it.  The only sad thing is I don't think Trent Reznor will ever top this album.  That's how good it is!
B00005JPAO|4.0|The movie starts with a blip over the election of Tony Blair to Prime Minister, and quickly skips forward to the horrible day that Princess Diana died.  Caught in all the media frenzy is Queen Elizabeth II, not a fan of Diana to begin with.  The Queen wishes to keep the royal family's mourning private, but the public outcry for closure forces her to come out of her privacy shell, return to the palace from their country estate, and make a public statement.<br /><br />The movie provided some private peeks into royal life, such as the queen driving herself up into the boondocks of her estate and getting her jeep stuck in a river.  A vision of the stag her grandsons are hunting leaves her with a haunting vision of its grandeur.  It's hard to image the queen doing such mundane things as driving a jeep or setting a glass of water by her bedside instead of simply snapping her fingers for water whenever she wants it.<br /><br />There's some great acting here too.  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and the incomparable James Cromwell as Prince Philip are spectacular in their roles.  The dialogue is a bit stiff at times, but it's hard to tell if its from the scripting or on purpose because of the stiffness and formality of the royal family's, and the British elite's, communications.<br /><br />One strange thing I couldn't help noticing were the phones used as props.  Some were ancient desktop rotary phones and yet in other scenes there were modern cellular phones.  Perhaps I noticed this because I became a bit bored with the sometimes slow and stale progress of the film, but I'm sure if I decided to watch it again I would find another discrepancy.  Overall, it's a good movie to watch once.  I recommend a rent, not a purchase.  3.5 stars.  Enjoy!
B000OCXFCO|4.0|I'm really surprised by the new megadeth.  With songs like \\"Washington is next!!\\" megadeth really seems to go back to their roots.  Playing fast sustained melody with intricate transitions really showcases how technically talented these musicians are.  Good job Mega!
1591391105|4.0|This is a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone taking on a new role. I found it to be clear and has some very useful advice about dealing with your new boss and reports, and what kind of mind-set to adopt. very useful. I gave it only 4 stars however because at the end of the book he touts all the great resources you will find at [...] that you can use and share to get everyone on the same page. Well, there are no resources there that I could find (except to purchase more of his books). I was very disappointed, enough to feel it takes away from the book.
0151013047|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I don't get many chances to read books these days because I write so many myself. This one just called to me when I saw it on the shelf.<br /><br />Mohsin Hamid gives us an opportunity to enter a conversation between a Pakistani Muslim and an American as they dine in a restaurant in Lahore. We never hear the voice of the American, but we pick up hints about who he is and what he's doing.<br /><br />From a big picture perspective, we see even more. We see a world at war, a world in which people have drawn a line in the sand and said, \\"Anyone on that side of the line is THEM. Anyone on this side of the line is US.\\"<br /><br />Reading Hamid's book, though, I was deeply struck by the reality that there is no THEM. There is only US. We human beings live in this world together. We are often dangerous animals, predators. But we are also lovers. Love flows from us like wine flows from bottles in Italy.<br /><br />I really loved the book. I am very thankful I picked it up, and I thank you, Mohsin Hamid, for illuminating my Midwest American mind.
1594489505|4.0|[4½ stars] Although I tend to read quickly, I virtually never finish a book in a single sitting. But A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS was the exception; except for meals, I simply could not put it down. The troubled timeline of Afghan history between 1960 and 2002 made for an irresistable momentum, the country moving from monarchy to republic, suffering a soviet invasion, buffeted by apparently random fighting between factions, celebrating the restoration of order by the Taliban, only to submit to the grip of a ruthless theocracy; the book ends in a quiet epilogue a few months after the installation of the Karzai government by the Americans.<br /><br />But history alone does not make a novel. What Khalid Hosseini does here, even more than in [[ASIN:1594481776 THE KITE RUNNER]], is to create a couple of deeply sympathetic central characters, through whose eyes we see -- and through whose skin we feel -- the impact of this history on ordinary people. The book is dedicated in part \\"to the women of Afghanistan,\\" and perhaps the most significant decision that Hosseini makes is to write this time from a female perspective. For nothing in recent Afghan history shows such dramatic changes as is reflected in the treatment of women, moving in a few years from the open access to education under the soviets to the total repression of the Taliban -- although that repression, as Hosseini shows, is deeply rooted in a traditionalist male-dominated society.<br /><br />There are two heroines in the book, introduced separately, then brought together as rivals, finally forming a deep bond against the forces that threaten them and their children. One is Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy but weak man who keeps her isolated in the country. The other is Laila, the daughter of a former professor, whose aspirations are derailed by the violence sweeping the country. Both eventually become involved with a brutal man, but their suffering only enhances the positive qualities which come through nonetheless. For this is a love story: not just the love of a woman for a man, but also love between women, and especially the love of a child for its parent. One suspects that the novel is also Hosseini's love letter to his own mother, and to his mother-land.<br /><br />So this is a gripping book, a moving one, and a fascinating journey into a world that most of us read about but few know at first hand. Is it also a great book? Not quite, hence my reluctance to go to the full five stars. There is something a little too easy about the flow of the narrative, a slight lack of spiritual scale despite the large timeline and catastrophic events, plenty of moments that bring a tear to the eye but not many that grip the throat or the gut. There are also the same irritating fingerprints that marred THE KITE RUNNER, such as Hosseini's tendency to throw in an Afghan word and its English translation redundantly in the same sentence, even in direct speech. But the numerous readers that will make this book a huge success will gladly ignore such things. It may not quite be a WAR AND PEACE or even a DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, but it is much easier to read, moving, informative . . . and impossible to put down..

1582701709|4.0|I believe in the message of The Secret. I think that the Law of Attraction is a powerful thing and I thank Rhonda Byrne and her associates for creating a compelling book for a general audience.  The book, mostly, is anecdotes and quotes about the Law of Attraction. It's an inspiring book. When I feel myself getting down or blue, pessimistic or cynical, I pick up The Secret and read a few pages.  Invariably it turns me around mentally and gets me thinking more positively.<br /><br />And...<br /><br />You need more than the Law of Attraction to achieve your hopes and dreams.  My fear about this book is that people will ask, believe, and Not Receive what they hope for -- because they take no action.  The Secret does not go far enough in talking about creative process.  They describe it as \\"ask, believe, receive.\\"  Okay, yes, AND, in believing there must be action beyond thought, and in receiving their must be action to have dreams come true.  I believe in creative thinking and The Secret gets you started down the right path, AND, sometimes it's up to you to Solve a Problem. The Universe will provide help if you ask for it, we agree on that, AND, you have to get off the couch and act on your own best ideas to get what you want in life.  If you wish for a piano and someone brings one to your door you still have to haul that baby up three floors! That takes action, and dare I mention the word work?  It takes creative thinking, creative problem solving, and action to simply receive a gift from the Universe.<br /><br />I don't wish to be cynical about The Secret, I believe in its most essential message. I know that thinking is where things start and I applaud the way the book steers the reader towards more empowering thought patterns.  This is what is great about The Secret.<br /><br />Read The Secret.  Ask, Believe, and Receive.  AND, use your creativity to open the doors to what The Universe gives you.

B00005R0VH|4.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve version of the Clapton classic is a treat for fans; the mlps design is fairly well done and contains the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  Ths sound quality is not that well remastered though which is a shame.  This album is Clapton's love letter to George Harrison's wife to whom he was secretly in love with but what really makes it great is the guitar work on it done by both Clapton and Duane Allman.  At the time the album was made, both men were the foremost exponents of blues guitar in the world.  If anyone was better at it than Clapton, it had to be Duane Allman who tragically died soon after this album was made.  Duane's slide guitar work is still amazing to behold today.  Few people realise that it was Duane who played the lead on the famous track \\"Layla\\" with Eric playing rhythm guitar on the main riff.<br /><br />Overall, this is essential listening for fans of blues guitar and especially for students of rock guitar.<br /><br />Recommended.

B000N4SHPS|2.0|I Own and repeatedly watch the entire Rocky set. The only movies I repeat watch... Even named my boxer dog \\"Rocky\\" as a tribute to this set. I couldnt wait for this last episode to be available....I wont share the details cause if you're like me you are gonna buy it anyway. If for no other reason than to complete your set. So you can just check it out too....Having said that, I find myself thinking if this is the best Sly was going to do, I would rather he just left the set as it was, without this movie. This movie seems to be thrown together just to say it was done. I only gave it two stars for the great previous efforts. On its own, this one deserves to be \\"Minus 4.5 Stars\\".
1602830452|5.0|I first became a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes stories when I was only about 11 or 12 years of age and that was a very long time ago indeed.  Since then I have seen and heard literally hundreds of adaptations of these classic tales over the years and when it comes to audio dramatizations this set from the BBC is by far the best I've ever listened to.<br /><br />Back in 1989 the BBC undertook the enormous task of adapting all of the original Holmes stories and novels into radio plays.  Enlisting the talents of actors Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson as well as the very talented writer and producer of radio dramas Mr. Bert Coules everything seemed to fall into perfect place for this series.  The writing, acting, music and sound effects are all top notch and the listener is immediately transported to Victorian England.  Whether it be foggy London, the mean streets of the Limehouse district to the moors of Devonshire this series takes you there.<br /><br />All too often actors playing Holmes take the lazy route and simply think that by adopting the commonly conceived caricature of Holmes as nothing more than a pipe smoking detective rattling off a few brilliant deductions with a smug air is all there is to a Holmes portrayal.  Fortunately Merrison (who also looks a lot like Sidney Paget's original illustrations of Holmes) is not that kind of actor.  Its obvious he takes the role seriously and he brilliantly conveys all the many facets of Holmes' character.  Merrison's Holmes is not just a caricature he's  arrogant, petulant, eccentric, melodramatic, ruthless, compassionate and a loyal to friend to Watson.  He's everything Doyle tells us Holmes is and more.  But most important of all Merrison succeeds in making Holmes a living, breathing human being. He captures all the weaknesses and strengths of Holmes' character. Something many Holmes actors fail to do.  Michael Williams as Watson is another major success with this series.  Williams (who sadly died of cancer shortly upon completion of the series and who was also husband to Dame Judi Dench) makes for one of the best of all Watson's.  His is no bumbling idiot in the tradition of Nigel Bruce but instead is the intelligent and stalwart doctor that Doyle describes to us.  Williams makes his Watson as both the perfect foil to Holmes' often acerbic personality and the buffer between us and the often inhuman, coldly efficient Holmes.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier the technical aspects for this series are some of the finest I've ever heard for a Holmes audio production and this goes a long ways towards drawing the listener in and making them believe it really is 1895.  Also the series had a fine roster of guest actors as well.  Here are just a few: Ralph Bates, Brian Blessed, Tom Baker, Denis Quilley, Desmond Llewellyn, Judi Dench and many others.<br /><br />This set contains 64 CD's and comprise all of the original Conan Doyle Holmes canon.  Each of the short stories runs about 40-45 minutes and the novel adaptations are about 80-85 minutes in length.  All in all you get 48+ hours of some of the finest mystery stories in the English language superbly  realized in audio drama format.<br /><br />In short I cannot recommend this set of CD's enough to Holmes fans.  I know the cost is a bit steep but it is indeed worth every penny for anyone even remotely interested in Conan Doyle's immortal detective.  Over the years I have listened to my audio tape set until they have nearly crumbled into dust so I am quite glad to have this set available at last on CD here in the U.S.<br /><br />One minor note of complaint I have is with how there is no consistency with the way some of the tracks are tagged.  This will mean nothing to those of you who will listen to these discs on your CD player but for those of you who plan to put them on your iPod will have to do a bit of re-labeling of the titles, etc.  I wish that CD publishers could be a bit more consistent with their labeling.  Anyway, as I said, this is a minor quibble and will in no way keep you from enjoying this truly outstanding audio drama series.or quibble and will in no way keep you from enjoying this truly outstanding audio drama series.
1416524800|5.0|This book is only comparable to the best of the best in mysteries and thrillers. I think a book it would truly compare to is The Bourne Identity. Honestly.<br /><br />I will only reveal the background information and the start of the story. Rachel Sexton, an intelligence analyst for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), is chosen by President Zach Herney to be one of 4 other civilian scientists to examine a NASA find. Her father, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, is running in the presidential race against Zach Herney, and his biggest issue is NASA. How much NASA overspends, how much failure they've had, yadda yadda yadda. That is his basis for his entire run. He looks for every way to bring NASA down. Rachel Sexton ends up in the Arctic Circle with four other civilian scientists, Wailee Ming, Norah Mangor, Corky Marlinson, and the TV renowned Michael Tolland. President Herney's intention for bringing these scientists and Rachel to the Arctic is to have them endorse the fact that NASA has made an accurate and major find.<br /><br />All in all, this book kept me hooked the entire way through, from the grab-you-and-run first chapters, to the exciting middle, and finally, to the shocking end. This book is a must-read.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|Released in 1967, The Doors is a dark, poetic, and sensual album of songs that are tied together by the theme of leaving the old behind and starting anew. \\"Break on through to the other side\\", \\"learn to forget, learn to forget\\", and \\"we're on our way, we can't turn back\\" are some of the phrases used to define this theme. The song, Break On Through (To The Other Side) is a Doors classic, and The Crystal Ship is a hauntingly beautiful song that is one of their best. Jim wrote Twentieth Century Fox about his girlfriend, Pamela Courson (who was with him in their Paris apartment when he died in 1971). Of course, everybody knows Light My Fire, the moody, sensuous anthem, that even if somehow you didn't care for the song, would be worth sitting through until it reaches it's climactic end, and Jim Morrison screams, \\"TRY TO SET THE NIGHT ON....FIIYAAHHH\\". Now that's a rock n' roll moment! Personally, I like all of the song, including the long instrumental break in the middle. End Of The Night is a slow, spooky song with slide guitar and lyrics that continue the theme of a new beginning, \\"Take the highway to the end of the night\\". Back Door Man is The Doors' best ever blues, and the definitive version of this Willie Dixon song. Robbie Krieger starts the song with a funky guitar riff, and Jim screams a loud yell, then the song just takes off from there. Soul Kitchen is a funky song written about a favorite soul food resturant, \\"Can I sleep all night in your soul kitchen\\". Take It As It Comes is a cool, uptempo song with a good rhythm guitar sound. Then, of course, there is the notorious, scary, insane twelve minute lament, The End. It's a desolate dirge that has insane children waiting for the summer rain, a seven mile long, cold skinned, old snake, a blue bus that is taking it's passengers to an unknown destination, and a serial family  killing Oedipal nightmare. It's horrifying, disturbing, beautifully tragic, and exhilarating, all at the same time. The world had never heard anything like it in 1967, and it still stands alone today as an unrivaled piece of poetic rock music theater.  The Doors is a  youthful, explorative vision into the sensual world of the unknown that awaits those who dare to break on through to the other side. It's also intelligent, poetic, exciting, and The Doors' best album.anything like it in 1967, and it still stands alone today as an unrivaled piece of poetic rock music theater.

B00005JNTX|5.0|I have to give this movie five stars It is mezmerizing. I used to read a lot of comic book and graphic novels and even though I never read the Sin City novels I still read some of the dark black and white Manga. This whole movie looks and feels like a dark gothic comic book. I give it one star for the great story line another star for it`s cast, another star for the way it`s is filmed (black and white with accents of color )very cool, another star dark for the and creepy musical score and the 5th star well....I think I will just give that to Nancy .God bless you little girl.
B00004XQ83|2.0|I regretted buying this after listening to it once. I haven't listened to it since and that's about three months ago. Simply put, without the movie to provide a context, the music itself doesn't sell itself.  There are four cuts of 'I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow\\", two by the same artists which goes a long way to proving my point.  I haven't seen the movie in a few years and I'm sure there's a logical reason for the song being repeated in the soundtrack that many times, but I can't remember what it is.  Sometimes I like roots music with clear acoustic instrumental sounds and soulful voices. But as for an introduction to this type of music for a general listener, this is not the CD to get. It's mostly for the already converted.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|We have all of Avril's music CDs. This one is my least favorite. It has a couple of good songs on it, but most of the songs sound the same. It does'nt have the same quality as her previous songs. I was a little disapointed in it.
B000PFU7OO|1.0|If regurgitated odious drivel is your cup of tea, then this CD is for you. Glen Hansard's raspy vocals are one step shy of the \\"fingernails down the chalkboard\\" cliché. The man sounds like a 2-pack-a-day smoker. Apropos clichés, the lyrics of every song on the CD are as unimaginative and unoriginal as can possibly be. The songwriters simply strung together every known love-song aphorism into a long and painful ode, much like something one would read in a depressed teenager's diary. The themes of rejection, mistrust, endless pathetic longing are recycled mercilessly. The musical composition and Mr. Hansard's guitar playing skills fall somewhere between a drunk/stoned/semi-conscious Bob Dylan playing a benefit concert for starving Africa and a folk festival rendition of Eric Clapton's \\"Tears In Heaven\\" as performed by a street-corner Jesus on methadone. Mr. Hansard appears to be conjuring all his efforts in his endeavour to sound like a real musician, often compensating for lack of originality with his shrieks and screams, worthy of any death-metal band. If Marketa Irglova, who has an inkling of potential, wants to gain some respect as a musician, the first thing she must do is distance herself from people like Glen Hansard.
0385733577|5.0|My 13 year old son and I were both hooked by the bottom of page one.  And since then, we have been racing through the book-- devouring chapters.  With fascinating characters and a truly compelling story, it has been a wonderful world to enter.  Michael Scott is clearly a brilliant and thoughtful writer.  My son and I both agree-- there better be some sequels in the pipeline!
0452287588|4.0|I didn't read his most popular first book, The Power of Now, before I read this one. I really enjoyed his dissection of \\"The Ego,\\" and its destructive nature to our happiness and our lives. Focusing on just being aware and in the present seems so simply yet in our over-stressed \\"tread-mill\\" lives, can be challenging. While standing in line at the Rite-Aid, I happened to pick up an Enquirer Magazine, to read that Jim Carey (the actor) was reading this book and viewing the DVD, The Secret, too. I like Tolle's concept of disposing of our ego and focusing on who we are in the present and being content with what is. Good reading. I've mailed a copy off to a close friend and shared it with several other associates. Worthwhile reading if you have an interest in spiritual growth and enlightenment, not to mention being happy with your life as it is now.
B000H1QYXY|4.0|This is a greatest hits collection, spread over two CDs, including hits from GM's Wham! days. It's great for listening when reading, or reflecting back on the days when we all had mousse or gel in our spiky hair. Careless Whisper is an old friend, as is Freedom 90, but a couple of songs are missing here (Somebody to Love, with Queen, and my guilty fave, I Want Your Sex). An enjoyable collection nonetheless.
B00005NNMK|1.0|My husband and I come from musical backgrounds and listen ALL types of music. When we first played this (and it will be the LAST time) we couldn't stop laughing at the overblown, derivative 'big hair' sound of this band. This band sounds like they were attempting to copy Queen, the Scorpions, etc. The drumming is boring and basic, the guitar sounds like every band from the 80's: carpal tunnel inducing generic shred. The lyrics sound like they were written using \\"Formulaic Lyrics That Sound Like They Mean Something 101\\". And if the singer sang 'WhoaOHOHOHOHOHOaaaaaaa' once, he must have sang it a zillion times. Maybe he was in pain. I know we were after listening to this...
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Fantastic.  Utterly fantastic.  I am very pleased to have finally gotten to see a Bond movie exceed the limits of the genre.  The film exudes old-style British film charm, is gritty and realistic yet grabs at the imagination.  The film tells the tale of Bond becoming 007, and his first case thereof, and the woman who breaks into his heart, and then breaks it.  Great performances from all concerned, especially Daniel Craig and Eva Green, and Dame Judi redeems herself, finally, in my eyes.  Definitely glad to have picked this up.
B000HIVO64|5.0|I have a theory that Beck got freed musically by making Sea Change in 2002 - as \\"classic\\" as recordings like Odelay and Midnite Vultures were, they never insprired much in me; they were fun albums to admire, but never to fall in love with.  When Sea Change exposed Beck as an artist of true feeling, his music just got better and better - after Guero and now The Information, Beck is on a magnificent winning streak.  The Information features songs of urgency and drive - even in the seemingly calm and bouncy opening number, \\"Elevator Music,\\" the words come out at a speed that creates unease, and the album is like an exploration of that unease, of discovering where it lives and breathes.  By the time the second track, \\"Think I'm In Love,\\" come rumbling with a percussive drive, you're locked into Beck's speed and daring.  The Information thrives on songs like \\"Think I'm In Love\\" - fast, anxious numbers of uncertain tension, like \\"Nausea\\" or \\"Soldier Jane\\" or the thrilling collage of a final number \\"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton.\\"  The album mixes in its introspective moments well - \\"New Round\\" and \\"Movie Theme\\" are unshakeably moving - but it's The Information's anxiety that makes it so successful, so much so that its best song, \\"Strange Apparition,\\" becomes a wild, explosive, and eventually cowering anthem of the unknown, using lines like \\"Lord please don't forsake me in my Mercedes Benz\\" to render vividly and unforgettably the unease that plagues even the luckiest of us.
0393307050|4.0|This is a great, readable novel sent on a wartime sailing vessel during the Napoleonic Wars.  I have a love affair with this time period, and the sailing ships thereof, and this novel brought home the goods in both respects, conveying the realism of close quarters on a ship of war.  In this case, I also learned something: how warships of that era managed their financing, so far from home.  I may continue to explore the books in this series, from time to time.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|With all the excitement and a single like What I've Done coming from this album you would think Linkin Park was going to deliver. You would be wrong if that's what you assumed. It seemed to me they decided to overhaul their style, with very poor results. The only song I enjoyed was What I've done which was released as a single quite a while ago. My call on this: save your money and buy what I've done on iTunes. <br /> <br />I feel ridiculous with all my references being to that one song, but seriously, the rest is trash.
B000009RC2|5.0|While bands like Deep Purple played some lightning fast guitar rock back in the day, little did most people know that \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" by the Mahavishnu Orchestra featured some of the fastest and craziest rock and roll put on record.  Okay, so the album is remembered mostly for being a blend of jazz and rock, but seriously, many parts of this album are VERY close to heavy metal.  It's amazing an album with this much speed and relentless power actually existed in 1971.      If there was ever an album that needed to be heard from the very beginning all the way to the last track, it's this album.  Why?  Because each of the eight songs gradually builds and progresses into other musical sections.  The album was designed to be heard all the way through, to appreciate the entire thing as a whole.    One thing about this album that really fascinates me (and puts emphasis on the fact that it's an \\"orchestra\\") is the way each of the band members seem to be playing their respective instruments and seemingly making their own compositions by themselves.  It's like each member of the band has their own theme going on, and when the time came for the band to come together and put their ideas on tape, they did so without blending in with what the other members and instruments were doing.  For example in one song, while a fast and furious violin jam is occurring, at the same time, a burning hot guitar jam is taking place.  It opens a door for the listener and gives you an option \\"Do I want to listen to the violin, or the guitar?\\"      I think the best word to describe this album would be \\"detailed\\" because that's exactly what the music is.  Any time you are given an option on what musical instrument you'd like to listen to (because of all the creativity taking place) you KNOW you are in for a treat.    Even though the album is only 46 minutes long, it really feels like it's much longer than that.  A very interesting listen.  Oh, by the way- why does \\"The Dance of Maya\\" sound like something King Crimson was doing at the time?  Seriously, listen to the Islands album and see if you can hear some similar musical ideas from both artists.  Also, listen to the King Crimson song \\"Larks Tongue in Aspic Part II\\" and tell me there's some similarities between that and a song on this album called \\"Vital Transformations\\".  I think there's a connection between the two bands.    There are some bits of melody thrown in occasionally too.  I think if the album has one weak point, it's a bit of a dated sound to the whole thing.  One second you're listening to some really intense guitar playing, and the next it's like the Carpenters walked in the studio.  Strange.      You really should own this album.  Whether you like jazz or rock, there's something here for everyone.  The question is- can you handle it?  It's one intense listen.  Just keep that in mind before listening to it.
B000P2A256|4.0|Maroon 5 returns with thier sophomore disc \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" (although it has been 5 years) with more pop-rock which worked so well on thier first album...With smash hit first single - Makes Me Wonder sitting atop the Billboard charts, the album will once again be a mega-blockbuster, platinum album...It once again has a great smooth pop sound which crosses over many different genres and appeals to folks of all music likings... <br /> <br />Tracks such as \\"If I Never See Your Face Again,\\" and \\"Wont Go Home Without You\\" as well as \\"Nothing Lasts Forever,(which contains nearly the same chorus Adam sang on Kanye's 2005 hit Heard 'Em Say) and \\"Better That We Break\\" contain elements of R&B and soul/pop sounds while many of the remainder are a bit up-tempo but still mainstream and catchy enough to be album gems... <br /> <br />Although there is no bad spots on the album, the album fails to have major unique, adventurous, or ultra-creative songs, which allows this album to fall short of a classic album to which their first album was in which songs such as \\"She Will Be Loved\\" or \\"Sunday Morning\\" are tracks that are still played 5 yrs later and sound timeless...Nevertheless, Maroon 5 and Adam Levine show why they are perfect for any age or occassion and why they will be recieving many awards for their second consecutive record that will be played for many years to come...

B000JIHP88|4.0|This mobile really is nice because its great for a boy!  I was finding a lot of the mobiles out there were kind of girly.  The mobile is soothing, colorful and is just great.  However, if there is only one thing I could change it would be the volume.  It has 2 volume settings however, they are both low.  That is why I only gave this mobile 4 stars.  Other wise its perfect!
B00005JPKE|5.0|This really is a phenomenal achievement by Eastwood, presenting an objective look at the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe once again has such a commanding presence, like he did in The Last Samurai.  Here he plays General Kuribayashi, a wise commander whose unconventional methods causes much dissension down throughout the ranks.<br /><br />What I found stunning with this character was his past relationship with America.  He had lived in America, had many close American friends, and had a genuine respect and admiration for the country he was forced to fight against.  He also knew the insurmountable odds stacked against him in this battle but was ready to die with honor for his country.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima really depicts the emotional hardships that come with any war.  Plus it has wonderful character development that really gives you no choice but to connect with soldiers on both sides.  It also spends the vast majority of time focusing on the war itself, which is another reason why I found this movie much more profound and enjoyable than Flags of our Fathers.<br /><br />Eastwood explicitly demonstrates that when it comes to war, there is no right or wrong, good or bad, fair or unfair...<br /><br />There is only death.

B0000AUHQT|3.0|After watching The Great Gatsby I felt like I had a better understanding of the book.  It was helpful because the movie was not distorted from the book's orginal plot. I felt that the book had more details of the scenes that the movie could not be easily portray.  And I think that some parts of the movie dragged on because it was so faithful to every detail of F. Scott Fitzgerald's book.  I also saw the 2001 version of The Great Gatsby and I liked the 1974 version better because I think it did a better job of capturing the feeling of the 1920s with the new style of living with the different clothes and the contrast between West Egg and East Egg.  The casting was just as I imagined it except I thought them to be older than they looked.  At first I did not like Jordan Baker and Daisy's voices but it fit their characters who had voices full of money.  Overall I enjoyed this movie and I recommend watching this movie after reading the book.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I enjoyed the film on first viewing and was indeed amazed with Helen Mirren's performance, so loaded with nuance and pensiveness. Of course, no one rally knows what goes on behind closed doors at the Royal Palace, so the ingenuity of director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan were put to task and have created a witty and fascinating scenario. Then I listened to the DVD commentary track and realized that there were dozens of in-jokes, many of which were ultimately cut.  There's a moment when Tony Blair (brilliantly played by Michael Sheen) points out that the queen was literally forced into her position, giving up any sense of a normal life. When the Queen sees the beautiful stag, wandering freely, always in danger, I almost thought that she wished she could trade places. Later, she was more concerned about the ultimate fate of the stag that she altered her plans. I liked Helen McCrory as Mrs. Blair, the voice of public opinion regarding the Royal Family, especially at the beginning. Prince Phillip was presented (by James Cromwell) as somewhat of a buffoon, and I enjoyed Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother.Alex Jennings was very good as Prince Charles, hoping that Tony Blair would \\"modernize\\" things in England so he could relax a bit. Everything's been said before by previous reviewers, but these were my impressions. I enjoyed the film a lot, and Mirren's complex portrayal was as complete as I could only guess.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Many bands are cursed with being under a certain genre. They're known for a particular style and if anything changes in that style, there's a big risk. Some work out well; others don't. This one is the latter.  LP was known for having no cuss words in their lyrics. They were able to communicate anger, fear and other negative attitudes through passionate words and screaming vocals. Now they've replaced it with cuss words and sappy boy band clean vocals. &#34;What I've done&#34; is the best song on the album only because of the lyrics. That's the only reason this reviewer gave it two stars.  The nu-metal music is gone as well. It's mostly replaced with easy-going guitar riffs and lazy beat box sounds. Not impressive.  If you're an LP fan and wanted a new Meteora or Hybrid Theory; it won't be on this album.

B000GY729M|3.0|I absolutely ADORED Hot Fuss, and was excited about the Release of Sam's Town. After several back-to-back listens, I had to say that it just sounded overdone. They had new producers with much bigger budgets, but to me, the music just didn't have the in-your-face, raw emotion that I came to expect from this band.   However... check out the Spider-Man 3 Soundtrack - the first 30 seconds of \\"Move Away\\" let me know that the Killers are still rockin'! It's my 8 year-old son's favorite track on the disc, and we listen to the Spiderman 3 soundtrack constantly.
0743564383|5.0|Five stars are not enough for the audio of this book narrated by Campbell Scott.  I do not speak Spanish or know much about the Spanish Civil War or the geography of Spain.  It did not matter. This is a great, gripping story.      Robert Jordan is a wonderful character -- macho, intelligent, generous, deliberate.  Pablo and El Sordo, guerilla leaders, and Pilar, the \\"woman of Pablo\\" and Roberto's change agent, are fascinating, as are several Russians and Fernando, the rather prim guerilla.  Other characters are colorful, but not as engaging.  Hemingway tries very hard, but cannot quite bring Maria, the love interest, to life.      The issues are how to die well, the roles of individuals and small groups in large movements and wars, and whether any reform movement can change a country.  (Robert Jordan approaches, but does not reach the conclusion \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  Won't get fooled again.\\")  Also, does religion mean anything and is it merely \\"the opium of the people\\"?  Is it possible to live and die without religion when one was raised with it?    Campbell Scott should get an Academy Award for this narration.  He voices all of the characters well.  (It is hopeless for a man to read Maria's perpetually ernest -- no pun intended -- lines.)  He conveys the irony, the disgust, the subtle sparring very well.  He switches from the choppy Hemingway style for Robert Jordan's thoughts to the cadences of Spanish and Russian for the others.  He absolutely brings the story and the characters to life.  I have listened to many books on tape (and CD) and this is hands down the best.  Very highly recommended.  (Thanks, Dad, for giving it to me.)      In the audio edition, even the incidental music is perfect, as are the pauses before it begins and after it ends.  It is just about a perfect production.   (A map of in the CD box would make it perfect.  It should identify all the places named in the text and shows the rivers and roads mentioned -- and the bridge!! -- even if this requires more than one map.   Next best alternatives would be a CD or website with this info.  But it would be best to have a hard copy with the audio CDs.  Stephen Ambrose audio tapes about WWII came with maps like this and they were very helpful.  This would help any edition of the book in any medium, as would a bibliography of the Spanish Civil War.  [...]     I read this as a teenager and enjoyed it.  Back then, I thought that there might be many books this good out there in the world.  It turns out that there are not many books this good.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Portraying Japanese soldiers as human beings rather than soulless killing machines is an idea long overdue.  These men were husbands and fathers who missed home and family.  They were capable of compassion as well as cruelty, as were the Americans who invaded the island. <br /> <br />War is a struggle for survival with good and bad people on both sides thrown into the worst of circumstances.  It is not something to glorify or enter into lightly, but the suffering and sacrifices of those who endure it should never be forgotten.
0552998087|4.0|Like the author, I grew up in Iowa. And that's primarily why I read this book. Bryson returns to the USA after working for years in Britain and takes a nostalgic roadtrip through small town America. Yes, some of his humor and observations are sarcastic, but that's part of the fun. The reader has to understand the need for us to laugh at our idiosyncracies and inconsitencies. It's apparent that some reviewers here took offense instead of smiling, and a writer always runs that risk when using satire as a comedic device. Some folks are too insecure or just plain dull to enjoy it. If you have a sense of humor and don't feel threatened by the occasional parody, then you'll enjoy this book. If you can only take everything literally, stick to the newspaper.
B00000JZXJ|4.0|Plain and Simple: Must have for blues fans, this man started modern blues.  Sound quality of the album is not great, but it was recorded before people really knew how to make it great.
B000P2A256|3.0|I won't say this album is 5 stars for the simple fact that I doubt it will be enduring.  I decided to purchase the album after hearing Makes Me Wonder.  I don't know if I am the only one who thinks this way, but this album sounds real similar to the Police; too similar for my tastes.  Most of the tracks are decent however I tend to pass over they tunes where Adam goes into detail about how sexy he is.  I could care less about that, and it seems that he wants to remind me about it constantly.  I prefer lyrics with a little bit more meaning to them.  Regardless of how sexy he is, the album has some fun tracks that are worth playing at parties and while you drive around town.  Just don't let Sting hear them.

1591841666|1.0|OK, I keep buying Godin's books expecting more.  But, all I get is content that seems like a well constructed blog posting.  Seth is a very good writer and communicator, but this book added zero to my life.  It is a very short book about quitting stuff you're not good at and sticking with (or starting) things you're not good at.  Life is short.  The longer you dwell in mediocrity, the longer it will take you to become exceptional.  Contrary to the book's claim, it doesn't really teach you WHEN to quit or when to stick...other than when the goal is worthwhile.  Such an examination takes more than just reading some words.  There is very little thought-provoking content here.  It seems like a summarized rip-off of Marcus Buckhingham and the \\"strengths\\" books...which are excellent and unlike this book...may change your life.  Godin is well respected in marketing, but how many more collections of blogs (small is the new big), other people's works (purple cow), and short discourses about the obvious can he keep putting out?  It's like people who compile ezines.

0316018953|3.0|I am a huge fan of Michael Connelly's work and most especially the Harry Bosch series, so it pains me to ding (a bit) this newest effort.  First, let me tell you that like all Connelly's work it is a fast and pleasurable read.  Only this time a little too fast.  I read this in nearly one sitting, which is a little too light for me by far.  I also caught on to it a bit sooner than I ever have in a Hironymous Bosch outing, but that is neither here nor there. <br /> <br />I understand that series writers usually pare down their styles as they go along.  I've seen that with Jonathon Kellerman, Robert Crais, Loren Estleman and even the densest writer of them all, John Lee Burke.  But, although this is a timely (terrorism) and involving caper, with Harry being his normal pain-in-the-ay-self, it lacked much of the character complexity we usually get from Connelly. <br /> <br />He's a terrific writer, and one of the best of the modern LA writers, and Harry is a great character, so we can expect good stuff in the future.  I wouldn't pass this entry up and I'm sure fans will enjoy it, but one hopes for a bit more depth next time out. <br /> <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly started a little weak.  The folks at FOX decided to show the first three episodes out of order, so the back story came after the first one aired. The idea of a western in space, the Star Trek concept, was taken a little too far over the edge, with ships carrying cattle, and train robberies.  If flight is cheap enough to carry cattle, who needs a train? But a few episodes in, the overal story found the balance, allowing frontier CHARACTERS to exist in a future setting.  It was all gold from their, but FOX had already given up and killed the show before all the episodes aired.  This is more than a worthy buy. Tolerate the wierdness of episodes one through five and the payoff in the remainder is worth it!

B000LC4CVA|5.0|Great concert, deserve to collect.
B000J103PC|3.0|Streep, as always, is fabulous in her role but the rest of the plot is predictable, the characters unconvincing, and Anne Hathaway miscast in a role that is vapid. I wanted to know far more about Streep's character but was totally bored with the Hathaway cardboard character.   The movie reminds you of Working Girl but the comparison to the original suffers as Streep alone cannot carry this turkey.
B000002HH2|5.0|I can honestly say that as a bigtime music lover and longtime album collector that this album is by far one of my all time favorites and also what I consider Bjork's BEST album. She was in her prime when this album came out. Each song is diverse but melodic and catchy. The lyrics are beautiful. She pours out her heart and you feel the intensity. For other reviewers to compare her to Yoko Ono is like a kick in the chest. I'm sure these people own every Motley Crue album made to date. I understand that Bjork is an acquired taste but you cannot deny that she is an incredibly original and moving songwriter. Her albums that follow this album get more and more out there and although I still love her to death, I don't know if it's possible to make another album like this one. This album in my mind is 5 stars all the way and I've turned on many new bjork fans just by playing it. From start to finish it is a fantastic ride. If you never have experienced Bjork I highly recommend this album, even if you never buy another album from her again.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|1947's \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" has rightly been a Christmas favorite for years.  Frank Capra's classic movie carries the simple but powerful message that everyone can be a hero in their own lives, and no one is poor who has friends.<br /><br />The story features James Stewart as George Bailey, a banker in the small town of Bedford Falls.  Facing financial ruin on Christmas Eve, he comtemplates suicide.  His guardian angel, Clarence, gives him an opportunity to see his life as it might have been without him.  George, although hardworking, good-hearted, happily married, and modestly successful, has unluckily never had the opportunity to pursue bigger dreams outside Bedford Falls.  In the disturbingly dark alternate version of his life, we discover that George had a postive impact on a lot of people over the years, and without him, those lives went badly wrong.  In the end, George is offered the chance to return to his life as he has lived it, and discovers the true value of friendship.<br /><br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" features an exceptionally solid cast and crisp black and white cinematography.  Frank Capra's excellent direction carries us through the emotional gauntlet of George Bailey's painful voyage of discovery about the truth of his life. The feel-good ending will make the viewer appreciate his or her own Christmas as the annual small miracle it is.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a family Christmas movie on a par with the better versions of Dicken's \\"Christmas Carol.\\"
1416905014|5.0|Being a huge \\"CINDERELLA\\" fan, my niece bought this for ME for Christmas two years ago. Smart girl! (I'm an adult male in my early '40's). Needless to say, this stunning enchanted pop-up book was, hands down, my favorite gift that Christmas. It has earned a proud, distinquished place in my \\"CINDERELLA\\" collection of books and DVDS. We take this book out on special occassions, put it on a large table, and are still in awe of its beauty,  wonder, and magic.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam has continually put out great music despite their waning popularity after their third album (Vitalogy), but it seems that they only made a (sorta) comeback into mainstream awareness with the Avocado Album. <br /> <br />This album is very representative of what the band has completed thus far, summing up their dynamic style throughout the years in top form.  'Comatose' would feel right at home in Vitalogy, 'World Wide Suicide' in Vs., 'Inside Job' in Yeild, etc.  The haunting 53 second 'Wasted Reprise' injects a stunning, out-of-left-field dose of No Code into the album.  As well, this album continues Pearl Jam's tradition of singing about social issues and political ones (Marker in the Sand is a virulent attack on fundamentalist religion, World Wide Suicide against the Iraq War, Comatose I swear is about euthanasia), which is awesome as I almost always mirror their leftie views ;) <br /> <br />Established fans of Pearl Jam will adore this album, PJ gives what it does best here instead of going off on experimental tangents (which incidentally is very good too!).   I wouldn't recommend this album to newcomers to Pearl Jam, as they likely couldn't fully appreciate this album in the context of Pearl Jam's history.  For those beginners, no album is better than their outstanding debut, Ten.

B0009WFF7M|5.0|Others have commented on the band, the music, and even the surround sound. Since \\"Brothers in Arms\\" can be purchased in SACD or DualDisc (DVD-A), I thought I would offer a comparason between the two formats. Don't buy into \\"fanboys\\" who insist that SACD is the superior format. I am convinced that any significant differences between SACD and DVD-A are player-based. Some SACD players may sound better than a particular DVD-A player, and the reverse may also be true. In the case of \\"Brothers in Arms\\",The SACD was \\"resampled\\" from the same source as the DVD-A. In fact, the DVD-A MLP Lossless was basically a \\"direct transfer\\" at 96/24.    Here is what the people who actually mixed the surround versions had to say (as quoted in High Fidelity Review):    Thoughts on DVD-Audio and SACD Formats...    And now to the very end product: As touched-upon earlier, Bob Ludwig performed all the EQ in the digital domain from the PCM 96kHz 24-bit 5.1 Nuendo tracks at his extensive facility in Portland, Maine. This was basically just a digital transfer through his EQ and compression at 96/24 for the DVD-Audio version, but then he had to resample it for SACD.    \\"I think both the SACD and DVD-Audio products sound great,\\" enthuses [Chuck]Ainlay (credited for mixing the 20th Aniversary Edition). \\"However, from the purist point of view, I do prefer the 24-bit Meridian Lossless Packing (MLP) DVD-Audio (on the DualDisc) over the DSD hybrid-SACD version. On a previous Mark Knopfler album, `Shangri-La', we mixed to lots of different formats: We had a Nuendo session running 96/24; We also mixed to a DSD Sonoma system. Interestingly, as much as we had heard about how great DSD recording technology was, we nevertheless felt that it altered the sound to some degree, whereas the 96/24 LPCM was more representative of the original mix straight out of the console. In addition, we also mixed it to half-inch analogue tape at 30 IPS, as well as to 15 IPS, one-inch tape in two-track. And everyone in the room had the same opinion that the 96kHz 24-bit PCM was the closest representation of the console bus, and coming second was the 15 IPS one-inch analogue tape. Thereafter, it was a toss-up of which came in third and fourth - i.e. was it the Sonoma DSD, or the half inch 30 IPS tape? So going forward now, we have basically determined that we prefer 96kHz 24-bit PCM for recording over the Sonoma DSD. I was really surprised at that. I thought that I would like the Sonoma DSD recording the best, but after speaking with other people and Bob Ludwig himself - who is highly knowledgeable of DSD - we feel there is nevertheless is an inescapable `softening' effect which DSD imparts. To me this seems to emulate analogue to some degree, but is not necessarily the closest representation of the console output.\\"     So there you go. Since these discs are becoming increasingly rare (and expensive), you might want to just buy whatever is cheaper, assuming your player has the capability to play both SACD and DVD-A (which frankly seems to be the SACD, since this DualDisc is out of print). But if you want the closest representation of what the engineers heard in the studio, this is the version to get.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|I have given this three stars because I love the music, I love the singing and I hate the lyrics.  It definitely seems like Dave has an axe to grind with every country except the U.S.  I'm really growing weary of all the bands that use their music to express their political and religious views.  Dave does both here.  I've also had it with the concept albums built around the 911 attacks, Afghanistan and Iraq.  I listen to music to escape reality.  I wouldn't call Dave's views reality just his personal opinion.  If you like Ted Nugent's views you'll probably like this as well.  You could have done better Dave and the fans deserved better.
B000P0J02E|5.0|All the hype in recent weeks has been about the new summer blockbusters that are soon to be released, including the third installment of the Pirates trilogy.  Not to the realization of many people, music plays an absolute vital part to the success of a movie.  Hans Zimmer and his creative score for this movie will put At World's End above the other movies of the summer.  From the emotional new love theme presented in \\"At Wit's End\\" to the more recognizingly pirate-ish \\"Drink Up, Me Hearties\\", this epic story told alone by Zimmer's music will have you listening to each track over and over.  The full and powerful sound of the orchestra will suck you into the action and swashbuckling found in Verbinski's three unforgettable films.  ARRRRR!!

1582701709|1.0|The real secret:  Science mumbo-jumbo + a faith-based action plan = millions of dollars for the authors. <br /> <br />This book is a great example of pseudo-science.  The authors throw in quotes taken out of context, and, even worse, misrepresent actual science in order to support their mythical claims.  EX:  The author states that, according Einstein, \\"time is an illusion\\".  Huh?  One of Einstein's most famous theorems states that time is RELATIVE -- which is completely different than time being an illusion.  Don't be fooled - time is a reality.  <br /> <br />The authors describe this \\"Law of Attraction\\" as though it is an accepted, scientific force.  Not true.  The only scientifically tested forces in this universe are the Gravitational Force, Electromagnetic Force, Weak Nuclear Force, and Strong Nuclear Force.  That's it.  If the \\"Law of Attraction\\" is a universal law that all things must obey, and \\"like attracts like\\"....then how do you reconcile this force with the known Electromagnetic Force?  When you put the same ends of two magnets together what happens?  They repel.   So in order to accept the \\"Law of Attraction\\" as true, you must throw out the Electromagnetic Force.   Hmmmm...I guess lightbulbs turn on by faith, not force.      <br /> <br />The Secret's faith-based action plan ensures the method's success -- if \\"The Secret\\" doesn't work for someone, the authors can simply claim that the individual just \\"didn't believe strongly enough\\".   <br /> <br />While I do believe in the power of positive thinking and self-accountability, this book crosses a line between philosophy and science.  This type of thought (pseudo-science) is just as dangerous to our scientific process as intelligent design.  The lovers of \\"The Secret\\" may not be proponents of intelligent design,  but they are being duped in the same way.    <br /> <br />America's willingness to accept new mythologies as science is a scary trend that will simply ensure that America will fall behind other nations (China, India) in the most important area - actual science.
B000OONTFU|3.0|I was greatly excited to see that 'The Matrix' was finally coming to HD-DVD after I bought my player. When the box set arrived at my door, I ripped into it like a child on Christmas. However, I immediately noticed something fishy. While the three movies were in the normal red HD-DVD boxes, the two bonus disks (including the Animatrix and Matrix Revisited) were in a similar black box. Upon further inspection and testing I found that these discs were not HD-DVDs at all, but rather plain vanilla DVDs. <br /> <br />Before I reach my conclusion, let me say that the movies look absolutely wonderful on HD-DVD. I was blown away by how fantastic the first movie looked; it brought me back to the first time I saw the film in theaters. The sound is superb as well. The in-movie featurettes, which have grown to become my favorite HD-DVD feature, are available for all three films as well. <br /> <br />However, I have paid good money for a HD-DVD set that really isn't what I thought it was. Nowhere on Amazon or elsewhere was it stated that some of the disks were DVDs. I almost feel as if I deserve an apology.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|The 1974 Great Gatsby movie is a vivid portrayal of the book written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The movie follows the book fairly accurately, with only some deviations from the novel. Robert Redford (Gatsby) and Mia Farrow (Daisy) do an excellent job of representing their characters as described in the book. I was disappointed in the character representation of Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan, but was otherwise pleased with the actors. I liked the actress that played Jordan Baker and the actor that played Nick Carraway, and felt that they stuck to their characters as explained in the book. <br />The movie depicts the decade of the 1920s very well. From the costumes to the scenery to the cars, the 1920s is definitely alive in this movie. At Jay Gatsby's parties, you can really see the culture of the 1920s at its fullest. It is interesting to see the \\"flapper\\" girls and the Charleston dance steps. Even the hairstyles of the women highly parallel traditional 1920s styles. <br />I can't necessarily say that the movie was better than the novel, but then again, that is usually the case with movies made from books. I suggest reading the book first and watching the movie second to reinforce the knowledge gained by it. Overall, the movie is a strong and realistic portrait of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.

B00005JLXE|2.0|I assumed this movie would be generic but more than likely watchably entertaining. Turns out it's neither. It seems more british than american, the way it's edited to barely let you in on what's going on. The establishment and development of characters fits somewhere between slow and non-existant, and as if the premise of a blind superhero wasn't dumb enough the fight scenes seem specifically designed to induce laughter. By the halfway point the movie hasn't created any excitement or set up any plot points for you to anticipate the resolution of, something any decent action movie should do in the first 15 minutes.
1416914285|5.0|As a longtime fan of Cassandra Claire's fanfiction Draco Trilogy, I was thrilled to read her debut novel. Claire has a knack for creating characters that live long in your imagination. Jace is very similar to her fanon Draco but stands on his own as a terrific hero. Clary and Simon also are well-developed. I hope we get to learn more about Isabelle and Alec in the next book. <br /> <br />Claire also has a gift for description and it shows in her perfect blending of urban New York with a glamour of fantasy. I look forward to reading the next two books and am sure that Claire has a bright and brillant future as our newest urban fantasy author.

B000BKVQTS|3.0|Terry Gilliam has had a long-time rivalry with The Age of Reason, but while masterpieces like [[ASIN:0767809335 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]] let that rivalry dictate the form of the movie itself, this film has the attributes of that rivalry, with a French general and a Grimm who insist upon the rational, while a tracker and the other Grimm live in the world of fantasy, but in the end follows some rather standard formulas to complete itself.  Perhaps it was the effect of his failed movie based on _Don Quixote_, but it seems that Gilliam falls back a lot on standardization lately, providing Hollywood-esque endings that in the end are not satisfying because there seems to be much more at stake in the movie.<br /><br />The premise and the initial goings-on are fine enough--Will and Jake Grimm are a couple of sham artsists who go from town to town and do theatric trickery to 'exorcise' different towns...for a fee each time, of course.  But when they come across a German town where children have been disappearing (children with little, red hoods and names like Gretel, etc.), their trickery may have to be transform into an actual battle against magic.<br /><br />A biopic?  Please.  Gilliam has a wonderful way of be literate and transformative, taking liberty with the texts of Brothers Grimm fairy tales...or, to be more accurate, postulating a possible event behind their birth.  Heath Ledger and Matt Damon are quite good as the Grimms, and some Gilliam staple-actors do their usual fine work, but the movie itself doesn't present the kind of playfulness and depth that the best Gilliam films reach.<br /><br />But if he can still get work after the Quixote disaster, it lets him be in the game to make something else as fine as _Munchausen_ or [[ASIN:0780022181 Brazil - Criterion Collection]].  And if he gets some cred back with a rather standardly formatted movie, then let the man create.
0316018953|5.0|Since his first book, The Black Echo, Michael Connelly has been one of my favorite authors.  His intricate, suspense story lines coupled with his clear, concise writing style makes for wonderful reading.  He keeps Harry Bosch fresh and interesting with each new story, and keeps the continuity of the Bosch character intact as he updates Harry with the changing times.  In this quick paced story Harry must deal with Homeland Security, the FBI, and governmental politics as foreign terrorists supposedly steal nuclear material from a hospital.  Old friends make appearances and new characters are introduced as Harry skillfully figures out the hows and whys of this suspense thriller.  He is getting older now and is obviously nearing the end of the road but like an old friend I hope he goes on forever.  Thank you Mr. Connelly for keeping Harry with us a little longer. <br />Character development was superb.  This is Mr. Connelly's strong point in his dynamic writing style.  He keeps his characters real, fresh, and interesting by showing both their weaknesses and strengths.  He does a magnificent job of character continuity with flashbacks and previous story integration.  At times we know more about Harry than we want to but still want to know more.  That says it all. <br />No gratuitous violence, sex, or language.  The deductive reasoning Detective Bosch uses reminds one of Sir Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and is just as entertaining. <br />Must Read.  Only 225 pages so you will finish it quickly.  I read it in 2 nights. A quick page turner.  <br />P.S.  Don't miss the final added chapter on Michael Connelly's web site.  Although not needed to finish the book it is illuminating in where Harry is going next!!
B0009SOFFY|5.0|This has to be one of the hardest hitting albums ever released. The fact that it came out in 1970 is amazing, only confirming that the Stooges were ahead of their time. (This album pre-dated the punk movement of '77 by seven years.) Also confirming that \\"Fun House\\" was a work of genius is the fact that Elektra records dumped the Stooges from their roster after they released this album, which proves the theory that genius is rarely understood, accepted, or recognized in it's time and is only appreciated in hindsight. This album wipes the floor with what is considered \\"heavy\\" today, you put it up next to a band like Nickelback or another band in that genre and it makes the other band look emotionless and weak by comparison. The first three songs on this disc don't let up a bit, \\"Down On The Street\\", \\"Loose\\", and \\"T.V. Eye\\" are all relentless grooves that capture the Stooges throbbing rhythm section, buzzsaw guitar, and Iggy's over the top vocals and gutteral screams and yelps. (I once read Iggy's explanation of what the \\"T.V.\\" stands for in \\"T.V. Eye\\", and it doesn't stand for television, and thats all I can say on Amazon.) \\"Dirt\\" stands as one of the Stooges best slow songs, and doesn't lag for a seven minute dirge. The onslaught continues with \\"1970\\" which was later to be covered by many punk bands years later, most notably The Damned, who released it as \\"I Feel Alright\\" on their debut album. \\"Fun House\\" has one of my favorite Iggy vocals and a struttin' vamp of an arrangement by the band, including a honking sax. I can remember blasting it in college and having people walk by my door and asking, \\"What the hell's that noise?\\". \\"L.A. Blues\\" is like a free jazz blow out where the band implodes on itself. Unbelievable. This album sounds as fresh today as it probably did back then, and will remain timeless. It is amazing to me that the Stooges combined a punk attitude and aggressive music this way in the late sixties and early seventies, when hippies ruled the music scene. I spoke to a guy once who saw the Stooges live during this period and said it was the most inspiring thing he ever saw. If you are a rock fan and haven't heard this one, don't hesitate, just buy it. This disc never gets old and should be an essential for everyone's CD collection.ne.

B000002G0P|1.0|Let's face it; Extreme was really nothing more than a hair metal band; concerned more with appearance than with art. In fact, they were of the second generation of hair metal bands, which means they were really nothing more than an imitation of a hair metal band. I know, they had an amazing guitarist, but so did Dokken, White Lion, Ratt, and many others. Having a talented guitarist clearly would not exclude them from the characterization. Nuno, after all, had the prettiest hair of any of them. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm not giving Extreme enough credit. But I do give them credit for what they attempted to do with this album. It sounds like they were trying for a metal-sounding Beatles Broadway musical, which is quite an ambitious undertaking! Frankly, they weren't good enough to pull it off. <br /> <br />The album does have some redeeming qualities. The tone of the guitar is superb, Nuno's abilities definitely shine, and there are a few memorable songs, such as Am I Ever Gonna Change and Rest in Peace. Most of the other songs, however, are less memorable and really without much significance. The drummer plays fairly well, but the bassist is only average and can't really even be heard, and the vocals are terrible. I've never been impressed with the quality of Gary Cherone's voice and it's no more impressive here. Most of the lyrics are pretentious, intentionally abstract (as abstract as a hair metal band can be, I suppose), and ridiculous. <br /> <br />There are few bands that can pull off anything close to what the Beatles did. And, with or without having heard this album, it'd be hard to believe any proclamation that Extreme was a band who could.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Brendan A. stole my thunder (gee, I have a son named Brendan), so I'll keep mine brief.  I really enjoyed Wilco's Ghost, but there were only a few really memorable songs.  Ghost was strong musically, but not lyrically.  I find Blue Sky to be as almost as good musically as Ghost, but much stronger lyrically.  I look forward to the evolution of Wilco and to others in this genre (Radiohead, Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, the Shinns).  Keep up the good work.

0465011020|5.0|This is one of the few books that I was compelled to read through in one sitting. His personal accounts of the life in Yoduk concentration camp are vivid and almost too surreal to believe. Sadly the story didn't end with his release from Yoduk concentration camp or his subsequent flight to South Korea via China. There are still millions people suffering in various prison camps. In fact, the entire state of North Korea is a big prison camp. <br />   The worst part of the reality is that there are still people (though minority) who sympathize with North Korean regime. Unbelievably, there are still some people in the world who either idealize the North Korean government or help sustain the current regime. This book should help dispell any illusions associated with North Korea and compel us to help the suffering people there.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|I used to fluctuate between this and Blonde On Blonde - or the rougher, leaner sound of Highway 61 Revisited, but neither really captured the Dylan i could and do identify with the most. This is not to say that there are not *plenty* of other songs (some less popular, like \\"up to me\\" ) that i don't just love, the way i love the riff to East Laredo Blues, but on the whole, i have to say that it is this album that does what the title promises... it delivers... it brings it all back home and wow, what a wallop it packs.<br /><br />The set-list you can easily find here so i won't go through it all, but to miss this album would be to miss some of the classic Dylan and that would be to deny yourself just the chance to see whether or not you like this minstel or not.  You may decide not - but don't make that decision until you've at least heard this one.<br /><br />Dylan albums, like Dylan songs, are difficult to choose a \\"favorite.\\"  I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite Dylan song, but if i have to pick an album, and i admit this is tough, then this would be it.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />s.r.p.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Released in 1968, this album was the first without Syd Barrett as a full member of the band (he did write and perform on Jugband Blues and played slide guitar on Remember a Day however) and also provided a major impetus for a good portion of the German experimental rock scene; influencing a number of bands including electronica giant Tangerine Dream.  Although in some ways the product of a band getting used to a new lineup, I feel that this is still an excellent Pink Floyd album that has a great deal to offer any fan of progressive music.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included new member (and old friend) David Gilmour (electric and acoustic guitars; vocals); Rick Wright (mellotron, piano, organ, and vocals); Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals); Nick Mason (drums and percussion); and on Jugband Blues/Remember a Day, Syd Barrett (vocals, electric guitar; slide guitar).  Although Dave was never comfortable with his vocals skills at this point, I think he does a great job, as do all of the other members including Rick and Roger.  Dave was a little bemused by what his new bandmates were asking him to do with his guitar, and he found himself playing the instrument with pieces of wood, and making other odd noises.  The musical influences present on this album clearly indicate that the band was entering new territory and even Rick Wright started exploring his Stockhausen influences a bit further (especially on A Saucerful of Secrets).  As a side note, the band was using a quadraphonic sound setup during this early stage and surrounding their audience with the music, which was yet another nod to avant-garde electronic composers; in this instance the reference was to Edgar Varese.<br /><br />Musically, this album is a bit removed from the excellent debut album, and is a little darker in mood (if that can be imagined).  The album shows the band delving further into the electronic soundscapes that they would develop further over the next few years.  I think that the lengthy (11'57\\") A Saucerful of Secrets suite is an excellent example of this and brings together avant-garde electronic experimentation, Rick Wright's \\"celestial\\" and spacey organ chords with tiny modulations, and large scale form into one place.  Large scale composition is something that would develop further during the 1970s, and on this suite there is good use of dynamic range, and varying moods throughout.  There is also the meditative and somewhat menacing Water's piece Set the Controls for the heart of the Sun and two nice spacey psychedelic pieces loaded with mellotron by Rick Wright including Remember a Day and my personal favorite See Saw.  Corporal Clegg marks the beginning of Roger Water's increasing focus on his father's death in the war and features (I think) a few riffs on the guitar from Syd.  The truly odd track on the album is Syd Barretts' Jugband blues, which is a chaotic mix of the Salvation Army Band (he told them to play whatever they felt like playing), kazoo, and his penchant for asymmetric and surreal lyrics.  This would prove to be his last studio performance with the group.<br /><br />All in all, A Saucerful of Secrets is regarded by many folks as a weaker sophomore effort, although I feel that this is a pretty important album that demonstrates the direction the band would head in.  Highly recommended along with Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967); More (1969); Ummagumma (1969); Atom Heart Mother (1970); and Meddle (1971).y (11'57\\") A Saucerful of Secrets suite is an excellent example of this and brings together avant-garde electronic experimentation, Rick Wright's \\"celestial\\" and spacey organ chords with tiny modulations, and large scale form into one place.

B000NDIAWY|4.0|I instantly liked Brandi Carlile's \\"The Story\\" when I first listened to it, but it took a few turns through the CD player before I really started to appreciate the nuances of her unique and powerful voice that echoes Melissa Etheridge and most amazingly Patsy Cline.  Her music is a lively combination of folk, rock, and country.<br /><br />The CD works very well as a whole where there is no track you wish to skip over and the songs start to grow on you the more you listen to them.  Some of the more mellow ballads, however, could be dangerous to listen to while driving.  Carlile shines best when she broods and rocks like on Tracks 2 (The Story) and 4 (My Song) or when she aches and seethes like on Tracks 11 (Downpour) and 12 (Shadow on the Wall).<br /><br />Some of the lyrics leave you wanting more as they are often generically poetic or whimsical, and I imagine her voice will only improve with age and the grit of experience.  It's abundantly clear though that Carlile was born to be a musician, and her talent will surely continue to bloom in the future.
0553562355|4.0|Segal can write a cunning novel in so few words. In this book the gripping idea of a marriage rocked by the discovery that a single infedilty led to a child being born several years ago. With the death of the child's mother the father discovers the child, and struggles to combine his family under one roof. The ultimate question of what we would do, and what we can do to forgive those we loved is the heart of the matter here. Beautifully written as all Segal novels are.
0743289412|2.0|...even reading this lackluster bore-fest of a book.  It lacks really anything substantial, and, at times, the plot wanders so far away from Lisey that you have to wonder (her sisters).  Sure, there is King's pseudo-interesting, made-up language abound, but really, that's the only thing the book has going for it. <br /> <br />The first part of the book was somewhat heartfelt and sometimes endearing, which, we should contribute to King's 'wonderful elasticity' as an accomplished writer, but it proves far too mushy for my taste.  In fact, I have to pose the question: Did King even write the first few chapters?  I'll have to agree with another reviewer who attributed the first portion of the book towards a woman rather than King himself--he's far too much a product of his gore and straightforwardness by now. <br /> <br />Going back to the love: What happened to Lisey's (where does he come up with these names?) husband was by far awful and tragic to say the very least, but it's been two years, and we have to wonder if this poor widow has something mentally wrong with her.  Of course, there's a difference between 'moving on' and 'wanting to move on' but Lisey seems to transcend any hopes for the two: it's taken her two years to even sort through her husband's warehouse of written masterpieces, and she still lives in the same house.  She's a product of her own inability to transcend the limits of her role as a secondary female character; indeed, this whole story isn't even Lisey's story, but her husband's attempt to control her from death just as he controlled her in life. <br /> <br />I felt bad for Lisey, as Kind never let have a chance.  As another reviewer (perhaps the same one) put it: this novel is demeaning towards Lisey and all that she ever tried to stand for.  I lost interest quickly in this book because of all of this, and it's not at all subtle--in fact, this is pretty much evident from the beginning. <br /> <br />The plot is pretty much lacking, as well as King's ability to make anything progress.  It's boring, plain and simple.  I lasted for nearly half of the book before I had to throw it across the room due to boredom: I think I only let it have its run because King's name was on it.  But far less forgiving writers will probably only last until page 25 in this seemingly lackluster, failed epic from King.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|I've never been a big fan of remakes.  It seems to be particularly annoying with this one, since the main actor was also the one who starred in the original.  This would seem to make re-hashing this movie a pointless endeavour.  Why not just watch the original?  I find it hard to believe that so many other reviewers have said this is a good movie.
B000063V8R|5.0|This is a little bias because I am a star trek fan.  Love the Series!
B00005JPD0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was, with an extremely tight script and some great acting wrapped around what turns out to be a love story.  Denzel Washington is one of our best, and he shines here as the genial genius investigator tapped to hunt down a terrorist in New Orleans.  The only problem with the story is that it requires some focus from its viewers -- the pieces are all there, but the film never spoon-feeds the audience, which puts some people off. <br /> <br />Get over it. <br /> <br />The best science-fiction stories are love stories, and the best love stories are those where the main characters overcome impossible odds to be together.  What's more impossible than getting to know someone after they've died, then deciding to try to prevent their murder?  A truly intelligent story told by a gifted director with an excellent cast, what more can you ask? <br /> <br />It was sheer coincidence that I rented this DVD after re-reading a favorite Robert Heinlein novel where time travel was a dominant theme.  Heinlein wrote these type of stories with the same meticulous attention to detail that made his best novels so believable.  His \\"prime directive\\" in these matters was simple:  there are no paradoxes, just sequences of events that the characters (and the audience) don't understand until after it's over.  This story has a very Heinleinian flavor to it; Mr. Scott and Mr. Bruckheimer did their homework on this one. <br /> <br />There are a number of wonderful homages sprinkled throughout the film, not the least of which is to the City of New Orleans itself.  One scene in the final cut was remixed so the background audio wasn't clear; view the same scene in the \\"extended\\" features section and you'll hear the voice of Rod Serling (\\"Twilight Zone\\") coming over Claire's TV, right before events get hairy.  Very appropriate. <br /> <br />Even my wife, not a sci-fi fan by any stretch, loved this film and demanded to see it twice!  There is no strongerrecommendation than that.
0312305060|4.0|I enjoyed the reading of this novel immensely.  I usually read fiction with a goal of become deliciously lost within the narrative. This book did that but, while I usually don't look to appreciate prose as art unto itself, the prose and language in this book were crafted beautifully.  Some of the paragraphs are stunning.  The forward is an artistic achievement in that sense and hooked me into the rest of the book.  The stories of the book flow well enough for eager reading but this is also a message book.  The message is that all people's lives are dominated by the ordinary passage of each day but most us are consoled with the memories of the rare hours of our lives when everything clicks. When we are what we want to be and we see life as a green field before us.  Some people have more of those hours than others.  Some loudly pretend they do.   Most of us treasure a few and that's enough.
B000E5KJES|5.0|I can't say enough about how well this film turned out. This movie always has something going on in so many different circumstances, and draws you into such a sense of normalcy within a completely extraordinarily abnormal lifestyle.<br /><br />The story's narration plays uniquely well throughout the film. And the film seems to morph throughout its \\"life\\" in a very intelligent manner.<br /><br />Just about every frame of this film can induce positive in-depth discussion...too much to say in a single review - you really should just see this movie for yourself!<br /><br />The HD DVD transfer quality is outstanding! Visually compelling artistic sweeps coupled with production sets and performances that make you feel \\"right at home\\" give \\"GoodFellas\\" an unmatched sense of epic realism!<br /><br />There is a vertical mid-screen stripe of missing picture which runs from 1:16:37 to 1:16:42, but upon searching the internet before contacting Warner to ask if it's a disc issue, I find that it has existed since the original theatrical version and has also been present on every other format which the film has been released on so far as well. This does not break the movie by any means - some claim to have never noticed (I don't see how) - I'm just surprised that nobody has taken the time to sit down and interpolate what appears to be a simple fix for a five-second segment of the movie.<br /><br />The DD+ 5.1 audio track is very rich, clear and enveloping...it sounds remarkable, every bit!<br /><br />Extras include two commentaries, three cast and crew documentaries, a storyboard-to-screen comparison and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />This is a top quality, amazing two hour and twenty-five minute film. I so highly recommend \\"GoodFellas\\".

0316010669|5.0|This book is about: rapid cognition, non-linear thinking, structure of spontaneity, intuition, verbal overshadowing, sensation transference, mind-reading, mind-blindness, the dangers of a heart rate of more than 175 beats per minute and much more. But don't let that stop you from reading this book. These items are served to you in a series of diverse and instructive stories that could be useful to you in your everyday life.    Most of the instruction is about positive things like how to better manage potential heart attack cases and fight wars more effectively. With regard to heart attacks, however, there was a negative story. It was about how sensation transference was used to market margarine. But I overlooked author's choice of Imperial Margarine as an example and gave him five stars nevertheless.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I have to start by saying that, in my opinion, Shaun of the Dead is one of the funniest English comedies ever. The tag line says it all \\"A romantic comedy, with zombies\\". It starts out with our hero (of sorts) drudging through his very ordinary, boring life. His ever trusty sidekick best friend is only more than happy to coast along with him as long as he doesn't have to do anything. After a forgetful snafu, he looses his girl. While all this is going on, he fails to realize the world around him is changing. For the rest of the movie he is trying to get to his favorite pub for refuge, battle zombies and his ex-girlfriend's acidic friends and get her back. The humor is nonstop and at times can be very subtle as with most British movies. If you want a good romantic comedy that won't put you to sleep, I highly recommend this movie. I call it the ultimate anti-chick flick chick flick.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" I would obviously be a tremendous fan of a band of Cream's magnitude.<br /><br />If you want to call their first go around \\"Power Trio\\", \\"Supergroup\\", or both you would be correct.  Jack Bruce had a voice that could mesmerize a nation and their ability to improvise was nothing short of spectacular.  The London subway walls were filled with admiration (Alright it was graffiti) for Eric's solos, Ginger's unique style, and Jack's thunderous bass-lines.<br /><br />Cream could take the 5 minute tune and even when it reached 18 minutes you still would hang on every note.<br /><br />The brief reunion tour was a bit different in their approach.  You didn't have 20 minute jams and they played the songs closer to what a Derek & The Dominos show would be but to be able to experience the three of them on stage again is well worth the shorter improvisation and less intense solos.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  Jack Bruce can be proud of his voice to this day and when you watched him play the bass, men and women half is age feel far inferior.  Ginger may have held back a bit on the drums but in no way did he detract from the pure joy of the reunion.<br /><br />The songs for the most part were what you thought.  A fanatic like myself would have liked something out of the blue such as \\"Those Were The Days\\" or \\"What A Bring Down\\" but I was too busy sitting on top of the world during the festivities.<br /><br />For the younger fan see why they were \\"The Cream.\\"  For us old folks, we can feel a bit more youthful.<br /><br />Be well always,<br /><br />Craig Fenton<br /><br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"

B00005JOHC|5.0|Most of my friends who have seen this show wouldn't think twice before they concurred: it's flat out hilarious. I had my reservations about Charlie Sheen in a role not unlike his cameo at the tail-end of [[ASIN:B0000AGQ24 Spin City]]--a suave yuppie and a consummate Lothario--but he is the delight of this party! Few can fit so snugly in the role of a relaxed, affluent young retiree lounging in his Malibu seafront apartment when he's not effortlessly schmoozing with the opposite gender. He's at his wry sharpest.<br /><br />There's excellent chemistry between him and Jon Cryer, who plays his uptight, righteous elder brother. As they tackle mature subjects such as frivolous relationships and artificial insemination and pretty much everything that surrounds this nature of things, the brother's smart-mouthed son is kept ever so cleverly in the dark. These parallel tracks of young and old humor lend the show some sparkling dimensions. The little boy, Angus Jones, is a natural. Some of us may have seen him at the Emmy Awards last year. An outspoken housekeeper, a domineering mother, and a cutting curmudgeon of an ex-wife round out an ensemble cast; any episode featuring Holland Taylor's portrayal of a prim and proper modern-day mom of the two brothers in her crisp Chanel skirts and bright red lipstick can almost guarantee a laugh-riot.<br /><br />The true hallmark of a successful sitcom is the degree to which you end up warming up to its characters. Amidst its spate of one-liners, 2&1/2 Men does a fairly decent job of making viewers relate to its characters. None of these archetypal characters is new, but each is idiosyncratic without being wildly over-the-top. There are even some touching episodes such as the one when Charlie's favorite neighborhood girl sets off to a distant destination, leaving his supposedly wooden heart all aflutter.<br /><br />If the recent drought of funny shows on TV is any indication, sitcoms are no cakewalk. There have only been a handful of the truly funny ones that did not run out of steam in their later days and kudos to the scriptwriters for making 2&1/2 Men belong plushly in that elite league! I must say I am not pleased with the damage that this 'introductory price' may wreak on your wallet, but that's a minor quibble for a DVD you know you're going to be watching more than once.truly funny ones that did not run out of steam in their later days and kudos to the scriptwriters for making 2&1/2 Men belong plushly in that elite league!

B000004747|5.0|This CD combines two of Roland Kirk's most celebrated albums, one volcanic, the other luscious.  Rip, Rig and Panic is renowned because of the astounding line-up, Jaki Byard on piano, Richard Davis on bass, and the redoubtable Elvin Jones kickin' skins.  (Jones has never sounded better.)  The other, Now Please Don't You Cry, Beautiful Edith, sounds like lounge jazz by comparison.  The lineup is strong, but simply not in the same league as Rip, Rig and Panic.  Still, the album contains some of Rahsaan's most appealing work, including the title track.  In this respect it provides listeners, especially, newcomers, a good overview of the diverse landscapes of Rahsaanapolis.<br /><br />This said, it would require a truck equipped with extra heavy-duty suspension to deliver the box set providing a comprehensive tour of Rahsaanapolis.  Kirk was a man of profound contradictions, relentless experimentation, and an unquenchable appetite for music.  He has been largely overlooked by jazz historians (to say nothing of the public!) and unfairly tagged as a novelty act because of his propensity for playing multiple horns simultaneously and actually making his own reed instruments out of bits and pieces of other reed instruments.  Rock producer Billy Graham once said of Kirk, \\"He wasn't just angry, he was Nina Simone angry.\\"  True, and yet he was capable of playing music so fragile and beautiful it might reduce a serial killer to tears - check out I Talk With The Spirits.<br /><br />One of Kirk's many contradictions was that, despite his intense need to push music into uncharted territory - frequently in several directions at once - listening to him was always a Master's Class in music history.  No jazz musician has ever been so aware of his roots, or anxious to share them with you.  Who else could take you from Sidney Bechet, Don Byas, and Fats Waller all the way to Burt Bacharach and Hal David - and have the trip make sense?  At one point in the breathtaking album Rahsaan Rahsaan, Kirk says, \\"Thank you, Bird\\" in such a casual, comfortable tone of voice it's as though Charlie Parker had just left the room.  In a sense, that's exactly what did happen, because the musicians Kirk studied came alive in his music, in his respect for them and in his confidence as he interpreted them and developed their ideas.<br /><br />It's tempting to point out that Kirk was blind, and perhaps, like others before him, his stunning ear was partly attributable to this.  But for Kirk, a heightened ability to listen was only the starting point.  Kirk played everything he touched, and he played with unparalleled intensity.  His flute playing was memorable, but his tenor sax work was simply off the map.  Kirk belongs in the pantheon with Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Eric Dolphy, and John Coltrane - indeed, he's already there, it's just that the mainstream hasn't noticed yet.  I'm not aware of any Rahsaan Roland Kirk CD that isn't worth the price of admission, but for veterans and first time visitors to Rahsaanapolis alike, this CD is especially select.hsaan, Kirk says, \\"Thank you, Bird\\" in such a casual, comfortable tone of voice it's as though Charlie Parker had just left the room.

B000050FEN|5.0|When I first saw this movie I took the phrase \\"JAW-DROPPING\\" as an understatement. Mainly, becasue this was the first movie that by the end my jaw was on the floor. Everything about this movie flows effortlessly, the mood of the film, the acting is superb, and the ending couldnt have been better. Anyone who has not seen this movie is doing themselves a disfavor. David Fincher is a talented director, his vision and direction for this film is untouchable, ingenious, and  exquisitely clever. The story unfolds like a blanket, as far as thriller's go this is the best one I've ever seen. The screenplay is well-written, and in my opinion should've been nominated for an Academy Award, along with the movie itself.  <br /> <br />The casting for the film couldn't have been assembled no better. Morgan Freeman... well its Morgan Freeman, what can you say but living legend. Brad Pitt, who I am not a big fan of, outdid himself in this movie, this one of his best roles. Even If I tried I couldn't find not one thing bad about this movie. Kevin Spacey crafts the role as John Doe to perfection. He was only in the movie for about 20 -25 minutes, and boy did he make his presence known.  <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to any and everyone. I can guarantee once you've seen it, you'll watch it over and over again, changing the way you look at movies forever.
B00000JR2A|5.0|Tears For Fears is an honest and poetic band bar none.  The writers are skilled, well-intentioned, and know how to produce and arrange a full, multi-satisfying genre of music in their own right.  Only bands like the Beatles and Seal have been able to compel me in so much with their well-produced, orchestral talent.   <br /> <br />Needless to say I would recommend this band and especially, this album to move a spirited thirst for those who appreciate excellent writing, rich vocals, and lyrics that capture all of a listeners soul.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble's charm is that he can take a previously recorded song and make it his own.

B00005JPRT|5.0|Saw the movie yesterday, when it opened in our local theater.  Decided this morning that I needed to look for the soundtrack.  Have signed up to be notified when the movie becomes available, because it's that good.<br /><br />I'm not a movie critic, but this one is good enough that I want to encourage other folks to see it.  It's hard to explain the reasoning without giving too much detail about the story, or building it up too much.  But here's what I can say :<br /><br />During the movie, I recognized that I was waiting for some tragic event (my wife said as we left the theater that she kept waiting for one of them to die), because that's what would happen in a standard Hollywood movie.  How sad that we've grown accustomed to movies that must throw big tragic events at us to create emotional responses because the acting, storywriting, and character development cannot suffice to make us feel emotions on a small scale.<br /><br />In \\"Once\\", the acting and the story (and the music) develop the characters well enough, and tell a story that is plausible enough, that an ordinary tragedy is sufficient to make the viewer feel genuine and complex emotion.  All without trying too hard or backing away from it.  That's brilliant.  Worth seeing more than once, which is why I want to own it.
0765316978|4.0|John Scalzi's trilogy (Old Man's War, etc.) has finally come to an end with The Last Colony. The characters are alive, in the way that we've come to expect from Scalzi. The banter between \\"90-year-old dad\\" and \\"teenage daughter\\" is cute and funny, and if you have a teenaged daughter it rings true, especially if your daughter is smart and funny and quick. Scalzi's politics makes sense too, and his description of the galaxy can be read as an interesting discussion of the way the rest of the world views the United States at the end of the first decade of the 21st century. And maybe not. You can read the book and ignore the political subtext, and the book reads like a good old fashioned space yarn in the tradition of RAH, whose centennial is this year.    Scalzi's writing and his book is a far better memorial to Heinlein than the book Spider Robinson wrote last year, from material found by the Heinlein Estate.    You should buy Scalzi and read Scalzi because he is a terrific writer, and is one of the most direct literary inheritors of the Master, Robert A. Heinlein.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Sadly, I had to wait nearly 3 weeks for my CD to arrive from Amazon - the longest I've ever had to wait for an item bought here, even though I do live in Oz. During that time I had plenty of opportunity to read and hear the thoughts of hundreds of others who had already been blessed with this new Rush recording. Most of the reviews were balanced and mature, some though were childish and unwarranted IMO. So, was it worth the wait for me? Oh hell yes!    I have been a Rush fan since the late 70s, have every release, as well a sizable memorabilia collection. I pretty much live and breathe Rush, so I was waiting with much anticipation to finally hear this CD that some had canned whilst most obviously (and understandably) love. I am in the latter group of course. I think masterpiece is still too much of an understatement. Rush music has always been prog rock for the thinking man, so it doesn't surprise me in the least that those without brains cannot appreciate what is once again a wonderfully crafted and creative album from this unique trio of musicians.    As my title suggests, this is new Rush, yet old, classic Rush - classic Rush, yet wonderfully vibrant and totally refreshing in its approach. The most important thing to remember is that first and foremost, this is a RUSH album. They have never tried to be anything other than the honest and talented musicians they are, and with Snakes & Arrows the music and creativity is definitely honest and undeniably talented. I can hear all the nuances that made Rush who they are, but the sound whilst being uniquely Rush has also progressed, as good prog music should, and of course, you cannot be a fan of a progressive rock group and not progress with them.    Always ahead of their time with a musical maturity beyond their years, Rush have once again risen to the task and created what I can only describe as a concept album for the new millennium. There is definitely a theme linking every song, though perhaps a little more subtlethan those which flavoured 2112, Kings, and Hemispheres etc. which Snakes & Arrows can stand alongside with the pride it deserves.    It's a fresh album with a classic sound, a return to their roots with a renewed zest. New but old...old but new, and for me, the top 3 jewels in this priceless crown are Armor & Sword, The Way The Wind Blows and Faithless. These 3 songs could find a place on any of the 3 classic albums I mentioned above. The rest of the album follows a very close second.    For me, there is no weak link on Snakes & Arrows. All 13 tracks are classics in their own right, as you would expect from a band who understands fully the definition of the term.

0345350499|5.0|In reading customer reviews, I'm not surprised that much has been made regarding the tension between paganism and Christianity that drives the novel's plot.  However, I found the tension between female characters to be a more interesting device.  Marion Zimmer Bradley does an excellent job highlighting how jealousy and fear can impact and color our perceptions and motives.  The author explores how women achieve and maintain power in a male-dominated society--and their actions (like their male counterparts) are rarely sweet and pretty.  Aside from the tried-and-true plot line, it is the well-drawn characters themselves that make this book a joy to read.
0007205236|5.0|I avoided this book for two reasons. The hype. More often than not I am disappointed by highly-hyped books and movies. And, I thought it would depress and exhaust me. But as with Betty Smith's A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, you become so engrossed with the characters that you aren't weighed down by the crushing poverty. It almost seems an afterthought, a tiny detail, yet it is what forms the characters. Both of these books, while written 60 years apart, are written beautifully and skillfully.

B000286RKW|5.0|Goodfellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990)<br /><br />I hated Casino when I went to see it back in 1995. I now understand why; Casino was Scorsese's attempt to remake Goodfellas, but like Brian DePalma attempting to remake Curtis Hanson's L. A. Confidential in The Black Dahlia, the later film ended up somehow being both a shadow of the original and, if unintentionally, a parody of the original as well. Everything about Casino that ended up awful was fantastic in Goodfellas.<br /><br />Based on Nicholas Pileggi's autobiography, Goodfellas follows three guys--Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), and Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)--who all want to be mobsters. (Granted, as Tommy is the only Italian in the bunch, they don't have much of a chance.) From the outside, we're perfectly aware that they, and their band of assorted outlaws, are mostly comic relief for the actual made men in the area; they're well-meaning, but usually either not forward-looking enough when planning things, or simply inept. But they're exceptionally-drawn, all three of them perfectly-done pictures of what my in-laws are wont to call \\"bags of neuroses\\". We, as the viewers, are alternately amused and horrified by their doings. Meanwhile, when they're not out doing flunky jobs for the mob or trying to get ahead with side jobs of their own, their private lives are even more of a mess. It stands to reason that even the most thick-headed flunky will eventually get tired of riding on someone else's coattails and find some way to push the envelope. When it happens, it's pure screen magic. Then comes the denouement, and Scorsese proves himself a master of pace--the denouement is longer than the buildup, and if anything, even more compelling, as the three of them take different directions towards either redemption or self-destruction.<br /><br />Simply put, an amazing piece of moviemaking. If you haven't seen it, do. **** ½
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Clutch is Awesome.  That's all there is to it. They always manage to bring something new and interesting to the table.  And they continue to do so here on \\"From Beale Street to Oblivion.\\"  I don't think I have ever NOT liked a Clutch record, and as long as they keep staying true to themselves and play music they're passionate about instead of worrying about having a hit single I think I will never NOT like one of their records.  It's true, this one is more mellow, but there is nothing wrong with that.  If they kept it turned up to ten all the time they'd turn into a band like AC/DC, sure they write catchy rocking songs, but there's no surprise or adventure there.  Not so with Clutch.  Every song, every new album is a surprise, you basically never know what you're going to get.  Much like Forest Gump's oft quoted box of chocolates.  A great record to listen to while driving, especially during those long, hot, summer days.  If you just got into Clutch and are more into their heavier material you may not like this all that much, but if you give it a chance I think you'll find it's hard not to like it.  Just good music from a bunch of talented, passionate guys.  I hope they never stop.

0385043805|5.0|I read Rebecca first as a teenager. I couldn't put it down. After I finished it the first time I was monumentally annoyed that after reading a book I loved I could not remember the name of the heroine. I sat there racking my brain, so I thumbed through it looking for it. The next thing I knew I was reading it again. I became so enthralled with it the second time that I forgot I was looking for a name. I read that book THREE times before (remember I was a teenager!!) I realized she simply did not have a name! Who on earth would write a book and not give the main character a name?!?! That was part of duMaurier's genius. Now that I am older (MUCH older) and I recommend this book, I warn my friends about that, because our patience is thinner as we age and such a perceived 'memory loss' could be quite unsettling!! It's testament to her skill as a writer, you didn't even realize it as you read, so caught up in the story, as you are. It's not until after you have finished it and are thinking back over it.<br /><br />You are not a book lover if you have not read Rebecca.
B000P2A256|4.0|I tend to shy away from top 40 music, but Maroon 5's singles grabbed me like everyone else. I ended up buying the cd and it was a favorite for awhile. I had pretty much forgotten the band even existed until finally hearing about a new disc. I became excited since really had enjoyed the disc back in the day. <br />To me this new one is another breath of fresh air. It is shiny ear candy that provides enough danceability and hooks to satisfy any music fan, yet thankfully is not insultingly braindead and calculated like so much pop these days. It is really a perfect summer cd and it is the kind of album that alot of people will think about nostalgically in 20 years. We need more pop music of this caliber!

Then I checked IMDB, and found that Gaghan (Abandon) was the guy who wrote the screenplay for Steven Soderbergh's loathsome adaptation of the much better TV miniseries Traffik. Yeah, I didn't get that, either. I readily admit that I liked Syriana a whole lot better, but it does follow the same pattern-- there are a whole lot of people doing a whole lot of stuff in a relatively short timeframe, with the unavoidable side-effect that you don't spend anywhere near enough time with the various characters to develop any sort of empathy for them (or, for what it's worth, apathy). Some of the performances are good, some are excellent, but each of those-- especially George Clooney's much-lauded performance-- just left me wondering how good the movie could have been had it found a focus at any point during its two hours. I know I'm very much in the minority on this, but I didn't like it. **

0061120073|5.0|I read \\"Joy In The Morning\\" as a teen, but this one just didn't make my reading list until now, in my 40s. What a great book. I had just finished reading Angela's Ashes and I'd thought, that even though the books are 60 years apart, and one was written by a man about a boy, and the other by a woman about a girl, they were quite similar.<br /><br />They both drew me in and held me. It's incredible to me when an author can touch on something as unpleasant as poverty but not weigh you down and depress you with it. You aren't horrified by it and unable to finish it, and you aren't gobbling it up for morbid thrills as if staring as you pass by the scene of an accident. You come to admire the characters, and dread the last page.<br /><br />This is one that will always be on my shelf.
0609610570|3.0|After reading this book I realized that these authors were lamenting the same point found in the hundreds of other business books I've read over the years. That the so called \\"Management Talent\\" isn't really talent after all. It is just goals, plans, action, and perseverance. Since the vast majority of people, even in business, don't do this or at least not consistently makes those that do seem like exceptional managers. <br /> <br />I marginally liked this book. I agree with one reviewer that this is just a case study on project management.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The Illusionist (Neil Burger, 2006)<br /><br />I get the feeling that the principal dividing line in the very mixed reviews The Illusionist has garnered falls squarely in the province of whether you saw the end coming. I didn't, ad I liked it a great deal.<br /><br />Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is an illusionist. In flashback, we find out that as a young boy, he had a relationship with a girl well outside his station before the two of them were forcibly separated; fifteen years later, he returns to Vienna as an accomplished magician, and catches the eye of Leopold, the crown prince (Dark City's Rufus Sewell). Who is Leopold's betrothed? The same woman, of course, Sophie (Jessica Biel). Eisenheim and Sophie make advances toward picking up where they left off, but of course there's royalty in the way. Leopold gets his pet policeman, inspector Uhl (Sideways' Paul Giamatti) to investigate Eisenheim. You know this will not end well.<br /><br />The film is complex, and quite pretty to boot. Burger (Interview with the Assassin) has all his ducks in a row here, and knows where to place them for maximum effect. There are some weak points, of course, but surprisingly, Biel isn't one of them; this is easily her best performance since Ulee's Gold a decade ago. There seemed a few places where the script was rushed, as if the director had wanted to spend more time investigating certain plot tangents, and it's usually the case that doing so makes for a stronger movie, but those are pretty easily overlooked. A very good movie, well worth the cost of a rental (even at today's insane prices). *** ½
B000KCHZK6|5.0|The whole album is great. When you buy a Norah Jones album it's like buying a Beatle's album, most of the songs are really good and at least 6 songs are really great. <br />My favorites in order are: <br />1)Until the end, 2)Not too late, 3)Thinking about you, 4)Not my friend, <br />5)Wake me up, 6) Broken, 7)My dear country, 8) Little room. <br />She is the most talented writer and musician out there. She is soulful with her singing, soulful playing the keyboard or piano and she is naturally beatiful.  <br />

B0002DB52M|4.0|Dogville (Lars von Trier, 2003)<br /><br />Lars von Trier has always been, if nothing else, ambitious in the breadth and scope of his films. A quick look at The Kingdom should show that. And Dogville is nothing if not ambitious--a movie whose entire set is a huge chalkboard with lines delineating buildings, a small scattering of props, and a small, controlled stable of top-notch actors. How much can you do with such a minimal setup? Enough to fill a three-hour movie, apparently. And while Dogville isn't the best movie I've seen this year-- hell, it's not the best movie I've seen this week (that honor would have to go to Neil Jordan's fantastic The Butcher Boy)-- but it does its job, and it does it very, very well.<br /><br />Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a woman on the run from gangsters who stumbles into the ramshackle town of Dogville, Colorado. She is found by Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), the town thinker, and he decides to invite her into the close-knot town. After a town meeting, the others decide to give her two weeks, and see if she fits in. She goes to work for them, helping each family in town for an hour a day. As time goes on, however, their demands get stranger and more perverse, and Grace begins to realize that this town, who originally weren't sure if they wanted anything to do with her at all, is now unwilling to let her go...<br /><br />von Trier's set design, which has absolute zero in the way of eye candy, distances the viewer and forces him to concentrate on the actors and their relationships. At times, this can be, well, not the blessing it initially sounds, as all the ugliness at the heart of the town comes out. Because of this, there are parts of the movie than will probably be difficult to watch for those who lack strong stomachs. On the other hand, there's nothing to distract from the caliber of the performances; with a cast that includes Stellan Skarsgard, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Ben Gazzara, Udo Kier, Lauren Bacall, and, of course, Kidman and Bettany (and I'm just touching the tip of the iceberg), you can see how such an approach certainly has its upside as well.<br /><br />A great deal has been made of the anti-American sentiment in the film, but I tend to agree with those critics who see the underlying morality of Dogville in a more universal sense; of course it applies to current-day America (and, distressingly, it applies more now than it did at the time of the film's release), but to jump from that to assuming it applies only to America would be a grave mistake. People with the mindset of those in Dogville can be found anywhere, and in any time period; von Trier may not have set out to make a universal film (though for all I know, that's exactly what he intended), but that's how it came out.<br /><br />I admit, once I realized the entire film was going to be shot on the same set as the prologue, I despaired at my ability to stare at chalk outlines for three hours, but I ended up far more impressed than I expected to be. It's a hard film, but a powerful one nonetheless. *** ½dman and Bettany (and I'm just touching the tip of the iceberg), you can see how such an approach certainly has its upside as well. <br /> <br />A great deal has been made of the anti-American sentiment in the film, but I tend to agree with those critics who see the underlying morality of Dogville in a more universal sense; of course it applies to current-day America (and, distressingly, it applies more now than it did at the time of the film's release), but to jump from that to assuming it applies only to America would be a grave mistake.

0552550299|5.0|This book is not for simple-minded children! It is for young adults and cranky senior citizens and everyone in between who is eager to read a fresh take on an old genre; the genie book.  Nathaniel is a lot like the Mickey Mouse character from The Sorceror's Apprentice segment of Fantasia; he is treated cruelly by his master and seeks to control magic on his own without the help of an adult.  The results make for an entertaining and dark tale, one which will have you shaking your head in disbelief as the consequences of bad choices are made clear.  The narration by Bartimaeus is cynical and laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B00005JPAO|5.0|This is an absolutely enthralloing movie with superb acting.  The movie depicts very human people in practically impossible circumstances.  Like any other public figures, the Royal Family is subject to incredibly intense scrutiny.  The need to balance their obvious disdain for Princess Diana, with the need to put on a grieving face for the Nation and world was clearly very difficult.  The Oscar that Mirren won was very well-deserved.  She is simply phenomenal in this movie.  I had to remind myself on numerous occasions that I was watching a movie and not peeking into the private lives of the actual parties involved.<br /><br />Tony Blair was also depicted in a heroic sense in that he allowed the Queen to succeed in a very difficult time while he played puppet master in the background.  Excellent acting, excellent story, and an overall excellent movie.  This is a movie not to be missed.  5 solid stars!
0618680004|4.0|The chapter of The God Delusion that I enjoyed the most was chapter 7, \\"The 'Good' Book and the Changing Moral Zeitgeist.\\"  Dawkins dissects various stories in the Bible (Noah's Ark, Abraham sacrificing Isaac, the golden calf, etc) to prove that many portions of the Bible show dubious morals, and that moral theologians do not base their morality on the Bible, but pick and choose examples of morality from the Bible based on the morality they acquire from some other source.  While this portion of the chapter made for very entertaining reading, I felt that Dawkins could have ended the chapter more effectively.  He ended with his explanation of why it was not atheism that led Hitler and Stalin to commit acts of evil, but he spent more time than necessary proving that Hitler was not in fact an atheist; I thought it would have been more effective if he hard argued from the angle of assuming that both were atheists, and proving why that still made no difference in their decisions. <br /> <br />One of Dawkins' best examples was the example of \\"cargo cults\\" in chapter 5.  Indigenous people on islands in the Pacific noticed that the white people who came to them as missionaries received \\"cargo\\" from ships and airplanes, and saw no practical use in any of the white men's' activities (shuffling papers, etc), so they naturally came to the conclusion that these activities were religious in nature.  This led many groups to independently create religions centered on messiahs who would bring cargo.  The example is effective because it shows events that have happened within the last century, and how easily a new religion can form.  It also shows how reasonable an erroneous idea can seem to people when they have no additional information and provides an eerie similarity to Christianity: when a follower of the cult of John Frum was asked why after nineteen years he still expects Frum to return, he said \\"If you can wait two thousand years for Jesus Christ to come an' 'e no come, then Ican wait more than nineteen years for John\\" (205). <br /> <br />To me, Dawkins' most interesting point was the one he made about children.  He claims that there is no such thing as a \\"Catholic child\\" or a \\"Muslim child\\" or a child of any other religion; there can only be children of Catholic parents, children of Muslim parents, etc.  His point is valid: children are not yet old enough to know which religion they prefer.  However, rather than being part of his argument that religion should not exist, this seems to be a separate argument that children should not be brainwashed to join particular religions, and should be allowed to choose their own.   <br /> <br />My hope for this book is that moderate religious people will read it and see it as a call to action to make sure their voices are strong, that they do not harbor dangerous fundamentalism, and that they recognize that the most important thing to teach children is to ask questions and always doubt - if children then abandon the faith of their parents, their hearts were never in it from the beginning.

B000LXHK2C|3.0|I'm not sure why this movie is called \\"A Good Year.\\"  It really focuses on about a weeks worth of activities in a run-down French vineyard estate.  Max Skinner (Russell Crowe), a \\"take no prisoners\\" bond trader, inherits a French vineyard.  Coming off a deal that profited his company by $77 million, he had to cut his celebration short in order to sign some papers in France giving him the title to this property (that he only wanted to sell, sell, sell).<br /><br />[Note:  For an executive who believed that time was money, why didn't he send a lawyer in his stead?  It's done all the time.]<br /><br />Of course, he finds dirt, real people, and the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.<br /><br />Russell Crowe plays a great amateur \\"gentleman farmer.\\"  His best performance is as a roll-up-your-sleeves, let's-get-dirty, hard-working guy.  But he was SUPPOSED to be a tough-nut trader, with no calluses on his hands, perfect manicures, and a testosterone-loaded Armani wardrobe.<br /><br />Who was this other guy?<br /><br />So:  Crowe as a bond trader and jerk.  Ho-hum performance.  Crowe as a wannabe grape grower.  My favorite part!<br /><br />As a side note, I never understood the thing with scorpions and lavender.  Lavender may be repellent to scorpions, but if there were that many scorpions around, folk should be running into them all over the house and in the yard, and not just in a second-floor bedroom!  'Nuff said.  Hope the characters shook out their shoes every morning.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|I have to wonder if some of the newer acts that are just now catching up to what Patton has done in the past, will have his staying power.  The Patton led Faith No More was doing Lincoln Park before most people heard that blend of rock/hip hop/rap fusion.  Patton continues his mastery here.  While he continues to grow as an artist, other acts and fans will eventually catch-up and realize how ahead of his own time Patton is.<br /><br />I am still trying to get over sweet little Nora Jones and her risque contribution to this CD.<br /><br />Great fun and a strong 4 stars.
B0000DJZ8R|3.0|In an emotionally stunning and perpetually twisting depression-era tale of survival and perseverance, this classic film adapted from historic author John Steinbeck delves into the lives of the tired and weary Joad family as they make their way from their recently relinquished farm in Oklahoma to the promising orange fields of California. As we watch their journey unfold, we witness just how emotionally and psychically demanding their campaign for a better life becomes while the lives of those around them are simultaneously affected at a similar cost.<br /><br />The film stars legendary screen actor Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, a recently paroled convict coming home only to find that his once promising dream of re-acquaintance and celebration are marred by an open and desolate field of depression. Banks have been ordered to collect any salvageable assets during this economic hardship, thus using landowners and the companies that employ them to drive sharecroppers from their leased properties. I viewed the film in an edited form in my Modern American History class, starting at Scene 4 and watching up to a scene in which we witness the death of Grandma Joad (played dramatically by Zeffie Tilbury).  Award-winning actress Jane Darwell and John Carradine as Casy stand out as the more memorable of this immediate cast of tireless crusaders in a time of drought and migration.<br /><br />I feel Nunnally Johnson did a great job in adapting this film from Steinbeck's version, which I had read in high school a few years previous.  Few moderate changes were made, notably the death of a pregnant Ruthie (Shirley Mills), but I believe the film had the advantage of being given the added impact of a 1939 release (a time when the Great Depression and Dust Bowl Migration was still a fresh memory for many).  Also we see various themes portrayed in the film. The social stigma of sharecroppers and their plight, the tense rivalry of workers for jobs, even the ignorance of truck drivers at a diner pop up in the film to build on the story. In the end, this movie serves as a constant reminder of a period in history when so many people lost everything they had worked their whole lives for, only to find they could still hold onto their dreams...for this is the only thing that truly matters.pop up in the film to build on the story.

B000002UAU|5.0|Incredible that this album was released 40 years ago this week.  From a 38-year-old, I can say that I am envious of those of you that were able to enjoy the Beatles during their peak.  I was fortunate to be born to a huge Beatles fan, thus allowing me access to the best music ever made.  I have always loved Magical Mystery Tour, beginning when I was a young lad.  However, as the years have passed, I have grown a greater appreciation for Abbey Road and especially Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  I submit these as two of the finest albums ever made.<br /><br />The music here is tremendous and stands up today as being just as important and vital as it has ever been.  The title track(s) are outstanding, while my personal favorite is Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  From the album art and concept, to the fun and nostalgic mystery and clues regarding the death of Paul, to the wonderful songs... I think 40 years from now, people will still be talking about this album as being the best of all time.<br /><br />5 stars!!!!!!!
B000NVIGC0|2.0|Lots of people became excited upon hearing that Wilco's newest recording would be somewhat of a return to their more traditional roots-rock origins.  Count me among them, for although I eventually warmed to the \\"Summerteeth\\" to \\"Ghost is Born\\" sonic progression, I missed simple pleasures like \\"Passenger Side\\" from their debut album.<br /><br />That said, \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is a huge disappointment.  Whether Jeff Tweedy and company decide to dress their songs up with sonic flourishes is irrelevant if the songwriting isn't terribly compelling in the first place.  \\"Sky\\" is a tepid folk rock album which contains not a single memorable track.  It slides along pleasantly, and then fades from memory almost instantly.  Too bad.  The horribly mediocre American rock music scene sorely needs Wilco to be at the top of their game.
B00008PC2O|5.0|i love this film being a big film buff and all but also i've noticed that the price is fantastic and is even more cheaper in certain stores, anyway when i bought the dvd and popped it in the dvd player i was amazed with the picture pure high def 1080p i mean i baught this movie for 5.50 and it's in high definition, the blu-ray version is like 20 or 25 bucks so i'm wonderin why make a whole nother disc-format and just make standard dvd's in high def i mean perhaps u can't fit any special features but why not just make them double sided dvd's and put the special features on the other side instead of movie companies using 2 discs and waste money. i believe this will prevail and end the war against blu-ray vs. hd-dvd and just keep blank blu-ray discs for information purposes.  I mean i love blu-ray and i want one so bad but u gotta pay up the nose just to get one, at least players are becoming more and more affordable but i dont want to have to convert all my 700 dvds to high def formats. it's interesting how Artisan backed this movie and now it doesnt exist anymore as soon as the high def battle started, Lionsgate is now mastering all thier old movies and they back up blu-ray 100%, it just makes you think what coinsidences emerged with all this, terminator 2 on standard dvd is in high def (for us in the US anyway) it cost me 5.50 its just a big mystery to me...
B000002UDB|5.0|I still love this album as much as I have since I heard it as a pre-teen.  Though I have grown to appreciate Abbey Road and Sgt. Peppers as being greater albums, I can still spend many an hours listening to the fantastic songs on this album.  There is a great feel to this album.  It features lovely and uplifting songs from Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, to All You Need is Love.  For me, when it comes to great albums/CDs, all you need is the Beatles.

Except for that scene where the little girl kept messing with the tv antenna to get back at the person who made her believe she was responsible to all those car crashes by taking pictures with her camera, the movie did not have any other funny moment.  It's not for me.  Please wake me up when it's over.  Thanks.

B000000IWE|5.0|THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE FROM THE MOODIES. I LOVE THE MOFI VERSION.
B0000844I8|4.0|The 1990s saw four big science fiction movies.  The two biggest came near the end; Matrix and Phantom Menace.  But the two best came out in the mid 90's; Contact and Stargate.  And of all four, only Stargate spawned its own popular TV show.  The storyline is very innovative; the US military obtains an object that can be used to travel across the universe, a Stargate.  They hire a scientist, Daniel Jackson, to make it work.  Daniel succeeds, and is transported to a desert world (Arizona actually) along with a band of soldiers led by Kurt Russel's character, to search for extraterrestrial life.  They find life, in the form of enslaved humans serving a powerful alien who travels through space in the form of a gigantic pyramid.  Being good Americans, Daniel and the soldiers lead the humans in a rebellion, and the alien is killed by an atomic bomb.   <br /> <br />This DVD features a slightly longer version of the movie than the original theatrical release.  The extra scenes come mainly in the beginning, as we see how the alien first came to Earth.  The entire plot is very good and original, with almost nothing copied from any other sci-fi movie.  The link between the pyramids, ancient Egypt, and an alien race made in the movie was quite believable and original. The casting itself was great as all the characters fit their roles perfectly.   <br /> <br />The only drawbacks to the movie was some of the scenes were executed poorly.  The first of these occurs early in the movie when we see Professor Daniel Jackson giving a presentation and everyone walking out on him.  I have been to many scientific conferences and scientists never walk out en masse from a peer's presentation if they disagree with the presentation.  Instead, they embarass him in public with pointed questions.  The second really dumb scene occurs right after Daniel figures out the last symbol needed to operate the Stargate.  Immediately, the military sends in a probe, and the next day they send in a team of soldiers with Daniel as their guide.  Astronauts go through years of training before even having a chance to sit in the space shuttle, yet this guy gets to go to another planet after one night!  This was really fake and hokey.  Third, the soldiers sent on this mission are wholly umprepared.  They enter the stargate wearing fatigues and carrying AK-47's!  You would think they would be better prepared for traveling to another world.  How about some survival gear such as bulletproof vests, helmets equipped with oxygen masks, climbing gear, swimming gear, etc...   A fourth hokey scene comes when the soldiers encounter the enslaved humans on the other planet.  One soldier puts a handheld device by some minerals, and states that this mineral is of the same composition as the Stargate, quartz!  This is interesting considering earlier in the movie one character states that the Stargate is made of some unknown mineral.  Big contradiction!  The list goes on and on. <br /> <br />Overall, a good movie, very entertaining with a great storyline.  The only drawback is the numerous editing miscues and flaws.
B000002P2W|5.0|Nothing to say but Townshend at his most troubled and powerful. Perhaps it doesn't have the epic quality of Quadrophenia or the sonic marvels of Who's next, but the appeal here lies in the lyrics and the conviction in the vocals. Daltrey is at his most powerful on tracks like How many Friends where he is interpeting Petes lyrics magically. This is a must own. The weakest track is Squeeze Box but even that has an innocence that is refreshing. Great Great Stuff!!
B00005RFVL|5.0|If there is one thing that I can say about Robbie Williams, it is that he truly knows his way around a song.  I work in a bookstore that has a music department where we get to choose which CD's to play.  This is a staple in my playlist and every time that I play it, somebody buys it and I run out of stock. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the stellar ballad \\"I Will Talk And Ho llywood Will Listen\\".  The song was made as a comedic satire of the fame and glory associated with Hollywood, but this comedic does not take anything away from the musical brilliance.  The band is perfect and Robbie really shows off his chops. <br /> <br />The rest of the album are covers of musical greats such as Bobby Darin (\\"Mack The Knife\\", \\"Beyond The Sea\\"), Frank Sinatra (\\"It Was A Very Good Year\\", \\"Something Stupid\\") Nat King Cole (\\"Straighten Up And Fly Right\\") and Dean Martin (\\"Ain't That A Kick In The Head\\"), just to name a few.  The versions of these songs on the CD pay a definate homage to the originals, but Robbie adds a whole lot of `Oomph' with his spectacular voice and the accompaniment of flawless London Session Orchestra. <br /> <br />The artists that Robbie sings his duets with are perfectly chosen for each song, adding just the right amount of playfulness, sex appeal, comedy or raw talent where it is needed.  His solo tracks are simply irresistible.  His version of \\"One For My Baby\\" is perfection and \\"Have You Met Miss Jones?\\" will knock your socks off. <br /> <br />Robbie Williams truly is a musical chameleon, transforming from a promiscuous rocker to a deep, sensitive character to a sophisticated oldies crooner and back again.   <br /> <br />This CD truly is a treat to listen to.
0486274268|5.0|Ken Hultgren's animal drawing book is by far the best I've ever seen. The drawings are not only beautiful and full of life but rich in anatomical information as well. Studying and copying these drawings, combined with a few trips to the zoo and a horse ranch, enhanced my awareness of animal anatomy and movement enormously.  <br />I used this book as my primary resource for modeling, rigging, animating a horse in Maya. It's a great asset for animators, modelers, sculptors -- artists of any sort-- or anyone who loves animals and good drawings.
B000NA2776|4.0|\\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\" is the impressive, if somewhat campy debut album from the Lebanon-born Mika.  There have been a lot of comparisons to the great Freddy Mercury, and while their voices are similar, I would like to compare Mika to Robbie Williams.  There are times on the CD where I would put money on the fact that Robbie was singing.  Not only that, but the spirit of both artists are similar in that they both have fun with their CD's.  Mika doesn't take himself too seriously and it shows in the upbeat, amusing style of this CD. <br /> <br />What is great about this CD is that it has a great mixture between fun, catchy songs and ballad type songs.  The CD starts with two fun, catchy, campy tracks \\"Grace Kelly\\" and \\"Lollipop\\" that are sung in his marked falsetto.  Next is \\"My Interpretation\\" which is a slower ballad type song that shows off Mika's lower range.  \\"Love Today\\" is another of is fun songs, followed by \\"Relax, Take It Easy\\" which is mellow, yet still fun.  \\"Erase\\" is an awesome ballad that really showcases Mika's singing chops and \\"Happy Ending\\" is theatrical and wonderful. <br /> <br />While I think that the CD was generally good, I feel like Mika still needs some work lyrically and needs to back off the campy, silly songs just a little bit. <br /> <br />I would usually give a CD like this three out of five stars, but it is just so catchy and enjoyable that I will bump it up to four stars.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Completely hooked after first episode. JRM, Henry Cavill, and Maria Kennedy give stellar performances. Absolutely love this show but there are a few inaccuracies, such as combining King Henry's sisters into one, Margaret, whom did not marry Brandon, but sister Mary did and bore his chldren.Henry Fitzroy dying at such a young age when he had a great deal to do with Anne Boleyn's trial was mind blowing. Do not watch this if you believe you are \\"learning\\" about the Tudors, it clearly deviates from the truth, but it is an amazing piece of fiction with a gorgeous cast!!!
0006547745|5.0|I could not put this book down once i had started it. I was absolutely fascinated by Dalrymple's descriptions of modern day early Christian sites. The alternative veiwpoint he offers about the archeological situation of these sites in the Middle East and the way of living of the local Christian population absorbed me from the very beginning. I found the story so interesting that I visited Lebanon early this year. It was exactly as I expected and I look forward to returning. Hopefully I shall return to the region soon. I have been interested in early Christian sites in Egypt and the Coptic Church there but this book has opened up a whole new vista for me. I would encourage those who can, to visit the area and support tourism. I was the only foreign visitor to Baalbek (Lebanon)on the day I visitedand it was the same at other world famous sites in Lebanon, and that is a very sad situation. The people are friendly, courteous and open-hearted,the food delicious, the tourist sites awe-inspiring, and the driving?well, best you take a taxi and close your eyes! William Dalrymple's book sparked a love-affair in me with these places and those who live there.
1582701709|5.0|Product arrived to our home quickly, great book and well worth reading, book was in great shape.  Thank you.
B00005JPD0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie - it starts off with a bang, literally, and the suspense just keeps building.  An amazing and thrilling movie that has action, time travel, and fantasy all rolled up in one and Denzel Washington doing what he does best.
B000001FMC|5.0|I was glad to be able to replace this CD! - Thanks!
0385340559|4.0|In these days of \\"metrosexuals\\" and men getting facials at a spa, it is refreshing to count on Lee Child's annual installment of the ex-Army mayhem-man  Jack Reacher, who'd have his fingernails pulled out with pliers before being manicured.  And back he is, folding toothbrush in his pocket, ready as always to rid the world of another annoyance.<br /><br />But this time around, the stoic loner Reacher has some company.  Frances Neagley, essentially the female version of Reacher and former member of his US Army Special Investigations team, contacts our nomadic hero through an arcane bank transaction, the first in a string of mental deductions that would leave Holmes and Watson with jaws agape.  Neagley tells of the brutal death of Calvin Frantz, another former member of their elite unit, sending Reacher, Neagley and their remaining colleagues to a southern California rendezvous solving the mystery and avenging the murder.  The plot thickens and as other members of the team go missing, and Reacher and company find themselves embroiled in super-secret government operations and international terrorism.<br /><br />As far as escapist thriller fiction, \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" is about as good as it gets.  If you don't overanalyze or rationalize, you can kick back and savor Reacher's unique brand of Zen violence told in Child's no-nonsense, rapid-fire prose.  But measured against Child's high standards, I found this one sub-par.  Reacher's savant-like mathematical talents, while necessary to set the plot in motion, were strained at first and a burden before long.  And I found myself liking Reacher less as a team leader as I have as the lone wolf maverick, and the group dynamics felt forced and frayed.  But I quibble.  \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" is a must-read, another hard-core action page-turner that will add \\"don't mess with special investigations\\" as another line in that thing about \\"spitting into the wind.\\"
B000NVIXDW|4.0|...the more I listen to it, the less I regret pre-ordering it.  I suppose one of the reasons for my initial dislike of the compilation was that there was an inconsistent, or rather less obvious, sound compared to [[ASIN:B000088E6D Michael Bublé]] or [[ASIN:B00070Q7VO It's Time]]  However, that's also a reason why it's growing on me.  Similar to my music tastes and library, there seems to be a nicely balanced mix of sounds, cheesy lyrics, original lyrics, covers, and harmonies.  He starts upbeat and strong and gradually winds both tempo and energy down to the end.  (If the tracks were better ordered so that the energy level was invariable throughout, I would have given this 5 stars).  However, I can only wait in anticipation for his future works as with each new CD there are more songs with featured artists, more original music, and a better idea of what the real talent of Michael Buble is.      Below is a list of the songs followed by either reasons I like(*) them or a brief description:    *1. The Best Is Yet To Come - great classic jazz opener, big band style  *2. It Had Better Be Tonight - a fun mix that reminds me of a cross between Copacabana and the James Bond theme  *3. Me & Mrs. Jones - smooth and sexy vocals (i.e. Brad Pitt)  *4. I'm Your Man - smooth and silky, classy music (i.e. Pierce Brosnan)  *5. Comin' Home Baby - great catchy beat and fantastic harmonies with Boyz II Men (who bring a touch of acapella) that surpass my slight disappointment in the simple lyrics (note: I haven't read all songs' lyrics)  *6. Lost - fantastic original ballade by Buble and the talented Alan Chang that tells a moving tale (I can see this on a tv drama soundtrack; similar to \\"Chasing Cars\\" of Snow Patrol's [[ASIN:B000F3UADO Eyes Open]], I put this track on repeat for at least 10x...and counting)  7. Call Me Irresponsible - simply Sinatra  8. Wonderful Tonight - although I currently prefer the touching original by Eric Clapton, Buble's version isn't bad...just different  *9. Everything - cute, infectious original with \\"bubble gum\\" lyrics by Buble and Alan Chang; brings guitars back into the foreground; now played by radio stations  10.I've Got the World on a String - snazzy Sinatra style  11.Always on My Mind - the only other version I can remember is that by Elvis Presley; Buble tones down his vocals a bit here, slightly dull  12.That's Life - Buble peps it back up with the addition of a choir, soothing  13.Dream - soothing ballade with gentle string accompaniments
B000000WJK|4.0|I've been a Richard Ashcroft fan since I first heard \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" but never ventured backward into the less known (in the United States) first two albums by The Verve. Since I picked up ''This Is Music: The Singles 92-98'' I've wanted to go back and listen to this album and ''A Northern Soul''. After hearing this album I could not stop listening or replaying it. The other reviewers say that this album is one of the most played in their collection and I can see why.<br /><br />True to the excesses of The Verve at the time, the album has a very mellow and relaxing feel to it. It will calm you and let your mind think, but not in a negative manner. The songs are soft which allows the lyrics and melody to flow together. Some listeners won't be able to get past what seems to be similar sounds from each song or what they perceive as no real separations between songs, but those thoughts are misguided.<br /><br />If you like \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" because it was popular, stay away from this album. But if you would like to explore more of The Verve beyond that song and ''Urban Hymns'', check out this fantastic beginning for a band that never received the credits they deserved.
B000OCY7JE|4.0|This subtitled movie (though the scenes in India are in English), is a very enjoyable look at the radically different lives that one man leads in India, and the Denmark he left behind.  Mads Mikkelsen plays Jacob (with a 'c', it is noted) who helps run an orphanage in a desperately poor India.  An offer comes in from a rich Dane, Jørgen, who is thinking of supporting the charity.  Jacob promises to return in time to one of his charge's, Pramod, birthday. He reluctantly leaves his life in India helping the children, puts on a suit, boards a well-appointed plane and gets a chauffeured ride to a luxury hotel.  It's as much of a culture shock as one can imagine.<br /><br />The rich Jørgen's life is one filled with board meetings, a mansion, wealthy friends and relatives, every one of whom could make a difference in the poverty of India.  However, there is a wedding to plan, with Jørgen's daughter getting married to a young man of the firm.<br /><br />Several plot twists ensue that make Jacob question the purpose of his life, and which world he wants and needs to live in.  It turns out his love and compassion is needed in both.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000NA28I4|4.0|Okay, so I've read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. When did any movie ever duplicate the book? It isn't meant to; it is meant to bring to the screen the basic story. You can't watch a dragon grow up in an hour and a half, so you have to be creative about getting a baby dragon into adulthood quickly. There is never enough time to fit everything that is in the book into a movie, so you get the highlights to tell the story on the screen. I felt this movie was quite fun and enjoyable to watch. Ed Speleers is off to a great start as a fresh young actor (who, by the way, won this role by beating 180,000 competitors).  I was quite impressed by his performance, considering the fact that this is his first movie. I was equally empressed by Saphira. I don't see how anyone can complain about the special effects in this film.  That dragon looked real, from babyhood to adulthood! I don't for a moment feel that this movie was trying to imitate Lord of the Rings or any other movie, for that matter.  I am a GREAT Lord of the Rings fan, and tend to be critical of imitations. Are we going to compare every fantasy film that comes along with LOTR? I applaud the efforts of the director, cast and crew for this fun fantasy.  The music was great, the CGI fantastic, and all in all, I was entertained, and that is what I watch a movie for.
0761119752|5.0|This book is fabulous for bedtime.  My active toddler has a hard time winding down for bed, but when we read her this book she has an easier time at bedtime.  The illustrations are hilarious and the rhymes are great.  I even enjoy reading my children this book.  Its really fun if you enjoy \\"getting into\\" the rhythm of the language.  Sandra Boynton books are the BEST.
B000002INR|5.0|WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS GROUP OTHER THAN TOTALLY DYNAMITE. THERE DEBUT ALBUM WAS OFF THE CHART! GREAT SOUND AND GREAT SONGS. THE HITS INCLUDE \\"YOUTH GONE WILD\\",\\"18 AND LIFE\\",AND THE BALLAD \\"I REMEMBER YOU\\".BUT ALL THE SONGS ARE PRETTY GOOD. CHECK THIS ONE OUT IT'S WE'LL WORTH A LISTEN.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|This album isn't NEARLY as bad as the impression the single, \\"Girlfriend\\" gives off.  While somewhat catchy, that song is absolutely abominable.  It's a direct rip-off of the song, \\"Mickey\\", and about as annoying and juvenille as a song can get.  Why that was chosen as the first single is beyond me.<br /><br />With that said, the album is actually not too bad.  I assure you, the rest of the album isn't as cheesy as the impression, \\"Girlfriend\\" gives off.  Yes, there are several clunkers on this album.  A few songs, such as \\"Everything Back But You\\" and \\"I Don't Have To Try\\" are absolutely horrific.<br /><br />Standout songs, \\"I Can Do Better\\" and \\"Runaway\\" will do very well on radio.  They're very catchy and upbeat.  And \\"When You're Gone\\" has just been released as a single.<br /><br />All in all, not a good album, but not miserable either.  Certainly not worthy of 1 and 2 star reviews.  It makes me think if anyone actually listened to the album, or just based their review on hearing \\"Girlfriend\\".  Like I said before, it's NOT as cheesy as it seems.
0142004413|4.0|The book My Family and other Animals is most definitely a different book. It is about a young boy, the author, who moves to a small island with his large and diverse family. Gerald is very interested in animals and such. So when they move to the island he likes to just wander around and look at the species and try to capture them. There are really two types of writing going on in the novel, a story part and an informational part. It is very interesting during the more story part, for me, since something is actually happening. However, I do no necessarily like the informational part since it is about animals. I do like animals, but I think it is a bore to read about them like it was a text book. Overall, this is a really good book and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it makes you laugh when the whole family gets together with all their differences. I recommend it highly to all the animal lovers out there
1582701709|3.0|I must admit, \\"The Secret\\" opened my eyes very wide, to the Law of Attraction.  I had heard about it before, but I never knew exactly how it worked.  \\"The Secret\\" opened up a whole new world to me, and I am grateful for it coming into existence.  However, with that said, while it's motivational and inspirational, it's SEVERELY lacking in concrete material.  It's enough to wet your appetite, but for more information, you definitely need to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I read \\"The Secret\\" book and watched the DVD many times, and I was still not attracting ANYTHING into my life.  5 months went by, still nothing.  I started looking elsewhere for answers.  I listened to Bob Proctor's \\"Science of Getting Rich\\" CDs, and Jack Canfield's \\"Success Principles\\" book, and within a WEEK, amazing opportunities starting coming into my life.  Like I said, \\"The Secret\\" opened up my eyes to how things really work, but they didn't bring a single thing into my life.  However, when I went deeper, then things started to manifest.<br /><br />This book, and even the DVD are very good for beginners, but to become a master of the secret, you need to get a book with more information and not so much \\"Pie in the Sky\\" as the Secret contains.  It's a bit too \\"rah rah\\" and lacking in \\"how to\\".<br /><br />\\"The Secret\\" mentions very little to nothing about hard work, dedication, persistance, dealing with adversity, and all of the thing one must go through in order to be successful.  The Law of Attraction is a wonderful thing, but so is reality.  I certainly don't want to burst anyone's bubble, but once you come across a Million Dollar Idea, you need to bust your butt and work hard, in order to bring about success.  The Secret makes you believe you can be lazy, and become rich beyond your wildest dreams.  Can that happen?  Yes.  People win the lottery all of the time.  Is it going to happen to you?  Highly unlikely.<br /><br />I just wish \\"The Secret\\" was a little bit more realistic, and rich in \\"how to\\" rather than cheerleading..
B000M4RG42|4.0|Clint Eastwood has marvelously portrayed a double-edged sword. Through flashbacks, he demonstrates the individual character and valor of real historical figures from the battle of Iwo Jima--boys one and all.<br /><br />The three U.S. Marine battle survivors were saved from further bloodshed--albeit not their post traumatic stress, aka battle fatigue, or their guilt--by U.S. desperation for funds to cover the bullets, tanks and ships necessary to achieve victory in the Pacific theater.<br /><br />Eastwood demonstrates that men can be heroes and villains at once. The \\"heroes\\" publicized by the renowned Iwo Jima photograph were really accidental stand-ins, albeit stand-ins who also risked their lives, replacing the first hoisted flag (on an officers' whim, to preserve the original for the soldiers who spilled their blood for it).<br /><br />Yet these three men, (including a Pima tribesman, Ira Hayes, despised by many of the public and military men who welcome the heroes home) did more than most for the war effort--by helping to raise funds to save their fellow troops, although doing it meant betraying their honesty and the memories of the real flag-raisers. It was a question of savings lives.<br /><br />But in plugging U.S. war bonds, the men were completely honest in one thing: investing was a way for Americans to honor the dead. That honor, and the self-effacement of the Iwo Jima bond campaigners, helped win the war.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I think this is a great disc. But I liked Ghost better than Yankee and I am a huge Jazz and Nels Cline fan who after watching I Am Trying To Break Your Heart thought Wilco is better off without Jay Bennet anyways, so what do I know.  <br /> <br />A lot of nice songs on this with great performances by everybody in the band. Fans of early 70's rock and John Lennon should love this.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Wilco's newest album is fantastic.  The in-your-face jackhammering and clunky industrial clatter of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born have been replaced by subtle nuance and a sublime set of strikingly complex compositions.  On songs like \\"Impossible Germany,\\" the band deftly blends three guitars into a well-constructed and soaring instrumental finish.  Furthermore, as a collective, I think they sound better than ever.  Jeff continues to write wonderful songs and guitar virtuoso Nels Cline adds so much life and flourish to Wilco's sound.  On the whole, most of the reviews that I have read have been negative and characterize the album as a disappointing return to the not-so-avant-garde Wilco of old.  Many of the reviewers also claim that the album is too bland and conventional and as a result fails to push the creative envelope.  I completely disagree.  In order to make a great album that the conformist army at Pitchfork will love, do you have to intentionally make the contents difficult to digest?  Do you have to overwhelm the listener with dissonance and atonal cacophany?  For me, none of the above is necessary and frequently when bands set out with the explicit goal of innovating or creating an avant-garde masterpiece, they fall flat on their faces, creating instead something trite and hackneyed.  Sky Blue Sky is beautiful in both obvious and understated ways.  It is an album of beautifully-constructed, masterfully-executed songs overflowing with subtlety, emotive energy, and grace.  As with all of Wilco's work, I highly recommend this album!    Walter B.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|I just finished watching The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2) on Blu-ray which I ordered from Amazon.  It's one of my favorite films and still holds up today, largely thanks to its wonderful direction and quality attention to realistic detail.  Likened to westerns and samurai films, it should be at the top of anyones list that is a fan of action, cars, post apocalyptic futures and stories about a lone wolf type hero.  The quality of the picture is great and the sound is good too thanks to being on Blu-ray.  And if you are worried about getting this because you haven't seen the first Mad Max, fear not, the film is done in such a way you don't really need to.  There is a short recap at the start of the film which will help tie things together.  Also a new feature exclusive to the high-def version not found on regular DVD is a new audio commentary with the director.  I haven't listened to it yet so I'm hoping it sheds insight onto the production of this wonderful film.<br />See Mel Gibson at his best as... The Road Warrior.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Surely the panjandrums behind one of the television networks out there can look at this product's rating on Amazon and get the message!  Over 3,000 ratings and Firefly has a solid and immobile FIVE stars...  This show deserves another chance, if only because I would like to see more (along with thousands of others).  I have seen every episode of the show and the movie (Serenity) and I feel confident that my five-star rating is inadequate - but at least you know where I stand.  This show combined excellent acting, enthralling stories, and some of the best character development I have seen these many years.  Science fiction buffs and the average TV watcher alike will find something incredible in Firefly - I hope that everyone out there takes this chance to \\"find Serenity.\\"
B0000AUHQT|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie for an excellent book. You won't be disappointed by differences in events or entire scences cut out in this movie version of a book.  The only differences were how I imagined characters; the book describes the character of Tom to be a very tough strong man, but in the movie he is not. The rest of the cast is perfect for the roles.  This movie is an exceptional portrayal of F. Scott Fitzgerald's book.    <br />For those who have not read the book (although I strongly recommend it) this story is a great account of the 1920s.  It shows the excitement and the fun of that time in American history, as well as a little added drama.  From the dress to the extravagant life styles of the wealthy as well as the lower class, it shows us a wide-ranging view of the 1920s.  This is an appealing movie from beginning to end, full of events and surprises.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I bought this DVD for my classroom to provide examples of statistics for students to confirm or dispute through research. <br /> <br />
B000O179A4|5.0|I received my item at the time promised in good condition, I am very happy with it.
B000O178BY|5.0|Another great album by TR and I couldnt expect more. I bought this CD over a week ago and i cant stop playing it. Although i was taken back at the style of music, its still great stuff. Trent never seems to put the same kind of stuff out twice. So maybe year zero was a little unexpected but it is darn good. Everyone said the same thing about With teeth, and that was a great album as well. I love every song on this album except for My violent heart- it just doesnt do anything for me. This album is also interesting since its a concept album using ARG- go to the nin wiki site, there is vast amount of info on all the stuff thats been solved  (of course its not the first concept album put out by NIN).  <br /> <br />Even if your not a NIN fan- GET THIS ALBUM!! Trent is a musical genius. <br /> <br />I cannot wait for NIN to tour US- and although it doesnt look like he will be doing one for YZ, im sure he will after he puts out YZ part 2 next decemeber i believe?? AGh can i wait that long....?!
0765348276|4.0|I don't have much reading time these days, thanks to two careers and two young kids.  The fact that I neglected the work side of things in order to finish this book in two days is a tribute to Scalzi's writing ability.<br /><br />Old Man's War tells the story of John Perry, a 75-year-old man who enlists in the Colonial Defense Force (CDF). In Scalzi's universe, there's a lot of prime real estate out there for colonization. Unfortunately, there are a lot of alien races fighting to claim it. So the CDF recruits old, experienced men and women, providing them the physical enhancements they need in order to fight for humanity's future among the stars.<br /><br />A number of folks point to Robert Heinlein as an influence on Old Man's War, and John Perry certainly feels like a Heinlein hero. Older and experienced, very down to earth (no pun intended), surprisingly competent, with little tolerance for stupidity. Perry is a good, likable man, one who still loves his dead wife, and who tries to do the right thing for himself and others.<br /><br />While the book describes a number of battles, leading up to one climactic fight for a piece of alien technology, the fighting really isn't the core of the story. There's plenty of fun and flash and nifty SF to thrill the kid in me, but at its heart, Old Man's War is a character-driven story. It's about John Perry learning to adapt to his new life as a soldier, and eventually starting to think about life beyond his term in the CDF.<br /><br />I have to admit, the book strained my suspension of disbelief at times. There are too many instances where John Perry is the best or the smartest or the luckiest soldier in the field. But even as I was muttering, \\"Yeah, right,\\" under my breath, I kept reading, because the book is simply too much fun to put down.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, The Ghost Brigades.
0312360266|5.0|After finishing less-than-spectacular novel Tantalize, I was hesitant to read MARKED--fearing it would be unoriginal, boring, and perhaps even unbelievable. For a girl that indulges in vampire/werewolf romance, believability is the best aspect an author can bring to the table. <br /> <br />Obviously, the subject is not real, but the whole point of fiction is to be caught up in the world an author creates: to wish you were in that world, in the character's shoes.  <br /> <br />The Cast ladies did that divinely. The plot of a young girl, marked as a vampire in an accepting but prejudice society, was fresh and new with aspects of other supernatural attributes (none of which were hokey).   <br /> <br />Pros: <br />++ Detailed enough to be descriptive, but not headache-inducing (too many details leads me to believe an author is trying to convince me to keep reading) <br />++ Vampire aspect definitely present, but a better, more sophisticated version (not the 594890 redundant versions that become washed-out and boring) <br />++ Likable protagonists (good guys) <br />++ GREAT romance. Sexy, knee-quivering romance You'll be rooting for these two! <br />++ Modern teenage \\"real-life\\" issues. There's a gay guy, a female witch with a capital B, conservative parents, normal (natural!) teenage language, sex-related topics, etc. All of which aren't forced or overdone. It's nice, refreshing, and adds to the believability of the novel. <br />++ Page-turning, edge-of-your-bed (or wherever you read) plot <br />++ Subsequent novels arrive in October 2007, and late 2007-early 2008 (I hate having to wait 1+ year(s) to continue reading) <br /> <br />Cons: (only a few) <br />-- repetitive words/phrases (more so present at the beginning. you either get over it or get used to it) <br />-- a bit slow to begin, but picks up quickly. More of the action occurs towards the end of the book <br /> <br /> <br />WARNING: <br />While this book is YA, there are some racy elements that aren't for the faint of heart or naive. I particularly like that it isn't subdued or reserve, but if you're more sensitive to that kind of thing, be cautious. It still qualifies as YA, though. <br /> <br />Happy reading =)
0316166685|2.0|I picked up this book because of all the hype and good things I had heard about it.  I was drawn in very quickly due to the author's excellent prose (no arguing, Sebold is a beautiful and brilliant writer), but lost interest very quickly.  There's really no plot, no central STORY.  Things are just kinda happening and while she describes it poignantly (though at times it was very cheesy and corny), it's just not engaging. <br /> <br />Far from un-put-down-able, but it is read-able.  It's just dull and lackluster.  Good premise, promising author, but skip this book.  You're not missing much.  Check out Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes or My Sister's Keeper instead.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I am so packed with school and work, that I do not have time to come rate movies and soundtracks online, BUT... This soundtrack is worth taking some time out of my day. In my honest opinion this sound sets Zimmer at a new mark of not only being the best composer but the best at making music come to life. I listen to this CD at work, in my car, on my IPOD, I even put it as background music when I'm playing computer games. I honestly recommend this soundtrack to everyone, even if your new to soundtracks, this is a great milestone.      - Hoist the Colours (4.5 of 5)   Seems longer in the movie, but I still enjoy listening to it...    - Singapore (5 of 5)   Nice oriental mix, fast paced, great intro for Jack's Theme Song    - At Wit's End (5 of 5)   Very nicely composed song, good intro for Davy Jones     - Multiple Jacks (4 of 5)   Listening to this track can make you delusional like Jack... But I still like it...    - Up is Down (6 of 5)   My favorite track on this CD, it is filled with fun and excitement... #1 Track on CD!!!    - I See Dead People in Boats (4 of 5)   Scary and haunting, watch the movie and you'll understand. The middle is freaky, but it gets better.      - The Brethren Court (4 of 5)  Interesting song.... confusing but interesting    -  Parlay (5 of 5)   Nice themed song has a lot of meaning to it. Even without watching the movie you could feel what is supposed to be going on in the movie. I like this track    -  Calypso (3.5 of 5)  Nice introduction, scary middle, slow ending... Still good though, fits in perfectly with the movie..     -  What Shall We Die For (5 of 5)   Very strong song, well composed, great song to lift your mood. I wish I was longer    -  I Don't Think Now is The Best Time (6 of 5)  Very good song, this song is king of like a rundown of other tracks, very nicely composed, around the 8 minute mark the song reaches its \\"greatness point\\". It also has an extended version of the love theme in it.    - One Day (6 of 5)   Superb song,has a very nice lengthy romantic part to it, great relaxation music.     - Drink up me Hearties (6 of 5)   The final credits theme song. This song summaries the whole 55 min of music into 4:31. It brings back memories from The Curse of the Black Pearl. The Original Theme!!!    They need to make an extended version of this soundtrack, like they did for Gladiator, I would be the first one to buy it. Zimmer truly makes his music come to life.  This is the soundtrack that will have you humming all day... TRUST ME
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Although I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, I'll leave the discussion of its acting and writing merits to others (except to note that Britain should probably patent Hugh Grant's schtick).<br /><br />What struck me on a recent second viewing was the way it manages to make London (which like New York waxes and wanes both in appeal and in public perception) look like an absolutely magical place to live.<br /><br />It made me want to go back and look at all those charming little mews flats I can't afford.
B000QUCNOK|1.0|My friend went to see this movie in the cinema, and I heard this movie wasn't worth watching. Should I purchase Perfume or not, because I enjoy victorian drama. Andrew Ayton, from United Kingdom. <br />
0515141429|4.0|Lee Child was an author I was waiting to read. When I read the collection of short stories by James Patterson called, \\"Thriller,\\" Lee Child was an author I wanted to read. His short story, \\"James Penney's New Identity,\\" merely gave a snap shot of Jack Reacher. \\"Killing Floor\\" gives you a nice introduction. Lee Child decides to let Reacher tell his own story.<br /><br />You will meet Jack at breakfast, and you will encounter the most unpleasant interruption that he gets from a couple of cops, one named Baker. Immediately he is hauled into the Margrave police station, located in beautiful Margrave, Georgia. He's been arrested for murder, but he didn't murder anybody. Reacher finds out that he has a few friends, as well as a few enemies in this neck of the woods. Jack Reacher is a drifter. He likes the ladies, and one Officer Roscoe likes him as well. An ex-military policeman, Reacher isn't one to be messed around with. So don't mess with him! Or will people really be that stupid?<br /><br />This is a good read, with an even better mystery revolving around it. The money is good, but the story is better. It might even have the obvious ending. You might be surprised, who knows. This is a story that shows a lot of promise, and it delivers. It even includes a little bit of sleaze every now and then.<br /><br />Well, I've had my introduction. Maybe some other time I'll sit down and get to know Jack Reacher a little bit better. Good work, Lee Child!
B000HT386M|4.0|Whish I had had one of those things a long time ago.  Not Sandler's best, but is decent family movie
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watch it on my ps3 on a Samsung 1080 Plasma, Really the most incredible images.
B000P0J02E|5.0|After seeing At World's End I was desperate to purchase the soundtrack. I think that this is the best soundtrack of the three. It incorporates themes from all of them, except on a much larger, more epic scale. It also adds new styles, such as in \\"The Bretheren Court\\" and \\"Singapore.\\" The global nature of the film allowed for music from different cultures to be incorporated, which I very much enjoy. Hans Zimmer and crew have done an amazing job and I am not disappointed in the least. I was also quite pleased to see on the insert that Gore Verbinsky played the guitar for the recording. The CD case is paper, making it somewhat flimsy, but I am not too bothered by it. The insert contains many photos from the movie, including production photos, which I found quite interesting and enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of film scores or who just enjoys captivating, epic music. It is one of Zimmer's best works yet!
B000P0J02E|5.0|This is by far the best soundtrack of 2007 thus far.  In my opinion this is some of Zimmer's best work since Gladiator.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Say you're strolling through the mall, you stop by your favourite music-store and you see a big poster reading \\"The Blackening - New MachineHead album\\" with that scary 13th century Death painting in the cover. You wonder \\"When was the last time I got a worthy metal CD?\\".  <br /> <br />Let's put you aren't a huge metal fan. I mean you're a 20 to 30 y.o.... you've been through Metallica, perhaps Pantera and even Megadeth, and you still remember with passion and joy those amazing riffs and powerful lyrics. \\"Should I give it a try?\\"  <br /> <br />In most of the cases in today's modern metal, the answer would be no. However, the Blackening is just something else. The band stands well above all the rest in the present modern metal scene. And after listening to all their discography, included this album, at least a dozen times, I don't know exactly why they keep being so musically attractive to my ears.  <br /> <br />It could be their performance, but they don't execute as good as Dream Theater. It could be their lyrics, but you can't compare them to Nordic Metal bands. Perhaps it's their creativity, but what the heck!, let's face it, it's all been done and redone in modern music. Is it their attitude? Their \\"this is my music, f@ck all else\\" stance?  <br />    <br />I cannot precise any single feature/ability that makes this album worth every buck. All I know is when I heard it for the first time, it felt like those great masterpieces of old. I feel lucky to be able to assist to this time right here and know. Probably, a few years from now, my children will say something like \\"Yeah, my dad was a metal-head all the way back since the time of The Blackening.\\"
1563890119|5.0|This is not the best title in the sandman series (I am a fan of three and four) but when compared to other comics and TPB's it really stands out.  The last chapter is must read for the series, introducing the character of death..buy this book!
B000002KMY|5.0|Certainly a staple in any metal/hard rock fan's catalog; A near perfect album on every front, from the powerful, legendary vocal style of Dio, the intricate basswork of Butler, the tasteful yet busy drumming of Appice, and some of the best guitarwork Iommi has done to date. 'Voodoo' has always been my personal favorite here, but every track is highly listenable, inspiring, and what Black Sabbath are all about. Who other than Dio can get away with singing \\"Bring me your children, they'll burn...\\" or \\"You were a fool, but that's cool, it's alright...\\" with such menace and emotion, as opposed to making those lyrics sound totally laughable? Classic stuff.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This DVD is the most incredible musical concert I've ever seen.  The quality is absolutely stunning, both visual and sound.  The performance captured on this DVD is breathtaking, every single song is excellent and there is no fluff in this one. You'll play it a thousand times and never get tired of watching it.  Celtic Woman is the best musical sensation ever to come about, the ladies are geniune and will speak to your heart in song.  The musical director, David Downes is an absolute musical genius.
B000001Y9I|4.0|Replace Blackmore? Yes, they did...and it worked out well this time. Steve Morse has always been a favorite of mine, and his soaring technical abilities allow the musicians alot more freedom without limitations. Whether it's Morse's superior technical ability or overall nicer attitude as a person that allows this freedom, I dunno. But the band sounds reborn; The tracks are lively, skilled, and varied. Morse channels the essence of Blackmore in many of is leads, yet he is def. his own man; The production is excellent, and there is alot of melody on this album; This is an album by a band having fun again. I was very happily surprised, and recommend it as the best Morse/Purple collaboration.
B000051Y0G|5.0|this is her best album in my opinion.
B00000JBFW|4.0|I remember waiting for this album like waiting for Xmas; And while only a handful of tracks could be considered 'classic Deep Purple', every song is solid, and all the players are in fine form. Blackmore is his usual unusual self, complete with angular, odd-scales, blues flurries, and his trademark, stinging vibrato; Ian sounds right at home, and the band just seems to follow close behind. This has been recently remastered(I don't know about the paticular version I'm reviewing, but I know it's out there...), so it sounds even better. And for being close to 25 years old, it still sounds great to me. A good CD to introduce younger listeners to these guys...it's old, but not that old.
0743298020|5.0|I typically shy away from \\"best sellers.\\"  I am glad I fell into the flock with this one.  Setterfield's writing skills are lovely.  I enjoyed her style and tone - well written!   <br /> <br />The story itself is an interesting gothic tale of an eccentric family with plenty of secrets. At times, I felt that Setterfield tried to incorporate too many dysfunctional family elements - it was a bit too much icing - -but I suppose, actually, familes such as these slip on the slope of crazy behavior.  The characters were rich and entertaining - quite mysterious.   I was not completely satisfied with the explination of Vida's history - the twist in her story was a little flimsy - -or at least I felt a bit of carnival-style bait and switch deception was going on. But all in all - an entertaining story with an interesting tapestry of characters and plot lines. Don't miss it.
B000005RFQ|4.0|First, if you don't like Ian Gillan, you won't like this CD. Probably. But I like him, as while the production on this album is at the very least 'odd', I find myself playing this more than most other Sabbath CD's. 'Zero The Hero' is one of the best Sabbath riffs ever, and there is a certain 'fabulous disaster' stigma attached to this album; I know there was supposedly some turmoil within the band while recording this, and Gillan sounds half asleep on 'Born Again' at times; Still, no denying that Sabbath sound is in tact; And while this CD is considered an oddity at most to die hard fans, it just may be the last great Sabbath album.  Oh, and Gillan sounds plenty demonic here at times. I knew he had it in him. I remember seeing them live on this tour, and just being blown away by his performance. Too bad he didn't get to stay a little longer....
0307237699|4.0|A good friend gave me this book as a Christmas present.  While I was not sure if I would enjoy reading the book, I found it a terrific read.<br /><br />The Audacity of Hope is neither an autobiography or a political manifesto -- while Obama meanders somewhere in the middle, the most accurate description of the book would be a presentation of Barack Obama as a presidential candidate.  In his book, Obama discusses issues such as race, religion and politics, foreign and economic policy, and some of the individuals he has met and lessons he has learned on his political rise up through the United States Senate.<br /><br />Many strengths of The Audacity of Hope coincide with Obama's strengths as a candidate.  He is a cogent, articulate communicator, and as such, his book transitions easily from his personal anecdotes to U.S. domestic policy.  While his explanations are direct and simple, they sufficiently articulate his policies.  Yet perhaps the most refreshing aspect of Obama's rhetoric is that is remains largely free from ad hominem attacks on his political adversaries.  He does not spew hatred of his political opponents -- it is as if he is too interested in the policies themselves to fall into the trap of besmirching the character of those who disagree with him.  It is this quality of Obama's character which has made him one of the most venerated presidential candidates today.<br /><br />The weaknesses of this book prove to be more elusive.  Obama is a savvy political candidate -- his book contains very few specific statements of what his policies would entail, nor are we allowed to see the entire spectrum of his political views.  The same is true of his personal life.  This is not a \\"tell-all\\" book.  Obama is not interested in bringing any skeletons out of the closet, as some autobiographies do.  I should note that as someone with more conservative/libertarian opinions, there are many of Obama's specific policy statements that I disagree with -- his arguments, however, are well-constructed and certainly sincere.<br /><br />Of course, the objectives behind The Audacity of Hope are not literary, but ultimately political.  Obama, a charismatic candidate and apt articulator, shrewdly realizes this medium plays to his strengths.  The Audacity of Hope aims to fill the void of Obama's relatively \\"unknown\\" status with his best qualities.  To that end, the book is a masterpiece.d and certainly sincere.

0224064924|3.0|If you don't bother to think about this story, then it is a whimsical little tale (only 55 pages) about a couple of elderly people who have unusual character traits and who end up getting married and living happily ever after. How sweet, just the thing to entertain young malleable minds. <br /> <br />But what is really going on here? <br /> <br />Let's start with Mr. Hoppy, who is retired and who has always been a lonely man and is very shy. Presumably he has never been married. He loves gazing down on Mrs. Silver when she is out on her balcony, which conveniently juts out a good bit further than Mr. Hoppy's balcony. <br /> <br />As for the widow Mrs. Silver, she tells Mr. Hoppy, \\"I'll be your slave for life\\" if he can tell her how to make her beloved pet tortoise Alfie grow faster. \\"Size, of course, was everything,\\" as it says a few pages later. <br /> <br />\\"Back in his flat, Mr. Hoppy was simply quivering all over in excitement. 'Your slave for life', he kept repeating to himself. What bliss!\\" <br /> <br />Hmm, time to call in Freud? <br /> <br />So Mr. Hoppy devises a deceitful plan whereby he convinces Mrs. Silver that she should recite a silly incantation to Alfie three times a day. Mrs. Silver is gullible enough to believe this. <br /> <br />Mr. Hoppy then snatches Mrs. Silver's beloved Alfie from the balcony below, and lowers a slightly larger tortoise to replace him. He repeats this operation eight times over the next two months. Mrs. Silver is sure that Alfie has grown due to Mr. Hoppy's incantation that she is still reciting to \\"Alfie\\" three times a day. <br /> <br />\\"You're a miracle-man, you are indeed!\\" says Mrs. Silver. <br /> <br />\\"Mrs. Silver, please will you marry me?\\" blurts out Mr. Hoppy. <br /> <br />As for the illustrations, Mrs. Silver is shown to be a plump and well-endowed woman who favors low-cut dresses. Several drawings show the splendid view that Mr. Hoppy has from his vantage point on the balcony above. No wonder he loves leaning overhis balcony-rail and gazing down on Mrs. Silver. <br /> <br />The moral of the story? All's well that ends well. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen

B00005JPAO|4.0|Helen mirren gives a great performance as many have already stated.. What i find the most interesting is the tension between the classes in great britain.. On the one hand the country is so very modern.. on the other hand it feels like it is still clinging to the last remnants of tradition..  At the center of this lies elizabeth who must reconcile her private concerns for upholding her dignified historical position with her realization that things are changing... As much as i detest people who are handed everything in life.. mirren's deeply felt performance makes the queen's position very real and identifiable.. while i will never feel sorry for the aristocracy in any shape or form (yes it exists in the u.s. to they just call it something other than aristocracy) i can still find their position very interesting to examine.. and that is precisely what this movie does.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am an old guy.  <br />I clicked past Firefly when I hit it scanning throught channels.   <br />My mistake my error, my sadness, or as your generation says \\"my bad\\". <br />I find it hard to understand that Firefly goes down to extinction, but Farscape -- a costume, makeup, stupidity -- continues on. <br />I came to Firefly through the movie Serenity, I had only a passing acquaintance with the series.   <br />What a great body of work!   <br />I have a fantasy that I win the lottery and can afford to underwrite Firefly redux. <br />This is VERY good work; and what does it says about popular culture that a very smart, deft, literate and savvy series dies on the vine?
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Well I read the SPIN interview with Chester about the new CD, and he said he wanted to let people know that the band was capable of \\"more than what was shown in Meteora and Hybrid theory.\\"  He said the same thing at my local radio station where they previewed six tracks.  This of course worried me, I, even as an artist, don't understand the driving need to change somethign that works. <br /> <br />Growing is fine, becoming more experienced and trying new things is fine, but why completely change because you want to show something to people?  Especially, in this sense, when your first two albums were amazing and original in themselves?  The new album is, without a doubt, \\"emo.\\"  Linkin Park was always a bit emo to begin with, some of the lyrics screamed \\"emo\\" but I just chose to ignore it, \\"They still rock.\\"  However, replacing the amazing guitar riffs, Mike Shinoda hiding nearly the entire album, and replacing the hard-hitting drums with simple.  The least unbearable songs on the album are \\"Given Up\\" \\"Bleed It Out\\" \\"No More Sorrow\\" and \\"Hands Held High.\\"  Two of which are basically slightly heavy which makes me remember how Linkin Park once was, and the other two where Mike Shinoda actually raps, one of which soudns more like Fort Minor than Linkin Park. <br /> <br />LP went in the wrong direction here, they'll probably loes a huge portion of their fanbase and perhaps gain a whole new one, I don't know.  I'm certain I can speak for many fans when I say, \\"What the hell, Linkin Park?\\" <br /> <br />Here's to hoping the next CD won't suck.
B000KRNCYY|4.0|I didn't think it was possible to improve on the first DVD and CD of their concerts, but this has.  The fantasy feeling the location creates along with the chosen music is so beautiful.  Costuming, as always is phenomenal, perfectly chosen in color and style for each singer.  The music choices are outstanding and lift your spirits and touch your heart.  I play this CD a lot at my workstation and will continue for many years to come. <br />Thank you Celtic Woman for another inspiration.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth, the planet, is an amazing place we occupy yet know so little about. Planet Earth, the documentary covering the aforementioned planet, is an amazing piece of film making, which covers our planet in a manner not often seen by people. For people with an interest in channels like Discovery, National Geographic, or PBS, this dvd should seriously be considered buying since it is the ultimate nature video, both content and packaging wise.<br /><br />Aside from the vivid picture that is painted by the various locales and animals covered, it is presented in picture and audio clarity that will stimulate the senses to boot.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I saw this movie because I am a Gerard Butler fan to the utmost.  I wasn't disappointed.  He has a true, beautiful ability to capture the essence of characters in other times whether it be myth, legend or fantasy. I am sure most of us studied Beowulf in high school. And probably again, found it ... well to be a little boring and hard to understand. This story sets such a perfect feeling and look for the minds eye, that if studied again, Beowulf might be realized for each of us.  <br /> <br />The look and location of this movie is so well chosen (even though it may also have caused many problems filming) that one definitely knows what life might have been like.  They also capture a feeling of a \\"troll\\" that was totally different than I had ever pictured.  We actually feel for the creature. I can't praise Gerard Butler's acting ability enough for making us believe.  I will always continue to seek out his films. And praise for the director for giving me a mind's eye for this kind of literature and period.
B0002O7XVI|4.0|While taking artistic liberties from the novel , Polanski's Tess is a very entertaining and beautifully filmed movie. The settings and costuming recreate the feeling of Hardy's Wessex as well as any filmed version of his works ever has.<br /><br />Nastassja Kinski was beautiful in the role and although her acting can be somewhat wooden at times she does make a memorable Tess. The rest of the cast make up for her shortcoming by providing outstanding performances.<br /><br />The pace tends to slow in certain parts of the film but if you are a fan of period films loosely based on classics you can do worse than spending some time watching this.

B000001FT0|3.0|This is Steve's third solo album and second with Will Jennings as co songwriter. The main problem with this album is that Steve chose to go it alone instead of using a band. Many of the songs on here would come across better if he was using real players but just about everything is done with synths which gives the album a very dry feeling to me. Several of the songs would come across pretty well had he used a band-Valerie, And I Go, While There's A Candle Burning, Still In The Game and Help Me Angel shows signs of being really good songs.
1400079276|5.0|I actually discovered this book based on an Amazon recommendation and immediately fell in love with Murakami's writing. His writings carry a dreamlike quality, with a large, blurred area between reality and fantasy. We are invited to delve into the psyche of his many characters and explore their personal stregnths, as well as their conflicts. In the end, many of the characters paths converge. But, tantalizingly enough, many questions in the plot and in the characters are left unanswered, giving the reader the challenge of resolving these riddles.  I came away from this book looking for more, and am on my way to reading his other works.
B00080Z53O|5.0|I will be writing a review for a film I have seen months ago. In the first place, what urged me to see this film was the impressiveness of the idea of two women falling in love with a man who is totally disabled. Then, while I was watching it, I had to question the line between life and death and how thin it can be sometimes. What I remember explicitly from the film now is how it presented love. It seems with this film that love is not only in what we do for the others but also in doing the things for the others which they want us to do and being able to see the world with the eyes of the others and being able to understand them. The sea inside is a beautiful film to see..
1587990717|3.0|Entertaining read from a cheerful egomaniac Wall Streeter, recounting misadventures of people in the business and combining his real-world experiences with his broad reading of theory and psychology of randomness.  Many Amazon critics address details but miss the point:  there's a huge amount of theory out there in academia which I suspect almost all traders simply ignore.  So it's fascinating (to me as an academic, anyway) to see what bits of theory impress him as relevant to traders: survivorship bias, data snooping, using Monte Carlo to see alternative futures, for instance.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Daniel Craig's new version of bond is excellent.  This movie start from the beginning with a nice action sequence with the dark humor twist that bond always carries.  This version of bond also has more of a human side, and also show you where he earned his 00 status.  There are also really gritty torture scense where you really can feel the pain, unlike previous corny bond schenes (like a laser going to cut him in half).  Overall, worth a rental, even a purchase.
B00005JPOE|5.0|Every decade or so, a motion picture comes along that captures its subject's heroic essence so perfectly that the film becomes its subject. Such is the case with British director Michael Apted's superb biopic on abolitionist William Wilberforce, passionately portrayed by Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd. <br /> <br />Though Wilberforce is largely unknown to Americans today, this movie is an excellent introduction to the great English parliamentarian who devoted twenty years of his life to eradicating the slave trade throughout the British Empire. (All slavery had been abolished in Great Britain itself by a judicial decision in 1772.) A devoutly religious though thoroughly skeptical man, Wilberforce figured prominently during both the Enlightenment and Britain's Evangelical Revival. <br /> <br />The movie opens as the eighteenth century draws to a close, with Wilberforce not at the beginning of his crusade to end the barbaric practice of slavery, but at what seems to be its most hopeless point. Once one of the youngest members of the House of Commons and a powerful orator, he's now gaunt and dejected, having nearly exhausted his fortune and health in service of his fight. <br /> <br />Riding in a carriage along the muddy road in the rain, he happens upon a driver whipping his fallen horse. Moved to the animal's defense (he was a founding member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), Wilberforce uses simple logic to persuade the driver to cease his brutal flogging, explaining that the horse would more likely regain its strength if left to recover for an hour. This simple exchange, in which he achieves his ideals through practical persuasion, reveals his forceful personality and unyielding integrity, traits that would serve him so well throughout his career as a legislator. <br /> <br />Wilberforce is on his way to the resort town of Bath, There, he hopes, the famous mineral springs will heal his body from the ravages of colitis and addiction to laudanum, an opiate prescribed by his doctors. When he arrives, however, his friends, economist Henry Thornton (Nicholas Farrell) and his wife Marianne (Sylvestra Le Touzel), have a different sort of tonic in mind to cure what ails him. They slyly maneuver their friend into a \\"chance\\" meeting with a ravishingly beautiful young abolitionist and social reformer, Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai). Resenting his friends' manipulations, he at first rebuffs her. But the Thorntons are relentless and soon set him up again, bringing Barbara to dinner at Wilberforce's house. <br /> <br />This time their chemistry is too powerful to deny. Barbara and William launch a long conversation that extends into the wee hours. The subject turns to his tireless but fruitless efforts to stop the slave trade, a story told in flashbacks that constitute the bulk of the film. <br /> <br />Elected to Parliament at twenty-one in 1780, Wilberforce barrels into the House of Commons full of piss and vinegar, taking on all comers with his confrontational debating style and razor-sharp wit. One dewy morning, as he lolls about his lawn, transfixed at the intricacy of God's handiwork in a spider web, he experiences a spiritual epiphany. <br /> <br />After his conversion, Wilberforce's interest in the affairs of state evaporates and he ponders a life of religious contemplation. But to those around him--especially William Pitt the Younger (Benedict Cumberbatch), a friend in Parliament who's angling to become Britain's youngest Prime Minister--Wilberforce's divine spark would be better put to practical use. Pitt asks him, \\"Do you intend to use your beautiful voice to praise the Lord, or to change the world?\\" <br /> <br />Wilberforce isn't convinced until a group of Quaker abolitionists visit one evening. They bring along a liberated slave from the New World, Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour), whose memoirs about his horrific passage from Africa would soon spark public outrage against the peculiar institution. He is shocked by the brand on Equiano's chest (\\"to let you know you no longer belong to God, but to a man,\\" the former slave explains) and by his iron shackles. <br /> <br />\\"We understand you're having problems choosing whether to do the work of God, or the work of a political activist,\\" says radical abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell). Another guest (Georgie Glen) finishes the thought: \\"We humbly suggest that you can do both.\\" <br /> <br />Taking up the battle, Wilberforce introduces a bill every year to abolish the slave trade--and every year the bill is defeated. Yet he perseveres. In a nation where slavery is largely out of sight and mind, he constantly contrives ways to force it into the faces of polite society. He launches petition drives and sponsors meetings where Equiano lectures and sells copies of his book. At a gathering of MPs and their wives aboard a tour boat, the captain weighs anchor alongside a slave ship just returned from a run between Africa and Jamaica. Wilberforce notes that only a third of the original six hundred passengers survived the journey, and exclaims, \\"That smell is the smell of death. Slow, painful death. . . .Breathe it deeply. Take those handkerchiefs away from your noses! There now, remember that smell.\\" <br /> <br />Wilberforce ends his painful reminiscing, too taxed to go on. Barbara is clearly moved, finding inspiration in his struggle. The two passionately talk of their ideals, while the sexual tension silently builds between them. If Barbara's fiery red tresses, flawless peaches-and-cream complexion, and corseted, heaving cleavage weren't sufficient to bag the man, nothing would have stirred him. Without a word spoken of love (not to mention sex), romance blossoms instantly and inevitably. <br /> <br />As morning breaks, the two announce their engagement to their friends. <br /> <br />I like this little touch, coming as it did from out of left field. This is old-fashioned moviemaking at its best, with courtship scenes far more erotically charged than the crassly explicit sex in most movies nowadays. <br /> <br />Their marriage and Barbara's pregnancy become a beautifully simple metaphor for Wilberforce's own regeneration of health and will. He heads back to Parliament to fight the good fight once more. Political intrigue moves front and center as Tories Wilberforce and Pitt, along with the abolitionist Clarkson and Whig MP Charles Fox (Michael Gambon, best known as the Headmaster in the Harry Potter series), put their heads together to plot the end of the slave trade. What follows is the best depiction of political machinations that I've seen since Otto Preminger's political thriller Advise & Consent, based on Allen Drury's novel. Witnessing Wilberforce's ultimate triumph left me nearly breathless. <br /> <br />Costume dramas usually leave me yawning, but not this time. Production designer Charles Wood's painstakingly researched and designed sets lends the movie period authenticity, while Remi Adefarasin's factual cinematography downplays idiosyncratic camera angles and lets the actors and the settings predominate. Writer Steven Knight and director Apted's deft balance of gravitas and levity give the whole business a timeless feel befitting its hero's stature, but without clumsy signposting. <br /> <br />The only drawback, I felt, was that Albert Finney, in an otherwise bravura performance, seemed underused--especially considering his pivotal role as John Newton, the former slave-ship captain who later repented and penned the moving hymn for which the film is named. While the scenes depicting his influence on Wilberforce were succinct and heartrending, they also felt somewhat truncated. <br /> <br />Amazing Grace, whose release was timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Wilberforce's legislative victory, February 23, 1807, has been well received by faithful and secular, conservative and liberal. Still, it generated some criticism on the pages of the Wall Street Journal, whereguest columnist Charlotte Allen found a \\"cover-up\\" of Wilberforce's evangelical Christianity. But the film was not about his religious motives per se; it was about his campaign to end slavery. I think she missed the forest for the trees: The slave-trade abolition was Wilberforce's apotheosis, and that is exactly what Apted put up on the screen. <br /> <br />In a recent interview, producer Patricia Heaton (herself an outspoken, religiously motivated opponent of abortion) described Amazing Grace as an inspiring biography of \\"the Abraham Lincoln of England\\" and as an antidote to our \\"age of such cynicism and despair, particularly about politics and religion.\\" <br /> <br />I agree. William Wilberforce is historically significant for his courageous actions in stopping an inhuman evil. While religion played no small part in motivating those actions, I really doubt that so many talented people would have assembled such an unabashed labor of love as this movie had Wilberforce decided to spend his days contemplating God's grandeur, while ignoring his own potential for personal greatness.
1570627215|5.0|Just as the river's message to Siddhartha, the depth of insights within the pages of this Indian tale can not be articulated. If one considers this book a \\"quick read\\", I might suggest a second reading (and a third). The pages are layered with themes, symbols, and lessons. The tale is a quest for enlightenment. The protaganist's experiences involve love, desire, polarity, time, status, rebirth, freedom, limitations, knowledge, wisdom, values, truth's, and  place (just to name a few). The TOTALITY of all experiences is essentially what aides Siddhartha in finding the path towards UNITY. The river holds many lessons, but these lessons could not have been known without previous life experiences and resulting emotions (sometimes extreme). It is only when Siddhartha understands the river's nature of co-existence and polarity does Siddartha reach Om...<br /><br />Ultimately, this book is not about one thing VERSUS another. It is about the co-existence of polarity for Unity.
B00005JPO8|5.0|Made on a shoestring budget of $2 million, The Lives of Others is the most suspenseful psychological thriller I've seen in a long time, ranking with Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate. What's more, it presents one of the strongest pro-individual, anti-collectivist themes of any movie I've ever seen--all the more surprising because it hails from, of all places, Germany.<br /><br />Its key lies in its title, which seems at first glance drippingly altruistic. The year, appropriately, is 1984, and Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he) is in his twentieth year as an agent of East Germany's dreaded Ministry for State Security, commonly known as \\"Stasi.\\" The \\"shield and sword\\" of the Socialist Unity Party, 100,000 Stasi agents and 200,000 paid informers hold the small Soviet satellite nation in a death grip, monitoring and controlling the lives of its 17 million citizens.<br /><br />Captain Wiesler is a meticulous interrogator, ruthlessly wearing down suspects until they confess. An instructor at the Stasi academy, he trains future agents always to be on guard. \\"The best way to establish guilt or innocence is non-stop interrogation,\\" he instructs his students. \\"The enemies of the state are arrogant. Remember that. \\"<br /><br />A humorlessly menacing man, Wiesler leads a lonely, Spartan existence in an antiseptic, sparsely furnished apartment in a concrete high-rise that houses many fellow agents. One day at the academy, his former classmate and current boss, gregarious Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), drops in with an assignment right up Wiesler's alley. One of their artists appears to be straying from the flock, and Wiesler has been assigned to watch him. However, the subject in question is no dissident, but the most celebrated playwright in East Germany, Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch)--a citizen so loyal to the Party that he believes his is \\"the greatest country on earth.\\"<br /><br />Later that evening,spying from a balcony seat with opera glasses, Wiesler detects the mark of subversiveness on Dreymann's face as he watches the actors onstage performing his play. As Georg beams with proprietary approval, rising to applaud, Wiesler quietly utters to himself a one-word indictment that seals the dramatist's fate: \\"Arrogant.\\"<br /><br />Georg lives with longtime companion Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck)--a radiant brunette who is as celebrated an actress as Georg is a writer (and to whom Wiesler clearly takes a fancy). While they are out of their flat, Wiesler's technical team descends upon their home, bugging the place. \\"Operation Lazlo\\" is now in full swing, and Wiesler and his partner monitor their subjects around the clock from the apartment building's empty attic.<br /><br />At first, the surveillance of Georg and Christa appears fruitless. At a dinner party they host, a hysterical theatrical colleague (Hans-Uwe Bauer), who's suffered detention and psychological torture at Berlin's infamous Hohensch&ouml;nhausen prison, accuses another director of being a Stasi informer. Georg is quick to defend the man against the accusation.<br /><br />Yet, through the course of his work, Wiesler makes some rather ugly discoveries about the investigation. He learns that it was ordered at the behest of national Culture Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), a porcine bureaucrat who's extorted sexual favors from Christa under the threat of blacklisting her. Wiesler also eventually finds his friend Grubitz's schmoozing to be a cover for vicious social climbing and discovers that Grubitz is complicit with Hempf's scheme to use Stasi as a cat's paw to eliminate Georg, his romantic rival.<br /><br />Within Wiesler stirs a realization previously kept repressed: that his unquestioning faith in his country has enabled not his ideal of the perfect socialist state, but the hideous arrogance of avaricious thugs who run everything in the \\"workers' utopia.\\"<br /><br />Where once was theheel-clicking impersonality of a robot, a conscience begins to grow. Wiesler comes to view Georg and Christa and their circle of bohemian friends not as specimens under a microscope, but as real individuals, with hopes and dreams, loves and heartbreaks. Having grown a conscience, he soon also yearns for a heart, as he silently assesses the utter emptiness of his own life.<br /><br />Swept up in his subjects' personal lives, Wiesler's detached spying turns into voyeurism. But it isn't a perverted voyeurism, because, for the first time, the lonely captain catches a glimpse into a world of beauty, poetry, and music that is alien to his two-dimensional existence. Sympathetic to the predicament of these enemies of the state, Wiesler begins covering for them, faking his reports, and remaining silent about Georg's gradual disillusionment with the DDR after an old director friend (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide.<br /><br />He overhears an argument in which Georg confronts Christa with knowledge of her affair with Hempf. Christa--already insecure about her talent--explains that she fears being blacklisted if she breaks it off. Wiesler feels compelled to protect her: He accidentally-on-purpose runs into her in a bar, pretending to be a fan, and tells her that her performances have inspired him. \\"Many people love you for who you are,\\" he says, sincerely. \\"You are even more yourself onstage than you are in real life.\\"<br /><br />Christa dismisses his compliment, telling Wiesler he can't really know her. \\"Did you know that I would sell myself for art?\\" she asks. \\"But you already have art,\\" he counters. \\"That would be a bad deal; you're a great artist.\\"<br /><br />Though his simple compassion, he gives Christa the strength to believe in herself and renounce her extorted affair with Hempf. But in doing so, Wiesler unintentionally sets into motion a nail-biting series of events that leads inexorably both to tragedy and redemption.<br /><br />The Lives of Others is a superb film, top-drawer in every regard. Cathartic and ennobling, it recalls Fahrenheit 451 and We the Living in its presentation of tragic heroes forced to examine their deepest-held yet deeply mistaken principles. Hagen Bogdanski's cinematography is compelling; through subtle differences in lighting he gives Silke Buhr's sets an additional dimension that places the characters in emotional context. Shot with tungsten-balanced film, Georg and Christa's incandescently-lit apartment radiates warmth; yet by capturing with daylight film the omnipresent, fluorescent-lit settings of the Stasi world, Bogdanski renders it cold and bloodless. Gabriel Yared's simple, haunting soundtrack is the perfect evocative counterpart for the action onscreen.<br /><br />The acting is realistic, but never naturalistic. Martina Gedeck is a pleasure to watch, not merely because of her physical beauty, but for her impressive emotional range. Ulrich Tukur's capacity to turn on a dime from regular guy to cold-blooded manipulator is simply scary. And Sebastian Koch combines a physically imposing presence with a gentle, almost fatherly manner, reminding me of a younger Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />But Ulrich M&uuml;he steals the show as Wiesler. I have never seen an actor convey such a broad range of feelings within such narrow parameters. Where a Pacino or a Steiger would explode with ferocity, M&uuml;he underplays, moving the audience with the sudden shift of an eyebrow, the drawing-in of a cheek muscle, or the quiet fall of a teardrop that betrays his sphinx-like façade.<br /><br />M&uuml;he began his acting career in communist East Germany. When government records were opened to the public after German reunification, he learned that his actress wife had been informing on him to the Stasi during the entire six years of their marriage. Clearly, he drew upon this reservoir of traumatic betrayal for this role.<br /><br />The Lives of Others is flawlessly crafted, completely engaging the heart and mind. Most impressive is the fact that it's Henckel von Donnersmarck's feature film debut, released while he was still at the relatively young age of 32. In a recent interview, von Donnersmarck--who saw life behind the Iron Curtain first-hand when he visited family in East Germany as a child--spelled out his thoughts on communist repression as well as independent filmmaking:<br /><br />\\"The [phrase] 'Independent film' makes sense to me only if it means that the director has full artistic control. How could a film be independent otherwise? ... I know that very well from East Germany: Until the Wall came down, the Dictatorship of the Proletariat had Final Cut on everything: novels, plays, films, even paintings. Make no mistake: hardly ever did they actually censor anything. But looking back at the art of those four decades, you can still feel the state in everything, and most of the art of that era is very impersonal and boring. Because the artists censored themselves, often without knowing it.\\"<br /><br />Imagine my surprise, then, when the PC crowd at the recent Academy Awards ceremony--who feted environmental scam-artist Al Gore for his global warming crock-umentary--also bestowed the Best Foreign Language Film award upon The Lives of Others, rather than upon heavily favored Pan's Labyrinth. (I think Lives deserved the nod for Best Motion Picture overall, but I'm not unhappy that the Academy gave that award to director Martin Scorsese's The Departed, a consolation prize for snubbing him so many years.)<br /><br />This cinematic masterpiece is a cause for celebration. Rarely has a filmmaker burst on the scene in such total command of his material. As a directorial debut, The Lives of Others belongs in the same company as Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. I can only hope that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has a Touch of Evil yet to come.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|I first saw this film as part of the Vancouver Film Festival one summer evening in the late sixties.  It engrossed me then and in its VHS form and in this new double cd release.  What's great about this issue is the \\"out takes\\" have been reworked into a companion piece that accompanies the original release in this package.  The commentaries supplied by D.A. Pennebaker and Bob Nieuwerth are fun and insightful.  I loved it. and can't wait for someone to do a similar treatment to \\"Eat The Document\\", Dylan's tour with the Hawks a year and a bit later.

075640407X|5.0|I am looking forward to the next installment in this series.  This one caught me and kept me on the hook from cover to cover.  Kvothe and his story brought back echoes of Earthsea and Sparrowhawk for me while remaining unique and interesting.  If you have read LeGuin's Earthsea books, you can't help but be reminded of them as you make your way through this story. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that this book is well worth the read.  I am very happy to have stumbled over this one in Amazon's reccomendations for me.

B000O75F7C|5.0|5 stars is simply not apt when rating this album. This is a lifetime classic. I have watched with a mixture of hope and despair, the progress of Porcupine Tree from album to album. With this release, they have finally made my heart sing and repaid my hope and belief that there is still genuine world class out there. It is utterly beautiful, thought provoking (I feel exactly the same about the future of mankind and felt quite alone in my views, thanks for helping me realise I'm not just out of touch guys) and more spine-tingling than a night with your fantasy piece. You can play this symphony time and time again and still find yourself on a journey of discovery. It is sublimely ethereal. I have never felt the need to have my nose pressed against the window in expectation of the postman as when I ordered this. The added bonus of Lifeson on here is spookily surprising, at a time when I could not stop playing Rush's \\"Snakes & Arrows\\". Well I have now, because FOABP has blown away all competition, either past or present. Question is: Could anything now stop me playing THIS album? Hmmm, a quandary methinks. Pass this by at your peril.
1401302378|5.0|The Long Tail, studies the phenomenon that is taking place as a result of the internet. In the past, most retailers concentrated in the small part of the products and services that represented the largest chunk of the perceived market.  This, of course, is changing due to the ability of the internet to link all those products that don't sell as much (the long tail) with millions of buyers that are interested in these products but that are not conveniently located in a geographically small area for a traditional retailer to take interest in.  For example, I was recently interested in purchasing a particular office supply product for an old machine that is no longer being sold.   I could not find this item in any of the retailers in my area because retailers have limited shelf space and cannot carry every item available.   As it turns out this machine that I own , and is no longer being made, is owned by thousands of people around the world and all of them need parts for it.   The internet allows a retailer to carry that part to satisfy the need of those few thousands of worldwide clients. The book gives many similar examples in a variety of industries.  This \\"long tail\\" as the author has called it represents a new era of variety and abundance.  As the author writes \\"The era of the one-size-fits-all is ending, and in its place is something new, a market of multitudes\\".  This is an important book for the new economic era that we are entering rapidly. <br />

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Recently after watching the Planet Earth series it gave me a new prospective on this place we call home.  Animals kill for only one reason, survival. Man kills because he can.  Whether you believe in evolution or \\"intelligent\\" design, I have come to the conclusion that the earth would be better if man had never evolved.  Think about it, a beautiful place with no air pollution, no war, no politicians.  <br /> <br />I truly believe that at some point man will become extinct, due to something developed in a test tube, or more likely an all out nuclear war.  And hopefully many millions of years when our sorry planet cools down and that first microbe shows up I hope it never develops beyond the animal kingdom.  They are the only ones who deserve it.  <br />
B000NA1OXY|2.0|I liked Avril Lavigne better when she was a sullen teenager. Throughout this CD, her emotions seem forced, as if Lavigne is trying to convince us that she is happy. Unfortunately, her songs come off as bratty, faux punk that makes me want to turn down the volume. Most of the songs consist of Lavigne screaming the lyrics, and it seems as if \\"Keep Holding On\\" (from the Eragon soundtrack) was tacked for no apparent reason. Maybe Lavigne ran out of songs. . . .  <br /> <br />The only two songs that make this CD salvageable are \\"Contagious\\" and \\"Innocence.\\" Though both songs are cliche and simplistic, they are a welcome reprieve from Lavigne's bratty and almost childish demeanor during the other songs. \\"Contagious\\" is an up-tempo, radio friendly song, which is unfortunately only 2 minutes long. \\"Innocence\\" is a piano ballad where Lavigne's unusual voice shines. Because Lavigne does have a genuine singing talent, songs like \\"Innocence\\" and the similar ballad, \\"Slipped Away,\\" from her last album should appear more than once per CD. Even the powerful \\"I'm with You,\\" from her first CD, has no counterpart here.  <br /> <br />All in all, I'll take my Avril morose and depressed over her past boyfriends. I'm beginning to wonder if her superior first CD will be matched anytime soon.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|We all have many reasons for being interested in movies. Or in film. Or in cinema. Or today in video.  Most of us seek laughter, pathos, or sheer entertainment. Yet since the establishment of American Movie Classics & more particularly Turner Movie Classics, there has been some growth in what might be called aficianados of film -- those who are truly interested in how modern film developed. (There are also groups who have strong interest in one or more actors -- such as Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy -- or certain directors John Ford, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles, or Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />To the true film student, a video copy of the original METROPOLIS is viewed more for its groundbreaking cinematic techniques than for its story alone.  There are many unique techniques & effects in METROPOLIS that have since been give further advancement.  Clearly, we would never have had the STAR WARS series had it not been for the earlier METROPOLIS. Yet METROPOLIS somewhat pales in comparison to any of the STAR WARS series (particularly the first).  Somehow the first of any series is normally the best. And many find  pioneering initial films too simplistic for true appecition.  It is much like watching Johnny Weismuller or Elmo Lincoln as TARZAN & trying to compare this shaky, fuzzy film with a more modern, slck color GREYSTOKE.<br /><br />It may now be difficult to appreciate METROPOLIS or the CABINET of DR, CALIGARI or D. W. Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION in the same way these films were appreciated when issued. Bear in mind, usually we see these classics only on a tiny TV screen.  Consider how much more effective they might have been with sharp prints, on a huge theatre screen, & with majestic musical accompanyment of an organ or perhaps a full symphony orchestra.<br /><br />Also there is no power like the power of an idea encountered the first time. So while I cannot recommand METROPOLIS or any classic silent film to the average film viewer of today completewith mounds of popcorn & gallons of soft drinks, it is a brilliant film. It is still brilliant, & still offers us a world of tomorrow that may yet prove closer to reality than we might wish.<br /><br />Certainly no student of film as a medium should fail to see and to study METROPOLIS. It offers far more film vistas and futuristic life dilemmas than perhaps any other film of its time & type<br /><br />David L.

B000R8YC3G|5.0|Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.<br /><br />But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive,\\" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.<br /><br />Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).<br /><br />Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.<br /><br />\\"Shaun\\" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (\\"Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet...\\")<br /><br />Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.<br /><br />Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.<br /><br />As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? \\"Stone Roses?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"...Second Coming?\\" \\"I liked it.\\" \\"Dire Straits?\\" \\"Chuck it!\\" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.<br /><br />While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|I am amazed they put out a really tight, musical album. <br />Not sure about Dave Mustaine's political statements though, they are quite foggy and just some 'infotaining', angry outbursts from a politically not very educated Mustaine to me. They are not necessarily nationalistic. He just seems indignant at conflicts happening today. <br />I'll overlook that, because this band will never be a political reference to me. I just want energetic, tight, melodic and gripping rock music. <br />I'm just so happy they still seem very dedicated to what they do best: play tight metal.  <br />This is awesome in comparison to the other very popular metal band which has just turned into bored fatigue; they are just some tired millionaires now.  <br />Thanks Dave !!  <br />We owe you a lot, you keep metal for a big audience alive. <br />Big cheers for not kneeling down to trends like the horrible 'nu-metal' or 'rap metal' and stuff like that. <br />You give us hope ! <br />Megadeth humiliates all other big metal bands in my eyes. <br />Real, great, precise, gripping metal !
B000NVIGC0|5.0|The new Wilco is mellow, but I'd hardly call it alt-country.  Instead as you listen you'll be thinking more about Lennon & the Beatles.  That's right, I've said it & it's true!

B000OCXMAE|5.0|Linkin Park latest CD \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is totally awesome!  But then again, I may be a little impartial.  Linkin Park is my favorite band.  I have all of their albums to date.  All I can say is buy it!  I gave this item a five - star despite the three - star on here.  I think this CD is worth a higher review rating.  The album does sound different from their previous projects.
B000P2A256|3.0|It's great to hear artists evolve but I'm not sure that Maroon 5 has moved forward with their second effort.  It's not fair to want Songs About Jane 2 but the band moved away from rock and into the world of pop where instruments are secondary to the mixing board.  I saw them in concert and I was blown away by their talent.  It was also obvious that their audience is young girls.  This CD plays to the same audience that thinks Paris Hilton is interesting news.  If that's you buy this CD.  However I can't help but noticed that the talent that was displayed on the road is lost in the overproduction of a studio session. <br /> <br />They are too good a band for this to be a bad CD and maybe it will grow on me but I doubt it and overall I'm disappointed.  I thought Maroon 5 had the potential to be something special.  I guess I'm going to wait for their third CD with crossed fingers that it will be more interesting than It Won't Be Soon Before Long.

I'm sure ,that if you are checking out the review for this,you pretty much know about the movie.

Having listening to alternate radio,it was perfect. I discovered America,Cans & Brahms and South Side of The Sky.All,of course from Fragile.The album is just top notch and maybe one of the best,if not the best,from Yes. many of the classic artists I listen to,perhaps Yes being the perfect example,is just the right band to dig deep into. Their songs can be complex,but that just makes it the more fun and interesting.So , if you are a Yes fan and wanting to buy your first Yes,I would suggest this one. If you want to go well into the past.90125 has always been my all-time fave,being I am in my 30's.<br /><br />So,go out and get this one.

Live, each Chili Peppers member gets his chance to shine: guitarist John Frusciante plays a few of his own solo tracks, under the glare of a white-hot spotlight; drummer Chad Smith, a tall ball of superhuman energy, gets his own percussion solo three-fourths of the way through the concert; and all three rugged and talented musicians, bassist Flea included, partake in an extended jam session that has little to do with what's on \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" a tremendous double-disc effort that might be the band's best to date.<br /><br />As his band mates create musical bliss on stage, [[ASIN:1401307450 Scar Tissue]]-ridden singer Anthony Kiedis stands back to soak it all in, swaying, dancing and encouraging. I think that, even after all these years in the band and despite everything he's been through, Kiedis is enjoying himself as much as ever: It shows on \\"Stadium Arcadium.\\" His voice is clear, hearty, bold and confident throughout. Kiedis' rapid-fire vocal delivery is as sharp and biting as when he started in the early 1980s (on CD and live), and on such powerful songs as \\"Especially in Michigan\\" and \\"Tell Me Baby,\\" he adeptly, like a vocal chameleon, changes his sound completely. Musically, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" has a bit of everything. Next to great mid-tempo rockers like \\"Dani California,\\" \\"Torture Me\\" and \\"She Looks to Me\\" are danceable, funky rock and roll tracks like \\"Charlie,\\" \\"Hump de Bump,\\" \\"Warlocks\\" and \\"Storm in a Teacup.\\" These two CDs are instantly likable because there truly is something for everyone's taste. Even the songs that aren't as immediate have a lasting, tuneful effect in your head, such as the title track on disc one and \\"21st Century\\" on disc two.<br /><br />Some of the cooler tracks on each CD are the soft, poetic, tender-sounding ones: \\"Strip My Mind\\" contains a retro, 1970s-sounding vocal throughout that gives it true soul; \\"Desecration Smile\\" leads off disc two, and though it's not entirely soft, the opening moments of quiet guitar carry a lot of poignant weight; \\"Hard to Concentrate,\\" a song dedicated to Flea's new marriage, has both a pretty and haunting sound, perfectly capturing the uncertainties of a new life with a new spouse; \\"If\\" has a beautiful folkish sound that is also a bit haunting; finally, \\"Animal Bar\\" has spaced-out elements that remind me of the Smashing Pumpkins' sound in the mid 1990s on [[ASIN:B000000WA4 Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]].<br /><br />My favorite track overall is \\"Wet Sand.\\" It's a deceiving song because it starts off so quiet and unassuming with gentle guitar strums and easy crooning by Kiedis. Slowly, though, the song builds itself up; drums kick in by Smith, the sound gets louder, and Kiedis' tone takes on more intensity. Pretty soon, he's passionately singing, \\"I thought about it/And I brought it out/I'm motivated by the lack of doubt/I'm consecrated but I'm not devout/The mother, the father, the daughter.\\" Great stuff, and it gets more interesting on the end of the track as Kiedis' \\"You don't form in the wet sand\\" refrain melds with a beautiful keyboard and Frusciante's wailing guitar.<br />Producer Rick Rubin kept the Peppers in their natural element, but produced the album in a vibrant, concise way; the varied sounds on \\"Stadium\\" are crystal clear and undiffused with reverb or excessive guitar. However, when Frusciante's guitar does kick in, it's unstoppable. His solos have never sounded meatier, more fluent, or more prominent than on this effort. Chad on drums is just Chad: simply awesome. Same thing goes for Flea on bass. Like any bloated double album by famous rock stars, \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" could have been pared down to its 12 best songs and released as one disc, but where is the fun in that? The truth is, there are few duds on either disc, if any at all, andthe Peppers deserved their chance to try a freewheeling set of CDs that would set the world on fire and perhaps sell out stadiums when out on the brutal road.deserved their chance to try a freewheeling set of CDs that would set the world on fire and perhaps sell out stadiums when out on the brutal road.
0142000663|5.0|I first read this in high school- 40 some years ago- and I am still deeply moved by its power.  Steinbeck never wrote highly polished prose and he liked plebian themes.  It's easy to dismiss him, particularly if you think great novels must be word perfect or concern renowned people and events. In my second reading, Steinbeck's politics and philosophy came through more insistantly than I was aware of as a teenager.<br /><br />The 1930s federal government was as inept as present day FEMA.  The police were as facistic as the Nazis. The banks and rich landowners were as greedy and grasping as Enron execs. The moralistic religious were as closed minded as Fallwell. The public was as whipped up over \\"Reds\\" as it is today over \\"terrorists\\".  The heros are the Joads and other Oakies who have unlimited reserves of ambition, industry and resourcefulness, but by novel's end are reduced to questionable survival.  You know they don't deserve their fate: people that eager to work, that loving and generous, that willing to improve the world should not end up destitute, hunted and starving.<br /><br />Since my first reading I have traveled the length of Route 66 and actually lived in some of the spots wherein the fictional Joads picked peaches. I've encountered numerous Oakies who made the trek and are proud of it. (By now, even the kids of the '30s are gray and choose to remember the best of times.) However, the hard times and nastiness in Grapes of Wrath is not a fabrication. Steinbeck researched the migrant camps extensively and came away with plenty of evidence and strong opinions. He chose to take the lowest point in his American history and expose its faults. In so doing, he also consecrated its common people. The novel also hints at themes that are currently more in vogue: agricultural ecology, the wisdom and strength of women, the need for new economics. America deserves a great novel for every era- this one nailed the dirty thirties.
0743289684|5.0|This book is the best book I have read lately. When I started I could not stop. It is actual, it is informative, it is passionate, it is true and it got me out of my western life on to a trip to Somalia, to Africa, to customs that I suspected but never could get a full grasp. No fiction, facts, but facts delivered with sensitivity, passion, love. After reading the book I want to meet Ayaan Hirsi Ali in person. I feel I know her, she is my daughter, my friend, somebody to look up to because of her courage, her intelligence and the hope she gives to the world. She is moving forward and will make things move forward. She dared to connect with the West and to be true about what she found, choosing education and knowledge versus dogmatism and ignorance. A friend loaned me this book, my husband is reading it, now I am buying it for my friends. This book is a real gift by its content itself. It already spreaded but will continue. People like Ayaan Hirsi are the bridge needed between the Middle East and the West to find effective solutions. She respects her roots, her parents, her friends, her readers, but takes a firm stand and affirmation of the democratic and freedom values that she found in the west even though her life is at stakes.  <br />I advise this book to anybody. It is an eye opener on what is really going on between the middle East and the West.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|After Alligator, one of my favorite records of 2005, I had high hopes for Boxer.  Upon first listen, my first thoughts centered around the fact that the record is much lower key than Alligator with a bit of disappointment in the lack of a real 'shouter' like Abel... after a few more listens, I accepted that Boxer is different than Alligator with its lush instrumentation and added instrumentation (horns, piano).... a few more listens, I was thoroughly convinced that Boxer is better record than Alligator.  Cryptic lyrics via Matt's baritone are still there and Bryan's drumming is as present as ever, but with an added musical complexity and orchastration fitting for such fantastic musicians.  A brilliant record. Try the tracks 'Fake Empire', 'Brainy', 'Slow Show' and 'Racing Like A Pro'... and seek out b-side 'Santa Clara' too...

B000007ODL|5.0|J.J. CALE epitomizes what is the brilliance of simplicity - that less is more, is best. CALE is, perhaps, one of the very few finer singer-songwriter craftsmen who can transport you to other worldly dimensions through his pure, raw, yet polished, finely executed recordings. He takes you by surprise, totally unexpected. I remember hearing him all over the radio during my early teens while his classic albums such as \\"NATURALLY\\" - \\"TROUBADOUR\\" - \\"OKIE\\" - \\"REALLY\\" were getting well deserved, cherry picked AM/FM Radio airplay for his definitive extraterrestialistic tracks such as \\"CRAZY MAMA\\" - \\"LIES\\" - \\"AFTER MIDNIGHT\\", among others. Cale's artistic legend grew by leaps and bounds, and he's not to be omitted from a music lover's library. His recordings will transport you to the stratosphere[and beyond]of your imagination. He leaves a highly memorable impression which, in turn, creates an unfathomed curiosity and intrigue even on the most casual listener of his mysterious vocals and guitar playing from his legendary recordings. \\"VERY BEST OF...\\" easily eclipses Cale's \\"SPECIAL EDITION\\" hits summary and his personal edition on the \\"20th Century Masters Millenium\\"[remastered]series, while it appears to be a pared down one disc version of CALE's expansive, stellar career overview 50 track, two-disc anthology, \\"ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS\\". None of the above mentioned compilations should be dismissed, as all four contain tracks that criss-cross one another, plus various tracks of importance from his almost four decade long catalogue. Any J.J. CALE retrospective is worth every cent and dollar you spend, because every disc flows with gems. Cale's personal versions of both his own 'hits' and famously 'covered' compositions are timeless.
0297851195|2.0|I was expecting something really exceptional based on the reviews and what I got was: Pulp fiction sex, violence, and cheesey plot. I tried it, put it down, tried it again, and put it down for good the second time around. How did this get on the New York Times best seller list?

B00007K02F|3.0|Jane Eyre is a novel I adored in high school. I never sought out the movie since I felt it would taint the way the story sits in my memory. However, the recent release of Charlotte Gainsbourg's 5:55 album sparked my interest in her past artistic works, which are mostly films. I saw The Science of Sleep, which was awesome. Jane Eyre seemed like it'd be good, but the storyline seemed rushed, which was pretty annoying. I could sense the vision was there, but for whatever reason it wasn't executed properly. Oh well, no more novel-based movies for me.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is awesome.  I listen to it all the time and well worth the money.
0060574216|5.0|Yes, it is a bit gimicky, but that just adds to it's charm, and adding humor into a subject that makes everyone tense and emotional only helps lighten the mood. Like another person said in their review, this is an invaluable resource. This book doesn't focus on how to play games with the opposite sex to win them over. I hate books like that. No one is truly happy playing games and pretending to be someone else in order to get the person they want because deep down we want the opposite sex to understand and like us for who we are, and this book helps us learn how to be oursleves and get what we want, what we really want. This book has not only helped me connect more with my boyfriend, but has also allowed me to understand other men in my life, like my father and brother. =) The gimicky language makes reading it more fun.
B000NVIXDW|1.0|A friend let me listen to this CD -- Unfortunately, this MB CD and previous ones just don't cut it for me. Just thankful I've never had to purchase one of his CD's.  Much prefer Harry Connick Jr and even at times, Sinatra over MB's voice.  His so-called charm doesn't appear charmful to me.  I've tried to enjoy his music, but I'm afraid with every CD friend has insisted I listen to, just makes me wonder why there seems to be no change in type of songs sung.
B000J103PC|4.0|.<br />There aren't too many films that feature a successful (and in this case, ruthless) business woman, much less manage to be entertaining in the process. The only other one I can think of is an HBO television movie about Mary Kay, made several years ago. [[ASIN:B00062IZ1S The Battle Of Mary Kay]] Both movies have excellent older actresses in the lead role (Meryl Streep here and Shirley MacLaine as Mary Kay).<br /><br />Knowing nothing about the fashion industry, I also found this film educational, although I tend to doubt the oft-repeated mantra that \\"a million girls want your (Anne Hathaway's) job.\\" It seems to me that most of the intelligent young woman I know have their heads screwed on properly and aren't about to be diverted by an ill-advised foray into a snake pit.<br /><br />Still, this is a entertaining film, and a lot of fun. The ending, as indicated in the above title, is both weak and unbelievable. In fact, the entire film would have been a lot better without the secondary romance between Anne and her boyfriend.<br /><br />If you want to read a knowledgeable and very funny book about the fashion industry, try [[ASIN:0141019670 Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Lustre.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Spectacular filming of wildlife and our beautiful planet which makes you feel like you are right there.

B000P0J02E|5.0|Very, very rarely do I write reviews for music here on Amazon - it is, after all, quite the subjective subject.    But the exception here is that the score to this third installment of the Pirates line of films is absolutely stunning, and so much so that I just have to blabber about it.    (7/21/07: editing this review to add a track-by-track for those interested):    1. Hoist the Colours (7/10): Hauntingly beautiful, and pretty unique as far as Pirates score work goes. Bested by several tracks here, but unique nonetheless.    2. Singapore (6/10): Don't much like this one, personally, but it fits the film well. I will say, though, that there is one standout piece of music around ~1:50 that isn't heard anywhere else in this score, and that in itself, however short, makes it worth a listen.    3. At Wit's End (10/10): GORGEOUS. Dramatic orchestral work turns into the chime theme we first saw long ago, and that itself turns into a pretty driving couple of minutes to bring this track to a close in powerful fashion (yes, the kind that makes you skip back to listen to it over and over).    4. Multiple Jacks (5/10): A necessary track for the film, but in terms of listening, I don't particularly care for it.     5. Up is Down (8/10): Catchy, upbeat theme with a powerful conclusion; among the better tracks of the score, even if it is a little short.    6. I See Dead People in Boats (8/10): Beautiful, somehow more classical-sounding (as if in a Beethoven quartet at a couple of short places...?) piece; extremely well put together with great range of thematic material, and an ending few minutes that will send chills up your spine.    7. The Breathren Court (6/10): Meh. There is a brief choral section right in the middle of this that makes it worth a listen, but beyond that, it's not exactly a highlight.    8. Parlay (6/10): Unique in terms of instrumentation, and with a driving orchestral beat near the end that stands out, but otherwise not terribly noteworthy.    9. Calypso (6/10): Again, choral section in the middle of the piece stands out, but this and the preceding two tracks are quickly eclipsed by the following...    10. What Shall We Die For (10/10): Beautifully put together with a driving string section; this one quickly develops into a leading piece for the climax of the film. The choral work that ends this is another one of those chills-up-the-spine moments for the album, and it blends seamlessly into...    11. I Don't Think Now is the Best Time (10/10): I don't even know where to start. The beginning two minutes of this are iffy, but from around 2:55 to the end at 10:45 or so, it's stunningly beautiful. Once again, choral work around the 6:00 mark makes me wish there were more reprises of that short theme in the score, and... and... oh, the hell with it. Zimmer will be up late at night trying to top this one.    12. One Day (10/10): Another dramatic few minutes of music followed by some charmingly beautiful counterpoint. The other reviewers that mention the new theme here are correct - it's absolutely beautiful.    13. Drink Up Me Hearties (10/10): Perfect end to the film (here's to hoping for a #4...). The return to the theme seen in the middle of \\"Jack Sparrow\\" from the previous score is well-placed, as is the use of the original Pirates theme. Soaring strings lead the orchestra to an end here - how sad to say - and it's magnificently well done.    --    This third score is reason enough to see the film again (and again). It's a far more orchestral set of music than #2 was, and it is arguably better-written in terms of capturing a film in music. There are a few new motifs - charming, gorgeous, awe-inspiring motifs - that are heard from time to time throughout the film, and a decent amount of the thematic material from the first two films reappears here, as well.    Essentially, it is as if Zimmer took all that was right with the scores to Pirates 1 and 2, slightly improved it, added new music that rivaled the best of the previous films, and masterfully added them together. But here, somehow, the whole is most definitely greater than the sum of its parts.    Highly, highly recommended. If the music from the first two films interested you at all, you're bound to love much of this one.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|A good story, however, I wasn't pulled in until the plane crash and yes, it was a very good action scene.  Hanks committment and sacrifice (The weight loss) for this role should be commended.  (I'm still waiting for the heavy-set dude from Lost to lose weight).  I doubt I would have been able to survive four days let alone four plus years.  The bonding with the volleyball was sad yet totally understandable.  His determination to get off the island gives new meaning to \\"never give up\\" and his time adriff at sea was equally heart wrenching and incredibly lucky.  But then when we return to civilization, Chuck is still an island unto himself.  The insensativity of catering seafood as a welcome home party was both amusing and sad.  Kelly unable to see him because it was too emotionally hard had to be one of the most selfish acts I've ever seen.  YOU had it hard?  At that point I didn't want him to reunite with her.  Sure, you've moved on and have a family now-you can explain all that but you at least show up.  I'm not complaining, these things all help you to continuely feel for our hero.  The speech Chuck gave to the theapist about keep breathing sort of reminded me of the same speech from Sleepless in Seattle.  About getting up every morning and breathing in and out.  I swear it's eerily similar.  That last bit of hope at the end of the movie, when he returns the one Fed-ex package confused me.  Because in the begining of the movie wasn't that lady married?  The package she sent to Russia was for her husband.  So was she single now?  I didn't know.  Other than that, Cast Away is an entertaining film that reminds viewers how quickly and unpredictable the tide of life can be.

1592402690|5.0|I recently completed Here, There and Everywhere by Geoff Emerick and Howard Massey. If you're a Beatles fan (not the kind that collects Lennon's used kerchiefs or anything), it's definitely worth the read.<br /><br />To start with, I should say I really dig the Beatles. Why is this important? Because their music wasn't my gateway drug. It was a book entitled The Love You Make by Peter Brown and Steven Gaines. That led to my purchase of Revolver, and then I got ahold of Sgt. Pepper.<br /><br />One day my good friend's pops asked me about my Beatles awakening. I told him what book did it. It was, in fact, from his very shelf.<br /><br />He gave me a slight wizened frown and said, \\"I have the best book on the Beatles ever written. It came out recently. I'll lend it to you, and I never lend my books, so you have to promise you'll return it.\\" With that, he oh-so-delicately entrusted me with Here, There and Everywhere. It still had that new-book smell.<br /><br />I read it. Slowly. Then, as promised, I returned it.<br /><br />I do think it was the best book on the Beatles ever written. And even if it weren't, I'm sufficiently satisfied with the perspective presented that I'm not off mongering for other ones.<br /><br />The Emerick narrative, attentively shaped by Massey, betrays an intimacy with the Beatles that stems from both a technical viewpoint and a time investment that was not always pleasant. He doesn't lend the sense that he's writing about them because he was star-stuck, and he wasn't unduly officious about his position in their world.<br /><br />Emerick describes each of their records with precision and a sharp eye, alongside painstaking accounts of recording equipment that was appearing at the time. (He also broke ground for many different sound elements that are studio stock today.)<br /><br />What's more, there's no parsing of public rumours or sordid details, no pop interpretation of what must have inspired their songs. Emerick's craft, and Massey's construction of the tale that shaped it, are the true gems.<br /><br />The Beatles, their hectic world and their playful experiments with people and music are examined with the same technical lens as was used for their albums. But there's feeling, too. Geoff's life and craft were impacted significantly by the Beatles' travails, and the gravity of his experience rises out of the sum of those parts.<br /><br />The book is clearly not just about them. It's about him, too - possibly most of all.<br /><br />After I read the book I picked up Abbey Road.

B000002B1M|5.0|Nas made a name for himself with the classic \\"Illmatic\\".

Tight verses from Nas, AZ, and Cormega but Foxy Brown has the most memorable verse 5/5 <br />9.The Setup- Classic storytelling from Nas over a dark beat by Havoc. Awesome track 5/5 <br />10.Black Girl Lost- Nice message with good hook 4/5 <br />11.Suspect- Another great storytelling track by Nas 4.5/5 <br />12.Shootouts- Yet Another great example as to why Nas is one of the greatest rappers ever with his clever storytelling 4.5/5 <br />13.Live Nigga Rap- Classic Nas and Mobb deep joint over another dark Havoc beat 4.5/5 <br />14.If I Ruled the World- No better way to end the album than with a Lauryn Hill collaboration. Classic song 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall, \\"It was Written\\" is one of the best albums of 1996 and one of Nas's finest LPs. It's arguably his best post-Illmatic album to date.  There aren't really any flaws besides the fact that it's a bit more commerical than Illmatic, which was a choice by Columbia in order for Nas to sell more records. It is definitely a must have for any Hip Hop fan or fan of Nas from his earlier days.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I have to admit to being disturbed by The Prestigeon some basic levels. Chief among them is that nowhere in the trailer was there any mention of going beyond real world physics. Nor did we get an accurate view of the characters because some really important details were left out.<br /><br />When the trailer first started playing in the theaters, I was really looking forward to it.  I saw Edward Norton's The Illusionist first and really enjoyed it, though it too had a bit of a meandering problem due to the nature of the conflict.  Both films are really small in some ways, microcosms in the world that depend largely on interior story and suffering on part of the characters.  Those are good aspects of story, but these were magicians.  I simply wanted more and bigger magic.  I really wanted more explanation of the tricks period magicians did at the time in The Prestige.<br /><br />The movie is based on the book by Christopher Priest.  Priest is a horror/SF novelist and comic book writer.  He turned in one of the most impressive comic book runs ever when he was writing Black Panther.<br /><br />I have to admit to being pretty much pulled along by the story and the dark natures of the characters as well as the rivalry they followed until the final frames of the movie. Unfortunately, I'd figured most of them out and generally ended up asking myself, why?<br /><br />When Angier's wife was dropped into the water tank, I knew things were going to end badly.  Even prepared for it, though, the gritty realism of the scene was hard to take.<br /><br />Jackman, Bale, Caine, and Johansson delivered standup work in their roles, but they were empty of some real resolution to a degree. Overall, the characters were paper-thin in the finished product and lacked enough flesh and bones to make me care about them much.  I was more concerned with how the illusion was being done and what Angier was doing in Colorado trying to talk to Nikolai Tesla.  Once I had that figured out, I was done with the film to a large extent.  Without true character development, all that was left to see was the trick.<br /><br />The sets and the period piece work were all extremely well done. I felt like I was in Victorian England and in Colorado Springs during those parts of the movie.  I watched the movie on Blu-ray and the scenes were gorgeous.  They were so clear and vivid I felt like I was standing on the street corner or had a seat in the theater where the shows were playing.  The high-def format is absolutely the way to go for the discriminating home theater connoisseur.<br /><br />However, the three storylines that constantly looped and interwove were really much more effort than should have been required for the payoff I received as a viewer. I know that it was necessary to make all the surprises work, but they still made the story more convoluted than it should have been.<br /><br />The Prestige is a good movie. People who haven't seen anything like it will love it. Anyone who loves Christopher Nolan's films (Memento, Batman Begins) will enjoy this one. And there enough historical references to please the armchair historian. Definitely a good film to watch with a group that likes to puzzle things out as they watch a film in the privacy of their own home so they won't disturb other paying viewers who don't like ruminations while watching.ut true character development, all that was left to see was the trick.

I know that it was necessary to make all the surprises work, but they still made the story more convoluted than it should have been.     The Prestige is a good movie. People who haven't seen anything like it will love it. Anyone who loves Christopher Nolan's films (Memento, Batman Begins) will enjoy this one. And there enough historical references to please the armchair historian. Definitely a good film to watch with a group that likes to puzzle things out as they watch a film in the privacy of their own home so they won't disturb other paying viewers who don't like ruminations while watching.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Wow!! What a movie. The best I have ever seen. London is just magic!   <br />Oh, the plot and the actors were very good too, but nothing beats that \\"Get me to London NOW\\" feeling that will fill your heart with every frame you watch. No more words, I have to get to the airport. London, here I come!
1594489505|5.0|I finished it this morning - this book that monopolized my entire day yesterday.  An impulse buy at Costco.  I loved The Kite Runner so took for granted that a book by the same author would be just as good - and I was not disappointed!  This book made me cry in two sections, and I won't give anything away, but I absolutely bawled at the last sentence of the book.  Terrible things happen to the two main characters, but it does have a fairy-tale ending.  As is the case in most fairy tales, the protagonist has to go through hell before happiness can be achieved, and Mr. Hosseini's novel would have made the Brothers Grimm proud.  I just fell in love with this book, and found it to be elegantly written, in a simplistic manner that allowed the inner beauty of Mariam and Laila to shine through without too much adornment.  I have nothing but respect for the writing of Mr. Hosseini and can only hope that he has the ability to crank out masterpieces every few years for many years to come!  The evil troll who gave it a lackluster review in Entertainment Weekly must have left their soul at home that day.

B000002H33|5.0|Cliff Burton was the creative force behind much of Metallica's early music.  He had learned much about music theory and he used it to enhance the ideas that went into Metallica's music.  If you listen to \\"...And Justice For All\\", Metallica's fourth album, you will note a change in the kind of flow the music has in the band's songs.  \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" are just smoother than \\"...Justice.\\"  \\"Master of Puppets\\" is a nearly flawless metal record, containing many of the elements that defined metal in 1986.  After Burton's untimely death in 1986, Metallica was never the same.  For those who are disappointed with Metallica's later efforts just remember that the band to this day has not recovered from the loss of the creative talents of Cliff Burton. <br /> <br />1. Battery - the first song is probably the greatest opener of any Metallica album, even better than \\"Enter Sandman.\\"  The song begins with a nice acoustic intro and builds into a furious thrash song.  Thrash songs are noted for their ripping type feel, a furious force of speed laden metal licks.  The thing that separates Metallica from other bands who've used thrash is that Metallica was able to get full effect from the crunching guitars on their thrash songs like no other band I've heard. <br /> <br />I give this song a 5/5 rating. <br /> <br />2. Master of Puppets - considered by many to be Metallica's best song.  I consider it a close second.  More on that down the page.  Master of Puppets is somewhat thrash but it also has a slow side.  It is one complex piece of music and you can pick up Burton's music theory influence by following the complex riffage and cadence of this song.  It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />This song is a definite 5/5 rating. <br /> <br />3. The Thing that Should Not Be - a song about H.P. Lovecraft's Chtulu monster.  This one is more like doom metal, though not exactly.  It follows well in the tradition of Black Sabbath's song \\"Black Sabbath.\\"  It is a truly eerie song, probably cheesy somewhat to the advanced metal listener.  I suppose it is all in taste.  This remains one of my favorite all time metal songs. <br /> <br />A 5/5 rating. <br /> <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - probably the finest metal song of all time.  It is not thrashy in the truest sense of the word.  It is slowed down compared to \\"Master of Puppets.\\"  But, the rage that comes through from Hetfields vocals and lyrics is all consuming.  I don't know much about music composition, but I think the sense of this song is completely inspiring through all the parts that make up this song. <br /> <br />5/5 <br /> <br />5. Disposable Heroes - I think this song should have been called \\"Back to the Front\\" because that's the punchline.  The song is about the waste of humanity in individual soldiers who are ordered to die for their country.  It is certainly a kind of anti-war song.  It is also one of the best thrash songs I've ever heard.  The drums pound away at you like a dreadful wind. <br /> <br />5/5 <br /> <br />6. Leper Messiah - Ostensibly about corrupting influences preying on people's personal beliefs in order to obtain personal gain.  It is a very good song, but not great-probably the weak point of the album.  What a weakness.  \\"Leper Messiah\\" is powerful in its own right. <br /> <br />4.5/5 <br /> <br />7. Orion - an instrumental, one of four that Metallica has produced.  This song may sum up Cliff Burton's legacy as a musician and music creator.  If there were lyrics applied it would probably be the best song on the album, and I've noted some critics who claim it is the best song Metallica has ever made.  I'd recommend buying \\"Master of Puppets\\" just so an initiate could hear this song. <br /> <br />5/5 <br /> <br />8. Damage, Inc. - a kind of thrash-like song.  This composition is for the thrash purest.  The crunch normally associated with Metallica songs is sacrificed here in order that speed and ripping might be accomplished.  This might be more speed metal than thrash metal, although the distinction imo is minute.  Not the best song on the album but a great closer for what might be the greatest metal album of all time. <br /> <br />5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Master of Puppets\\" is a terrific album, one of the great albums ever made.  If you are a metal fan and you don't have this one yet, what are you waiting for?
8466629408|1.0|This refers to the audio book that I'm forcing myself to finish listening to because I have nothing better at the moment for my long trips. <br /> <br />I don't mind too little plot, or ideology that I might disagree with, but I do insist on some skill at the art of writing.  I could read (or listen to) the phone book if an imaginative lyrical writer had penned it. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Baldacci seems to have precious little of this skill.  Yes, the plot is stupid, the characters cardboard, the dialogue unrealistic.  But it's the \\"fillers\\" that make me want to scream.  A typical page sounds like this: <br /> <br />\\"Where are we?\\" A... asked curiously.   <br />\\"We are in the park\\", B... answered cautiously.   <br />\\"I like it here\\" C... said slowly.   <br />\\"Me, too\\", remarked D... enthusiastically.   <br />\\"Not me\\", E... claimed sadly.   <br /> <br />Etc., etc., etc.  The \\"ly\\" adverbs (sometimes three or more in a paragraph) are so repetitive, so lazy, so unneccessary that they are unintentionally hilarious.   <br /> <br />Whoever wrote that this book sounds as if written by a twelve-year-old was right on the money.  An amateurish, hackneyed piece of trash is what it is.  (And this has nothing to do with the political views that may or may not be intended by the author.  As a Canadian, I am not offended by so-called \\"anti-American\\" views.  My opinions are based strictly on writing style.) <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, James Patterson is the worst popular contemporary writer of the day.  However, I'm now nominating Baldacci as the second worst.
B0000048CP|5.0|Not as good as \\"Hammerheart\\" by a long shot, but still very, very good.  This was my first purchase from Bathory and I was impressed on the first listen.  Bathory has their roots in Black Metal and some of that comes out on this record.  But, this one is also the first of a trilogy of Viking-themed recordings including \\"Hammerheart\\" and \\"Twilight of the Gods.\\"  I was so impressed with what I've heard on this record and \\"Hammerheart\\" that I immediately ordered five of Bathory's other albums.
0974153001|5.0|this is an amazing book, if you were afraid before to try life like figures before this book will get you going. there are step by step information for even the worse scary cat. this has to be one of the very best books on the market today.  love it .
B000002H2H|5.0|\\"Ride the Lightning\\" is an interesting compilation of songs.  There is no particular theme to the album except perhaps sudden death.  Even that can only be loosely applied.  While \\"Master of Puppets\\" is probably a better album, \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is still my favorite Metallica album and a perfect album for the initiate Metallica fan.  This is not because the songs are better than those on \\"Master\\".  It is because the songs here seem to latch on to you and not let go.  As my first Metallica album it would not cease playing.  Everywhere I went, everything I did for several years, this album went right along with me.  Okay, enough melodrama. <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />1. Fight Fire with Fire - a song about the perils of the nuclear standoff between America and the former Soviet Union.  The song was perfect for the time.  It is a simple thrash song with robot like vocals coming from James Hetfield.  I love this song despite the weak execution of the vocals.  It is fast and furious and it was my introduction to metal beyond \\"Motley Crue.\\" <br /> <br />4.5/5 rating. <br /> <br />2. Ride the Lightning - the album's title song is largely overlooked by the Metallica fanbase, probably because of the several great songs that are on this album.  If you buy this album, don't overlook the title song.  Give it the chance it deserves.  It is a great metal song. <br /> <br />5/5 rating. <br /> <br />3. For Whom the Bell Tolls - is probably the song this album is best known for.  The bass intro to the song is one of the most creative things I've ever heard in heavy metal music.  This one is a bit top heavy though, meaning that the most interesting parts happen before the vocals even come on line.  Not to say that the whole song isn't good.  It is great, one of Metallica's all time best efforts, imo.  I wore the grooves off the LP listening to this song. <br /> <br />5/5 rating. <br /> <br />4. Fade to Black -as I understand it Metallica took some flak for introducing so slow and acoustic a song into their repertoire.  Even so, this is one of the great songs in heavy metal history and there is enough heavy crunch in this one to keep it live and listenable as a metal song.  Even so, clearly Metallica intended to write a song that gained a more sympathetic emotion.  The theme of this song is with the darkening of the spirit when something precious has been lost.  The idea is to ask, \\"Is life still worth living?\\"  That's how this song works and it does it very well. <br /> <br />5/5 rating <br /> <br />5. Trapped Under Ice - this song is a bit of a foster child among Metallica's long list of tunes.  It is certainly metal, but it does not display the full talent of the band, imo.  This song interrupts the flow of music on this great album, somewhat.  Even so, it is not a bad song and I'll listen to it every now and then. <br /> <br />3/5 rating. <br /> <br />6. Escape - Another underrated song from this album.  It is very direct and powerful.  Some listeners claim that James Hetfield hates this song.  I don't know if that's true, but it'd be a shame.  While not one of their best, it is a good song. <br /> <br />4.5/5 rating. <br /> <br />7. Creeping Death - one of the highlights of the album.  If you've never watched \\"The Ten Commandments\\" movie then you may not understand what is going on in this song.  It has to do with the curse of death on Egypt's firstborn that caused the exodus of Moses and the Hebrews, as recorded in the Bible.  The song is filled with crunching riffs.  Die!  Die!  Die!  Die!  Don't let the lyric overwhelm you.  This song is so great. <br /> <br />5/5 rating. <br /> <br />8. Call of Ktulu - this is an instrumental and it might be the greatest composition that Metallica has ever created.  Most Metallica fans prefer \\"Orion\\", probably because there is a more concerted crunch on that song.  Nevertheless, \\"Call...\\" is filled with plenty of intense metal riffs.  The song twists and turns its way through a rushing river of sound.  That's the best way I can explain it.  This might be the best song on the album. <br /> <br />5/5 rating. <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />\\"Ride the Lightning\\" is a perfect album for the Metallica initiate.  If you have never heard Metallica, or know someone who might like to hear Metallica for the first time, then I point you in the direction of this great Metallica album.  To the new fan it is an unforgettable listen.  Once hooked you will be addicted for life.

B000NDIAWO|3.0|OK. I do LOVE this album but I must admit, I overrated it before.<br /><br />It's true rating is about 3.5 stars (instead of 4).<br /><br />Why? Because I did love B'Day but what made B'Day so great was that it had ONE Irreplaceable and NO Beautiful Liars.<br /><br />Is Beautiful Liar a bad song? Not necessarily. But it's not a good song either.<br /><br />My favorite songs are probably:<br /><br />Flaws & All<br />Green Light<br />Kitty Kat<br />Irreplaceable (although it is played out by now, haha)<br />Freakum Dress<br /><br />The only Spanish song I liked was Irreemplazable. The rest was just filler to me.<br /><br />I don't really think that you should buy this at all if you have the original B'Day. Just download the cool new songs: Flaws and All and Still In Love (Kissing You).<br /><br />I would love to give this CD 4.5 stars too but it has all the EXTRAS that I didn't want...but then again, I didn't own B'Day so I thought this one was the one to get.<br /><br />end note: I know my review is older, but if you still don't know about this album then know this: the lyrics are uplifting for women and the like but some of them are gonna be obvious mis-steps to many.
B000P2A256|3.0|Maroon 5 created some of the best pop songs this decade with their four single of the debut album Songs about Jane selling over four million copies to date. As great as those for songs were, take them away from the album and what you are left with is a mediocre at best album aside from the great album closer Sweetest Goodbye. But the band has taken its time to record the follow up which was released back in 2002, three years before they picked up the Grammy for Best New Artist. <br /> <br />In the interim, lead singer Adam Levine took over John Mayer role as go to white boy for rappers, appearing on tracks by Kanye West and the Ying Yang Twins, as well as taking part in the Hollywood party scene, being link to more than a few \\"it\\" girls of the moment. Despite the long lay off between albums, the band's sophomore effort, It Won't Be Soon before Long could as well have been called Songs about Jane (or Jessica, Lindsay, etc.) II as the album again is very relationship heavy, leaning again towards the negative sides of them. There are a few quasi-political messages throughout the album, most notable in the first single, Makes Me Wonders, with lines like, \\"Give me something to believe in `cause I don't believe in you anymore,\\" but too many people are reading into the political themes consider the lines, \\"Struggled to memorize the way it felt between your (suggestive lyric deleted),\\" also appear in the song. <br /> <br />The band also lets its influences shine threw more this time around as there are a few Studio 54 era dance tracks that sound like Michael Jackson through the Justin Timberlake filter (If I Never See Your Face Again, Makes Me Wonder) populate the album. Won't Go Home without You could have been what She Will Be Loved may have sounded like had the band had been listening to Every Breath You Take on a loop while recording. Kiwi could be their tribute to early Prince complete with sexual innuendo this time with fruit instead of a car. And I dare you not to think of 3 Doors Down's Kryptonite when listening to the opening chords of Goodnight, Goodnight. <br /> <br />Still nothing here comes close to the upper-echelon of the first record. Harder to Breathe remains the only good fast song the band has done. The band is still at its best when they slow things down like on Nothing Lasts Forever which is built around Levine's vocals from Heard `em Say but the words fit much better here than backing a rap track as well as one of the nicest break up songs ever (take that Clarkson) with Better that We Break. Of course that was most likely just lip services as Levine probably just moved on to the next party girl.
B00004RJ74|1.0|The movie itself is five stars. I love it. The one star is for the lousy non-anamorphic transfer. All other Tarantino movies have been transfered in anamorphic except this one. WHY??
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I bought this when its came out a week ago and when I got it, I watched it with my wife, and my in-law family... they all enjoyed this show very much, we watch it on XBOX 360 add-on HD-DVD player and Optoma HD70 projector and it was flawless but a very few parts in the show which wasn't filmed in HD, but 90% of it is in HD but still amazing and worth buying it, I played it about 25 feet wide on the living room wall, in widescreen size and it was amazing and so detail... very ALIVE and feel like I'm THERE! 5 STARS, I'm looking forward for Blue Planet HD-DVD from Warner Bros. including a bonus IMAX Space show, which will be friggin' awesome!
B00005JO20|5.0|There are very few remakes that live up to the original's reputation and for many good reasons:    1. we already know, more or less, how the story goes.  2. the original is often an almost perfect film which explains why the movie is being remade: many fans could be suckered into seeing an inferior remake.    All great remakes not only must put a spin on the original story but they also must prove that a retelling of the story was necessary.  Off the top of my head I can think of two films that meet this criteria: The Fly (1986) and The Thing (1982).    King Kong (2005) is also one of those rare remakes.    The most refreshing part of this movie is that there is an underlying and always present emotional dimension to this version which the 1933 version lacked.  Unlike most movies today, the characters (especially Anne) are given plenty of time to develop so that we actually care about them when the action gets underway.  The interpersonal relationships certainly have a greater depth than the original.  Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movie is that there is an emotional relationship between Kong and Anne that, I'm thrilled to say, somehow works.  I absolutely loved how they could share something as simple as sunset together and take just enough time to enjoy the wonder of it all.    The characters are more fluid, less one-dimensional, more nonchalant, and just plain better than the original's wooden actors (\\"say, I think I love you\\" as an example).  When I say this, I include King Kong who is a surprisingly good actor (even if he is CGI).  He's not portrayed as some misunderstood creature (like the horrible Godzilla remake) or a ruthless creature (King Kong 1933) but like we would expect: an animal.  Nothing more, nothing less.  At the end of the movie I discovered, to my utter astonishment, that I actually almost cried when the CGI creature was slipping off the Empire State Building.  And I am a 23 year old, 230 pound, 6'3\\", adult male and I never cry at movies!    It's worth mentioning that this film contains some of the best CGI stuff to date and also, what have to be some of the most beautiful scenes in all cinematic history.  I especially loved seeing New York City during the 1930s.    Technically the condensed 1933 version may be a \\"better\\" film but, of the two, I prefer this one.  Go gorilla and get this king-sized monster movie.
0374105235|4.0|Beah's is a heart-rending story - his personal salvation offers that glimmer of hope for redemption, but set against such an impossibly dark background of the decades-long turmoil in Sierra Leone.
B00003CXAT|4.0|Last night I rewatched Jurassic Park for the first time since the '90s.  I still am amazed by the dinosaurs and how real they still look and am charmed by Richard Attenborough's performance as John Hammond.  But I don't like this movie as much as I once did.  So, lest I get some hateful comments, before I list the problems with this movie let me say that I still feel this is a good movie (good, meaning that it's certainly worth a rent and possibly even buying it).  The intent of this review is not to bash this film so much as to challenge the claim that it is a masterpiece.  Here is a list of some of those reasons: <br /> <br />1. Trying to hard to make people laugh (The zingy one-liners):   <br /> <br />\\"What do they got in there? King Kong?\\", \\"Dinosaurs eat men, woman inherits the earth.\\", \\"We're back in the car again\\", \\"God bless you\\".  These are examples of some of the many one-liners from the movie, obviously designed to generate a laugh in the audience.  Some of them work well.  Others not so well.   <br /> <br />I don't think that caustic remarks, in moderation, is a bad thing.  But the movie has so many of these lines that it makes me wonder if the characters are in some sort of unconcious competition with each other to see who can come up with the most biting comment.  The overall effect is that this doesn't feel like how people, who are seeing dinosaurs for the first time in real life, would actually talk. <br /> <br />2. The pompous moral rectitude (manipulating the story to fit the ethics): <br /> <br />\\"We shouldn't tamper with nature because we have no idea what we are getting into because life will find the way.\\"  That's, more or less, a paraphrase by some of the dinosaur experts right before a sequence of events would prove them right, as if they had psychic vision of what was to come.  I must say that, for people who spend their lives studying these fossils, they had a very lukewarm response to what I would expect to be their childhood dreams comingtrue.  I, as a viewer of the movie, seemed to be more excited to see these CGI images than the characters who were, in the movie, seeing actual dinosaurs.  In Spielberg's earlier work (E.T., Close Encounters, Jaws) there wasn't some underlying moral message and it got on just fine. <br /> <br />3. The two kids (especially the girl): <br /> <br />Come on, admit it.  These kids were annoying and were obviously included in the story just to please kids their age and get their parents to bring them to the theater.   <br /> <br />The girl is the worst of the two.  She is supposed to be smarter than her brother but while they were in a car she decides to shine a flashlight at the T-Rex which causes it to move towards them.  INCREDIBLY, the girl continues to shine the flashlight at the T-Rex.  Through Herculian efforts, I managed not to shout \\"turn the f***ing light off\\" at the TV.  The kids are just a burden to everything and everyone. <br /> <br />Alright, I hope that wasn't too brutal.  Besides those small things, I liked the movie and don't regret buying it.  It's just not a masterpiece like many people claim.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Awesome documentaries with HD beautifull pictures from our planet. You learn a lot with these DVDs. The best thing you can show to your kids... and to yourself! <br />Also I think that this BBC version is better than the discovery Channel one, mainly because of the voice of David Attenborough. <br />A MUST to have!
B00004TDTO|5.0|When I was much younger I could watch Jaws again and again.  I don't know how many Friday nights I spent rewatching Jaws but there must have been many.  That tone, dah-dah dah-dah, was ingrained in my mind.  Even though I knew exactly what would happen my adrenaline would always rise during certain parts of the film (the severed head, the girl being tossed around during the opening sequence, and Chief Brody's last desperate attempt to kill the monster shark, etc.)  This is essentially a perfect film where the characters are developed enough so that we care about them when they are put in peril.    Bravo recently made a television program about \\"100 scariest\\" movies ever made and it ranked Jaws #1, putting it ahead of movies like Alien (#2), The Excorcist (#3), and Psycho (#4).  While many people would disagree that this is the scariest movie ever made, Jaws makes it to virtually everyone's scariest top 10 list.  You cannot possibly call yourself a horror film buff without owning this.    But before you buy this, just one note of caution: Don't take this film too seriously.  The one sad thing about this film is that it was so effectively scary that it led to the deaths of many great whites around the world by ignorant people who viewed them as mindless killers.  In reality, these creatures do not actively seek to kill humans.  Most hate the taste of our bony bodies and, of the few times they do attack humans, it's usually because they mistake them for sea lions which they like to eat.    With that in mind, sit back, relax and get ready to watch the greatest shark movie ever made.
1594481717|5.0|Very insighful and a must read for IT folks trying to keep up with an ever changing work place.  We can't just write code anymore we have to bring value.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This was a bad movie.  Too much CGI, too much stiff acting, too much ridiculous stuff (Anakin almost accidentally destroying a federation trade ship), many unwelcome revelations about the force (the metachlorides), and featuring THE most annoying character in the star wars universe (yousa know who I mean).    Star Wars jumped the shark with this movie and it never truly recovered.  Though I liked RoTS and thought AoTC was okay, I could not truly take them seriously like the original trilogy partly because this crappy movie sucked all credibility out of the franchise. This gets my vote for the WORST Star Wars movie ever made.
0316018953|5.0|This shortened novel is the completed serialization Connelly did for the NY Times. It is a short but entertaining look at Harry Bosch after Echo Park. New situation, new partner. And it does not fail his readers. Harry's character still acts with his own sense of honor and duty. Never taking his eyes off of the goal - first and foremost a murder - a scientist who was coerced to steal radioactive substances to save his wife's life, is murdered after he comes through with his part of the deal. With a quantity of radioactive materials not accounted for, the FBI and National Security are called in. Piecing together the actions and the facts are what Harry does best, and he doesn't fail us.<br /><br />From start to end, the book covers about 12 hours real time - and that was fascinating to see Harry in action under time constraints.<br /><br />While this book may not have had the time for the usual complexities, Overlook comes through for us - until we get the next full length adventure.

B00006CXSS|5.0|An excellent DVD to own, especially if you enjoy history.  I enjoyed watching it many times over on HBO, so I decided to purchase it.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|Reading the book, then watching the movie helped to clarify some sketchy areas for me.  For instance, if I didn't understand a part in the book, watching the movie helped to explain what had happened.  As far as characterization goes, some were better than others.  Gatsby was just as I imagined as were Nick and Jordan.  I felt that the actors who played Gatsby, Nick, and Jordan portrayed F. Scott Fitzgerald's characters in the book.  However I was slightly disappointed with Daisy, Myrtle, and Tom.  In my opinion, the actor who played Tom didn't seem to fit the part.  When I read the book, I pictured Tom to be more controlling and meaner towards Daisy; I also pictured him better looking and tougher than what he was.  For me, Myrtle was the worst.  In the movie she was kind of dirty and not very attractive.  I expected her to have some potential, due to the fact that she was able to catch Tom's eye.  Daisy's charcter was not bad, but could have been better.  In the book, Daisy seemed to be more intelligent than how she was portrayed in the movie.  All together the movie wasnt bad, but it wasn't great, for me it was average.  But where this movie did shine was in the costumes and scenery.  They both portrayed the twenties well.  Overall I felt that the book was better than the movie.  Reading the book allowed you to picture the charcters how you wanted and what they looked like, whereas watching the movie you were stuck with how they looked and acted.

0743455967|5.0|I'm taking a college Essay class and as soon as I mentioned Stephen Kings name to my instructor, I could see his distaste.  He claims that truly great authors take time to write a novel and that S.K. is like a fast food restaurant, just turning them out like quarter pounders.  After turning in a few assignments, applying what I've learned from this book, I've received high marks and I can say that without reading, \\"On Writing\\", I would not have excelled nearly as well as I have. I told my instructor this and he just scoffs.  Jealousy I think since most English teachers are just wannabe authors.   Not only have I read around three quarters of S.K. work but have read quite a few more than once and he is still my favorite author.  <br />I truly enjoyed how S.K. made this a semi autobiographical/creative writing lesson; at least how it works for him.  He does not say that this is the way that it should be done, but this is how it works for him and if it works for you then great. <br />I would truly recommend this to anyone curiously interested in writing short stories or even extended novels and have read it myself twice and read things that I missed the first time through.
B000P2A256|5.0|Surprise, surprise!  This is the best pop album of the year!  \\"I Won't Go Home Without You\\", a tune that sounds like a cross between The Police's \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and a melodic Beatles tune, is worth the price of admission.  Another favorite of mine is \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\", an awesome mid-tempo, bittersweet pop gem.  There's also \\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\", an 80's like, Michael Jackson-like funky tune, and of course, the first single, \\"Make Me Wonder\\".<br /><br />There are at least 5 or 6 top 10 tunes in this album, I think.  Definitely a CD worth owning.

0307237699|4.0|Senator Obama is what this country needs to represent itself in the new global age.   He is not perfect but he is many steps beyond what we have suffered through since Al Gore was cheated out of his presidency. <br /> <br />I was very skeptical of this book even though I liked Obama a lot before picking it up.  I was biased already, but I tried to see it as only propaganda and ghost writing.  I wanted to be critical and see it through the eyes of those that are already corrupted by the establishment. <br /> <br /> However, I failed this initial plan.   Instead I find the book very personal at times and a pleasure to read.   Obama has many terrific insights and he at least makes a great attempt at coming across as a student of history and a passionate devotee to the founding father's principles of this country and the government it tried to draft a few generations back.    Obama gives us some other perspectives though I think that you can only give lipservice and hand waiving from other leaders in this country.
B00005NC66|4.0|Breathless - in it's lean, pared down, gritty realism - is a seminal movie. Michel Poiccard (Jean Paul Belmondo) is a disaffected youth, a sort of French James Dean, who steals a car, shoots a policeman, then goes on the run. Whilst trying to track down money he is owed so he can escape to Italy, he pursues his affair with the beautiful, bird like Patricia by breaking into her hotel room. In a memorable, drawn out scene, the two lovers flirt and fight amongst the pillows, discussing the deeply philosophical and the trite and trivial. The dialogue sequence in this scene is a superb piece of cinematic realism. The detail of Breathless - Michel's white shirt and Bogart style cigarette and hat combo, Patricia's striped dresses, he city of Paris, a sharp jazz score, the doomed forebodings of noir - raise this film up to its position as Flicks magazine puts it: the yardstick of celluloid cool.
B000002H33|5.0|Geez, this is my first Amazon review in a while, so looks like I have some catching up to do.<br /><br />INTRODUCTION: In the 1980's, the 2nd greatest metal group Metallica had formed. The members were James Hetfield on Lead vocals and guitar, Kirk Hammett on Guitar, Cliff Burton on Bass, and Lars Ulrich on drums. This is the last album to feature Cliff Burton (R.I.P.).<br /><br />1. BATTERY- 10/10- A great intro, begins with Flememco guitars, and leads into a pulsepounding Metal epic. My 2nd favorite song they made.<br /><br />2. MASTER OF PUPPETS- 10/10- The best song ever! Great guitars, and awesome lyrics about drug abuse. One of the coolest guitar solos.<br /><br />3. THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE- 10/10- Great song! I can't get over it! I like the dreary mood of this song.<br /><br />4. WELCOME HOME (Sanitarium)- 10/10- Awesome! Can't say more.<br /><br />5. DISPOSEABLE HEROES- 10/10- Catchy fast paced song.<br /><br />6. LEPER MESSIAH- 10/10- One of the best songs ever! So thrashy and catchy.<br /><br />7. ORION- 10/10- The best instrumental ever. Turns different halfway, which is why I love it!<br /><br />8. DAMAGE INC.- 10/10- Great ending to the album! Why did St. Anger steal the chorus?<br /><br />So this is 'Tallica's best effort, highly reccomended!
B000O76TAE|5.0|This is a undoubtably a classic of our time. Now, with the new European packaging of \\"steelbook\\", this new DVD edition serves as a better investment and sure value-holding collection. The \\"steelbook\\" design has been introduced on several DVD sets in Germany and other European nations over the last several years. With movies like Ice Age 2 and The Grudge 2 just recently gone Steelbook form overseas, the new inovative packaging trend has just reach the US with the introduction of 9 previously released special edition sets--including the 2-Disc Collector's Edition of Cast Away. <br /> <br />Although this new packaging DVD set is not released, or at least scheduled to be, at the time I'm writing this review, I do assure you that I do have a copy of the Steelbook edition on hand (along with The Day After Tomorrow Steelbook as well). It is a nicely packaged set that really does bring more value to the collection. It's medal on the outside, with clear plastic on the inside. The bind itself is actually part of the plastic inside the two metal tin-like lids that close the book up, but it is very strong and plenty sturdy enough to balance the weight of the metal lids. This is not like a DVD case inside of a tin packaging that many of us have come to know over the years, but really both ideas placed into one packaging. The discs will surely be far better protected than the snapcases, keepcases, and digipaks that we know best. <br /> <br />The Steelbook edition of Cast Away is the same, but now OOP, 2-disc Special Collector's Edition released a couple of years ago by 20th Century Fox. Disc 1 is the exact same as the single released version of the movie (in Widescreen). Disc 2 contains the same bonus features as released before. For those wanting the 2-disc experience, you now have a second chance to grasp onto it (and the other movies) with a more lasting alternative. <br /> <br />With this newly packaged beautiful set, I do hope that other movies soon will be released after these nine come out June 5th. So far, these movies seem to be geared more toward the fellas with more action packaged/disasterous themed movies. Hopefully, we'll begin to see other movies like Ice Age 2, Dirty Dancing, and even Eragon come out in this new \\"Steelbook\\" format just as they have overseas.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|I think much of what I'm about to say has been said, but I'd like to throw my 2-cents in... I'll feel much better.  While the first 2 albums by Linkin Park are high on my fav's list, this one won't come close.  Some of the songs are fun, nice melodies, even harmonies, but ANOTHER political album?!   GET OVER IT!  Come on!  This pessimistic tone in much of todays music is frankly overdone and predictable.  The funny part of it to me is how this album will sound in about 3 years... pointless.  What I liked about the other albums is how they spoke to me personally.  This one is quite selfish sounding.  Didn't they also say they'd never swear in their albums; they could speak their thoughts more eloquently?  Now they just look like they've caved to peer pressure.  What was to make them sound unique has made them sound like everyone else.  Go back to your old ways, bring back Mr. Han, give us something to rave about, again!

0743298020|5.0|Every word in The Thirteenth Tale is wonderfully used to describe feelings and events in vivid detail.  The mystery within the story is revealed slowly and perfectly to us one word at a time.  As we get to know the protagonist, we realize that she experiences many thoughts that we all share from time to time, but these thoughts remain unarticulated because they happen before we even know they are there.  Diane Setterfield has the rare gift of being able to notice and record these seemingly insigificant moments (such as seeing rain on a windowpane) and then putting them into words for us. I will never see raindrops on a window pane in the same way again.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Well done but very graphically (and necessarily so) violent film by Clint Eastwood, telling us the story of the battle for this island during WW2---from the Japanese p.o.v.    <br />The title refers to the letters these soldiers received, or tried to send.  In this sense, they are the same as the soldiers coming to attack them.  Eastwood, to his credit, does not try to push your buttons in regard to the Japanese men on the island.   Internal conflicts abound among the soldiers, who have differing opinions of honor, duty, and dying for one's country.  You can't help but feel some sympathy for these fellows, who spend their last days with no food, water, or ammo.
0060763280|5.0|This is one of the most enlightening books I've ever had the joy of reading.  It allows the reader to evalute their own misconceptions of earning and managing money.  Anyone can benefit from the financial <br />\\"lessons\\" Harv teaches about wealth.
0679745653|5.0|The best introduction to Capote's work, in my opinion. Holly Golightly is a dream of New York City, a figure that so many millions of people, male and female, have come to Manhattan to try to be. Those amoral jerks! (ha ha) Capote's ability to sustain this dream in prose, even though Holly is not much more than a stylish wh*re, is what has kept this short, breezy-yet-tragic postwar novel in print for almost 50 years. A classic.<br /><br />I'll always love Audrey Hepburn in the movie (though let's admit it, she's too old for the part), and Moon River is a great song, but I'm sorry that Fassbinder couldn't have done his own movie adaptation. THAT would have been something!
1592402038|3.0|I was a little concerned about this book when I first started it.  Perhaps to make a point, or perhaps to seem a little controversial in order to sell more books, Truss starts out with pure diatribe against sloppy punctuation skills.  Mostly, she targets supermarket-style punctuation errors, but in her chapter on apostrophes she began with what she deemed useless apostrophe errors, which after a while felt overly restrictive and downright racist.  Some of her references to apostrophe errors seemed to fall into the area of non-Anglican names, where apostrophes are used to separate vowels that are separated when pronounced.  Her diatribe also seemed to have little consideration for style, merely for rules of usage.<br /><br />I did enjoy the level of research in this book--to learn, for example, who invented italic script and semi-colons, and to get some sense of the evolution of punctuation--but the pro-stickler cheerleading seemed to be missing the point of punctuation altogether.<br /><br />Fortunately, the later chapters improve in their consideration of style and are a little less hung-up on rules.  Perhaps the hardcore stickler attitude was something infused to put some gimmick to the book--after all, the book was a phenomenal success.  But as a book that provides an education on punctuation, I would say that it has some interesting moments, but merely reinforces the myth of the steadfast English teacher who looks at punctuation before language rather than vice versa, and does it more to sell than to inform.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Talented Michael Buble and his magnificent orchestrations (Look at how great Nelson Riddle was for Sinatra!) are back with more lovely renditions of a variety of songs.  Thematically, each track seems to shift gears, so it's unfortunate that the listener can't settle into one particular mood for too long.  And the CD ends on a soft, sentimental side that leaves you wishing there were just one or two more upbeat songs still to come.<br /><br />He is undoubtedly one the best singers/song stylists on today's music scene.
B000HA4WT8|2.0|Like many \\"Japan Movies\\" however, this is not a movie about Japan as much as Japan serving as an exotic location against which Westerners have their own adventures. There was a period around the turn of the century when most Western books and movies about Asia were simply exotic backdrops for stories about Europeans, and it appears 100 years later we are not completely out of that era yet. <br /> <br />Not, I hasten to add before I get too high on my liberal horse, that there is anything inherently wrong with that. For that matter, Japanese media often employs the same device, and Japanese comics and movies are often filled with stories of Japanese people going to America and having all sorts of bizarre adventures. <br /> <br />But it is noticeable that none of the main characters in this movie are Japanese. The hero is a white American, the best friend character is a black American, the mentor is a Chinese American, and the love interest is an Australian of indeterminate ethnicity. A multi-cultural cast certainly, but the rest of the Japanese characters are mostly reduced to the background. More is the pity because the producers were able to get a few of Japanese most recognized television talents to make cameos on this film, and then only gave them bit parts. <br /> <br />In fact the only Japanese who figure into this story at all are the villains. I remember thinking the first film in the series, with its Chinese bad guys, was drifting dangerously close to reviving the old stereotype of the swarthy Asian villain. This film again has chosen to focus on a white protagonist battling slimy Asian gangs. <br /> <br />However I am hesitant to call racism too quickly, especially since the director of this film and many of the crew are Asian American themselves. Instead, let us just say that the film has some unfortunate missed opportunities, and it could have been a lot better if it had done a better job of integrating its Japanese cast. <br /> <br />As for my critique of the film's portrayal of Japan: <br />The entire film is set in Tokyo, which I have thus far spent appalling little time in, despite my 5 years in Japan (mostly due to my hatred of crowds). Tokyo is to some extent almost a separate country, and the rest of Japan views it in much the same way we Midwesterners view California, as that crazy place where anything goes, fashion and youth culture are at their cutting edge, and nobody has any morals. <br /> <br />If you watch the DVD, the director's commentary is pretty interesting, because he talks about some of the things he exaggerated, and some of the things he didn't. (For example, given the fact that Tokyo is one huge traffic Jam, most of these car racing scenes that take place in the movie are pretty laughable). <br />Also it turns out that, like \\"Lost in Translation\\", this film was apparently plagued by Japan's restrictive rules regarding film permits, and a lot of the Tokyo footage they either had to take illegally, or film in L.A. on sets that recreated Tokyo. <br /> <br />The school uniforms, school slippers, and look of the school was all pretty much dead on. However in my experience, a tall white guy cannot walk into a classroom in Japan without causing, if not massive disruption, at least a considerable show of interest and questions. I found it slightly surprising that he could simply walk into the classroom and be accepted as a new student, but then I live out in the countryside in Kyushu. I'm sure Tokyo is a lot more sophisticated and international. <br /> <br />Of course, the big point of this movie is not Japan or the cast, but the cars.  <br />I will say this though, I now have a whole new appreciation for \\"Crash\\" by J.G. Ballard. When he I read his book about sexual eroticism and car crashes, I thought he was only being metaphorical about our society's addiction to automobiles. 15 minutes into this movie, I realized that some people, like the target audience for these films, do seem to literally equate huge car crashes with pretty girls and sexual arousal. <br />
0938045695|5.0|I am not too familiar with the other items out there but kettlebells are unheard of mostly in Australia. I have seen a couple of other videos and looked up plenty of information on the internet and I have had great success with Kettlebells in general for weight loss. They are truly an amazing workout and I find easy to use and stay motivated with. <br /> <br />I found this to be a good \\"Back to Basics\\" book. I was going through a stage of learning a lot of the exercises and I found this channelled and reminded me of the basics of good swings, cleans and presses, and how these basic exercises can give you an amazing workout on their own. <br /> <br />It's a well put together book with plenty of photos and reminders about technique. I think it covers technique better than one of the other videos I have. It's probably a good book in conjunction with a video and some basic instruction as it is important to see the technique as well as read about it and be shown how to do things correctly. You could injure yourself if you are new to exercise and trying to throw one of these around. <br /> <br />I have gone back to \\"learning\\" and working with my 16kg Kettlebell until I get a better grasp on it before switching up to me 24kg. Technique is very important and this book teachers good technique. <br /> <br />The bit of history is also good to read about in how the kettlebells are produced and a bit of history on the strongmen of the former USSR. <br /> <br />Great Book.
B000001FFJ|5.0|An album this far of left field can rarely be described as addictive, but I've played this one about a million times and I never get tired of it. I have to admit though, I have purchased \\"Rain Dogs\\" three times in my life and ended up selling it the first two times I owned it because I just didn't get it. I don't think I was open minded enough to listen to this one the whole way through in my teen years, but the third time was a charm and this disc got its hooks into me completely. On \\"Rain Dogs\\" Waits continued to experiment with the unique instrumentation he used on his previous release \\"Swordfishtrombones\\" and really took it to the next level, the result being one of his best albums. Not to mention he employed the likes of Keith Richards, G.E. Smith, and Robert Quine (a Richard Hell and the Voidoids and Lou Reed alumnus), which didn't hurt. While some of the songs off this disc are bizarre and abrasive, there are others that are so accessible one wonders why they didn't take the world by storm; for every \\"Singapore\\" there is a \\"Time\\", for every \\"Clap Hands\\" there is a \\"Downtown Train\\". I can't think of any other album from the 1980's which has aged this well and is loaded with so many great songs and great moments: the classic Keith Richards riffs on \\"Union Square\\", the screeching \\"Midtown\\", (which would have been perfect for a car chase scene in the movies), the bluesy groove of \\"Gun Street Girl\\" (which is achieved through such minimal instrumentation that it's genius), the explosive vocal Waits delivers on \\"Anywhere I Lay My Head\\" which threatens to blow your stereo speakers out with its intensity, the country feel to \\"Blind Love\\" which features Waits' gravelly voice backed by Keith Richards' harmonies, and the list could go on and on. Like most of Waits' releases \\"Rain Dogs\\" was critically acclaimed but didn't sell in big numbers and has gone on to achieve a large cult following. It stands as one of his best albums, and I would include it as one of my favorite albums of all time. Once it gets its hooks into you nothing else will hit the spot the way \\"Rain Dogs\\" does. Also recommended if you like this one is the live album \\"Big Time\\", where Waits bends and twists the arrangements of some of the songs off this album with great results.albums of all time.

1590171993|4.0|Rejecting the plotless postmodern novel, John Williams believes the novel should deliver a good story.  Stoner does tell the sad story of a man's everyday life.  Although this life has high points, and the story is told beautifully, it plays in one low key.  The reader knows that the story has to end as it does in classic tragedy.  Romeo and Juliet both must die; Anna Karenina must be killed by the train, ect.  This novel, however, just leaves me depressed at the sadness of ordinary life.  The story has psychological intensity, but the text somehow does not deliver.  Rather than the keen stab of emotion imparted by a tragedy, this novel produces the dull pain of a toothache.
B000P2A256|2.0|I loved their first single so I decided to pick up the cd. Most of the songs are meaningless to me and the lyrics are bordering immature.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|What do you get when you reinvest the millions of dollars you made off of your last two smash hit albums and 18 months of studio time with world famous producer Rick Rubin?  The answer is Linkin Park's \\"Minutes to Midnight\\", which Linkin Park claims is going to be \\"the new sound\\" of their album since they \\"hate nu-metal now\\". <br /> <br />I expected something amazing, a filled CD of experimental positive upbeat jams such as what 311 did with Transistor back in 1997 or maybe even a double album featuring one disc of Mike and one disc of Chester like what Outkast did with Speakerboxx and The Love Below. <br /> <br />Instead of taking their existing sound, enhancing it and extending it, they decided to scrap nearly everything that made them unique in the first place.  Long gone is the dual interchangable vocal attack of Chester and Mike.  The proverbial icing on Linkin Park's cake...that of Mr. Hahn's phenomenal turntablism skills have taken away.  Perhaps he was out buying a new lab coat and a cowboy hat during the making of this album?  In place of these things we get a depressing, slow, emo-like sound that could induce sleep in even the worst insomniacs. <br /> <br />Unnecessary f-bombs are dropped in some of the songs on the album which show a lack of creativity.  Some of the songs have political messages which is a plus because it does show some maturity.  However, these messages are a few years too late and could have been handled in a more hard-hitting fashion such as how the Beastie Boys did it with To The 5 Boroughs.  I understand Linkin Park wanted to change themselves, but this album reeks of incongruency and I think is a result of them no longer \\"being hungry\\" like most artists are before getting their first major record deal. <br /> <br />The album isn't an entire failure, as the songs Leave Out All The Rest, No More Sorrow and Bleed It Out seem to have some staying power, but can only be considered b-sides when compared to the masterpieces that were on all of their previous efforts (and that includes everything from Hybrid Theory EP to Shinoda's Fort Minor side project). <br /> <br />I think the best way to sum things up is to refer to \\"Hit The Floor\\" from Meteora. <br /> <br />One minute you're on top (Linkin Park with Hybrid Theory and Meteora) <br />The next you're not (Minutes to Midnight released) <br />Watch it drop (LP's album sales) <br />Making your heart stop (Because they spent 18 months on this???) <br />Just before you hit the floor (Minutes to Midnight is so depressing you slit your wrists and died on the floor) <br />One minute you're on top <br />The next you're not <br />Missed your shot (at making an amazing new album that will stand the test of time like their other albums) <br />Making your heart stop  <br />You think you won (LP thinks their new sound is great, but it is not) <br /> <br />And then it's all gone (LP's fanbase leaves them...for now...) <br />

B000O178BY|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for NIN or anyone to produce a more cohesive CD than Pretty Hate Machine but Trent Reznor has done it.  The story he tells and the way he tells it is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />God Given, Survivalism, and Capital G are so good they are dangerous.  Seriously, I'm afraid to listen to them while I drive because I might go so fast I'll cause an accident.  There are a few slower songs, which I would normally flip through, but on this CD.  It's as if the slower songs are strategically placed to give listeners an opportunity to take a breath.<br /><br />Truely awesome.  A must have for any fan of good music.

The portion that they told was very good, but I was expecting more.
1400064287|5.0|This book is an enjoyable read whether or not you use its principles.  The stories and concrete examples are fun to read and with their diversity, there is sure to be one that you can relate to.  The specific case studies that you interact with are a mixed bag, some are very good, others are not as easy to understand.  Their 6 principles for stickiness are easiy grasped (they may even seem obvious), yet so often ignored.  This book will be most helpful to presenters, communicators, marketers, and educators, but it contains plenty for the casual reader as well. <br />If you enjoyed the book, I would also recommend the monthly article they write for Fast Company magazine which contains even moree examples of the principles of their book.
1594489505|3.0|In 2004 I read The Kite Runner.  I LOVED that book.  Set it Afghanistan and then later in the United States, we met a young boy who goes through a life-changing incident at a kite-running competition and later uncovers some surprising family secrets.  It was an immediate best seller and I certainly understand why.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is this author's second novel.  It tries hard to repeat the freshness and excitement of the first book.  Sadly, it misses the mark.<br /><br />This book tells the stories of two women in Afghanistan.  It also tries to give the reader some historical context.  There doesn't seem to be any joy in these women's lives.  Mostly there is unhappiness and helplessness at the hands of men.  I found myself feeling sorry for both of them and also for the whole country that has been plunged into despair since the Taliban.  But make no mistake; life for women was pretty bad even before then.  And the author seems to exploit all this for a Western audience.<br /><br />Life is harsh for everybody in this book.  But it is particular hard for the women who are married to brutal men.  Women are prisoners and cannot escape their harsh husbands or the culture.  There didn't seem to be any moment of pleasure that wasn't immediately snatched away.<br /><br />I expect this book will be a best seller.  There certainly is a lot of publicity about it.  It's too predictable though and I just couldn't wait for it to end.  Sorry, but I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.  Read \\"The Kite Runner\\" instead.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|As a big Wilco fan, I'll be the first to admit that their sound has changed drastically, and more than once.  Most fans (myself included) would argue that it's been a fun ride, but it does make it difficult to know which Wilco you're going to get when you pick up a new albumn.  I am delighted to report that this is the \\"Being There\\" Wilco.  YHF and GIB were great albumns, and I don't want to detract from that.  That being said, I could shave 10 minutes of buildup and extended feedback off of each of those albumns and I don't think anything would be lost.  Sky Blue Sky feels to me like Wilco finally got over that experimental binge and revisited the simple, hauntung, sound they loved.
B00005JPFH|2.0|The epic hubris displayed by director Sam Raimi in this latest (and one would hope final) installment of his phenomenally successful Spider-Man series is what frustrates me the most about this overlong, CGI-saturated 2007 movie. It feels like he was given free reign to do whatever he wanted without the intrusion of common sense. The result is a megalomaniacal failure leavened by scattered moments of levity. Written by Raimi, along with his brother Ivan and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the story begins promisingly with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, regaling in his celebrity status and mustering up enough courage up to propose to longtime love Mary-Jane Watson, who is incredibly making her Broadway musical debut.<br /><br />The film wastes little time in establishing that Peter's ego has run amok - obviously an ironic parallel to Raimi's situation - and that he will be forced to face a crisis of conscience amid the shenanigans of not one but three villains. Spelling out the motivations of each of these characters takes time, as does the resuscitation of the love triangle between Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn and Peter's guilt over how he responded to his Uncle Ben's murder. Consequently, the movie feels overstuffed by the multiple storylines that only coalesce through pat plot conventions executed toward the end in order for the movie to have an acceptable running time. Moreover, the novelty of the special effects has tangibly worn out since the initial outing, and there is a surprising technical laziness found in some of the action sequences, especially with the overuse of nighttime shots to camouflage some of the battles.<br /><br />A key problem also lies in the divergent yet predictable ways the villains have been developed. The resuscitated Green Goblin represents the result of revenge, while Flint Marko is a petty criminal caught in a radiation field that turns him into Sandman, a burgeoning creature made of sand (probably the film's best CGI sequence). The most skimpily developed villain is Venom, a gloopy, fast-moving black parasite that takes hold of Peter first before it takes control of professional rival Eddie Brock. If this was not enough, the story also introduces another key female character, model Gwen Stacy who happens to be the daughter of the police chief and Mary-Jane's competition for Peter's affections. All these detours serve to bring Peter to his original sensibilities about being Spider-Man and of course, to the big climactic battle. This is perhaps the most disappointing portion of the movie as at least two far-fetched plot points undermine the dramatic tension and seem to emphasize the silliness of the entire venture.<br /><br />In keeping with its comic book origins, Raimi infuses the movie with a sense of humor, but the resulting variability in tone threatens to submerge the movie into camp. The principal actors - Tobey Maguire as Peter, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane and James Franco as Harry - are back but give us little additional depth or texture to their characters. Broadway luminary Rosemary Harris is also back lending sage advice as Aunt May, as are J.K. Simmons as blowhard editor J. Jonah Jameson, Elizabeth Banks as saucy Miss Brant and Dylan Baker as the all-knowing Dr. Connors. Thomas Haden Church plays Marko stoically, while Topher Grace is simply irritating as the obnoxious Brock. Bryce Dallas Howard lends the right vacuity to air-headed Gwen, while Theresa Russell is wasted in a cameo as Marko's defeated wife. This is one dismal blockbuster worth skipping.equence).

B00030590I|3.0|Although I enjoyed this film way better than \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\\" I didn't enjoy it as much as \\"House of the Flying Daggers.\\" I'm not a big fan of the far-fetched fighting sequences. I can go along with them to a point, but I can't not question how someone can fight off thousands of arrows with just the long sleeves of their outfit and not only survive, but without a scratch basically too. All that aside, I enjoyed the multiple versions told of one story. And the imagery was really beautiful at times.

Why? I just wanted my safe paycheck.. yet I nver really forced myself to see where were the opps around me, my eyes were not trained for they were numbed in seeking for somelese.. so I began doing it, what I can create around of what I am looking at that will enable me to have a somey generating system?

0393327655|5.0|Our times have seen the rise of the radical religious agenda, with attempts both here and abroad by fundamentalists to gain undue political power. This combination of religion and politics in the past led to the Inquisition, the crusades, and the Salem witch trials. Our system of laws only gives us protection in as far as reason can triumph over blind faith and intolerance.  Dr Harris presents a cogent analysis of the basis of faith and its shortcomings in our age of advancing science and technology. While the rigidly religious may find this book threatening, anyone who likes to think for themselves will find it a vital resource.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|ElleGoozdich <br />I really enjoyed watching the Great Gatsby, especially after finishing the book first. Reading the book helped me to first picture each character my way and interpret Fitzgerald's writing on my own. Watching the movie, then, showed me a different perspective. I, for instance, had pictured Daisy to be much different than she was depicted in the movie...I had assumed that she was a little more down-to-earth than she was made out to be. However, I thought that Robert Redford played the perfect Gatsby, and Nick and Tom were also just how I'd imagined. <br />The scenery and costumes in the movie were also extremely ornate--I loved all of the detail and the thrill of the 1920's. The party scene was my favorite, where everyone dances in Gatsby's backyard dressed in Flapper outfits with short, perfectly waved hair. <br />I feel that watching the movie did have several advantages, but I did like the book much better, as the book kept me constantly guessing and felt more realistic than seeing it acted out. All in all The Great Gatsby was a good experience and I would recommend the book and movie to anyone--in that order.

B00005JPKE|4.0|Decoration Day or Memorial Day as it is now called is a day set aside to honor those who fought in all of the wars since the Civil War, wars in defense of country and citizens. While we languish over the misbegotten war on Iraq it is helpful to view the Clint Eastwood film LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and visit the mindset of the 'enemy' - the soldiers pointing weapons our way - in an attempt to understand the global effect of war on the battlefield.    Eastwood wisely pairs his disappointing 'Flags of our Fathers', which addressed the political 'war games' simultaneously with the combat on a small Japanese island in World War II, with a 'look at the other side' viewpoint. The same type of militarism, blind faith in the war machine, brutality, fear of dying, bonding among friends, the spectrum of 'good officers versus cruel inflexible officers, and the spectrum of humanity is equalized and the result is a moving drama that sheds needed light on how 'war' is a universal beast no matter one's stance.    The telling of the story with occasional letter contents is sound if somewhat over long. The screenplay by Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis is based on Tadamichi Kuribayashi's \\"Picture Letters from Commander in Chief\\" - Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) being the film's chief character. Watanabe is excellent in his well-rounded approach to the role of the 'good commander' in both his wise military judgment and his kindness bestowed on the simplest of soldiers such as Saigo (the sensitive Kazunari Ninomiya). For many of us this is the first encounter with the vantage that the Japanese were minimally supplied and supported in defending their sacred Iwo Jima against the American aggressors: the battle was a doomed last stand for the Japanese despite all the casualties suffered by both sides. Eastwood does away with the 'kamikaze' stereotype of the Japanese soldier and allows us to see them as human beings, away form home, fighting to defend their country and their honor.    No one is right in war: circumstances and places vary from Europe, the Far East, the Middle East and here but horrors remain the same. It is good to be reminded of this, as in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, especially on Memorial Day. Grady Harp, May 07

B0000AQS0F|2.0|The show is well-written in many respects, but it's largely a mess otherwise. The cast is lame save a few. The sets are totally unimpressive. And the show rips off every sci-fi show and movie I've ever seen.  <br />Also, the spiritual/religious/new-age mumbo jumbo is highly irritating, particularly considering how shallow and derivitative the show is. Sadly, I think this mumbo jumbo may be exactly why it has such a large cult following despite its much-deserved early cancellation.  <br />Worst of all, the mash-up of the sci-fi and western genres is poorly done and adds nothing to the show at all. They can jet around space at will, but no one can be bothered to pave roads or build cars?! WTF?  <br />Don't buy the hype. <br />This show is lame.
0385340559|5.0|Have read all the Jack Reacher books.  This was most exciting. Last time, we caught up with Reacher in Miami; now he turns up in Portland, Heaven knows why.<br /><br />Reacher received a 10-30 from an old Unit buddy and cant resist the challenge.  Each of Lee Child's books holds the most complicated schemes but these are what hold the interest.  Oh yes, I learned the innner workings of a carwash; why not to peek into hotel spyholes; how to break someone's neck with one hand and how to make lots of Molotov cocktails.  Always good to know.  :/<br /><br />Reacher, with the help of Frances Neagley, does not stop until he finds out what happened to each and every one of the rest in his old Unit which numbered 8.  Great and good fun.  The last several chapters always whip start the heart and has you swallowing nervously until the very last page.  Always love what Reacher does to the bad guys. The ending has you shaking your head and saying \\"That's so typical Reacher.\\"<br /><br />Waiting for the next.  BTW, Mr. Childs, I like the UK covers better.  Getting tired of buying all those target covers.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I was disappointed with this new release.  I have been a Major Rush fan from 1974 when I played along my first guitar riffs from Working Man, and have been along for the ride from then on.  But from the moment this CD arrived, the packaging made me wonder what what going on. It is a little closer to earth than was Vapor Trails (which I also did not connect with) but Neil has gone on a different path since his losses - understandable, but still, I can not connect to where his head is. Even the rest of the music is hardly anything to listen to, and the singing is amaturish.  Maybe I am getting too old, or maybe Rush has run out of music.  Maybe I have just moved a different direction.  After 30 years of loving most everthing this treo has done, maybe our paths have diverged.  Sad to think of that.  I loved Geddy's \\"My favorite Headache\\".  That may have been the end of the line for us.  I will likely continue to buy anything new they produce out of sheer loyalty to what we ahve been through the last 30 years.  Even If I don't listen to it more than a few times. <br />\\"Give me back my wonder\\" Have you nothing more to give?  At least Rush has stayed true to themseves, and start thinking they are more than just normal people, struggling with life and not done a John Denver on us pushing their environmentalist cause or urging us to put our money where their mouth is.  That is extremly rare in this commercial age.  I am glad they never sold out, and hoped they would never burn out.  It's been a good long ride my friends.  Perhaps we shall meet on some distant shore again and share life again. <br />
0307341542|3.0|This book got so many good reviews...I wonder if I even read the same book. It is so boring, slow it took way too many days for me to finish it.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|I've been meaning to watch this and I finally did this past weekend.  Gore does an amazing job in his presentation conveying his message about what is happening and what we must do to stop this.  He presents this more like a \\"friend to friend\\" format than in a politician's crafted jargon.  It is definitely a must watch.    The reason I am giving this 4 stars, however, is that as Gore mentions how we must reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the movie shows him at one point riding in a motorcade on his way to deliver his presentation and at another point him driving a Cadillac on his Tenessee farm.  Obviously these aren't two ways to do what he emphasizes, even though the motorcade was for security reasons.  While I have read elsewhere that Gore does primarily drive a hybrid vehicle, I was somewhat bothered that the movie shows him doing otherwise.  But this is by no means a bash on Al Gore...it's more a bash on the movie direction.
B0000AUHQT|2.0|This adaptation does not do the novel justice. F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is better left to the imagination. My opinion is not based on the quality of the actors (which was poor in some cases but not all). Rather, I am of the opinion that this movie, instead of focusing on the theme of The Great Gatsby, made the movie more of a soap opera starring Daisy and Gatsby and Tom. This may not be a fault peculiar to this particular film; I doubt that any director could adequately support Fitzgerald's theme. It cannot be conveyed on a film reel. <br />The movie also made the idea of Gatsby's and Daisy's reunion seem too contrived, a problem which Fitzgerald managed to avoid.  <br />In short, the actual novel is a better choice than its film adaptation. If you must watch it, read the book first. At the very least do not substitute the movie for the book.
0765316978|5.0|With The Last Colony John Scalzi brings his loose Old Man's War trilogy to a close. This is the story of John Perry and Jane Sagan hoping to do nothing more than continue their lives on the colonial planet of Huckleberry. They have a good quiet life together. Perry is the ombudsman of Huckleberry his wife, Sagan, is the town constable. They have an adopted daughter, Zoe, and two aliens which hold Zoe in great reverence because of who her birth father was. This idyllic life is perfect for John Perry and Jane Sagan, but it would make a fairly crappy science fiction novel.<br /><br />A representative from the Colonial Union pays a visit to Perry and Sagan to request that they lead a new colony, this one the new colony of Roanoke. Unfortunately for Roanoke, there is a four hundred and twelve member collection of alien races called the Conclave. The Conclave has ordered that there will be no more colonies on any planet unless specified by the Conclave, and then only by Conclave member nations. If the Conclave can find Roanoke, the fledgling colony may be destroyed. With conflict within the colony as it struggles to survive, political maneuvering from the Colonial Union about the future of Roanoke, and the threat of alien destruction, there is quite a bit going on behind the scenes and the very future of humanity is at stake.<br /><br />There is a very real question on whether or not any human colony would ever be named Roanoke. The lost colony which existed for three years in 1500's Virginia before disappearing utterly. While a government would not necessarily be superstitious, there would be no reason to name a colony after a failed colony, so right from the start Scalzi is telling his readers something about what is going on: it isn't what we first know, and that Scalzi's Roanoke faces the same danger of disappearing as the original Roanoke did.<br /><br />Rather than an action filled story, like Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, The Last Colony is a novel about survival. There is far less action, but still The Last Colony tells a good story about the threats to Roanoke and how Perry and Sagan respond to those threats.<br /><br />Perhaps the largest trademark of a Scalzi novel is the wise cracking sense of humor each novel is laced with. The bottom line is that a Scalzi novel is fun to read. Pure pleasure. Scalzi novels read quickly with a sense of joy in the storytelling. Even being more of a political novel than the military action of the previous two OMW stories, The Last Colony is chock full of fast paced storytelling and with this volume, the story is closed on John Perry and Jane Sagan. The fan in me wishes that Scalzi would write more OMW stories, but the realist says that this chapter is closed and that the stories have been told. Scalzi leaves his readers wanting more, and that's a major mark in the favor of Scalzi. Scalzi is a talented storyteller and worth spending the time to read.<br /><br />- Joe Sherryout survival.

0385340559|5.0|BL&T is different from previous Jack Reacher novels in that Jack does not work alone.  He teams up with some old army buddies to investigate the murder of one of their own.  Needless to say, he doles out some serious arm-twisting and other punishment in solving the mystery.  As usual, plenty of black coffee is consumed and justice is eventually dished out to the bad guys in a satisfying ending.  Along the way, Lee Child keeps the tension going while the plot is unraveled for the reader.  The good thing about the Jack Reacher series is that there is not a disappointment in the bunch.  This series and the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series of Robert Crais are my two favorite thrillers.
0425152251|5.0|This is a book to teach young adults about philosophy and ideas that have influenced the world. 15 year old Sophie starts to receive messages that ask her to think about who she is and where the world comes from. Then Alberto Knox sends her lessons about philosophers' attempts to ask and answer philosophical questions. The lessons cover highlights of 2000 years of philosophical thought. She also begins to receive some postcards from a UN observer in Lebanon. The philosophy lessons are made interesting by the story of Sophie trying to figure out why she is receiving the lessons and the postcards. This book is not only a great introduction to philosophy for young adults but would be a fascinating read for everyone who heard about different philosophers' ideas throughout their lives but never really got around to reading about philosophy.
B000002H5I|4.0|Chapman's mellow voice always has the ability to make me disappear somewhere else. My favorite track on the CD is Fast Car. The ballad about running away from life, and a drinking father with the one you love. The music is superb, and brilliant. Her soft voice, and mellow sound make you melt, and want to run away too.  <br />The somber sound in her voice is uncaptured by almost anyone else. Her music is very important, stoic, and meaningful.  <br />If you like laid back music with some feeling behind it- that you could lay in bed and listen to by candlelight- then this might be the CD for you.
B00006BTCA|5.0|For the longest time I kept telling myself I really oughta write a nice review for Interpol on Amazon, and tonight's the night. This is my ode to TURN ON THE BRIGHT LIGHTS by the amazing New York band Interpol. I had bought the CD the year it came out and decided to take it with me on a road trip from LA to Vegas. I should say I absolutely dread driving to Vegas, most Angelenos do. What is supposed to be a 3-hour trip usually turns out to be a 5-hour bumper to bumper nightmare and the road leading to Sin City is not exactly scenic, with nothin' but desert and all, I mean, how many cactus can one admire in an endless open field of cactuses? But I sensed this trip was different, and I knew the instant I heard the opening track to this flawless debut of an album.<br /><br />What's more, with each song I grew increasingly interested in the music and slowly drifted from my environment, finding myself enjoying the ride. The road rage that I had started slipping away with each passing of familiar street signs. Imagine a perfect harmony of landscape blended with poetry for my ears. Surely this can't be one of the rare albums that I can listen to throughout its entirety, I pondered, and anticipated. In the end I wasn't let down. With each repeated listen (that's the trick I think, one would have to give this multiple consecutive hearings in order to fully appreciate it), I realized I started developing feelings for the album.<br /><br />Feelings?<br /><br />Ah, but let me tell you why.<br /><br />Each song tells a story, and when I'm told a story, I want it to be as intoxicating, as dreamy and as atmospheric as each song is on this album. It evokes a mood that's long lost along with childhood, the mood of being afloat, being weightless, being innocent with a sense of discovery. As soon as you hear the opening words, you'll know you're being transferred to a place where you wish time stood still. It's mesmerizing, this album, to say the least. And it is dark, and ambient, and very moody, in all good sense of the words. It is music that evokes the very feelings in me, the longing, the fears, the hopes and the dreams. Whenever I'm in a bad mood or have had a tough day, I play this album and instantly feel better. It has over the years become my best friend, my confidant, my haven, a way to relax and enjoy this thing called life. This album is excellent throughout and that's how one should listen to it, in its entirety, but like anybody else I have my own personal favorites:<br /><br />The beautifully lush opener \\"Untitled\\" really paints a picture for the rest of the album. This song makes me want to renew old friendships with long neglected school chums, \\"I will surprise you sometime, I'll come round..\\" It reminds me of the carefree, more fearless days of my youth.<br /><br />\\"Obstacle 1\\" and \\"PDA\\" were singles I had heard on the radio that propelled me to buy the album. Both are fast with great guitar and drums. I thought if the rest of the songs sound like the two, it'd be money well spent. Turns out I got every pennies' worth and then some. This record really was the best 13-dollar investment I've ever made.<br /><br />An early favorite is \\"Hands Away.\\" This is perhaps the most melodic, most hypnotic song on the album. I was cast under its spell upon hearing the beginning riffs. \\"Will you put my hands away, will you be my man?...\\" This song is kinda like \\"Untitled\\" in that there are only a handful of lyrics to both the songs but the impact they'll hit you with is immeasurable.<br /><br />My absolute favorite song in the Interpol catalogue is the wonderfully sexually blatant, yet tender and romantic 7-minute opus called \\"Stella Was a Diver and She's Always Down.\\" It's flawless, this song. There is not a part in this epic song that I don't like. From the music to the lyrics, it's like a dream, and a nice way of spending seven minutes of one's day, loving \\"Stella\\" the way Paul Banks does:<br /><br />\\"when she walks down the street, she knows there's people watching<br /><br /> building fronts are just fronts, to hide the people watching her<br /><br /> she once fell through the street, down the man hole in that bad way<br /><br /> the underground drip, was just like her scuba days...\\"<br /><br />The last song on the album is called \\"Leif Erikson\\" and I find out he's one of the first European settlers to set foot in the States. I don't know what that has to do with the song really, cos to me this song conjures up all kinds of notions and ideals of romance. From Paul's voice and the lyrics to the dreamy surreal atmosphere of the drums and guitars, this the most mesmerizing song of all:<br /><br />\\"she says it helps with the lights out<br /><br /> her rabid glow is like braille to the night<br /><br /> she feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids gloves<br /><br /> she doesn't know that I left my urge in the ice box<br /><br /> she swears I'm just prey for the female<br /><br /> well then hook me up and pull me babycakes<br /><br /> cause I like to get hooked<br /><br /> the clock is set for nine but you know you're gonna make it eight<br /><br /> so that you can take some time and teach each other to reciprocate...\\"<br /><br />If you're still reading this then tonight's the night. Get romanced by a lil' Interpol and who knows, maybe you'll start harboring feelings too.<br /><br />Afterall, they're nothing more than feelings.down the street, she knows there's people watching <br /> building fronts are just fronts, to hide the people watching her <br /> she once fell through the street, down the man hole in that bad way <br /> the underground drip, was just like her scuba days...\\" <br /> <br />The last song on the album is called \\"Leif Erikson\\" and I find out he's one of the first European settlers to set foot in the States.

B000059TEQ|5.0|I imagine that the movie must make Erich Segal proud as it's very true to the novel and captures the characters perfectly. As I read, and re-read love story the faces of McGraw and O'Neal are in my minds. The movie is tragic, and beautiful all at once, just like the book, and is in the same tone and timing as the book. If you loved the novel, the movie will not disappoint you.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a very well presented and excellent documentary by Al Gore on the effects of Global Warming.  He provides his viewers with a powerful factual message-the documentary is very well done and is used in many high school classrooms to enable students to become aware that their actions could and likely are contributing to this devastating problem that is currently occurring in our world. This DVD alerts citizens that we do need to do our part to preserve our country and world on a more individual basis.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Mermaid was one of Disney's last great movies.....before they started trying to spin each classic tale into a 2nd, 3rd movie....each meaningless money making machines.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid is the Disney version of the Hans Christian Anderson tale. Disney brings it to life with the beautiful Ariel, and a whole cast of loveable characters- Flounder, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, Skuttle.<br /><br />Ariel, the youngest of many daughters is bored with life under water and want to explore life on land as a human. She see's a man aboard a boat and falls in love. His name is Eric. When a storm rages, Ariel saves Eric and leaves his ashore. He sees her and can't forget her face. Against her fathers wishes Ariel dreams of life on land. She bargains with the sea witch Ursula to turn her into a human. The price she pays is her voice. She has to make Eric fall in love with her- but she has no voice.<br /><br />Ursula uses Ariels voice to bring her father to her knees. In the end, she is overcome, and Triton- Ariels father is saved, and let's Ariel go- to become a human.<br /><br />The music is some of the most creative animated music EVER. From Kiss the girl to Under the Sea, each songs is singable, and unforgettable. Boy and girls alike will love this movie about dreams, courage, and adventure.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|So cool and so sad to see a movie that really has a heart but that most people will never know about because they're wasting time in the theatres with sequel #12.  This movie did the impossible.  Be a love story about musicians and have really great original music that they composed.
B00004S8K9|5.0|This is the original version of the film that was remade with Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah, which, to be honest with you, I haven't seen (I may never, actually). It's also the first in what became a franchise--there's actually a *fourth* film in the series, which came out earlier this year.<br /><br />But it's hard to top the sheer velocity of this film, from the opening credits and the riff of \\"Misirlou\\" by Dick Dale, shamelessly stolen from \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" to the climactic chase through the streets of Paris. There's plenty of humor, a little bit of sexiness (Marion Cotillard has to be one of the most beautiful women alive today, and then they throw in Emma Sj&ouml;berg just for good measure), and everything's wrapped up in just about an hour and a half. Seriously, this is totally worth owning a region-free DVD player for.<br /><br />This first film also pits French automotive ingenuity against the Germans; the second takes on the Japanese. The less said about the third (with a Sylvester Stallone cameo, no less), the better, and I haven't seen the fourth one yet, but even if it's only as good as the third, it will still be leagues better than most American action films being made today.<br /><br />Luc Besson is the brains behind this, and he's the reason I ended up watching this--L&eacute;on: The Professional is in my top five favorite films of all time. So try to watch this by hook or by crook, but definitely enjoy yourself!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I bought this movie because I read the book Differnt Seasons (by Stephen King) that has this story in it. The book was great and so was the movie. The plot is the same but the story is a little differnt in the movie. This is one of the few movies as good as the book. My only complaint is that the movie would mot play on Windows Media Player on my computer, instead I had to install InterActual Player. I personaly did not see the point of that.
B00005JMJG|5.0|If you've ever wanted to forget something painful or wanted to never forget something precious...this movie will strike a cord in you.   <br /> <br />I was watching this movie for pure entertainment, I admit.  I was killing time.  I knew it was different.  I had no real expectations going into it.  But the story line is compelling and thought provoking.  And suddenly entertainment becomes so much more.   <br /> <br />I wish more movies were this way.  I love an open ended story that allows the audience to bring themselves into it.  And forget the fluff and cookie cutter approach to traditional romances today.  This movie brings in the reality of relationships and all the pain and insecurity that can come with them.  It's an honest look at people.  Jim & Kate's relationship isn't what I would call exemplary or a good model, but I still totally got into their connection with each other. <br /> <br />Yes, I really enjoyed this movie.  In an age where time is precious, watching this movie is a very good use of it.  Use your grey matter, people!  Watch this movie and THINK! <br />
0316018953|3.0|Just finished it minutes ago. I didn't enjoy as much as Connelly's others of the series. It satisfied my HB fix I needed since I read Echo Park but I missed the in-depth characterization that I have come to love and expect. All in all a good read, just wish i could have waited for it in paperback.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I like this CD a lot. It's very Avril with lots of angst, and hurt. Lots of ballads, a lot of songs you can sing a long to.  <br />Fall to Pieces is a favorite of mine on this CD, and upbeat song. It also includes \\" My happy ending\\" with a different beginning- a different sound. I am not sure the album shows much growth from her last album but it was good too, and Avril is in pretty uncharted waters here anyways....as most of her counterparts are less rock, and more bubble gum. It's a CD you can listen to more than once over and find a new one you like. There are a few songs on here that are a little weak....but otherwise it's a good cd.
B000002KIK|4.0|I love reading reviews of this album. Either it was the worst album or one of the best depending on what aspects of Sabbath one most admires. They had moved far far away from the detuned sludge doom of the classic early albums. But in in 1978 no one wanted to hear gloom and doom. Sabbath took a risk and tried mixing many different influences; more emphasis on songs than riffs, some keyboards and a little jazz fusion. The production is a bit boxy and thin in places, especially guitar and drums. But I think it is nevertheless a brilliant album, and \\"Johnny Blade', \\"Junior's Eyes\\" and \\"Shockwave\\" are among their best. Fans of metal, bless em, are typically not the most musically adventurous and you put in some jazz influence and non-riff oriented songs and they flip the f#% out. The musicians in Sabbath all played jazz and nothing is more Sabbath than throwing some in. And Bill Ward's vocal on \\"Swinging The Chain\\" is fantastic. I love this record. It is not typical Sabbath and was not intended to be. No other record before or since has ever sounded quite like it and for that it will always have a special place for me. I found it far more interesting than \\"Techinical Ecstacy\\".
0553381342|4.0|Tom Wolfe understands human nature.  He skewers just about every character in this scathing satire, revealing their hidden motives vis a vis their outward actions.  Pride seems to be at the root of everyone's shameful conduct in this novel.  Tempted to forget about fallen human nature?  You'll remember after reading this one; I recognzied my own sordid manipulations and rationalizations in Wolfe's well-crafted characters.  The book's not preachy, though, and it's funny; I laughed out loud a number of times.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|If you are a fan of John Lennon mixed with Badly Drawn Boy, this is perfection.  My fiance and i put it on for the first time the other day while cleaning the house and i kept stopping to just go \\"wow\\" to a certain chord or progression taht i wasn't expecting.  Awesome stuff
B000O75F7C|4.0|This album was my introduction to Porcupine Tree. Their music is some of the best I've heard in a long time, but I am not a fan of their lyrics.  The lyrics are generally written from a first person perspective of someone they're trying to criticize.  I think that putting oneself in another's shoes in order to criticize that other person (culture, really) is in poor taste.  The lyrics often remind me of an older generation complaining, \\"kids these days...\\"  Having said that, they do have a few lyrical gems mixed in.   <br /> <br />The music, on the other hand, is simply wonderful.  From haunting to rocking, it is original, complex and beautiful to listen to.  It's everything the other reviews say it is.  I'd rather hear a song written from the perspective of the songwriter than a made up perspective, but I'm very happy to hear music this terrific anyway I can get it.
B000LC55F2|4.0|It's only once in a while these days, that a mainstream movie comes along that tells a defiantly original story - and rarer still that it turns out to be intelligently told too.  This movie manages both. <br />It's a movie about obsession - entirely fitting that it should be directed by Christopher Nolan, known for his exactitude. This obsession that two illusionists have for their craft and finding the ultimate illusion, leads from one twist to another as the story unravels, or more accurately unpeels layer by layer.  As the story progresses, we find ever greater depths to which the protagonists are willing to go to perfect their act.   <br />The cast are uniformly excellent - it seems Christian Bale is becoming somewhat of an on screen alter ego for Nolan.  And co-stars Scarlett Johanssen and Michael Caine acquit themselves well, the latter especially adding gravitas to proceedings. <br />On the technical side, the dialogue is often at low mumbling levels for key comments or interchanges, and while striking, the photography by Nolan's Batman Begins lenser Wally Pfister is on the gloomy side.  These quibbles are more than made up for by a fantastic cast and inventive storytelling.  If you know nothing of the story, then so much the better.  Be warned, however - there is a direction the plot goes in which verges more on science-fiction, and this may jar with some audiences who are at that point involved with the mystery and period detail. <br />Other than that, a fine period mystery with superior acting and art direction. <br />
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Nancy Myers is quickly proving that she is the end all when it comes to witty, smart, dramedy! And Hans Zimmer's perfect score make this film untoppable! <br />The concept of the film is switching houses, think the book Tara Road.  <br />Kate Winslet is the victim of unrequited love, and is fleeing on vacation to escape Jasper. Amanda played by Diaz, a work-aholic, incapabale of crying, flees L.A. to England to stay in a cottage owned by Winslets character. There she meets Jude Law's character and is swept away unexpectedly, only to find he's not as he seems. Winslet's character meets interesting people and helps them overcome some struggles only to also unexpectedly find love, and justice for herself, and freedom from Jasper. But not without taking two steps back first.  <br />The music is some of the best ever in a film of this kind! Zimmer's music makes you feel the emotions. It's smart, funny, witty, will make you laugh and even cry. It has the feel of an old Hollywood love-story, feel good happy ending. It's instantly a classic!
B00000IMTH|4.0|What an odd album to put out at the height of disco and punk and the dawn of New Wave; a classic hard rock album with Camelot-like themes. The title track frankly has not aged well but was probably one of the more timely tracks, as it has a sort of boogie arena rock feel to it. The rest the album though has many great moments, continuing on in the mode set by \\"Rising\\"; solid hard rock that sits somewhere between \\"Who Do We Think We Are\\" Deep Purple and \\"Physical Graffitti\\" Led Zeppelin, but with medieval themes. Wildly unfashionable at the time I am sure. But that makes it that much more endearing, as perhaps it was ahead of the game, foreshadowing the NWONHM wave that came only a year or two after. Fans of Dio , Purple and Rainbow must have this record. On it's own merits it is really a great album. \\"Kill The King\\" abosolutely rocks. And I always thought Blackmore was brave to use such a relatively clean tone playing the riffs he did. I think you have to be a guitar player to appreciate the less saturated metal tones that sound so powerful but ultimately generic. This record has  class and some truly memorable songs.
B000002UB3|5.0|How can one properly rate and review the best album from the best group ever?  It seems as if 5 stars simply does not do this maserpiece justice.  The greatness of this album is all the more impressive in that it features one of my least favorite songs [Octopus's Garden].  This album features some of the finest songs ever, but couple with eachother and following in a seamless sequence, they are the most impressive grouping of songs ever assembled.  My personal favorites are:<br /><br />Oh! Darling - A very nice little rocker, with much soul.<br /><br />Because - A great emotion filled song.<br /><br />And of course the finest sequence of songs, which I believe are the glue for this album:<br /><br />She Came in Through the Bathroom Window<br /><br />Golden Slumbers<br /><br />Carry That Weight<br /><br />Simply perfect!!!!  The best from the Best!
1594489505|5.0|This second book from Khaled Hosseini \\"Splendid Suns\\" Proves \\"The Kite Runner\\" was no fluke or just plain good luck.  This man is a passionate writer. This is another story that has profoundly touched my life and makes me want to do something, anything that can make places like this in today's world better.  This story will have you soul searching, and it stays with you .  I am still thinking of it days later,  and I am disappointed I don't have anymore of it to read. Writing is his calling,  and I hope he has many more stories to tell. Thank you for another book on life, love, loss, and triumph. :)
B00005JMEW|5.0|I've been waiting for the Director's Cut to be released so that I can see both films the way Tarantino originally imagined them....as  ONE film!....Does anyone know if this is in the works??
B000P7V45S|5.0|I was really amazed and happy to find Mr. Bill Bruford himself (from Yes and King Crimson) playing the drums on the DVD. On Second's Out live cd he plays only on Cinema Show and on other songs it's Chester Thompson. That film must be from the very early live performances of the 4 men Genesis. Also I liked Steve Hackett whom you don't see very often on DVD with Collins, Banks and Rutherford. Brings back good memories from 30+ years.
6305949980|5.0|Burton's dark love story will still take your breath away. The Nightmare before Christmas has a cult following, and it's no suprise why. The story is a most incredible, and creative story, with great music.  <br />Kids will love it, but adults even more. I think this movie is 100 years before it's time. It's something you could only expect from Burton and it will still leave you enamored.
0385486804|4.0|This is worth the read if you are into the outdoors and/or like true stories.  The first half of the book traces events leading up to Chris'(AKA Alex)travels prior to his fateful trip through the Alaskan wilderness. You can see that Alex was challenging fate many times by making many mistakes along the way.  Was it youth, was it a death-wish?  I think he just thought what alot of people think... that bad things happen to other people, but it's not going to happen to me.  If you read this book and then read Deep Survial (I read them in reverse) then you will see how misfortunes like Alex's occur.  <br /> <br />If you are into the outdoors and participate in extreme sports, I also suggest you also try Deep Survival by Laurence Gonzales.  Touching the Void is also good (I only saw the DVD though and have not read the book it was based on).
B000002J09|5.0|Much has been said about this tremendous rock album.  It is in the top 10 of any rock collection.  For any group other than Led Zeppelin, this would be their masterpiece.  For Led Zeppelin, this is another excellent showcase of the rock and roll prowess, but it is not even their best album.  I personnally give that honor to Houses of the Holy, but that does not take away from this 5 star outstanding work!
1400032717|5.0|This book is highly insightful, and will appeal to all who enjoy a good think.
0142000655|5.0|This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone. <br />
B00000ADG2|5.0|By now we all know how ground breaking this CD was. Almost 10 years later it's still ahead of it's time. Hill paved the way other singers, and other sounds. From the slow sad songs, to the upbeat I am woman hear me roar lyrics, Hill lays it down.
1594489505|5.0|When I first read Khaled Hosseini's first book, it made me think about it for a long time.  It became the best book I had ever read. That was until I finished this book.  Now I don't know which is better.  I recommend this book to everyone, no matter what genre of books you prefer.  It really makes you appreciate life and motivates you to make a difference in any way you can.  Hopefully this book will do as well as The Kite Runner.  I am looking forward to the movies these books will turn into.
B000001FS6|4.0|For a U2 album, this is alright.  For any other group it would be tremendous.  I think this is a 3 star album if not for the fantastic remake of Helter Skelter.  In true dramatic fashion, Bono states that \\"this is a song that Charles Manson stole from the Beatles, we're stealing it back\\" and then the great cover of a lost classic begins.  Some wonderful songs on this U2 offering, some not so good.  Still a worthy part of any music collection.
B000P0J02E|3.0|Even if I knew nothing about the Pirates franchise's soundtracks, it was obvious to me within about 30 minutes of sitting down to see the film this weekend that Hans Zimmer was the composer.  I don't know if that is a good thing or not - I suppose it depends not only on what you think of Zimmer's work but what you expect from movie soundtrack composition itself.  The music works very well with this movie.  There were times when I was really quite entertained by the sound work in this film - unlike more \\"serious\\" adventure movie soundtracks Zimmer has done in the past, this one has moments of comedy, as when Jack interacts with himself; but at other times it is the same Zimmer cliches, as in the scenes that correspond to the tracks titled \\"Up is Down\\" and \\"Drink Up Me Hearties\\".  But, as is often typical of Zimmer soundtracks, there were times when I found the recycling from other movies quite distracting.  In fact, by the time the movie had ended and I was walking out of the theater, the accompanying music was almost identical to Zimmer's battle scene music in Gladiator.  I am ambivalent in the end - there is enough originality at times in this soundtrack to delite, but it is a mixed bag full of Zimmer cliches used over and over again in movie after movie as well.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|I thought that the movie was a good movie for the Great Gatsby. Its vivid pictures and scenes displayed the time period of the book very well. I really got a better understanding of what the parties of Gatsby were like and what kind of character he and the rest of the crew were. I did not like though how they left out some of the parts of the books, which were helpful to understand the whole movie. The actors all played their part very well and all exemplified their character, making it come to live just how i imagined it. The movie was really fun to watch and easy to follow. It is definaltey a movie that everyone should watch.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This CD is awesome. If you love Phil, you'll love this. All the slow sad hits, to the upbeat fun ones...what can I say? What's not to love?
B00008G9JO|4.0|I am of the opinion that Jethro Tull produced some fine music during the 1977-1978 timeframe and this 1978 album, although moving away from the full blown prog of the early-mid 1970s, still packs a proggy punch.  Without naming names, it is worth mentioning that this album is much, much better than albums being released by their English prog \\"colleagues\\" in 1978.  When paired with the excellent Songs from the Wood (1977), these two albums present an excellent fusion of progressive rock and the woodsier flavors of the folk music.  A very nice combination in fact - come to think of it, this phase of Jethro Tull is a personal favorite.<br /><br />The lineup on Heavy Horses included Ian Anderson (vocals; flute; mandolin; acosutic guitar; and whistles); the amazing Barriemore Barlow (drums and percussion); my favorite Tull bassist (John Glascock); Martin Barre (electric and acoustic guitars); John Evans (piano; organ; synthesizers); and David Palmer (portative pipe organ; synthesizers; orchestral arrangements).  Joining the band was ex-Curved Air member Darryl Way who contributed some violin on the title track.  The playing by all members is just fantastic, with Barriemore and John Glascock forming a formidable rhythm section.  Barriemore's playing on this album is especially impressive.<br /><br />The nine tracks on the album range in length from 3'11\\" to 8'57\\" and present a superb blend of progressive rock, hard rock, and some folk-inflected rock.  Fortunately, I do not hear any attempts to incorporate any mainstream musical styles popular at the time, e.g. disco, American arena rock.  In fact, this is a very organic sounding album through and through, and pleasant acoustic textures balance the more rocking aspects of their music out nicely.  One of my favorite tracks on this album is No Lullaby - the drum fills are breathtaking - Barriemore really pulls out the stops.<br /><br />This remastered album sounds excellent and features liner notes and the lyrics to each of the original tracks.  The bonus tracks are very good too although I was more than pleased with the original album.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent album of acoustic-tinged progressive rock by the band and more or less forms a bookend to their progressive works of the 1970's.  Highly recommended along with Thick as a Brick (1972); A Passion Play (1973); and Songs from the Wood (1977).e bonus tracks are very good too although I was more than pleased with the original album.

B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin really showcase their versatility on this fantastic album/CD.  Look/listen no further than the back to back tracks of D'yer Mak'er & No Quarter to realize how mush this super group had to offer.  Still great after repeated listenings.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Weekly, I watched \\"Planet Earth\\" on the Discovery Channel narrated by Sigorny Weaver.  When I purchased the BBC copy narrated by David Attenborough, I was concerned that it might not be the same visuals as the one shown on Discovery Channel in the USA.  I was pleasantly relieved that the visuals were the same.<br /><br />Mr. Attenborough has a wonderful voice and did a supurb job with the narration.  It will be a treasured part of my DVD library for years to come.<br /><br />Anyone who states television is a vast wasteland has no idea what wonderful material is shown on TV.  We enjoyed the series very much and would hope more shows of this caliber will be shown in the future.
B000MTFDCO|3.0|I gave this flick a 7 out of 10 over at IMDB, but I would give it a 1 out of 10 for it's HD transfer. The movie in HD looks absolutely dull. Save yourself a few bucks and buy the standard DVD title. You'll end up with the same video quality.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|About a boy is a nice, and touching movie. There is some great comedy too. I am a huge Grant fan so it's would almost be impossible for me not to like something he's in. He's so endearing.  <br />However, I guess I am not a Collette fan because I almost never like anything she's in. I don't really get her comedy, and find her odd and misaplaced in most films. Her character her makes me somewhat uncomfortable for some reason. Mostly, the movie just moves rather slow.  <br />It's still a feel-good film and I am glad I saw it. Just wouldn't buy it.
0385340559|5.0|As with all the Reacher books, I was enthralled immediately.  It is rare for an author or a series to be so consistently EXCELLENT.  Reacher working with a team was fascinating; I was rooting for everyone to come out okay, but alas....had to be happy that Reacher did. The plot is electric as always and the story flies.  The characters have more depth than most in this genre and Jack Reacher is at his best.
B000002UAC|4.0|This is a four star album in that is does not come close to the classics that would follow in the Beatles catalogue.  This was one of my first exposures to the Beatles and there really are some wonderful songs on this album.  All My Loving is worth the cost of the CD alone.  Enjoy.
0385733577|5.0|What a great read--I couldn't put it down.  As soon as I'd finished my step-son began.  Mr. Scott's imagination is boundless.

When will a sequel be available?

I shared my feelings with ladies in my church and we have since started a class around this book (we have 28 women all reading it at the same time and \\"flying\\" together).  We all can use this book, whether you have kids or no kids, work outside the home or work as a stay at home mom!  We all have homes, these homes all get dirty, clothes get dirty, meals have to be prepared, and we sometimes want to pull our hair out trying to figure out how to DO IT ALL!

1881273156|5.0|This easy to read and understand book is excellent for OLDY and NEWLY Weds!!  I give it to every couple I do a wedding for.  It helps people understand the needs of their partner and helps them learn new LOVE LANGUAGES!!!  It also helps us understand our own needs and how to be open to other languages.
B00006AG5N|5.0|What an incredible collection of music.  I may even be in the minority, but I thought many of the songs on the Second to None CD were just as good, and in some case better, than many of the offerings here.  To put both together provides some of the greatest sounding songs ever released.  Elvis was more than just a singer and performer.  He is truly an American Icon.  His voice and music are timeless and the grea thing about this CD, is that it opened the door for a lot of listeners who may not have been familiar with the great songs that are classics now and will remain so.  I think it may be about time for \\"Third Times a Charm\\" for those other gems that fell a little short of the other classics.
0316018953|4.0|The Overlook is thriller.  LAPD Homicide Special detective Harry Bosch is brought to the scene of an execution-style murder.  The threat of a terrorist link brings in additional federal and LAPD anti-terrorism units.  As far as Bosch is concerned, however, they are getting in the way of his murder investigation.  He works with what he has, and uncovers deeper mysteries.<br /><br />This novel will keep you turning each page with anticipation.  The pace is fast, the tension realistic, and the concerns are right off today's front page news.  My biggest complaint (without giving away the whodunit) was the \\"finger pointing\\" of Connelly that led to an earlier-than-hoped-for idea of who was really responsible.  This kept me from saying that the author hit a \\"home run\\".  Even with this, Connelly kept the motive a mystery to the end.<br /><br />I'd love to read some reviews written by members of the LAPD.  What do you folk think about how the LAPD was portrayed?  Connelly's characterization of the LAPD's Anti-Terrorism Unit was less than attractive, and probably unfair.<br /><br />I suspect I'll see this book at the beach many times this summer.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I saw a few episodes of this show on the Discovery Channel before deciding that I had to buy it as my very first Blu-ray purchase.

B00005JPO7|4.0|The Academy Award winning German film, \\"The Lives of Others,\\" is a gripping look at the repressive and corrupt regime of the German Democratic Republic in the year 1984 (shades of Orwell). The East German government, with the help of the Stasi, their Ministry for State Security, uses intimidation and a network of spies and informers to keep their citizens in line. A subversive could be incarcerated without trial, tortured, or at the very least, prevented from ever working again in his chosen profession.<br /><br />Georg Dreyman, played by the ruggedly handsome Sebastian Koch, is a talented writer who has thus far avoided a direct confrontation with the East German regime. He garners the Stasi's close attention when he openly complains about the blacklisting of his friend, director Albert Jerska, who has fallen into a deep depression. The authorities insert listening devices in Georg's apartment, and his conversations are monitored by Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, portrayed by Ulrich Muhe with chilling detachment. Even Georg's intimate moments with his sensual girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, are recorded.<br /><br />As Wiesler continues his surveillance, he undergoes a gradual transformation. He cannot help but contrast his sterile and isolated existence with the three-dimensional lives of Georg and his idealistic colleagues and friends. Wiesler decides to alter the contents of the conversations he overhears, substituting benign words for incriminating exchanges. Meanwhile, Dreyman is experiencing his own crisis of conscience. He has the opportunity to publish an article challenging the soundness of the East German regime, but if he is found out, he risks imprisonment and torture.<br /><br />Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck directs with consummate skill, and cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski's angular camera shots and dark palette convey claustrophobia and an atmosphere of impending doom. The performances are uniformly superb. Koch's Dreyman is a man of compassion whose desire for justice is tempered by his fear of reprisals; he is soon caught up in a tangled web that may yet strangle him. Martina Gedeck captures Christa-Maria's intense desperation. Although she adores Georg, she is forced to commit distasteful acts in order to stay on the good side of the powerful and malevolent Minister Bruno Hempf, who has fallen in love with her.  Ulrich Muhe, as Gerd Wiesler, speaks in a monotone, whether he is teaching a class of future policemen about the best techniques for eliciting information from a suspect, or engaging in a joyless tryst with a no-nonsense prostitute. Wiesler's stoicism is belied by expressive eyes that betray his emotional torment, inner pain, and deep need for some human connection.<br /><br />The film's central flaw is its tendency to preach; its themes are hammered home repeatedly, with barely a trace of subtlety. Still, \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a powerful film that will leave viewers shaken as they imagine what it would be like to live in a state of constant dread. Although democracy may be messy and imperfect, its chaos is infinitely preferable to the deadening fist of totalitarianism.ce is tempered by his fear of reprisals; he is soon caught up in a tangled web that may yet strangle him.

B000P2A256|5.0|Whenever you listen to a new cd, particularly one where you're not that familiar with the artist, there's a slight nervousness that you just wasted your money and friends say you \\"didn't get it\\". Maroon 5 sounds like a band everyone can enjoy, right? Pop hooks, rock beats, universal-yet-honest lyrics yet like many bands, you either love it instantly, love it eventually or you never will. Surprising that their new cd caught my attention literally on the first listen. Normally that means I get sick of it but it's rare to find a cd where every song is a winner. <br /> <br />If I Never See Your Face Again: Very groove-based track like many songs on the record, it sets the stage for what you're going to hear: catchy, rocking and accessible. Verses are a bit slow which help make the chorus stand out more. 8/10 <br /> <br />Makes Me Wonder: First single and chosen for good reason. Very funky guitar riff, a catchy-as-hell buzzy bass riff and very sexual lyrics. While it feels slightly repetitive, there's no better song to introduce the record. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Little of Your Time: One of 4 songs that didn't instantly catch me. There's nothing wrong with it really, since it's got a great beat lead by acoustic guitars, wordy verses and odd production flourishes, including what I thought sounded like a Hey Ya! keyboard riff. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Wake Up Call: I love singing this. Lyrics about a cheating girlfriend and getting some revenge, I believe it's the 2nd single as well. It's obviously one of the highlights although I'm worried you might get sick of it. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Won't Go Home Without You: Forget about the fact that it's very much a ballad radio would love to get their hands on. While it's not my favorite ballad, it's certainly another top-notch tune on an album that seems full of them. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Nothing Lasts Forever: Nice guitar arpeggios on a more soulful kind of pop song, it's a good song which is helped by Adam Levine's vocals. My one complaint: the beat, mainly in the drums, makes it a bit more faster song than usual. But then again, what do I know? 8/10 <br /> <br />Can't Stop: Would make a great single, it's hard-hitting (well for them anyway), with a catchy verse riff and equally catchy chorus, it's so good loud. Bridge is kinda odd but oh well. 8/10 <br /> <br />Goodnight Goodnight: The 2nd of the 4 I wasn't initially a fan of. Guitar arpeggio sounding suspiciously like 3 Doors Down Kryptonite, what knocks the song is the repeated use of the word \\"goodnight\\" in the chorus. It's a nice, albeit maybe a bit too slow of a song but it's not a filler, just may be a grower. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Not Falling Apart: Strangely, it's my favorite song on the record. I love the chorus, Adam's vocals and despite the Every Breath You Take-like guitar, it would probably be my pick for the \\"ballad\\" single on the record. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Kiwi: Very funky rock although to be honest, this was one of the 4. Like Little of Your Time, you'll probably like it but probably not at the level other songs had. Nice job on that big solo though. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Better That We Break: A lovely piano ballad based around the piano, it's a song that'll get the Bics out during the live performance. Nice vocals and you can almost feel a show on the CW will latch onto this as someone breaks up with someone in the rain. 8/10 <br /> <br />Back at Your Door: Very waltz-y and comes with the strings and everything. Although it probably would've worked better to end the record with a rocker, it's still a lovely closer. But I must say this is the 4th. Maybe it's because the last half is very ballad-heavy. 8/10 <br /> <br />This is a very polished record which might turn off some people since there's a kind of sheen production through it all and it might not feel as honest and raw but almost tweaked to death but still considering the songs on it, that's a small thing to quibble about.
B00005JPFH|4.0|I saw SM3 yesterday, and needed a night to mull it over to decide if it was worthy of a four star rating.  At times, sitting in the theater I hated this movie during the romance conflicts between Peter and MJ.  During the action scenes, I loved it and couldn't get enough.  I kept thinking of other superhero movies that had made it to part 3, and what they had in common with this one.<br /><br />SpiderMan 3 definitely has it all.  There's romance with Peter and MJ on the verge of collapse.  Goblin Junior is still trying to take over Harry.  There's personal conflict when Spiderman becomes the darker side.  And there's super villains for Spidey to fight like Sandman.  What's important here is what Stan Lee said a few years ago for a TV special, \\"Spiderman was always supposed to be different.  He's a college student with his own problems and trying to get the girl, but there's the struggle for his inner superhero to save the city. That's quite a bit of responsibility.\\" So, the director of this movie had quite a bit of responsibility too when it came to making this film.<br /><br />SM3 stays true to Lee's overall concept, although they do stray a bit from the original comic books in order to gel all of these storylines together.  The audience assumes that Topher Grace's dark side is Venom, Spiderman's worst enemy ever.  However, you are never told that in the movie.  Also, he's just another kid reporter taking photos.  Not an astronaut as he was in the comics.  Venom's reign lasts all but a few minutes here.  The true villain that we love to hate is Sandman, but you won't find yourself hating him here either.  He too is wrapped up in where he went wrong in life, escaping jail and unable to see his sick kid daughter.  He uses his powers just to rob a few banks, instead of trying to take over the world.<br /><br />Then, there's Goblin Junior.  There's an awesome battle scene between he and Parker at the very beginning, but then Harry forgets all about it and forgets who he is for a while after a bump on the head. I think this is because Goblin Junior had to be in the film since they left him wide open in Part 2, but they didn't want him to be the center of attention.<br /><br />And then there's Mary Jane.  She's a Broadway star.  Peter is going to propose.  Then MJ gets fired and Peter is too wrapped up in his Spiderman stardom to show her some sympathy.  As his darker side, he embarrasses her in a nightclub in an over-the-top cheesy dance scene where Peter is still craving to be the center of attention.  This storyline goes on and on and on, until Goblin Junior finally wakes up in Harry's head and forces MJ to break Peter's heart.  Again, GJ is quickly swept under the rug while we focus our attention on Peter defeating his dark side and Venom being born. The approach they took with GJ in the very end is a nice surprise (I won't spoil it for you here).<br /><br />So, in comparison with other superhero films, let's think about Batman.  Part II of the BM series was the first to approach there being two villains at once.  Burton kept it dark like the first one. Catwoman and Penguin were awesome.  Two totally different storylines that merge to defeat the caped crusador, but not too much for the viewer to keep up with on the big screen.  That was not true by the time we reached Part III and IV of the Batman legacy.  Plots were all over the place with multiple villains, bright lights, and way too much action that just made the movies silly.<br /><br />X-Men's Part III suffered because of too many mutant characters and underdeveloped storylines, and too much of the main characters we'd already seen in the first two; not to mention killing off 3 major characters all within 30 minutes.  These movies try to go all out and overwhelm us with special effects and poor character development.  I don't think SM3 suffers from that at all.  We do have 5 storylines: MJ and Parker, Goblin Jr and Harry, Dark Spiderman, Sandman, and Venom.  But they do fit together nicely.  There's romance, personal and superhero conflict, action, and villains.  I was never lost in the film or felt like they had left something unexplained.  No one was over-the-top and domineering of the storyline, leaving the other stories lacking at all.<br /><br />So, overall, I do think this is one of the best third films in the superhero franchise.  Yeah, I did want more of Venom and Sandman, but I kept having to remind myself that there was already a lot going on here.  SpiderMan II still remains my favorite to date out of all of them, but I will definitely be adding SM3 to my DVD collection!nal and superhero conflict, action, and villains.

1594489505|4.0|\\"Kite Runner\\" was such a surprise--it just hadn't occurred to me that somebody would write a story from the perspective an Afghan boy-growing into manhood-thru the Taliban and eventually immigrating to the USA to tell his story...<br /><br />I'm so glad that Hosseini has more stories to tell of Afghan hell. Ha! I rhymed!<br /><br />In \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" we follow the story of two women, Marian the bastard daughter of a wealthy businessman, and Laila-a neighborhood girl-who eventually joins Marian's family. Initially, the similarities to Kite Runner are time and location. I found myself wondering here-how will the mere sex of a person influence the proceeding story in pre-Taliban/post-Taliban society...We follow the two characters as they struggle to lead a good life with a cruel man in an even crueler society. It's dark-very dark.<br /><br />Like \\"Kite Runner,\\" Hoseinni's prose is raw, honest yet simple and clear. The themes are similar--both are about lasting friendships and the devotion (life risking at times) that one human may have for another. Both stories are historical yet contemporary. And again, both stories make marked contrasts between traditional Afghan customs and Western civilized values.<br /><br />\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" will compel you to identify intimately with the suffering of people you knew nothing about. It is an instant literary classic-a real \\"tour de force.\\"<br /><br />But I still liked \\"The Kite Runner\\" better.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Some viewers find this films lack of clarity (its absence of clearly defined themes) to be frustrating but I think Cuaron is purposely leaving things in a tangle because in his (and PD James) future (which is, of course, really the present) things are in a tangle. In Children of Men, as in our world, no one knows who to trust or what to value anymore (except Michael Caine) and this is the feeling Cuaron is attempting to capture. What is frustrating to some critics and moviegoers (some complain that it is never clear just who is fighting who and for what) is really what is drawing others to this film and earning it all kinds of rave reviews because this film seems to tap into the global zeitgesit like no other film has attempted to do since, well, Inarritu's Babel. Both films seem to come from a similarly styled global consciousness that mistrusts rhetoric from the right or from the left and makes its appeal based purely on visceral visuals.<br /><br />Why are the Mexican filmakers so good at thinking in global terms? Hard to say, but maybe for the same reason that the Irish (Wilde, Joyce, Beckett) were so good at thinking in global terms during the last century. Both the Irish of the 1880-1950's and the current Mexican film makers live in the shadow of an opressive empire that seems to think it has the right to call the shots for all humanity. Hubris is always a turn-off (and not just the hubris of the extreme right but also the reactionary hubris of the extreme left). Any kind of national or cultural or other form of hubris perpetuates itself by neutralizing all points of view that challenge or counter its own. What the Irish literary community did in their moment in time is very similar to what the Mexican film community (and by extension the entire international film community) is trying to do now and thats to avoid polarizing political rhetoric and make an appeal based not on an aesthetics & ethics delimited by selfish nationalistic concerns but to create a more global aesthetic & ethics which amounts to nothing less than an attempt to evolve a new phase of humanism. This certainly is an ambitious and utopian project but its what humanism has always attempted to do: extend our vision of what qualifies as humanity in the first place.<br /><br />What we need now are leaders/artists who are also thinkers that understand the limits of any one \\"vision\\" of what humanity is as well as artists/leaders who understand that each human is going to define themselves in their own way and not according to some nationalistic policy that throws arbitrary borders around property as well as people. For artists like Cuaron the blurring of borders and the mixing of cultures does create confusion and chaos but its a productive and fertile chaos out of which arise new versions of what makes us human in the first place.  Artists are obviously comfortable, even inspired, by chaos. Unfortunatley (some) politicians feel the need to govern it by keeping things neatly compartmentalized: east/west, north/south, first world /third world, empire/colony, center/margin. But the world is becoming less and less compartmentalized every day--its slipping its bounds and its to artists like Cuaron (and Inarritu and Del Toro) that we look to see both what we don't want to happen and what we do.aesthetic & ethics which amounts to nothing less than an attempt to evolve a new phase of humanism.

B000O75F7C|5.0|Is this band freakin' amazing or what. They have got to be one of the best bands working today. I have never been disappointd by any of their albums. The only other band I can say that about is Enslaved. Is there the same musical composition? The same brilliant musicianship? The same incredible songwriting ability? Does Steven Wilson have the most immaculate sense of melody? The answer is a resounding yes to all. Gavin Harrisons drumming is phenominal and Richard Barbieri's key work is ethereal throughout. Listen how Barbieri weaves his keys around and behind Wilson's guitar playing. Brilliant!! So far, for 2007 the best song imo, is easily \\"Anesthetize\\" a massive and epic tune. I don't know, but we all better enjoy this while we can, having PT at our listening disposal. In my experience bands of this ilk only come around once every 10-15 yrs. 20 yrs from now will determine how important this music will become. The only quibble is the lyrics and concept, not Wilson's best. But the music, this is Godly stuff.

0393327655|4.0|One must use utmost caution when thrusting an accusing finger at others for not having enough evidence to support their claims, lifestyles, or beliefs. That simple logical manuever can slither back to the accusers and dig its fangs into their own beliefs and assertions. As many of us learned from playground law, those that bite can also get bit. Sam Harris, with inspiration from Bertrand Russell, boldly ventures into this volatile mine-strewn landscape in his controversial \\"The End of Faith.\\" In its wake a new movement has erupted, often called \\"The New Atheism,\\" within which, in addition to Harris, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and, of course, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, are depicted as pioneers challenging faith-based tradition. Their books and lectures sound a clarion call for people to start evaluating religious claims with the same criteria used in non-religious every day matters. In other words, justifications based on religious beliefs should have reasonable evidentiary weight behind them. If they don't, they should neither be accepted as good arguments nor as a satisfactory basis for decision making. Under these conditions, someone who claims that a damaging storm resulted from \\"God's will\\" or \\"God's wrath\\" had better have some pretty solid tangible testimony from the Supreme Head Honcho, not to mention indisputable evidence that such an omnipotent omniscient force exists. Harris places the onus on the utterer. In a Batman-esque ploy he uses intolerance against itself. He says we should simply stop tolerating explanations that do not conform to the way the world really is. Not doing so, he continues, imperils humanity's very survival. But does Harris himself have enough evidence to sound this alarm? Can the faithful simply point the finger back at him and demand his evidence? And could he produce? Only further debate could answer this question.<br /><br />Religious faith and dogma have doubtless contributed to a great deal of misery throughout human history. Harris discusses two infamous examples in the book's third chapter: the Inquisition and the Holocaust. Both exemplify incomprehensible human acts and Harris argues that religion, in this case Christianity, provided the fuel for both. But the book saves most of its vitriol for Islam. An entire chapter, called \\"The Problem of Islam,\\" compares the morality of modern Islam with fourteenth century Christianity. Harris quotes from the Qur'an extensively while arguing that Islam represents a death cult more than a religion of peace. In his view, Islam promotes martyrdom and the killing of infidels while promising a paradise of virgins and instant salvation for those who commit such acts. Add nuclear or biological weapons to the mix and, claims Harris, we have a recipie for the swift end of civilization. One of the book's most controversial claims also comes in this chapter: \\"We are at war with Islam. It may not serve our immediate foreign policy objectives for our political leaders to openly acknowledge this fact, but it is unambiguously so.\\" With this depiction, Harris attacks more \\"liberal\\" critics, such as Noam Chomsky and Arundhati Roy, who blame terrorist acts, such as 911, on American foreign policy. But the West is not immune, either. Harris, citing President George Bush, Justice Scalia, Jerry Falwell, and Tim LaHaye, finds medievalism alive and kicking in the current United States government as well.<br /><br />The book's final two chapters take on a smattering of topics: ethics and neuroscience, moral communities, the spectre of relativism, happiness, justification for torture as justification for modern war, the immorality of pacifism, the science of searching for the self, the illusion of the ego, eastern philosophy, meditation, and spirtuality and mysticism. Towards the very end of the book Harris claims, \\"Mysticism is a rational enterprise. Religion is not.\\" He depicts the mystical side of eastern philosophy as a scientific plunge into the boundaries ofconsciousness. Though Harris finds religious faith anathema, he does not throw sprituality in with the same dirty laundry. He truly sees a spiritual side to existence, though he argues that humans should approach it in a rational, critical manner.<br /><br />Of course one doesn't write such a book without inspiring a fountain of outrage. \\"The End of Faith\\" has inspired dread from all sides of the spectrum. Faithful believers of course resent its very core message, but atheists also find it disagreeable due to Harris' acceptance of spirituality. Some critics have found his delineation of Islam too trite, as if he learned about the religion only by reading about it. The book also sees nothing good whatsoever about religious faith, as if even the most isolated case of it somehow still seeps poison. But does a benign form of religious faith exist? A kind that doesn't extol killing, prosletyzing, or brainwashing. Does Harris mean to include any instance of religious faith whatsoever in his argument, or just the malignant hateful kind? He probably doesn't agree that the distinction exists. Also, has Harris, by his very intolerance for faith, alienated his target audience, namely, the faithful? The book speaks more to, and seems written for, the faithless. Had he toned down his message could he have reached a wider audience and brought about a worldwide questioning of faith? Hard to say. As it stands, the faithful will likely dismiss \\"The End of Faith\\" as arrogant atheistic dogma, which it most certainly isn't. Lastly, do Harris' arguments go deep enough or are faith and dogma simply symptoms of larger issues? We are, ultimately, wild animals harboring the illusion that we're tame. How much of what Harris attributes to faith should really get blamed on human nature? As a species of wet fleshy creatures, we seem to have an inimitable talent for finding baseless reasons to kill one another. Without religious faith we'll doubtless scrounge up other ingenious ploys. The book raises numerous questions, as most provocative books do.<br /><br />\\"The End of Faith,\\" love it or hate it, is ultimately a thoroughly engaging, thought-provoking, and jaw-dropping firebrand. It also contains unexpected twists and turns. People from all sides of the political continuum will find things to love and to hate, because this book does not aim to please everyone or even one camp. It takes a stand against religious faith and follows that line to its logical conclusion, or at least Harris' logical conclusion.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|Transport yourself back to 1977 when this film was first released.  I still remember the awe and incredible feeling when walking out of the theater after seeing Star Wars.  There had never truly been anything like it before.  Star Wars completely revolutionized cinematic films forever.  You could understand why suddenly hundreds and thousands of people all over the globe were standing in long lines waiting to get in to see this spectacular film.<br /><br />Every once in a while, sometimes a long while, a movie comes along that completely changes how movies are done.  They are so different, because nobody has done anything like it before.  Star Wars is such a film.  Perhaps no other film in history has had as much impact on today's culture and society that Star Wars has.  It operates on physical, philosophical, mythological, and even spiritual levels.<br /><br />\\"Jaws\\" may have set the standard for the typical summer blockbuster, but Star Wars blew the doors off, and in many ways, raised the bar dramatically for all films that would ever follow in its footsteps.<br /><br />Ironically, the story is a simple one, and George Lucas drew on many sources for his story that takes place in a galaxy far, far away.  He used old Saturday serials, Japanese samurai and mythology, as well as drawing a bit on King Arthur, and still others.  This helped to set up for one of the most incredible movies to ever grace the big screen.<br /><br />Lucas was also smart in setting up a merchandising line of toys, t-shirts, lunchboxes, etc, and sat back and watched as the millions of dollars rolled on in.<br /><br />The Empire Strikes Back is, in my opinion, the best Star Wars film of the six, but the original Star Wars is tough to beat.  How many kids dreamed of being taken away from their hum-drum life (like Luke on the farm) to suddenly find themselves immersed in a huge galactic adventure, complete with a beautiful princess to rescue, and being the hero who destroys the massive Death Star.<br /><br />We saw things that weren't really popular until Star Wars revealed them.  We saw laser blasters being used, flying spaceships that engage in dogfights in outer space, strange and exotic creatures, and one of the ultimate items, the lightsaber.

B000MV9026|5.0|I try to buy every animated film I can find but was rather hesitant about this one.  I do not like tap dancing.<br /><br />I was wrong!!!<br /><br />This is without a doubt, hands down, no hesitation the best animated film I have ever seen.  The story line is great.  When it starts to get \\"mushy\\" it becomes funny again. When you think you know where it is going it throws you a curve.  The animation and artwork are perfect and the backgrounds are some of the best I have seen - animated or otherwise.<br /><br />This film will go down in history as a rival to Disney's Fantasia and that is saying a lot.<br /><br />Take my advice and buy this DVD.  I promise you won't be sorry.  Your entire family will love it!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|A simply excellent Bond continuing the legacy of Broccoli Productions that has left the world with the icon of intrigue and espionage.  This new release with Daniel Craig as the new Bond is simply a briliant comeback for a film franchise that, in terms of plots and iconic significance, was losing its appeal as the fossil of a cold war entertainment dinosaur.  <br /> <br />Here Casino Royale is revamped with a credible plot and a more dynamic Bond who is clearly a vulnerable human being rather than a superhero of the espionage world who never flinches.  Daniel Craig brings both vitality and vulnerability into the character of Bond and this brings a lot of tension into the story's plot.  Instead of just going through the motions of a predictable action-packed plot, Bond is filled with uncertainty as to the mission's players and ultimate success.  Judi Dench's cold beuraucratic and feminist \\"M\\" also adds a lot more tension into the plot than the franchise's previous stuffy and aristocratic \\"M\\" by virtue of her relationship to the still mysogenist Bond.  Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre is excellent as Bond's cold-blooded nemesis who plays for keeps. <br /> <br />A simply excellent beginning for this almost 50-year old franchise's 6th replacement for Bond.  Replacing Pierce Brosnan was no easy task and it is hard to fathom how they could have found someone better than Craig to replace him.  This is certainly one of the most memorable Bonds to have been produced and it is worthy of purchase. <br />
B00004Y6O9|5.0|If you are a fan of heavy metal at all, you simply have to have this record.  This is the album that kissed disco goodbye and ushered in a new era of heavy metal that brought us Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Cinderella, Motley Crue, and others.  Eddie Van Halen's outstanding guitar work is best demonstrated here than on any other release by the band.  In Eruption, he really lets it all hang out.  You Really Got Me gives the original Kinks' single some extra punch.
1582701709|1.0|Goes a long way towards explaining infanticide and paedophilia.  All those kiddies and their negative thoughts...
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|Bought this film for my dad, who plans to give it to their family friend.  From their comments it is one of the greatest films of its nature for about forever.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Does the end of the world scare you?  Do you stay awake at night wondering when those madmen will finally really do it?  Does the idea of a mushroom cloud strike terror in your heart?<br /><br />Then you my friend need to sit down and watch Dr. Strangelove or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.  This entertaining and educational(dare I say edutaining?) film shows you what would really happen if a United States Air Force Commander ignored the requirement for Presidential authorization and simply attacked the Soviet Union on his own initiative.  All the safeguards that are put in place to prevent such an action come crashing down and conspire against those racing to prevent nuclear armageddon.<br /><br />See fighting in the war room!  Learn about the big board!  Find out the truth about fluoride!  See the dedication of US military servicemen in the face of illogical orders and impossible odds!  Discover the secret of Dr. Strangelove!<br /><br />If you don't see this film, you won't just have to answer to me and the United States Government, but also to the Coca-Cola Corporation.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I don't know that I would agree with one of the spotlight reviewers who says some performers from Jersey have a blue collar work ethic that is manifested in their styles (his examples: Springsteen and Bon Jovi who have an \\"everyman's character\\" that translates to musical drive-), but there certainly is an undeniable energy that My Chemical Romance brings to its music. It's enough to pique your interest if only because it beckons you in such a lively manner.  But there's much more on The Black Parade. These guys demonstrate that they are not merely another motley crew (sorry) of angst-ridden boys who smear their faces with makeup; they are genuine, contemporary balladeers with an original sound. So, while you may detect hints of Queen and undisguised influences from other bands, what My Chemical Romance provides here is their own interpretation of alienation, irreverence, and nihilism. Yet, amidst the seamy morass, there is a contradictory message as well: it's the brighter image camouflaged within. Communicated at times in a somewhat cheeky manner (you can feel the smirk), the suggestion is nonetheless present. If you will, just when you thought it WASN'T SAFE - out from their images of darkness (read death)comes the light (rebirth); despite the absurdity, there is still reason; in the midst of despair there can be hope (perhaps a continuing homage to the band's original 9/11 inspiration).  This lyrical irony reveals a sophistication that belies the group's apparently typical character. With that in mind, there are several selections here that will catch your ear and hold your attention - like THIS IS HOW I DISAPPEAR with its pronounced rhythm accents and flashy guitar riffs- and other surprises galore, including a Liza Minelli cameo on MAMA.   Then, just when  you thought you were taking a journey through alternative rock, you will suddenly realize that you've become the unwitting captive of one of their fetching pop hooks, such as the number, DISENCHANTED, matchedin type, if not tone, by FAMOUS LAST WORDS. Indeed, these two tracks are very clever pieces of song-writing craftsmanship that allow the band to stretch out and enable the front-man vocalist, Gerard Way, to showcase his best as well.    In the end, The Black Parade is entertaining both in its thematic approach and musical diversity, making for a Sgt. Pepper-like sound experience. Truth be told, this was my first exposure to MCR, but now I'll probably be seeking more.
B000NA1XSA|2.0|If you think only Paul McCartney is the ONE TRUE GOD then this is the book for you.  If you like the whole group, avoid it like the plague.  What a waste of my time.  He spends most of his time cutting down poor George Martin, this guy either had no control over the final version or he's a back stabbing scumbag.
B0000AUHPK|4.0|I enjoyed this film from beginning to end and recommend it.  I'm not sure exactly why I didn't give it five stars.  Perhaps because it failed to live up to my memory of the book, which I read  many, many years ago and my memory of  the Lawrence Olivier screen version.  Both of those probably formed \\"my\\" Heathcliff, which was different from Ralph Fiennes'.  \\"My Heathcliff\\" was stockier, more physical, craggier, (looking more like Beethovan!)  Fiennes' is more mental and serpentine.  <br /> <br />However all of that is personal and Fiennes' performance is certainly powerful and convincing.  I felt a sympathy for him, too, even in his last, most monstrous days.  The scene in which he grabs Cathy from the coffin is memorable. <br /> <br />I was a little disappointed in the performance of Juliette Binoche.  There was something unconvincing in her Cathy. Another reviewer suggested that she lacked the necessary qualities to play an English country girl. I'm not sure exactly how to define those qualities but I tend to agree with that comment.  Perhaps she was less firey than the original. <br /> <br />I agree with others, too, that the sequences were choppy and somewhat rushed, especially in the second half.  But it's hard to fit all of the novel into two hours.  I did like the ending a lot. <br /> <br />In sum, it's a great story, very well done and certainly worth watching.
0790740443|5.0|Not a huge budget killer movie, but definately a good movie to watch if you like future scifi movies.  Kurt Russell does a really good job of playing the emotionless killing machine without feelings.  Upon becoming \\"obsolete\\" and tossed with the garbage, he never loses the spirit of a hardened soldier.  Cool effects and weapons, gotta love the chain gun in any movie.  Worth buying on Amazon if you like future scifi and/or Kurt Russell.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Very good movie. I personally think that Blood Diamond or Pan's Labrynth deserved its spot as Best Picture Nominee, but still very good.
B000OONTFU|5.0|Stunning. Absolutely stunning. I was unsure about buying this set due to the price tag and also to the fact that I already own the first two movies. Then they released clips of the trilogy through the Xbox Live marketplace and I was hooked. The downloaded clips were only in 720p but they were enough to have me wanting more. I sprung for the Ulimate collection on HD DVD and I was not dissapointed. <br /> <br />The visuals, immaculate. The sound, sublime. This truly is the LOOK AND SOUND OF PERFECT. These movies deserved more than any others to be made in HD. These films are THE definitive action flicks of this and perhaps any generation. They revolutionized the film industry and only they deserve to be presented in the most revolutionary technology. <br /> <br />ITS MATRIX IN HD DVD! What more do you need to know? Buy it. Now. You won't regret it.
B00005JPLW|3.0|Good movie with fantastic special effects. For an action movie it gets 4 stars. The film is brought down by 1 dimensional characters and not enough emotion. Even if it wasn't filmed in front of a blue screen, I still wouldn't have believed it happaned. For an epic it gets 2 stars. <br /> <br />Action movie: 4 stars <br />Epic: 2 stars <br /> <br />Overall: 3 stars.
B000002UB3|5.0|I've never been a big fan of the Beatles, but I wanted to hear this album after hearing Billy Joel describe how it inspired the structure of his \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\". This is a great album, and though I wasn't around when it was first released, it really was ahead of its time, as corny as that sounds. It was miles ahead of anything else being put out back then. If the rest of the Beatles' catalog is as good as this, I could definitely see myself becoming a fan.
B00005JK8K|1.0|The worst war movie I have ever seen. It is in no way realistic. And to call it an action movie is an insulting joke. War shouldn't be treated as \\"action.\\"
B000M5AJQS|3.0|I wanted to like this film. Before bashing me for having bad taste, keep in mind that Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films. This movie was fantastic up until the end. Every character (which are mostly unlikable) SOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!    was killed off needlessly at the end. Could someone please write a comment as to why it was necessary, then I may edit my review to 4 stars.
B000MV9026|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The March of the Penguins and looked forward to Happy Feet. Unfortunately this film was not what I was expecting and it could have been so good. I liked several things about Happy Feet! The cinematography and animation were great. The penguins were cute. The dancing penguin was an especially clever idea and his character was very charming. I believe this film could have been a terrific vehicle to show case some beautiful classical music instead of the rap music and lyrics that were used.  <br /> <br />I did not think that the sexual innuendos (introduced by a couple of characters) had any place in a movie that seemed to be aimed at children. Perhaps young children did not understand them, but what was the point in putting them in a film that previews cartoon penguins?  I'm sure children were begging to see this movie after all of the big advertising campaign. <br /> <br />I think that this was just another Hollywood film that was made to forward an agenda and then passed off as entertainment for children.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I saw this on PBS, and knew I had to buy it. For some reason, the product description lists four songs as not being on the TV broadcast, but they all were...  Anyway, this is a really good collection of music, and the performance is good enough to warrant owning both the DVD and the CD.  A word of advice--if you want to buy the CD as well, buy the one with bonus tracks--some of the best songs of the show (such as At the Ceili and Spanish Lady, as well as Mairead's Shenandoah) are only on that CD.  I am still amazed at how well Mairead can play the violin--while running around (barefoot, usually) on the stage. Chloe, Hayley, Lisa, Meav, and Orla are all incredible singers, and the background singers and instrumentalists are terrific as well. With a gorgeous Irish castle as the backdrop, how can you pass this up?
B0001IN0DA|3.0|Without judging the vast amount of special features, I'm going to say that Wrestlemania XX was not all it was hyped up to be.  Many of the matches were truly great, and the return of the real Undertaker was momentous, but it fell short in that typical WWE way and somehow managed to botch one of their potentially stellar main events into a laughably simplistic match that could have easily taken place on a TV show without notice.<br /><br />United States Championship<br />The Big Show (C) vs John Cena<br />Any match that features John Cena is bound to be a dissapointment.  I think the ECW fans at One Night Stand 2006 flawlessly summed him up and there's no need to do much else here other than say he can't wrestle, and his gimmick is by far the worst thing WWE has ever done in recent years.  I would much rather have the Katie Vick storyline brought back than see Cena in the WWE, much less as a main eventer.  He is a bumbling failure in this match, and the Big Show is not much of a wrestler himself, but at least he has the stage presence to make himself truly felt.  John Cena's victory here made the whole match like trying to swallow a bitter pill and throwing it back up.  (0/10 and that's being generous)<br /><br />World Tag Team Championship<br />Rob Van Dam and Booker T (C) vs Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak vs The Dudley Boyz vs La Resistance<br />Whoever devised this whole fatal four way tag, where only two men are in the ring, and any random person can randomly tag any other random person whether they're on their team or not, is an idiot.  Aside from the poor stipulations, the combatants were at their best and put on a great match.  (7/10)<br /><br />Chris Jericho vs Christian<br />The storyline behind this match was, uncharacteristic for the WWE, a good one and believable.  Christian's already proven to me at Insurrextion 2003 that he's an astounding singles wrestler, and Jericho is great on his own.  They put on a superb match that really stands out in the night.  (8/10)<br /><br />Rock 'n Sock Connection vs Evolution<br />This one was hyped up to a point of awkwardness.  The promo Randy Orton did with Batista and Ric Flair at his side was a complete fumbling that made me smack my forehead at how awkward it was.  The friendship in the ring between The Rock and Mick Foley is awkward as well.  Foley pretty much summed up the match in the extras post-match interview: \\"It wasn't my best\\".  We all quite saw it out there too.  (3/10)<br /><br />Evening Gown Match<br />Sable and Torrie Wilson vs Jackie Gayda and Stacey Kiebler<br />Was there even a point in them getting dressed in gowns?  They just stripped down to their bra and panties before the match started and spent a good 3 or 4 minutes bouncing around Diva-style (ie, not wrestling) and showing the crowd their butts and crotches.  I can't even justify this with a rating.  It was not good.<br /><br />WWE Cruiserweight Championship Cruiserweight Open<br />Chavo Guerrero (C) vs Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble vs Billy Kidman vs Ultimo Dragon vs Little Guido (I mean, Nunzio) vs Tajiri vs Funaki vs Shannon Moore<br />I think this was perhaps one of the best matches of the night.  It wasn't long enough, but virtually everyone was high impact and at their best.  One by one, superstars would battle one-on-one battles, defeat their opponent, and another would come in.  The only disappointment was Chavo's \\"cowardly heel\\" ending.  (10/10)<br /><br />Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar<br />Both men were about to leave the WWE, and I guess the fans knew it.  I had read that the fans abused both men, hated them both for leaving, and really tore into them.  I'm guessing whoever wrote that never saw an ECW match.  The fans really seemed confused here.  They cheered Goldberg as he entered, they didn't seem to know when to boo as Lesnar and Goldberg stood off in the ring.  Only once did they start singing that goodbye song to Lesnar, and they seemed really confused whether to cheer Goldberg or not.  The match was very low-impact, and it took a good five or six minutes for the two to start the fight.  A huge disappointment.  The fans were confused and dumb as ever, only cheering when Stone Cold Steve Austin gave the stunner to both men.  (0/10)<br /><br />WWE Tag Team Championship<br />Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty (C) vs APA vs Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas vs The Basham Brothers<br />Again, the same stipulation as I mentioned in the previous tag team fatal four way.  Someone must have been drunk on the after-party wine already in this match, because Faarooq wasn't involved officially in the match at all, Bradshaw did very little, and all in all the match was very unimpressive from Shelton or Charlie or the APA.  It boiled down mostly to Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi vs The Basham Brothers vs Bradshaw.  The Bashams seemed to receive most of the attention from the bookers, and did the most in the ring.  (4/10)<br /><br />WWE Women's Championship<br />Molly Holly vs Victoria (C)<br />The stipulation of this match stated that if Molly lost, she'd get her head shaved.  Guess what happened.  Yeah well like I have said many times before, if WWE refuses to let it's Women's division rise above mediocrity, they shouldn't populate their expensive PPVs with lousy women's matches! (0/10)<br /><br />WWE Championship<br />Eddie Guerrero (C) vs Kurt Angle<br />This match was heavily built up with all sorts of emotion in the storyline and both men were given over 20 minutes to battle.  Compared to Guerrero's main event match the month before against Brock Lesnar, this one was mediocre.  This one could barely qualify as \\"average\\" on a regular Smackdown show.  As this was a Smackdown main event, and Smackdown is always the second-rate show, this one was done before the RAW event and even before the Undertaker and Kane match.  The only good part was Eddie Guerrero's unique way of screwing Kurt Angle by pretending his ankle was hurt, unlacing his boot, and when Angle comes at him with an ankle lock, Eddie slides out by yanking his foot out of his boot.  (4/10)<br /><br />The Undertaker vs Kane<br />This had been built up for months after the Undertaker was buried alive at Survivor Series 2003.  It's a good thing they buried that American Bad Ass biker gimmick, and brought back the REAL Undertaker---the Deadman.  Unfortunately, he still wears that stupid biker tanktop, and his Sara tattoo is very noticeable.  Kane is not the same Kane, but rather a fat bald idiot who is truly ugly and a poor wrestler.  At least Undertaker returns truly  (6/10)<br /><br />World Heavyweight Championship<br />Chris Benoit vs Triple H (C) vs Shawn Michaels<br />I was expecting wonders from this match based on all the other reviews.  I was expecting some tour de force that WWE has been severely lacking.  I was severely disappointed by the hype.  Triple H barely does much, while Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels have some entertaining back-and-forth action, but mostly it boils down to brawling, with 70-80% of the match being made up of pillowstrikes and basic generic brawler moves like DDTs and Suplexes.  The only really amazing point in the match is where Michaels and Triple H doubleteam against Benoit and suplex him from atop the Spanish Announcer's Table onto the Smackdown Table.  Everything else hardly qualified as average.  Like the Smackdown main event, it qualifies as a \\"good\\" main event for the average RAW show.  (5.5/10)<br /><br />All in all, it was a decent Wrestlemania, but the failure of the main events and the lackluster events numbering more than two makes this three out of five stars, unfortunately.  Bad bad bad WWE.  For shame.he fight.  A huge disappointment.  The fans were confused and dumb as ever, only cheering when Stone Cold Steve Austin gave the stunner to both men.

B000NQPZCY|4.0|This is a pretty good film for a quiet night if you want some action and drama. Blu Ray Picture quality is very good and the extra bits(unrated) in the movie  .....well I won't say anything and will keep it a surprise. Worth while to add to your collection.
0930289455|5.0|I started reading Birds of Prey way before I read The Killing Joke and, I must say, the anticipation only added to my complimenting opinion towards this edition. I have never seen the Joker quite like this and, for some reason, his portrayed insanity seemed to fit even more now than ever before. The things that the Commisioner Gordon had to go through made me shiver. And seeing those naked pictures of Barbara, the intense expressions on his face while they forced him to look, almost made me cry. Those parts alone can emminate anger, sadness, sympathy, and all sorts of other emotions from a reader. If you have weak stomach for corrupt storylines, you shouldn't read this.  But, I for one, enjoyed this very dark twist for the Batfamily's very first female member, and one of the initial villains that started it all.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This album does everything just right.  The songs are great, which we've known for decades, but we have never heard Neil sing like this, connect with the audience like this, strum like this...  This is a great song collection, AND a great performance, AND a great recording, AND possibly the best window we have on a great talent.  You don't need to be a Neil Young fan to be moved by this recording.  Beautiful!<br /><br />Listen with good headphones. The recording quality is remarkable, and Neil's subtlety, almost inaudible on other albums, is clear and detailed here.  I believe this recording reaffirms his position as one of our greatest performers and craftsmen.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I had given up on anything clever ever making it as a series till I stumbled upon the premiere of Dexter.  Creepy, but not overly graphic (so far) its whats implied that makes your skin crawl. Even the opening credits raise the hairs on the back of your neck! Hearing Dexter's thoughts was a great idea.  His complete disconnect as he intelligently surveys the world is almost poetry in itself. The black comedy relief is also hysterically funny. I did think the show started out more cleverly then got a bit less interesting as it evolved with his relationships.  But I am nit-picking as Dexter is so refreshing and smart. I think the show's at its best when isolated Dex is alone with his thoughts as he passes through the streets among the unsuspecting, speaking to us from his mind. The brooding music certainly keeps things eerie and, oddly enough, somehow sensuous.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.  Julia is beautiful and Harrison does an amazing job, far from his usual role of treasure hunter.  If this remake doesn't get you then the music will, it is a romantic shiny movie and I cry every time I watch it.  Yes, I am a girlie girl.  Then there's Sting, ahhhh, \\"In the Moonlight.\\"<br /><br />I heart this movie.
B0000DG00B|5.0|I went to this festival. The Allman Brothers were smokin' - as you might have guessed. Then, so was everyone else. Whipping Post was like a nuclear bomb pressure wave in the face. <br /> <br />Think I'll get this....fun for me - and my six year old son. He rocks hard.
B000024JEX|4.0|Keith Jarrett is one of those guys whose stuff I have bought but I feel very ambivalently about. Indeed often after hearing 10 minuets of his stuff I will find it great and think this is the only music I will listen to but then quickly the repetitious nature of the sound (not so much of the music) tires me very quickly. That was of course the case with the splendid Sun Bear Concerts and here again we have another hefty and expensive (as usual with ECM) CD box: 6 CD's covering a series of concerts he did at the Blue Note. However some of the stuff is really splendid as usual Also he has Jack De Johnette on here so who can complain: well me because it is expensive, repetitious and over-long. But then I did know that it would be like that when I bought it, didn't I?
006091307X|2.0|One problem with social satire, even at its most perceptive and subversive, is that it becomes dated almost immediately if the author focuses on current trends and cultural references. This novel by the otherwise masterful Pynchon might still be useful for fans of his experiments with language and his unconventional plot constructions. But for the rest of us, this book's badly outdated references, overwrought prose, incongruous conspiracies, and sheer mid-60s detached irony are tiresome and increasingly pointless. It was surely the fashion of the time, in satirical writing, to construct a shell of a plotline that is then used to explore eccentric characters and their shallow connections to the impersonal anomie of modern life. Fair enough, but the hipsters and literati of 1966 were probably the only parties likely to be wowed by this book's self-obsessed puns and inside-joke allegories. But even if you can stomach the dated references, this novel's laborious dialogue and shallow character interactions all swamp a thin plotline that goes nowhere except for the unenlightening self-knowledge gained by the already very thinly-constructed lead character. This novel is probably still a worthy masterpiece for those readers who find it rewarding to conquer a novel that makes reading a work of labor. But for those looking for enlightenment, or even just a rewarding or fun challenge, you'd surely prefer something more timeless and less self-obsessed. [~doomsdayer520~]

B000FQJAIW|4.0|My fondest memory of \\"Star Wars\\" in 1977 was going to a special preview screening at a mall in Kansas City (nyah-nyah-nyah... I saw it before you did!) with some adult companions in tow... Opinion pollsters were crawling all over the mall, interviewing people about the film (and offering them a few bucks for their time!) and one of the guys I saw with, a hippie named Kirk, took the poll, got his silver dollar and told the guy that the special effects were amazing.  The thing was, we were still wandering around the mall, waiting for the second show... and hadn't seen the movie yet!  It didn't matter -- Kirk was just telling the guy what he wanted to hear... And besides, it was true: for the time, the special effects were great!<br /><br />Like many people of my generation, I saw \\"Star Wars\\" several times that summer (seven times, total, I think...) though I didn't geek out on the sequels and drifted away from the fold as I got older.  Still, I read about George Lucas's obstinant refusal to reissue the original '77 version with something close to revulsion.  So what if he's the film's creator?  Does that really give him the right to edit history, and to try and make people believe the first \\"Star Wars\\" film -- a watershed in global pop culture -- was something different than it really was?  And besides, wasn't a huge part of the charm of the series how darn rickety the first film was?  When I finally saw the altered (1997) \\"special edition,\\" I was shocked at how clumsy and garish Lucas' digital updates were -- did he really think these were improvements?  Oh, well.  Nothing to get worked up about, I guess.<br /><br />I'm glad, though, that the original 1977 version is available again, and that modern viewers can see what the movie really looked like, more or less, back when it packed kids into the malls and moviehouses during the disco era.  Okay, maybe there are technical limitations and maybe Lucas is (inexplicably) feuding with his fan base, but at least having *some* unaltered version available is more intellectually honest (and historically valuable) than pretending that AVID decks, etc., were available all those decades ago.  It was a cheesy, exciting middlebrow action film: let's remember as it really was!ng *some* unaltered version available is more intellectually honest (and historically valuable) than pretending that AVID decks, etc., were available all those decades ago.

B000MQ54OO|3.0|Phew....both the PQ & SQ in this movie receive the ultimate rare 5-star rating!! However, unfortunately as the others have mentioned the movie is kind of a let down. I hardly could keep myself awake after the first 25 minutes.<br /><br />The consolation is my kids love it!
B000DWMN2S|4.0|It isn't necessary to have read the novel of the same name to understand and appreciate the film version. I didn't, and I still got Jonathan Safran Foer's point. Here he's played by Elijah Wood, and frankly I liked Wood better as Frodo. He had more character, more spunk and more depth.<br /><br />But the film is good nevertheless, thanks to Alex (Eugene Hutz)\\"Jonfan's\\" tour guide, whose malapropisms, in charming Russian-accented English, make the movie. This is a funny and poignant movie, at once.<br /><br />It's very easy, from the get-go to determine what's likely to happen, as Jonathan bags up bits and pieces of the past in Glad-Bag zip top sandwich bags, including the dirt from under his shoes, an occasional leaf, and just about everything else imaginable. As his grandmother lays dying, and hands him a yellowed photograph of his grandfather Safron with a woman named Augustina, who rescued his beloved grandfather before the Nazis invaded Ukraine, it's a sure bet he'll be off to find out more as soon as possible.<br /><br />Initially, it seems that Alex's family, particularly his strange, foul-mouthed grandfather (Stephen Samudovsky), accompanied by a female stray he named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., that Jonfan is about to disappear into the depths of antisemitic Ukraine. But what transpires is inspiring, even if predictable, and the scenery and Ukrainian music are awesome.<br /><br />This may be a first film, but Liev Schreiber directed a nice one here. And it's worth seeing, whether you've read the book or not. This is a nice one, sad, and by no means perfect, but heart warming all the same.

0805066691|1.0|What is depressing about this book is that thirty seven years after its publication most Americans are still so ill informed about the 19th century history of the West that they continue to give it rave reviews.  Mr. Brown was a gifted story teller but he was no historian (he was actually the librarian at the College of Agriculture at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana) and his account of the deeply moving and troubled tale of the clash of civilizations that was played out in the West (and it was truly a clash of civilizations: Irish-American vs. Anglo-American vs. Hispanic-American vs. Mormon-American vs. Union-American vs. ex-Confederate-American vs. New England American vs. Midwestern American vs. Brule Sioux vs. Northern Cheyenne vs. Southern Cheyenne vs. Blackfoot vs. Hopi vs. Navajo - and the list goes on) is, in my opinion, only slightly better than a caricature.<br /><br />One point can show this nicely.  Yes, annuities (in a variety of forms) were promised by treaty to Indians on reservations or residing near the various agencies.  And yes, frequently these annuities failed to arrive or arrived only in part.  But that is only part of  a much bigger picture.  At least in the area of governmental support, the Indians weren't being treated much differently than American soldiers.  In the years following the Civil War, Congress was loath to spend money on just about anything and frequently a good proportion of soldiers were AWOL working second and third jobs because Congress hadn't paid them.  The treatment of the Sioux and the Blackfoot and the Navajo (etc) by Congress is part of the larger story of Reconstruction and Immigration and needs to be read in that light.  It is very poorly served by the kind of bad White duplicity vs. good Indian honesty out of which Brown weaves his story.  It isn't that Mr. Brown's story is inaccurate, it's just very incomplete, and because of its incompleteness it presents a deeply distorted picture of this very important part of the American epic.  Read Brown if you want, but also read John Monnet, Vernon Maddux, Colin Calloway, and especially<br /><br />Robert Utley (personally I also greatly enjoy Mari Sandoz, but her work, although brilliant literature--I think it's the greatest writing the West has yet to produce--isn't universally admired by historians). At least that's my two cents worth.tant part of the American epic.

1582701709|4.0|'The Secret' is another name for the Law of Attraction, and the name of the book by Rhonda Byrne that helps to simplify this Law. This book was put together with quotes and contributions from many accomplished, successful contemporaries and figures of the past, with the purpose of helping people learn how to use the Law, thereby empowering themselves and enriching their lives.     This is, by no means, a new concept! The book makes this quite clear, with many references to both books and personalities that have taught principles related to the Law of Attraction. This book, however, is a more accessible, modern, an easily understood explanation of this Law than you might find elsewhere. 'The Secret' is small (around 200 pages), though the information might take awhile to fully digest and interpret.     In life, there are people who are successful, people who struggle, and those who are stuck flip-flopping between the two. Of course, the desirable position is one of success! But, how does one go about it? For starters, 'The Secret' says that a person's thoughts have immense power over the shape of their lives. When you want your life to go in a positive direction, you should think positively! But...this isn't particularly easy for most people! The point of this book is to guide the reader in understanding how to make the Law of Attraction work in their favor. We already use it every day, perhaps without knowing it. Bob Doyle, one of the 'Secret Teachers' featured in the book, says: \\"Most of us attract by default. We just think that we don't have any control over it. Our thoughts and feelings are on autopilot, and so everything is brought to us by default.\\" Once you've got a handle on your thoughts, you can manipulate your circumstances for better or worse; the Law doesn't discriminate based on what's negative or positive when it delivers what you focus on the most!     The goal is to get to the point where you are consciously striving to better your circumstances. 1)Ask, 2) Believe, and 3) Receive are the steps 'The Secret' recommends taking when one really wants something in their life. 'The Secret' emphasizes that having a deep desire and belief in something is more important than worrying and trying to figure out exactly how something is going to happen. The hard part is having faith something that hasn't manifested itself yet!     Some people might think that the principles of 'The Secret' are selfish and greedy. But, shouldn't every human being have the opportunity to lead a full and happy life? The Secret' emphasizes generosity (see the chapter on 'The Secret to Money', page 107) because part of the benefit of self-empowerment is that you can share your abundance with everyone around you and improve their lives, as well as your own. I don't interpret 'The Secret' as advocating a life of lazy, unproductive behavior. In order to have a 'total transformation' in your life, you've got to be applying this Law in all of the major areas (money, relationships, health, etc.), right down to the smallest details.  People who are wanting to use it to satisfy frivolous whims might succeed in doing so, but will those meager accomplishments lead to lasting happiness? I think not.     If this 'Secret' is the key to unlocking the potential of your life, then why did I give this book 4 stars instead of 5? Not all of the answers are going to be found here. I recommend that the reader explores other similar works (like Napoleon Hill's [[ASIN:1593302002 Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised]]) to motivate and help them along. There are people who claim that 'The Secret' has changed their lives. Yes, it is true that a book (or a mentor, a piece of music, etc.) can have quite a profound impact on someone's life. But, a given person has to find something within of themselves that allows them to carry out the necessary steps for improvement. Books, such as this one, can be tools in conjuring up what you've already got inside! All you need is the desire, the drive, and the ambition!
B000002UZU|5.0|In 1970 the blues-rockers Canned Heat got this, as it would turn out, great idea in bringing blues-legend John Lee Hooker into the studio for a close collaboration. The album was planned as a feature for John Lee Hooker in that respect that half of the album would mostly feature his solo stuff, where as the other half would be together with the group.     The amazing thing is that it brings the best out in John Lee Hooker, as he would deliver some of his most inspired performances ever - that also maybe due to the \\"Heat's\\" enormous respect for the man. Canned Heat had proved themselves to be among the most serious and properly best of the \\"white\\" American bluesbands with original compositions, especially by the late blues-harp `wonder' & rhythm/slide guitarist Alan Wilson - and by bringing in a slightly more `rocking' approach, they popularised a music that, at the time, seem to have faded away from the limelight (maybe some remembers hits like \\"Going Up The Country\\" or \\"On The Road Again\\").     Even more wonderful is the fact that the inspiration is mutual and Hooker's duets with Wilson's soulful harmonica, later in the first half, is literally sparkling - there is a fantastic communication between the two. But also the second half with the band is really smoking and I personally really like their bassist Antonio De La Barrada for his inventive and driving playing, but no doubt that Canned Heat fore and most was a group - a unit, and that really shows and because of their open, raw and honest nature, they musically fits so well with Hooker and makes him sound so great.     Canned Heat's lead-singer though, Bob \\"the bear\\" Hite, respectfully stands back and solely dedicates himself as a producer together with Skip Taylor. Unfortunately this also was to be Canned Heat's last album with Alan Wilson, who prematurely died soon after these recordings. A loss they properly never really overcame and their best work is also to found before this tragic event occurred with albums like: \\"Boogie With Canned Heat\\", \\"Live At Topanga Corral\\", \\"Living The Blues\\" and \\"Future Blues\\".      Many have acknowledged this work to be some of the best Hooker ever delivered - I for one agree.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|Sanrtbus breaks the mold!  Other movies of this genre either are rather boring (...) or have plots that are non-existent or downright silly.  Shortbus tells the story of several young New Yorkers in a search for love and meaning in their lives.  They endure a number of ups and downs during their quest but the movie ends with a satisfying and uplifting conclusion.  The movie is not shy about full frontal nudity and includes scenes of actual sex acts, but they fit into the story.  By the end you care about the characters and root for them which is a testament to the skill of the mostly unknown and largely amateur cast.  I would suggest you try Shortbus--it may not be your bag but it is worth a look.  I'd like to see more movies like it.
0743277457|5.0|I have actually met Josh Waitzkin, some years ago at the World Open Chess Tournament in Philadelphia. At the time I would guess him to be about 17. I was struck by his amazing PRESENCE, an uncanny ability to focus, and his legendary fighting skills. Even though by his biography he was already evidently dealing with the pressures of idolized adolescence, he was courteous, implacable, and \\"in the moment.\\" Being a passionate tournament chessplayer, I was in awe of him, especially at a creativity that I could only guess at, as he was rated some 800 points above me, the equivalent of the Jolly Green Giant wrestling the Troll under the bridge.<br /><br />One of my favorite movies of course is easy to guess: Searching for Bobby Fischer. It chronicles quite well Josh's journey through the mire of tournament life. Clearly, there are not many detailed works on the esoteric world of serious chess players. And this is a classic with rare footage of the maverick of chess, Bobby Fischer.<br /><br />This brings us to his latest endeavor, The Art of Learning. Josh does a marvellous job at detailing his history of chess learning as well as his fascinating pursuits of martial arts. Not having a background in either is not a hindrance to the kernals of truth that abound in this book. Quite simply, this is a phenomenal resource for those wishing to append their library with a very cogent and strong guide to personal excellence in life, having been written from the mind, and more importantly, the heart of a brilliant and extraordinarily gifted young man. Though clearly there are studies, books, and information galore on the subject of performance psychology, it is rare to have one so beautifully written that covers exceptionally the intricacies of body/mind relationships. Josh is a powerful soul in his search for ultimate meaning and contentedness in his life. This book serves to inspire on many levels. Though personally I have had limited exposure to martial arts (and I can use my previous analogy again here!), my expertise and journey fall more into the areas of yoga, massage therapy, and athletic training specific to triathlons. With some 40 races in my history, including the finishing of the Ironman Triathlon World Championship in Kailua Kona Hawaii in 2005, I was eager to hear the song of others who stop at nothing to delve fully into their mental psyches, spiritual cores, and physical guts. In this volume, I was touched by his elegant descriptions, his evident hard work, and most expecially that compassionate and tempered heart in his words. There is the sense of the ultimate competitor, who loves nothing more than a great, and fair, fight to determine mastery. And this is why I recommend this book so highly. Here is a most exceptional individual, who without rancor, ego, or any negative energy, gives us a unique view into his story, and mines for us true nuggets of truth that are so applicable to striving and surviving in today's world. Purchase this book, give it as a loving, passionate gift to those competing in any area, and use it again and again to reach the heights of excellence in your own life.previous analogy again here!), my expertise and journey fall more into the areas of yoga, massage therapy, and athletic training specific to triathlons.

B000LXH11C|5.0|THE ESSENTIAL ALAN PARSONS PROJECT, unlike THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION, covers only the years that Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson worked together, and thus includes many great songs not on the earlier set, including the entire title suite from THE TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD. Even so, some great songs, including \\"Breakdown\\" and \\"May Be A Price To Pay\\", are left off. As a result, to complete your Alan Parsons library, you need both anthologies, I, ROBOT, THE TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD, TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION, EYE IN THE SKY, and the work Parsons did for such artists as Al Stewart, the Beatles, and many others.
B000M06K5C|2.0|That tough second album. We've all heard it before, a band has a great debut only to stumble and fall flat on its face when they release the follow up. Bloc Party was one band I thought was quite immune to the notion of stumbling. After all, 2005's Silent Alarm was one of my favorites that year. Alas, 2007 has brought us Weekend In the City, that tough second album that really is, that tough second album.    It starts out extremely promising with Song For Clay, a song that, after an erie opening, quickly shotgun blasts into the familar guitars found on Silent Alarm, it's punchy, direct and a whole lot of fun to boot. The next few numbers, including Waiting For The 7.18 and Uniform, aren't as memorable. When we hit the record's fourth track, The Prayer, we can finally hear some new direction. The Prayer, which was the lead UK single, sounds off and devoid of a melody. This is mainly for the experimental road Kele and co. have taken rhythmically. He has said in many interviews that the drum track for The Prayer came from listening to an old Busta Rhymes song, the one with the elephants in the video, I'm sure you know it. I applaud them for trying something new, but the song's pacing is annoying, even after a few listens you can only start to hear a melody. The chorus, when it finally kicks in, is actually very good and it almost saves the tune... almost. Which brings us to the last half of the record and the main problem with the entire offering. It seems in the struggle to expand one's sound, Bloc Party have lost the one thing they did well, hook friendly melodies. Even the single, I Still Remember, would be one of the skippable tracks if it appeared on Silent Alarm. Other songs don't fare even that well. Again, the melodies and hooks are non-exsistant, making a song like Sunday, just passable, but just barely, much like this record as a whole. Its good, but in the end, it should've been A LOT better and a little bit more fun to listen to.

B000MV9026|3.0|This is a story about a penguin who doesn't fit in.  Amongst a family of singers, he has no voice.  However, his energy get's transferred elsewhere, and he can dance.  This movie features a great cast of voices such as robin williams, elihja woods, nichole kidmann,and britney murphy, but that just can't get you through some of the droneing that this movie seems to have in it.  It feels a lot like March of The Penguins at the beginning, but animated. But when they start to sing, it really gets boring after a bit, and makes the plot thin.  The ultimate thing is the spoiler of the political undertone.  It's not just a fun kid's movie, it is one that tries to make a big statement about humans changing the envioroment, a good message, but it's just sort of forced in here.  Overall a decent film to see once, borrow it if you must, so someone else who may have bought this can claim they got their money's worth.

First there were the problems with \\"The Good Shepherd\\", \\"Children of Men\\", and \\"Smokin' Aces\\" Universal DVD/HD DVD Combo Disks.  Toshiba blamed it on faulty disks, but oddly enough they released Firmware version 1.6 to fix the \\"not correct DVD format\\" problem. <br /> <br />Now I'm getting the same errors with my Ultimate Matrix disks!  Sounds to me like it's not a disk issue, but a Toshiba HD DVD player issue.  In other words, if you own any HD DVD player other than the MS Xbox 360 HD DVD player -- Toshiba makes every other player -- keep in mind the adage \\"CAVEAT EMPTOR\\". <br /> <br />IMHO, either wait for Toshiba to address future firmware issues in a timely manner, or wait for these titles to be released on Blu-ray.

1400034779|4.0|<br /> I'm a High school Freshman within the United States and as a class assighnment, I had to read the novel, The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency. I really liked this book because this book was so joyful to read and I learned many new things from this book such as about Botswana, Africa. Also, this book shows a protagonist, Mma Ramotswe, the first woman detective in Botswana and very independence woman and she solves problems such as, struggles between people and people. There are many interesting stories each chapters and almost entirely, I really liked it. But, this book is not that much serious as Sherlock Homes. This book consists with light stroies like we can often see in our surroundings. If you want to read really exciting and scary book, I don't want to recommand this book but if you want to read just light and interesting book, I'm sure that you are not goint to dissapoint. And also, if you are woman, I really recommand this book because, Mma Ramotswe is so great woman.
B000065VB9|4.0|Released in 1980, this came out when artistic music was moving from a progressive rock sound to new wave.  This album reflects that transition.   <br /> <br />Released before CD technology, this album is 45 minutes long.  The sound quality of the original CD was OK.  But, I can see (hear) where this remastered version might be somewhat better. <br /> <br />This is Gabriel's third solo album.  Like all previous two albums, the title is simply \\"Peter Gabriel\\".  People would call it \\"Melt\\" because of his slurred picture and to distinquish it from the earlier two albums.  Gabriel's fourth album would also be title \\"Peter Gabriel\\" everywhere in the world, except the US, where it would be called \\"Security\\". <br /> <br />This album has a transitional sound between progressive rock and new wave.  It sounds a lot like the new wave music that would be comeing out of the UK in the early eighties, especiall Tears For Fears. <br /> <br />Many people consider this to be Gabriel's best album.  But, I think it sounds a bit dated, especially when you compare it to the sensational So.  Still I think it is a very good album.  <br /> <br />Gabriel does begin to show the marks of maturity and significant song writing with Biko.  This is the type of song and music he would carry on in future albums.

It also has intense variety from new school pop-punkers like blink-182 and the Offspring, to old school punks like Bad Religion, the Descendents, and Black Flag to awesome bands I had never heard before--namely, the Dance Hall Crashers and H20 (Ha... I love their song on here). It is the epitome of punk samplers anywhere. However, not every song on here is good, and is just screaming. It's fun! It's short! What's not to love?  <br /> <br />Note: But be wary about doing anything after you listen to this CD. You're attention span will be shot.
B000000OPU|3.0|GABRIEL'S BLOCKBUSTER ALBUM. <br />RUINED BY MEDIOCRE SOUND QUALITY, KNOCKING A FIVE STAR CLASSIC DOWN TO THREE STARS.  DO NOT BUY THE ORIGINAL, BUT GET THE REMASTERED VERSION INSTEAD. <br /> <br />Released in 1986, this was Gabriel's blockbuster album.  And it deserved it.  This is just great from beginning to end.  It features great collaborations with Kate Bush and Laurie Anderson.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, coming out in 1986, the CD sound quality was mediocre.  This was very suprising for Gabriel who had embraced digital technology years earlier.  The sound is flat with limited dynamic range. <br /> <br />Many of the early CD's had mediocre sound quality, which gave rise to the vinyl snobs who thought CD's could never sound as good as LP's.  But, it was just a bad translation to the digital technoology.  Today, CD's sound much better than they did 20 years ago.  Which is why you see so many \\"remaatered\\" CD's today.  That includes the complete Gabriel catalog. <br /> <br />Not only being the most popular Gabriel CD, it is his best.  That is saying a lot since, he has had many very good CD's.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|When the Matrix was originally released on standard DVD, it was the movie that most people used to showcase their home theater set-up. It's only fitting that The Matrix once again helps usher in the new standard for the nex-gen format. For anyone that has been hesitant to jump into the new DVD format, this box set will make you a new convert. The films look and sound spectacular and are each loaded with extra content from the original release. A MUST have collection.
B000000OSW|5.0|Released in 1992, this could be considered the sequel to Gabriel's blockbuster So.  It is 57 minutes long and the sound quality is very good.  There is a remastered version available, but I don't know if it would be necessary to get. Gabriel's earlier CD's (especially So) had mediocre to poor sound quality.  So, the remastered versions are essential for those earlier CD's.  I don't know how much better experience you would get from a remastered Us (especially since I haven't heard the remastered version). <br /> <br />In 1986, Gabriel released the fantastic So.  It is a sign of the times.  In the sixties and seventies, an artist would do a follow up album within a year.  Starting in the late eighties, it is not uncommon for an artist to go 6 years between ablums. <br /> <br />Us could easily be considered So Junior, right from the two letter title, to cover of the CD, to the music style and song selection.  It is a very good follow up to So, but slightly disappointing.  It is not quite as good as So, and you would expect with 6 years, Gabriel would have topped So. <br /> <br />The main thing missing from Us is the great duets which highlight So.  But, Santana has proved that you can push the duet thing too far. <br /> <br />The great thing about Us is that it contains two clones of Shock the Monkey, Kiss That Frog and Stean.  So had only one Shock the Monkey clone, Sledgehammer.  But, I think that now, Gabriel has finally perfected the sound, and the songs on Us are much better than the earlier songs.  This is surprising, since clone songs like this usually come off poorly. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs on the Us are very good, but none reach the pinacle of the songs on So, such as Don't Give Up and Excellent Birds. <br /> <br />This is somewhere between a four and a five star CD.   <br /> <br />Gabriel would put a double live CD of the concert tour to support this CD, called Secret World Live.  It has some great moments, but also is weak in spots.
B000ENWKN8|4.0|A slight departure for Rob Zombie, \\"Educated Horses\\" veers away from the electronic effects and the sampling, that were so prevelant on classics like the \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" album, on most of its songs, focusing on a driving, hammering, metal assault led by great distorted guitar-work and Zombie's distinctive (and increasingly versatile) vocal performance.  The electronic/sampling elements are still present, popping up to fine effect on tracks like \\"Let It All Bleed Out\\", while techniques not usually associated with Zombie - like soft/acoustic guitars - turn up fairly frequently.  The atmospheric instrumental \\"Sawdust In The Blood\\" - both haunting and menacing - opens up the album and segues right into the instantly memorable future classic \\"American Witch\\". <br /> <br />  Most of the lyrics on \\"Educated Horses\\" are on the vague side, sounding kind of like songs based on horror movies yet to be made.  Creepy, well-crafted, and sometimes with a lot of between-the-lines subtext, they're the kind of songs you can something different out of on subsequent listens.  The song on here based on a horror movie that Has been made, is of course \\"The Devil's Rejects\\", based on the second of Zombie's 'Firefly family' films.  It ties in to the movie in a disturbing way, seemingly a reflection on how the Rejects see themselves and the world around them.  \\"Foxy Foxy\\" and \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" are also standout tracks that deserve a special mention, although there's not a weak song on the disc. It's still got pretty much everything that made the previous albums work, but expands with new angles.  I think there's a definate influence from '70s classic rock on here, although that influence has been fed through a steam-powered grinder to come out distinctly Rob Zombie.  \\"Educated Horses\\" is a 4.5 star album containing much of Zombie's best music to date.
0596007124|5.0|One of the best software books I have ever read. It covers concepts that every Java developer needs to know, and does so in clear terms, using excellent examples, with a sense of humor. Important concepts are emphasized and repeated just enough to reinforce learning, without being monotonous. The \\"why\\" behind the design of each pattern is also clearly explained, so that the reader gains a solid understanding of object-oriented design principles. As soon as I completed the first chapter, I had already learned concepts that I could immediately apply to my work.

B00011D1RC|4.0|This film doesn't seem that remarkable by today's standards, but in 1932 it was quite innovative. MGM used an all-star cast in a bracelet of intertwining stories that involved them all. The ballerina (Garbo) misses Russia, feels life is empty and pointless, and is saved from killing herself by the Baron (John Barrymore) who had been planning to steal her jewels to pay a large debt to some shady people that he owes. The stenographer (Joan Crawford) has set her sights on the Baron believing him to be rich, while she is being eyed by her employer, a wealthy industrialist (Wallace Beery) who is the former employer of a dying man (Lionel Barrymore) who intends to spend his life savings experiencing what he has been missing out on all these years, who in turn is befriended by the Baron. The only character who exists in isolation is Garbo's, who has a relationship with the Baron but noone else.<br /><br />This is the only film to ever win the Best Picture Oscar and be nominated for no other awards. This is not because the picture is a poor one. Instead it is probably because there are so many subplots and so many players that it is hard to zero in on any one of them and say a particular link in the chain is outstanding compared to the others and therefore deserves an award. However, altogether, the actors and subplots form an entertaining film.  Since this film was such a commercial success the entire formula was reused in \\"Dinner at Eight\\" the following year, and even used part of the cast from this film - John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Beery. Oddly enough that film was superior to \\"Grand Hotel\\" in many ways, but didn't receive any Oscar nominations.<br /><br />Finally, much has been said about Greta Garbo's over-the-top performance in this one. I have to admit, if this was my introduction to Garbo I would be asking myself what is the big deal about her supposed great reputation. She's practically playing Ophelia at certain points in the film. However, if you think about it, Garbo's portrayal is an appropriate one considering her character's circumstances. She was a  ballerina in Czarist Russia who has the world ripped out from underneath her as a result of the Russian Revolution. Now, late in her career, she is surrounded by sycophants and isn't even missed  when she runs out on a performance. The little documentary that comes with the DVD does a good job of explaining more about Garbo and her performance. There's no commentary track on this DVD. Instead there is a comedy short that parodies \\"Grand Hotel\\" plus some theatrical trailers and movietone extras talking about the premiere of Grand Hotel in addition to the mini-documentary I already mentioned., if you think about it, Garbo's portrayal is an appropriate one considering her character's circumstances.

0140544518|5.0|I stumbled on this one.<br /><br />This funny story is about Alexander T. Wolf as he explains his side of the story of the three little pigs.<br /><br />As he would have you belive he was maligned for having a cold and needing a cup of sugar for the cake he is making for his dear old granny.  He sets out to borrow one and twice he accidentally sneezes and blows down the straw house and the stick house.<br /><br />In both cases the pigs die and not wanting to waste; he eats them.<br /><br />Problems arise at the brick house.  The third pig says some mean things about the granny and he gets mad.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Richard Donner (Director of the LETHAL WEAPON movies, etc.) who directed the first SUPERMAN movie, was 75% finished with SUPERMAN II when the producers fired him. They brought in Richard Lester (A HARD DAY'S NIGHT) to finish the film.<br /><br />I've always thought SUPERMAN II is a fun film; when the supervillains are tossing manhole covers and buses at Superman, it really captured the feel of comic books in a way that hadn't been done before.<br /><br />But, 25 years later, the studio gathered together the old footage and decided to release a version that was more like what Richard Donner had in mind.<br /><br />Marlin Brando is back in the film in this version (he'd been axed over salary demands), so Suzanna York is out.<br /><br />There are more scenes with Gene Hackman.<br /><br />Lois and Clark's trip to Niagara Falls takes a very different direction.<br /><br />And the supervillain fight has less slapstick in it.<br /><br />This film is a strange artifact. It's not a better film than the Richard Lester version (I think one of the reasons the producers canned Donner, besides for the film going over-budget, was that they felt he was trying for a tone that was too epic and not comic-book enough). But if you're a fan of the original film (and perhaps even more if you disliked the original SUPERMAN II), it's a fascinating bit of alternate history.

B000002USN|4.0|\\"Audiences, as well as performers, enjoy this classic form of music--standards by great lyricists and arrangers that have withstood the test of time. I have great respect for a song and the creative process---from the writing to the arrangement to the performance. I like to paint, and in some ways the performance of a song--live or recorded--is similar, the completion of a beautiful piece of art.\\" ~ Frank Sinatra ~<br /><br />I've grown so used in listening to Frank Sinatra's solo albums from my collection particularly his concept albums. So when I first heard \\"Duets,\\" it was absolutely a breather and a novelty that will never wear off. It's also nice to hear Frank Sinatra singing with some of the best contemporary singers of today. It has been noted that Sinatra has wanted to record a duet album for quite some time and he was so glad that it has finally come into fruition. \\"Duets\\" may not be among his greatest albums of all-time, but it is still an enjoyable listening experience and each track deserves every Sinatra fan's welcoming ears.<br /><br />In this album, Frank Sinatra is paired with singers and musicians--the likes of Tony Bennett, Natalie Cole, Carly Simon, Anita Baker, Barbra Streisand, Luther Vandross, Aretha Franklin, Julio Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Charles Aznavour, Bono, Kenny G and Liza Minnelli. Each song is a charmingly rendered and there is something very special about each performance that the listeners will enjoy. He is on top form and seems to be thrilled as much as his co-singers in all the performances most remarkably his duet with Natalie Cole, \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me.\\" The original chart was written by Neal Hefti and arranged by Patrick Williams. The other noteworthy tracks that are so enjoyable include \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" \\"New York, New York,\\" the medleys of \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry/In The Wee Small Hours of The Morning,\\" \\"All The Way/One For my Baby,\\" with Bono, Tony Bennett, Carly Simon and Kenny G, respectively.<br /><br />The following are some of the nicest compliments to Sinatra by some of the people involved in this recording.<br /><br />\\"To get to sing with Sinatra is the biggest thrill in the world. ~ Tony Bennett ~<br /><br />\\"Sinatra walks into a room and the whole thing changes--everything changes.

0767812166|3.0|This filf has sentimental value to me, so that's why I'd ordered it. The acting's great but the story is alright. <br /> <br />Great seller. Overall, I'm satisfied.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I'm a huge Zimmer fan, and he has really lived up to expectations with this soundtrack. The music is just amazing: I could listen to it forever, and still not feel that I know it from start to finish. It's full of twists and turns, epic melodies and silly moments that don't cease to entertain. And listening to it really does put you back into the movie - it messes with your head. In a good way! <br /> <br />I also love that there are some choral bits in this album (The Brethren Court, I Don't Think Now is the Best Time). <br /> <br />On to the piece-by-piece run-through: <br /> <br />1. Hoist the Colours - 9.5/10: I love this. The boy's song, the drums and other pirates in the background, all make for a beautiful, haunting way to start off the soundtrack. I only wish they'd included more of it on the CD. <br />2. Singapore - 7/10: It's not my favorite because it's rather slow in places, but eventually it moves into that adventurous, swooping music that  you'd expect. <br />3. At Wit's End - 10/10: Brilliant! This serves as an intro to the action in the film. All the various themes are mixed in to make for beautiful, epic music. <br />4. Multiple Jack's - 7.5/10: This is really weird - it includes odd instrumental choices for a pirate movie. But it also works very well, because hey, it's about Jack Sparrow. <br />5. Up Is Down - 8/10: Upbeat and playful, it gives you hints of the main themes. <br />6. I See Dead People In Boats - 9/10: Slow and haunting.  Love the string instruments. <br />7. The Brethren Court - 8/10: Bits of the chorus and occassional increases in tempo make it work. <br />8. Parlay - 7.5/10: A little odd as it slinks into a sort of cowboy-style, but it keeps you on your toes. <br />9. Calpyso - 8/10: It becomes stronger a little past half-way.  <br />10. What Shall We Die For: 10/10: It's short and very powerful - one of my favorites. <br />11. I Don't Think Now Is the Best Time - 10/10: This is the biggie of the album. It manages to fit everything in for the climactic scene. Huge, grand, and epic. <br />12. One Day - 10/10: This contains a lovely new melody that I love. Bittersweet. <br />13. Drink Up Me Hearties - 9.5/10: The return to the original pirate theme is a great end to the soundtrack and movie.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|I was actually suprised by how nuch I enjoyed Shortbus.  It is at turns, funny and sad and of course, brutally frank.  The first sexual action made me sit up and think, \\"okay, here we go ..\\" but after that it all seemed as natural as everything else in the film.  The sex was funny and clunky and sexy - but natural in the context of the film.  All of the actors should be applauded for their courageousness in completing exposing themselves physically and psychologically.  I laughed quite a bit at their drama and was moved by the gentle humor.  A lot goes on here, but all of it is worthwhile.  The soundtrack also is excellent and highly recommended.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Planet Earth has to be one of the best Blu-Ray titles available today.  The scenes are incredible!  If you like animal/environmental documentaries, you will LOVE this series.   <br /> <br />My only complaint is that Sigourney Weaver is NOT the narrator as was the case when the series aired in the US Discovery Channel showing.  Even though, the images are spectacular and compelling.  I love it.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I listen to music a lot, and i get bored easily, most of the albums are off my ipod within a week, this has been in my ipod for a month now, i have many many albums, mostly indie rock, out of all the albums ive listened in 2007 this one is the best!!!    I rarely write reviews but i thought i should make this album justice, it doesnt get the attention it deserves, i thought i should let people know how great this thing is. So before you start reading just go buy this album, no matter what kinda music you like, you will %100 love this one.    So here goes the song reviews:    Henrietta - 9/10 A great great opener, not their best maybe but very very good, good representitive for the rest of the album.    Flathead - 10/10 Instant hit, best song ive heard in years!!! But it has an awful video, what great way to ruin such a song.    Whistle For The Choir - 10/10 What a beautiful song. Slower than the rest but gives me the chills each time i listen, amazing!    Chelsea Dagger - 10/10 Very much like Flathead, and probably the second single, another perfect song!    Gutterati?, The - 9/10 A little different than the rest of the album, very fast, good lyrics, another favorite.    For The Girl 10/10 I dont know how they do this, but this song will make you wanna smile, no matter what kinda mood youre in, \\"lalalalalalalala\\" oh so amazing!    Doginabag 7/10 Now things get a little bit low, still its good, Its a good song but since the album set the bar so high, it is a little dissappointing compared to the rest. Slower song.    Creepin Up The Backstairs - 10/10 Upbeat, fun, so catchy, makes you feel great!!!    Vince The Lovable Stoner - 8/10 Starts like a country song, in the chorus changes into the standard Fratellis style. Good song, but not great.    Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night - 9/10 Not as fast as the other upbeat songs, but no matter, its a great song, very catchy again!    Baby Fratelli - 9/10 Upbeat, fun, great song overall.    Got Ma Nuts From A Hippy - 9/10You will notice this one later than the rest, needs a few more listens than the rest to really appreciate. Another favourite!    Cuntry Boys And City Girls - 10/10 (Only on enchanced version) Now now, THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!! So cathy, upbeat, very fun to listen to, youll catch yourself singing it during the day. So if you cant get the enchanced version, be sure to download this, you wouldnt wanna miss this!      Well if you are depressed (like me) and need something to cheer you up, if you have a hard time realizing the beauties in the world, or you just want a fun upbeat album, GO BUY THIS!!!! Otherwise, GO BUY THIS AGAIN!!! This album is a must for every music listener!    Costella Music in my ipod + sunny weather = Happiness    Thats the formula of happiness people have been searching for years, believe me! ;)
B000BJS4OY|5.0|What can you say but \\"The Boss\\"  Springstein at his best.  I highly recommend this.
B000002V07|5.0|I am SO blown away with this album.  It is truly amazing if I can say so myself.  As an R&B and Hip Hop lover, male at that, I must admit that this album's music hits a whole other spot.  I can't wait to go and purchase (listened to most tracks from free downloads) because I have to support such outstanding art.  While everyone raves over the amazingly beautiful song, Fade Into You, i am so surprised that almost no one has mentioned my current second favorite, Into Dust.  That song I can listen to over and over and over and...<br /><br />This album is a must have.
0938045695|4.0|Pavel has written a truly fantastic book for the up-and-coming kettlebell lifter.  He starts small, with the basics and history of the kettlebell, working his way up to describe the challenge separating men amongst men.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a five, is I would have liked to see a few other variant exercises like the windmill.  But Pavel does explain why he did not include them, and shows great professionalism in his rationales.  Overall, a fantastic book for the beginner or simply someone who wishes to brush up on the basics.
0385611463|5.0|The Book Thief is so much more than a *young adult book! While written simply enough for a young adult to enjoy, I think an adult would get so much more from it. The use of Death as the story-teller gives a dimension that I can only sit in awe over. And what a beautiful, sensitive depiction of death it is! It is one of the very few books I will read again. Five stars aren't enough.
0060832819|5.0|Master storyteller Paulo Coelho's stories are all semi-autobiographical in nature, read well, are set in fascinating locations, and leave you thinking the author has somehow seen more deeply into the human spirit than most of us.  It's hard to read his books without feeling deeply touched, and The Zahir is no exception.<br /><br />There are themes of love, belonging, separation, anxiety, heartbreak, understanding, alienation, need, want.  Many settings, in many places including Paris, Madrid, Kazakstan.  The themes are ones that absorb all humankind whether we realize them or not.<br /><br />I read this book at a bad time in my life, pulling it randomly from my wife's bookshelf, and being pulled into the book as if it were somehow the correct choice of all the books I could have picked.  It spoke to me deeply of love and understanding, in a way that I think many couples, many who have loved or lost will instantly empathize with.  Following in the narrator's steps, we arrive where he does, gain wisdom as he does, and achieve enlightenment as he does.  And hopefully, find and regain true love that had been neglected, as he does.<br /><br />Coelho's native language is not English, yet none of his writing feels \\"translated\\" or stilted like happens to many foreign writings when they appear in English.<br /><br />It is as if the author has a special gift for storytelling that transcends individual languages, the the vast number of countries in which his books have been published seems to support that.<br /><br />Whether you are looking to be entertained by a lively tale, or are seeking solace and understanding as I was, The Zahir will fill your need.  If you are in need of both then it behooves you to read everything this master storyteller has written.
B000OONTFU|5.0|Excellent set. Worth the money, and worth the time to rewatch it (yes, even Revolutions is watchable now. Well, half of it, at least). Haven't experienced any glitches whatsoever, and judging from reports, they're fairly isolated incidents. This is not anywhere near the same scale as Good Shephard or Children of Men. The most worthwhile purchase for HD-DVD owners, whether this set or just the trilogy.
B00005JPOE|5.0|This is film is a rarity and a treasure.  Beautiful and a must see for everyone.

B000FS9FCQ|1.0|I can't believe that people actually like this move. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. The action is awful, the script is the worst writing the Wachowski Brothers have ever done since Bound. This one of the dumbest movies ever made. It seems that the Wachowski's movies are going farther and farther downhill as they try to match their only good movie; The Matrix. There are moments and lines and all sorts of other things in this film that are completely ripping off Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil. I think that movies should be entertaining and if they aren't that then they should be important, even movies that are bad I can still laugh at and get enjoyment out of. V for Vendetta is one of those rare movies that I got absolutely no entertainment out of, this is one of the only movies I can say I truly hate. Don't let the one star fool you, this is a zero star movie. The only messages I could get out of this were kill people and blow things up for freedom, rip off Brazil, don't hate gay people, and lesbians love wrists.
8489367116|5.0|I came to Shantaram through the recommendation of a friend after I expressed joy from reading Suketu Mehta's [[ASIN:0375703403 Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found]] - a thrilling non-fiction account of modern Bombay's underworld.<br /><br />Shantaram didn't disappoint.  Since it's a 900+ pager, I was engaged with it for several weeks.  It so deeply absorbed me I began to feel pangs of sorrow as I approached its end.  The universe this book creates was one of only a handful that this voracious reader was terribly saddened to leave at the book's conclusion.<br /><br />The book covers so many issues in loving detail: Bombay, Asia, the expatriate experience, poverty, crime, heroin addiction, love, betrayal, redemption.  I'd love to see Shantaram nominated as a \\"classic\\" and read by high school and college students instead of non-starters like Wuthering Heights and The Scarlet Letter.  Love learned and lost amongst poverty, crime and deception is love, nevertheless.<br /><br />I can't wait until the Mira Nair/Johnny Depp film version of the book is released in 2008(?)!
B000006CCG|5.0|Now, I'm not just giving this album the full five-star rating because I am a huge W.A.S.P. fan; but because I honestly believe this album deserves five stars!  This album stands for everything that metal believed in during the 1980's.  Pressured by the ever agressive PMRC, bands throughout the country were using them as a tool to gain more noteriety.  This is exactly what W.A.S.P. did for their debut album, and look where they are now! <br /> <br />1. Animal (F*ck Like a Beast) -  When I first heard this song (on a Vh1 special on the history of metal) I was instantly hooked.  This song is the absolute best way for a heavy shock-rock newly formed band like W.A.S.P. to debut.  The song actually gained more fame because it wasn't allowed to be put on the original album back in 1984.  Genius marketing ploy by the boys there.  Awesome song with just fun, raw lyrics and fun, raw energy! 5/5 <br /> <br />2. I Wanna Be Somebody -  The \\"first\\" single from the album.  Again just pure raw emotion by Blackie and the boys.  This is a song you can just rock to, and is also a song that gets you ready to conquor the world! 5/5 <br /> <br />3. L.O.V.E. Machine -  I first heard this song from the band Fozzy and their cover of it.  Finally getting to hear it from W.A.S.P. themselves, it is another good song.  Straight up rocking.  My only gripe is that the chorus itself can become a bit repetitive towards the end.  Good song nonetheless. 4/5 <br /> <br />4. The Flame -  This is another song that is just awesome!  It has a nice hook so listerners can sing along to it and not really dig into what the song may be about.  Catchy lyrics, and Chris Holmes does an amazing job on this track really separating himself from Blackie. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />5. B.A.D. -  The band really likes the use of periods within their music.  Again, this song keeps up the straight rocking vibe.  It will have you banging your head and pumping your fists in the air no matter where you are.  Awesome track. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. School Daze - This is, in my opinion, the weakest song on the album.  I understand that it is just a straight up rock anthem to kids suffering at the confines of school, but the song itself doesn't really go anywhere!  One good thing about it is Chris Holmes guitar playing which distracts the listener from the repetitive lyrics.  3/5 <br /> <br />7. Hellion -  This song took me a couple of listens to get into, but once I did I can honestly say it's not half bad.  Awesome guitar and bass playing, and the drum work continues toi be flawless. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />8. Sleeping (In The Fire) -  The first official \\"ballad\\" from the band, and the obligatory ballad to include on every album.  Shows a slightly softer side from the band and proves that they can do it.  The song does however maintain the hard edge that the band is known for and therefore this \\"ballad\\" really separates itself from other known ballads; and really the album as a whole. 4/5 <br /> <br />9. On Your Knees -  Jumping right back into the hard and heavy shock-rock, this song brings the album  back around to its original focus; non-stop rock!  May take time to appreciate, but is a good and fun song overall 3.5/5 <br /> <br />10. Tormentor -  This is a catchy song!  This all forms around the chorus in which Blackie screams with all his power!  Another track on the album that is just fun to rock out to. 4/5 <br /> <br />11. The Torture Never Stops -  This song in my mind, picks up right where \\"Tormentor\\" leaves off.  Awesome guitar and bass playing here; really ties the album together.  Sogn does have a slightly repetitive feel to it, but is catchy nonetheless. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />12. Show No Mercy [b-side] -  A bonus track here and a b-side at that.  Really stays with the overall theme of the album; showing that Blackie and the boys will \\"Show No Mercy\\" to anyone who may critisize them and their music.  Awesome song.  4/5 <br /> <br />13. Paint It Black [b-side] -  Another b-side, and a cover of aRolling Stones classic.  Although many covers tend to be a less formal an somewhat watered-down version of the original, W.A.S.P. does an amazing job here and shows they do belong within the elite group of metals very best! 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br />There you have it; the classic debut of W.A.S.P. one of the hardest most interesting bands in history.  They got the attention they needed for this album to become a success, and although Blackie is the only original member left... we can see how far the band has come since the shock-rock days.  A classic album that should be owned by all metal fans throughout the world.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great product filled with fantastic visuals and amazing narratives. If given the choice, go with this version of the set narrated by David Attenborough and not the Sigourney Weaver narration. It makes all the difference and the language change to Weaver's version is insulting in dialogue and monotoned in delivery. The editing of this series is fantastic and the content of the episodes flows from topic to topic keeping everything exciting and fresh. Well set up documentary and worth every penny. Highly recommended.
0385340559|5.0|I just finished the book and was sad that the moment of waiting for my next Reacher book was over and I had to turn this one over to my wife.<br /><br />I LOVED THE BOOK. I will not go into details except to give it five it 5 stars and wait for the next Reacher book. I have read them all and loved them all. I have spread them around to others to read and befome fans like we are at the Taylors. Our number one author, I had it on order for months, BUY IT and be thrilled. I read all the best thrillers as they come out. Jack Reacher is my Fantasy man if I ever needed help.<br /><br />Thanks Lee.
075640407X|2.0|I found this book to be very disappointing after all the hype I'd read. It's pretty much cookie cutter fantasy. Young orphan making his way in the world. Check. School of magic. Check. A girl. Check. A dragon. Check. *Ahem* Yawn.<br />It starts off pretty decently and then goes into a book long flashback that's mostly slow and tedious. (I'm sure the book would be about 50 pages shorter if the author skipped over all the meals described in detail.) There's not much action or adventure in the flashback coming of age story, and not much new to add to the world of fantasy. Better than Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan or Mercedes Lackey, but not up to par with Steven Erickson, James Barclay, Scott Lynch or George R.R. Martin.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band Of Brothers is the Best TV mini-series depiction of WWII ever made, plain and simple. The story based on Stephen Ambrose's book follows a single company of GI's through the battles fields of Europe. The men portrayed here are real people with merits and faults and the characterizations lend the film it's realism. The combat scenes are as well filmed as anything in a feature film.<br /><br />For WWII buffs, or anyone interested in history this is an indispensible box set to own. For those who had a father or a grandfather who served in Europe this is a fitting tribute. What a generation we're slowly losing !
B000PWQPAC|5.0|Solid State Society is hopefully a sign of what is to come in the world of Ghost in the Shell. After Stand Alone Complex's 2nd GIG, I was definitely left with a slightly bitter aftertaste. The pacing of the 2nd GIG felt uneven and the story felt more convoluted than tastefully complex, creating an adequate but not perfect addition to the GitS series. However, Solid State Society takes the best from the Stand Alone Complex series and in little under two hours presents a story as rich in detail and as lovingly complex as the series preceding it. <br /> <br />A huge plus of the movie is that instead of feeling like an overstretched episode, it feels more like a long arc of quality episodes stringed together while still feeling cinematic in its presentation. Solid State Society gives us everything we expect in a GitS story: a sci-fi universe that draws you in but never overwhelms, continuity in character development, rich and intelligent dialogue and plot that almost seems plausible down the road, and of course, some light philosophy and shades of grey. Even if you aren't an anime or a strict sci-fi fan, you might just enjoy this one.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|<br />The film is long, heavy and boring. For almost three hours, all the characters did was talking,  <br />talking and talking again. From what I know, movie came from the word \\"move\\". So, if all the actors and  <br />and actresses just moved their lips the whole time, it should be called a \\"play\\" not a movie!  <br /> <br />To understand the tension, and hardship of a spy, it's better to read a non-fiction book written by a real <br />spy such as \\"Spy Catcher\\" by Peter Wright. A book can describe pyschological and non-material matters <br />deeper than a movie.  <br />
B00005JPO8|5.0|This movie was a wonderful surprise. It had a very engaging story full of suspense and emotion, and still it was a movie that made you think. I also found it to be very realistic. I loved the ending. The ending was unexpected but happy, and at the same time very touching. Both my wife and I loved this movie which is something that does not happen that often.<br /><br />The director paid a lot of attention to details to make it look and feel like East Germany 1984. The colors, the look of buildings, the cars (trabant), and the way people spoke, the fear of saying the wrong thing, all that was captured in a very realistic manner. You could really feel the oppression and melancholy of Communist East Europe. It is therefore also a great educational movie.<br /><br />Even though I did not visit East Germany, I visited the Soviet Union and met with oppressed people there. I was myself held and interrogated at gun point by Soviet authorities (but not for long). However, I also had friends that visited East Germany and we talked about our experiences. Based on my experiences and that of my friends I think I can state that the director was able to capture the look and feel of an Eastern European country.<br /><br />In Soviet people were always watching what they were saying, they seemed depressed and the atmosphere was melancholic. Buildings, stores, and apartments were grayish looking, there were military personal with cool hats everywhere, and cars were small and came only in a few brands (Vaz, Lada, Volga). The movie does not dwell on severe persecution which also existed in both places; it is not what the movie is about.<br /><br />So in summary, the movie was wonderful and engaging, but also very realistic and believable.
0780624890|1.0|dont even bother, unless you're just in it for the fashion and score (some nice techno sounds).
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Amazing.  It's all new, but yet so familiar.  Megadeth stays true to itself yet again, and pounds out yet another classic.  A joy.
B000G0O5N2|3.0|I'm previewing the Blu-ray version of this film.<br /><br />Video: picture quality was slightly above average with some grain in dark parts opf the movie. In other part of the movie, the picture appeared really sharp and Hi-Definition-like. Overall quality was good, but not very consistent throughout the whole movie. I viewed this movie on Hi definition projector with 101\\" screen on the new Samsung BD-P1200.<br /><br />Audio: Slightly above average<br /><br />Finally, it's worth mentioning that the image froze only once, but still that seems to be a common and annoying problem with Blu-ray discs. Cleaning the BD with a microfiber cloth help sometimes, but it takes away the fun if you have to take out the BD and clean it, then put it back in the machine and wait for it to load and then you have to go to the selection menu and try to figure out where you were before the disc froze.
1400063515|3.0|The subject matter was very interesting, but the writing style was not easy or fluid.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I used to be a big linkin park fan. This cd is not good, the first single to come out \\"What I've done\\" is total phoney garbage. No melody or rythm....<br /><br />avoid this
B000OCXFCO|3.0|I am a pretty big fan of thrash, and megadeth of course. So when I heard this cd was released I rushed out and bought it. You know what? It's ok. Not good not great. The first song Sleepwalker is one of the best Deth songs ever created opening with a pretty clean guitar part before going into an amazing thrash song with careening tempos and rapid tempo changes (from fast to faster!) a catchy course and rapid fire back to back solos. Washington is Next is good has some good solos, and a catchy vocal hook and guitar part. After this though the album slips a bit. United Abominations and Gears of war are ok...but the album doesnt get going again until we hit Mustaine's remake of A Tout de Le Monde where he teams up with the female vocalist from Lacuna Coil to make a Good (gasp!) radio friendly song. The next few songs are ok, but not great. Conclusion; Some very good songs and some avg. sorta boring ones. Glen is a good guitarist though I still miss the melodic flair and brilliance of Marty Friedman's playing. Good, but if ur getting into these guys start with Killing is my buisiness, Peace Sells and Rust in Peace first...
B000O178BY|5.0|I'm diggin' Nine Inch Nails's latest release. It's original, it's fresh, and it ROCKS! <br /> <br />Take a listen- you won't be sorry.
B000P2A256|2.0|Vash, I couldn't agree with your review more. <br /> <br />There is a song on there that sounds just like Outkast's \\"Hey Ya\\", 2 or 3 other ones sound like something The Police would have done, very close to \\"Every Breath You Take\\", and another sounds very close to Three Doors Down.  Even the piano ballad that they did is very lackluster. <br /> <br />In terms of songwriting, it seems like they were still on this \\"You've done me wrong, but now I hate you, but can't get you out of my skin\\" stint. <br />Many of the same lyrics from Songs About Jane reappear on this CD, but with no sense of style. <br />I really enjoyed their first CD, and the Jazzy-Rock-Funk feel that it had.  The arrangement was well crafted, slick guitar solos, and most of the songs very catchy.  I was hard-pressed to find 1 or 2 decent guitar solos on their new CD. <br />I will sample all of the songs before I buy their next album of theirs. <br /> <br />Disappointed...
B000007MVM|3.0|Bought this because I am an enormous pink floyd fan and read reviews that, in this case, Madcap is a must have. I was disappointed in the CD overall mostly due to its more pop-oriented tracks that lack the variety of percussion and synthisizer that make the early floyd albums great. Octopus is a catchy tune, but most of the others fail to engage. As a whole: an interesting album, but lacks the creativity of any of the Floyd productions.
B00005JKGK|4.0|Definite chick flick.  One of the first really long films I fell in love with.  Get's a good cry from me.  I definitely feel like I can connect to the characters in this film.  Many of them are really nicely developed.  You can really feel the struggles of many of the daughters and the expectations the family has for them.
B00004RD54|4.0|Took the advice of other reviewers to buy this as an intro to Lou Reed. The guitar work on this album is simply amazing. Every track features some excellent loud engaging jams. I was disappointed, however, in the lyrics for the album. Reed seemed to lack energy on most of the tracks (could be partially due to his style) especially in 'Rock and Roll' I felt the studio versions would be much better lyrically, but as far as the overall performance of the band, I thought this CD was superb.
0743454537|2.0|It is interesting that so many book clubs have chosen this book.  It is also interesting to read the differences between the 1 and 2 star reviews and those that give this a 4 or a 5.  There were some things that I really liked about this book, however, I am only able to give this book a 2 star review.  My basic feeling is that this is a summer beach or poolside read and I would never choose this for my own book club because, frankly, it was just too dumb. <br /> <br />The storyline was the lure.  It was fascinating and full of all kinds of possibilities for a more serious and less mainstream/bestseller writer.  This was the first (and probably last) book I've read by Picoult and I can say that I don't think I've ever read a book by a more pretentious and self-aware writer, though Dan Brown comes close.  I think that Picoult tells WAY too much (things like irony, for example, should be discovered by the reader), and includes too many meaningless details and anecdotes which I felt she may have put in because she thought they were profound, but they only came off as hokey and contrived.  It seemed almost as if she tried to stuff every good creative thought she'd had while writing this novel into it.  The dialogue was inane, and the gratuitous love story between Campbell and Julie was the melodramatic stuff of afternoon soaps.  The alternating point of view (and FONT!!) only served to annoy me and continue to reveal way too much about what everyone was thinking, though stylistically every character sounded the same.  Much of the book, I feel, would probably appeal to the younger (high school) reader and, mostly, I just felt it was below my critical reading level and interest. <br /> <br />The ending?  Well, many of the reviewers on Amazon have cried over this ending because they think it was a cop out and skirts the real issues.  But, I think it suits this silly, fluffy novel just perfectly.  I got so tired of Picoult's writing style that I couldn't bear to do anythingbut scan the last 75 or so pages for the \\"unexpected\\" twist.  The only thing that makes the ending even more ridiculous are the so-called \\"discussion\\" questions which follow the pat ending.  Mercy!  When you don't leave anything to be discovered by your readers, how can you possibly think we'd have anything to discuss??!? And, can someone take away Jodi Picoult's thesaurus already?!   <br /> <br />My guess is that Jodi Picoult can actually write.  What I've read here, however, is trite, fluffy stuff for people who haven't read the selections of those who are a little more discriminating.  Perhaps all her books are this way, I don't know.  I would love to see what someone like Joyce Carol Oates would do with this topic. <br /> <br />I came to this book after reading the stunning, sexy, and absolutely terrific book, The Lady and the Unicorn, by Tracy Chevalier.  Oddly, the alternating point of view in this book worked wonderfully.
1400063515|1.0|I agree with other reviews that this is a poor follow on to \\"Fooled by Randomness.\\" I've found myself skipping sections and not missing anything.  <br /> <br />Mostly this book is soaked with the author's extreme arrogance. And it is nothing more than listening to a babbling know-it-all. The type of guy that you get stuck talking to at a party until you start praying for a fire alarm. <br /> <br />As a scientist, I don't agree with the notion that an outlier event disproves a hypothesis or central tendency statistics. It merely proves that outliers exist and mathematical models are attempts to predict and are often flawed. Duh, we already knew that. <br /> <br />Further, the whole notion that no one could have predicted the internet or Google is absurd. We've seen them grow--and participated in that growth. How is that improbable and unpredictable?  <br /> <br />The book is mildly engaging at times, and apparently I'm one of the few that disliked it. Maybe my PhD made me too dumb to understand.
0440241413|5.0|i could not put this book down, it is great!! i just love the character of rebecca, but sometimes i want to kick her, she is crazy!! i am looking forward to read the other shopaholic series!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I just love owning this series!  Not only do you get all the shows, but you get an extra DVD with more about the making of BoB.  The series was excellent and being able to watch as much as I want is wonderful.  I even purchased my older son his own set.
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|I bought this DVD with no hesitation because it was \\"unrated\\".  All the reviews I read were very positive and therefore I was taken by surprise by a scene in the flashback after the aborted wedding.  There is a scene depicting sexual intercourse between Mr. Rochester's first wife and another man.  It is not a big scene but totally unnecessary and not true to a Charlotte Bronte novel.  This will not be included in my library as I only have classics...movies that can be viewed for years to come and be enjoyed by all ages.  I regret that this movie is unrated....what good is a rating system if it does not rate a movie that has a depiction of sexual intercourse. So families beware!
0307155102|5.0|My children each received one of these books when they were little.  I would sit with them and go over the pictures in some of the groupings I knew they could relate to, especially \\"the bear's new day.\\"  When our daughter was 5 or so, she started to teach herself to read using the pictures in this book as a starter.  Now that all of my children are grown and have babies of their own, I have bought this book for our grandchildren.  The illustrations are clever and sure to please most pre-schoolers as well as the people who read to them.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|This CD is a bit different for Buble.  He has inserted a few of his songs. Three to be exact. The rest of the CD is great orchestrations and of course the magic of Buble. If you're a fan you will enjoy the CD.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|[[ASIN:B000M5AJQS The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] <br />   <br /> <br />When I checked item out initially I was under the impression it was in a tin box with photo cards as specified, it was a special edition this was false but of a different kind to the delivery, but overall am still happy with the goods and the speed of delivery was excellent
0895260131|5.0|Read this book...then check out the Qur'an and Hadith yourself. Don't take Spencer's word for it...check it out.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This is not merely one great rock documentary -- it is one of the finest pieces of documentary filmmaking I have ever seen.  The directors and cinematographer have truly captured the wildness, the drugs, the sense of abandon, hope, mystery, fear, violence, and joy -- all of it wrapped in a remarkable rock music event marred by the Hells Angels' tragic violence.<br /><br />The sense of foreboding as the filmmakers capture the haphazard planning for this free Altamont concert is palpable -- I love the way the Stones' lawyer, Melvin Belli (wearing a very wide tie), attempts to negotiate a last minute concert site.  There are so many impossible to forget images -- the Stones' listening to a play back of \\"Wild Horses\\" at Muscle Shoals studio; the stoned-out kids moving from amazement to horror as the violence unfolds; the boys listening to Sonny Barger call in to a radio station and justify the violence because the fans were \\"messing with our bikes.\\"<br /><br />There is great onstage concert footage too -- the Flying Burrito Brothers kick it off in fine fashion, then Tina Turner turns in a sexy performance, practically deep-throating the microphone, but by the time Jefferson Airplane gets on stage you just know something is about to go very, very wrong.<br /><br />As the violence unfolds, to the onstage antics of \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" things get very weird.  Mick, onstage, calling for cool.  Fans crying, mouthing to Mick \\"why?\\" silently, Keith and the boys still riffing as the beatings mount -- all captured brilliantly by the filmmakers.<br /><br />The final piece -- Mick and the boys watching the concert footage in the studio -- is equally priceless and equally revealing.<br /><br />Bravuro filmmaking!
0393327655|5.0|Harris', at sometimes, comic critique of \\"faith\\" and \\"belief\\" is undeniably on cue, which is probably why his detractors are trying so fervently to plug the gaps of exposed absurdity. Take this example to be the representative par excellence of \\"The End of Faith\\": \\"To be ruled by ideas for which you have no evidence (and which therefore cannot be justified in conversation with other human beings) is generally a sign that something is seriously wrong with your mind. Clearly there is sanity in numbers. And yet, it is merely an accident of history that it is considered normal in our society to believe that the Creator of the universe can hear your thoughts, while it is demonstrative of mental illness to believe that he is communicating with you by having the rain tap in Morse code on your bedroom window.\\" <br />Elegantly written and \\"simple\\" enough for even a religious person to understand, Harris hits it out of the park with this one.
B000P2A256|1.0|The only reason I gave this CD 1 star is because I can't give it a lower raiting.  I became a real fan after \\"Sougs About Jane\\".  That could be the most complete album I have ever heard.  It was creative, distinct and memorable.  This CD is tripe.  After waiting for 5 years I am very dissapointed, to say the least.  Another one hit wonder who will quickly fade.
0743289684|5.0|This is a compelling look at a culture and religion that most of us know very little or nothing about. I'm very glad that Ms. Ali wrote this book and had the courage to stand up to her opponents (surviving death threats and the death of a friend) to stay what needs to be said. Women are still suffering at the hands of radical patriarchal societies/cultures. They are treated with indignity and as subhumans - never mind the abhorrent mutilation practices in some cultures. And societies as a whole are also suffering under such a negative cloud - a master/slave relationship with their god and their own people. It has shed a great light onto the problems in the Middle East and radical Islam for me. I'm hoping that everyone gets the opportunity to read this book and form their own opinions. All I can say is be prepared. The press isn't telling us the whole truth about current state of affairs.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I saw this fantastic love story in theater and is made it perfect as the book. Which I also recomend. A must see the flesh and the sadness in the smell of beauty. This movie is a master piece!!! Mas<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0004Z32NI Sex and Lucia (Unrated Edition)]]
B000OCXFCO|1.0|This album is the best produced disaster I've heard.  What is -everyone- smoking?  This album isn't even -heavy-!  Just because you hear a few Rust stylings doesn't mean it rocks.  If you heard this from another band, you'd call it what it is, a pathetic attempt at mass metal.<br /><br />These aren't SONGS people.  When you hear them played live, will you be doing anything other than standing around with your hands in your pockets?  Will you ever sing along?  Which track are you sending to your buddy, saying you HAVE to check this out?  NONE of them.  Only one track is staying on my ipod, Washington Is Next - maybe Burnt Ice.  The rest I delight in erasing (well, if I hadn't paid xx bucks for it).<br /><br />Seriously, Cryptic Writings and Risk sound interesting next to this.  Just proves that TSHF was just a blip on Dave's downwardly spiralling radar, 4 crap albums out of the last 5.<br /><br />Do NOT buy the hype - that's all this album is.  Everyone's so desperate for a Rust repeat, Dave included, that we're willing to poke at its corpse fifteen years later.  I'm just as pathetic.  But never again.<br /><br />GARBAGE.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Absolutely incredible.  I found myself spending an entire Saturday glued to this amazing set of DVD's.  As a self proclaimed Docu-Junkie, I found the footage exquisite.  The unique camera angles and creative editing were the best I've ever seen.  In addition, having watched the series on Discovery, I found the narration (Sir David Attenborough)in the BBC version to be far superior.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|When I saw CHILDREN OF MEN in the theatre, I was blown away. While it loses a bit of its impact moving from the big screen to the small, it's still a powerful film. There are a number of reasons why I like this movie:<br /><br />The concept of a future devoid of children is interesting and I find how it's played out in the film intriguing.<br /><br />It's an edge-of-your-seat thriller/action movie.<br /><br />Like much of the best of speculative fiction, it's able to make statements about problems we're encountering today but isn't preachy. And the action is played out over the social commentary so you can just watch it as an action movie or something more.<br /><br />O my gosh, is it filmed beautifully! It is simply stunning to watch. I notice new details in the background each time I watch it.<br /><br />It's very well cast.<br /><br />On the DVD itself, the sound is stunning. The special features are OK, with the best being the behind-the-scenes featurettes.<br /><br />All in all, this is a DVD well worth your time.
B00005JPCF|4.0|I find it very odd that so many people disapproved of this movie. I thought it was very entertaining! The music (while the interpretations of classic songs were sometimes a bit strange) was spectacular, the characters were believable enough, and the overall storyline will touch your heart and leave you with the urge to march over to the UN and slap some sense into them :)  <br />~I felt that the environmental message tied in well with the \\"Let's all shun Mumble because he's different\\" theme (the penguin elders think that Mumble's dancing has angered the penguin goddess, causing their nation to stumble into devastating famine, though the cause lies with the humans who have been taking all of the fish). I felt that the environmental bit gave the movie a bit more conflict and depth than if it was just another retelling of The Trumpet of the Swan. <br />~I think that a lot of people who saw this movie were expecting too much. It didn't really surprise me that much when the characters were given \\"people\\" personalties and they still did penguin things (I mean, they are still penguins, after all), but it did seem to put off many of my fellow reviewers.  <br />~And personally, I didn't really find any of the \\"explit sexual content\\" in the songs very offensive. Love, not lust, was central to the movie's theme, and I don't think that children (I being a lot closer to a child's age than many of the other reviewers are) would give it much notice. <br />~Finally, regarding the \\"scary\\" scenes in the movie with the sea lion and the killer whales, I think I saw scarier things in Ice Age 2. I mean, these parts barely lasted 10 minutes collectively! Not much material for criticism there, I think. Unless you are really petty, that is ;)  <br /> <br />Well, I could say more, but I just hope that anyone who buys this movie finds it as hilarious, thought-provoking, and essentially satisfying as I did! It's not nearly as bad as some other reviews may say, in my opinion.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This is a nice package for a film such as this.  My only wish, is that it would contain more interviews with Frank Miller and how he brought Sin City to life as a comic book.  But other than that, there's a nice selection of interesting features on how they made this fantastic film.  Plus, this DVD contains a complete copy of The Hard Goodbye, which is one of the original graphic novels.  It's fun DVD to have.  I hope you like it!
B00005JLEU|3.0|Sprited Away is an impressive movie.  It has a coherent plot, a well-developed main character, and supurb animation.    It definitely succeeds as a story about a modern girl who winds up as a bathhouse attendant for kami, and has to grow up fast in order to deal with the bizarre situations you'd expect in such a place.    However, I think I liked the concept better than the execution.  The idea of an abandoned theme park taken over by kami is really inspired, as is the kami commuter train, where the tracks and stations are all partly covered by water.    For me, the eerie situation and atmosphere kept getting buried by the action and dialogue, which often seemed random and pointless.  Slimy blubbery things with tentacles show up, puke lots of slime, eat other slimy creatures, puke them up, and everyone screams a lot.    For some reason (too much H.P. Lovecraft?) nearly all kami in Miyazaki movies are kind of shapeless and blubbery, and spew slime and tentacles everywhere at the slightest provocation.    More importantly, none of the kami are developed enough as characters for the viewer to get much insight into their motivations.  Yubaba/Zenziba can switch from being manipulative or murderous soul-stealers to kindly grandmothers in the blink of an eye, and like the rest of the cast, always seem to push Chihiro in the direction she needs to go to finish the story.  I had the frustrating impression that the whole story simply existed for the sake of Chihiro's psychological growth.  That may well be the director's intention, but certainly makes for a less interesting movie.
B000O178BY|5.0|I'm not sure what's been said or what hasn't been said, but as a long-time listener of NIN (since 1993), I have to say that I didn't really dig on the past few albums, but Year Zero is definitely one of Trent's best efforts. Think of it as a more modern-day version of Pretty Hate Machine, combined with the darker elements and sounds that made The Downward Spiral such a master-piece.<br /><br />So far my favorite track is Me, I'm Not, but the more I listen to the disc the more all the tunes grow on me. Right now I am listening to The Great Destroyer, and I have to say this track is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Of course there are the singles Capital G and Survivalism which are great tracks in their own right (I really enjoy the lyrical visuals of Survivalism).<br /><br />Buy this now if you were ever a fan of Trent's earlier stuff.
1594489505|5.0|Another excellent book by Dr. Hosseini, indeed.  The world should thank this man for bringing it beautiful visuals of what his birth country once was but more importantly, what it can be again.  He has told a heart wrenching story of what its people, particularly women, have had to endure under different but equally oppressive regimes.  I picked this book up last night at 10:30 pm and knocked it out by 4:45 am - it is just that engaging.  No doubt that both my intermittent sobs of sorrow and joy has my poor sleep-deprived husband a little annoyed with me today.  Just as with The Kite Runner, it was impossible to put this book down and I highly recommend it!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale is one of the very best of the whole Bond series. They decided to cut back on the gadgetry as we have seen in the last several of the series. Considering this is the 1st part of his \\"00\\" career, it shows you the lessons he had to learn in the business. Great mix of action scenes and love story, neither side too overdone or \\"too long\\". <br /> <br />Daniel Craig was phenominal as Bond. On a 1st impression, he jumps right into the mix of \\"best Bond ever\\" argument. Personally, I thought Brosnan might have edged out Connery, but many have their view of Connery being the best, because he was the 1st. Craig shows you his skill as an actor, both as the cold, heartless assassin as well as a vulnerable man when a woman grabs his(heart) and makes him remember he has one.
B00004SCX6|5.0|...for those too scared to attempt to like or praise Britney for her career. This review is for you.<br /><br />If you allow yourself for one second to transcend the stereotype of manufactured music, this album will tantilize your ears. On this album, Britney does what she does best--give you booty shaking tracks, proclamations of looking for love, and gilr power anthems. but, isn't that what pop is all about.<br /><br />She never claims to be the next Diana Ross. hell, she doesn't even pretend to belt it out like Christina Aguilera. On this album, like the title suggests, she does it again. However, there's no mistake about it. And, again, allowing yourself to take pop with a grain of salt and realize it fgor wehat it is, you can actually enjoy the tracks.<br /><br />Some of my fave include: \\"Can't Make You Love Me,\\" \\"Don't Go Knock My Door,\\" and \\"Stronger.\\" All songs which perpetuate that pop music at that time was all about asserting what it meant to be a teenaged girl--fun, fearless, and cool.<br /><br />So, alas, those of you who use her cuyrrent state of affaris to bash her entire career. It wasn't always so marred and shameful. She was, at one time, on topo of her game. And this album proves it!

B000O75F7C|5.0|Sadly, this album probably won't be the album that breaks Porcupine Tree into the mainstream.  Perhaps if it was it would mean the end for Porcupine Tree.  This album, unlike Deadwing had a large amount of hype and anticipation growing towards its release.  Having played a rough set of these songs live in a few cities, people got a glimpse of what was to be Fear of a Blank Planet.   <br /> <br />Slowly details dropped to Porcupine Tree fans, including the information that Porcupine Tree was indeed going to move away from the shorter tracks, including an epic 17 minute song.  Initial pre-release reviews were strong, if not invincible.  Snippets became available online.  All signs pointed to greatness. <br /> <br />Fear of a Blank Planet delivered!  From the beginning guitar riff that opens Fear of a Blank Planet to the apocalyptic ending, the listener is going to be treated to the \\"sound\\" that is Porcupine Tree.  There is no weak link to the album, a trait that fans have started to become accustomed to with Porcupine Tree.  Fear of a Blank Planet opens with the self title track, a slowly graduating riff that grows and Wilson rifles off an atypically large amount of lyrics.  Wilson isn't an optimist.  He sees a world of suffering.  He notes this to nearly a point of \\"Yeah we get it already... world sucks for kids.\\"  The opening song is full of pain and frustration within the riffs.  Then, in typical Steven Wilson fashion, the song then falls quiet in searching.   <br /> <br />Follows is a song which may be regarded as one of the best on the album, My Ashes.  A mellow song of yearning, hoping, complaining... doomed of course.  Porcupine Tree magnifies this song with orchestra and strings, adding an additional, and well utilized, landscaping to the song.  Vocals on the song, as usual, match the spirit of the song. <br /> <br />The epic Anesthetize is a remarkable achievement.  A 17 minute track that keeps your attention all the way through.  While Porcupine Tree had a few long tracks on albums like The Sky Moves Sideways, nothing they've done in epic length songs comes close to what they accomplish with Anesthetize.  There older long songs sometimes become trapped in lulls (which isn't bad if that is the sort of music you want to hear), there are no lulls in this song.  The best way to explain it is a 17 minute long Arriving Somewhere But Not Here from the Deadwing album, but in a Yes like Close to the Edge form.  You won't just be listening to the song, but you'll be highly anticipating the amazing lead guitar and bass riffs.  The song opens slowly with the ignored plea of a child.  It then transitions into an Alex Lifeson solo.  Once that is complete, the song picks up the pace.  Some will note that this is where the heavy metal sort of riff enters the song.  My liking of such a presence isn't too high, but the use is more to offset lulls in the music too.  These transitions aren't common on this album and if one doesn't like heavy metal, they shouldn't be put off by it's short lived presence in this song.  The song then transitions into a supremely great and catchy bass riff, entering back into lyrics.  The ending of the song ends in much the same way the opening track does, but you'll welcome it.  It is a very strong track... a track that will keep the mainstream from embracing the album, but this track is why you'll love the band.  Strong riffs, keyboards, awesome drums.   <br /> <br />After such a high I think the band knew the listener would need a break, hence Sentimental, an interesting diddy about the kids learning they need to grow up.  Much more mellow, keyboard driven song.   <br /> <br />The pace picks up again with Way out of Here when Robert Fripp makes an appearance.  The song's mood is soft and burrows into a dark mood for the remainder.  There is again a dark metal sound that exists in this song, though it is contrasted by a softer subtle riff by Fripp, which also rounds out the song, as it fades out in the lastminute.   <br /> <br />Sleep Together rounds out the album.  Suicide becomes the solution... it's Steven Wilson not Pete Townsend, after all.  Instead of seeing the better side of life in the end, the only way out is death.  This is represented by a dark shady landscaped song that ends the album.  The song begins with a odd synthesizer riff and drums.  Wilson's lyrics cut into the chorus almost as harshly as the conclusion that is this song.   <br /> <br />The album works very well as a whole and as individual pieces.  It became everything that I think Porcupine Tree fans would hope it would be.  Another fresh album that isn't exactly relying on past glory, but instead creates its own.
0684833395|1.0|I know... it's just me (it's always just me), but please take heed, and special notice that \\"Catch 22\\" is written in the form of a diary.  Just as \\"Dracula\\" is.  It seems most people don't mind the diary style, but I can't get over it.  It's as though I'm reading someone else's letters, and it doesn't engage me at all.  Take that for what it's worth.  I can't get through \\"Dracula\\" either and that's just as highly praised, if not more so than \\"Catch 22\\".<br /><br />This is a public service announcement from a reader who cares.

B000NVIXDW|4.0|This CD pales in comparison to his last CD. I was hoping for more of his own material but this isn't the CD - at least not yet. Otherwise, it's all Michael and if you're a fan, you'll still enjoy his sound.

B000001GBJ|3.0|Not quite what I had expected. A CD of violin with violins and some piano and yet another violin. Which, for some maybe just what you want.

038533348X|5.0|\\"Cat's cradle\\" is written in very Vonnegut style, in the midst of fiction and realism. The book starts describing the narrator's intention of writing a book about what important Americans did on the day Hiroshima was bombed with major attention on the \\"father of atomic bomb\\" fictional Nobel laureate physicist Felix Hoenikker. During his research the narrator gets acquainted with the scientist's childern though several letters, and finally ends up in the plane with them flying to an island where Frank Hoenikker suppose to become the next president. <br /> <br />Bokononism as a new religion defined by Vonnegut, created in the fictional island of San Lorenzo, one of the poorest countries in the world that was yield by each government to the next without any resistance during last several centuries. None of the islanders cares about anything except fishing, bokonizm and sex (defined as \\"boko-maru\\" in unpublished Bokonist books). All the intrigues are about a powerful material called Ice-9, the last discovery of great scientist, the only existing piece of which was shared among his children. <br /> <br />Narrator fells in love with beautiful Mona, who as well as all other native Bokonists make suiside by Bokonon's order. At the end he appears alone with four Americans on San Lorenzo as a \\"new Robinson family\\" and finally meets Bokonon, the creator of Boknist religion. The book leave reader guessing what will happen next and is absurd and fantastic. <br />

B000E1MTZE|5.0|I've had this set for a couple days now and have watched all three films. The picture quality is outstanding and the sound is too (though I thought the SD soundtrack was amazing too, not a discriminating ear). There are so many things I never really noticed in the original SD DVD releases. For instance in the second film when Morpheus is giving his speach at Zion. In the HD version you can see him spitting when he talks. I saw a parody of this scene at the MTV movie awards that year and didn't get it. I guess you had to of seen it at the theater.<br /><br />Some other things is the skin imperfections some of the actors have. I don't care about that sort of thing, but thought it was really cool to see people the way they really are. Also, I think HD and BR are going to change the way makup is applied for films. You can definately see some lipstick and blush on the male actors in a couple scenes. To make a long review shorter, buy the Matrix in High Definition. Even if you have BR it's a matter of time before it's released there too. Pick it up! Don't let this become a format issue, review the quality of the movie. It's a big enough market for mulitple formats these days.<br /><br />PS. This cheaper set comes with a free download of the Animatrix. So unless you want 10 hours of extras go with this cheaper set. Me, all I care about are the movies. I have the Lord of the Rings collectors sets and have never placed a bonus disc in my DVD player. Not the case for everyone.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Listening to metal in the 2000's has been a chore; most everything was amazingly average or had been done a lot better before.  Take it from me; Machinehead was one of these fairly average bands.  There was nu metal leanings, cookie cutters songs, and it took the band about 10 years to get some of their main fanbase back. <br />      <br />Well, it's official; the arrival of the blackening changes everything.  If you haven't heard this cd you might still be one of the one's in denial that machinehead has not only returned to full form but has taken on a masterpiece that exceeds the template of their entire career.  This cd is brutal.  Best thrash/death riffs I've ever heard out of machinehead; but with the range of dynamics, melody, and changing vocal styles to pull us through the catacylsm without getting burned by one set pace through out.   <br />       <br />The first track out of the gates, clenching the fists of dissent, nailed me to the floor.  Massive drumming, the choruses we know and love, and the guitars might as well be described as machineguns.  The two minute fade to one brual riff entertwined with breakdowns at the end of the track will be hard to forget, and harkens back to the days of davidian; machinehead's most well known track.  The blackening continues its rampage to hell and back; the song halo especially caught me off guard; a strong melodic chorus finds itself matched with the album's crowning riff.   <br />        <br />I have to say........don't leave this one on the mantle; if you enjoy metal this one is for you.
1401302378|3.0|In traditional stores, the cost of displaying an item depends on the rental versus the amount of space the item takes up. Stores can only afford to stock up on goods that move fast. Everything else is a liability. In the past, hits perform many times better on the market than the majority of products.<br /><br />Today, with the power of online retail, marketing and distribution, the distinction between what is a hit and what isn't has been blurred. With this new way of selling, even \\"obscure\\" niche products may get noticed and sell as well as hit material. This concept started even before online stores existed. Mail order allowed a far larger inventory of products to reach the customer than a traditional store with limited space for showcasing products.<br /><br />This book tells us, very neatly and scientifically, what most of us who were in business during the dotcom boom already knew. Sure, it's nice to have someone put all the ideas together so eloquently, but there are far too many examples, too much repetition, making the book unnecessarily long-winded (no pun intended).<br /><br />Everthing in the book could probably be summed up in a 2500-word article.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385520808 The Cult of the Amateur: How Today's Internet is Killing Our Culture]]
B000OCXMAE|1.0|All I can say is WTF???  How could these guys actually think about releasing this stuff. It is awful! Every song is dull, slow and boring, with the exception of the tracks, \\"What I've Done,\\" and \\"Given Up.\\" If they would've stuck to the formula of those 2 songs and of there last two albums, which are full of hard driving rockers and crunching guitar, then they would have a winner on there hands. But no, this album is a BIG FAT LOSER!!!! If you want to listen to some music that will put you to sleep, this is the album for you! But if you want to hear some good rocking tunes, look to there previous albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. You won't find it here. This is probably the worst rock album of 2007.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|After reading and watching the Great Gatsby in my English class I would have to say that I enjoyed the novel much more than the movie. I think that in the movie version they changed too many things that were important to the story. But overall I think that the director Jack Clayton did a fairly good job. I would have to disagree with many people on these reviews that said that they did a poor job casting.  I think that Robert Redford did a phenomenal job as Jay Gatsby as well as Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway.  I enjoyed the movie because it really helped me to clarify the time, mood, and setting in which the novel takes place.  The Great Gatsby is a story of love, the \\"American Dream\\", and life in 20's. I suggest that you read the novel if you truly want to capture the essence of story as well as \\"Roaring Twenties\\".
0060775858|4.0|This is an outstanding book that has a magical quality of quieting the busy mind and touching the spirit.

B000P2A256|4.0|I am in that group of reviewers who was not really a fan of this group before I heard this CD. Though there were some good songs in the past.. I would never have called myself a fan. What got me onto this CD was the video for their 1st single \\"Makes Me Wonder\\". I liked the song and decided to check out the album. I am glad I did. The album is very well written. Now I have read other reviews where there were issues and all that going into the production of this CD.. but really.. who cares about that stuff.. what matters is the finished product right? And the finished product here is really great music. There are a few songs on this CD that I have listened to a few times, and they have stuck with me, so I am humming them, or singing them in the car... Songs like \\"Not Falling Apart\\" which is loaded with hooks, and Kiwi.. which seems to be 2 different songs combined into one: 1 part Pop 1 part Rock. If I Never See Your Face Again has hit written all over it.  This CD is one of those ones that you listen to and don't expect it to be as good as it is. I highly recommend it.

As a teacher and parent it is inspiring me with new ways to approach the inevitable times when kids don't want to try anymore and to understand the ones who give up so easily.  <br />It sets a whole new context for learning and gives practical ideas. It is very well written and makes abundant sense. Highly recommended for all educators, parents and although a dedicated lifelong learner myself has inspired me to take on things I may have thought were beyond me.

I would actually go as far as to say that this is one of the best books I've ever read.  It is worth a read.  I would reccomend this book to anyone.

The acting is excellent and the ages of the actors is very close to the ages of the characters. This is a teenage movie for adults. It has its crazy moments, but in the end it's a love story. <br /> <br />I'm glad that it didn't do well at the box office. If it did, a sequel would been made.

B000FA57US|2.0|After a fairly good entry in the series, we come to 'Halloween 5 The Revenge Of Michael Myers'! This is probably the worst in the series right behind part 6. There are just too many plot holes and the whole thing feels really contrived(even for this type of film!). The sequels don't compare to the original and this one is really confusing and boring at times! It still delivers some shock value here and there, but nothing we haven't seen before. The film transfer is very good though and if your a fan of the series.......
B0000691U1|3.0|3 1/2 <br /> <br />I must side with a tiny minority in judging this album of three jazz giants as overrated, though certainly not grossly. The album seems to find these players manipulating traditional forms moreso then arranging new ones.  Anybody steeped in the genre would probably never allow this one out of their collection (Ellington fans in particular are treated to a rare and unhinged treat), but the combined strained effort does not add up to the masterpiece one would expect from these worthy musicians. Spending the majority of time between over-cooked experimentation and auto-piloted bop, rarely does the music flow as it seemingly should; forget about any intra-band tensions or any of that esoteric nonsense, an abundance of showy overplaying and jarring, ego-centric competition robs Money Jungle of much true musical tension. It does sometimes feel that bass work from the exceptional though difficult Charlie Mingus intentionally goes out of it's way to further smear any cohesiveness between the trio. As underwhelming as it's pedigree may suggest, the album still maintains a level of technical proficiency that cannot be denied from an objective standpoint, playing out like a good, but not great, avant garde-meets-traditional Jazz work from the early 60's.

1400063515|5.0|Taleb is brilliant, funny and an intentional provocateur with this essay that will both annoy and challenge the conventional wisdom about, well, wisdom.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Well boy howdy; I finally got around to viewing \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". During the early part of it, I thought it a bit slow and began to wonder if it wasn't past my bedtime. At the same time however, I thought the cinematography was stunning; making me wish I was in a proper cinema (as opposed to seeing it on my 20\\" screen).<br /><br />Gradually I opened up to the story and the way it was presented, and lo and behold, by the end of the film I felt it worthy of the praise it has received. And in retrospect, I believe that it HAD to be revealed just as it was, in that somewhat plodding cowboy style. Kind of made me think of \\"A Prairie Home Companion\\"'s characters Dusty & Lefty from *The Lives of the Cowboys* (couldn't help myself; if you're a PHC listener, you'll know what I mean).<br /><br />Sometimes I was frustrated by the behavior of the two lead characters, but that doesn't diminish the quality of the movie. For example, I wanted to suggest (before their subsequent marriages), that Jack & Ennis just DITCH that cowboy life and head for San Francisco or NYC or some other place more congenial to their relationship. But alas, there were other things to be considered as well; not the least of which would be the backgrounds and limited education (and hence opportunity) for these two, especially Ennis with his taciturn manner.<br /><br />But my point is that in mulling over the possibilities, I took the characters of Jack & Ennis very seriously, as they were very convincingly portrayed by Gyllenhaal and Ledger. I forgot that Heath Ledger was Australian; he had that mumbly mealy-mouthed American cowboy bit down pat. And Ang Lee's direction turned my early-on yawns into rapt attention. Now I would like to watch the movie a second time (at least); something I seldom do. Please bear this in mind if you're tempted to give up on \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" halfway through, because you're \\"bored\\". By the way, the basis for this movie is a short story written for \\"The New Yorker\\" by Annie Proulx.<br /><br />Also I'd just like to mention that if a gay man in the U.S. West had limited opportunities in 1963, it seemed to me that women (gay OR straight) had even LESS to choose from (sigh). But that's a discussion for another day...just like to mention that if a gay man in the U.S. West had limited opportunities in 1963, it seemed to me that women (gay OR straight) had even LESS to choose from (sigh).

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I enjoy \\"nature\\" programming and view many programs like \\"Planet Earth.\\" This entire series contains the best, by which I mean most amazing photography I have ever seen.  The producers make great use of high tech photography to capture rare animals and common animals in ways never seen before. <br />This is family viewing at its finest.  By that I mean everyone who watches these programs will learn as well as be amazed.  Beyond any doubt in my mind, this series is the best ever produced.

B000002J0B|5.0|It always seemed to me this was the hope and fulfillment of the vegetative growth that would follow \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" (last song on the previous album).  This album itself, esp. the Rain Song, is about change, destruction, and renewal, and this whole album feels like Spring after a long winter.   <br /> <br />A must for Zep fans (as if they needed to be told), but definitely one of the most accessible for new fans to get into (but watch every single newbie skip over \\"The Crunge\\"...takes awhile to appreciate that song I guess.)
0743496728|5.0|This book kept my attention from beginning to end. It was a painfully accurate description of how bullying has and still can occur in schools, the unfortunate feelings of hopelessness by those who are bullied and the sense of perceived or hoped for \\"status\\" of those who do the bullying. The book is one to make you reflect about the actions we see or do ourselves, and to try to be more aware for our own children, of how we can be more alert to things around us. I always enjoy Ms. Picoult's books and have always found them ones that can provide a great deal of reflection about \\"if I were in this situation, how would I feel?\\" The characters are well-developed and interesting connections are made. The ending is surprising, yet necessary, to help gain a better understanding of the full complexity of the characters states of mind.

1594489505|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner, its story is so original and fresh, so human and wonderful - one of the best stories I've ever read.  I couldn't wait for the author's second book and finished it in one day.  It is an excellent book.  Different from the Kite Runner, but no less worthy of reading, this story is set entirely in Afghanistan and spans decades in the lives of two women and the country they live in.    For those not familiar with the culture, it is a great opportunity to learn; along with bringing to light all the differences, the author also shows that certain truths such as the power of love, parental and otherwise, and sacrifices of a mother, are universal.  For the Afghan community, those who had to flee their country, the story might be a little difficult, that's how real it is.  I recommend this book to everyone.....I just finished the Kite Runner this morning, for the second time. I wanted to read the two one after the other for fair comparison.  But my advice is don't try to compare just read and enjoy, both are time very well spent in their own right.  Enjoy!
074356619X|2.0|While I do believe in the power of positive thinking, <br />this CD was \\"too hokey\\" for me. I bought the unadbridged version, thinking there would be a few more informational tidbits that would be of interest, but I wasn't prepared for the whole process to be dragged out. The lead-in music and repetition on these disks can be painful. Never once, did I want to sit in my car to finish out a section. I made it thru 3 of the 4 disks and I have to say, I'm listening to the 4th disk just to finish off the series.  If there is an abridged version, I go with that, or borrow from your library.
B00000APLB|4.0|I seriously think many of the songs on this live Stones album are better than their studio versions.  In fact, 80% of these songs are better than the studio versions, in my opinion.    <br /> <br />Some people give Love You Live a low grade because they think the music lacks energy, excitement and the whole live experience.  In my opinion, that's not true.  There's PLENTY of rock and roll to be found here.  It might not have the same dirty/bluesy sound that the early Stones did, but it certainly contains the kind of excitement you'd expect from the worlds greatest rock and roll band.   <br /> <br />If you like live classic rock, and think the Stones are one of the best bands, you can't go wrong with this album.  You really can't.  The only complaint I can find is that the version of \\"Fingerprint Files\\" isn't quite as good as the version found on the It's Only Rock and Roll album (because this version doesn't sound funky to me).  Other than that, it's a completely good time.     <br /> <br />\\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" are drastically improved here, in terms of Mick's vocals and the REALLY rockin' guitar solos.  What an album!
0967175429|4.0|Vianna Stibal has revised and expanded two previous books (Go Up and Seek God & Go Up and Work With God) into this publication.  Belief Work, or ThetaHealing, is the modality Vianna used to cure her cancer.  Vianna instructs that Theta is a God-inspired journey discovering layers within in ourselves that block our ability to self-heal.  According to Vianna, ThetaHealing can be learned by all because it is a God-given right, an extension of the God within us. <br /> <br />Using examples and exercizes, ThetaHealing guides the reader through several scenerios.  The marvelous aspect of the healing process is witnessing God's miracles, first hand! <br /> <br />The conversant style used in the book makes it diffucult to read at times.  It could have used more proof reading prior to publication.

If you're an initiate in modern animation tools, you will learn where the animation concepts that your application uses (whether it's Animo, ToonBoom, KToon, Blender3D or Maya) came from -- and take better advantage of them. <br /> <br />The book is a treasure trove of animation experience and wisdom -- comprehensive principles, techniques and formulas all made accessible in a surprisingly entertaining read. This is \\"animation done right\\" taught right. Mr. Williams won't make you recite the Twelve Principles -- you'll UNDERSTAND them an think in terms of them by the time you've read through the book and practiced a bit. <br /> <br />Did you know there's more to life than just the simplistic keyframes/in-between dichotomy found in most software packages? That's right: there's measuring timing and spacing, there's contacts/extremes, ease-in/out or 'cushions' and passing positions, there's joint breaking and elongated tweening... well, you'll just have to read and learn, and then you'll know far better what to do with your tools.

B0000AUHQT|4.0|The movie version of the Great Gatsby was very similar to the book but better.  The movie had alot of the same quotes as the book did and allowed you to get a visual representation of what was going on.  My favorite character in the movie was definately Jordan Baker.  She was most like the Jordan Baker I imagined when reading the book and was cast perfectly for the movie.  She was showed how arrogant all of the people in their society were and definately broght the sense of how rich they were to the movie.  Nick was cast good too and he proved to be a good actor.  The movie is old but yet it seems as if you are watching a fairly new movie.  The scenes at Gatsby's parties are very good and really bring out the feelings of the times.  Overall, the movie is really worth seeing.  It is definately a lot better than the book.  If I were to change one thing, I would like to see mrytle be played by a different actress.  Other than that though, it was excellent.
1577314808|5.0|Every actor is taught to live in the moment.  I had heard about this concept for many years and felt I had a fairly firm grasp of concept.  However, Mr. Tolle makes the concept easy to understand and simple to present to others.  I find that one of the problems most people face in their daily lives is that they spend too much time and effort reliving their mistakes of the past and worrying about the future.  This book presents numerous suggestions to help people recognize the value of investing their efforts in extracting the full value from 'today'.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I can unerstand that some people don't get this film, even disliking it because they don't get it. There is a lot of double think out there but thanks to films like this one those who think like that will become fewer and fewer. I am a fan of this film or I should say I've been a fan of this film from the first time I saw it and that was for many reasons. For one the actors are british who I find to be born actors anyway, and the script was brilliant. It's like giving Bruce Lee a set of nuchucks and letting him go to town. Match that with great production values,cinematograpy,and humour just in the right places of this deadly serious subject which, if you are perspicacious enough, will see that every frame of this film is happening to us all right now keeping in mind they have to condense so much information into a film. It's like trying to compress all of president, or is he dictator now? Geroge W. Bush's lies down to a couple of hours. But they got it all in. The lying news media,the corrupt police, the child molesting bishop,the megalomaniac \\"leader\\" all played brilliantly as only the english can do. The only thing fantasy like about the film was the main charachter V. Unfortunately we don't have one of those as far as I know. But who knows? It might rub off and we can all become LIKE V and get our freedom back. That is the message. Do we live out our lives in quiet desperation content to sit in front of the [...] tube doing the same old thing day in and day out being told what to think and what to feel just because it's easier that way being a slave to an elite gang of crimminals posing as our saviours and gods. Or living without fear because to live without fear makes you free and to live free means to really be alive. One of my favourite films, but I do have a lot of them.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|I liked Buble's first CD, even though it was heavy on the Sinatra mimicry.  Well, this one is too, a bit (several of the orchestrations are complete rip-offs of Nelson Riddle's), but Buble is finally coming into his own as a singer.  I've always said he owes as much to Mel Torme as he does to Sinatra and he proves it here with his great cover of \\"I'm Comin' Home\\" (oddly backed by Boyz II Men).  But his best performances are reserved for two out-of-left-field covers, most notably his big-band treatment of Leonard Cohen's \\"I'm Your Man\\" and an exquisite bossa nova reinterpretation of Eric Clapton's heretofore-mediocre \\"You Look Wonderful Tonight.\\"  Buble and Brazilian treasure Ivan Lins turn it into a wonder of delicacy and beauty, and together their voices are otherworldly.  Truly wonderful.
B000OVLNII|5.0|This is an amazing book. It combines the lively chronological history of a vital period in American history with a splendid style which affords the reader accountability and honesty. Mr. Lincoln, his wife, his colleagues and his adversaries are brought to life in a manner which places the reader in that space of life which seems almost as today. The inevitable comparisons of Mr. Lincoln with other presidents leaves him at the very top. The detailed history adds to one's understanding of how we moved through that difficult period.
B000P2A256|5.0|I had a disease during the five-year gap between Maroon 5's debut album and the better than expected follow up, IT WON'T BE SOON BEFORE LONG.  The doctor diagnosed the disease as \\"Maroon 5 withdrawal\\" and I had to concur. Five years went by, but somehow me and all of my friends were still singing \\"This Love\\", like it had just been released as a single from an upcoming album as opposed to being a gem in pop-music history.  But five-years was worth the wait clearly after hearing Adam Levine tear through single \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" where he so convincingly sings \\"and it makes me wonder if I ever gave a f**k about you. It was then I knew that the band who had rose onto the charts and went on to go four times platinum were going to bring one of the years strongest releases.  That's exactly what IT WON'T BE SOON BEFORE LONG is - one of 2007's best that has Grammy written all over it from the great cover art all the way to the great final track \\"Back At Your Door\\".  Great production work and much improved vocals from front man Adam Levine make this the guilty pleasure not only for teen and tween girls, but also for the teen, tween + boys who can relate to Levine's sexual frustrations. And as hard as this is to say, I think that IT WON'T BE SOON BEFORE LONG might just be better than SONGS ABOUT JANE, the breakthrough that brought the band to the forefront of pop and even arguably URBAN music.<br /><br />\\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\" opens up the album, giving SONGS's opening number \\"Harder To Breathe\\" a run for it's money.  The 80's production with string ostinato, funky guitar work, and great vocals by Levine make \\"If I Never\\" one of Maroon 5's BEST ever. The production is certainly the best I've ever heard from the band.  \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" follows suit with it's 80s-driven pop sound materializing in perhaps the band's very best single. The songwriting is so much mature two tracks in and keeps up pace with the only slightly-less impressive \\"Little Of Your Time\\", which resurrects the \\"Harder To Breathe\\" sound from SONGS ABOUT JANE mixed with the urbanized-pop music of today.  The synthesizer sounds within \\"Little Of Your Time\\" make it all the more better. \\"Wake Up Call\\" becomes the fourth straight solid hit as Levine brags about having to kill a man dead for sleeping with his girl.  Corny? Maybe, but I love it and the guitars are as funky as they've ever been.  The hook is killer as well. Five years? Who cares at this point!!!<br /><br />\\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" sheds the urban flair the album has exhibited for more Sting- crafted style pop of which Maroon 5 does just as well as they did with the urban influence. Levine's vocals here sound pitch-perfect and the guitars are very sick.  Second single \\"Nothing Last Forever borrows from Levine's hip-hop collaboration with Kanye West (\\"Heard 'Em Say\\"), but instead crafts the song based upon the hook of that track into a pop track. It is perfect and may just be my favorite from IT WON'T BE SOON BEFORE LONG. \\"Can't Stop\\" revives a rock-pop driving feel that is infectious while \\"Goodnight, Goodnight\\" has a darker, power-pop feel that is nearly as effective as the very best of the album.  \\"Not Falling Apart\\" borrows another tip from Sting's work while \\"Kiwi\\" sounds like it would've been at home on a Justin Timberlake album.  \\"Better That We Break\\" truly exploits Levine's upper register to a tee while \\"Back At Your Door\\" seems an appropriate close to this exceptional pop album.<br /><br />I have no complaints and if it took five years to make this album, then I have no quibbles about that either.

B000MV9026|1.0|Usually fans of animated films, my wife and I were excited about seeing this award winning film.  We were quickly disappointed.  The movie tried to be too many things to too many people, and it ended up missing on nearly every front.  I find it strange that this movie was critically acclaimed, because problems I would expect critics to catch seemed to be everywhere. <br /> <br />First, thtere was the lack of a defined audience.  Animated penguins would seem to be for the youngsters.  However, sexually suggestive lyrics and themes that were advanced for even young teenagers seemed to suggest this was a movie for young adults.  Then again, anyone over the age of 4 could see that the ending was completely illogical; it felt like a very feeble attempt to tie two different movies together. <br /> <br />That leads to the second problem:  there were at least two different movies going simultaneously.  One movie was about a penguin being isolated because he's different and having to learn to be himself.  The other is about how humans are ruining the environment.  Someone needed to pick a movie and stick to it. <br /> <br />Third, if you are going to make this an environmental propaganda piece, at least try to keep from isolating major portions of your audience.  There were some racial stereotypes that many will find offensive.  There were a couple of broad swipes at religion and at conservatives.  And, of course, there's the ending that is so half-baked I found it insulting. <br /> <br />If there is one thing to be said for this movie, the animation is truly outstanding.  However, the above problems, along with possibly the worst Elvis impersonation I have every experienced in my life, overshadowed that lone triumph.  This movie may have beaten out Cars for the awards, but I found it highly overrated.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|This interpretation of The Great Gatsby portrayed my view of the setting and of Nick very well. The contrast between Gatsby's house and the Valley of the Ashes enlightened my picture of these places when I read about them. As for the characters, I thought Nick Carraway was performed brilliantly. He was the perfect contrast to self-absorbed high class society and portrayed Nick's sense of quiet akwardness. Tom Buchanan should have been a larger and more intimidating character. It said in the book that his muscles could be seen moving through his clothes and that when he walked into a room he filled the doorway, yet in this movie he appears to be too normally built for a football player. Daisy's character annoyed me, though this may have been done on purpose, and her scenes with Gatsby at his house when they are portrayed \\"in love\\" were so cheesy that I could not help but laugh. Overall, however, the movie is a great choice for anyone who is seeking a visual portrayal of The Great Gatsby because it follows the book fairly accurately, though I was not pleased with the absense of Owl Eyes in the film.

B000NA28IE|3.0|This movie was visually stunning.  The special effects and scenery were incredible, especially the CG work on the dragon.  The acting was also good.  However, this movie fell FAR short of the book and did not do it justice.  There was much that was changed or went unexplained, and while part of this is necessary when adapting a book to a movie, the movie could have been 20-30 minutes longer.  It would still have held the attention of a younger audience while fleshing out the storyline in preparation for the sequel.  My biggest disappointment was that ALL the characters looked human, there was nothing physical to distinguish elves and dwarves, and there was no mention that there were different humanoid races.  I'm not sure how this movie will segue into the next, as the framework was not set up to flow into the sequel.  Good luck to the writers for movie 2, they will need it!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am honored to be review #3015. <br /> <br />This show is innovative, engaging, compelling, and a damn good time. Rarely does one find better writing on television--better plotting, or a grander vision. There are enough surprises and clever twists of wit and plot to captivate the CSI generation. Borrowing from both its western and scifi roots, Firefly is not derivative and not recycled, but fresh and fascinating and a real joy to experience.  <br /> <br />The actors aren't particularly big, and that's the charm--they're not there for the money, but because they love what they do, and it shows. Nathan Fillion is a joy to watch, perfect for the role. Morena Baccarin is just gorgeous. The roles are so well cast and so well acted that you can lose yourself in a brand-new world. The show's real strength lies in the interaction between the characters--this isn't just an adventure through space but a collaboration of ten individuals doing what needs doing: living. Nine humans, and one spaceship, Firefly-class. <br /> <br />The show does have a spot of difficulty from varying directors and writers--Joss Whedon's episodes shine brighter, but he doesn't direct them all. However, the tone remains consistent and the characters are envisioned as such unique and strong individuals that they don't vacillate episode to episode but stay consistent and grow along the paths they should. And there are a number of moments in the show--a number of them having to do with Saffron--that are just pure and utter gold. <br /> <br />This is one of the few shows that I will sit down and watch over and over, from time to time--my wife and I know each episode by name and never argue on which one to watch: if there are two opinions, we just watch both. I compare the show in quality to X-Files, Alias, Lost . . . it's a treasured part of our collection. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this show highly enough. Rent it. Check it out of the library. Borrow it from a friend. Watch it.  <br /> <br />Youwill like what you see, and you will buy it. <br /> <br />And as for its supposed death? Well . . . let's hope the Browncloaks rise again.
B00005JP1C|3.0|Faith isn't a hard thing to lose, but it is a hard thing to let go of.  After all, even believing in nothing requires its own kind of faith.  Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank) is an ex-missionary, an ordained minister who lost her faith somewhere in the dreary hillocks of her troubled past.  Now she keeps her eyes in safer and saner (if not more clinical) pastures, spending her time as an LSU professor whose specialty is debunking myths and miracles.  She approaches her job with the grim satisfaction of an older brother telling his younger sibling that, no, Santa Claus is NOT real.<br /><br />Her services are soon required by a small town in New Orleans by the name of Haven (that's called \\"irony,\\" folks!).  It seems a local boy was recently killed.  It may or may not have been at the hands of a local girl, Loren.  The only thing that is certain is that, for some reason, the local river has turned to blood.  The uber-fundamentalist townfolk are certain that the ten Biblical plagues have come to their sleepy corner of the world, and they believe that the adorably creepy girl is the reason.<br /><br />Anna Sophia Robb ([[ASIN:B00005JPL5 Bridge to Terabithia]]) plays the questionable and mostly-mute tyke with the same sort of numb withdrawl that can be found in Swank's Katherine Winter.  Both actresses seem stunned to find themselves in such a schlocky movie, and neither one of them looks like they're having much fun.<br /><br />There's fun to be had, I suppose.  The plagues trundle across the screen dutifully, some of them thrown in off-handedly as if they were mere hurdles to cross (the plagues of flies and frogs are mostly laughable), others done succinctly to cool effect (the aforementioned river of blood, the plague of darkness).  Attached to these mostly gratuitous images is a story about sacrifice, devil worship, and heavenly vengeance.<br /><br />Although the plotting certainly isn't sloppy, it's also not very sound.  Much like a freshly erected stack of Jenga blocks, one gets the impression it wouldn't take two well-planned pokes to send the whole thing tumbling to the ground.  Katherine doesn't have much to do in the movie, in spite of her weird-n-wild surroundings, so most of her role consists of creepy dream after creepy dream, as well as so many jittering, incomprehensible flashbacks that the whole film threatens to turn into one epileptic-inducing trailer for itself.<br /><br />Trailers can be entertaining in and of themselves, though, and this is no real exception.  The shards of light and the scattered images do eventually resolve into some kind of sense.  Although that resolution isn't particularly surprising, it is industrious, at least until the final scene.  The makers of \\"The Reaping,\\" already a (happily) hackneyed film, tack on a (mordantly) hackneyed ending.  The result is labored and dumb, albeit not surprising.<br /><br />\\"The Reaping\\" is by no means a good film, and some would rightfully call it bad.  Given the decent story (such as it is) and the hokum it trots out with such cheesy abandon, I don't fault the film much for the flaws in its faith.  It's nice -- if even in a shadowy way -- to find, in the midst of a world without spirit, a movie that isn't afraid to flaunt its over-cooked soul.enga blocks, one gets the impression it wouldn't take two well-planned pokes to send the whole thing tumbling to the ground.

0312305060|4.0|I have no interest in Virginia Woolf.  I also have no interest in those books with particularly feminine slants, as I heard was true of THE HOURS.  So why read the book?  I was drawn to the concept of interconnecting three characters through a story arch larger than any of the individual lives involved.  Despite making my way through some text that I found to be a bit too flowery and emotive for my taste, I found Michael Cunningham does a very commendable job in this novel.  I guess the proof is in the results - I did finish the book and did enjoy it. <br /> <br />The book centers around Virginia Woolf and her writing of the book MRS. DALLOWAY.  Her struggles with her own internal demons and the life she leads around those demons segues into the lives of Laura Brown in 1949 and Clarissa Vaughn at the beginning of the 21st century, who, in their own particular ways, seem to be reflections of Woolf's life and creations.  All of the women are drawn realistically and convincingly, with much of the portrayals revolving around their internal rather than external worlds.  Cunningham's character development is strong enough to make even minor characters, such as Virginia's husband and Clarissa's daughter and Laura's neighbor, seem just as authentic and real as the main characters themselves. <br /> <br />The chapters skip between the characters yet nonetheless flow together smoothly.  Some emotion, action or relationship touched upon at the end of one chapter is usually picked up and carried on by another character in the next.  Again, the writing may be a bit too melodramatic for my taste (grass is not just green, it is impossibly green; there is not just a chip in a bowl, there is an inevitable chip in the bowl), yet it did not prevent me from becoming, if not captivated by the characters, at least interested in them enough to keep on reading.  If part of reading is to occasionally break out of patterns and one's literary comfort zones, THE HOURS did the job well with respect to myself.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|Instead of making a Miami Vice parody movie, or simply revisiting the television era with younger actors and a fresh plot, director Michael Mann takes the basics of Miami Vice and plants it firmly in 2006.  Here Crockett and Tubbs are tough, no nonsense cops who's lives are on the line.  Here the stakes are high, the villains are cunning, and the payoff is intense. <br /> <br />First things first, this is not an action film.  It's not trying to be one.  Instead it's a crime drama, delving into the worlds of cops (and a bit of the criminals) in the Miami area.  Instead of creating a series of climaxes (as he did in \\"Heat\\") this movie is closer to \\"Collateral\\".  It builds and builds with sparks flying here and there until the whole thing erupts in an excellent fire fight. <br /> <br />The script is tight, and moves a brisk pace.  Viewers need to pay attention and have an ear for accents (there are several floating around during the movie and I found it helpful to have the close captions on).  Direction is typical Michael Mann; everything has an elegant coolness to it.  Miami looks awesome in many of the shots of the film.  The movie is visually dark with lots of blue hues in it, giving it a definate visual style. <br /> <br />Sound effects were very good.  I especially liked the gun battle at the end of the film.  The weapons sounded realistic (not Hollywood).  I also enjoyed the score and music used in the film (fans of the television will be disappointed in the lack of 80's nostalgia). <br /> <br />The only weak points were casting.  Jamie Foxx and Naomie Harris were excellent and I found their relationship to be interesting and handled very well.  On the flip side I found Colin Farrell adequate at best and bland at worst.  He didn't seem to carry the part off as well as he could have.  In addition Gong Li, a beautiful woman and superb actress, was lacking something.  I'm not sure if her chemistry with Farrell was to blame, or if working in English was difficult, but she is great in certain scenes and in others she didn't click for me. <br /> <br />All told, I enjoyed the film.  I wished it had been a bit better (and I think different casting would have solved my main problems), but as part of Michael Mann's delving into the world of crime and cops, this is a solid entry.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This is a movie worth buying.  With a genuine feel, the story rings true.  I also like it because in the plot, there isn't clutter.  It hints at things and gradually enlightens the audience as it progresses.  (Rather than hitting you over the head with a sledehammer at the start and dragging out the next 2  hours.  Which seems to be the popular trend these days.)  Classic, timeless, and will look great in your collection.

Rocks Off, Soul Surivor Tumbling Dice and Ventilator Blues is a paint peeler. Sweet Virginia and Torn and Frayed are good country.Stop Breaking down and shake your Hips are good blues, good slide on stop Breaking Down Texas blues on Shake your Hips. Sweet Black Angel is great reggae.
B00005JMJG|4.0|A romantic comedy that breaks away from the tired formula.  Its worthwhile and I enjoyed it.  The only thing I didn't like was the scenes inside the apartment of Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) goofing off while Joel (Jim Carrey) lies unconcious on the bed - jumping around half naked on the bed and so forth.  It felt forced.  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give great performances while the others aren't on the same level.
B00006ADD5|5.0|I had never before seen one frame of this film, and now I hope one day to have the chance to see it on a big screen, even a big-screen tv.  Wherever this was filmed, it seems no-expense-spared in its lushness, in its sets, in its battle scenes.  Lean was at the top of his genius as far as I'm concerned.    O'Toole's performance was, as O'Toole himself, as T E Lawrence was, also, quirky, unpredictable, subtle.  His character seems to move from boredom to arrogance to brilliance to cynicisim to sensitivity to near-madness, and then back again. O'Toole's acting outshines everyone else's, even the estimable Alec Guinness, though Alec as King Faisal is fun to watch--he, too, like the British, uses Lawrence toward his own ends. He plays the \\"noble sheik\\" who wants to lead his own people, because he is just another power-hungry leader.     The desert scenes are beautiful, the glowing shots almost familiar because we've seen similar movie shots like these, but they were AFTER this film was made--it clearly inspired many imitators.  You can almost feel the desert heat and dirt.  The film also offers prescient insights into today's sectarian violence where religious and tribal loyalties and feuds are seemngly more important to many Arab leaders than are national agendas or progress for all their people.  The history within the film is mostly accurate and there is no neat wrap-up at the end, no ponderous speeches, no stirring conclusion.  I waited too long to see this film but now I know why it is a classic.  This is the wide-screen edition, which is essential to appreciating the cinematography.

B0000AUHQT|3.0|The movie version of the Great Gatsby did an excellent job of sticking to the plot of the book.  It used a lot of the dialogue from the book and changed very few major themes of the story.  Also, the movie does a great job of enabling the viewer to get a feel for the 1920's.  Between the wardrobe, the cars, Gatsby's parties and the dancing, it is hard not to fall in love with the roaring 20's thanks to this movie.     One area where I felt that this movie was lacking was the casting of the characters.  I believe that having Sam Waterson as Nick Carroway did not fit the movie very well.  I felt Robert Redford was an excellent Gatsby and also may have been a better Nick than Waterson.  One character that was clearly cast very well was Jordan Baker.  Miss Baker is gorgeous in the movie and plays the part perfectly.  The casting of the movie was not extraordinary but overall this movie is decently interesting.  The book is definitly better but the movie helps to visualize the book.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Barbra Streisand plays a singer who is discovered by a superstar, performed by Kris Kristofferson, whose career is going down the tubes because of his alcohol and drug dependency, combined with a reckless personality. <br /> <br />They soon initiate a relationship and fall madly in love with one another. They get married but he continues to diminish his stature while she gains in popularity. While his songs and music are decreasing in popularity and quality, her voice is capturing the hearts of fans everywhere, and the melodies she produces start to win awards. <br /> <br />Both performances are superb and the magnetism of both stars makes this movie a rather interesting story to watch.

B000OVLBF8|3.0|Over the years, Hollywood has based movies on Marvel Comics. Some of these movies--in the late 80's/90's--were TV based or went direct to video. It was not until 1998 that Hollywood made a major hit with Blade (Wesley Snipes [130 million worldwide].) Blade would be important in setting up other marvel-based movies such as \\"X-Men\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", and most currently \\"Ghost Rider\\" (2007).Ghost Rider could have been hotter than these previous films. But unfortunately, the story, the characters,and even the special effects could have better.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" is the story of Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage), and his father (Brett Cullen); who are father and son cyclists for a carnival in Texas. His father is unhappy with him because he is too much of a hotshot but Johnny disagrees. He is in love with his girlfriend Roxanne (Eva Mendes), but he learns that Roxanne is going away and he will do everything and anything to keep her at his side--even if it means leaving his career. That evening, Johnny learns from a letter that his father is dying from Cancer.<br /><br />Later that evening, as Johnny is working on his motorcycle, Mephistopheles ([the devil] Peter Fonda) approaches him and he tells the young cyclist that he will cure his dying father. At what cost? Johnny sells his soul to the devil--and after another tragedy-- leaves Roxanne.<br /><br />Years go by and Johnny soon meets up with his former lover--now a reporter--as well as Mephistopheles. This time he needs Johnny to become a Ghost Rider (supernatural fiery demon [Bounty hunter]) to obtain a powerful contract from a former rider before his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and his demonic henchmen gain possession of it. If Johnny completes this mission, Mephistopheles will return his soul to him. Will Blaze accept his offer?<br /><br />Unlike other previous Marvel films--Spider-man and X-men series--that gave us a strong storyline, character development, very good CGI special effects, this movie belongs in the category of Marvel's \\"B\\" adaptations of lesser known movies as Daredevil (2003), and Elektra (2005).<br /><br />First off, if this is the first movie in the franchise, then we need to know more about our character Johnny Blaze. Our writer (Mark Steven Johnson) never explains where Johnny lives, what kind of relationship he has with his father, and most importantly, how did he and his father become stunt cyclists. Instead, we get Sam Elliot in the beginning of the movie giving us a cheesy narration of a former Rider's origin. Therefore, the narration being brief is much like the rest of the film.<br /><br />The story and the characters leave us confused. Let's take Blackheart and his henchmen for example; at first, he is Mephistopheles creation, then later (Elliot) tells us he is a fallen Angel, and then Blackheart makes a reference that he is his son. The Henchmen, also give unclear theme. Are they Mephistopheles' creation, or Blackheart's? It is also unclear about what Ghost Rider's character is supposed to do. Is he supposed to be the Spirit of Vengeance (a vigilante) or a Bounty Hunter for Mephistopheles? Even the love relationship between Johnny and Roxanne--why bother?--feels awkward. The movie is perplexing as it is.<br /><br />The special effects for the most part are very TV-like, except for some sequences where Ghost Rider himself is the focal point. The riding sequences and his transformation are technically good, but uncreative. For instance, when he is riding up a building, or going by cars on the street and making their car alarms go off, and even when he is riding under the water. When Ghost Rider is fully transformed, it reminds us of Scorpion from Mortal Combat.<br /><br />Ghost Rider becomes more laughable with the villains; Blackheart is walking down the street and lights are going off one by one--probably a crew member was in charge of shutting off the light switch. What about The Henchmen and their elemental effects? The water looks like something from my bathtub, but what made us really laugh was the \\"Vampire henchmen.\\" The vampire's effects looked like smoke from a burned out campfire with the left over smoke. The fighting sequences with Ghost Rider are just too easy for him and the choreography was very robotic. There is virtually no challenge from these foes; they were as simple as a first level of a video game.<br /><br />An original movie needs a history and the audience must have a connection much like past movies such as \\"Spiderman\\", \\"The X-Men\\" and even \\"Blade\\", which started it all. This film gave us a very spotted and sloppy story, and very clich&eacute; villains. The critics would have had an easier time understanding this character if he was more of a loner, and if the movie specifically focused on him taking the vengeance on the criminals of society. I recommend this movie for the veteran Ghost Rider fan and the general comic book geek.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]] <br />This series contains some of the most spectacular nature photography ever recorded.  By using a combination of ground and aerial coverage they are able to provide a visual perspective and an intimacy with animal behavior never before possible - without the participants being aware of the photography process.  I also found the narration of the original BBC version more spirited and interesting than the U.S. version currently being broadcast over the Discovery Channel. <br />I would strongly recommend this series to anyone with a serious interest in our \\"planet earth\\" and all of the wonders it still has to offer. <br /> <br />

If you are looking for an authoritative explanation of the hidden abilities locked away in the subconscious mind, this is the book for you.  I am using this book as a supplement to some of the ideas discussed in The Secret by Rhonda Byrne.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I found the Planet Earth DVD series to be totally outstanding!! Great video, amazing scenes, very informative, exciting. I'm not what you would call a \\"tree hugger\\", but it helped me understand what's happening to our \\"Home\\", and the fact that if we as citizens of Planet Earth dont do something very soon, this beautiful, amizing, and wonderful planet will be forever changed. Very glad I purchased the series.
0439813786|5.0|We purchased this book because it was part of Al Roker's Today Show kids' summer book club.  We were very pleased that it is an absolutely beautiful book.  It is filled with wonderful pictures that really drew in our children, ages 4 and 7.  It was a great family read, and we were able to complete it quickly.  The book looks intimidating, but there is actually a very limited quantity of text.  My 7 year old also enjoyed reading it on her own and showing off what a thick/\\"long\\" book she was reading by herself.

B000031XCR|5.0|I decided to buy this CD since there's definitely a handful of Celine songs that I love, all of which are included here. I first came to know Celine's talent when as a little kid I had the \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" videotape and I would leave the film playing after the movie had ended just to hear the theme song during the closing credits (how's that for a 7 year-old boy?) For the next decade and a half, I witnessed her transition from a promising new vocalist to a full-fledged diva in the ranks of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston (oddly enough, her big break came relatively late). Anyway, some great songs on this album, my personal favorite being \\"The Power Of Love\\" and \\"That's The Way It Is\\".
0618680004|5.0|Being a young adult raised in a Fundamental Christian missionary family, evolution was always taught as false--something the devil wants us to believe. Although I (an agnostic) do not subscribe to everything Dawkins presents as evidence, his viewpoints were so informative and his studies so detailed, that he had my attention through the whole book and gave me a lot more knowledge on the subject of a god-governed/godless world. It was my first Dawkins book to read and I was impressed. It filled the hole in my early education that was previously only Bible-based. I immediately bought a second copy and sent it to a friend.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am happy to add mine to the list and include another five star rating.  I only just came upon this series, through watching a friend's copy, along with the film, Serenity.  I am now on my way to buy my own copies.  I knew nothing of Firefly before this, and so there was no hype enticing me to watch--just a friend's suggestion that I would enjoy it.  This series is clever, entertaining, and challenges the viewer to keep up with a fast witty, and at times very funny, script. You don't have to be an avid sc-fi aficionado to enjoy this show, but it certainly helps if you enjoy a good plot and a certain dry wit. The sad thing is, the show was cancelled after just one season, which was unfair to the production company, writers, actors, and ultimately... the viewers. My advice is to treat yourself and just buy the series and film and enjoy the ride to its conclusion.
0316018953|4.0|The Overlook by Michael Connelly was originally written as installments for the New York Times Magazine.  Although I didn't read The Overlook in the Times, Connelly claims that this novel is substantially \\"expanded and revised.\\"  While small in size, The Overlook packs a mighty punch.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is a detective with the LAPD and now works for the Homicide Special, part of the city's elite Robbery-Homicide Division.  Bosch is called out on a case when the body of Dr. Stanley Kent is discovered at the overlook.  Bosch realizes that this is not an ordinary case when FBI agent Rachel Walling also appears at the scene.  Bosch and Walling share a past that has been more than professional and always complicated.  Kent was a medical physicist in charge of radioactive medical supplies.  The fear is that terrorists may have been responsible for his murder, as well as the possible theft of 32 tubes of highly radioactive cesium.  While Bosch focuses on finding the killer, Walling and the FBI worry about finding the cesium.  But as usual, the FBI tries to cut Bosch out of the case (something that Bosch refuses to do gracefully).<br /><br />How this case plays out is pure genius on Connelly's part and the plot took me by surprise.  But what kept me from giving The Overlook five stars is the length.  At a mere 225 pages, it's much too short and we've come to expect more from the author.  As I've said before, however, Connelly is still one of the best mystery writers out there and The Overlook still is a masterful book.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|First, and most important thing to know.  This LP album isn't like the other ones.  They've taken their sound back to the edge again.  And its sweet.  I was disappointed that Mike wasn't rhyming ask much, but its still damn good.<br /><br />Most of the review that complain about it are mad because they don't sound like they used too, but the true LP fans know that they wanted to try something new because other bands we starting to copy their style.<br /><br />Many artists do the samething to keep fresh.<br /><br />Think I'm wrong, check out NIN, KORN,U2.

In fact, I had thought of the same concepts before, but never thought that it's worth writing a book about. <br /> <br />The author is incredibly arrogant. At first, I thought he was just putting down a rival trader - a bit tongue-in-cheek, but then realized that he seems to have that attitude to anybody that isn't him. <br /> <br />I regret paying money for this book, and wish I could get the 2 hours of my life that I wasted on it back.
0440180295|5.0|Wow. This was my first exposure to Kurt Vonnegut, and definitely won't be my last. <br /> <br />Slaughterhouse-Five takes you on a mind-blowing journey through the disjointed life of Billy Pilgrim. The focus of his life is thus: He had a laughable military service in World War II, consisting mostly of being a POW while in shock. After the war, he lived in an insane asylum for awhile, where he became a fan of author Kilgore Trout, who is a central character throughout Billy's life. He married Valencia, the daughter of a rich optometrist, making him into a rich optometrist himself. He was the sole survivor of a plane crash full of optometrists. He was kidnapped on his daughter's wedding night by aliens from Tralfamadore, kept on display in a zoo there. During his time in the zoo, he was mated with a Hollywood starlet named Montana Wildhack, who never returned to earth, instead being kept there to raise the baby in the zoo. Billy ends his life by being assassinated by someone he was a POW with in Dresden, Germany, who made good on his promise. Billy gave speeches on time travel and alien abduction, and told the crowd about his death beforehand. <br /> <br />What is so unusual about Billy Pilgrim, is that he \\"has come unstuck in time,\\" meaning that his awareness randomly jumps forwards and backwards to different points in his life, so that he not only experiences his whole life in bits and pieces and completely out of order, but he additionally has full access to the memories of everything that has happened in-between. Thus, he basically can remember every detail of his entire life before and as it is happening. <br /> <br />The ingenious part of the story is that it is told in the same disjointed manner that Billy experiences it in, so that even though his memory tells us ahead of time what is going to happen, we still begin very much in the dark, and over time, as we experience more and more of the different parts of Billy's life, it begins to congeal into a coherentwhole that makes sense to us in the same way that it does for Billy. <br /> <br />I am consistently amazed as I read through the book and how much detail there is, and at how consistently and frequently Vonnegut's writing makes references back to those details. It truly brings everything together in your mind, and something that is humorous the first time becomes increasingly so each time a reference is made down the road that reminds you of it again. Truly, Vonnegut is a master of stylistic writing, and in a style that no one else could hope to emulate. <br /> <br />This is one of the most memorable books I have ever read. A+, highly recommended!

B000NVIGC0|4.0|Wow, Wilco releases a new CD and the masses are all over the map with their opinions.  Is there another band out there capable of soliciting such varied opinions (perhaps Radiohead...)? I will always consider the Wilco fan as one most capable of appreciating interesting and compelling music.   Unfortunately, when the bar is raised so high, there will always be someone disappointed with the effort.  I say relax and enjoy the ride.  While I applaud the high expectations, music like art, is a reflection of the artist.  Commerce might dictate that your enjoyment is critical to their continued success.  However, if their focus is centered on how YOU interpret their work, they've compromised what sets them apart from everyone else.   <br />How can anyone not like this CD?  Yes, as is usually the case, there are a few tracks I am not crazy about (Shake it Off).  Impossible Germany is Wilco at their best.  Yes, the overall feel of the CD is one of introspection.  There are a number of slower songs reminscient of their earlier days and less of the technology imagery we've come to expect from the band (Either Way, On and one and on, Please be Patient with me, Sky blue Sky). Consider what Tweedy has endured and hopefully you understand and appreciate the heartfelt emotions.  I can't wait to hear the new songs live.  As has always been the case with Wilco, hearing their material live adds even more depth to their always inspiring work.  I love what Nels Cline brings to the band.  Great work from what I consider to be one of the greatest active bands going!
B000O178BY|5.0|This is by far some of NIN's best music. It uses some elements from previous albums, from Pretty Hate Machine to The Fragile and With Teeth, but still manages to be unique and have its own sound. Year Zero has a great mixture of loud and powerful (Survivalism, My Violent Heart, Meet Your Master) and lighter and just as sharp tracks (The Good Soldier, Me, I'm Not, In This Twilight). If you enjoy NIN and any of their previous albums, this one will make a great addition to the collection.

B000MXPE7O|3.0|As a filmmaker, Robert DeNiro shows the influence of his generation of great directors like Scorsese and Coppola with this epic-length 2006 film. In fact, there is a certain structural similarity to [[ASIN:B0001NBNB6 The Godfather]] in DeNiro's careful unfolding of the time-spanning story penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. The plot focuses on a fictionalized account of the first twenty years of the CIA as seen through the experiences of one agent named Edward Wilson, an intentionally cryptic study in excessive self-control which makes him ideal for his career. Ironically, the main problem with the film is the stoic coldness of the central character for which DeNiro and Roth cannot seem to find a voice that would make the story resonate. There is little sense of a personal journey for Wilson, even though there are hints of it beginning with his father's suicide, which is used as a leitmotif throughout the story.<br /><br />Another frustration of the film is the constant time-jumping between the fallout over the failed Bay of Pigs mission in 1961 and key episodes in Wilson's earlier years. The technique doesn't make the drama any more interesting than it really is. Unfortunately there is no getting around the fact that despite the handsome production detail, the movie is a slog at 248 minutes and quite often, an amazing bore. DeNiro has assembled a can't-miss cast, including himself as a pre-CIA operative, but for the most part, they are stranded by a script consisting of coded exchanges and predictable dialogue, the latter most prevalent in the domestic scenes. Matt Damon does all he can as the poker-faced Wilson, but he is given little latitude to elicit empathy for his character.<br /><br />While she starts out with her fiery persona intact, Angelina Jolie has a progressively smaller role as Wilson's increasingly embittered wife Clover merely defined by how shut off she is from Wilson's clandestine profession. DeNiro inexplicably does not age either Damon or Jolie with any conviction over the course of the story, and there is an oddly unsettling dynamic when they are shown as the parents of a fully grown son. Better among the huge cast are William Hurt as a lifelong mentor; Tammy Blanchard as Wilson's true love, a hearing-impaired coed with whom he is reunited years later; Billy Crudup as a rather fey British counterspy; Alec Baldwin as a covert FBI agent; and John Turturro as Wilson's no-nonsense colleague. The 2007 DVD is short on extras, as it just contains seven deleted scenes of little additional interest. Unsurprisingly, the taciturn DeNiro does not offer a director's commentary here.ie with any conviction over the course of the story, and there is an oddly unsettling dynamic when they are shown as the parents of a fully grown son.

If you like The Doors, you'll like the original.  My particular favorites include Shaman's Blues, Wild Child and the title track. <br /> <br />The Rhino remix includes several additional tracks including Who Scared You and 2 versions of Whisky, Mystics and Men.  These tracks are hard to find elsewhere, very strong, and bump this version of the CD up to 4 stars.
B000JVT092|3.0|This should normally have been a five-star rating but there were a couple of things that irked me, despite some of the inconsistencies.  It was funny, the visual effects have been much improved since the last Superman releases, the acting was very impressive, and the story has been moved forward in a way that fans have been begging for a very long time. <br /> <br />But for a Superman movie there was a lot of talk, talk, talk, talk, talk... while leaving everybody waiting for the next bit of action.  The action does come, but in small little pieces that leave you wishing for more.  This movie does not give Superman the screentime to really show off his powers. <br /> <br />I was also irked by some of the changes.  For instance, the phrase, \\"life, liberty, and all that stuff?\\"  What, is the American Way not good enough anymore?  And some of the comparisons between Superman and Jesus Christ were a little unsettling.  Christ is the founder of one of the largest religions on this planet, DC shouldn't be getting such an ego comparing their comic book character to him. <br /> <br />I got the High Definition edition of Superman and was very disappointed.  The picture quality, while better than DVD, was not as good as most of the other DVD movies that I've picked up.  The lack of high definition was very surprising considering the money put into this movie. <br /> <br />I hope they make a sequel, there is still a lot to learn and see from Superman.  And now that film technology has caught up (and bypassed) the imagination of DC comics I hope they don't delay on making more movies.
B000P2A256|2.0|I loved the first album, \\"Songs about Jane\\".  The tunes were diverse.  It seemed the songs were much more thought out since if I understand correctly, it was mainly two guys writing the material.  This CD is over-produced with not enough sweat in the compositional area.  There are a few melodies floating around, but nothing that could stand the test of time here.  What kills me is that they took so long to produce it.  It sounds like a later 1970's style as disco was making it's end.....too much funky sound happening here.  They sound too much like Sly and the family stone....the first CD sounded more diverse.
B000M341QE|4.0|Couldn't even pause the film to answer the door or a call of nature, that's how exciting it was, and yet at the end of the day we felt a little cheated out of something.  Yes, the movie resembles the HK INTERNAL AFFAIRS, but that was so long ago I forgot I had seen it till the very end of TD.  I guess maybe its reliance on an outlandish plot setup made me feel it was a little artificial as opposed to the Cassavetes-ish sense of improvisation and hyper-reality you used to get from the old De Niro-Scorsese films.  The storyline is so crazy that you felt the actors, good as they were, must have always been asking themselves, why am I in this situation again, and many of them seemed to bark out their insanely violent Monahan dialogue only by biting the inside of their mouths to keep from laughing.<br /><br />Nicholson seems like he's into it, and he made the movie much better than it is at heart, by really unleashing for once that tragic power we all know he has but hasn't emerged since the Joker took over.  Is it true that Jack got the part after Daniel Day Lewis turned it down?  If so, good for Dan, he made room for a better man.<br /><br />Matt and Leo were both in there swinging, but they should have traded parts, and as for the divine Vera Farmiga, she must have thought the movie was about a woman's sexual growth, but too late she found out it was about a bunch of guys and how arteries explode under gunfire.  Scorsese and his screenwriter took care to expand her part and to shield MS from further accusations that he is running a billionaire boys club in Hollywood, but alas Vera failed to score the critical acclaim Cate Blanchett did in THE AVIATOR.  But she was a cartoon and Farmiga was trying to play someone real.<br /><br />The picture was long, but it was rushed too, and not a single one of the sequences would hold up if you took the time to analyze what was happening within the story structure.

Musicianship not on the same level as virtuoso Dream Theater (that is - PT doesn't try to impress with speed and crazy good technique). But the compositions and lyrics are far superior (especially compared with some of DTs latest albums). This live performance does justice to a lot of PTs best/recent work. A must have for any serious prog fan.
B000683VI4|5.0|Wonderful, yet sad movie. Very touching for the chick-flick girl in me. Actually my husband likes it, too! I had a copy, but bought this one for my Mom, whom I know will love it as well. It makes you look at Alzheimer patients in a new light, if you've never known anyone who has it. If you've had someone in your family with it, you really cry during the whole last 30 minutes! I do everytime I see it. It is also a very romantic movie and a showing of what true love is. It is PG-13, and because of a few scenes and language, I suggest over age 13, at least.
1400063515|4.0|As a far more in depth follow up to Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Taleb expounds his thinking on randomness with a full frontal assault on the academics in both the sciences and philosophy.  It would be difficult to find a bigger challenge on what we think and how we think it, and how it is taught.<br /><br />The idea of the Black Swan is the extreme event that lies outside the predictable models. The impact of the Black Swan events are often so huge that it renders the academic models absolutely useless.  For example, half of the gains from the stock market in the last fifty years can be attributed to ten days in the market.<br /><br />The notorious failure of Long Term Capital, an investment firm run by the brightest of the brightest; a pair of Phd Nobel Prize winning economists, is attributed to their investment model that did not account for the now proverbial black swan.<br /><br />But Taleb's account applies far beyond the investment or business world, one that he succeeded in early in life.<br /><br />While he begins with observations into our misguided understanding of randomness and the empirical challenges that we ignore; he addresses the work of scientific, literary and philosophical figures that will leave many of the readers (especially including myself) feeling a bit low brow.  Yet in the conclusion he brings his exploration and thinking back to a very practical yet poetical pragmatism, ending the book with a feeling of enlightenment and joy.<br /><br />\\"We are quick to forget that just being alive is an extraordinary piece of good luck, a remote event, a chance occurrence of monstrous proportions. ....remember that you are a Black Swan.\\"
B000E1MTY0|5.0|When the film technology finally caught up to the imagination of comic book writers many movies were made that showed off the visual effects a movie has to offer.  While these movies have gone on to becoming blockbusters, comic book fans (like myself) have often complained about the story. <br /> <br />Batman Begins is one of the few exceptions as the story not only grips you to your seat hanging on every word, but blowing your mind by the visual effects. <br /> <br />And to make things even better, we the high definition (HD DVD) edition is even BETTER.  Every scene is crisp and makes you feel like a participant of the movie. <br /> <br />Of all the Batmans, Christian Bale captures the dark, tortured side of our dark-winged hero better than the others.  His acting is amazing and does a fantastic job of showing how Batman became Batman and how he overcame his biggest enemy: his fears. <br /> <br />The choice of enemies was surprising but it looks like if they are going to do a sequel they will be returning to his biggest nemesis: the Joker.  If Bale can surpass Keaton as Batman, they are going to have an uphill battle finding a better Joker than Nickleson.  But if the caliber of movie making matches this movie, I'll catch it even if they cast Ben Stein into the part. <br /> <br />This is most definitely a must-see for any comic book or action movie fan.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|When I read advance reviews for Sola Scriptura, \\"controversial\\" was a term often attached to its description. Some may find it to be so because Morse throws down the spiritual gauntlet in an uncompromising way, but I don't find in it anything that should be a source of controversy with anyone except those for whom a robust expression of religious faith is anathema. <br />Personally, I like Sola Scriptura more everytime I hear it. It is a grand progressive rock epic in the best tradition of some of the finest prog of the 70s and is an album that I find tremendously satisfying, both spiritually and musically. It has unity of theme and a very logical musical progression. As I listen, I am often reminded of the greatest works of Procol Harum, particularly when I focus on the spectacular drum work of Mike Portnoy. <br />You don't have to be on Neal Morse's page spiritually to enjoy this. The songs are very well written and thought-provoking. Contrary to the assertions of several reviewers, there is no hate here at all. If you don't like hearing an explicitly Christian message, then tune out the lyrics and just enjoy the music. <br />In my opinion, Sola Scriptura is one of the top progressive albums of the year thus far. You get over 75 minutes of great music, and the CD comes with a booklet containing the lyrics. It is definitely the heaviest of the quartet of \\"Christian\\" solo albums Neal Morse has recorded since leaving Spock's Beard. I certainly look forward to his next effort. If you like good old-fashioned progressive rock, then ignore the critics and add this to your music library. Sola Scriptura will never be dated. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AUHQT|4.0|The Great Gatsby movie directed by Robert Redford was everything that I pictured the Great Gatsby to be. The characters at times were a little over the edge, but the setting and the props used depicted the 1920's perfectly. Gatsby in the movie was perfect for the part along with Nick, but I did not think that the character that played Tom was what I pictured from the book. Over all the movie was what I pictured when I read the Great Gatsby and was very enjoyable to watch.
0380789035|3.0|I'll never understand why some people feel the need to write scathing reviews.  Obviously, Gaiman is a good writer because he's successful and the majority of people like his work.  Don't the naysayers understand that just because THEY don't like a book, doesn't mean the book is bad?<br /><br />With American Gods, Gaiman creates an interesting hodgepodge of characters from various god pantheons and throws them together when the protagonist, Shadow, is exposed to these once-great deities who no longer have omnipotence because they are no longer worshiped like before.  This is the kind of stuff Gaiman has always done well: expose his readers to many branches of mythology while keeping it as exciting as it is interesting and educational. I deducted points because it could have used a bit more characterization and the ending was a bit obvious, but I still liked the book and recommend it to all.

B0000AUHQT|3.0|The 1974 movie of The Great Gatsby was a decent version of the book, but I would not say that it was excellent.  First of all, the movie was cast horribly.  Tom did not seem like how F. Scott Fitzgerald described him at all.  The same happened with Myrtle.  Daisy was just plain annoying.  Nick was boring and seemed to shy.  The only characters in the book that were cast right were Jordan Baker and Gatsby himself.   <br /> I do have to say that the movie did stay true to the book, but there were a few things missing.  Nothing extremely important though.  The one scene that was different from the book was when Nick met Gatsby for the first time.  I did not like how the director changed this part.  I also thought it was strange when Gatsby started to throw his shirts around.  That was just not how I imagined that scene when I read it in the book.  Two other things that I did really enjoy were the costumes and the scenery.  The costume seemed very true to the time period and the scenery, especially Gatsby's house was exactly like I imagined.  Over-all the movie was not that bad.  It was true to the book and a good movie to watch once you have read the book.  If casting and the few scenes that were changed are overlooked the movie itself is not that bad.       <br />

B000NQR7KC|2.0|What can I say...I'm so disappointed. I was hoping that some of the reviews for the new Genesis remasters on Amazon UK were wrong - but unfortunately they're not. Compression has once again tarnished a classic title, and this time it's been done to a disc that is targeted at audiophiles (hybrid SACD). What were they thinking?! The remix, on the other hand, clears up the muddiness of the previous mix, allowing you to hear things that were buried before. This could have been a revelation with less compression.<br /><br />I bought this version, out of the four that are currently offered, because I've been very pleased with the CD layers of the various hybrids I've purchased over the last few years. DSD is the way of the future, whether for redbook CD or SACD, and it's the superior transfer method at this time, but the people who were involved in this project obviously weren't audio purists. They had the tools (DSD) available to them that would have allowed them to make a beautiful remaster, but they screwed the pooch instead.
0743496728|4.0|I'm hooked on Jodi Picoult, whom I discovered only recently (yes, I was living in a cave). I haven't yet worked my way through all of her previous 13 novels (four down, nine to go), but I've read enough to know that her work is consistently intelligent, reliably moving and irresistibly readable.   <br /> <br />This is not to say that it's lighthearted. If you are a person of a certain age, you will remember how made-for-television movies (the network kind) used to popularize diseases such as anorexia, crimes such as domestic violence and incest, and all manner of ethical dilemmas. Films of this ilk now survive mainly on LIFETIME, but the need for catharsis --- to dramatize, relive and try to make sense of a shocking and tragic event --- is still very much with us, and that's where Picoult comes in. She takes the most difficult, ambiguous questions --- Is it ever right to kidnap your own child? Does a kid have to donate body parts to her grievously ill sister? When a dying spouse asks you to kill her, should you do it? --- and animates them with a wonderful cast of characters, almost always flawed, attractive, small-town folks who are struggling to do the right thing. <br /> <br />NINETEEN MINUTES takes as its starting point the mass shootings, usually by students, in high schools, Columbine being the best known. Other writers have mined this territory. Indeed, Stephen King's RAGE (his first book, published in 1977 under the pseudonym Richard Bachman) was pulled from bookstores because it apparently inspired one of the incidents. There is also the 2003 Orange Prize winner, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, Lionel Shriver's dark, edgy meditation on parenthood and inborn evil. <br /> <br />Picoult's version, in contrast, is rooted right smack in the soil of ordinary Technicolor life. One reason her novels have such immediacy is that she deals not in psychopaths and rebels but people well within the range of normal, or so it seems. She imagines something bizarre and awful happening to the family next door, the family that could be hers, or mine, or yours. She seems willing to take on horrific moral conundrums without flinching or evasion. She doesn't just touch on an issue --- she probes it and stomps it and turns it inside out. And her novels almost always end in a trial sequence that forces the characters to come to terms with their reality, giving her work a satisfying \\"Law & Order\\"-style symmetry.  <br /> <br />The title NINETEEN MINUTES refers to how long it takes the shooter, Peter Houghton, to complete a bloody rampage through his New Hampshire high school: \\"In nineteen minutes,\\" Picoult writes, \\"you can order a pizza and get it delivered. You can read a story to a child or have your oil changed. You can walk a mile. You can sew a hem. In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge.\\" There is no pussyfooting around. She begins the book on the day of the massacre, when we barely know any of the people involved (though Patrick DuCharme, the detective who is one of the first on the scene, is a carryover character from one of her earlier books, PERFECT MATCH). This isn't a conventional suspense novel in the sense that there is no murkiness about what happened or who did it; the really enormous mystery is why.  <br /> <br />To answer that, Picoult needs to let the reader in on the facts of the past without losing her grip on the drama of the present, and she pulls it off with a cinematically orchestrated narrative that counterpoints the current investigation and trial with a series of vivid flashbacks. She focuses mainly on two families: the parents of the shooter, Lacy and Lewis Houghton; and Alex Cormier, a public defender turned judge whose daughter, Josie, a former friend of Peter (one of the few kids who had anything to do with him), was a key witness to the slaughter. <br /> <br />This subject is a natural for Picoult, who has always seemed particularly interested in parental love. It is the tendency of our culture to favor nurture over nature, holding parents responsible for the way a child turns out, good or bad. What greater test, then, of what a mother or father has done --- or failed to do --- than a son who commits mass murder? And what greater tragedy than to have a beloved teenage child shot down or traumatized before he or she has had a chance at life? Picoult gets inside the heads of parents on both sides of this divide; she is unremittingly fair, which is how this book manages to dwell mainly in the gray areas of the issue, neither condemning Peter and his parents nor letting them off the hook.  <br /> <br />Some readers may object that the shooter is too sympathetic. We root for Peter partly because of his nice-guy defense counsel, Jordan McAfee (also a carryover from previous novels), but mostly because of the book's persuasive portrait of the brutality of high school life. Peter is the perennial misfit who has been cruelly bullied since his first day in school, but bullying is really too petty-sounding a word for the tortures the popular kids put him through; sadism is more like it. And bullying is a close relative of other sorts of abuse, as Josie, wounded in the melee, finds out. She has gone from an outsider to an insider, thanks to her status as the girlfriend of Matt Royston, the school's star hockey player. But this \\"promotion\\" has its costs --- and, eventually, desperate consequences for her, Peter and Matt himself. <br /> <br />Is the book too formulaic? Well, you can't write 14 bestsellers without getting a bit predictable: the pat sign-offs at the end of each section, the melodramatic trial scenes, the redemptive romance at the end. Picoult could be a little more subtle and risk-taking --- but she couldn't be more likable, honest and heartfelt. There's no one else with whom I'd rather sit down and thrash out an issue that has no easy answer.  <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman <br />

075640407X|5.0|With THE NAME OF THE WIND, Patrick Rothfuss has propelled himself instantly into the fantasy elite, unraveling a story that is beautiful, mythic and dark. This is the debut fantasy work that all writers wish was theirs and that all readers wish had a quicker follow-up. <br /> <br />Kote is the owner and operator of a tavern residing in a town that is slowly becoming obsolete, where business is practically nonexistent. His nightly endeavor is to serve spirits and stew to the same handful of people while stories and legends are shared. When one of the townsfolk comes into the tavern bearing the corpse of a Scraeling, a spider creature with legs like razors, he begins to fear the worst. <br /> <br />Kote, who is far more than a simple tavern owner, holds a secret that he doesn't want revealed. However, his true identity has been figured out by a biographer who discovers that Kote is actually Kvothe (pronounced \\"Quothe\\"), a notorious magician who is praised as a hero and likewise reviled as a villain all across the world. And presumed to have been long dead. <br /> <br />Now found out, Kvothe tells the biographer everything --- about his life as a young boy with a traveling troupe of players, living as a feral child on the streets of the faraway port city of Tarbean, and his education at the legendary school of magic. <br /> <br />Kvothe's goal is simple: to discover the secret magic of naming but also to delve into the mysteries of the Chandrian demons who were responsible for the murder of his parents. <br /> <br />Rothfuss has an exceptional grasp of his story. While this is no streamlined A to B telling, the novel hones in on details yet never does so at the expense of propelling the story forward. It seems that every item mentioned bears weight to the tale and shares in its support --- so much so that to extract them would collapse the work in on itself. His language is simple, and he doesn't flaunt a vast vocabulary, but he has a spectacular way with the turn of aphrase that sets the scene vividly in your mind. <br /> <br />The story itself may contain some cliches common to the fantasy genre, but the author provides just enough tweaks to make them both comfortably familiar and strikingly new. There are very few portions of the story that seem too standard or found too often in other tales. For the most part, the work is vibrant and exciting. <br /> <br />As a character, Kvothe is outstanding. He is dark, brooding and intelligent to no end. Sometimes it may seem that he knows far too much, but then again he is a student  from the most legendary magic school in the world. His retelling of his life is gripping and told with a true storyteller's voice. <br /> <br />THE NAME OF THE WIND is the mountaintop for fantasy work so far this year. All other novels, especially first ones, will have an extremely difficult time in finding a way out of the shadow of this extraordinary tome. Rothfuss has sent up major flares that will serve as a warning to the big names like Martin, Goodkind and Jordan. Whether you are a reader of fantasy or simply a lover of a great story, you owe it to yourself to take up THE NAME OF THE WIND and spend some time with brilliance. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard <br />

Real stories provide real evidence; anybody can make up a story to suit their points.   <br />(iv) He spends much more time attacking ideas than embracing them.  We have too many critics today who are happy to yell out 'THAT'S WRONG!' but lack that ambition and the backbone to determine and pronounce true solutions to things that they believe are wrong. <br />(v) His ideas that 'we can't forecast' and 'we can't model situations' is just wrong and irresponsible.  If that were the case, we would all go back to being hunter-gatherers; \\"screw investing in a farm!, you CANT BE SURE that a drought won't occur!\\".  Well droughts DO occur, and a farmer could go bankrupt, but overall society has blossomed for making investments (like a crop) based on forecasted results and the fact that droughts can occur doesn't mean that forecasting how many potatoes you can grow assuming no droughts isn't a worthwhile exercise; it just mean that you have to take proper consideration for the caveats any given forecast/model/plan. <br /> <br />While he brings up some great points, he, in my opinion, comes to some wrong conclusions based on these due to his cynicism and blinding anger (about issues such as his previous home in Lebanon).  I am very sympathetic to the issues he has/is going through,but I urge readers to consider that they are reading conclusions of a very unpeaceful mind. <br /> <br />My biggest problem with Taleb's book is that it suggests that one shouldn't make a sizable investment in any one item, but in my opinion, life is often all about investing in 1 relationship, 1 purpose, 1 dream, etc.  You have to throw caution to the wind sometimes and just live your life.  You spend too much time overthinking everything and you'll end up miserable.

Sure, Chris is homeless and poor, but we know he eventually succeeds.  Also, every executive Chris encounters treats him nicely or with respect, so we never see Chris as the object of ridicule that he could have been considering his at time rough appearance.  This is a well made movie and entertaining, but it moves along at a predictable pace<br /><br />By no means do I think this is a bad movie. I highly recommend it. Smith is excellent, his kid (Jaden Smith) isn't as good of an actor as some have said. Especially enjoyable is Chris's interaction with some of the Dean Witter clients and his ploy to get free tickets to a San Francisco 49ers game. This movie has a few moments of bad language but other than that is a good family film.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I just came back from watching this film and I can't get this movie out of my mind. I think the best way to describe this film is how I read in one review; \\"a visual album.\\" I think this movie marks the beginning of the modern musical. The film is filled with one great song after another but effortlessly transitions from dialogue into song. However, this movie is more than just a great musical, it's a great love story. After seeing this film, I went on my laptop and ordered this album as quickly as I could. Since I haven't listened to the album outside of the film, I'll focus my commentary on the film itself. The leads have great chemistry and the script masterfully invites the viewer to see how their love unfolds. I must warn people interested in seeing this film that I love for this type of music is necessary to fully appreciate this film. It is along the lines of Damien Rice (the leads were the opening act on one of Damien Rice's tours). This movie is one of the most genuine films I've seen in a long time, something that means a lot amidst the Hollywood films of recent years. I highly recommend this film, but caution an interested viewer to know what there in for before they watch this film.
B00064WSNM|4.0|This 1974 release by King Crimson presents a nice mixture of studio tracks and live tracks. With respect to the live tracks, We'll Let You Know was a purely improvisational piece taken from a concert held in Glasgow Scotland, while The Mincer (another improvised jam) was recorded in Zurich, Switzerland and overdubbed in the studio. Three tracks including Trio; Fracture; and Starless and Bible Black were recorded at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, as was the introduction to The Night Watch (the remainder was recorded in the studio). For those of you that are curious, the complete Amsterdam Concertgebouw concert was released by the band as The Night Watch, which is a fantastic sounding 2-CD document of this powerful lineup live.<br /><br />The lineup on this album is considered to be the finest Crimson lineup assembled and I do not disagree.  The players at this point included David Cross (violin, viola, mellotron); Robert Fripp (electric guitar; mellotron; and devices); John Wetton (electric bass guitar; lead vocals); and the incredible Bill Bruford (drums and percussion).  The performances on the live tracks are out of this world and amply demonstrate the power of this group as an improvisational unit of considerable power and imagination.  Robert Fripp turns in some excellent performances throughout (his complex, cross-picking technique really shines on the closing track) and seems to favor a heavily distorted tone played at bone-crushing volumes - he is however, capable of some delicate playing as well.  John Wetton seems to favor taking the same approach on the bass guitar and his thunderous bass lines rumble throughout - like Fripp, John is also capable of some fairly delicate playing.  I was also happy to hear David Cross and his delicate violin/viola parts emerge from the chaos - unfortunately, his playing really took a back seat on the follow-up album Red (1974).<br /><br />The eight tracks on the album range in length from 3'46 to 11'14\\" and include a few studio tracks (The Great Deceiver and Lament) and the aforementioned live tracks.  Although some of the live tracks generate enough raw explosive power to blow the earth up ten times over, Trio is a very tranquil piece that just features violin, bass guitar, mellotron, and flute.  Apparently, Bill Buford felt that Trio was perfect as it was and decided not to add drums during the live performance - in fact, the band appreciated this gesture and gave him a co-credit.  The Night Watch is another quiet and mellotron saturated piece that breaks things up nicely.  Although the studio tracks are nice and present a wide range in dynamics, it is the crushing volume and avant-garde tendencies of the improvised tracks that really hold my attention.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good album released during a very creative period for King Crimson along with Lark's Tongues in Aspic (1973) and Red.  Although I can't say that I like this album as much as the other two from this period, this is still high quality progressive rock and is recommended along with In the Court of the Crimson King (1969); Lizard (1970); Lark's Tongues in Aspic; and Red.Great Deceiver and Lament) and the aforementioned live tracks.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|I'm hooked on this director right now. I watched The Hidden Fortress first and decided to buy Seven Samurai after being blown away by the directing of the movie. <br /> <br />Seven Samurai is all it is blown up to be. The detail of character development was right on. The story was simple and yet it kept you interested and excited for the full 3+hours that it lasted. The fight scenes weren't as violent as i expected it to be, but the skills were all there. fantastic cast. I'm going to get more of this directors movies now. Red Beard has caught my eye...

0887307280|5.0|One of the best assignments I had in college was to read this book. Class after class in business school we were analyzing large corporations and working case studies on them. When my professor decided to focus on small businesses, many folks in the class were upset, after all, it is much harder to deal with a small firm. In fact, our professor set us up with real small businesses through the SBA.  <br /> <br />The main reason I love this book is that it is really simplistic, yet most of us don't think in simple terms. We feel that if we are not doing everything that things will fall apart. Whether it is our own business or a team we are managing, the most important thing to do is develop employees to learn new skills. I have worked with managers that had to do everything on their own; I have also worked with managers that delegated everything out. It was not a very successful work environment because people were not learning the nesessary skills.  <br /> <br />Reading this book may not make a person a great manager, but it will give you the insight and awareness to help.
B00005JMEW|5.0|My first viewing of this volume in the Kill Bill saga occurred at two in the morning, as I suffered from severe insomnia. I was desperate, hoping that it would help me drift off. Unfortunately, or rather, fortunately, this film did anything but. The action, cinematography, and witty script blew me away; I loved it. The next day, however, I was surprised to learn that many people I knew did not feel the same way as I did regarding this flick. Willing to form a better opinion of the movie and shrugging the fact that I loved it off to simply being overtired, I watched it again.<br /><br />I still loved it. And herein was where I realized that this film is not for everyone. As it is a homage film, a tribute to Spaghetti Westerns and Kung-Fu flicks, one must look from this perspective. I myself enjoy these genres of film and lapped up Tarantino's unique and witty take on them. It is apparent (as it is in most of his work) that he is a great fan as well.<br /><br />As mentioned numerous times by others, there is gore abound here. Ridiculous violence, blood spurting everywhere, and bodies flying constantly. But somehow Mr. Tarantino, and you may call him sick or twisted  for it, made all the slicing and dicing humorous and never too serious, witty lines and funny visuals all the way through. True cinematic genius in my book.<br /><br />On the surface it looks like a senselessly violent revenge movie, but underneath it is far more. Like most of Tarantino's films, Kill Bill is riddled with culture references and contains a wonderfully varied soundtrack; absolute joy for the pop culture buff. It is a cleverly written, and the wonderful talent of all involved is clearly exhibited.<br /><br />On to the acting, Uma Thurman is a true standout. Prior to this film I hadn't thought much of her, even believing her to be overrated. This one role of hers changed my opinion completely. Thurman is brilliant as \\"The Bride\\"; her piercing eyes and intense persona portray a woman out for revenge amazingly. Lucy Liu is also impressive as a cold Yakuza headlady, and Vivica A. Fox and Daryl Hannah both provide great supporting roles as well.<br /><br />Overall this film is most definitely not something that everyone will go for- in fact, most will find it odd for the first ten minutes or so, but stick with it. This film is one of the most brilliant in recent years, even though it might not hit you with its depth right away. Highly recommended.<br /><br />**By the way, make sure to buy Volume 2 along with your purchase of Volume 1- the films were intended to be one but due to time constraints two were made, as you see them now. It will add for a more complete viewing experience, not to mention the cliffhanger at the end of the first.t for revenge amazingly.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I'm sure you've read other reviews that agree with me, so I'm not going to go into detail about everything that was totally wrong with these versions. For the star wars nerds out there who support these versions and those horrible prequels, let me ask you something. Say hypotheticly, goer verbinski (director of \\"pirates of the caribbean\\") decides to make a prequel of that trilogy and he hires Ashton Kutcher to play jack sparrow, he then decides that the prequel would \\"mesh\\" better with the original trilogy if johnny depp wasn't in them, so he decides to replace johnny depp in the original movies with ashton kutcher. Then, Gore decides that he doesn't want to seem \\"racist\\" so he hires a black woman to replace kiera knightly in the original trilogy...now, let me ask you...would you be happy with that?

B00005JPAO|5.0|Apparently the British public is just as foolish over the cult of celebrity as the U.S. I put Diane in about the same category as those other one name wonders like Paris or Brittany or Lindsey. Whatever she was, it was totally as the result of being the wife of the next king of Britain & the mother of the heir, with a spare. Those pseudo-mourners who hate the royals need to remember without a monarchy, Diane would have been a cute, kindergarten teacher from a prominent family. Her charitible works, eliminating land mines, helping people with AIDS could have been done by anyone if given her oppotunities. The first one, marrying into the royal family & the second, sleeping with the son of one of the richest men in the world. That royalty should even exist as parasites on the British people, the fact is they do. Therefore the people demanded the Queen grieve as they did. Give her grandsons up to be viewed & pitied. It was not her way. Helen Mirren was dead on as the Queen, as was Michael Sheen as the PM, Tony Blair. Always the politician, Blair was instrumential in convincing the Queen into making a statement concerning Diane's death, as he did. The monarchy does move toward modernity at glacial speed. The evolution from the Queen Mum, to Elizabeth, to Charles is evident in this movie. He considers himself a modern man. Even 10 years ago...not. His son, William also a future King, is. Although this movie takes place in a short period of time in 1997 you get a lot of inside information on the monarchy & the life of Elizabeth II. I think she is loved, & respected as maybe representing not the way things are but once were. Maybe not such a bad thing. If you're an Anglophile, watch the commentary version after the movie.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Stop what you are doing and buy this album right now.  No really.  Right up there ^^ Just order it.<br /><br />I am a Wilco fan that was hooked by \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", and have been enamored with everything since.  \\"Summerteeth\\" - ngeh.  I listen to it because it is smart and relaxing but I don't love it.  I hated \\"A Gohst is Born\\" on first spin but became quite impressed with it on subsequent spins and eventually grew to love it.  I streamed a couple of tracks pre-release from \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" and wasn't thrilled - It seemed bland and watered down.  Now that I own it and have given it several spins, I find that I am loving it.  The addition of Nels Cline is brilliant - he is a master and exhibits a strong technical interpretation of Tweedy's rhythmic drone.  I had read that the album was \\"simple\\" and \\"roots-y\\" -and certain tracks are - but there are some complicated arrangements (a-la Steely Dan, maybe?).  And some rock.  Yay!  All in all - a really listenable disc.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|A must see for all James Bond fans as well as new converts. Immensely well done starting sequence and realistic fight scenes make this the most plausible Bond installment. Weak points include a rather draggy romantic sequence towards the end. Overall, a very well done Bond movie with a refreshing take on the Bond franchise. Can't wait for the sequel.

141694740X|4.0|Ok, so some of the examples in the book are so obvious that if you need someone to tell you he's not into you....you may need a whole lot of other books I can think of.  <br />But, the attitude and in your face approach of this book is fantastic.  <br />Sometimes, women tend to overanalyze, and in that we can turn any situation into a most positive ones. We're the masters of fooling ourselves. Here, this books lays it out very honestly. It will have you laughing, but will also have you nodding your head. If something steers you to this book- you might have a premonition, and yep, he's not that into you....Behrendt pulls down the curtain and makes us see what is there, and what is not. It's the perfect book to kick start you, or slap you in the face to let you know that you are worth finding someone who is. It's a very helpful book to help us girls escape and all to often trap that sometimes we simply create ourselves.

0380778556|5.0|Great plot, writing, characterization, mood, suspense aside, the book, written only a few years before I was born, pulls the curtain back on the way I looked at womanhood, men and marriage as a young girl--and how different it was even then to today.  The heroine's shyness, her inability to speak her mind, her desire to live in denial of unpleasantness and do nothing about it echoes the way I recall thinking this is the way a woman should live--allow the men in my life indeed, allowing my interpretation of the words and actions of those men--to define what that life should be.<br /><br />And can you imagine putting up with Mrs. Danvers today?  Or placing the flowers where Frith says the first Mrs. did?<br /><br />As a widow having married a widower, I know how unhelpful it is to try to bury the past--to pretend someone never lived while imagining just about every detail.<br /><br />But then, the heroine's overactive imagination drove the plot, and that device is what makes DuMaurier so good. Who among us doesn't create the reality we respond to?

Those are the first two songs then song three comes on and it's like your transported to another world. Hip hop? RAP? what the hell is this. Gwen What happened. Do you even remember the no dought days? What a major disapointmet this cd was. We liked you the way you were. Try again gwen.

B000002KIT|4.0|Live and Dangerous was a revelation for me; although I have always enjoyed Thin Lizzy's studio recordings, I never appreciated how powerful a band they were until hearing them live.  The twin guitar attack led by Scott Gorham really shines on these tracks, and Phil Lynot's voice is in fine form.  This album definitely ranks high on my list of the greatest live rock albums of all time.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to the poor sound quality of the CD, which was disappointing.
1596590688|3.0|The CD version of the book was okay.  Some good ideas sprinkled throughout the book but a fair amount of repetition of the same ideas.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I really looked forward to seeing this, and was not disappointed.  I still think my favorite Rochester is Orson Welles, but this version is much more accurate than the 1940's version with Welles and Fontaine.  Ruth Wilson is spectacular and so is Toby Stephens.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|Thanks, Wilco! I recommend this album to both new and old fans of Wilco. This batch of songs are very easy on the ears, and the best part is that it makes you yearn to hear their older material like Being There and the Mermaid Avenue albums with Billy Bragg. I'm still a huge fan of Yankee Foxtrot Hotel, but was a bit lost with A Ghost is Born. This album finds them back in shipshape form with oft times sullen down tempo works which I personally love. Very Soothing.

B000006TRV|4.0|I'm glad to see today's generation getting into The Wall.    I was a teenager in 1980 when this album came out. It blew me away. After  listening to Wish You Were Here, Animals, Dark Side of the Moon, Echoes, and their earlier music, I was amazed that the Floyd could top themselves again.    The only thing that disappointed me was the story. At first blush, I thought the story of epic alienation was about an ordinary guy. I thought it shouldn't apply to a rock star. Since when has a rock star ever elicited sympathy anyway? How much of the population has ever been lonely at the top? Most of us scurry at the bottom, enduring the kind of alienation that comes from being \\"nobodies.\\" It's this kind of pain I can relate to, not the pain of isolation that comes from being more successful and famous than anyone else.    Anyway, the music is constantly gripping, even if it reeks of self-pity at times. The movie is psychedelic and wonderfully animated. This album is an undeniable classic, even if it is ocassionally overwrought. I've listened to it hundreds of times, and I'm sure I'll listen to it hundreds of times more.    Enjoy!

B00004XONN|1.0|...because Kid A isn't just an album.   Kid A is the benchmark album that separates the people who love music from the people who think that their love and \\"understanding\\" of music makes them superior to everyone else.  I would love to know the number of people who absolutely hate this album but won't admit it.   Music snobs agree..to admit that Kid A sucks is to admit that you don't \\"understand\\" the artful mind of Radiohead.    <br /> <br />Well, I am admitting it here.   Kid A isn't just a pretentious and boring album of electronic noise.   It's a slap in the face to those of us who were fans of the guitar-driven rock of The Bends and Ok Computer.    <br /> <br />I have Propellerhead's reason program.  And by using only the Rhodes MK II electric piano sound and the programmable drum machine, you can accurately reproduce songs like Everything in it's right place in minutes.  It's isn't brilliant.  And just because it's Radiohead doesn't mean it's good. <br /> <br />Step up people.   It's ok to hate this record.  And it's ok to admit it.
1594489505|5.0|I loved 'The Kite Runner' and was overwhelmed by Mr. Hosseini's new saga of people and life in Afghanistan.  His characters are so real and his prose is amazing.  How do people survive this terror and torture?   How can we read it without guilt and heartache?.  How can we read it without loving and being totally won over by the women who are so exceptional.  I cried and was heartbroken.  An exceptional novel.  You can never do better than this one, Mr Hosseini.
068484267X|5.0|I really can't say much more - it was just an outstanding story in every way.  The sadness of McCourt's childhood losses, deprivation and poverty took me to the depths of sympathetic grief, but then his perseverence and triumphs provided great inspiration.
1594489505|3.0|With \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", Khaled Hosseini follows up his best selling \\"The Kite Runner\\" with another glimpse at a battle torn Afghanistan. This time around, Hosseini focuses on the lives of two seemingly unrelated women who end up with a lifelong connection with each other. Mariam has no choice as she is given away to Rasheed, whose cruelty knows few bounds, while the younger Laila lives somewhat ideally before her family become casualties of the war, and she ends up as a wife of Rasheed as well. The book takes place over a number of years as new lives begin and old ones are lost, not to mention the fact that the book follows the same formula that \\"The Kite Runner\\" did before it. Rasheed, while cruel and symbolic of the Taliban that takes power, is given no kind of character development at all. We know that he is a bad man who believes he is just in his proceedings, which makes him all the more two-dimensional. There is also the fact that, while frequently compelling, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is as frequently predictable in its series of events. Without giving too much away, one character's would-be demise and return can be seen coming a mile away, along with other numerous elements as well. All that being said, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a bit more enjoyable than Hosseini's previous \\"The Kite Runner\\", and once again he manages to give we readers another glimpse of a world that we know little about but frequently condemn and discard. However, if you were one of the many that for some reason absolutely loved \\"The Kite Runner\\", chances are that you'll love this as well.
0517548232|2.0|I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that. <br /> <br />It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):  <br />'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.' <br /> <br />That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.  <br /> <br />And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics.

1582701709|1.0|You thought drinking orange juice after you freshly brushed your teeth left a bad taste in your mouth? Apparently you haven't experienced The Secret. Taste is a bad analogy as it implies harmlessness. Rather, reading this book (or watching the DVD for that matter) is akin to having your eyes carved out with rusty spoons. It is patronizing, insulting to the intelligence of anything more intellectually inclined than a tortoise. Actually that's being somewhat insulting to the tortoise. Its written simply, in the most bulleted, childish, infomercial-ist way possible. Basically, the WORST get-rich-quick scheme I've ever seen. And so conspiracy-esque that I wouldn't be surprised to see Tom Cruise show up in the credits, partnered with M. Night Shamylan. And ... my favourite claim of the novel is, by far, the idea that non-Western cultures are poor and disadvantaged simply because they have not had the audacity to pick up and read Byrne's book. A little harsh don't you think?<br /><br />Please don't waste your money ... you're better off buying Paris Hilton's book - this one makes her look like the next Salman Rushdie.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|It would have been quite easy for these filmmakers to have allowed themselve to get bogged down with unnecessary causation. This is a brilliant story and character piece and throwing in a magic pen or typewriter would have been a waste of time and energy.<br /><br />As it is, the plot and audience is saved from a pointless chase piece that would result as people chase a magic object and presented with a brilliant film that is both reaffirming and enjoyable.

0393061310|5.0|I started reading this book as a curiosity only to find out later that it was to be one of the books of my life. It blows up the myth of race superiority or even cultural superiority. In a thorough, detailed, and visionary investigation, the author shows how the environment in which a society develops determines to a large extent the future course of the society. Everyone who wants to understand how cultural, societal, and economic differences come about should read this book. No wonder it won the Pullitzer Prize.
B00005JM02|4.0|This movie will work well with my Spanish students.  It is a story they may know and one they will enjoy. It provides a good listening to the target language experience for them. Product was in great shape.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|I thought that the film was a very close representation of the novel.  It clearly depicted Fitzgerald's ideas.  The cahracters from the book were well represented by the actors.  Sam Waterson played Nick very well.  He remained simple but was helpful and a good friend.  The imperssion you got of Nick in the novel was the same in the film.  He was not overly judgmental and basically just an observer.  Robert Redford looked and played the part of Jay Gatsby.  His semi-deceitful demeanor was clear but not overemphasized.  It was interseting that there were some differences with his parts of the movie and the book.  They were obvious if you read the book.  As for Tom, Bruce Dern was sophisticated, stuck up, hypocritical, jealous, and posessive.  He was a perfect imitation of Mr. Buchanon.  Even his facial features and posture gave the air of superiority.  The actress who played Daisy did a good job of showing Fitzgerald's character's seeming flightiness but somewhat deceptive manner.  She was a key actress in the film.  Daisy was a very complicated character and would be hard playing her in the movie.  I was somewhat thrown off by Jordan's character, however.  She was nicer and more honest than I thought she would be.  I think that if F Scott Fitzgerald was casting the movie, he would have used the same cast.  They understood the character's in the novel and successfully transfered it on screen.  The task was hard because they had to put Fitzgerald's written analysis into dialogue throughout the movie.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this on spec, having seen none of it on television. My son (nearly 5) is rather keen on understanding the Earth better and this video has been an unbelievable education - for all of us. I still recall \\"Life on Earth\\", which Attenborough narrated when I was a child, so it has come full circle. <br /> <br />We're only 2 discs in so far, and it is absolutely amazing. I cannot pick a favourite part, rather there are no bad ones! I cannot even begin to cite what I've learned, nevermind what my son has taken from it, the insight is nearly as rich as the cinematography. I especially like the diary feature, which keeps the main story whole, and also allows for deeper appreciation of what the trackers, film crews et al went through to make this documentary.  <br /> <br />This represents an outstanding achievment, as well as a time capsule of our planet for generations to come. Well worth the fee!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I've always been fascinated by hallucinations.  So this movie naturally appealed to me.  It made me think, \\"My gosh, what if I'm like this guy and I've had a friend who isn't real all along?\\"  Holy cow.  Spooky.<br /><br />And the worst thing about it is the guy's hallucinations never go away.  He just has to pretend they aren't there.  What a bummer.  And some of those hallucinations were his best friends at one point too.  Geez.  Star Trek The Next Generation could do six full-length episodes based on the content of this film alone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in psychology, philosophical logic, insanity, or any combination of the three.  It can present you some mysteries, that's for sure.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Linkin Park went from good to great with their release of their second album Meteora. This album has traces of Meteora - yet it is seeded with this totally downbeat slow tempo songs and Nickleback type of rock sound. <br /> <br />I say there are about 4 songs that are good Linkin Park. The album feels totally incomplete, as if they did not have enough time or desire to make a couple of more good songs. I say; 4 more good songs along with an intro/outro would make this album a 10 song hit. Oh-well... $12 in my pocket.  <br /> <br />BTW: 'In between' - I don't consider that a song. The dude just talks you through the song. It is not singing.
B000I5X80G|5.0|I also have the 2-10-70 bootleg and feel that a comparison is in order to appreciate this Fillmore show.  Neil's very intimate with the crowd at the Cincinatti show, but frustrated at times, even asking two people to be quiet so he can \\"get into it\\" for the rest of the audience.  Then, at the beginning of the electric set Neil complains about a shock that he's getting from the equipment, and in the middle of \\"Down by the River\\" (18 minutes long!) he clearly says \\"I quit\\" during the chorus.  So, that show is not going to be one of his favorites even if the music is amazing.  It is a shame that this Fillmore release is missing the acoustic set and the ubiquitous \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" closer, which I heard was not as well preserved.  However, what is here is the best sounding live Neil you have ever heard!  It's not just the quality of the recording, either, which is rich, but the band itself.  Let's take the \\"River\\" as our vehicle of comparison.  Neil's voice has more inflection, his solos are more varied and aggressive, and despite being 12 minutes long it is a superior version.  Also, instead of \\"It Might Have Been\\" from Cincinatti we get \\"Cowgirl\\" which blows the studio version away.  Obviously, Neil felt better at the Fillmore show, so don't question the Master and treat yourself.
B000MXPE74|5.0|This is  great CD. I had heard a few of their singles from a friend but i didn't think that the whole album would be just as great. If you've heard and liked any of the Fratellis' music, buy this album. You'll love it.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|In 1975, beach communities all over suffered because of a shark attack. No, not a real shark attack, because they do not happen very frequently, at least not in this country. Jaws killed alright. He killed business down by the beach. Spielberg is one of the great directors of his generation. The special effects were cutting edge at the time. Great movie to watch around Halloween time as well.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I loved this series. We watched it as a family and it was so refreshing to be excited by nature and not by the shock jocks of Hollywood for a change. I would highly recommend this series to everyone.

0786838655|5.0|This book caught my eye when I was looking for something for my 12 year old son to get him interested in Greek mythology.  We love fantasy, Harry Potter, etc.  I read the book and LOVED IT.  Great action, funny, fun characters and darned if Riordan doesn't get mythology in there too! After my son got a concussion and couldn't read, I read it aloud to him, and he had so much fun he could forget the pain.  My 15 year old daughter overheard a chapter, pronounced \\"I have GOT to read that book!\\" and tore through it in a day.  I have just finished reading the second book in the series aloud because we all three wanted to read it at the same time! I have recommended The Lightning Thief to several friends with kids of varying ages - and all have loved it.  I love the angle of having the heroes saddled with dyslexia and ADHD, and explaining them as having a mind hard-wired for Greek, and battle-ready reflexes.  It gets kids thinking that maybe things we think of as \\"problems\\" might be just a different way of thinking that doesn't fit today's expectations. . .  and you can be smart and have these things.  My son's middle school class is now reading the book, and every single kid in the class is hooked!  Try it, I guarantee you will have a fun read.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is a perfect movie for a father to watch with his son. It is helpful in trying to explain what morality is to a child and why it is important to be honest. Errol Flynn is a great actor, but I particulary like the supporting actor Basil Rathbone of Sherlock Holmes fame. He plays an excellent villain as the sheriff of Nottinham and Claude Raines was superb as the false king. Olivia de Havilland was a superstar actress at the time this film was made as well. This is absolutely classic cinema. Highly recommended.
B000MZHW40|3.0|The movie was good, but hard to watch.  The way human life had no meaning, what rebels did to the boys to brain wash them, made this movie hard to watch.  It had a good plot line, but it was too believeable for me.  Fast paced, didn't figure it out a head of time, really cared about the characters.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This was one incredible season!!!  Always on the edge of your seat!!  Too bad they killed off the father.  I hope they can get Dean out of the deal he made with the devil for the upcoming third season!!  Jensen Ackles is the best character on the show!!! He totally rocks!!  All the episodes were mind-bending, and one thrill of a ride!!  I just can't wait until I can add it to my collection!!
B000NVIGC0|2.0|I give this new Wilco album credit for being so helpful with my insominia. I can play this album and get the best sleep I have had in months. Thanks Wilco!  I have been a great fan of Wilco from their first albums and up until the last two had great music value so I'm glad to see they are going for the customers who need sleeping aids now.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I have loved this movie for years--I rented it on a lark back in the late 90s and fell in love with it, cheesy dialogue and all. What gets me is the very last scene when they dance the paso. I can't help but sit at the edge of my chair with a goofy grin on my face.
B00005JPFH|4.0|To start off this review, I'd like to give a brief plot synopsis:  Peter Parker's got the girl, got the old friend back, got the fame (as Spidey), and got no problems.  Then, petty criminal Flint Marko (who's got no money but does have a really sick daughter) gets some sandy powers and uses them to his advantage.  Then, Peter gets some galactic goo on his Spidey suit and gets more power (think HGH for superheroes).  It all goes to Peter's head and then he loses the girl, loses the old friend (but gains back an enemy), loses the fame, and takes on a ton of problems which include (but aren't limited to) competing photographer Eddie Brock.  It all sounds sort of like a very long and jumbled country song, doesn't it?  Well, in all honesty, that's sort of what this film is.<br /><br />The film starts with Peter on top and then he is taken down hard, very hard, by co-screenplay writer/director Sam Raimi and screenplay writers Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent.  Sam Raimi does an excellent job with this film considering the massive amount of subplots that this story deals with seemingly all at once.  He develops the new villains of Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) as best as he can.  He also tries to bring to a close the love triangle of Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osborne.  He also throws in a bit of jealousy between Peter and MJ via the introduction of Gwen Stacey.  We also get to catch up with Aunt May and Jonah Jameson.<br /><br />The story is held together rather well so long as it's just Spidey either fighting with Sandman or the new Goblin.  Heck, even Peter Parker's lovelife makes a little bit of sense so long as it's just him, MJ, and Harry.  Things don't get messy until Gwen Stacey and her boyfriend/photographer Eddie Brock enter the fray.  That's where the train leaves the tracks.  It's the same old song and dance as what happened to the \\"Batman\\" franchise once the Catwoman and Penguin were coupled together to cause problems for Batman.  The movie becomes rushed, characters are dealt with too quickly in order to make room for other characters, and plotlines are tied up too neatly or just left by the wayside.  That's the major problem of this film.<br /><br />Had Venom/Eddie Brock (played by Topher Grace) been left out of this film, it would have been perfect.  Instead, we get a second-rate, rushed treatment of the Venom character and Eric from \\"That 70's Show\\" with an attitude and muscle to back it up.  Every time Brock popped up on the screen (with or without his symbiote companion), all I could think of was Eric getting razzed by Kelso or beat up by Donna.  Grace was miscast for this part.  He's not a bad actor.  It's just that Eddie Brock is played out too closely to Grace's Eric Foreman character from \\"That 70's Show.\\"  Gwen Stacey is easy on the eyes and does a decent job of stirring things up between Peter and MJ, but the character doesn't belong in this film either.  It would have been much better had she and Eddie Brock been removed from the film completely.  In fact, Sam Raimi admitted that early on he didn't want Venom in this picture.  It was only after a little nudging from producer Avi Arad that he came to like the character's addition to the story.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is outstanding.  Spiderman's battles with the new Goblin and Sandman are excellent and rival the brutal confrontations that Spidey had with Doctor Octopus in the second \\"Spiderman\\" flick.  They beat the heck out of each other.  The special effects are very good and Sandman's action scenes channel \\"The Mummy\\" with all the dust flying around.  I even enjoyed Peter Parker's \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" foray.  I found it to be quite funny, although it did run just a tad bit too long.<br /><br />The cast, excepting Topher Grace, was wonderful.  Tobey Maguire has a solid hold on the character of Peter Parker and much like Christopher Reeve as Superman, he'll be the only person worthy of being the Webslinger.  Dunst does an excellent job as MJ.  James Franco, despite having to struggle for screentime with Sandman and Venom, does a good job as Harry Osborne/New Goblin.  His character, in my opinion, developed the most in the second film and he carries that development over to this sequel well.  With little character development Church still manages to pull at the heartstrings as Sandman.  His character is given only a basic treatment so that we only understand why he's a criminal and why his fate in the film is what it is.  Bryce Dallas Howard does a good job as the airheaded Gwen Stacey.  The rest of the cast, including Sam Raimi stalwarts Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi, do excellent jobs with their limited rolls.<br /><br />So why four stars?  For the simple fact that this really is an excellent film considering how much information is processed in its 140-minute runtime.  Other than the unnecessary villain cluster that hampers the tale, \\"Spiderman 3\\" plays well as an action yarn and even as a moral story of personal responsibility over selfish acts.  If a fourth film is made (and I seriously doubt that Maguire or Raimi will be returning), I hope that Spidey's villain count is lowered to one.  If you enjoyed the other \\"Spiderman\\" films, you'll enjoy this one.  It loses its way here and there but is, overall, a very good action film.e having to struggle for screentime with Sandman and Venom, does a good job as Harry Osborne/New Goblin.

0743298020|5.0|When I first started to read this book, I will admit it did bore me a little. For at first I thought it was somewhat of a romance novel; delving into the world of Maragret Lea. Margaret is a self proclaimed loner who relates more to books than people. <br />But as you continue to read, the one statment that resonates throughout the book is \\"Tell me the truth.\\" This statement could have been the title of the book. for it is this that sends you literally on a roller coaster ride as Margaret herself unwittingly plays detective as she tries to guard herself from secrets being hidden from her once again. <br />Diane Setterfield has done a wonderful job in creating characters that entice you into learning about them and their own story. It will leave you wanting to know numerous times, the truth.
B000O178BY|4.0|The first time I listenend to the CD I was like \\"what's going on??\\" But the more I listend to it the more I liked it. Its a Brilliant CD. A defenite must for every NIN Fan..
B000O178BY|4.0|I've heard a lot of people complaining about this record.  I think the reason they want to complain is because they have preconceived notions about what NIN is supposed to sound like, and in this case their ideas didn't hit the nail quite on the head.  I personally like the record, it is far, far simpler than previous works by Trent but still shares identifiable similarities.  I think possibly he was going for a less is more quality specifically so the listener is more likely to walk away from it having understood what he had to say rather than what the drum machine sounded like!  You don't have to agree with me but I personally enjoyed it and listened to it at least 2 dozen times in the first week alone.  Sometimes change is interesting!

B000NVIXFK|4.0|THE BAND: Geddy Lee (vocals, bass, mellotron), Alex Lifeson (guitars, mandolin), Neil Peart (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 13 tracks clocking in at approximately 62 minutes. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, odd pictures that fit with the song titles, and thank you's. Recorded at Allaire Studios (Shokan, NY). All songs written by Lee and Lifeson, with lyrics by Peart (except the instrumental \\"Hope\\" by Lifeson). Studio album #18. Label - Anthem / Atlantic Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: The bass guitar and drums stand out on \\"Snakes & Arrows\\". Lost in the shuffle, unfortunately, is Alex's guitar. Lifeson is such a talented guitarist... I miss hearing his blazing solos (thus making me think that his best work in 2007 is on Porcupine Tree's \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\"). Lee's synthesizers are still gone - for the most part, I think that's a good thing (synthesizers are fine as long as they're not stealing the show). Does anyone else feel the same way as I - that Geddy Lee needs to turn down his bass guitar? In my opinion, \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" still sounds like newer Rush than old. Those hoping for another \\"Hemispheres\\", \\"Permanent Waves\\" or \\"Moving Pictures\\" might be disappointed. The month of May ('07) found the disc at #1 on the Top Rock Album charts, and #3 on Billboard... the first hit being released \\"Far Cry\\" getting a fair amount of play. At this early point of its release, it's a guess as to what might be hit #2, because nothing jumps out right away. There are 3 instrumentals - the longest and most intricate being \\"The Main Monkey Business\\"; the shorter acoustic \\"Hope\\" from Lifeson; and the 2 minute \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" showing off Lee's bass. The heavier rock song highlights included \\"Far Cry\\", \\"Spindrift\\", \\"Workin' The Angels\\" and the slow trudging \\"Armor And Sword\\". One of the few power ballads (if you will), \\"The Larger Bowl\\" is good, but probably my least favorite track on the disc. Peart's lyrics are smart yet somewhat depressing, and dare I say less clever. This is a safe album - no bold statement being made - there's no \\"Spirit Of The Radio\\", \\"Red Barchetta\\", \\"Fly By Night\\", \\"New World Man\\" or even \\"One Little Victory\\" that will jump off the disc at you. Ultimately, could this be considered classic Rush? Probably not... simply no comparison to anything the band released between the classics \\"2112\\" and \\"Signals\\" (1976-1982). Seems to me Rush is showing their age and becoming less rock and progressive, and more contemporary. Lee's vocals seem labored and he just isn't hitting those exciting high notes anymore (or simply isn't given the chance). The album artwork is cool, but I actually think the back cover art is much more deserving to be on the front. I feel Lee/Lifeson/Peart have given us so many legendary songs over the past 30+ years, that this \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" will skate by on that fact alone. A good Rush album here, just not a classic (4 stars).t yet somewhat depressing, and dare I say less clever.

The Godfather is one of my favorite movies and I had hoped to add this selection to my DVD collection for many years to come.

It is unacceptable that my newest DVD purchase looks older and more run down than DVD's I've had for ten years.  I thought about returning the selection, but I had already opened the wrapper so why waste my time?

0805066691|5.0|No words I write here could do justice to this book.  If you want a true account of what happened in the 19th century Indian wars (which was actually attempted genocide) that has not been tainted by \\"political correctness\\"... that is not a white-washed retelling... then you've found it.  It should be required reading in our public schools nationwide. <br /> <br />The Indian wars were the result of the military being used by the narrow-minded, self-righteous and greedy as a means for advancing a political agenda.  This was a shameful time and the spoils of these wars were won by deception, starvation, and theft, not military might or honorable negotiation.  Many of the reservations were on lands that could not grow food, in areas where the buffalo and other animals had largely been scared away or hunted to near extinction by Anglo hunters.  They were forced to abandon their traditions and native culture in order to be \\"assimilated\\" by Anglo society, or become extinct themselves. <br /> <br />If you're looking for the \\"good vs evil\\" stereotype... such as that seen in countless Hollywood movies over the years... or the white-washed version of history as taught in most schools, then this book is not for you.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Theres not much I can add to what has already been said. However if by some miracle you've missed this film over the last 12 years then here is a quick overview of one of the best crime movies ever made.<br /><br />Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro star as respectively dedicated cop and master criminal. Pacino as Cop Vincent Hanna is so dedicated that he neglects his family and his 3rd marraige is falling apart. DeNiro as Neil McCauley is a man who is prepared to walk away from any relationship in order to maintain his criminal lifestyle. A previous reviewer gave the acting honours to Pacino, which I'd have to disagree with. Lets be clear here both are excellent, and I like both actors, they are amongst the best ever. But for my money DeNiro steals it in perhaps his last great performance. Pacino just overplays his part just a little bit, which allows me to give it to DeNiro - but only just.<br /><br />The remainder of the cast are excellent and Michael Mann directs with his usual skill. Some of the action sequences in this film are brilliantly done. I recently saw Mission Impossible III, which has some impressive action sequences in it but they aren't in the same league as the ones in this film. Why? Because Heat does not rely on CGI effects and the camerawork is vastly superior. Furthermore action sequences do not need to contain explosions every 30 seconds to make them work!<br /><br />This is quite a long film at 164mins but you will find that it passes very quickly - always the sigh of a good film.

0618680004|4.0|This book definitely succeeded in its stated goal of convincing me to accept my atheism. In the first chapter, Dawkins presents a scale of 1 through 7, 1 possessing certainty about the existence of God and 7 certainty of the non-existence of God. I realized I could only agree with 6; like Dawkins, I would have to respond, \\"Very low probability, but short of zero. De facto atheist. `I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there'\\" (51). While I found Dawkins' style extremely belligerent (for a mild example, a letter from the president of a historical society in New Jersey \\"damningly exposes the weakness of the religious mind...every sentence drips with intellectual and moral cowardice\\" (16-17)), I had difficulty finding holes in his arguments. However, his arguments certainly raised tough questions, and I am not sure I agree with his responses.  <br /> <br />For instance, he firmly believes it is child abuse to deny a child the right to think critically, but instead to teach unquestioning faith in authority, that teaching faith as a virtue is extremely detrimental and its exposure to youths should be outlawed. I also believe in critical thinking, and value that way of thinking about things above all others. For science, it is objectively a horrible mindset to believe in unexplainable mysteries and believe that some things ought not to be questioned. For society, it is extremely likely that a group of people taught to obey authority figures could be led to commit atrocities. At the same time, I am not so sure that our empirical mindset is unquestioningly better. Dawkins makes a good point that few people raised in our society (a well-educated, open-minded place, whether somewhere in England or America) would choose to live like the Amish, or in Saudi Arabia. Yet the Amish or Saudis who would choose to live in our society would necessarily have already accepted our paradigm- within their own, theywould not want to, just as within the standards of our society, we would not want to live in theirs. That we have more powerful and pervasive media than the Amish does not necessarily mean we are objectively \\"right.\\"  <br /> <br />Dawkins spends a lot of time talking about the need for the child to be able to choose. I just don't know how that could be achieved- either he/she would learn to believe in science (the scientific method, empiricism, believing in evidence), and therefore not believe Scripture, or learn to believe that truth is found in authority (sacred books, parental figures, priests), and therefore be unable to be convinced by empirical evidence. I personally believe it is much better for people to think critically and question authority, but I don't know if I believe that is objectively true- how could I prove it, without any source of ultimate morality, or what experiment could I do- so how could I force everyone else to accept my source of truth? In some cases (such as an army in war), questioning authority would objectively be detrimental.  <br /> <br />Part of Dawkins' complete faith in science is his optimistic assertion that there is no need for a separate realm for faith because, ultimately, everything is a scientific question that could be solved by science. There is no room for a God- the gaps in current scientific knowledge are continuously being filled, and the theologians' desire to leave some questions unanswered is detrimental to the scientific pursuit of knowledge, as well as hopeless. I agree that wanting less knowledge is not a positive view, but I don't believe that science can possibly answer everything. Accepting evolution by natural selection, accepting a scientific origin of the universe and of life, does not and cannot give any ultimate meaning or purpose to life. I am inclined to think there is none, but that answer, I think, is beyond the scope of science. I cannot think of a feasible experiment to demonstrate whether or notlife has any meaning, even though it is a yes or no question. Dawkins finds some meaning in the fact that we are lucky enough to be here, but that is just his opinion. I agree that theologians have no monopoly on coming up with answers to those sorts of questions, but they do have special knowledge of particular answers, and if people want to find the answers in one specific book or another, it is reasonable that they would turn to those most learned in such matters. Probably, anyone's answer is as good as anyone else's, but since I can't determine an experiment to determine which answer is scientifically true, I would not prevent anyone from seeking an explanation based on ancient documents that have withstood the test of time. I don't agree that everything can be answered by science, or that there is no room left for God, whether or not I personally believe in Him. <br /> <br />I found Dawkins' explanation of morality very unsatisfying, though understandably so from his point of view. He explained morality in terms of why it would have been evolutionarily useful. I agree with his explanation. I certainly agree that Christians act no more \\"Christian\\" than atheists, and that many horrible things have been done in the name of religion (though I don't agree with him that the world would have been much better off without it- I think wars of religion have used religion as an excuse, not that it has been the ultimate cause). However, he did not give any reason for why we should still act morally (altruistically, generously, compassionately), even though it was once, logically, evolutionarily advantageous and we still feel the urge to do so. He makes fun of people for fearing atheism because they don't think they, or others, would act morally without being supervised and having the threat of reward or punishment. To me, that is not the question he should have addressed: removing any idea of ultimate meaning or purpose, what is the value of a human life? How does one findmeaning in helping others, if humanity is just the current end product of a directionless process? For me, the danger in this mechanistic view of the universe lies not in its removal of a mind-reading punisher, but rather in the meaninglessness of it all. That we are the way we are because of impersonal mechanisms like natural selection is remarkable, but to me, it does not make my life or my actions meaningful, as I think I would feel if I could believe we had been put here for a purpose. Dawkins finds science an inspiration, but that is his personal opinion. In The God Delusion, his advocacy of fearless critical thinking about every topic left me searching for a convincing meaning of life that would stand up to such scrutiny; his inspiration by science did not sway me. His book allowed me to say that I am an atheist, but I understand why the religious might want to protect their children from such doubts, however cowardly that may seem.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Once again there have been comments that Hans Zimmer and director Gore Verbinski have relied on \\"film score by committee\\" for \\"Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End,\\" including some input by Verbinski himself on \\"Hoist the Colours,\\" and that is just fine because it all comes together with a full broadside both on the soundtrack recording and on the screen.  This is easily the best of the three \\"Pirates\\" scores, and may be one of the very best efforts by Zimmer.  To begin Zimmer integrates the main themes from the previous two films (and gives another tongue-in-cheek nod to Ennio Moricone), but he also presents a full fusillade of new themes.  He also goes back to the basics of a pretty much full orchestra treatment (with chorus) which is exactly what you want in a swashbuckler.  And indeed this is a fine swashbuckling and romantic effort from ominous beginning to heartrending end that runs right up the mizzen with Alfred Newman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner, and of late even James Horner.  This is a more complex and dynamic score than we have seen with the \\"Pirates\\" series that yields the necessary musical backdrop to a varied tapestry on the screen from the gallows hoisted in the Caribbean to Singapore (a great theme and treatment here), to the rolling seas (a soaring theme here especially in \\"What Shall We Die For\\"), with an amazing jig on a turning deck (\\"Up is Down\\") just for fun.  But it all comes together with a broad theme essentially for Elizabeth and Will.  Of course it frolics as well, Jack Sparrow is well represented musically and this provides the essential continuing thread that sews all of the film's tatters together, and may be setting the course for a fourth venture.  Beautifully produced (with a fair and representative amount of the score) and very nicely packaged by Walt Disney Records.
B000MZHW40|3.0|I liked a lot about the movie: the acting, scenery, subject matter. But at the end, it did not endear itself to me. The romance was unconvincing. The action sequences grant superman status to the stars. It felt like Cliff notes on recent African history.

0316018953|4.0|I always expect great things from Michael Connelly. His books never seem to disappoint. But as I started The Overlook, a short mystery that originated as as a serial in the New York Times Magasines, I started to think that Connelly wouldn't live up to my expectations this time around. But halfway through, the book becomes a real thrill ride that you won't want to get off of. <br /> <br />I am really tired of authors using 9/11 and terrorists as a topic for myseteries or thrillers. And The Overlook starts as such. A man is killed after having stolen highly radioactive materials from the hospital he works in. His wife has been left at home for dead, tied up naked on her bed. The only suspects are a terrorist group that is suspected to be in the area. The only witness? A Canadian teenager and Madonna stalker who may or may not be reliant. <br /> <br />Not only does he have to find the radioactive stuff before it is used to wipe off Los Angeles, Harry Bosch also wants to find the murderer before the FBI does. His ongoing vendetta against the Feds is put to test in this novel, and soon enough, he comes head to head with his past flame and partner Rachel Walling. Eventually, they will team up again and the good ol' Bosch will come back to the surface.  <br /> <br />Although the book is barely over 200 pages long, you get to learn a lot about Harry and Walling. Teamed with a new partner, Bosch seems a bit tired, bitter and overworked. His hard-headedness and his bad temper comes out in full force in The Overlook and sometimes even prevents him from making the right decisions. I love Bosch for this. He is flawed and real, and every book makes you learn something new about him. He is not like the other characters in serial novels, where you get tired of always reading about the same person and the same events from their past. Bosch is unique in that he always seems new and familiar all at once. <br /> <br />Although I am still waiting for the day when Connelly will write another masterpiece like The Poet, and although I would have liked The Overlook to be a bit more fleshed out and longer, the story served its purpose. It had me on the edge of my seat, and kept me guessing 'til the very end. Connelly has another winner on his hand.

B00000HZTB|5.0|Lou Reed-The Blue Mask *****<br /><br />The Blue Mask was released in 1982, this is at least 15 years into his career of making amazing music. After the death of his long time idol and mentor Delmore Schwartz who he studied under Reed decided to dedicate an album to him. That album turned out to be The Blue Mask, incidently this happens to be Reeds most mature and thought out album. With lyrics more thoughtful then ever before and much more personal then ever before or since if that is even possible.<br /><br />To this day, and even on the day of the albums release The Blue Mask is hailed by fans and critics alike as one of if not Lou Reeds all time greatest achievement as a solo artist. While this is one of his better solo records and sure as hell can rival some of his work with The Velvet Underground, The Blue Mask is not Reeds greatest triumph as a solo artist that would go to either New York or Berlin.<br /><br />However songs like 'The Day John Kennedy Died' and 'Underneath The Bottle' are easily to the best songs ever written. Rockers like 'Average Guy' and the albums closer 'Heavenly Arms' so a different side of Reed that was never shown before, Reed always boasted about confidence and cool and being self-reliant, these songs so fear, and longing for a connection a weaker, yet, more mature Reed, one that wasnt in the 1970's.<br /><br />As a whole, The Blue Mask is the most solid and concistant album Lou Reed ever recorded solo, and is in a league of its own. The Blue Mask is yet another Lou Reed solo album that is far superior to that of Transformer but will never get the recognition it deserves because of the hit single on Transformer, oh well as long as the real music fans know the truth.

B0000009SI|5.0|Frank Zappa-Apostrophe(') *****<br /><br />The first half of the album is sort of a concept album, well a mini-concept album about an eskimo named Nanook and all of his wild adventures. The second half of the album just plays out like a well polished jazz record with satire thrown in for lyrical content. Filled with some of the most outragiously satirical lyrics in Zappas cannon, and some of the most amazing guitar work ever heard or played mixed with some of the strangest sounds ever recorded but by this time the world had come to expect that from the genius that is Frank Zappa, and some how all of this madness managed to become a hit album. How you ask well lets see.<br /><br />By this time Zappa had earned much respect in the musician comunity and a large fan base because of his humor. By the time Apostrophe(') was released in 1974 the world had began to realize that listening to a Zappa album is like whitnessing a shock and awe mission and many were curious about it. With the large success and suprize radio air time of 'Dont Eat The Yellow Snow' Apostrophe managed to become a gold album, Zappas first of his career. The song had catchy lyrics, and a great melody, and not to mention the amazing guitar playing through out.<br /><br />The first two tracks 'Dont Eat The Yellow Snow' and 'Nanook Rubs It' are combined together as a single just title 'Dont Eat The Yellow Snow' which is another reason why this album is essntial and so cool because this is the way that it was ment to be heard.<br /><br />'Nanook Rubs It' is a bluesy song about the murdering of Nanooks favorite baby seal. 'St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast' plays out like some strange love at first sight with Tina Turner singing backup. 'Father O'Blivion' is a fushion jazz track that is just so out of this world that it must be heard to apreciate, this track ends the mini-concept album.<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with the Zappa classic 'Cosmik Debris.' This song has gone on to be a fan favorite appearing on almost all of Zappas post human compalation albums. 'Excentrifugal Forz' is just insane. Must be heard, and is truly one of the best songs that Zappa has ever written. The title track 'Apostrohe(')' is an amazing insrumental that contains some of the very best guitar playing ever recorded. 'Uncle Remus' starts out as a old time piano ballad, somewhat wild west-esq. Then it transforms into an all out guitar assualt on the ears. 'Stink Foot' is a song that not many feel is a highlight but that is just wrong, the song takes up a fifth of the 32 minute album, it is vital to the album and is perfect for closing an already great album.<br /><br />Aside from Zappas guitar playing which is amazing and prevalant through out the album he also wrote everything he himself did not play. All the background music is of his own writing. All the Xylaphone, drum, ect. are all written by Zappa so not only was he playing and singing along but conductiong as well.<br /><br />Apostrophe(') is an amazing album that no Zappa fan can not own and still call themselves a Zappa fan.

B00008BLB8|5.0|Having seen Grand Funk 5 times from 1970-75 which of course is the time of all the live recordings of them, I can tell you that this is the tale end of a great live band. Grand Funk was always known as a live band and they had many problems selling their studio albums for that reason. Having seen the down and raunchy to the \\"we are getting tired of doing this\\" concerts, it is a great story and I still listen with wonder to the live recordings reliving the idea that I was deaf for 3 days after the concert in the Boston Gardens in 71-72 (hard to remember which year)and my friend Ronnie who after the third song laid down on the chairs (we were on the floor about 50 feet fromt he stage) closed her eyes and never got up again until the last song when I think she was able to handle the whole thing again. The last time I saw them was at the Hampton Roads Colisium in Hampton Virginia in 75 and was the culmination again of fan distress when one of the fans reached up and pulled the cord from Marks guitar as he was flying across the stage (again I was down front)caught up in Inside Looking Out and all the while shaking his head at the fan pleading for him not to pull it out, but he did anyway and of course prophetically that was the end of a great era. Greatest Live Rock band ever.  <br />

B000P6R6X8|5.0|I already had 4 or 5 promotional mp3s from this album and wasn't really going to buy it.  Those songs grew on me slowly and I thought they were a disappointing departure from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  Eventually I found myself listening to those songs several times a day. I'm glad I bought the full cd/dvd.  The songs I hadn't heard hit me quickly.  Yes, it is more stripped down than their last few but there is still that unmistakable Wilco blend of comfort and experimentation.  People like to point out the similarities they hear to other artists and that's cool - but in the end this is all Wilco.  Probably my favorite active band right now.  With this album, I feel they have proven they can do what they want and rank with the greats.  Their albums will be around 100 years from now.      I like Stephen B. Wright's observance in another review:  they can realease great albums each time out and still piss off a portion of their fanbase with each one.  For now, I'm a fan of all of it.    Regarding the DVD - I don't normally like interviews where the writers go on about everything they were thinking and blah blah blah.  It usually sounds a little corny and self-important.  Let the music speak for itself.  The interviews here are pretty good - not embarrassing. The performances, though, are the reason to get it. Good stuff .
B000G73UEU|5.0|If you saw the movie I'm Your Man about Leonard Cohen and enjoyed the music, then expect to feel similarly towards this CD.  There are a few songs that are missing from the movie, most notably Hallelujah sung by Rufus Wainwright in the show.     If you've never heard of Leonard Cohen, you are in for a new experience.  His lyrics are incredible - poetry of a kind we rarely hear these days.  His voice is only on this CD one time, in a spoken version of Tower of Song which is sung with U2 at the conclusion of the CD.    The variety of the types of songs keeps the listening fresh.  The musicians who cover the songs were unknown to me: (but very capable) -- Nick Cave, Anthony -  who sings a gorgeous \\"If it be your will\\" - Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Teddy Thompson and others. Track #15 called Anthem stands out as well.    This will appeal to those who know of and like LC, and if you enjoy folk rock, often acoustic, and exquisitely poetic lyrics.     Highly recommended
B000OCXFCO|3.0|Everyone knows what Megadeth was in the 80's, and early 90's.  We all, mostly, know of the radio friendly, but decent Cryptic writings, and the debacle that is Risk.  Since then it's been a steady climb back to what they should be.  Hero had a good sound, but the songs were mostly weak, plus a remake of an older Megadeth classic.  Something I'll complain about later.  Then we had The System Has Failed, and it had far better songs, but a worse, more Cryptic writings sound, the guitars were very toned down.  Which leads to this album.    I kind of hate it when bands go on with only 1 or no original members, but Megadeth for the longest had only 2 main members anyways.  It took me a while, but I finally accepted this and moved on.      Overall this is a decent addition to the Megadeth catalog.  The production is solid, and the music, and Dave's vocals sound great.  This is one of the better sounding Megadeth albums.  I wish and thought, after Endgame, they'd keep this lineup, there was one member change from this to that album, but overall it was mostly the same lineup.  But if Ellison has come back I guess I can't really complain too much.     Overall this is a decent album.  there aren't that many songs that really grab me, but that's also true for the next album too.  Still for the most part the songs are pretty good.  I do have to add why the hell was Black Swan left off for the remake of A tout le monde?  I don't care if they wanted to redo the song.  I have the original, far superior verson, so I don't have to worry about listening to that garbage, and won't dignify it with a full review.  This along with Return to hanger, from Hero, really show Dave must have some rela songwritting issues at this point, and want to keep something to stand out amongst the ok songs.  So, he takes Megadeth classics, and remakes them.  God why not just make a remake album, where he can do all the rerecording he wants?  Then I wouldn't have to hear it even once.  But, as it is, theyput this throw away song on here instead of a decent song, I threw on my compilation I entitled Risk.  Mix of b sides and the few songs from Risk I liked, or thought were tolerable.  Also not a fan of the Megadeth logo on the cover of this one.  It's the worst logo since the original Risk cover.    Sleepwalker 7/10 - This song starts off with a clean intro, not dissimilar to something Metallica might do.  Then it builds into an up tempo rocker.  Not a big fan of the backing vocals of \\"sleepwalker\\", and the lyrics kind of suck.  But the music is solid.  The vocals on the verses, and build up to the chorus are fine.  Overall it's ok, but it lacks something which keeps me from loving this song, which is sad cause the intro seemed like it was building towards a REALLY good song.  Still a solid track though.    Washington Is Next  8/10 - Another fast song, not a thrasher, but still good enough.  I like the drumming, and the guitar riffs.  Dave goes off on his political ranting.  Overall it's a decent song.  It's one of the highlights for me, but it's still missing a little something.    Never Walk Alone 7/10 - This one's slower than the last song.  It's still fairly up tempo, except the chorus is slower.  It's ok.  The chorus is actually slightly better, not much.      United Abominations  9/10 - This one starts off with some clean guitar notes, before Dave starts rambling.  Then the real song begins.  I love the guitar riff in the verses.  Dave's vocals and the rhythm section fills in nicely.  The lyrics are a bit annoying, Dave going off on the UN.  The lyrics about Iraq are annoying because they make this song, and I knew they would at the time it was released, seem dated.  Granted we're still there, and it's still a mess, but this is a music review not political debate.  The chorus is the best of the album.    Gears Of War 9/10 - This one feels more groove oriented.  It's another one of Dave's political songs, but if you've made it this far in the Megadeth discography, then you're use to it by now.  This one's a little slower, still not a slow song.  I like the guitar riff in this one tooo, and the chorus is decent too.    Blessed Are The Dead 8/10 - This one kind of builds.  Unfortunately the chorus is a little flat, but the guitars are still solid, so it's still an enjoyable listen.      Americanestan or however you spell that, 1/10 - the chorus is decent, from what I remember.  It's been years since I've listened to it.  I just remember instead of verses we get Dave rambling on and on and on about I don't know, nor do I care what.  Awful.  You mean to tell me this crap is better than Black Swan?  I know that's not the greatest song either, but come on.    You're Dead 6/10 - Meh, this is an ok song.  there really isn't anything that stands out about it, but there's not really anything horrible either about it.    Burnt Ice   6/10  - Why the coughing in the intro?  The verses remind me a little of a couple songs from Endgame, can't remember the names right now.  The chorus is a little weak.  An ok song, but nothing special.  There's also some fast soloing at the end.    Play For Blood  5/10 - this one's ok, but my least favorite out of the real songs, I'm excluding the crappy remake and Dave's ramble song.      Overall it's still a decent album, despite some glaring flaws.  And I really wish there'd been another couple standout songs, and no crappy remake of a previous song, but oh well.  This is what we were given at the time, and it only gets better with 2009's Endgame.  I just feel an album with this good of a sound deserves better songs, but at least most aren't bad.  This is definitely a must own for Megadeth fans though.
0061120073|5.0|Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the  reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.<br /><br />The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as \\"Francie\\" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.<br /><br />The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.<br /><br />This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages.
1594489505|5.0|Kabul jaan and Afghanitan, how I miss my homeland and my fellow Hamwatan Afghans. This story brought a great deal of memories of Afghanistan of my childhood, of friends and family I left behind during the war and of the forgotten life we led there. I can completely relate to Mr. Hosseini's powerful and heart felt tale. It is a prevailing story, filled with emotion, and artfully written. The story had my heart, soul, mind and even my dreams haunted until I finished it. I recommend the book to anyone who ever has had to go through hard times and could not see the future clearly. For those who lost hope and are not sure if there will be a promise of a better tomorrow.  For anyone who ever cared and wondered what it's like to have lived through, war, fear, hopelessness and uncertain times. If you liked the Kite Runner, you will also enjoy reading this book.

I'll go find the album, which has a wonderful warm tone I can still remember, 25 years later, because Ozzy was my God back in my early singing days, along with Ian Gillan. Seriously, I'm listening to this through headphones at the moment. Who the heck listens to this album for the drums or the bass? You're here For Ozzy and Randy. Drummers and bassists are just throw-away components in an Ozzy band. It's been that way since Ozzy stood on a stage for the first time with Tony Iommi.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|But not a horrible CD. Unfortunately, it didn't feel like Linkin Park. The previous albums were a sound that I couldn't place to any other group, but this CD seems to be a rehashing of the new emo/punk/political type of music. Most of the songs on this CD I can see coming out on the pop radio stations sometime, and very few of them on any rock station. The lyrics for the most part are boring and simple, as with the drums and melodies in general. There's little of the electronic feel that LP has shown in the past, which is a huge downer for major LP fans. If you don't think of this as LP, you might like it, but if you're looking for that amazing album that they have been talking about making for the last 5 years, this isn't it. One of the songs I can even say is Fort Minor, not LP. Good CD, just shouldn't be labeled as Linkin Park.
0596527055|4.0|Right? <br />Not really. In this book Scott does a great job debunking the commonly held myths about innovation in a witty, approachable style. If you've ever wondered how innovation happens, or how to improve the innovativeness and creativity of your team this book is worth a read. <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed the insight in chapter 4- people don't really love new ideas, but you'll find similar gems throughout the book. <br /> <br />I gave it only 4 stars, because after I'd finished reading the book I came away wanting something more (though lots of great references and links are provided) - perhaps more stories to get involved in, or just to enjoy Scott's humor for a while longer.  <br /> <br />Overall I recommend this book, you'll gain some new insights and a new perspective on your old ones.

AND it will send a message to help us bring Firefly back to launch a new and continued story to be back on TV.  or maybe have a new movie made!!! <br /> <br />anyway, it is wonderful. . .you will not waste you money. . .and you will be supporting some intelligent story lines for us to view again on TV or wherever.  MONEY TALKS, you know.  That's what the series needs now, your financial support. <br /> <br />I was never a Buffy fan, but I  am a HUGE FIREFLY FAN.  THIS IS GOOD GOOD STUFF.   <br />
B000NVIXFK|5.0|A great album by Rush.  More acoustic guitar and some interesting lyrical work.  I love it
6303444202|5.0|I remember MUSIC MAN well, from my childhood, when they used to air this on broadcast television, on a regular basis.  Particularly, it was one of those annual films you saw around the time of Fourth of July.  Robert Preston is the Music Man (the title character), a con artist who comes to the stern midwestern town of River City, promising to start a band for the youth, and bring the community together, through music.  Does he really have those intentions?  No, but what better way to turn a fast buck?  He even pursues the town spinster, librarian Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones).  Will this man of music and smoke and mirrors win over the heart of this uptight woman?You'll have to see this film and see how all of the plot twists turn out!  What's more, some of Meredith Wilson's best music is featured here (including \\"Seventy-six Trombones,\\" \\"Trouble in River City,\\" and \\"Gary, Indiana\\").  This film also features a very young Ron Howard (known now as an acclaimed and well-respected director and actor).  This is marvelous!
0201633612|4.0|10 years ago this book revolutionize the way programmers see object oriented programming. At that time, it was essential to read it. In fact, I remember that employers were testing candidate knowledge on design patterns at job interviews. Today, I consider this book as a classic that I would recommand to read for everyone that has just learned object oriented programming but it is less essential than it used to be as design patterns knowledge has spread in the litterature and you could even learn about them just by working on existing code.  That being said, this book is still very valuable even for people that already know about patterns. I am on my second reading after many years of using the design patterns and I am picking up new insights that has escaped my attention at the first reading.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Megadeth were one of the \\"big four\\" of the Bay area thrash-metal movement of the early '80s, bringing a welcome alternative to metalheads tired of the cheesiness and triviality of the hair/pop-metal bands prevalent of that era. Dave Mustaine and Co. have stuck around for years ever since, in various iterations, flying the metal flag regardless of musical trends, and they have certainly earned their place as one of the most influential and important metal bands ever. After reaching their pinnacle with the unbelievably intense, hyper-technical prog-metal-tinged masterpiece, \\"Rust In Peace\\", their subsequent releases became less and less heavy and complex, and more and more watered-down, boring, and irrelevant, leading to more lineup changes and a general lack of interest from many metal fans. After releasing a tantalizing glimpse of their former glory and attitude in \\"The System Has Failed\\", Megadeth has come back full-bore, with both guns blazing and chops and attitude to spare after a very successful touring stint on Gigantour and the release of one of the best metal albums of the 21st century.<br /><br />\\"United Abominations\\" is at times heavier than anything Megadeth has attempted in over fifteen years, more complex than anything they have done since \\"Rust In Peace\\", and more interesting and exhilarating than almost any other metal album so far this year. Chock full of Dave Mustaine's patented furious, convoluted riffing and vitriolic, political paranoia and militaristic themes, this is the most Megadeth Megadeth has been for a very, very long time. The first studio album to feature Glen Drover in the second guitar slot (a daunting proposition for any guitarist-Megadeth has burned through many a talented player in their day), he proves himself up to the challenge, and the album is laced with some amazing, over-the-top shred soloing and trade-off guitar \\"duelling\\" between the two guitarists. The solos are even credited, \\"80s-style, in the CD liner between the lyrics. Yes! A couple of caveats- the ridiculous quasi-political ranting is almost cartoonish at times, and I find it surprising that people actually take it seriously....the whole \\"Jack Bauer\\" 24 diatribe is just idiotic and corny. Of course, if you want serious, thoughtful and challenging political debate that makes you think, listen to Pain Of Salvation. Also, hearing Mustaine sing in French is just as annoying this time around as it was last time. That having been said, this is one of the best metal albums of the year in a year of great metal releases, and the best Megadeth album in over a decade.ics. Yes!

0887307280|5.0|This is a beautifully written book, and the tape narrated by the author is even better.  I recommend it for all entrepreneurs and budding entrepreneurs.  Basically, it provides sound advice both from a strategic level as well as a tactical level for making your business run like a well-oiled machine.  For those entrepreneurs who are overwhelmed, stressed, or overloaded, this book will change your life and the way you think about and approach your business.  It provides a great foundation for starting a business, especially if your ultimate aim is to sell it one day in the future.  In fact, for anybody who dreams of creating a business for the sole purpose of selling it to Google for $1.6B (a la You Tube), then this is a MUST READ.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This is the definitive Pearl Harbor movie. It often is unfairly compared  to 2001's \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" but in truth the two are almost in separate genres. Unlike the latter movie, which was basically \\"Titanic\\" with the Japanese attack thrown in the middle, this one was very thoroughly researched and carefully written to be as true to history as possible. It is probably as accurate as a film about the Pearl Harbor attack and the events leading up to it will ever be. However, the people who will truly enjoy this film are not the Sunday matinee crowd, but rather history enthusiasts, war movie buffs, and those who are eager to learn about the attack and don't mind sitting through a rather long movie that's not particularly exciting (unless you're enthralled by diplomats talking and admirals planning) except during its final minutes.  <br /> <br />Approaching its 40th anniversary, this movie is from another era; it was made at a time when good performances, historical accuracy, and attention to detail were more important than fast pacing, superstar cast members, and spectacular effects (though the effects in this film were top-notch for the time, and still hold up). There are no big-name actors in it, even at the time it was made. There are no soap-opera love triangles, pointless action sequences, or unnecessary dramatic moments. There's no filler, here, folks. Tora! Tora! Tora! moves along at a deliberate--though not slow--pace, and each aspect of the history leading up to the attack is covered such that a viewer who is paying attention should have no trouble knowing what is going on and who the key players are. The caveat is that, unless you are familiar with the related history, you HAVE to pay attention, or you will miss important plot points.  <br /> <br />Those who have an interest in war history, especially WWII history, should thoroughly enjoy it; however, it provides no gimmicks to make it more accessible to those with a merely passing interest in the film's subject matter. This is no summer blockbuster popcorn flick. It's a serious look at the motives behind the attack, and a thoughtful analysis of what allowed the attack to succeed. If you want lots of big explosions and Hollywood drama, you might be better off sticking to the 2001 film. For history buffs, though, this is the only way to go.
1591840562|5.0|Guy Kawasaki is such a funny writer, he keeps me laughing and engaged throughout the entire book.  Kawasaki is extraordinarily smart, educated, and experienced.  He provides real advice that you can take to the bank.  It's a fantastic read for anybody wanting to start a business, regardless of whether you need funding or not.  He tells you everything you need to know to prepare your pitch to venture capitalists but also encourages you to boot strap the business if at all possible.  He lets you know that there are not only venture capitalists out there, but there are also vulture capitalists, so be smart with how you approach VCs.  This book is a keeper, or great gift to anybody you know who is thinking of starting something up.
051788710X|2.0|At first glance, Conscious Dreaming is an entertaining read. That's because Moss draws extensively on his background as a novelist and writer of persuasive non-fictional pieces for the political arena when he writes about dreams and spirituality. Read between the lines of repeatedly bombastic, ego-inflated, highly unbelievable and ultimately useless personal accounts, and you'll see there's less meat on the bones than it originally appeared. This writer doesn't want to inform the reader, but rather he wants to sell them something - a lot of somethings - none of them worth the while because they all say the same thing, over and over again (\\"Look at ME, buy MY books, come to MY workshops!!\\"). <br /> <br />The reason the author doesn't include much in the way of working instructions for the beginner is simple: money. That is, the author actively seeks to entice you, the reader, to pay for the privilege of watching him put on his spiel for hours on end while he sells you yet another book (or three, one of which he ostentatiously titles as a \\"Book of the Dead\\"), a pricey set of DVDs (which he always seems to have on hand at his workshops even though he claims not be \\"a traveling salesman\\"), an \\"audio training course\\", a drumming CD, and, of course, more workshops. Who would fill those workshop seats at $100-800 a head (the high end of the scale reflects the cost of his \\"Dream Teacher Training\\" installments, of which there are currently four) if he simply gave away information between the covers of a book? <br /> <br />In short, while this book may serve as an entertaining eye-opener and a gateway to deeper exploration for the complete novice, the person behind the work warrants the very scrutiny advised when it was said \\"whenever a person speaks of a matter, never forget to inquire who the speaker *really* is\\". To that I would add \\"never forget to evaluate what the speaker really wants from his audience\\".
B000OCXMAE|5.0|yes its very different from the previous albums, and at the first listen i was a little reluctant but a week later and a few more listens, i love it, i like this new style, its great that they didn't repeat themselves, its something new, and they still are one of my favorite bands and its a great record <br /> <br />My favorite songs <br /> <br />Bleed it out <br />What ive done <br />Shadow of the day <br />Leave it all the rest <br />In between <br /> <br />
B000H5V8DG|5.0|At first it was rough because disc 5 from season 1 was not playing, then you sent me another copy and it was missing disc 4 and 5. Then you sent me another one and it is playing fine and I love it.
1416524800|2.0|this is the worst dan brown book. i got about 3/4 of the way through the book and just lost interest. it finally came to the point where i just wanted to finish the book because i've read so much of it. the ending wasn't anything spectacular.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|So 2800 plus Amazon reviewers love the show, and the other 200 don't.To be honest, I liked the characters. I even liked the idea of the show, although the western-type society really makes no sense. But that wasn't my biggest problem with this show. I read all the 5-star reviews like you probably have and I thought \\"Wow, maybe I'm missing out on some good stuff.\\" So I bought it. I liked the action scene in the beginning of the first episode \\"Serenity\\" and the special effects were very much believable for a tv show. But then it got very slow after that. It took a while for me to get in to the characters and then I kinda got hooked. Captain Mal I think is hilarious at times. So is Jayne. The \\"Shepeard\\" is a dumb choice,and at times very cheesy. Kaylee is...Kaylee. The doctor is cool and his sister River is so weird...howbeit deadly.  <br />But my main problem with this show is the sexual nature. This show glorifies prostitution as pointed out in another review. In fact prostitution is legal. They call them \\"Companions.\\" Inara, another crew member is one of them. Since when is it OK to have a prostitute who sleeps around with people from all over the galaxy on different worlds (men and women) to also be a motherlike figure full of love and compassion, as if there is nothing wrong with the lifestyle. It's sick. I don't care how pretty she is I couldn't get over her role as a \\"Companion.\\" Couldn't Whedon come up with something more noble for her instead of making a \\"whore\\" into a role-model. Come on. Well I guess maybe he likes that, as well as others. The show is just too raunchy for me. I would definately advise parents not to let there kids watch this show. Don't get me wrong. I liked the characters and where the stories were headed. But I kept having to fast-forward through sexual romps, lesbian kisses, unnecessary suggestive scenes which really made the experience sour. I had no idea this much crudeness was in it. While some shows keep it to a very small level, thisshow dedicates a whole episode to it. I know that I'm in the minority for caring about these things (which is sad) but if you care, then don't pick this up. Otherwise you would probably love it like some other people. <br />I'm going to see the movie \\"Serenity\\" and hope none of this nonsense is in it.
B0002EXH40|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I think the songwriting is top-notch and the musicianship kills. I like the version of \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" on this CD better than the new version on \\"United Abominations\\". \\"Train of Consequences\\" and \\"Reckoning Day\\" are incredible.
B000O77SOK|4.0|I AM SO GLAD THAT THEY ARE RELEASING THIS SHOW... FINALLY!!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FOREVER TO SEE THIS OUT ON DVD.  I AM SO EXCITED!!
1400063515|5.0|Good job, great book.  The short chapters make for easy reading in a busy environment.
B00005JPKE|3.0|I don't know if it's because it was directed by an American, but I saw a grand total of about 5 Americans die in this move, and about 5000 Japanese die.<br /><br />The Japanese did not use their defensive advantage at all.  They gave it up time and time again.<br /><br />Their petty infighting, and willingness to kill themselves rather than THE ENEMY seems to have been their biggest reason for their defeat.<br /><br />The movie pissed me off the whole way through.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|I'd rather watch a Lifetime movie staring Tina Yothers. 2 hours that I'll never get back! Save yourself and watch something else.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this product because I was unable to catch the show when it aired.  The trailers I saw really intrigued me.  While watching the first episode through my PS3, 2 of my teenagers saw it and started watching it.  Every day they asked if we could watch another episode.  Anything that can keep my kids' interest off of the PS3 and the Xbox 360 has to be one heck of a good product.  Everyone should watch this series.

B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee's voice is just amazing. Enjoy every song no matter how oftern I hear them!
B000002GXJ|3.0|Many people have already commented on the improved sound quality of the remasters, the overdubs/post-production of the \\"live\\" work, and the, by cd standards, very short song selection (recall this was originally a double vinyl back in the day). Some of the live versions here are spectacular (e.g. this is my favorite version of the many Hotel California's available - check out the second guitar solo!).    WEA missed an opportunity with the re-release to do something special with this album, but maybe they can do it for an anniversary edition sometime soon. As many people know, the material from this album came from two tours. One in 1976 to support Hotel California with Randy Meisner still in the group, and the other to support The Long Run in 1980 with Timothy B. Schmidt. So they have the \\"source\\" tapes for additional songs from each tour.    What I wish for is the first disc to be comprised of 1976/77 tour setlist and the second disc to be a 1980 tour setlist. Since they no doubt played many songs on both tours, they could choose from the \\"definitive\\" versions of some of the hits, and then round out the rest of the discs with songs that were only played on one of the tours. That way we could get \\"Try and Love Again\\" and \\"Pretty Maids all in a Row\\" on the 1976/77 disc, and \\"King of Hollywood\\" and \\"Sad Cafe\\" on the second disc. I think Eagles fans would love to have something like this and it would be a mega-seller for the band/record company.
B000P2A256|5.0|Just a little over a month ago, I asked my sister what ever happened to Maroon 5... then I saw a commercial about their new album.  I didn't hear their single, \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" until the album release date... and that was the AOL Sessions version.  I have to give this group it's props... no matter what genre you want to classify this group as, I am SO loving their music.  I've always loved Adam's voice and I can tell that this group takes pride in the music that they put out... which to me, is the best music.  The Studio version of \\"Makes me Wonder\\" rocks!! I honestly cannot pick a favorite song from the album, but off the top, \\"Wake Up Call\\", \\"If I Never See your Face Again\\", \\"Nothing Last Forever\\", \\"Back at Your Door\\"...and the infectious, \\"Makes Me wonder\\"...  For me...I think the album was worth waiting for, it's one of the best albums of 2007, and I look forward to seeing them live.  Great Job guys!!
B00005JPD0|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and I wrote down the date that it would be coming out on DVD. The only other Denzel movie that I did that with was Inside Man. I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!! The concept was great and the final scene was just beautiful. Robin Thicke's wife, Paula Patton, wasn't bad either and thank God Val Kilmer wasn't playing a bad guy. It was good to see Erika Alexander and I've missed seeing her around on the regular. All in all I thought it was a damn good movie and that's just my opinion!
0744592704|5.0|We have been reading this book for about a year now. My now 2.5 year old boy-girl twins like it so much we read it once or twice a week at least. The illustrations are different from most books, it is definitely night in the story but not at all scary. The story is very smartly told. <br /> <br />In the story the owl mother leaves the nest and her three babies, Sarah, Percy, and Bill discover that she is gone. Sarah and Percy and discuss where she is and when she might be back while Bill laments that he misses his mommy. Each of the three babies has their own personality and spin on mommy's disapperance, which is one reason why I personally like the book. Also, they decide to stick together until she comes back, a good sibling lesson. <br /> <br />In the end, the mother owl does return. I found this a good book during the times when I had a lot of out of town travel, I could read it, along with \\"Llama Llama Red Pajama\\" before leaving and explain that I will be back. In fact, when the kids were sad I was gone, their grandmother would remind them I would come back just like the owl mother .

B000I0RNV6|1.0|In searching for this title, almost all of them were sub-titled in English.  I selected, purchased, only to find out that is was all in Italian.  So, it's basically useless for me.  Ended up renting it from a video store.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I absolutely loved Funeral, the Arcade Fire's first album, and was anxious to hear what new creative genius would flow forth from Neon Bible. On first listen, only \\"No Cars Go\\" really caught my attention; I felt the album was disappointing and not as memorable as Funeral. However, I've had the experience where multiple listens reveal an album to be one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Neon Bible should not be heard in pieces. All of the tracks work together to create what I would call a rock masterpiece. The introduction of organ into their music at first annoyed my unaccustomed ears, but now the organ is the powerful soul of \\"My Body is a Cage.\\" Neon Bible tells a distinctly different story than Funeral, and the lyrics here, once they get into your system, flow through your veins. The simple but haunting tune of \\"Neon Bible\\" floats through your mind all the time; the unique sound of the ocean through instrumental rock in \\"Ocean of Noise\\" is unparalleled. <br /> <br />\\"Now who of you among us/ still believe in choice?/ Not I\\" <br /> <br />And, of course, \\"No Cars Go\\" is worth the whole price of the album. This song will have you jumping and rocking out to the fast guitars and then whispering to the soft decrescendos. <br /> <br />If you like experimental music, music that builds up and carries you along in its emotion, creative if ingenious composition and varied instruments-- if you're looking for more than your average \\"indie band\\"-- look to the Arcade Fire. Fans of Radiohead [think Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief], Bloc Party, Blonde Redhead, The Cure, and people who are willing to have their musical tastes stretched a bit will madly love this album. <br /> <br />Note: once you have this music flowing through your system, go see the Arcade Fire live! Neon Bible will be your favorite concert of the entire year.
0765342294|5.0|Thought it would be too childish a read, but too many people has suggested it.  I was surprised and found the story a delightful, quick read.
0316168815|5.0|It's not very often that a novel gets 5 stars from me; if it were entirely possible, I'd give it more.<br /><br />This story of a girl who has one of the most atrocious acts of violence done to her, followed by her murder and just-a-breath-away existence between her personal heaven and Earth makes for an unconvential yet beautiful story.<br /><br />Susie Salmon, the girl in question, can only watch as the lives of those she knew on Earth go on, fall apart, and work around her. She narrates these events with a clean, mature voice that stands out on every page. While some people might consider her narrative to be too \\"adult\\" as opposed to a teenager's stance, her voice is what makes the story. She has a grip on her surroundings and manages not to lose control of her emotions when it comes to her murderer, her parents, her brother, and especially her sister Lindsay.<br /><br />The most breathtaking scene comes when she manages to come back to Earth for a few brief hours to be with the boy--now a man-- she loves, and this is where we are allowed a look into Susie's desire to have back what was taken from her. If this isn't top notch writing, I don't know what is.<br /><br />In other hands, this novel would have been flowery and filled with purple prose, but Alice Sebold manages to take a steady hand with her words and language to create a story that echoes in one's mind for a long time. This is definitely on my Top 5 list, and will stay there no matter what. Long live \\"The Lovely Bones\\"!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I can't begin to say enough about how absolutely AMAZING this series is. I'm sure anyone who has seen it would agree. It has totally changed my life in how I view God's great creation, and can't understand why anyone would want to harm it in any way.   I LOVE LOVE LOVE this series.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|It is quite possible that wilco has never written a better song than \\"Impossible Germany.\\"  It is an epic that moves with grace with it's blazing guitars and gentle riffs.  It is simple, yet complex.  It's actually the type of song that rarely comes along.  I applaud Wilco and their creative force which drives this song.  Nels Cline's guitar is a welcome added dimension to the album.  It's one of the things I like about it best.  It's just pretty.  It gives me goosebumps, really.  He plays with such space that it could only be compared to improvisational jazz musicians like Miles Davis or Coltrane.   <br /> <br />The other reviews say that the album's best songs are the first and last three songs contained within it.  But don't be fooled, the songs in the middle are remarkable as well.  \\"Side With The Seeds\\" finds Wilco blazing with scorching wings through this instant classic.  Sure to be a great one to see live, no doubt. Do not be fooled by the reviews that call this album \\"afraid to be loud\\" or \\"alarmingly soft and weak.\\"  There are moments of sheer power on this album.  Sure enough to please any rock fan. <br /> \\"Shake it off\\", \\"Hate it here\\" and \\"leave me like you found me\\" are good too.   <br /> <br />While some songs may be better than others, there isn't one bad song on the record.  That is more than you can say for most bands today who fill most of their albums with filler.  This album finds Wilco as a band that will not be contained within one dimension, within one particular sound, and to that I say cheers!

B000KC8O3S|4.0|If you're a fan of the incredible music from the New Doctor Who, you'll thoroughly enjoy this CD.  Just one word of caution: if you're buying because you're a fan of \\"Song for Ten\\" (the song from the end of \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" where the new doctor picks out his wardrobe), be advised: the CD version is NOT the episode version.  Even though it did not evoke the same feeling as the original song from the episode, it's still worth picking up... there are some lyrics that didn't make it into the episode that foreshadow events that happen later in Series 2 that fans of the show will find very interesting.

1594489505|3.0|I was extremely impressed with The Kite Runner and would rate it five stars, and so I eagerly anticipated \\"Splendid Suns.\\"  While I believe this is a much better book than other \\"book club selections\\" (Life of Pi and The Secret Life of Bees come to mind), it was not as strong as Hosseini's first novel.  The power of Kite Runner comes from the honest portrayal of Amir's complex relationship with Hassan.  A relationship based on friendship yet marked by moments of cruelty.  Amir was flawed due to his own selfishness, and that's a theme to which Western readers can relate.    The characters of \\"Splendid Suns\\" are more one-dimensional.  Their \\"flaw\\" comes from the simple fact that they are women in a patriarchal society.  For Mariam, there is the added \\"flaw\\" of being born into a dirt-poor existence (the product of a scandalous affair).  Western readers can certainly sympathize with the characters' dismal state, but it's hard to empathize with them.  The reader surveys the horrific scenes with no real emotional connection.  On Maslow's hierarchy of needs, perhaps they were too busy subsisting to have the kind of bourgeois problems to which middleclass Westerners can relate.    Readers of the Kite Runner tend to believe it is autobiographical.  While Hosseini denies this, he had to expose his own vunerabilities to give us the power of that novel.  The sincere portrayal of Amir as an imperfect person who ultimately seeks redemption is literature in the highest form and will no doubt rank among the modern classics. If you haven't read Kite Runner yet, I highly recommend reading it first.  Don't let your opinion of \\"Splendid Suns\\" keep you from experiencing Hosseini's excellent first novel.
B00005JPAO|5.0|<br />  <br />Interesting movie - it tells the story of which no one could possibly know was happening to the Royal Family directly after Princess Diana's death.  The British invented the tabloid press they say - and the death of Diana was certainly no exception.    <br /> <br />Helen Mirren is great as the Queen herself.  Because the movie looks at the inside family drama, you see the Queen as a real person; sadness, irritations, quiet, and occasionally cracking a joke (very occasionally!).  <br /> <br />Very informative too about the relationship with the Prime Minister Tony Blair. I liked seeing how their different perspectives on the media came together and shaped each of them in a new way. <br />
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This series deserves to be packaged and sold the way Amazon.com has done..with class and dignity.  The series itself is thought provoking, suspenseful, and always full of twists and turns.  The glamour of the Amercian presidency continues to entertain, and WEST WING has done it with, style, and with intelligence.  Thank you for the complete set with the added extras in this package.  A Collector's item indeed!
B000P2A256|4.0|Maroon 5 was not a favorite band of mine ever. I did like a few songs by them in the past, but nothing that made me really fall for them. Yet here they are, back, with an exciting and energetic new album that really took me for surprise.     Now I will admit this isn't the most in- depth album ever of course and it is definitely radio friendly, but it is also indeed a solid, mature album with addictive hooks that will stick in your head all day. I myself have been listening to this album nonstop since the day I got it. I especially love the tracks If I Never See Your Face Again, Goodnight, Goodnight, Not Falling Apart, Back at Your Door, Nothing Lasts Forever and Won't Go Home Without You.     What can I say Maroon 5 really picked me up to be a part of their crowd, and has picked up many other new fans as well. Some older fans are lukewarm about it- but I feel they're really going to enjoy great success with this album. I highly recommend this stunning sophmore album.    4.5/5
B000NA1OXY|1.0|After the rather well- done album Under my Skin, I was hoping what I would continue to hear a more older and experienced Avril. Then I heard the terribly immature and overall lame single Girlfriend and just could not believe it. Where did her mind go- back to high school? I expect every artist to mature as time goes on and yet it seems although she goes on and on about how she has 'grown up' this album makes her sounds like she is 16; it's like she has seriously taken a step back age- wise.  <br /> <br />What is there to really say about it? It is nothing but a loud mess of an album with really lousy or just cliche kind of lyrics you expect on a debut album possibly but not on the third damn album. The only thing this album proves is that Avril refuses to grow up. I can't find one real good song on here I can actually listen to all the way through without cringing or getting so annoyed with.  <br /> <br />Avril will probably pick up plenty more young teens sure with this album since it does appeal to that age group- and her old fans nonetheless will buy it due to years of love for her past, and much better, albums- so this album will bring success for her sure. But the older fans who listen to the album, and actually claim that this one surpasses the first two albums, I'm sure will be in the minority. Some like I even will find it complete trash, wondering what the hell happened to Avril's direction between this album and Under My Skin, an album that showed some promise of further growth. <br /> <br />I am very disappointed overall the way Avril went with her music and I just hate this album. I am just so glad I decided to borrow this album from a friend before even considering buying it.  <br /> <br />1/5
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I think this movie is daring as to what they show but true to what happens in life. No boundaries are in this movie just like there are none in real life.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|You have an HDTV. You have a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. You owe it to humankind to own Planet Earth. Like pretty pictures? Like pristine sound? Into David Attenborough? Stop reading and start buying. Well, do it!
1582701709|3.0|I received the unabridged CD as a gift.  The opening music/sounds made me roll my eyes and think \\"what the.....\\" I kept listening out of respect to the friend who bought this for me.....did what I could to keep an open mind...although the \\"genie\\" and \\"universe\\" references made that a difficult task.  They kept using various synonyms for God to relate to as many people as possible, but the \\"genie\\" thing was a bit much. <br /> <br />Basically there are 4 cds telling you the same things over and over - think possitive....about life, yourself, things around you. \\"Do unto Others as you would have them do unto you\\", \\"Love your neighbor as you love yourself\\", \\"What goes around comes around\\" \\"Karma\\" (or \\"Instant Karma\\")  No matter how you look at it - from what ever religious belief or non-belief - it is all about being thankful/grateful for what you have and thinking possitive.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|WOW, This concert beats the others.(And I loved the others!!) The sound, the lighting, the energy of the music and the musicians. You can truly see how these musicians enjoy what they do.
B00005221M|5.0|I never tire of watching this spectacular movie and enjoyed seeing the expanded version. I was surprised at how well I know the movie and was aware of all the changes. <br /> <br />Thank you for the visual beauty, haunting music and passionate story.
0767803434|4.0|There are some unrealistic elements to this movie, but only when you stop and think about it.  It's an action movie and there will always be some stretches of reality.  Harrison Ford delivers as does his supporting cast.  It will pull you into the story without any real trouble, you will find yourself routing for the President and telling the evil guys \\"take that\\".  In the end, you will feel good about it and you may even be inspired by it.  Enjoy!
0316018953|5.0|Michael Connelly is my favorite author.  I always wait with great anticipation for his next book, particularly if Harry Bosch is the main protagonist. <br /> <br />This Bosch novel was very entertaining and well-written, but way too short.  The characters were not developed as in previous novels.  I certainly hope there are more Bosch offerings and that are full-length novels.
B000NDIAWY|3.0|From the moment I heard Brandi's newest single the Story I was very excited to get this album, just as I did when I fell in love with Follow on the radio and snatched up her debut.  <br /> <br />But as I have listened to the Story repeatedly I have to say compared to her debut it just lacks the strength the debut had. The beginning of the album is rather good with the Story and My Song really making it an exciting and beautiful start, but in the middle it really does start to drag with some not so impressive songs. Songs like Josephine and Losing Heart I almost always skip especially. Others such as Wasted and Shadow on the Wall I only listen to occassionaly and not with much interest. The ending of the album finishes up nice enough with Again Today but still overall leaves me feeling just so- so about the entire album. <br /> <br />Her debut was amazing- each track left me wanting more. This album...not so much. Matter of fact I can put this album down for days and not have any desire to pick it back up for another play. It's just not that memorable or exciting of an album. For the most part it has pleasant but boring songs that are just sung very well. I love Brandi's voice and overall style but I cannot say this album meets up to her debut at all. It is unfortunately what I am going to call a sophmore slump, and I'm disappointed that it is.  <br /> <br />So although I am still a fan of Brandi's, and do enjoy listening to a few of the songs on the Story like Turpentine and My Song, her first album still is made of her best work in my opinion. I hope I do enjoy her later works much more.  <br /> <br />3/5
0694003611|5.0|My two year old son Ethan was afraid of the moon so a coworker told me to buy this book to show him not to be scared of it and now instead of being scared of the moon he says \\"Hi\\" to the moon, so my family and i love this book and we read it every night to him before bed.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Everyone has raved about the high quality and production values of this set, so I'll try to adhere to more personal elements in my review. <br /> <br />Watching this in high definition recreated the feelings of awe I remembered when I first saw a high-def program in a store display many years ago.  The crisp details and sounds are riveting, and playback was flawless on our Xbox HD-DVD player.  In my opinion this is the best program available to showcase a high-def home theater system, based not just on my own responses but those of our family and friends who don't have HD at home and have watched this with us.   <br /> <br />Not only is is a stunning technological achievment, but it is also an achievment in the art of documentary film making.  The cinematography is exquisite, the compositions and editing are breathtaking, and the science is fascinating.  As a fan of nature documentaries, I can't recall any series in the last decade that so frequently left me saying, \\"I have never seen anything like that before\\" or \\"I didn't know an animal like that existed.\\"  We enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's narration in the version aired in the US, but there is no comparison to Sir Attenborough. <br /> <br />Though this set would be a value even at the retail price, once you factor in Amazon's pricing, it's almost a must-have for HD-DVD owners.  This HD-DVD set is easily our most favorite media purchase of the HD era.
B00002ND77|5.0|It's really an amazing film in which Mr. Freeman does an magnific interpretation. It hit you in your stomach the way it present the black people in the american society and really think.
0743496728|5.0|In reading this book, I had to remind myself that it was fiction. I recently read \\"The Glass Castle\\" by Jeanette Walls and had trouble believing it, and it was a memoir. As a book of fiction, Nineteen Minutes seems all too real.  <br /> <br />This is my first novel by Jodi Picoult and will not be my last. She looks at a horrific school shooting from the points of view of many different characters. We see it from the point of view of the shooter, the first detective on the scene, a high school student, her mother who is a judge, the parents of the shooter, among others. This book had me thinking long after I had finished. I found myself feeling things that you \\"shouldn't\\" feel. I felt sympathy for the shooter, and yet we know in our logical minds that nothing justifies shooting children. I also caught myself when reading about the bullying thinking they deserved what they got. But no, that can't be right because no one deserves to be slaughtered by a school shooter.  <br /> <br />It is a thought provoking book and proves that there are no simple answers. It gives valuable insight into the everyday world of school children and the difficult choices they make simply to fit in. Maybe this book should be required reading for all students, as well as their parents.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I may not be as eloquent as other reviewers but I can tell you that for me this is one of the absolute best shows on television I have ever seen... <br /> <br />The story is based around two brothers and their quest to uncover and destroy evil entities and ultimately find and destroy a demon that killed their mother. There is alot mystery around why the demon did in fact kill their mother and as the story progresses various clues appear in their adventures which expose a greater plot. The dialogue and acting is superb. The stories themselves are for the most part interesting and full of intriguing plot twists which really make you think. In addition, having the muscle car (67 Chevy Impala) and the classic rock clips are just icing on the cake and fit in with the storyline and its characters perfectly. The show isn't as cotton candy as other shows in its genre and there are definitely darker overtones in the show compared to others. This is one of the many factors that gives the show its charm and make it so enveloping. <br /> <br />I can't imagine anyone watching this show and not getting hooked. Do yourself a HUGE favor and give this show a look. You won't be dissapointed.
B000O75F7C|3.0|First off PT has been tied for my fav band since they released Stupid Dream...that being said wth this cd is like 45 mins!  45 mins hmmm there's half a cd missing here!  I feel ripped off to start then the music...<br /><br />Well I like most of what's on here though strangely I don't really care for the 2 mellow songs in Sentimental and My Ashes even though I usually dig their slower stuff, Sleep Together doesn't do much for me either and feels out of place.<br /><br />Anesthetize title track and especially Way Out of Here are awesome though which makes this cd feel more like an EP with IMO about 30 mins of good music (10 of which is questionable even because I think 10 mins of Anesthetize could be cut out and be better off for it).<br /><br />The lyrics are recycled throughout the cd in different songs and there are so many forgetable parts which give the cd a sort of droning sound or feel.  Also if you listen closely they completely lifted the guitar section from In Absentia's Trains and put it in Way Out Of Here (I think that's the right track).  ;) Nice, less new stuff.  PT is suffering from SW having 2+ bands draining his creative juices...<br /><br />Meh...the cd is o.k. nothing amazing really, which is very un-PTlike, their worst release in...well I'm not even sure how long maybe since Voyage 34...a VERY LONG TIME anyways :(
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I am admittedly not a James Bond fan. I have seen a few - not many - of the movies in this highly celebrated series and I have been relatively entertained. I think the more recent installments have been a little too much for me. I feel like James Bond is a role that needs to be overacted and cheesy, and I don't like it. With Casino Royale I was faced with an unpolished James Bond who still has an unabashed cockiness that gets him into trouble more often than it gets him out of it. That was the piece missing from the other James Bond movies. I really liked Casino Royale. <br /> <br />I thought Daniel Craig did a fantastic job as James Bond, especially in the face of so much skepticism from the die-hard fanbase. He fit the mold of the unrefined hot shot very well. He was reckless and broke the rules. Maybe an imperfect James Bond is actually a more perfect James Bond. Think about it.  <br /> <br />The chase scene in Casino Royale can certainly rival that of most, if not all, other movies. At the beginning of the movie Bond must chase a man, but it is on foot rather than in cars. The pace of the chase coupled with the stunt work done for the scene were great.  <br /> <br />If you're a James Bond fan, I will assume you've already seen it. If you're not, like me, I think there is still plenty here if you like action/spy flicks.  <br />
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This is a great collection of songs by The Boss for those who haven't bought Springsteen CDs/records before.  I bought it for my 11-year old son who is getting interested in rock music.  Maybe this collection missed a hidden diamond along the way, but overall all the great Springsteen songs going back to the 70's are included.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Watching Planet Earth on a full 1080p setup is a wonderful thing.  This transfer may not be reference quality, and some camera shots are better than others, but the footage is incredible and still generally of very high quality.  I personally enjoyed the narration of David Attenborough over Sigorney Weaver, so keep in mind the difference if you purchase the set and you previously watched it via a US broadcast.
B0000009NI|5.0|While some might say that this album is not a classic or timeless, I couldn't disagree more...  at 52, whenever I pop this CD in, it takes me right back to my concert-going days of youth...  wearing glitter and sequins and watching Bowie at his best! While my days of glitter (and sequins to some extent) are over, my enjoyment of this album NEVER ends! <br />I still FREAK-OUT to a Moon Age Daydream and Suffragette City still makes me yell... \\"Wham, Bam, Thank You M'aam!\\"  I still consider this album Bowie's best overall from the first track to the last.
0307275639|5.0|A delightful, profound, pleasantly sad and yet inspiring book. In my similar review for the dvd I would say If you have lost someone close, find words and aphorisms magical, maybe need direction, want a new perspective about what life is about, in finding hope from a terminal situation or just wanting to feel that humanity can be special, then spare the couple of hours for this film.
032147404X|4.0|excellent and well presented information. nice writing style,punctuated with humor. interesting and keeps your attention.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins presents a stunningly written piece of work in The God Delusion.  Not only are his arguments crystal clear and perfectly cohesive, they are effective and convincing.  It is very interesting to get a scientist's critique on an habitually philosophical question.  While his arguments may not ring with academic philosophy, they certainly point out many of the flaws with it as science sees it.  At the end of the day, the average person lives in the reality of this world and thus is less affected by philosophical blathering and more with the arguments that Dawkins makes.    I absolutely love the way that Dawkins takes apart the differences between science and religion.  That science is an empirical art which looks to elucidate the unknown as opposed to religion which \\"worships the gaps\\" is, I would say, one of his most important points if we are trying to look at the history of science.  This interplay between sicence and religion is one of the most important conflicts of our day - starting with Galileo (who was just pardoned in the last 20 years) to the Scopes Trial to our present Kansas School Board v. Irrefutable Evidence.    Where we draw the line for the territory of science and the territory of religion is a very mercurial distinction.  Dawkins makes the interesting argument that if we use empirical thinking in all aspect of our life, we will realize that religion is completely irrational.  It is time that we finally had a brilliant argument free of ad hominem attacks and name-calling; Dawkins does a wonderful job.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|Great music, great dancing, great atmosphere, great romance, and enough schmaltz to make this a wonderful DVD to own (even if you have forgotten about the charm of the Catskills)>
0618551050|5.0|It's been more than 40 years since I sat in a physics classroom. My impression of physicists was that they were totally confused and hyperactive, so I opted for the math major. The mathematicians didn't know what they were doing either, but they did not let it bother them. (For more on this see \\"Constructive Analysis\\" by Bishop & Bridges.) I preferred a more laid back, friendly environment. Anyway, the motto of science now seems to be, \\"If you know what you are doing, it's not research.\\"  <br />  <br />In the 1960s and 70s I encountered nonlinear resonance in celestial mechanics.  It stabilized the dynamics, in some cases at least, but destroyed the perturbation theories that had served so well for centuries. Numerical integration triumphed, except, of course, in France. The problem was a race between decreasing numerators and decreasing denominators (\\"small divisors\\"). So it is difficult to see how such ad hoc mathematics can ever prove anything about string theory or anything else. Incidentally, Jurgen Moser claimed to have proven that the perturbation theories of classical celestial mechanics did converge, but even if this is true, it is not relevant to anything. This is one of the few places where Smolin provides a little mathematical detail and it is rather amusing. But then physicists do something called \\"renormalization,\\" which means, I think, they discard all the terms with singularities (or infinities, as Smolin calls them).  <br />  <br />My thought many decades ago was that the cause of quantum behavior must be nonlinear resonance. And if the physicists didn't know that, they soon would.  But it seems physicists read only cosmology, not celestial mechanics. However, check out Prof. Snoke's essay:   <br />[...]  <br />  <br />The process Smolin describes is really a blind search in a multidimensional space with a weird topology. The only people who would do such a thing must be both brilliant and stupid at the same time. There are a lot of people with highIQs who are otherwise dysfunctional. This seems to describe those willing to pursue a career in academic physics, where the rewards are modest and the political bickering is petty and intense. Smolin calls this \\"sociology\\" and it incudes the whole craft of \\"grantsmanship,\\" as well as what he describes. A good source on this is the science journalist Daniel Greenberg (\\"Science. Money, and Politics\\").  <br />  <br />What can I say?  Thanks, Prof. Smolin for reintroducing me to the arcane, esoteric, confusing, and amusing world of theoretical physics. I think it will make a much better retirement hobby that doing crossword puzzles. My next read will not be the Woit book (\\"Not Even Wrong...\\"), but Carver Mead's \\"Collective Electrodynamics,\\" the primary reference in Snoke's essay. He clains that the whole of physics since 1930 has been a vast wasteland, but he has tried to take the first steps to redeam this once productive but ever confusing discpline. Let's cheer him on and also wish Smolin the greatest success. My suggestions: if you can do it with ODEs, look at Picard-Chebyshev. If you need PDEs, try kindred approaches using orthogonal polynomials instead of finite elements. After all, this may not be the \\"best\\" of all possible universes, but it likely is the most dynamically stable.  All the rest have disappeared.   <br />
B000HIVOI2|3.0|First, let me start by saying that I love this movie. Perhaps because I traveled to Egypt when I was 16 and I saw the glory of the giant pyramids in person (just don't tell an Egyptian that it was the aliens who built their pyramids and not their ancestors, he or she will be mad at you forever!).<br />I also love Sci-Fi flicks, and this movie has a great story. if you haven't seen it and you like Sci-Fi movies, even adventure movies with Kurt Russell, you'll love this one.<br /><br />Now about the Blu-ray DVD:<br /><br />Let me say that I have been a happy HD DVD owner for almost a year now, but seeing some the movies that I love in Blu-ray only, made me decide to get a Blu-ray player.<br /><br />Video: The picture quality of this Blu-ray disc shows excellent CLARITY and BRIGHTNESS and BETTER COLORS that were not on the standard DVD. It seems that the brightness level was boosted, but also at the cost of some graininess and video noise.<br /><br />The Picture looks almost perfect in the bright sunny desert scenes, but with very visible grains indoors.<br />Overall, comparing this version to the dark (less grainy SD DVD) is like the difference between Day and Night!<br />Also, This BD has a cool disc menu with ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic that turn into English letter.<br /><br />There was a problem with the subtitled translation of the Alien language or ancient Egyptian (I'm not sure if this language was actually made up in Hollywood like the \\"KLINGON\\" language in the Star Trek Movies). The problem is, the translation should show up in English whenever that language is spoken, but it doesn't!!!!!! One helpful reviewer on this page suggested going to the main menu and selecting English subs, and it works!, but you end up with subtitles throughout the whole movie. This release might have been rushed to the market (like many Blu-ray releases of 2006 in order to compete with the other HD format). How long do we \\"Stargate\\" fan have to wait again before we get a release with a good picture quality (hopefully grain free and no subtitle problem)????<br /><br />Audio: very good<br /><br />Conclusion: I can say that this is the best version of this movie available to date! but it has its problems. If you can't wait and you don't mind turning on the subtitles during the whole movie, it's a great release under $20.d no subtitle problem)????    Audio: very good    Conclusion: I can say that this is the best version of this movie available to date! but it has its problems. If you can't wait and you don't mind turning on the subtitles during the whole movie, it's a great release under $20.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|The cast their usual excellent, action scenes thrilling.  But, a couple of questions (I'm told Steven Speilberg and George Lucas pay each other \\"one point,\\"  one percent of each film, to look over each other's shoulder and ask questions).  First, though I don't follow the series in magazines, I'm told Jean regenerates.  Why didn't she this time?  And with Rogue taking the cure, why couldn't Jean?  After all, Rogue returned to the fold to be welcomed when she'd taken the treatment. <br /> <br />On the \\"making of\\" sections of the DVD's almost every cast-member spoke of the series touching their own chord of feelings of lonliness, apartness.  This surely does, to be ostracized by the \\"different\\" ones bacause one is no longer different! <br /> <br />Fortunately the manager of the theatre spoke to the crowd to tell us to wait through the credits for something important.  Bless his heart!
B000024D4R|5.0|I first got \\"Animals\\" way back in 1996. Being a major Floyd fan, I instantly fell in love with the exquisite lyrics and fantastic music. Eleven years later, being a bit older and a lot wiser, I see \\"Animals\\" as a piece of social commentary which is still relevant to this day.  <br /> <br />I see the \\"Dogs\\" as the jackbooted \\"Waffen-SS-like\\" thugs that most soldiers and police officers have become in this day of encroaching tyranny. Have you noticed how increasingly militarized LEOs (law enforcement officers) have become? Have you noticed how thuggish the United States military has acted under not only the command of George W. Bush, but even under Bill Clinton? <br /> <br />I see the \\"Pigs\\" as the ones in power, the ones who ultimately call the shots in the world. I see the first group of pigs as the big central bankers (Rockefellers, Rothschilds, etc.) and corporate bigwigs (Ted Turner, Michael Eisner, etc.) who control the power through their fortunes in corporate neo-fascist fashion. I see the second group of pigs as the puppet politicians who are put in the government to give everybody the false assumption that they have a choice when it comes to elections (Republican and Democrat are basically one and the same). Finally, I see the third group of pigs as pro-censorship people such as Mary Whitehouse, Jack Thompson, Brent Bozell, and to some extent social commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage who have frequently called for the American government to impose virtually total tyranny. <br /> <br />I see the sheep as the willfully ignorant \\"be a follower, not a leader\\" masses that most everybody has become thanks to them being dumbed down by mainstream media, propaganda masquerading as news, and even violent entertainment. Have you noticed how people care more about \\"American Idol\\" than they do about their freedoms? Have you noticed how people care more about Britney Spears not wearing underwear than encroaching tyranny? Ultimately, the end of the song sees the sheeple being pushed too far, so they rebel against the dogs, but little do the sheeple know that the dogs are seen by the pigs as \\"expdendable\\" because the pigs are the ones who hold the power. In the end, the pigs remain in power, and soon they will have more jackbooted enforcers to enslave the sheep once again. <br /> <br />The issues that Waters covered in the album's original 1977 release still hold true 30 years later. \\"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\\"
B00004D3C1|5.0|Straight up rock and roll.  Not too soft, not too metal, but just enough crunch and plenty of good ole-fashioned stoner-rock straight ahead riffs.  Creativity, style, attitude, these guys have it all.  I count at least 5 EXCELLENT songs on this one CD.  I mean TOTALLY EXCELLENT.  Another 5 very good songs.  I mean, come on, what more can you ask for on one CD?  This might be their best CD, or close to \\"In Search Of\\", \\"Action is Go\\", but ahead of \\"California Crossing\\".  Plus check out the extra folders on the CD (use your PC), there's extra songs and 2 movies on it too.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|When I sat down to watch this movie, I wasn't expecting much.  Reviews from this movie release turned me off from seeing it even though I enjoyed the first two installments.  To my surprise, this was actually a very good movie...as far as superheroes go.  Sure, I was stunned by Professor X's and Cyclops early departure, especially since it comes at the hands Gray/Phoenix.  I was surprise that Wolverwine doesn't exhibit any guilt.  If he hadn't set Phoenix loose in the first place, none of this would have happened.  Berry's Storm as usual was boring, Rogue, I always thought was a boring mutant.  Honestly, I thought the boy was going to be the answer to curing Phoenix, since no one's powers work around him, but it doesn't seem that answer occured to anyone.  So we bring Gray back just to kill her again.  I love the explanation to how she returned: \\"I don't know\\".  Alrighty then.  Why not just have her say \\"because the screenwriters said so\\"?  Still, this was an entertaining installment BUT it definitely needs to end here.
B000O178BY|5.0|YEAR ZERO could very well be Trent Reznor's best album of all time, HOWEVER, Pretty Hate Machine, Downward Spiral, and The Fragile are too classic of albums to say Year Zero is better right now, BUT 10 years from now YEAR ZERO may end up being Reznor's best!! By the way i love 'With Teeth' i think its very different from any other Reznor album. Year Zero has so much depth and creativity, im so surprised how good it came out!! OUTSTANDING WORK TRENT!! can we expect another new album 2 years from now????
B000EGCITG|5.0|Don't be put off by the explicit rating, and don't buy it from Amazon despite the great price.  You owe it to yourself to go to the store and buy this album right now.  Pink finally deserves to be lauded as an artist.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I bought this watch from Amazon about two weeks ago and have never been more pleased with a product.  I have been asked about the watch everyday since I started wearing it.  I am in a professional where people REALLY care about watches (military pilots) and everyone around me has the Tag or Omega or the Breit., but all want to know more about my watch.  Very quick shipping, like 6 days or so by the time I ordered it to the time I had it on.  Has a nice heavy feel to it and looks GREAT!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Since I'd been waiting for their new album for long time I am so dissapointed in their new album. It was kinda interesting because they tried new style but that's not Linkin Park and that's not Linkin Park I love! I don't know what happened to them. It didn't feel like Linkin Park at all.
B00001ODGR|2.0|I had great hope for this DVD based on its description and the generally positive reviews.  But wow, what a disappointment due to the poor audio.  I could only make it through about 3 songs, then I just had to turn it off, the sound was bad, bad.  Unfortunate as the show itself looked promising, I just couldn't listen to it.  I tinkered a bit, double-checking my system, and trying all of the audio options on the DVD.  I found that the 5.1 mix and the stereo mix were nearly the same, as the 5.1 mix did not use the center channel at all, and barely used the surrounds & LFE.   Seriously, without looking to see which was playing, you wouldn't be able to tell the two apart.  Even worse though, is that the sound that did come out was poor.  As in tinny, compressed, lifeless.  I don't know if I've described it right, all I know is that I had to turn it off.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The BBC put a lot of time and money into making this documentary. It was a HUGE gamble, because documentaries, particularly of this nature, rarely sell well. Well, it paid off. <br /> <br />This is the documentary that has set the bar! It is named Planet Earth, no less! <br /> <br />If you have a HDTV set-up, you are really in for a treat with the Blu-Ray Edition Planet Earth. When I want to show off my nice 50\\" Plasma TV, I always insert one of these four DVDs! The picture is beautiful and crisp in either 720p or 1080i! (My plasma doesn't do 1080p, unfortunately, but there's not a significant difference.) Every single scene in on each disk could easily be used as a desktop wallpaper image! <br /> <br />There are 11 episodes over the four discs. My biggest complaint is the lack of extra content. Unfortunately, there is no extra content on the BD or HD-DVD editions! There is some really nice content on the regular edition, such as the nearly 3 hour complimentary feature Planet Earth: The Future. It angers me that they did not include this on the HD editions, because there is room... <br /> <br />My other complaint has to do with the narration. Don't get me wrong, David Attenborough does a wonderful job of narrating all 11 episodes. Mr.Attenborough was the narrator on the original release of the BBC Planet Earth. When the Discovery Channel picked the episodes up, they made the decision to re-narrate in an American voice, I assume, choosing Sigourney Weaver. Having watched some of the episodes on the Discovery Channel, I was familiar with the brilliantly smooth narration of Mrs.Weaver. It would have been nice if they had included the extra audio tracks to choose Sigourney, if you so desired. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, this is definitely worth the money. I have even bought two more sets for friends! This documentary is a wild, secretly educational ride - one that will make you more aware and protective of our beautiful planet. Pop a disc into your HD player, sit back, relax, and you will be in AWE!! <br /> <br />
B000P2A256|4.0|I was not the biggest fan of Maroon 5 when they released their debut. After borrowing it from my sister I realized this band is much more than what their radio play gives them credit for. Now here is their sophmore attempt. After hearing the single 'Makes Me Wonder' I was very eager to pick this CD up. I loved the catchyness of the single as well as Maroon 5 once again bringing the classic 1970's funk/disco/soul sound back. When I bought this album I really didn't find it as good as I thought. Listening to the first 5 or so tracks it came off as nothing really fresh, but rather just more of 'Songs About Jane'. Yet, I ended up listening to the album strait through and second time, then a third time and so on and so forth. This album really is something fresh. Songs like 'Kiwi, 'Not Falling Apart' and Back At Your Door' are just a few of the tracks that really stand out. There is for some reason a bit of elements from early 80's new wave, like Depeche Mode, or the Police. If you listen to the keyboards I think you may just hear the same. This new album is worth the chance it really does grow on you and I think it may just be better than Maroons debut and probably of the best albums to be released this year.

I've learned from this that ultimately, you have to expand on who you want to learn from if you desire to get to that next level.  You can always learn more from a different culture, family, value system, standard, and so on - just remember to maintain your course and never stop learning!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth, one of the forefathers of thrash metal has returned with yet another album that will toss Metallica further into the abyss of sell outs and has beens. 'United Abominations' is without a doubt one of the freshest compelations that Dave Mustane has released in a long while. Though the topics may be touchy especially with all the happenings in politics in the past seven years, this messege is brought to its listeners with a fantastic 'score'. Mustane really goes back to basics reminding the masses of what Metal always has been. With elements of classic thrash as well as epic and 1980s Brittish Steel. Also Megadeth has done alot of work to really bring out the best for Metal from a vocal standpoint. Dave Mustaine actually makes the best effort yet to sing along with special guests like Chritsine Scabbia from Lacuna Coil. This album is a very impressive piece and a must have in your metal collection.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The Shield and The Wire are my two favorite \\"cop\\" shows. They're really more than just cop shows though. If you take this entire series as a whole (5 seasons so far) it's like a snapshot of the world (specifically, America) we currently live in. Every human emotion I can think of gets screen time on The Shield. But this is by no means an emotional type \\"soap opera\\". It's as down and dirty as it gets and the characters are real. Every character in the show has problems, no matter what level of command they're at, or how tough (or weak) they are (or appear). That's probably the thing I like most about shows like The Shield and The Wire. The cops aren't 100% good, and the criminals aren't 100% bad (although, there's some bad mf's in here if you know what I mean). From an entertainment standpoint, these DVDs are as addictive as some of the drugs portrayed in it. I have a hard time not watching at least an entire disc every time I sit down to watch it. Owning TV shows like this is both a blessing and a curse because they definitely cut into potential sleep time (or whatever else you have going on).<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, these DVDs are impressive. As you may have noticed, there is quite a bit of grain and \\"noise\\" in the video quality. At first I was disappointed and thought it was poor recording quality but have since come to find out that it's because the show was filmed with 16mm film. I am no authority on TV cameras or film, but apparently the type of film directly affects how the final DVD presentation appears. I have also come to appreciate the look and think it adds to the overall raw nature of the show. If it were too polished looking, it would probably be a downside. The Shield is gritty and rough, just how it looks. The sound is standard Dolby 2.0 and sounds great. Nothing fancy, but it does the trick.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want well written drama with a good dose of action, comedy, and suspense...look no further than The Shield. As mentioned earlier, I also recommend The Wire, which is equally as good. These types of shows are more than just good TV, they're art. The same type of talent goes into writing, acting, and producing this as it does for you're favorite musician or painter to create a masterpiece.entioned earlier, I also recommend The Wire, which is equally as good.

B000F1IQN2|4.0|I was very curious to see this chapter of history. The story of the 11 Israeli athletes getting killed by Palestinian terrorists and the story that followed. I feel the actors chosen to play the characters couldn't have been better and the movie itself was incredible. However I feel the message that was sent to the movie going public was the incorrect one. (Caution: when I say incorrect I don't mean untrue)<br /><br />Right now we are living in a very controversial time where the situation in the Middle East is a very sensitive subject. I am one who wants to see peace, but with the violence escalating every day we are far from reaching that goal. What people need to understand is that only one side wants peace and unfortunately `Munich' did not elaborate on that enough. The Israeli task force is depicted to be just as uncaring as the Palestinian extremist groups in this movie. (Never do they show actual Palastinans that truly want peace).  In the beginning the message is to kill the plotters of the Munich murders and in the end the Israelis are leaving bodies uncovered in shame and the main character gives up his love for his homeland. The scene where Eric Bana's character sees himself fighting along side the terrorists is an absolute disgrace. The pieces of the movie that should have been elaborated more were the people they were killing. These were Palestinian officials high in power living far away from the Palestinian hostage camps in lavish mansions and accepting money from all different governments just to keep the violence going. Those are actual living breathing people in the P.L.O. that are still alive today.  The should have made it more clear that the mission was to kill the terrorists and not to hurt the innocent Palestinians like the women and children as well as Palestinian men that had nothing to do with assassinating Jewish people.<br /><br />Is this movie good...yes it is a brilliant film worthy of its credit. Will is be nominated for awards...absolutely. I don't think that Spielberg displayed anything untrue in this movie. He did however show more sympathy towards the wrong side. I believe his message was to say he wants peace and the only way to show that was that both sides shedding blood constantly would only make it worse and there never will be peace. I feel there is nothing wrong with showing there are two sides fighting and only one side wants peace. If the world can understand that there are certain people (not a nation) that don't then the true evils in this world will be wiped out and there finally will be peace..absolutely.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|Das Konzert \\"A New Journey\\" ist eine sehr gelungene Fortsetzung des ersten Konzert`s. Die Lieder sind alle klasse und passen perfekt zu Celtic Woman.    Die neue Stimme Hayley Westenra, die auch schon solo große Erfolge feiern konnte, passt hervorragend in das bisher bestehende Quintett. Jede einzelne Stimme ist für sich etwas ganz besonderes.     Bitte Celtic Woman, tourt doch einmal durch Deutschland
B000O178BY|5.0|Nine Inch Nails has always been known for being unique controversial and just plain bizzare. There is no artist out there at this time nor has there ever been that carries this kind of sound. Based on the late 70's-and early 80's New Wave sound and the early years of heavy metal and techno. Trent Reznor put all those sounds together to form what is now one of the biggest underground music movements to date, Industrial/metal you can dance to. Ever since 'Pretty Hate Machine' NIN as always been one of the most anticipated acts in music. This time around Reznor created another triumph with 'Year Zero' Being skeptical because it was the fasted release since Reznor's previous 'With Teeth' I was proven dead wrong. 'Year Zero' is everything NIN has been and more. Never a dull moment no songs to single out. All it is, is the music you always loved from this band. All hail Trent Reznor!
1582701709|3.0|I think the ideas in the book are good. The idea that if you visualise something that it will happen is very mundane. It's also very untrue.  <br /> <br />This book says, if you ask, it will be GIVEN to you by the \\"universe.\\" That is just completely not true. It does not empasize the fact that you must also act upon any idea that comes to you that could make your dreams come true. <br /> <br />If your dream is to become a millionaire, the idea in the book is that if you visualize yourself as a millionaire, it will eventually happen. What it doesn't address in enough detail is that as you visualize, your brain will attempt to come up with ideas that will help you become a millionaire. Unless you act upon those ideas, you will not become a millionaire. <br /> <br />The universe does not just GIVE you something with no effort other than \\"visualizing\\" something. This book appeals to those who are greedy or fat and want to be rich or thin. It kind of annoys me but other than that, the ideas there are good.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|That 5 stars I gave is for the music. It is great. However, the packaging is really poor. They just slip the discs in a cardboard case. This makes it very easy to scratch the disc. I had to put the discs in separate jewel cases. It's rediculous.
1904233023|5.0|The premise behind the story is very creative and unique. It was thought of before anyone else thought of it and and has been copied in the movies since its release, but nothing will compare to Card's brilliance. The author has quickly become my favorite author. He includes elements of science fiction, fantasy, ethical dilemmas, and the nature of men. Overall, this book is amazing.
B000O178BY|5.0|this is another great cd from nice inch nails. its so awsome. it has many great songs
B000NQR7NO|4.0|I'd actually give this record a 7-out-of-10, or a 3.5, but Amazon doesn't give me that choice (When I get around to reviewing \\"Whatever People Say...\\" I'll give it a four).  This album is more \\"dancey\\" relative to \\"Whatever People Say...,\\" which is more \\"punky,\\" though of course I wouldn't characterize either album as \\"dance\\" or \\"punk.\\"  I'll give the Arctic Monkeys credit for not simply repeating their first album's formula and I think this album shows more diversity.  So, in a way, I applaud the direction they've taken.  I just don't enjoy it as much, is all. <br /> <br />Also, I wouldn't characterize the first album as a \\"classic\\" at the level of, say, The Strokes' \\"Is this It\\" or the White Stripes' \\"Elephant;\\"  rather it was very-good-bordering-on-great.  <br /> <br />This album is more in the \\"good\\" range, sort of like the Strokes' \\"Room on Fire.\\"  Possibly a little better.  It gets off to an especially strong start with Tracks 1-5.  But then it screeches to a halt with Track 6 (\\"Only Ones Who Know\\").  Track 7 (\\"Do Me a Favor\\") is \\"OK,\\" (though it seems to lift from my least favorite track from the Strokes' US version of \\"Is This It\\", \\"When it Started\\"). <br /> <br />So after two relative clunkers, the album gets back to rocking with Track 8 -- \\"This House is a Circus.\\"  Tracks 9-11 sound pretty decent, but by this time I'm getting tired of the album and Track 12 (\\"505\\") just flat out bores me (though it does pick up somewhat). <br /> <br />Now compare this to \\"Whatever People Say...\\"  I have no problem listening to that album straight through, with the exception of \\"Riot Van,\\" which I just skip. <br /> <br />Back to the Strokes' comparison:  I think one thing, in addition to its retro-production, that separate the Strokes' \\"Is this It\\" from other bands' efforts is Julian Casablancas' vocals, which are historically great IMHO.  On both Arctic Monkeys' albums, I like Alex Turner's vocals, but I don't love them.  Moreover, I can't make up my mind about the ArcticMonkey's drummer, Matt Helders:  I love his work on \\"Brianstorm,\\" but then sometimes I think he doesn't really do much to \\"fill in\\" the songs (in all fairness, the Strokes' Fab Moretti isn't the next John Bonham either and the White Stripes' Meg White...well..no need to go there). <br /> <br />That said, I saw these guys live at the Hammerstein Ball Room two weeks ago and they absolutely rocked.  They are one heckuva live band.  They rocked MUCH HARDER than Jack White's other current musical vehicle, the Raconteurs, whom I saw last Summer.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|Jeff Tweedy has always held a strange fascination for me since the Tupelo days. His voice was more alluring than Farrar's, and when Wilco began his songs were much more interesting than Son Volt. No one can argue that Tweedy has been more experimental and more daring than Farrar since the Tupelo split. Yankee and Ghost were hard for me to swallow but probably endured longer. I actually think Yankee wasn't that original and was over hyped, but Ghost was certainly a change. <br /> <br />Now we have a quite confusing movement in Sky. There has been talk about how this sounds organic, like six or whatever guys in a room, but I feel like it's stilted and too glossy, or maybe superficial. OK, You Are My Face and Impossible Germany have Ghost resonances, but they sound out of place with the overall tempo of the album. When I first heard What Light on the internet I felt I was going to fall asleep. On and On and On does just that. The mid-piece Please Be Patient With Me has an ironic, albeit unintentional, side message to it.  <br /> <br />So what do we get out of it? To be honest I could do without Nels Cline, who really sparkled on the recent live album, but here sounds like he's trying to spark fire in a very drenched basement. The extra keyboard players are interesting to a point. Then we have Tweedy, whose lyrics often are cryptic but hardly literary--here they threaten to sound just banal against the banal compositions he chooses. <br /> <br />The defense, I guess, is that Tweedy has found a happy place. This seems too safe to me. I don't want personal tragedy to overcome him, but there are other ways of approaching folky alt-country: like spooky, haunting, atmopsheric. I will buy every Wilco album as they come out but this one has stalled me a bit--and yes, I have listened to it around twenty times without a change of heart.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|They should have waited another 2 years. This cd is bad at best. I can't even explain how disappointed I am.
B000O5AYCA|4.0|There have been a lot of unnecessarily complicated accounts of how The National have evolved as a band from their first album to this one.  <br /> <br />Put quite simply, it's been a movement from alt-country (think experimental like Wilco) to alt-country mixed with influences like Joy Division/New Order.  <br /> <br />To begin with the alt-country was top heavy but then songs like Murder Me Rachel and Abel showed the Joy Division/New Order influences coming through. In Alligator this strange mix of genres was at times a little jarring. <br /> <br />Now, in Boxer, they've come together more successfully and less strenuously. Songs like Fake Empire, Mistaken for Strangers, Brainy, Squalor Victoria, Apartment Story, even Guest Room have those Joy Division tendencies, with some experimentation and embellishments. The rest--Green Gloves, Slow Show, Start A War, Racing Like a Pro, Ada, Gospel--are basically alt-country, again with some experimentation and embellishments. My favorite Joy Division-ish numbers are probably Fake Empire and Squalor Victoria (the latter sounding almost Kinks-ish in composition, the former having a neat horns section at the end), and my favorite alt-country numbers are probably Slow Show with its piano break, and either the understated Starting A War or Racing Like A Pro. For my liking, though, Apartment Story seems like too much of a Joy Division clone and Gospel is just plain boring in conception. <br /> <br />The National, overall, are a vital group to watch as they hone these two very different styles and try to create different interpretations with them.

B000063Y8F|4.0|There's no doubt that the Rosle is extremely good--in fact, I would have given it five stars just a few weeks ago. But then I purchased the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press (#2315), after reading a recent review of it in Cook's Illustrated. After repeatedly comparing the two side-by-side, the Kuhn is unquestionably the better press. It's also about $8 cheaper here on Amazon, but that's just a bonus--I didn't consider price for this review.<br /><br />What's strange is that the crushing mechanisms appear to be identical. In fact, prior to crushing with the Kuhn, I felt disappointed when I received it, convinced that I had just bought the same garlic press twice. However, for whatever reason (and it remains a mystery to me), the Kuhn's crushing of garlic is clearly superior in two ways: 1) It produces a more beautifully consistent mince of the garlic, whereas the result from the Rosle seems more \\"smashed\\" by comparison. The difference isn't subtle--I was honestly shocked by it. 2) The pressing is more complete, with less left behind in the hopper, and it presses unpeeled garlic better, as well. (That said, I get a much better press from either unit with peeled cloves.)<br /><br />Ergonomically, the shape of the Kuhn also handles better, although I never had a problem with the Rosle. And I'd say both units have stainless steel construction of equally high quality. For me, it was the crushing performance and not the handling that has sadly relegated my Rosle to the drawer, since I now always reach first for the Kuhn.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|We just upgraded to some $9000 speakers for our high end stereo system. Listening to the original Beatles music on CD leaves a lot to be desired with today's better technology. This brought it all into the present. A Beatles \\"purist\\" may not like having their music mixed up, but you still get the same Beatles genius in this music. I don't see where anything is lost. It is all new again. I love it.
B000002GOZ|5.0|Acoustically, this is a gorgeous album. I didn't think it was possible, but it is. \\"When You Love Someone\\" is my most favorite song from Bryan Adams and the only one I have ever actually purchased. I love that song because I have lived the lyrics far too many times, and keep hoping that one day I will \\"learn to do things better.\\" But at least, after hearing Brian's take on \\"when you love someone\\" I realize that I'm not the \\"only one out there\\" (stupid or not). For that I am eternally gratefully and forever in his debt!<br /><br />[ BRYAN ADAMS Lyrics ]<br /><br />\\"When you love someone\\"<br /><br />When you love someone - you'll do anything<br /><br />you'll do all the crazy things that you can't explain<br /><br />you'll shoot the moon - put out the sun<br /><br />when you love someone<br /><br />you'll deny the truth - believe a lie<br /><br />there'll be times that you'll believe you can really fly<br /><br />but your lonely nights - have just begun<br /><br />when you love someone<br /><br />when you love someone - you'll feel it deep inside<br /><br />and nothin else can ever change your mind<br /><br />when you want someone - when you need someone<br /><br />when you need someone...<br /><br />when you love someone - you'll sacrifice<br /><br />you'd give it everything you got and you won't think twice<br /><br />you'd risk it all - no matter what may come<br /><br />when you love someone<br /><br />you'll shoot the moon - put out the sun<br /><br />when you love someone
B000O178BY|5.0|Legendary Nine Inch Nails wizard Trent Reznor has undergone rehab in the past few years to battle alcoholism, what emerged was a more focused and stronger artist, this was especially evident in the impressive 2005 release \\"With Teeth\\" which announced Reznor's return as one of the best hard rock artists of all time. But apparently with saving his health Reznor also managed to really get a clear view of our modern world in his head. The result is the masterful, roaring \\"Year Zero\\" which has some of NIN's best music since \\"The Fragile\\" and will also stand as one of the definitive hard rock recordings of the Bush era. \\"Year Zero\\" is like George Orwell's \\"1984\\" for 2007 as Reznor paints a world taken over by corporate fascism and greed, presided over by a maniacal dictator aligned with the religious right (sound familiar?) who could care less about the world going to waste, he's already sold his soul to the dollar. Reznor manages to construct this scenario with snarling riffs, driving beats and cryptive, visual lyrics. There is almost a cinematic feel to the way the album flows with songs like \\"Survivalism\\" creating a vivid picture of Reznor's story if not of our world as it really is. \\"The Beginning Of The End\\" has some ripping guitars and a solid drum beat that shows Reznor's abilities at more traditional forms of hard rock, but from there on it's a dark journey of experimental sounds forming a tale of the near future. \\"The Good Soldier\\" has a catchy, funky beat while \\"Capital G\\" rips along with anger and fury as the lyrics give us an inside view into men like George Bush and Dick Cheney. \\"Year Zero\\" stands alongside Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" as a record that captured the way we felt, the things we suspected, and the facts we already knew about our system and culture. Even more disturbing is the possibility, the very real possibility, that \\"Year Zero\\" could prove to be prophetic. With great electronica mixed with live instruments and sneaky, sometimes very expressive vocals, Trent Reznor captures the FEELINGS of the Bush era, this is the soundtrack to the Iraq war and Noam Chomsky's worst nightmares. This is a hard rockin' scorcher for those who just want to rock out, for the normal NIN hearts in darkness out there, but it is also one of the most creative and important albums of this year if not the last decade. Highly recommended not just to NIN fans but students of Orwell, Arundhati Roy and yes, Chomsky. \\"Year Zero\\" is ferocious, intelligent and unforgettable.
B000HT386M|5.0|Adam Sandler is hilarious in this movie from the dogs to when he gets fatter than life!! Get this movie!!
B00005JPLU|4.0|If you are in the mood for a lot of violence, and prefer fantasy to history, then this movie is a lot of fun.  It is based on a comic book, and you can almost see the comic book frames in the movie, for example in the fight scenes which alternately speed up and slow down, and in the otherworldly processing of the colors.  There is a lot of testosterone-soaked dialogue, e.g. King: \\"My heart is broken by your loss.\\"  Captain: \\"Heart?  I have filled my heart with hate.\\"  King: \\"Good.\\"  The priests and the persians, that is to say the enemies of the protagonists, appear as deformed monsters.  If this bothers you, bear in mind that the story is filtered through an ancient Greek narrator, and historians of that time such as Herodotus apparently had a tendency to exaggerate and to blend history with fantasy.  The movie breaks up the epic battle scenes with scenes of political maneuvering back in Sparta.  The latter provide good opportunities for rest room breaks, but don't miss the council meeting, where the tough as nails Spartan queen really shines.

0743496728|5.0|i stumbled upon this book while i was flipping through People magazine and was immediately intrigued. <br /> <br />without giving away anything, i can merely say that the plotline of this story flowed thought-provikingly and quickly, just my speed. it broached upon new topics that have been rarely touched upon, and delved into the mental state of the perp- or was he the victim?- which few authors tend to do as well as Piccoult did. <br /> <br />i was personally not a fan of the ever-acclaimed \\"my sister's keeper\\", in fact, the only other Piccoult book i would recommend reading is \\"the tenth circle\\". all of the others seem to be nice stories, but extremely predictable and borderline redundant after the first few, which was why i was enormously surprised at the amazingness of this book. <br /> <br />after reading this, i lent it to 3 friends. all of them adored it. Piccoult really outdoes herself this time, as Nineteen Minutes is by far the greatest book i've read. it never gets old, and it grabs the reachers attention by discussing topics that many others have shied away from. a msut read for all!
B00005JPAO|3.0|Good acting but this is not a good story movie.  There is no climax and resolution.  The film just sort of......ends.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Many of Jane Austen's books have been through the process of adaptation from the book to the screen.  A personal favorite for Pride and Prejudice is the ministries made by BBC. Of course, many purists will object to the lack of adherence to the book in this particular adaptation however they seem to miss out on one word in the description, \\"based.\\" The movie is BASED on the book. No matter if you've never read Pride and Prejudice in your life and are seeing the film for the first time, or you've read all of Austen's work and own many adaptations that you yourself enjoy, this version is just as charming and profound, odd as those two words sound in a sentence. The imagery and music certainly make up for the lack of certain plot devices and characters. The on-screen chemistry between the lead actors, Keira Knightly and Mathew MacFayden, is dynamic in many scenes. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good romance and learning a lession or two along the way!
B000P0J02E|5.0|If at all possible when \\"reviewing\\" discs, or anything else on here how about sticking to an actual review? Too often I see people post useless crap that has nothing to do with the product itself. I suppose this \\"review\\" could be included in that as well. My point is this, review the material and leave it at that. Nothing is more frustrating than sitting down to read this stuff only to find someone bashing Hans Zimmer (or whoever else) instead of giving an actual opinion of the material presented. Just my two cents. Feel free to let the hate begin as I know this will spark some controversy.  <br /> <br />For what it's worth, the soundtrack is great!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Sky Blue Sky is the album to get for 2007.  Why?   <br /> <br />1) Great melodies <br />2) Amazing Guitar solos <br />3) Beautiful and haunting songs <br />4) Tweedy's vocals sound great <br /> <br />Not convinced enough?  Okay, I'll add my input <br /> <br />First of all, the album is very mellow, but at times, its energetic, and it just rocks.  Some of the faster tunes such as \\"Walken\\" and \\"Impossible Germany\\" are classics for the album.  Both have amazing guitar solos and hooks that are extremely catchy.  Other songs on the album start off slow, but they seem to progress into a beautifully written landscape with more awesome guitar solos and more chord structures and layering.   <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Side with the Seeds\\", \\"You are my face\\", and \\"Shake it off\\" start off slow, but progress into catchy melodies.  In Shake it off, they differentiate the meter, switching up the 4/4 beat into series of different meters and going back to the original.   <br /> <br />Other songs are just beautifully written ballad songs like \\"Either Way\\" and \\"Please Be Patient with Me\\".  Its very acoustic and it shows Tweedy's vocals very well. <br /> <br />My favorite song off the album is \\"On and On and On\\".  It is eerie, dark, yet happy.  Its about being with someone else forever and for you to go on and on in life.  The lyrics and how its sang is very catchy and the melody stays in your head.  I love how the song progresses harder and uses different instruments.   <br /> <br />You should definately listen to this more than a few times.  It grows on you more and more.  Compared to the music out there currently, its nothing you've heard of.  It's folky, classic rock, and its awesome.  It has a 60ish and 70's vibe.  You'll love this album.   <br /> <br />By the way, if you buy this album on Itunes, you get an additional song that's not on the actual cd.  If you get the CD, you might want to pick up that one song and purchase it.  It's a fast song, and kinda different from Sky Blue Sky.
1591841666|5.0|I first read Purple Cow and got excited (and implemented quite a few ideas from it). Then I read Free Prize Inside and got MORE excited (and implemented more). Then I read The Big Moo and was ecstatic. I bought and read The Dip in one day. I've gotta tell you, your books have such an impact on me. I'm one of those folks who read even just one line of a book and the ideas just start flowing. <br /> <br />I had gotten to the point in my business where I felt like I wasn't going anywhere or moving as quickly or making as many sales as I could/should be. After reading The Dip, I tackled my business with the renewed enthusiasm and voracity that a high school linebacker takes on a rival quarterback during the Big game. Within 48 hours of reading The Dip, not only was I back on track to make more this month than I have all year, but I'm excited about doing it. <br /> <br />Short book be damned, The Dip was worth the read (and I've read it 3 times since then!) Thank you for giving me permission to lean into the Dip and overcome my self-inflicted slump. 2007 is shaping up to be even better than any year before! <br /> <br />I'm a big Dan Kennedy fan as well and one of the things he says is that wealth attraction is all about Massive, Simultaneous Action. It was only in being able to implement the suggestions and observations you made during The Dip that has allowed me to move forward. I hope your other readers are as excited about this book as I am! <br /> <br />
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Hi I'am a super huge fan of linkin park I have all their cd's. And was expecting like all of you to get a listen of linkin park new cd. I heard What I've done and I thought: hey is not bad. But once I got a hold on the cd I was in total shock!!<br /><br />It completely lack of the formula that made Linkin park to grow in to be the most sucessful band in the world!<br /><br />I don't know what they were thinking, I keep on looking in the near future so they can realize the big mistake they have made and fix it.<br /><br />Overall, there are just like one or two songs with the sound of the first cd's of the band!<br /><br />Not recommend buying unless you want to have all the cd's.
B000BCE7QU|5.0|This record is a pop mastepiece.  Not only has it held up well over the years, but it's taken on a beautiful mystical aura unlike anything from the 80's. The 80's were filled with great rock records, but as far as the pop side of music goes, this record is the cream of the crop..    Frankly I've grown so accustomed to the bonus tracks \\"The Yearning Loins\\" and \\"He'll Have to GO' on the American version of SMcQ  (titled 'Two Wheels Good) as a regular part of the record.   \\"He'll Have To Go\\", a bonus track and one of the Sprout's best, the song that won me over initially as a Prefab fan, rounds out the record-long meditation on the male condition beautifully.     On the American side of the fan fence, it's wonderful to hear great old tunes with a fresh polish, but I'm still holding onto my copy of Two Wheels Good.  I like the title better (and Thomas Dolby's vision and contribution aside)  the non-Dolby produced bonus tracks  really do make a big difference.    When I first heard Paddy McAloon was re-recording acoustic versions of the songs I groaned. But when I finally heard them, it was an amazing experience. I never realized just how great \\"Appetite\\" was until I heard the demo. And the version of \\"Desire As\\", is incredible. \\"When Love Breaks Down\\" should be on heavy rotation at Starbucks. We'll see ...
B000002J03|5.0|Another CD  filled with GENIUS ! OH, and...LUST ! These two are so passionate,.<br /><br />These songs REALLY COMMUNICATE !!!!!<br /><br />I painted one room's mural to this CD.<br /><br />Truly effective music.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is amazing!  It really brings into sharp focus the peril that our planet is in, and why it is worth saving.  It is, take-your-breath-away amazing!
B000002J09|5.0|Masterpiece, Robert's singing seems more Emotional and Inspiring than opera !<br /><br />Black Dog and Going to California are my particular favorites on this CD. Sung with his needy , yearning, whining soul !<br /><br />Got to buy it !
B000P2A256|4.0|After wearing out just about every possible radio format since 2004, Maroon 5 has returned with the follow up to their debut \\"Songs About Jane\\" (essentially a break-up album encompassing a failed relationship of lead singer Adam Levine). With their sophomore effort \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long,\\" Maroon 5 steps away from the heartache and pain of their previous effort and opts for a more lively, upbeat vibe. Don't get me wrong, you still get your dose of power pop ballads like \\"Won't Go Home Without You,\\" a standout song that is most likely destined to be the third single, and bluesy songs like \\"Back At Your Door,\\" a jazzy number that really shows off the versatility this band possesses. It is songs like the first single \\"Makes Me Wonder,\\" and the sure fire second single \\"Little of Your Time,\\" both upbeat catchy songs that you can't help but at least tap your feet when listening to them, that make up the overall feel of \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\"<br /><br />While this album may lack the depth in quality songs that their debut possessed, with their sophomore effort, Maroon 5 has established themselves as a band that is willing to be creative and journey outside their comfort zones as artists. It is a certainty that this album will be spun endlessly on all radio formats until the boys decide to put out number three. So here's to hoping the gap in between album two and album three is much narrower than the gap between between album one and album two was. Overall, a solid sophomore effort from a solid band.
1400063515|5.0|A great read.  A philosophy book that is filled with great insight and wonderful humor.  Generally a relatively easy read, Black Swan nevertheless is stimulating and thought provoking.   There is little question that we do need to be aware of the black swan.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|La película es una belleza de las mejores que he visto en mi vida.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|CD is fine, but some of the music that was in the movie does not exist on the CD.... Too bad,,,,
B000O178BY|5.0|Awesome CD, what's cool about it is that it's heat sensitive. The music is Awesome no bad cd has ever come from Trent Reznor.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Just received my order for the Planet Earth DVD and I'm extremely happy with the purchase....Some of the grandkids have watched it with me and  were very entertained....This is something I hope all of my family will enjoy for years to come....
B000MQ54OO|5.0|great movie, great features. Plays in the xbox 360 hd-dvd add-on no problem.
B00005O5CM|3.0|Cases can hinge on haircare--and not everyone is as they seem.  The film was mindless fun on one level, but teaches you really do need to look a little bit deeper sometimes.   <br /> <br />Clearly it's fantasy, but a lot of fun.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|A super entertaining CD...I recommend for anyone who enjoys their music...and this from me, who NEVER (well, Almost never) BUYS a DVD or CD! <br /> <br />Kudos, ladies...
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This series is excellent.  I will never understand why Fox executives canceled the series.  The DVD set only gets 4 stars due to the average DVD menus and content.  I wanted to see more than just the outtakes and commentaries.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Clear voices, a fantastic fiddler and a super selection of tunes makes this a \\"must have\\" for the Celtic music affecionado. Brava, ladies!
B000P2A256|4.0|This new CD hasn't come out of my car cd player since it arrived last week. It is pop rock at its finest -- while it doesn't live up to Maroon 5's first album, almost every cut on it is entertaining and catchy -- it's a joy to watch this band develop and grow. This album mixes hip hop, pop rock, a little jazz, a little alt rock to create it's own style. Most of the songs on this album have that \\"you done me wrong but I love you anyway\\" theme to them, so you have to wonder what's going on with Adam Levine and Co in the love department...but it doesn't matter, I'm singing along with every cut.
B0007M22TI|5.0|These ladies know how to entertain! Very clear voices and a good selection of tunes makes this a winner. We enjoy every one of their CD's and we look forward to attending a live concert this weekend! Buy with confidence.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I like Michael Buble, but this CD is rather bland -- a couple of the tracks fall flat. I do enjoy the title cut, and several of the others. The orchestra sounds wonderful, and Michael's voice is wonderful as usual. This is an album that needed some better song selection.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|This film confounds me.  How can it be so chaotic and uneven and yet still force me to watch again and again. <br /> <br />The DiCaprio storyline is pretty flawless, but the Damon storyline fall flat.  The idea of this two mirroring each other fails because the tension in Damon's life never reaches the level of DiCaprio's. <br /> <br />DiCaprio getting caught means death.  Damon getting caught means... maybe jail.  Bad yes, but not devastating.
