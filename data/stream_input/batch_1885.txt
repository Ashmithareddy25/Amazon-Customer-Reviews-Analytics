B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Was great having all episodes in one place so we could watch them all at once. The only problem was the need for so much popcorn,  ha ha
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We like this game pretty well. this is an add to the main game and will get some more game addes to go with the main board game.
B001KZIRL8|4.0|Funny spin on relationships these days really enjoyed the story and plot of the movie the cast had good chemistry. Good date movie
0060254920|5.0|A classic picture storybook, a little off-beat, but wonderful.  My grown children loved it when they were young and now I'm giving it to my grandchildren.
B0091WL8TA|5.0|Excellent! I have enjoyed watching it several times.I never get tired of Elvis.i could listen to him everyday.He was so gorgeous.
1426308469|4.0|My nephew is three and he likes this book. The book covers an array of different dinosaurs and not just the large dinosaurs.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|surprised my wife with this one. It was one of her favorite movies growing up. She was thrilled to get it
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I got this for my wife because she loves it. I never saw it, but now we watch it together.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|If you like Seth Mc Farlands humor you will like this movie.<br />Not for kids or the faint of heart.<br />I would reccomend!
B001WPOPNA|5.0|Christmas present to a friend it was received sooner than i thought and would def order again from this person.
B000MD9UJC|3.0|not bad, but feels loose. It does what it says and I like having the thumb button on the bottom
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|Got this for my grandson (7) for Christmas 2012.  He loves the entire Nerf line.  The problem is finding them - all over the place.  Drives his Grandma crazy.  Nerf products only last a short time, however, children of ages 6 & up (to 66) love em!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The Batman movies just keep getting better, this one was awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and their is action throughout. 5 stars!
160774273X|5.0|Very good book if interested in artisan bread making.  And perhaps good read if considering starting a small bakery or Pizza shop.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|My husband and I love it.  I am tossing out my old alarm clock today.  It is easy to use and the advertisements are not intrusive.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I don't really need to rate Big Bany Theory, because at this point in the series you buy it because you like it. However, what I was impressed with was the customer service of Amazon.  The first copy I received was damaged and would not play correctly.<br />I was able to contact Amazon by email, print a return label and have a new copy in a week without any hassle.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was too short of a book but other than that it was good. Btw i got to puke bye
B000ROALCG|5.0|I don't see how the movie was mediocre to some, but I really enjoyed it. Perhaps becaue it was J.Lo and Marc, but I thought they perfomed well. Anywho, I like the cd because Marc brought life into Lavoe's music. I put in on when Im cleaning or in a good mood. Great CD and movie!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Jim Carrey was entertaning as usually. Funny and the kids were entertained. How can you go wrong with Dr. Suess?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good book, a different spin on the \\"normal\\" drunk night in Vegas leading to marriage of strangers.
B0086700CM|5.0|Grandchildren pick this game they both love it and they did give me a turn and I can see that you can get hooked on this game, but I am sure it will take me a while to get as good as the younger kids.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|I never knew how funny this movie was, so glad I took a chance on it! Oh and kids will love it too!
B002BJGYUS|5.0|I love Gilmore so I was excited to find season 1 for a great price.  I love this season a lot.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is really fun and very addictive! I love it and have been playing for several months. There are, however, several things that need improvement. 1. Actions (breeding, hatching, expanding, etc) take WAY too long. 2. Expanding and clearing are WAY too expensive. 3. If you're not using an IOS, it seems you're missing out on a lot because many of the updates/new items/new dragons/etc apply only to those using an IOS.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really loved this story. I was happy to read a story where's man really showed his feelings and then he expressed them
B008KW43TE|5.0|He is raw and talented. Its a rare gift in the music industry these days. Plus he is not afraid of being himself!
B0002S943O|5.0|This dvd is fantastic.  They sound great, they look great... I watch it often.  I highly, highly recommend this dvd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Sucks you in! Just read it. I had listened to family and friends go on and on and I finally caved in. Great series!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't help but to love this book, had me going from day one. Intriguing , vivid imagery and a well plot scheme
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game is addicting.  At first it seems easy but quickly gets more challenging.  Fun game to pass the time however I took 1 star away because occasionally the game crashes.
0205313426|4.0|I have a friend that needed some help with writing letters, so I decided to purchase the book for him.
B003TT2X72|5.0|Needed to replace my UK region DVDs.  Don't know why I didn't do this sooner!  Always a great movie to watch on a dreary winter day.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is the best book ever!!! I Belive it is a great book of the Diary of wimpy kid!!<br /><br />  BY,<br />ALEXIS CLARK
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat and biting my nails it was so suspenseful!  I would recommend this movie.
0823015017|5.0|I am reading it, and every chapter is very understandable, teaches you how to coordinate colour and and how to reach to the colour desired, very interesting.<br />It was delivered on time and the package was perfect, it arrive in perfect conditions.<br />Thank you<br />Moraima
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I've always wanted to play the piano, and this makes it easier to learn.  I can use the piano master along with my keyboard to really get a true feel for piano playing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I don't know about anyone else but mine took forever to download but other than that the app was good
B00005JLKB|5.0|If you haven't seen the first season of Smallville this is really good because it starts from when Superman begins.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|No plot, no story-line, expected better from &#34;Marky Mark&#34; and Mark Wahlberg :)  And now I need  more words to complete this review.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|It was great but sad. I cried but when it comes to sad books I'm  cryer. I recommend it to those who enjoyed The Fault In Our Stars by John Green.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's pretty good it needs lower prices and more battles other than that it is good and has great graphics
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|some historial facts altered but other wise good movie.  with so much written about Elizabeth nice to to here about a different queen
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I very very much enjoy the soundtrack. I had never seen Les Mis before i saw this version, but i had heard many of the songs. Then i saw the movie and now i am in love with all of it. i had to buy the soundtrack immediately. While the tracks that are included are great, why is it only the highlights? id rather pay more for the whole thing, but it seems i didnt have that option. I have a hunch that maybe the full soundtrack will be released in the future, and then ill be compelled to buy that too. Perhaps that is not the case, but it seems like a money trap set up for the impatient, which i admittedly am.<br />Anyway this soundtrack is great and i havent stopped listening to it since i watched the film.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has quickly become one of my new favorite authors.  Gone Girl is a page turner and has a great ending.  I'm currently reading Sharp Objects which I'm loving almost as much as Gone Girl.  Way to go, Gillian!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book overall. However, a bit hard to follow in some areas and not nearly as addicting as the two prior.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|not a kids movie. i am open mined to different takes on stories.  This one was interesting and gets you thinking.
B000HT3P7E|3.0|The season is a great season. I gave this as a gift, but when it arrived the case inside was broken...If the case was not broken I would have given it more stars.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved Wild and have recommended this story to several friends.  As an advid hiker myself, it was exciting to read her experiences on the PCT.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a great and the neatest book I have seen.  I hope other people will  like this book as  much as I  do thanks for  reading this.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Just what I would exspect when these 2 get together.  I was a teenager when orginal series aired, had to rush home from school.  Story left open ended so maybe there will be a follow up.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|So smart they are dumb I love it, and watching penny excessively being tormented but g these are now here friends and she is accidentally getting smarter
B00ANAC32U|1.0|This is $20 on the Google play store  suggest you wait it out till they have more in stock or if you really want to buy this but you are gonna pay way too much
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was really.good. Suzanne Collins did a great job.I liked how she makes the ends so suspenseful to make you want to keep reading
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Decent action movie but a little soulless compared to the original. Going to stick to the Arnie version in blu-ray.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Story was good but too much technical stuff that was a bit boring before you find out what is going on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it looking forward to the next book<br />And the second installment in November 2013<br /><br />Once u read this it makes you want more of what life will hold for everyone in district 12
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book. Better than the movie. I recommend it to people who love twilight. I'm going to read the next two books totally!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|2 of my favorite movies and Oceans 12  wrapped up in one collection. In blue ray format  for high def.

1933308087|5.0|Well organized and useful reference book that will inspire you to create your own masterpiece! A must for every quilter's library.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Enjoy playing this game very much just not real good at it but keep trying to play that's how much i enjoy it all my family is also crazy about it, but alot better than me. So will keep trying to play
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is the best near death book I have ever read. Bridges the gap between science and spirituality.
B007B6VOG0|3.0|I bought this because I loved Some Night and We Are Young, and I still do.  But, I wasn't too impressed with the rest of the album.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Mr Galdwell, lays out specifically why some of our greatest Icon's succeed where others do not.<br /><br />In a time when some people say if you're not rich its your own fault, Mr Galdwell shows where people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were in the right place at the right time with the right passion. I have taken his 10,000 hour rule to heart, as I am attempting to learn piano.<br /><br />Sometimes it is our own inspiration, our own get up and go that takes us to new heights of success, but sometime its as simple as a rule on how old you need to be to start playing hockey as to when you can get on the hockey team. Sometimes those rules stop you before you get started or they are the very door to your success.<br /><br />I could go on but let me say this... I think if you have children, this is a must read. If you want to understand how to master aspects of your own life this is a must read.<br /><br />I think Gladwell is a genius, but then he probably has more than 10,000 hours practice at it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I think I play Solitare in my sleep however it plays better using this type Solitare (Awake, on a Kindle!!).
B004KKX814|4.0|very good condition and arrived very quickly perfect arm it cost me but it was very well spectacular mind well and arrived on time for Christmas Eve I like colors, and super tough
B009JBWOU0|5.0|My son is a huge Batman fan and was so excited and surprised that he got the just released &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; as  part of a trilogy for Christmas.  He thinks I'm awesome!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read 50 shades.  This series is hot as well!  No whips and leather.  Though the story line for this one is just as good.  I am looking forward to the 3rd book in the series now.  I would like to know where these men are!  I want to walk up to a guy and feel the kind of attraction these two feel so intensly!  (Sorry Hubby!)
B006TJXZ30|3.0|my husband likes it. I'm not really into email, but he uses it a lot and checks my email for me.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Wonderful movie. I gave it as a gift to my mother and my daughter and they were so happy. The packaging is beautiful and I love the tidbits of information on the inside cover about the movie.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Magical and Fun! This App is enchanting... even 5 years ago... this beautiful product would have made headlines.  Humanity has made such quick progress since the mid 90's.  This App should inspire our young future scientists to get working.  &#34;One Small&#34; Step to bring the Cosmos to the Masses!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I saw a preview for this book as a movie at the theater.  I wrote down the name of the book and purchased it right there with my kindle!  What a great story!  And surprising!  There are times you think you know what will happen, wrong!  Other times the main character does something you know she would do because you want to do it.  I am on the third book in the series now.  I hope the movie is good, but I don't care.  I am enjoying the series of books!  Thank you.  Characters are great, so many different personalities.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I'm a weather geek. I like Accuweather, but still use the brouser to use my Professional subscription. You  know weather forecasters. They can be wrong most of the time and still keep their jobs. I check several sites and make up my own mind.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|My husband loved it.  He has been a big Led Zeppelin fan since he was a teenager.  Has most of their other CD's.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Just Amazing Choices & No Problems !  There is nothing I can say to describe my surprise with this App.  My Samsung Note 2 is even a better companion on my journeys through our world.
B00846REIS|5.0|Watch out 50 shades, you have competition!  This series is so hot you will burn your fingers!  This book had a great main story line just like 50 shades.  This one doesn't have the whips and such...  But there is a story of pain and love, and trust.  Just once I want to meet a man like this!  Alone.  In an elevator. PLEASE!!!  Are there men like this out there?<br />Great book!  A must read for women and men!!!!!!
B008K6HN8I|2.0|It was recommended, but haven't really found a purpose. I will be trashing it soon. It seems to be just taking up space.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not stop once I started!! There were moments I laughed and some I wanted to cry. Wonderfully written!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I ordered this and also a separate CPU fan (Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler). I didn't realize this already comes with a CPU fan. Had I known (had I looked at the pictures -- don't see it in the description) I might have not ordered a separate CPU fan.<br /><br />Having said that the CPU fan that comes with it is very basic. My CPU temp hovers around 40-45 degrees C in room temperature, under light load. Since this CPU can be overclocked fairly easily, you might want to invest in a good CPU fan.<br /><br />In my case I'm keeping the Cooler Master and not returning it -- since it is a much better fan.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I was hooked after watching the highly-anticpated Pilot on TV. The songs drew me in, they were modernized and awesome! At the end of the pilot, they sang Journey's &#34;Don't Stop Believin'&#34; and I. Fell. In. Love. Lea Michele's voice is quite amazing, I don't know how she can hit those notes. The wittyness of this show is insane. The writers really hit gold with this show and this season in particular!!! Great show to watch, although may be inappropriate for younger than 14.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|works really  good. Great for birthday and Christmas shopping. I've listed items watched things and bought things. I like it a lot.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's cute and easy, but still challenging enough to appeal to both younger and older audiences! In fact, it's my favorite app!<br />^_^ /)
030759565X|2.0|I heard the review on the radio and it sounded great. Upon receiving the book I am very dissappointed. I probably won't make anything in it.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Another great book by Ken Follett, once you start reading it, you don't want to put it down, thoroughly enjoyed.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|good app Not much to say, It shows what it is supposed  to show. I don't use it to keep track of my schedule.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|well all the people that say this thing isn't good y'all this thing is the best so you should think about what you reviewed about it.To me its a five star product and that's all u got to say.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This was a good movie to sit on the couch and enjoy with the wife. Instant service was great as well
B00280LYHS|5.0|Wassup readers of this book!!!!!I am so happy about this series.there is another series called the heroes of Olympus. If you liked this series you should read it!!!!!
B000002KBU|5.0|Efficient purchasing methods. Goods arrived from overseas well before the prescribed time. Quality  of recording is as good as the original. Recommend this vbenue for purchase
B003O86FMW|5.0|That was one of the best books I ever read!<br />It was very interesting I just couldn't put it down!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This is a long movie and not very interesting.  It lacks the typical spy movie excitement that one would expect
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This a cute and fun game for kids around age 4/5. I dont understand why a game geared towards such little kids requires them to make an actual purchase in order to ahead in a game. That should be changed.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Good quality recording. As good as new. Efficient pay method, fast postage, . Goods arrived a week earlier than anticipated. I recommend this venue for purchase.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've read every diary of a wimpy kid book so far but this one by far was the best one out of all of them.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|My special person was tickeled pink. Her favorite type of movie is horror; she also likes thrillers. It was the perfect gift for her.  jannz
0792163710|5.0|One of the best Westerns ever made enough said.Alan Ladd as a drifter/ gunfighter Shane is at his greatest role.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is about how a guy named Barry Steakfries is going to work a t a secret lab when in the window he sees a machine gun jet pack and he's dreaming of what he's going to do with it.Then he blows up the wall and steals it.THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER.!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|really love it on my iPhone but it seems that on the kindle fire it constantly gives you the option of either random, winning or losing hand for every deal. why keep asking?  keep it random all the time.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|this movie was a gift for my son who loved it. He love colorful things and music. perfect perfect perfect  jannz
B006R1T40I|4.0|I like a lot of what Bonnie Raitt produces and have seen her in concert and think she is talented and a good entertainer.  I don't buy albums very often - usually a song or two from an album on iTunes.  But when I previewed the songs on this album, I liked most of them and decided to buy the album.
B003719G40|5.0|This book is awesome!! Would recommend to any married couple!  Makes perfect sense and breaks it down so easily. Thank you!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was too amazing for words to describe, only that if you have not read it yet, your missing out on one of the most heartbreaking while warming book I ever hope to read.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Explosions, fighting, classic action stars taking on entire armies with ease. No surprises here, but a lot of fun if that's what you're looking for.
B005T87QCI|4.0|My 7 & 4 yr olds love it! they think its so cool. I have yet to really sit and watch them play but i love the HD.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Really good book.. less sex more story would be nice, but otherwise good story line, very interesting life that I never would of thought about
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Very funny and had a lot of moments where you said oh shucks<br />One of the best in the series
B009VB97EY|5.0|This is such a fun movie.  The story line is serious at times, but Channing Tatum is so impressive with what he can do with his body.  Love this movie!!
B00506NRBS|5.0|This book boils down business and alternative perspectives to the pure and simple view of doing things for the right reason. The best way I can explain the overall theme is that every endevour takes one step at a time.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. I love the free part! Dorothy and Toto are very brave
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|Not user friendly<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />..... . . . . . . . ' . . . .<br /><br />By
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Have a kindle fire and some videos would not play. Got this app and have not had a proplem with anything since
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and I highly recommend it to everyone ill also say I'm ready for updates 0.5.1 and 0.6.0
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great for kids and the reason why I chose this rating is because I've been a fan of this series and once again Jeff Kinney wrote an outstanding book!
1933633867|5.0|I am very glad that I have bought this book. It opened my eyes to the truth about humanity, economics and politics. I highly recommend this novel approach to what is wrong with the world today and how little has changed over the last 5 thousand years or perhaps even longer.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|10out of 10<br /><br />Because it was a good book.<br />It was exciting.<br />It was interesting.<br />I really like the way it was ritten.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This trilogy is my favorite. I love the Batman movies. I had to have it the moment it came out. It is definitely worth it!
B001CDLATE|5.0|I have been a fan of Baraka since I originally saw it in 70mm glory when it was first released. This blu-ray version is very, very nice on my plasma HDTV.  I had the original DVD version, and this is a noticeably better quality transfer.<br /><br />This is the blu-ray disc I reach for when I want to show off my HDTV setup to someone.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I know I am not adding anything new when I say this is a terrific book so my review is mostly to express my delight at having found this unexpected treasure on Kindle and self published.  I can compare it with Elizabeth Moon's fantasy works (Lords of the North/Paksenarrion) and Daniel Abraham's (Long Price Quartet, The Dagger and the Coin) but not much else.  Ryan also rights Scifi (like Moon) and it is equally good. I know I will reread this novel, probably a month before the next book comes out.  Truly a gem.
B000K8EQ5W|2.0|This was a boring sappy movie.  So, surprised because I only rented it bc Sandra Bulluck and Kanu Reeves was in it.  Really like both of them. Wasted my movie on this one.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He loved it. He was absolutely thrilled. He has always wanted to own this collection and now he is so happy! I definitely recommend it.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|An excellent movie with top-notch actors.  Truly a joy in entertainment!  I recommend this to any couple over the age of 50!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|As a (former) Child junkie, I would anxiously await the next volume of brain candy. Instead of developing more insight and character, Child seems to have been in a rush to push out more product. It is almost as though his publisher demanded another book, or else. The plot is miserable. The stories laughable and unbelievable, and action events have become a formula, not a joy to read.<br /><br />Avid action readers saw this happen before - with the likes of Tom Clancy. If history holds any lesson, then we can anticipate even longer, more tedious, more predictable garbage, until Child himself cannot stomach the result. Whereupon he will hire a ghost writer, or worse, a co-author to push out more garbage.<br /><br />Reading Child used to be a surprise, a joy. Now, he is as predictable as Robert Parker including a scene with shrink girlfriend \\"Susan.\\"
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It was a pretty good game, but nothing was new or better about it than the 20 year old version.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I got this for my husband. He loved it. Great movie. Great quality. He was very satisfied and recommends it to others.
B007SGM084|3.0|YAY!!! I'm finished!!!!! I had so many thoughts about this book but the one I thought the most was, 'Why is this so popular?' Second only to, 'This is boring as hell!' Third, 'Gosh, if young women read this hoping to find their own fifty shades control freak, they might think they can HEAL him. Then may find themselves dead.' This is a story. Period. Fantasy can be erotic. But these books seldom felt like erotica. Maybe that is my fibromyalgia speaking. When one lives with pain you start to realize how unsexy pain can be. I must admit that there were a couple scenes that were sexy but mostly I found myself hating the male and scared for the female.<br /><br />So... if it was so bad, why did I give it 3 stars? Because about halfway through book two it started to pick up. I started to admire Ana. I thought maybe there might be hope for Christian. But this only lasted to the middle of book three. Suddenly the crazy action/adventure was over and... the career girl was nearly the most boring character alive again. And when I thought that I was at the final chapter I found there were three more to trudge through.<br /><br />I did like that the books did a little in educating the public on BDSM but not as much as I think could have been. A small bibliography at the end leading to books and websites of information would have raised the trilogy to another star. Not that it is that hard to find those sites. It is well worth learning about the lifestyle. Honest people are on those sites to teach more than one may ever need to know. But in searching these one can learn of ones own sexuality. That is healthy for anyone to learn.<br /><br />So I don't want to discourage others to read it. Just not something I ever want to read again.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Started recording Castle on my DVR last year and then discovered I had been missing so may episodes that I had to start with the first. I will get the reamining seasons as they become affordable.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|The DVDs do not tell all the details like the TV series. You miss a LOT!  THey are good for a review.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite movies. Great quality. He loved it on blu-ray. Definitely recommend it! It's great!
B003MC5N28|3.0|Meh. Maybe because I have read a lot of dystopia now? I just found this boring. And the ending stinks! But I didn't care even then what it meant. I am not the slightest interested in reading the next book. If it came to be for free I might try. I am again sad that I can't dance to everyone else's idea of fabulous, classic clucking. But guess I must sway to my own waltzes.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Jesse Stone was a favorite even before the movies were made and Robert Parker was my favorite author. Glad that they are continuing his works with copatable authors.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|I was excited opening the box. Upon screwing the base to the stick I noticed how much slop and play there was in the action. You can twist the stick almost an 8th of a turn in either direction. I am still using the joystick I got from goodwill over this thing. If you're going to buy a joystick, spend the money and get a decent one, not this one....
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|My husband and I love this show. We had to own it so we can watch it over and over.
B005LJETYI|5.0|I finally took a time to read the book... and finished it in on  day. Its not military sci-fi as we know. Its much closer to anti-war novels, but without too strong apel. Its clever, fast paced and sometimes cruel.
141659521X|5.0|I admit, I want Vince Flynn to increase his output, but only because I love his style and devour his books in a few hours after each release.  This one is no exception.
1419705849|5.0|very good book.  One of the tope sellers, and good for children.. I recommend it and like it very much.

B007IFZU5A|4.0|This is my first Paradise Lost purchase, having read about them in several metal magazines.  I read of them being considered a doom band and not getting around to listening to them on Youtube first, I took a chance.  So now I'm a bit puzzled but not disappointed.  My idea of doom is of the Black Sabbath school, you know, with St. Vitus, Pallbearer, who are becoming big in a hurry, or Triptykon.  In that sense Paradise Lost is not doom.  The lyrics are dark and forlorn enough, and it's refreshing to hear actual vocals, even if they're rough edged, but the music too often moves along at a faster clip and makes PL a little harder to pin down, not that I want to.<br />  I hear some classic metal riffing, mainly in the chunka-chunka riffing that comes from Led Zeppelin's \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\" or Heart's \\"Barracuda\\".  I'm a sucker for that rhythm as long as it's not overused.  This is metal that embodies a broad range of style and retains a very strong songwriting approach, with the music creating melodies that give the tunes real body, along with vocals that actually sing real notes, and not just follow the bass riff around.  Sonically, I'd probably put these guys somewhere near Katatonia, but faster and a little brighter.  And for some reason, the guitars at times remind me a bit of early Mastodon.<br />  This is an album that will need repeated listens for me to embrace it as hardcore Paradise Lost fans already have, but that's a good sign.  Most of your greatest music can't be absorbed or appreciated the first time around.  \\"Tragic Idol\\" is a nice respite for headbangers looking for a few more songwriting hooks.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|interesting twist behind story, but generally uninspired book by this author. Not nearly the captivating read expected from Grisham, as compared to earlier works.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I saw this at home. I was not expecting too much and believe the general reviews were correct. This was a movie that would have benefited from seeing in the theater for 3D but would have ticked me off for the price I would have paid. I felt like the price I paid for the HD experience at home (without 3D) was appropriate. As far as the movie itself, I can't believe it is set up for a sequel.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|My husband and I love this show. We had to own it so we can watch it over and over.
0316069434|4.0|After a couple of pretty weak books, Connelly pulls this one out of his hat. It is good, not among his top ones, but clearly worth the while. I especially liked the opening, with its tense and atmospheric description of LA during the riots in 92. Then it rolls on in a good way.<br /><br />A couple of negative things:<br />- two of the chapters are pretty lame, namely when Bosch takes his daughter to the shooting range: not particularly interesting, and his daughter's reaction to the outcome is quite absurd, it seems to me. There are also a couple of musical product placements there (in those chapters) that are pretty awkward. However, these two chapters are only a very minor part of the book, of course, so don't pay too much attention to that.<br /><br />- Bosch's handling of the situation in the end, when \\"interrogating\\" a suspect, seems absurd - unless maybe if you are the author and plans to let it end with a shootout anyhow; otherwise it seems to me like it would have been a good way to destroy the whole investigation.<br /><br />There is also a reference in the end to the shooting policy of LAPD, which seems quite unbelievable to me, but I'm not familiar with the actual rules in that great city, so it may be me being ignorant in that case.<br /><br />So, all in all I enjoyed The Black Box, and think it is somewhere around 3.5. I gave it a 4 finally because I found it to be better than his last efforts.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My son liked it, but he was disappointed in the size. He wanted this more than anything this Christmas and I worked hard to find him one, but ended up paying more than Legos published price.<br /><br />Most disappointing was Lego suddenly have large quantities the day after Christmas.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|Outside of 2-3 laughs, this dreck was awful. I like Cohen. I liked Borat. This was terrible and didn't even appeal to our teenager.
B009MF56GC|5.0|My husband loves this movie. He can watch it over and over and over again. He recommends this movie to anyone.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you purchased Season I you must purchase this one! Has excellent cinematography and great evilish  manipulation by the main characters. This season evolves around Stark's oldest son Robb who wants to free his sisters from the hands of Jeffrey Baratheon. Daenerys Targaryen travels to the City of Qarth where she finds refuge for her tribe and her dragons. During her stay at Qarth something unexpected happens and she finds herself searching for her dragons instead.The young Bran Stark is left in charge of Winterfell, but the best friend of Robb Stark (Theon Greyjoy) takes control of Winterfell and hold the younger Stark hostage.Fantasy is definitely alive and powerful, there is plenty of twists and turns that leaves you wanting more and looking forward to season 3.This HBO series is worth watching!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app has a really clean user interface, that's much easier to use, and better laid out than any other office app I've tried. The menus are easy to follow, and are readily available without being in the way. For me, this was the closest any office app came to simulating a Microsoft Word type experience, only better, and in tablet form. QuickOffice and Documents To Go just didn't work as well for me. Luckily I got them all as Free Apps of the Day, so I didn't have to waste a bunch of money test driving them all. OfficeSuite was by far, the best of the three. This is the only one that's actually worth the purchase price, in my opinion. I uninstalled all the other office apps, and decided to just use this one.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This is my favorite Angry Birds so far! I would've given it 5 stars, but I didn't like how there were levels that I couldn't activate unless I paid more money.
0140274111|5.0|I was so excited to get this and read it. I love the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's. There was a love note written on the first page, but it's small, cute, and makes me laugh. I bought it used and was aware that there would be writing in it. I love the other stories in this book as well. This is a great gift for any Audrey, Capote, or Breakfast at Tiffany's fan!
B009POCFTG|5.0|William Friedkin's `Killer Joe' is one of the most shocking, vile, disgusting, sick and twisted piece of white-trash film noir that I have ever seen. I think it's also one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />The film revolves around 21 year old Chris Smith (played with hyperactive intensity by Emile Hirsch) who attempts to clear himself of a mountain of debt by hiring a hit-man to kill his estranged mother, in order to collect $50,000 of insurance money. With a gang of loan sharks threatening to take his life, time is an issue. Chris runs the idea by his father, Ansel, at the local strip joint, and while the dim-witted Ansel is hesitant at first, he ultimately agrees that it would be a great idea. The next day, Chris hires \\"Killer\\" Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to do the job for him. Joe is an detective by day, as well as a hit man on the side. He asks for an advance payment of $25,000, but Chris is unable to pay. As a result, Joe takes Chris' twenty year old sister, Dottie, as a \\"retainer\\" until he receives his money. Ansel's wife Sharla (Gina Gershon) is hesitant at first, as she doesn't trust Chris because of his tendency to be unreliable; however, she plays along regardless.<br /><br />In the meantime, Joe and Dottie enter into a sexual relationship and become quite fond of one another. This agitates Chris to no end, and before the credits roll, everything goes straight to hell in a blood-soaked, much talked about finale.<br /><br />Make no mistake - this film earns the NC-17 rating and then some. It is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. The notorious \\"chicken leg\\" scene is just as abhorrent and disturbing as you've probably heard, and is the sole reason for the NC-17 rating. William Friedkin is on top of his game here and pulls no punches. The sordid lives of these disgusting characters are graphically brought to the screen, written for the screen by Tracey Letts' in an adaptation of his stage play. This Southern-gothic noir is beautifully shot by Caleb Deschanel, and the score by Tyler Bates is appropriately twangy and unsettling.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly amazing. McConaughey is at the top of his game here. This is an Oscar worthy performance, unlike anything that the actor has every accomplished before. Gina Gershon is incredible in her role as the double-crossing Sharla. Juno Temple is in full-on Lolita-mode as Dottie, creating a complex character with many unpredictable quirks. Thomas Hayden Church plays against type as the stupid, southern-fried redneck, Ansel. Finally, Emile Hirsch is fantastic as Chris, delivering his best performance since his underrated contribution to `Milk'.<br /><br />`Killer Joe' is a fantastic film, but once again, it is only for the brave. The faint hearted and easily offended are advised to steer clear.<br /><br />`Killer Joe' is 1 hour and 45 minutes, rated NC-17 for \\"graphic disturbing content involving violence and sexuality, and a scene of brutality\\", released by Lionsgate. Available on Blu-ray and DVD.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I like using this app while shopping just to make sure I can't get a better price elsewhere.  If I can, then I order it from Amazon right there on my phone in whatever store we're shopping at. Sometimes, the prices are better in store, so this app helps me feel like I'm getting the best deals on what I'm shopping for.  It's good to also check reviews on the fly to make sure I'm buing something worth my while.  This one is a must-have app.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Love this show and I got a good deal on this blu-ray set on Amazon. I can't understand why &#34;Firefly&#34; was cancelled after only one season - the characters are great and each episode had something new and exciting going on. So sad that there aren't more episodes to watch!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Excellent! I saw the movie which was very good but so much was left out that I don't know how they decided which events to focus on. The background of the key characters is wonderful. This is a book I'm sure to read again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Like the rest of the series,it was a bit short but really good. I would read it again sometime :)
B004SDSSFY|3.0|When I first got my tablet, Documents To Go was the \\"must have\\" office productivity app out there. I almost spent $15 on it, but it came up as the Free App of the Day, so I got lucky and didn't have to pay for it. For me, it just doesn't live up to the hype. It works fine, but I found the interface to be a little clunky. I've tried all the office suite apps, and for me, this one is just mediocre. OfficeSuite Professional has a much nicer user interface that just made better sense to me. It was also easier to do simple things, like bold and italic words. Simple tasks like that were needlessly cumbersome in this app. In many ways, the app just gets in the way of trying to create my document. Glad I got it for free, because it would have been a waste of fifteen dollars.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a great buy for any Harry Potter fan. All 8 movies in one package, comes in a nice package and it makes it easier to keep your collection in one place.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|HUNGER GAMES is a quick read of futuristic fiction. It has love, suspense, gore, and thrill...all of which create the perfect storyline.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a close friend on one day and I finished reading the novel two days later. This is an easy read that everyone can relate to in some way.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Decided to give this game another chance, and I liked it better this time around.  The monster is cute, and it is fun to watch him munch on the candy.  Easy controls; just swype to cut the ropes and guide the candy into the monster's mouth.  Fun enough, but doubt I'll play all the levels.
143911000X|5.0|this is by far the most important peice of litriture for any bro anywhere on the planet...if you are a bro and u arent living by this then u are no bro of mine

B007XIC1GI|5.0|I read this book in its entirety in 2 days. I couldn't stop reading it. It's a book I could read over and over again!
B0090EJR1K|5.0|Almost died laughing.  Its hard to imagine anyone could be so naive and ignorant about real life as the character Sacha Baron Cohen plays.  Sad thing was, some of the ignorance and self absorption he portrayed isn't that off base compared to some the worlds real tyrants.  It was a great movie.
1439196834|4.0|i laughed and laughed and laughed......if u like barney then u will love this book and everything in it....legen...wait for it....dery
1439170916|5.0|But I ended up giving it to a medical student.<br />It was a little too much for me.<br />Excellent book.

B004GJDQT8|5.0|Got two new Samsung phones (Verizon) through Amazon. Rapid delivery and good prices. Activation was a bit confusing as I inadvertently set up two separate accounts rather than a family plan. That only cost an extra $100 before I got it corrected. Otherwise - no problems.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good vS evil style of romance. Nicholas Sparks never disappoints his readers with his novels. I read the book in two days over the Holiday break.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed watching Charlize Theron in this one. She always seems to get crazy parts in films. I definitely recommend this film!
B000VPPMXO|4.0|I have purchased two Roombas -- a 560 and a 650. The virtual walls/lighthouses are specific to the model that they were made for. If you purchase a lighthouse made for the 560, it will not work with (nor look like) the lighthouse for the 650. Perhaps the manufacturer's description makes it sound like they can work for different models -- but do not be fooled. Make sure you purchase for your specific model.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Gift for my grand daughter. She loved it. She loves all Barbie things. Enjoys the beach car. She also has the main house.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|YOu can only play so long before running out of cash bills and the game does not allow you to earn much without purchasing money with real money. Disappointing game
B009GESJH2|4.0|I was hoping this would be more similar to Rock and Roll Jesus, but it wasn't.  Not to say I don't like it; but I had to listen to it more times to end up liking it.  I'm hoping it will grow on me!
0307744434|2.0|Two children, each isolated by a teacher and taught only one subject.  I kept waiting for at least one of these two young people to go mad from the solitary confinement or grow-up warped from the cruelty but they both turned out fine. I don't want to spoil the final competition but I will say it wasn't worth all the suspense.  Throughout, we have page after page of descriptions of the very special circus which we are repeatedly told is magical but, with a few exceptions, sounds pretty much like every caramel smelling, trapeze flying circus I've ever seen.<br /><br />Seriously, is this all we want from fiction these days?  Florid descriptions of spooky-pretty stuff and characters who are interesting only because of their supernatural powers? I would worry that we aren't out-growing our fairy tale phase but even the best known fairy tale characters worked hard, were kind, brave and honest. Their goodness won out over the dark, supernatural forces of their evil foes. Now, it seems our heroes are the ones with the supernatural powers and their victory is unearned and rather boring to follow.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my father, who is a WWII buff.  He'd seen it on HBO when it originally aired, but he's excited to see it again.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|difficult to take photos with kindle held at an angle for lense of the camera to capture image and be seen by the photo taker. Could make the app more stable
B008G59IKO|5.0|If it's Green Day I'm bound to love it.  This cd did not disappoint me.  I hope the tour gets re-scheduled.
B000T433CO|2.0|Cute storyline but Cameron Diaz is totally miscast as the overly-serious, unemotional career type. The rest of the cast does really well.
B008CP92ZO|4.0|I really enjoyed this funny movie. I have watched it at least 4 times now and enjoyed it each and every time
B003G4W49C|4.0|If you are looking for a book that will grab your attention quickly and keep it then this is a book for you.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This resolved none of the questions posed by the last movie and just went in a new direction, poorly. How is that guy still alive, didn't he blow up last time? You are building towns underwater? Why? that seems terribly inefficient. The basketball player gets included in the elite tactical squad? In Russia? wait, why? There have to be better choices.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|TRUST ME PEOPLE THE FIRST 30 MINUTES WILL GET YOU SO HOOK AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Ordered this for my first Kindle Fire.  It fits perfectly and snugly, folds up in the back to prop it up if needed, and a nice elastic strip to hold closed if needed.  No problem accessing the plug-in for charging while in the case.  Durable.  Overall and exceptional product.
B006O3MU96|2.0|There are no instructions on how to play this game. I cannot play because I don't know what to do.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It provides a place to browse for files I've downloaded on my Kindle Fire.<br />This worked pretty well and creates icons for all of the items I want to open.<br />Definitely recommended!!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|WELL THIS ONE WILL BLOW YOU AWAY I SEEN THE FIRST ONE AND I HAD TO GET MORE OF THIS GODLIKE THAT THIS ANIME IS.AND IT'S AWESOME...BOOMM
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Anyone giving this a good review is smoking dope.  We didn't even finish the movie. Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|cannot stop listening to this, you cant just go to the movies and not want to relive the music. anne hathaway blows my mind everytime
B00338QENI|4.0|Within this one book one watches the fibers of racial, economic, and educational divides twist into a yarn that is strong and beautiful in its final form.  The fast evolution of medical morality, the chasm that was (is?) often not even recognized between the educated and uneducated, the devastation that superstition can bring, and the journey across the divides most Americans never try are all presented in their raw honesty.<br /><br />The loss of a mother and the following terrors of abuse, the trappings of poverty all are the lenses through which the Lacks children must focus as they try to understand how their mother's cells are being used without their knowledge or permission.  The fortunes made from Henrietta stands in stark contrast to the financial despair of her children.  Skloot shares Henrietta's story, her children as they learn and try to understand, and her own journey through cultural divides as she tries to overcome the decades-long well-earned distrusts.<br /><br />Artfully written and meaningful as both a human interest and scientific ethical exam, Skloot does all sides justice: the Lacks family, the medical profession, and the reader
B004IWF64Q|5.0|Considering it's a direct-to-video release it's very well done<br />with good songs and nice production value.<br /><br />Some have said it's not quite as good as good as the first movie,<br />but the first one was a theatrical release so it's like comparing apples to oranges.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|this is a very nice family movie, this is one of our favorites, this type of movie is for the enjoyment of an entire family young to old
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I try to listen to 103.5 Kost, but It doesn't tune to the right station! It's a waste. No wonder it is free download from amazon.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|They say humor often comes from pain and while Tina Fey gives the reader some glimpses of the root of some of her comedy - the insecurities and pain of youth - she neither delves into it wholly nor provides the incredible humor she shows in performances.  Sadly, it was a book I looked forward to with eagerness that did not meet its potential.
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|I luv the book but just like the third wheel it is based on one thing mostly but the other previous books were based on multiple things
B00A757EFW|3.0|I have not really taken the time to figure it out right now.  My granddaughters decided I needed this on my kindle.
B009738XXM|4.0|Great songs to dance to! Recommended for anyone who loves to boogie. Great price. Like to see more albums on sale like this one
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I was blown away Christmas morning with seeing this movie. Such an incredible cast! Anne Hathaway stole the movie for me. Granted she isn't in it that much, but her protrayal of the character Fantine, was filled with heart and emotion. I can't wait to see it again and again. Cameron Mackintosh, AWESOME job! And I pray next up will be the movie version of MISS SAIGON!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|It was good. At times it was hard to understand. I would have to go back and see some parts over to get what they ment.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|My first swivel sweeper (which was black in color) was just great but this one (red) is terrible...will not hold a charge and the handle is very loose and acts like it will break.....I do not use it anymore, I went and bought a Bissell Perfect Sweep Turbo.  I was always a firm believer in the Swivel Sweeper...bought about a total of 5 of the black ones, one for me and each Grandchild got one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Entertaining light book.  Just fun easy reading. Relaxing but holds attention.  A wonderful lay in the bath tub type read

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Makes it really easy to log onto FB. I love Facebook and would truly recommend this application for loggin on from Kindle.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I gave it as a gift. Didn't watch it. I was not to happy with the part I saw with there bottoms showing.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The music is upbeat and refreshing.  It is fun to listen to, and others who have heard it like it as well.
B007MDB6L0|3.0|Maybe I need to watch it again...<br />Santa just brought this long-awaited new Tinkerbell installment the other day, and we finally had the first viewing this afternoon.<br />It's got some great aspects: we all loved learning that Tinkerbell has a sister, and getting a chance to see more of the Winter Land was very cool.<br />But it seemed to lack something the others didn't - a solid storyline.  We (4 yr. old and 7 yr. old savvy girls) kept waiting to get into it, then suddenly without warning it was over.  Huh?  That was it??<br />Like I said, maybe we have to watch it again, but there's something to be said about first impressions.<br />I was very surprised to see how many people gave it the max amount of stars.  Maybe they were targeted previewers hand-picked by Disney??<br />All in all it was not an unenjoyable movie  - but I feel like it was definitely lacking in basic story structure, depth and detail.  Plus, it was SO short.  It felt incomplete.  If you compare it with the last Tinkerbell movie, these are two productions on opposite ends of the spectrum.  The Great Fairy Rescue was longer, richer, and followed a basic story structure (Dramatic Arc?) with a solid beginning (rising action), climax, resolution (falling action), ending (denouement) .  This latest has almost none of that.  Kind of a shame after their three other fantastic movies for children that are so refreshingly free of needless violence.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I liked this book because it addresses the larger issues in business that are often ignored. I have recommended it to two others already.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Really great pack for the price. I carry all my filters, 3 lenses, cleaning kit and camera. Well, built this one's an amazon winner
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Not one dull moment.  Movie was exciting and engaging.  Made a perfect movie night with family and friends.  Love the Hulk!!!
B008N1V11U|5.0|Well I love anything that has to do with Batman, so I had no hesitation buying this app when I saw it... After all it's only 99 cents! Best. Money. Spent. Ever!!!! This app is AMAZING! The graphics, missions, and just everything are great! It's very similar to the games on Xbox and the Ps3... Well worth buying!!!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Adobe Reader quickly disappointed. This had good reviews so I tried it.<br /><br />Pages render quickly and pre-renders the next page. Good. It is not as quick to render as the native viewer on the Kindle Fire HD. If swiping too quickly it will pause for several seconds to catch up. I don't like that but still far better than the adobe app. I use large docs (text books) and I like this program.<br /><br />The interface takes a little figuring out. Access to some of the more important features like goto page are not so obvious. I also nest bookmarks and it requires a touch/hold to access a context menu to hit an upper level book mark.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Forget everything you've heard about these books and judge for yourself.<br /><br />If you like romance and strong female characters then you will like this book.<br /><br />Also if you liked the twlight series you will either love this or hate it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a very satisfying exciting end to the trilogy.  Mocking Jay actually left me content with the ending.  Some trilogies end with more questions than answers but this covered everything I required.  Excellent series.
B004H4XLRE|5.0|My son has autism and he has stepped on dropped done it all to this toy.  It still keeps working no problem, very durable, super happy with this toy!
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I needed something more robust than the PDF viewer on the Kindle Fire HD. The native software rendered instantly but gave no options to goto page, view bookmarks or to note or highlight. I have work with large docs (500-1000 pg)<br /><br />Adobe Reader made sense to be the first choice but was very weak. Each page turn took several seconds to render. If that wasn't the page I wanted then several seconds on the next page. It was very cumbersome. It was also difficult to discover how to import docs despite the 10 page users guide that opens to start. I believe adobe needs to make a light version for not so powerful devices.
B00818J504|2.0|I was very let down by this book. I'm not a Ke$ha fanatic but I was curious about her and really thought this book would give me an in-depth look at her but it only scratched the surface. I was really hoping she'd elaborate on how she was the worst waitress in L.A. but she didn't :( really wanted a story. This is an overview of her & it gives a general understanding of her but if you're looking for something with substance this isn't the book for you.
B007MDB548|5.0|My kids ages 7 and 3 (twins) loved this movie.  They laughed and shouted with delight.  Love the combo with blu-ray for the house and the dvd for the van.  We love all the Tinker Bell movies which emphasize friendship and working together.
1452110581|5.0|A good book to recline back and enjoy the pictures and poems and have a good laugh when you've had a hard day!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I bought this for my kids this holiday season. They really enjoyed watching it. We had other kids over ranging in ages from 4 to 9 and they all enjoyed it as well. This is a fun holiday movie that the whole family will enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am so in love with Holder in this book. And Sky. They share a connection that most people will never experience in their entire lives. All I can say is \\"Incredible!!!!\\" This story is amazing!!!!<br /><br />Warning: prepare for dark circles under your eyes and break out the concealer. You're going to need it because once you start reading, you won't put this book down. Forget about sleeping until you finish this amazing journey...
B009KHDT0C|5.0|FUN!!!  the cast was great and Mr. Burton is awesome as always.  Simple name, complex character; Eva Green!  Well Done!
0316236535|4.0|I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old nephew. The story is simple--the monster appears and then disappears one body part at a time as you turn the pages. The accompanying text is cute and repetitive, which is perfect for beginning readers. Plus, it also has color labels for the body parts which makes it a color primer of sorts.
B00003CXAA|5.0|It was an offer I couldn't refuse.  Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.  It's not personal, it's business. Leave the gun, take the cannoli.
B004BRP7R4|5.0|I am never, ever, disappointed with Josh's music!  His wonderful talent always touches me and makes my heart so happy!  I am looking forward to the release of his new cd - I know it will be great!
0525952926|5.0|Follett's excellent.  I've read all of his books (almost) and aside from needless sexual descriptions, is a very engaging writer.  One of my favorites!
B009MF5BXK|3.0|I gave it only a three star rateing because I felt parts fo the movie were too grafficly violent. Would not recomend for younger audience.
2090338482|3.0|Although this is a good basic grammar, I would have liked it more with additional examples.  It is also a rip-off that you have to purchase an additional book for exercises with an answer key.  Why not just sell a bigger book?
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|A great film that deals with the day to day aspects of marriage and how we relate to one another,
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I suggest you read the above critical reviews of this book -- you have just turned me against Kindle and Amazon -- you can go<br />to your collective hells.
0307341577|4.0|This was a new author for me and a rather different story line. Now I can't wait to read her other two books
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Yet another great book I just wish she would release more than one a year . Can't wait for the  next one
B0015DROBO|3.0|I'm sorry,but I just don't see what all the fuss is about.I have no interest in reading the rest of the trilogy.
B004TI5N38|5.0|great book and I don't know what elese to say to meet your rquirement of so many words -- this is another reason<br />I'm getting rid of my kindle fire --
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Appears to be low quality but at this low price serves the purpose to protect the Kindle.  My 7 and 12 year-old sons will beat on them anyway.  They already have personalized stickers and writing on the covers.  So all in all a decent purchase.  I didn't want to spend 30-50 bucks on a fancy leather one.
B0086700CM|5.0|If you have nothing to do and you want to be playing something fun, this is the job for temple run! When you die its tempting to let this out of sight.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good, simple, addictive &amp; challenging. Great for those times that you need something to occupy your mind but you can't be completely immersed...like winding down for the evening, waiting for an appointment, have five minutes to yourself. Easy to walk away from but fun when you need  it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I resent thefact  I have to say eight teen words or more I am not a book critic but you have just made it<br />possible to cancel anything to dpo wtih Amazon -- What part of great Book is not enough
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I don't get this game. The goal is unclear, there are no instructions, and the store doesn't have a description at all. From what I can figure out it isn't very fun. This is a sure waste of time and money.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I love this movie, it reminds me of Christmas' past.  There was a greater sense of community then . People really cared about each other .... this is why I love this movie!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Great writings done by a very intelligent soul! My rating is a 4 and I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Brings back memories of the old game.<br />I like it, but it's a little hard to control the &#34;little guu&#34;; it will take some getting used to.  But still like it
B0076DELIG|4.0|Nice read. Great action -- though it did require  keeping track of many moving parts. Suspenseful all the way  to the end.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|If this book were required reading before marriage, perhaps the divorce rate would drop. Common sense isn't always common. Excellent book.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I wasn't sure if I should go see this movie because lately comdey movies have not been funny at all but was surprised that this movie was actually funny. Made me laugh my brains out.<br /><br />Plot<br />In high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was a dork and Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the popular jock. After graduation, both of them joined the police force and ended up as partners riding bicycles in the city park. Since they are young and look like high school students, they are assigned to an undercover unit to infiltrate a drug ring that is supplying high school students synthetic drugs.<br /><br />In 2005, Schmidt and Jenko are high school students, one an honor roll geek, the other a cool, athletic underachiever. By 2012, they are rookie cops, paired together, on bike patrol yearning to make arrests. After a screw up, they're sent undercover back to high school to find the source of a dangerous synthetic drug. They mix up their names, and Schmidt gets the no-brainer classes where he auditions for Peter Pan and falls in love with Wendy; Jenko gets AP classes where he falls in with high-achieving dweebs. This second chance at high school gives Schmidt delusions of grandeur, which threaten the operation.
0307719774|5.0|I love it so much that I bought it for several people this year. I've had it since last year so I can start comparing my entries this January.
B007HO392S|5.0|I like her music so it was no surprise that I like this album. I've only listened to it a few times from beginning to end but I think I liked her previous album better.
0446554995|5.0|It has been just over a year since I last read the preceding novel, [[ASIN:0446554979 Cold Vengeance]], and after finishing this Christmas present altogether too quickly, I am contemplating re-reading the series in its entirety so the wait won't feel as long for the thirteenth book! The book opens up with a bit of refresher in the last climatic moments of the eleventh book. Actually, the authors do a wonderful job of summarizing the key points to help remind readers of the previous actions Each of the three cliffhangers are wrapped up rather quickly - and with some truly shocking action along the way! It's remarkably easy to once again be swept up into the intriguing world of Pendergast and his assorted friends (and enemies) as the previous books build to a fascinating and exciting conclusion.<br /><br />And though I absolutely loved it, I will admit that there are a few times when the authors bring this book into an almost soap-opera-like plot level. This new territory for the series works remarkably well, though, and certainly opens up new avenues for future volumes. The two minor lines of the plot - Constance's and Corrie's do reach a conclusion as well here, but each story stays surprisingly separate, which is perhaps my only complaint. Previous novels have really woven in the most extraneous of plot points, and these disparate lines - though exciting - never fully fit in with where I expected them to go based on the two previous installments.<br /><br />Despite its near approach to five hundred pages, this is a fast-paced book and quickly becomes difficult to put down. This writing duo makes a formidable team, that's for sure! It definitely is a more satisfying and less frustrating read than the last two cliffhanger-ridden entrants to the series, but this one still manages to leave you desperate to see just where Pendergast will go next in his thirteenth adventure. I hope the wait isn't a long one!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved this and the entire set.. very good read. definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an addicting but good read..
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Unexciting game and much too slow to play!  It is like the real game in an arcade: boooring. I got it by error not by choice.
B008DKBR6U|4.0|Bought this for my dad.  He is not particular and had no preference so I was trying to buy something that I thought he would be able to work with but still protect his kindle.
B004DTLK62|2.0|I just had to own this in Blue-Ray.  I think it is the best movie ever and the best part Robert Downey Jr. has ever done.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much...I couldn't be more happy than I am right now.  Keep up the good job that all of you are doing.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This is an excellent movie for kids.....and adults!! Would recommend for family night with popcorn!! My son really enjoyed the movie, now onto the next movie.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|great cd. definitely an Adele fan. even my kids love her music. the go-to cd in the care all the time.
B000FCKBCU|3.0|I dont normally read these type of books.  A friend recommended it to me. It was a fun book to read compared to my more intense books. It was completely unrealistic but still entertaining.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|That was great and fast that the CD got here.  It just amazes me how efficient all of you are.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son enjoyed this movie, this would be a great family night movie choice!! Get yours today and enjoy with the kiddos!!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The thing we noticed about this version of &#34;Les Mis&#34; is the intense and powerful emotion<br />portrayed in the music.  It is compelling, humbling, and captivating.  I love it!

B005LAIHSG|3.0|Thanks for the great service....It is nice to see people who work very hard to get the job done...Kudos to all.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I thought this case was very easy to handle.  It is lightweight and easy to use either upright or sideways.  It is compact, so is easy to carry in my purse.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who wants a case that is very portable and easy to handle for reading in bed, also.<br /><br />Mrs. Morean Netterville
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I enjoy this alarm clock.  the blue background is perfect for bedtime.  I use this app the full time.  it rocks!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I Loved the music! The movie had some very funny one liners and standout moments and performances that really made this fun. On the down side, The toilet humor went a bit too far for me. Overall it was totally worth renting but I would pass on owning and just go straight for the sound track because the music really was great.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I thought it would take longer to arrive but it did not.  Fabulous job.  Keep up with the great job you guys are doing
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down once I gave it a chance.  I almost returned the book because it's about 2 high school kids.  I wish that would have been in the small description of what the book is about.  I read all the 4 and 5 star reviews and gave it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  These two characters are different in that one suffered abuse and the other a tragic loss.  But they aren't too different that I can remember what it was like as a kid growing up in high school.  Kids in abusive situations or who suffer a tragic loss tend to be more mature and grow up years sooner than their actual age.  That was the case here with Holden and Sky.  There was only one loose end I wish would have been tied up for me, but it's not a deal breaker in recommending this book.  Do take head though in the recommended reading age.  The subject matter is a very serious one.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie is awesome.  Clint Eastwood is still the man after all these years.  Doesn't hurt that hottie Amy Adams is in the movie.  Great movie, the whole family enjoyed it.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Helps to down load read only files. I allows the Kindle Fire to operate more like an I Pad when on-line or browsing through emails
B003Y5H54W|3.0|The CD got here quick...The movie was kinda strange...but all in all it was great that the product got here fast.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I liked the product that I choose.  I loved Downton Abbey seasons one and two and can hardly wait for season three.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Got this movie for my husband, he enjoys action pack movie.  He really did like it, better than part one.
B0034G4P94|5.0|great product and great transaction
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book came to me when I needed it most.... very thankful f or this read and for the author.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book took me through a whole range of emotions. I appreciate this book for the topics it touched and how emotionally charged it was for each character and how I feel I could find some semblance of a connection through each character. Great Book truly one of my fave writers.
B002N1AF8G|5.0|Having certain kind of music in my collections. This recording was a Gem to have. Always was a Tour De France fan for a long time and Its wonderful to have this priceless recording in the collection. Thanks Again Amazon for making this addition to my collection possible.  CMPack.
B006ZEEHQS|5.0|Johnny Depp is a favorite actor of mine, and he does very well in this one, too. He'll make you laugh and keep you interested. It is sometimes hard to follow the story, but I never get bored of watching it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book suck butt this is the worst book I have ever read .further more this book should not go . On shelve because of the lack of b'm definnese
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Used it as extended memory for HP printer. Great substitution for OEM memory that cost couple hundred $$$. Buy this one and looks no further.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|so far it works very well with some of the documents I have used I will give it a more difficult time on some other projects I have coming out soon.<br />Thanks Karl
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Great cult classic! Seen this movie too many times to count and it still makes me laugh. You got red on you.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Really enjoy watching this Star Trek.  Have seen it not only in the movie theater but several times at home.<br />Looking forward to the new Star Trek that comes out next year.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book keeps your interest through the whole book a real page turner one of the best I've read
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|the style and the art of the books you can customize are nice but I will need more time with the app to give it a full review
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Excellent and believable effects with total action.  Reminded us of the Bourne action thrillers.  We had to laugh though at how throughout the entire movie the characters never stop for injury, food, water, rest, anything.  Makes one grateful at the end that our lives don't ever really play out like that.  Whew!
B004XDYJRU|3.0|The app generally works very well, but it (and to be fair almost every other Internet radio app I have tried) will not connect to WUMB-FM which is my favorite station. Funny, because their desktop app does work for this station.
B008EKON56|4.0|This is an inexpensive fix for getting good stereo sound back on an iPod with a wonky headphone connection. One thing that was surprising is that the volume control on the iPod does not work with this device - fortunately, the volume is amplified to a good level.
B0041VXGRS|5.0|It has been a fun reference book and some cute creations have been made using these ideas as inspiration.  I have enjoyed using and sharing the book.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|MIB is always a good time, and seeing a twist in this one of going back in time was super!  I won't say more, just a fun one to watch.  Enjoy!
B0042X9L6A|4.0|Overall the control layout is superior to the SB-600.  The only drawback is that at 50mm the light output is slightly less than the SB-600 and it is bulkier to boot.  Like the SB-600 head does not lock on the vertical position.
0316010669|5.0|Excellent, one of the very few books that I have reread.  Reminds me of a recent statement that: &#34;our consious mind is like a stowaway on a super tanker that thinks he is in comand&#34;.  The subconsious mind is shown in action in this book.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I send it as a gift to my son who could have Christmas without it. He enjoyed all the memories of home, ha ha ha
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Very well done movie in characters, acting, effects.  I normally don't like vampire or zombie movies but this one pulled it off.  Was wondering why they chose Abraham Lincoln, but is a great way to make him cool all over again!  If you want to see some super axe swing'n moves and be reminded the words of our founding fathers, it's all there.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|we got an edge game once before as FAOTD, but i deleted that one quickly because i couldn't get through a single level. this one is better, i think maybe it's the controls. i haven't tried &quot;tilt&quot; because i think it might be impossible, but so far i find i can control the block best using arrows. still, you have to be careful to press the arrows for just the right amount of time. in any case, i've gotten through about 7 levels so far, which is a huge improvement even though i get a &quot;D&quot; on every level! i wish you could scroll around the field to see where everything is though. i'd give this game 5 stars if it let you do that. but everything else about this game is great - the graphics, the gameplay, the music, and the challenges. i think it will have tremendous replay value. thanks amazon!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Worked fine for me. I used the same charging base I use from my iPhone so it saves some room on the outlets while charging the Kindle without any problems
B000FC0P9E|5.0|I thought Bigfoot was following her the whole time. But it was more spiritual journey. Hope that I never have to go through this.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|My son loves the oceans movie and lion movie so this was a natural choice for us. Out of the three I like this one the best because of Tim Allen, he does a great job!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Great album.  This is a great first ablum with many good tracks.  We'll be seeing more from Phillip Phillips - he has a mellow rock sound.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I really love this cover. It's light weight and it works great when I need to rest the Kindle on a table/counter. Recommend it.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book but I was not excited by it. It's terrific writing of course, it's Grisham, but it's so restrained and although I was hooked in the first few pages to discover what Bannister was up to, I felt a bit  like Bannister in a way. Unmoved. He's ultra cool, patient, methodical and unflappable.... and because he's a main character I never felt he was threatened and therefore I didn't feel concerned for him. He always had a fall back plan which, if I understood correctly, was &#34;oh well, I'll just stay here then&#34;.<br />Janice
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Product is a piece of junk!  It is too small for the kindle.  It looks and feeels CHEAP!!!!!<br /><br />CAVETAT EMPTOR.  BUYER BEWARE! !!!
0811879542|5.0|This is a great interactive book, my son just loves it! His favourite part is shaking the book to see what happens to the dots on the next page.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game!  It's all the fun of the other Angry  Birds games with a Sci-Fi twist. You gotta try this.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Saw it in 3d at the theater and then again at IMAX.  Was thrilled to see the price come down on the new release.  If you have a 3D TV and BluRay this is a must have for your collection.
1250027624|4.0|This book further develops the characters in this rich PBS series.  Insights from the actors that play each character are included.
B00514HDNW|1.0|Ending sucks so boo on you and the book though what dream as may come was absolutely awesome so yeah
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Good read, somewhat dark at times but well written. If you like Steven Erickson you'll like Anthony Ryan. Excellent, fun.
030758836X|1.0|The plot is driven by the character development and endless detail.  Unfortunately the characters are neither likable or believable. The ending adds to the disbelief and it is a relief that the inevitable finally happens and the torture is over.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Boring.  Not funny at all.  Thought it would be good with these actors.  It wasn't.  Do not bother or waste your time.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson's only good work before he took the big nose dive that destroyed his family. This... the greatest story ever told of Christ suffering, is the most powerful message I have ever known.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Fantastic alarm clock. All features work great. No issue with KF not sleeping. I'm hard to wake and it got me up every day. As a free app, it's a must-have alarm clock.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Nice under dog love story... a little G rated though... absolutely loved Travis!  I recommend this book to anyone in the mood for feisty love... lol
B000I9WWCM|5.0|For my wife and I, this was such a great and enjoyable movie to watch together. Great actors and the setting being in London was what made it so authentic and personal.<br />Good movie to watch...<br />Thank you...
B00942S4OY|5.0|Another dvd to add to the kids collections, these little girls are obsessed with this british boy band, I suppose to be young again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't know what to say other than perfect. I never write these things but with this book It is like I must. This is one book that has everything. Please if your on the fence just take chance and read it. I did and it was so worth it.
B003I55BIA|5.0|So I was suspecting a super sad and clich&eacute; ending to this book but there was none! I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a cute opposites attract love story.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|THIS JUST HAD TO BE SEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN. GUESS I NEED A BIGGER T.V. CAUSE THE IMPACT FEEL WAS MISSING.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is a short season, but well worth the money!  Even if you are not truly into zombies, but character based shows then you should consider watching this show.  The characters are well developed and exciting to watch them react to these new life scenarios.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It pales in comparison to the original \\"Bourne\\" movies. It was just okay. Good actors/actress but not so good storyline.
B00009YXHN|5.0|If you like old school horror effects...Damn that Digital C#$P!!!...This Title is for you....Who needs one's and zero's when you've got real old school effects...
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|This was a great movie.  Download was good with no issues.  Will use service again. . . . . .
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is so intricately quirky and I mean it in the nicest way possible, I never expected a movie about cooking food could be funny, thoughtful, and unexpected. The message is clear the truth always wins and even though my daughter is too young to understand it, it's great to know that movies have lessons that we can all learn from. Every time I put this movie in my daughter immediately stops what she is doing and watches and at the end she claps and says &#34;Yay.&#34;  I never grow tired of this movie it is great:)
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I loved this movie, it was good they kept so many historical things about Lincoln and just added a twist. Interesting movie, very easy to follow, good all around.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another excellent book by Tom Clancy . I hope he keeps the Ryan story line going. It kept me fully excited
B0038P59A0|5.0|One of my favorite books and Robert Downey Jr. Does a great portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. Recommend you try this movie.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|They should make it clear fom the beginning that after you install that \\"free\\" app you can ONLY connect to a machine on the same subnet.  If it is not, e.g. you are acessing it over the Internet, they make you BUY an addon pack or something. Shady sneaky sales practice.<br />Why not to use Logmein instead then?
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Yea!..I love this feature. For only 1.99 I could view a movie that costs so much more to purchase, watch once and never use again.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Love this album. Radioactive is definitely my fav song but all together imagine dragons did a wonderful job putting this album together :-)
B005HSL626|5.0|I LIKE IT  AND I WOULD SUGGEST IT FOR LITTLE PEOPLE PEOPLE SO I THINK U SHOULD BUY IT TOTALY!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The ending is horrid...the book itself was interesting but why did it have to end so badly? If it would have ended differently I might have read the next in the trilogy.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|This Lego box is average in size, be sure to look at the description for measurements. It comes in a nice Lego Star Wars box. It was easy to zip together the first time. It is more of a holder not a carrying box, as the lid does not close tightly. My five year old son thinks it's so cool!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was good, predictable, but a very cute story. Really enjoyed it, it was a very easy read, finished in a day.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|. . .that is elementary and junior high.  It's a horror fan's dream come true, just see it when the kids go to sleep.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Well...I enjoyed the book. Sad some of my favourite characters appear to be no more. Of course I will get the next book. Must find out what happens to Cersei and her twin. And what is going on with the others? This author keeps you turning the pages...that is for sure!
1423140605|5.0|This book was a gift for my Grandson, he was estatic that he got it along with his Christmas gifts.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|MC4 was an ok games overall.  I was hoping for much better weapons and was kind of sad about that.  After MC3 this game was a let down.  The support characters look and sound different than past games.  What I do like is weapon equality in multiplayer.  A first time. player actually has a chance in this one unlike past games.  I was expecting the same huge improvement that was given in MC3.  I thought it was a subpar game compared to it.  Though I am dissapointed by the story and characters I think Page was portrayed very well.  I hope MC5 will have the same improvement seen in MC3.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|excellent book... hard to put down. I found that this book was hard to turn away from like Christopher Grey in the book.  You keep coming back for more.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a good game. better than usual with tasks and extras.  would like to see more of a plot
B009E3EY38|5.0|Sound Quality was great. Loved the 5.1 video. Maybee this is a prealude to a 2 city  tour? Saw Led zeppelin in 1977 in Detroit live. I think i am a diehard with wishfull thinking. Song Remains the same,How the west was won and Celebration day help keep my hopes alive. Put the cd in my player when i received my preorder and haven't taken it out yet.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Wonderful source of information and news.  I use it every day to find out what important events are happening in the world...
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game is so awesome very addictive!!!<br />I use a stylus while playing giving me optimum control but, game is good with just finger. enjoy playing again very addictive!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|One of my favorite games!  Never gets borring. Now you can play both sides! Awesome! Five more words to submit!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a very fun game. Kind of easy for my 11 year old and more levels are needed. but a fun game none the less.
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed the story line .......I fine everyone is making too much of a big deal about the sex ...............it was interesting enough, but what I enjoyed the most was the relationship and the fact that it was not so out there as some people may believe.  A TRUE MISMATCH
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book is nothing but abusive and has nothing to with the lifestyle at all, it is pricks like Christian grey that give dominants a bad name and characters like Anna that  make women feel this sort of behavior is normal or healthy both in and out of the lifestyle
B00170DEM8|5.0|We really love this movie. Wouldn't be Christmas without watching this during the Christmas holiday. Love the remastered DVD version.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It was easy to download and install and makes downloading books for amazon super easy.  It is easy to use and easy to read.
0316228532|5.0|The book was in new condition and arrived on time. It was just as we expected it to be, and made a great Christmas gift. Thank you.
0345803507|5.0|Very interesting books. After I saw it on the NY Times book list for a year, I decided to buy the set, and read them. Frnkly, You need an open mind, as the sexual descriptions are very vivid.
B009ETEEAU|4.0|This unit weighs very little. Even with the protective case and mount, it doesn't tip the scales much. It is also a very inexpensive unit. It feels like a spy camera, it's so small. At 5mp, it is low but completely fine for creating shots for the Internet.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good storyline that draws you in wanting more!<br />Wish it was a little longer though, can't wait to read more by her.
0060574216|5.0|I had heard so much about this book and how fantastic it was and so helpful.  The shipper was great and the book is in really good shape, as he stated.....will use this shipper again.....
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this to be the best and most informative book on nde's I have ever read. Very descriptive and clear.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I bought this to read to my elderly mother-in-law but am not sure which of us enjoyed it the most.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|The previews were a lot funnier than the movie itself. Cute movie, but not as much of a comedy as I expected. Good though.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This app's major downfall is that players have to spend months saving up gems or purchasing them with real money. Neither option is really great for kids who have little money or patience. The plot is enjoyable. I personally don't like the social aspect of the game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|5 stars! Well written. Authentic. Far more than an accounting  of the killing of Bin Laden.  This is the first 'real boots on the ground' account of war in Afganistan and Iraq I've read; I gained a new appreciatation for all the men and women protecting our freedom.  Thank  you for sharing your story.
034580404X|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey isnt a literary masterpiece. However, its an entertaining, twisted love story. It's so addictive, you'll find yourself losing sleep just to read the next chapter, because you become so wrapped up in the story.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Since my wife and I both love seeing animated movies together, and since we both enjoy video games (especially me), it was decided that we absolutely had to see this movie!  We had received a Regal Gift card a while before this came out and we actually hoarded what was on it to see this and The Hobbit once it came out as well.<br /><br />Going into this movie we figured we'd enjoy it because we already had some people we knew say it was awesome, and we certainly did love it, from start to finish!  It was very well done and very well voiced!  Plus, of course, like most animated movies, it had a good moral at the end.<br /><br />My favorite part, as was many people's favorite part I'm sure, was the meeting with all the various video game villains...that part was cool.  It was neat seeing all of those actual video game villains in that part, as well as all the others at different points throughout the movie.  All around, the movie was great fun and suitable for most any age.  I highly recommend this one!  I for one will be picking this up upon it's release...definitely collection worthy!
B002APU580|5.0|Absolutely wonderful, and very romantic.  This is Jane Austen at her best.  Matthew MacFadyen is fabulous, I am checking out his other movies.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|About 2/3 of the way thru, the streaming became very slow and it would stop and back up every few minutes......very frustrating!
1582406723|5.0|My son said they were in great shape.  He enjoyed reading this series very much and cant wait til 18 comes out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before I read this but am so glad I took the time.  The book really lets you know the feelings and thoughts the movie assumes you will understand.  Love Katniss caught between feelings of love for both Peeta and Gale!
B000UJ48UO|5.0|have been waiting for blu-ray for long time in widescreen...looks great...great price!! could not find in stores...have been looking for long time.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Yes I like this game. It wasn't scatter though... until I had 7 notes and I got grapes in the creepy house with the wary Tv. Then I had to crape my pants.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|My spouse like it and wanted me to order it. It was a gift for him. Thanks. Will order again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds Free is fun and very addictive.  I love the sound effects and the variety of Angry Birds scenarios.
0061854549|5.0|Even though others got to the great term &#34;freakonomics&#34; first, I found Dan the preferred author about the psychological aspects of economics.  &#34;Predictably Irrational&#34; is well reasoned and reads easily.  I recommend this and any other books he might write.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|You can't live without Adobe Reader these days, even on your smart phone. This program lets you read .pdfs on the go.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Could not be happier with this set - have not encountered any of the difficulties enumerated in the 1 and 2  star reviews.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I got this game as a free App of the Day. I started playing it and I LOVE it! There are many levels, many &#34;worlds&#34;, and it super entertaining.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would recommend this app/game!
B003L77GGK|5.0|got these for my son for a gift cuz he is a true fan of the series and he loved it! great price and fast shipping!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Strong cast and great script! Gets better each season. Guest stars are also exceptional. Amazon makes it easy to keep up since I miss it every week on CBS.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Looks/feels a lot like Alien but it's different enough and keeps you guessing enough to be pretty entertaining. Honestly, I'm still a little confused about what the big &#34;answer&#34; was. I guess I'll need to watch it again..  Of course, great effects and imaginative sets/costumes/other 'stuff' that I won't spoil.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was completely captivated the moment I started reading, Suzanne Collins writes beautifully! I can't wait to start on Mockingjay !
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I downloaded this book to get control over a few small habits an really at first couldn't understand why I was reading all these stories about others with much more serious habits to overcome, companies with larger issues, etc. But as it turns out the author  is a bit smarter than I! :-)  Remembering the stories helps to make the last chapter stick! Great read and I hope with some serious planning on my part will help me to conquer my own bad habits!
B00000IZOR|5.0|it is a very strong product the only problem is that the babys never have seen this kind of telephon in their life
1844137872|5.0|I've always liked Bansky and this is a great piece of inspiration for my Graffiti. Thanks so much I love it
B005K2YRVG|4.0|This case does an excellent job of protecting our Kindle.  The case has sufficient padding and fits perfectly with the device.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Fast easy read  to understand and keep up on characters.  Enjoyed characters and how Mitch Albom ties everyone together at the end.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|&#34;The Art of Racing in the Rain&#34;,  is good reading for animal lovers. I laughed and cried and wanted to go get me another dog.
B004HAEGP4|4.0|I don't usually enjoy these types of movies but eh,  its a good movie to watch with my son.  He LOVES resident evil movies and video games.  My son and I have one more resident evil to watch and we'll be caught up.<br /><br />It's not a waste of time,  the graphic effects are good and the fighting scenes are far fetched but then again so is the whole movie lol,  all in all it was quite enjoyable.
B0016OM3TU|5.0|The picture quality was excellent, the sound was fabulous, and the story line was very entertaining. Round Midnight is the perfect movie for jazz lovers.
1402545355|5.0|Really enjoyed the audio. The reader breathes life into the characters. I purchased both the books and the audio of the series and treasure them all. At times while reading,I could hear the characters in the same voices in which they were portrayed in the audio.
B00701QV8W|5.0|This album is \\"the music score\\" of the era.<br /><br />Classic rock at its finest.<br /><br />Grace Slick, Marty Ballin, Paul Kantner, Jack Cassidy, and Jorma K. What a sound.<br /><br />These guys were really good!
034580404X|1.0|I got this for a gift for Christmas and now I can't get a full fund because it was too late. Now they don't even have the 1st book to start reading... NOT HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!!!!!
1475143389|5.0|I have been lifting for the betterment of 10 years, through high school, college, and military. I was prey to the flashy muscle mags (not that there is anything wrong with them, they tell you what they want you to know), I have had good results through the years. Mostly the gains were small and exhausting. After 2.5 weeks on the workout here, I can tell a difference. It's not a fad/flashy workout or diet plan, it just makes sense.<br /><br />I was able to fit the 60 min workout in my day, even working 12 hours a day. At the age of 30, I am still progressing. This is not a &#34;quick&#34; get big/lean plan, this takes dedication and time. It will work, you just have to put in the time and effort.<br /><br />About the book:<br /><br />It is an easy read, with the first couple of chapters outlining terms and misconceptions. Take the time to read the definitions and terms, it really helps with understanding your body. The workout plan is a no-nonsense plan, if followed will without a doubt work.<br /><br />There is a surprise towards the end of the book, so read it all the way through.<br /><br />About the author:<br /><br />I took advantage of the surprise at the end of the book. I was greeted by the author and he cleared up an questions I had about my w/o plan and diet.  The response time was a day or so (during the holidays).<br /><br />I am not a big review writer, but when some things worth it, I will take the time.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I downloaded this game because I loved Rayman on the first PS but now every time I try to load the game I get a message that says \\"something needs to be downloaded to play.\\" So I let my kindle try to download whatever it is and it restarts. Then when I try to open it again. I get the same message. Totally waste of money.
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVE this series even better the second time around! I highly recommend it. The pacing is spot on exciting from start to finish.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was definitely a good read, considering that once I picked up the book, I couldn't leave my Kindle. Suzanne Collins knows  how to entrap her readers like the fate of the tributes from District 12. All I haven't to say is that if you don't read this book, you haven't come into the world of adventure yet.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker:  I really enjoyed this series it was quick and fun to read.  Something different than I usually read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest game ever!!! the only complaint I have is that u have to have wifi to get ur daily challange but other than that I totally recommend this app for Everyone.  get this app now
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Keeps me in touch with my friends all over the country. It is a good way to see what is goig on.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|boardwalk and game of thrones best hbo shows ever.mini series can be difficult, but the writing and characters on these shows are great.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really love Mahjong but this version is REALLY fun because it adds a cute treasure hunt type challenge.  I'm also a comic book fan so the artwork really entertains.
1449415881|5.0|This is a fantastic way to start every day. Had it last year, and couldn't do without it for 2013!
B005R32L66|2.0|Can anyone tell me if they have downloaded this version of skype on their Nextbook 8 Tablet? I<br />understand it may not work on android 4.0 tablets, so anyone who can offer some advice<br />would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King never lets me down. I read everything of his that I can get my hands on. Every time I read his stuff, I can't put it down until I get to the end.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I'm just an average reader and I'm surprised that such a thick book is so easy to read and understand. English is not my first language but I have no problems reading this book. It's so interesting that I didn't want to put it down. This book helps me understand so many things in life, especially people's behaviors and why they tend to like this or dislike that... The parts about how Paul O'Neill saved Alcoa and how Target knows which coupons should be sent to different groups of customers are just so eye-opening. After reading this book, I have so many good stories to tell my family and friends. I highly recommend this book to everyone, because I think anyone can benefit from it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was very hard to put this book down! Not your traditional sappy love story and has a great story line!
B00992CF6W|4.0|A fun game from a simple idea/design.  Not just a time-wasting app.  This is like portable electronic Legos, plus zombies.  My kids dragged me into this world and I can't get out!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the suspense was awesome an  I loved everything about it. I would ask everyone who loves a good romance to read this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Hands down one of the best books I've read all year. Finished it in two days. Couldn't put it down!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was such a great book!! If you are going to watch the movie, reading this book is a must!!
B0098460O4|5.0|I have never been an 'opera' fan, but I love all kinds of music and am always willing to try new artists. Jonathan & Charlotte have turned me into a fan. They're not really traditional opera, just great voices that could probably sing anything and make it sound wonderful. I initially saw them on Youtube; first their audition for Britain's Got Talent (which was amazing and made me tear up), then their second and final appearances. I have to admit, their story is what first got me interested, then when they began to sing, I was blown away! Just listening to them makes me feel happier...isn't that what music should do...engage your emotions? I can and do recommend this CD wholeheartedly. I encourage everyone to watch them on Youtube...you won't be disappointed. I wish them both the very best of luck.<br /><br />May 2013: Months later...still listening to and enjoying this CD. Hoping they either cut another CD soon or tour the USA!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book so much! It was wonderfully told. It clear explains the troubles faced by the participants of the Hunger Games.
B007S3S8HO|5.0|The Grandson is having a ball playing with his new DS game.  I also enjoy playing it occasionally, when he'll let me!  The game arrived on time as promised.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Ive never been great at math but with this app I don't need to be. I can now help my 5th grader with his homework. and it shows you the work. too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game. It gives me something to do when waiting, or just quick fun. It is not bad about the need of money too.  I like that a lot.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose to give this book all 5 stars because it was so realistic. Many of the problems and hardships that Charlie faced were easily relatable. I have ,at some time or another, experienced similar scenarios as he went through. I appreciated the humor and light-heartedness that was incorporated in the book, as well as the gut wrenching and disturbing details. I only wish that I knew who \\"friend\\" was because I am so curious of things like that, however, I realize that the mystery of the receiver of these letters only further signifies their insignificance to us as the readers. I have already recommended this book to many friends and family members. Certainly a pleasure to read, I'll be rereading it some time in the near future.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|nice job of making &#34;santa&#34; a family affair!  We enjoyed how the movie stressed the importance of each child. ok
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was another amazing read by EL James! I was so caught up in the book I found myself staying up way too late reading because I couldn't imagine putting it down! I am starting book three right now!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I just downloaded and started to use. I would highly recommend.  Easy to understand - great so far. Seems to have the features that others were missing.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|Certain movies take on broader social significance beyond the number of people who've actually seen them.  Catch phrases enter our culture from movies and people come to understand them even if they've never seen them.  Such is the case with \\"Network\\" a film whose catch phrase \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more\\" has been referenced so many times in popular culture that you know the movie's impact is quite broad and deep.  In fact that clip has become a meme of its own on the internet and YouTube, yet for all the people who grasp the phrase it's shocking how few have actually seen the movie and understand the point it was trying to make as it's one of the best satires ever made and clearly predicted the future of network television and media in general.<br /><br />Paddy Chayefsky, who provided the screenplay, had been involved with television since its earliest days, and \\"Network\\" is a look at the changes rippling through that industry as the first generation of pioneers gave way to the next and the tensions which result.  Television veterans such as division president Max Schumacher (William Holden) and anchor Howard Beale (the incomparable Peter Finch) find themselves at odds with a new generation of programmers like Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) and managers like Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) who want to radically reshape and remold television, and especially the news division in a more commercial way.  What ensues is the news division being subsumed into the entertainment division and a watering down of the reporting, a nod to the \\"infotainment\\" formula that would occur many decades later.  Chayefsky's screenplay clearly pointed towards what was coming in an astonishingly prescient way and the dialog is perhaps the sharpest satire I've ever witnessed.  The denouement of killing Howard Beale points towards the development of reality television in a way few could have expected.  While \\"Network\\" was satire at the time it ultimately wound up being astonishingly prescient as to what was coming to television.  The ensemble cast is perhaps the best imaginable and it's no wonder it was nominated for so many Oscars and that it won so many as well (for Finch, Dunaway, and Chayefsky).  It has also been selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for its cultural, historical and aesthetic significance.  One minor complaint is that most prints of this film suffer from a murky and blurry quality that makes the film look like a bad second or third generation copy.  Hopefully someone will properly restore this film to make it look better, but even the diminished quality of the prints doesn't detract from what the film is saying.  Miles ahead of other films released in that era!ing astonishingly prescient as to what was coming to television.

0792164903|4.0|This is not the most traditional telling of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow. However, it is a great interpretation and a fun story. Suitably creepy without some of the usual over-the-top of Tim Burton's movies.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Excellent adaptation of the book. The characters were protrayed true to form.  Hope the other two books make it to the big screen !!
B002BI6SMI|3.0|Kept wondering why all the guys my husband worked w/ seemed to love this movie so much, but after I saw it, I knew: How often do middle-aged men get to be the hero who rescues their baby girl?
B004EPYZSU|4.0|PLOT SPOILER later on...<br /><br />The title of this review is a joke. Reread it if you didn't notice.<br /><br />\\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" comes close to /being/ a joke. The title immediately grabs your attention -- but also suggests something shlocky from Troma. This might have been what kept audiences away.<br /><br />The film itself is not at all bad. John Favreau is an old hand at this sort of thing, and his direction is sure and steady. The casting is first-rate, especially Paul Dano as Harrison Ford's wayward (that's hardly the word) son. Dano gave an exceptional performance in \\"There Will Be Blood\\", and will someday be a major actor.<br /><br />The real problem is that, like \\"The Ice Pirates\\" (!!!), the storyline doesn't make sense. PLOT SPOILER Given that gold is produced by nucleosynthesis when stars explode, there's probably a lot of it in asteroids. (See the Wikipedia article on asteroid mining.) And if you insist on landing on a planet to mine gold -- why go around kidnapping natives and drawing attention to yourself? Duh.
B000AGTPUU|1.0|Polar Express ....IT hung up two times...stopped! But the sound would be on. What a big disappointment to get ready and play this and it hung up not once but two times. Not happy at all. Nope...Not happy at all. Is that enough words?:(
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|We enjoyed this film .. will there be another?  We watched the entire trilogy over the holidays and am a bit Batman-ed out for now.  Definitely not the Batman of the 70's ..
B002XTBE6K|5.0|My favorite production of Emma.  Love the costumes and scenery.  Can watch it over and over.  Love the Masterpiece series.
B008EKON56|5.0|I have heard that there are knock offs of this product out there. I just want to say that this is NOT a knock off. It fits tight enough into the iphone without falling out or being too tight. Works perfectly with the iphone 4s. I don't know about other models.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|My Son and I downloaded this and had a lot of fun with it over the holiday.  It is worth trying.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I read these after finishing the &#34;Throne&#34; book series and think they were quite well done.  The characters were realistic and the plot in each of the books well presented.  I'm taking a break from this genre for a while but will follow Joe Abercrombie's work because he has some different genres as well.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app won't sync with any of my games, which really sucks. They're supposed to be working on a fix, but nothing yet :-(
B005NFJAT4|4.0|Historically accurate, good characterization.  Portrays the actual battlefield and three day event of the turning point of the Civil War.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I manage several business accounts and this app makes it fast and easy for me to jump from one to another.  LOVE it!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was fabulous. Not too kind to your heart or feelings, but it was fabulous. I'm sure people will come to love this book.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This product is both unnecessary and an impediment.  Don't get it.  Now the required nine more time wasting words too.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love this product. It keeps everything in an easily accessible place and helps me to be very organised.<br />The best part is its free!!<br />This is the primary app I use on my kindle for all my documents, and I have no issues with it.<br />If you have a kindle this is a great app to have.

1469220660|5.0|Much better than Grey's Sylvia Day is a great writer I have read 5 of her books and have love everyone of them I wish that it was going to take until may 2013 for third book to come out.
1607066017|3.0|I expected to love this book based on the team behind it and the reviews that I had read. While it didn't live up to my expectations--which admittedly could have been too high to begin with--I found \\"Saga\\" to be an above average work and was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars. I would give 3.25 if I could and will cheerfully note that it shows loads of potential and has fine lead characters.<br /><br />Brain K. Vaughn delivers an interesting story in the first volume of \\"Saga\\" as he combines elements from fantasy and science fiction to craft his tale. Vaughn is excellent in pulling the strings on two characters who fall in love despite being on opposite sides of a war that has lasted forever. The art by Fiona Staples is solid, especially as she showcases a host of different races, creatures and settings.<br /><br />When Vaughn keeps his focus on characters, the book is excellent. His two leads are finely crafted. But the supporting cast is less fleshed out and the story often lags when they are in the spotlight. That happens more than it should and some readers can be excused if they get impatient waiting for the story to return to the lead couple. The pacing of the story seems a little off due to this constant shifting of focus. Having a child shown in the book act as the narrator when she is much older offers some needed commentary but seems a bit off when the book deals with characters and scenes that should be outside her realm of knowledge.<br /><br />Vaughn has an impressive imagination. There are some very interesting ideas here but there are some that simply fall flat. This speculative setting could have used a bit more consistency and logic. The two lead characters will last with the reader more than the fantastic setting Vaughn has created. Some of the violence and sex in the book was very gratuitous and the \\"M\\" rating on the book was well deserved. Simply put, this is not a graphic novel for younger readers.<br /><br />While \\"Saga\\" did not live up to myhigh expectations--and I will probably read the book again and perhaps change my review--it is not a bad book by any means. It's a solid work that shows loads of potential. I have enough faith in Vaughn and and Staples to keep an eye on future volumes of \\"Saga.\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The kids and I really enjoy this game! Lots of fun! Can't wait to try the other games that they offer!
B0029XFNA8|2.0|This product was not what it says it is.  The jacket cover says it is a colorized version and it is black and white.  I don't appreciate the misrepresentation on this product.  There is not a selection on the disc for a colorized version.  I have already checked out all the features and there is not a colorized selection.  I really wanted the colorized version.  I tried to call customer service and they said there was not a colorized available.  So why does it say it is colorized on the jacket?
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great book I couldn't put it down lots of twist and turns well worth the read<br />Hopefully the story dose not end here
B004O3YGMC|1.0|followed instructions on web site. tried Windows 7 and 8 with no luck. ports forwarded, firewall off, a/v disabled...No connection...useless to me...good luck

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Now I see what all the fuss was about...I'm a little behind the times, and just played my first game of Angry Birds on my new Kindle Fire...super fun and addictiing! The only thing I don't like about the free app is that you have to deal with the pop-up ads...no biggie though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing.  The storyline kept me going.  I completed the book in one day; could not put it down.
0316227706|1.0|I received this book as a gift and was completely offended that anyone would think this an appropriate gift for any animal lover.  Horrible!  Do not waste your money.  I would give it \\"no stars\\" if that was an option.  I don't know who the reviewers are, but they must be on the payroll.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I can honestly say that I have not gotten engrossed in a TV show in over ten years. American Horror Story was fantastic and Asylum is even better. It's well written and filmed. The acting is stellar, and as seen in all of her wok, Lou Eyrich does wonders with wardrobe. Between Eyrich and Lange Minnesota's potential for talent is truly demonstrated. The show is not afraid to step on toes when it comes to controversy. The visual imagery is wonderful as well. If you don't mind creepy, I'd give this show a go.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|It feels good to relive the show i having the entire series.  It still holds up after so many years and nice to have as we received as a Christmas gift.  Came asap and well worth the price
B0086700CM|5.0|My family are basically competing over this. Yawn. I'm just on the sidelines of those things. The app has been a lot OK free so.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|An interesting and fun puzzle game that causes one to think a bit especially after the 5X5 boards. The early sets are a good warm up and practice. Afterwhich the patterns are more challenging.
B005PK553C|4.0|The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because I don't think I'd be doing American Horror Story Asylum justice by giving season 1 the same ranking. Check them out. Both seasons are so creepy, and so well written and performed. I've been waiting for a really good ghost story for so long now, and American Horror Story finally delivered! I can't wait to see what season 3 has in store.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I love Janet Evanovich books, especially the Stephanie Plum series.  So I try to purchase some of her other books too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a puzzle game that i can't stop playing! I have had it for 3 day and i haven't been able to put it down. And my mom who isn't into these kind of things loved it!
B009E3EY38|5.0|This was a great purchase!  If you love Led Zeppelin, you have to own a copy of this...price is right, too.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas (sort of) as a gag gift, since he's always joking about the &#34;imminent&#34; Zombie Apocalypse. But actually this book has some interesting theories and tips if you're into the zombie culture movement.
0891419063|5.0|I've read the book and listened to the audiobook narrated by George Wilson, if that's important to you...and I'll mention what I thought of the audiobook, too.<br /><br />Anyways:<br /><br />5 stars, easily one of the best war memoirs out there. I've read quite a few, from multiple POVs and multiple conflicts. Still, Sledge beats them all.<br /><br />I would give a summary of the book but better reviewers have already done that, I'll just mention that the descriptions of life on the frontline, of combat with a fanatical enemy and in two staggeringly gruesome battles of the Pacific War are all top notch. There is one part of the book involving souvenir hunters that is just so disconcerting. The scene was in the mini-series The Pacific and it was not nearly as harrowing.<br /><br />Concerning the audiobook:<br /><br />I usually end up getting used to and enjoying most audiobook narrators and that's what happened with this one. I think the narrator (George Wilson), an older gentleman, is who is the type of narrator usually sought out for these types of books (Beyond Valor, Hell in the Pacific, Cutthroats, Code Talker and Quartered Safe Out Here all feature older narrators, the latter being the best and by the author) but I think these books would benefit from having younger or less-older sounding narrators. This is probably best exemplified by the narrators of Helmet for My Pillow or A Rumor of War or even Beyond Band of Brothers.<br /><br />tl;dr: I'd still give the audiobook version 5 stars.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love immediately with Augustus Waters. I truly wish that he were real. My new favorite author. thank you for bringing such a beautiful book into the world.
B00006RIO7|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS TERRIFFIC SO I BOUGHT THE CD SO I CAN PLAY THE MUSIC IN THE CAR. I CAN LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC OVER AND OVER
B005VPRG10|5.0|Great product, as always. My husband loves getting LEGOs still for Christmas, and he's been waiting to have the Tie Fighter... already put together and looking good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Quick and fun game. Easy to learn.  Very colorful.  Higher levels take some thought to solve. One of first games I tried on new tablet.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I expected the book to be intense, but I was pleasantly surprised  to find a really good story. The characters were well developed and I could not put it down.
0345803507|5.0|I READ ALL THREE BOOKS AND I LOVED THEM ALL. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOKS DOWN ONCE I STARTED READING.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|I will watch this one again and again.  My first movie purchase, it will be hard to top.  Great buy!
0385528752|3.0|I had to read this for work related discussion. The concept of the rider and the elephant was interesting. Overall an ok read.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|My husband loves this singer and her  CD's.  We have them all.  Melody has a true voice and sings with imagery and passion
B006BG7RI0|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE JUST LOVES IT. IT HAS LOTS OF EXTRAS THAT YOU JUST DON'T GET WITH A REGULAR DVD.
B0079R8IYW|2.0|I had purchased a Marware cover for my first Kindle Fire and thought I was getting the same thing due to the description and pictures. It, however, was so bad I went to Staples and purchased one for $5.00 that was exactly what I wanted.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|the last book in these series it was good,one of those books I couldn't put down. could read it again.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|If you like the show, then you should add this to your DVD collection.  Wait till it goes on sale and scoop it up.
B004SIP6A4|5.0|WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL DVD BUT NOW WE HAVE IT IN BLUE RAY. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.WE ARE GOING TO WATCH IT THIS WEEKEND.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I decided to rent this movie after several friends raved about it. First of all, I feel is was misbilled by the trailers which portrayed it to be funny and somewhat lighthearted. The storyline was choppy and disjointed and the content was much darker than I expected. All in all, Channing is pretty to look at but this movie is terrible.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is sooooooooooooooooo fun you can play with friends make a person a girl or boy game is so fun
B001DEVZUG|5.0|Excelent CD to add to my Annie Lennox collection.  Haven't watched the DVD yet, but will get around to it.
B006P0FIGU|3.0|If you're a big fan of Barry Sonnenfeld's 1999 steam-punk remake of Wild Wild West, then you'll probably love this interpretation of The Three Musketeers.<br /><br />The story casts Logan Lerman as D'Artagnon, Mathew MacFayden as Athos, Luke Evans as Arimis, and Ray Stevenson as Titus Pullo, a Roman Legionaire who's skill with a sword is matched only by his love of wine and women. Actually, Stevenson plays Porthos, the musketeer who's skill with a sword is matched only by his love of wine and women. The story begins in the early 17th century when French black ops  team consisting of Athos, Porthos, and Arimis break into a super-secret underground vault in Venice to steal Leonardo Davinci's secret plans for giant for schooner shaped dirigibles. The manage to steal the plans only to have Athos girlfriend Milady (played by Milla Jovavich) betray them to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). From there we go to rural France where D'Artagnon, the son of an impoverished former musketeer leaves home to seek fortune and adventure as a swordsman.<br /><br />From that point on it's all fights and chases. It's just like every other Three Musketeer movie except a lot of the action centers on high speed chases and aerial cannon battles between wooden blimp. Also, many of the musketeers have very modern super-abilities.  Portho has the super strength to rip chains out of the wall. Another Musketeer has a steam-punk frogman suit. Another dives off rooftops like Batman. Miady is a super cat burglar with grappling lines hidden in her clothing.<br /><br />The Three Musketeers is basically silly fun. 9 year old boys will love it for the swordfights, blimp chases and explosions. 13 year old boys will like it even more for the exposed cleavage.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'M GLAD I READ THE WHOLE SERIES. AFTER BOOK ONE I HAD TO CONTINUE!<br />I HAVE TO SAY THERE WERE TOO MANY REDUNDENT COMMENTS AND WORDS....AND NO ONE COULD HAVE SEX THAT MUCH, SO I WONDER WHERE THE AUTHOR GOT HER IDEAS!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Inspiring and wonderful.  A total joy to read.  I couldn't put it down.  Everyone should read this book.  It made me smile.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This movie I had to add to my collection for the price.  Already had it on DVD, but blu-ray is the way to go for sci-fi movies or TV shows that have special effects.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and granddaughter because they just love Carly Rae Jepson and they love the cd.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book and movie are different but after reading the book I believe that the movie does the book justice.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|You can only see the top few posts, They need to improve this, the one for my phone is great!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Criminal Minds season 6 is another great season. It has it all from interesting cases to great topics and a lot of fun conversations. Criminal minds remains to be a great show!!!
B004SRNH10|2.0|I guess if there are any foxes for the Hunt Club, who really are determined<br />that I use Adobe Flash software in my media applications, I've led them<br />right to the warren. Where the wascally wabbits like me have decided to<br />say no. I personally have not experienced sound distortion until the last<br />two weeks, and I finally decided. I have uninstalled Flash player for the<br />last time. It's good that computer warriors have fought Dix, fought locusts,<br />come out to certain homes of rabbits who just are not interested---let me<br />say that. If you cannot appreciate my humor, maybe you can appreciate humor<br />better than black water in my pot. At the present time, I am recovering.<br />You, my fellow surfers and internet media aficionados are more for the<br />chase, or the challenge. At the present time, I can watch some fairly<br />decent videos on YT flanked by the most impressive HD commercials I have<br />seen on the web or on any digital communications. I have nothing against<br />Adobe, but I am not spending anymore time making a Google or a Cloud or<br />an HTTP application function so that I can watch ads all day. I did my part.<br />I tried. It's 3rd party software just like Nullsoft apps are 3rd party software<br />so the designers are going to have find a better way to accomplish something.<br />The problems like distortion and dissonance have been going on since June.<br />I'm done with troubleshooting, and I will pursue different roads. When I have to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I've played for months and never get tired of it. Every month they change the city and add new characters and power ups.
3527406018|5.0|This text breaks new ground as it is accessible to advanced undergrads.  It is well written, a pleasure to read.  In a few places, like the ad hoc use of langrangians in the gauge theory section, I would like to see more interpretation.  And I have seen more appealing presentations of Dirac's equation.  But, overall, I give this book an A.<br /><br />Paul Kunasz
B009LRE040|5.0|Unfortunately the trilogy is over, but it went out with a bang! The Dark Knight Rises has it all, from a great plot, to a ton of action. This is certainly the best of the three. Not only are the new characters a success also the new Batman gadgets are superb. I think it is a must-see and therefore recommend it to everyone!
B00361CAEE|4.0|This is another movie I watched out of curiosity, not expecting to like it too much based on other reviews.  I thought that it was going to be unpleasant at the beginning, however I stuck with it and was gradually drawn in and found it most fascinating. Grace Coddington is indeed worth watching this movie for, her work is remarkable. I found, too, that by watching her work (and having just finished a bio of Diana Vreeland) it gave me a whole new perspective on the pictures she produces. I had looked at Vouge in the past and thought that pictures like these were just silly-who can look like this and go out in the street or to their job, for pete's sake! Now I understand that these pictures are about color, and line, and atmosphere, and intended to inspire creativity rather than as a formula or recipe. Of course, Coddington also does pictures of real clothes as they are meant to be worn and these are interesting and inspiring too- as Wintour herself says, \\"Grace is a genius\\", and it's always exciting to watch someone who is really doing what they are meant to do in life.  I also found Wintour a surprise. I expected not to like her, and at first I didn't, however as the movie went on I came to both admire her work ethic and appreciate her judgement and decisiveness , with one LARGE caveat. Apparently, she is the one single person who has placed real fur back center stage of fashion, and continues to push it relentlessly. I don't understand this and I found that it tainted my otherwise favorable impression of her. Tim Gunn says \\"fur belongs in the dustbin of history\\"  and he is quite right. It is annoying and archaic that Wintour can't see this,  especially in this modern age of remarkably beautiful and luxurious faux furs. Aside from this large point however, she presented as hard working, beautiful, and unexpectedly charming (though I must say it's a bit scary how she ALWAYS looks absolutely PERFECT.) I wish she would get over herself with regard to fur.
B005HSG3U6|1.0|I have not had a case for my kindle for the last year, and I have thrown it in my bag every day to go to school and it never even got a scratch. I bought this case, used it for 2 days, and pulled it out of my bag when I got to school, and my screen was shattered. I do NOT recommend this case!!!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Nothing fancy about this.<br />Just a great copy of a terrific classic title!<br />If you have never read this classic work you MUST!!!<br />It is one of the top books of all times.<br />Read the book then see the movie!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford & Sons newest album, Babel, is another great presentation of lyrics and great atmosphere.  I especially enjoy their cover song &#34;the Boxer&#34;, which has a great flow to it and established itself as a marvelous cover!!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Excelente vendedor, la entrega se realizo en el tiempo estipulado y el producto llego en excelentes condiciones, recomendado muy agradecido.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|After a few weeks of use, it became obvious that one size does not fit all. Also, the travel of the key is not always perpendicular and this travel angle is determined by the size of the hand, the placement of the fingers and other ergonomics I will not go into at this time. Suffice it to say, Logitech really could have done some smart things on this, but only did that required to beat the competition. By the way, if you have done any searches on the competition, those numbers are dwindling fast. At the moment, there is an oligopoly manufacturing these devices. Competition lacks and so the requirements are not high. A lot of easy sales for them. This could have been a revolutionary product with multi-angle perpendicular travel for some of the rows of keys. I say, provide a revolutionary device, leave the costly electronic display out.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|What can I say? It was free! It was easy! And it was mindless fun!<br />I do not often play games. And I do not often keep playing games.<br />This one was fun for a short while until it got redundant...<br />Sad to say it is not still currently on my device.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I believe this is the best Step Up in the sequence yet. The story line is somewhat similar to Step Up 3, but the dances are breath taking once again!!! I enjoyed every moment of it, especially the mob in the art gallery!!! I recommend it to everyone who wants to see an upbeat film!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely  love this app the first time i played it i was like now i want it so bad.
0307346617|5.0|It was everything I wanted it to be, read it front to back in three days!  The condition of the book was of concern as I never purchased a book from Amazon before, it was in pristine condition.  Intend to purchase other books by Max Brooks, I love everything Zombie!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not stop, this is one emotionally charged book. wow wow wow. This book addresses many pressing issues not talked about. Twists and turns that kept you guessing and wanting to find out the answers. Both Holder and Sky are brilliant characters. This book pulled at heart strings, made me laugh, made me sad and made me happy. The last chapter was a great end to this book. Loved loved loved.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think this book is very good for children. It will extend their vocabularies and minds. It is important for kids not only to know the word, but how to use it as well.

B005QI4TP8|4.0|Great sound, somewhat reminiscent of Eurythmics and Fiona Apple but much more spirited and full of sound, carries you away in the best sense of what music can do.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Not the conventional teen fiction book. I enjoyed the struggle of piecing together Charlie's jumbled thoughts and stories. Really makes you think.

B004Y1USV2|3.0|Trying to like this album, sounds of the progressive rock are there and the vocals are likable even without Jon Anderson (never thought I'd say that!).  Produced by Trevor Horn but still lacking excitement when compared to Talk, 90215, The Ladder or Union.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Got this game for Journey, was NOT disappointed.  Still have not played the other two games but still worth it even if I never get around to them.

B003ZMF26W|4.0|I love this mouse!  The only issue I have which may or may not bother anyone else is that the scroll wheel squeaks when I use it.  It started maybe a day or two after I got it, and hasn't stopped.  Other than that, nothing bad to say about it.  It's comfortable, I like the rubberized grip on the sides and the red lights!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was much better that the movie. It has more detailed accounts of how Katnis felt. You should. Definitely read this amazing book. 5 stars for sure.

0553573403|1.0|I bought the entire series for my husband as a Christmas gift, and he told me yesterday that he had to stop reading it. He began with a Game of Thrones and couldn't put it down. There were things in there that kept bothering him (like the incessant pedophilia and incest), but he pressed on hoping that Martin would not turn out as amoral on these issues. But then he got to some pretty graphic parts. Last night he showed me a page of some really inappropriate descriptions. He loves reading C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, and so from what he read online, George R.R. Martin seemed a logical conclusion for some good fantasy. From what he told me, Martin is an excellent, descriptive, and creative writer.<br /><br />I am by no means prudish about sex. I am married, and my husband and I have all sorts of discussions about it and we share between each other what husbands and wives SHOULD regarding sex. But I do not talk about the mechanics of it with other people or give descriptions of it to other people. Only my husband. Since Martin has a gifted writing ability and is able to paint vivid pictures in your head by mere writing, then as you could imagine, the graphic descriptions of sexual acts in his book are also able to put pictures in your head.<br /><br />If you are okay with looking at pornography, then you are going to be totally okay with reading this book. If you are NOT okay with looking at pornography, then you will NOT be okay with reading this book.<br /><br />I am not about to get into a debate of whether pornography is appropriate or not, but reader beware, porn is there! Yes, the real world has people performing all sorts of disgusting acts (like rape, incest, pedophilia, etc), but just know that he is writing to paint a vivid picture of the mechanics of the sexual act. Obviously there are a lot of people out there that enjoy reading erotic novels, and so will not have a problem with this book. I have never read Fifty Shades of Grey, nor do I plan to. But I know enough about it NOT to read it. A Song of Ice and Fire series is basically like a Fantasy version of Fifty Shades of Grey. Yes, completely different story-line and writing style, I am sure. But both are inappropriate, erotic, pornographic novels.<br /><br />So just be forewarned before you throw away money like we did.ow enough about it NOT to read it.

B008K8H9C6|1.0|This was the first purchase I ever made for my new Kindle Fire. I was never warned that it wouldn't work, but when I tried to get it, I was told to go to the Appstore and install it. But it was never there.<br /><br />Yeah, it's just $1.00 -- but I still feel like Amazon cheated me by not letting me install it.<br /><br />EDIT: After I ran a \\"Sync\\" on my Kindle Fire, this app finally showed up. Of course this was AFTER I had gone ahead and purchased the Kindle Fire version of the app, so it doesn't really do me any good. Nevertheless, the low rating was really more for Amazon and their failure to make it super-clear that if you're missing an app, you need to run a Sync and look for it in the Cloud.<br /><br />At some point in the near future, I'll try running the \\"Premium\\" version on my Kindle to see if it works; I'll revise the rating accordingly if it does. However, since there's one that's specifically FOR the Kindle, I'd still recommend getting that one instead (if that's the system on which you'll be playing it).
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the Solitaire game!!  It seems to relax me when I play.  I have always played Solitaire in some form or another.  With real cards or on the computer.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|great game even though it's sort of hard five stars for this game by the way this game is for all ages
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This movie is good for anyone who loves baseball. Even if you dont really like sports, it's still a good movie about a father and a daughter.
B005HSL626|3.0|I have not played Fruit Ninja very much yet but so far it is fun.  I am sure that I will play it a lot more when I have more free time.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I was skeptical about this movie and the whole talking teddy bear thing. I love family guy and the movie is very funny. Of course there are a few parts that are too over the top but that can be expected in these kind of movies. Mark whalberg does a great job as well.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I saw the movie on Christmas Day and was enthralled.  Then my friend told  me she had downloaded the soundtrack from Amazon for only $5, so I went directly and bought it.  It is wonderful to hear the beautiful renditions of the well-loved music sung by the actors with so much emotion!  I recommend this to everyone.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Glad I could complete my collection and at a really good price!  Christmas is such a good time to shop.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe reader rarely disappoints me. Pretty sure Kindles  can read PDF docs, but it is nice to have a backup program, especially if you want to read some PDF doc online.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|this app is so dependable I never have to wonder. or squint to try and figure out the bar. is it full?  do I start a movie? this app never lets me down I love it well worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this.  game its awesome I would recommend it to everyone I know. unlimited fun for everyone get it ill be addicted promise
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Very thin plot. Mostly worn out jokes about body parts and gas. They missed a great opportunity to make a funny movie. Mark Wahlberg was solid as usual but the writing was weak and Ted came off as being creepy instead of cute. Hopefully we won't see a Ted2.
B006O3MU96|4.0|Fun for adults, but a little difficult for young kids.  I enjoy the challenge of trying to avoid the little alien guys.
B005XLN97M|5.0|A great toy for the price, my five year old is completely satisfied with this and it was a lot cheaper than other houses... mommy likes it too!
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Liked the color and fits great.  For an inexpensive sleeve this is a great looking and fitting sleeve.  I would recommend.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Some of the puzzles were too difficult to figure out on my own.  And the end came a lot sooner than expected.  Still very nice graphics.
0061124958|5.0|Great quality... I'm very happy with this purchase. FYI - there isn't a book cover, just thought I'd share! It didn't bother me...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  The story like goes all over, but over all, it was a great read!  Wish she would have written them with a better plot line
B009O07NDY|4.0|I'm almost embarrased to write this review, as I am a gilt-edged fan of LOTR and especially of Shore's academy award winning score, paired with Annie Lennox' haunting end song. My overall feeling across two disks, is that there was a whole lot of copying done from the LOTR score. There are no really major new themes, except perhaps for Radagast, a brand new kind of character. At all the high points, it is LOTR scenes which spring to mind, not \\"The Hobbit\\" scenes; however, I have only scene the film once so far. I will be doubly disappointed if in Part II, there is not a really gorgeous theme for his nastiness, the dragon, Smaug (I am similarly anticipating Benedict Cumberbatch's voice talent as the voice of Smaug.) There are two pieces which stand out, in contrast to this \\"sameness\\", and both are performed by the dwarves. The first is the brief song the dwarves sing, \\"Blunt the Knives\\" as they are cleaning up after the \\"Unexpected Party\\". The second is the low song \\"Misty Mountains\\" performed by the dwarves, esp. Richard Armitrage.I have heard Neil Finn's \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain\\" earlier, and I thought it was better than Enya's contributions to LOTR, but not as good as \\"Into the West.\\"<br /><br />Other reviews have done a fine job of itemizing opinions on the cuts. I think the overall impression, for one steeped in LOTR, is not enough new stuff. I was waiting for at least one new major theme to stand out, but I didn't find it. This is subject to revision as I see the movie at least once more, and see how sight and sound are joined.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It has 5 planets and 173 levels (this includes bonus). NONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR. THIS IS THE BEST ANGRY BIRDS GAME EVER!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The beginning few chapters are very confusing to read.  I never really knew what she was trying to get across.  I wish the author would have done more with the wedding, and Ana giving birth to their first baby.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun game to pass time and is nice because there is so many games in one. You can also earn points easily to unlock New games, which is nice.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Just discovered this artist. Lianne La Havas delivers a pure sound.  The lyrics are beautiful.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I adore Phillip Phillips and I love his voice. This CD doesn't disappoint. He stayed true to the sound we heard from him on American Idol which is perfect. Super stoked that I got the bonus track CD too. I would definitely recommend it. In short, it's feel good music that is easy to listen too! love it!
B009O2XY12|3.0|You can download this for free, but then to keep going up levels you need to spend cash to go further.  Not what I expected.
1595825045|5.0|I got this for Christmas and I couldn't be happier! It has so much more information then the special episodes that included pop-up facts. I agree with a previous reviewer that says I wish they made one for every book! If you love Avatar, or want to brush up on the World after watching Korra, BUY THIS BOOK!!
B005H0YP7W|4.0|i do enjoy Emeli her voice is crisp and pure, my only reservation with this project is that the production seemed very cheap and left otherwise amazing songs feeling somewhat empty, the lyrics and vocals are Amazing the production however, leaves a lot to be desired its almost as if her producers just threw random beats under her vocals...
B000005RUV|5.0|Replacing vinyl as I go so I knew what I was getting with this one.  Enjoy listening to the old stuff now and then.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain's line of reasoning is original and the product of years of dedicated research.  It is a rare book that will likely shift any reader's way of seeing himself or the world in general.  Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking relies on a survey of psychological research and modern history to make its point.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read while on vacation<br />Looking forward to the next two books in the series<br />Highly recommend the book series
B00AE2J93I|4.0|Not too childish and not to adult.  The animation was excellent and there wasn't a dull moment to be found.
B00884GR0W|1.0|This game stinks.  Its controls are hard to learn and its so hard to do anything. I don't recommend it!!!!!!
B000005RQT|5.0|This remastered cd is one of the great ones.  Excellent job, and it sound way superior to the original cd from 1990.  It also now has not one but two versions of Black Night and there both great.  The cd was also in great condition.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Love the series!, got it for my husband.  However there were a few times that we experienced some glitches, and break ups of flow! Otherwise fun to get involved.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have a 4 year old and an 8 year old the both love playing this game.  Both have lots of fun playing it.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|This cd was the first one with David Coverdale and he does a great job filling in Ian Gillans shoes. The music is great and this probably the next best album to Machine Head.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Jeremy Renner does a good job with his character but the whole storyline is lacking the usual Bourne punch.  The movie ending sneaks up on you and leaves you trying to comprehend what was the point of the whole picture.  The tie-in with the last movie is weak to say the least.  Another sequel has to clarify what the heck you just witnessed and where it's headed to from here!!!!!!
B007WFTFG6|5.0|I have an 8 year old and an 4 year old that loves painting pictures and showing them off.  Wonderful App
B000MCADQ2|5.0|I can't believe I am writing this but I think the bonus cd sounds better than the original album.  I guess that's why they included it.  At first I was just going to listen to the remastered version of this album, but out of curiosity I put the bonus cd in and I was blown away.  Both cd's are great and they were in great condition.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great characters in a light and lively college environment with a pretty good story line.<br />The songs and accompanying dance routines definitely rally you to the underdog &#34;Bellas&#34;.<br />A good refreshing deviation from the prolific offerings of Superheroes, Wizards, and Borderline Porn.<br />If your looking for a feel good movie that delivers on &#34;Entertainment&#34;, I would not miss &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34;.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|i bought this as part of a gift so i am told that they like it very much i didn't see it at all so i am going by what they told me
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Wow! Great price for this product. Purchased as a last minute gift for Christmas and was pleased that it arrived in plenty of time to wrap and place under the tree.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie and great job!  This is a real collectors film from Pixar.  Will become a classic in time.  Blu Ray is very well put together.
0425263908|3.0|This book is pretty much the SAME as 50 shades.....but there is more detail adult reading which was cool. I liked reading the adult part, but the story line was pretty much exactly as 50 shades, but all in 1 book (not 3). wish they would have come up with somethign more original.
B005C9YZIM|5.0|I searched several stores for this product and was able to find it...but at a higher price. Was excited to find it on line at a cheaper price. And my son absolutely adores his gift.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I love love love this movie.  I bought it and passed the tradition of watching it on Christmas Eve (to my nephew) and maybe next year my new niece will be able to enjoy it as well.  It's such a wonderous movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Constantly kept me on my toes. I was constantly switching sides, but in the end the outcome was merely what I expected.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Great internet connection but kept buffering and freezing. Paid extra for HD version and was informed AFTER purchase that it would not show in HD if slow connection etc. Most of the movie was not in HD. Will just rent from Redbox or Apple TV. Apple TV at least downloads enough before start to watch without buffering. The movie itself was decent
B009K45Y62|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time.  Action packed from the beginning to the epic conclusion.  Best movie of the year!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone needing a great love story. enjoyed it from start to finish . can't wait for book #2
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love EVERYTHING about Pinterest. I can use it for decorating ideal now or future. Looking for a new receipt Pinterest has it. new party ideas, craft ideas you can find it on Pinterest.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought one of these for my 13 year-old daughter and my 11 year-old niece and they have been a huge hit with the whole family.  It's often very frustrating, and I don't think we'll get all the way through it in one go, but it's fun to see how far you can get.  I would recommend the easier versions for kids 10 and under.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This book had me transfixed from the beginning.  The whole JFK thing doesn't have that much interest for me as I am not American.<br /><br />You don't have to have an interest in JFK to become engrossed in this book, it is eventless (it could have been about any major historical event) and timeless, pun intended:-)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Couldn't put it down! The characters we very easy to register too...If you are a Sparks fan this one will not disappoint!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Smooth graphics, nice music, and very relaxing game play.  This is definitely one of the nicer pick-3 games available today.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addictive and fun.  If you don't have this game, you need it ASAP.  This was even better because it was free!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Very user friendly. My 8 year old loves to play it with us! It is very easy to us and I like the colors.
B001ANSS5K|1.0|I did not enjoy this book. I finished it merely because I spent money on it and felt like I had to. The plot is stupid and it takes forever and when you finally get to the end, it is completely not worth the time it took to read the book. Don't waste your money. His other books are 100 times better.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderful! Couldn't put it down!  It was really a great read and had a good story line! Very exciting story!
B001USHRCK|5.0|My boys are crazy for legos, and they love to set up knights and protect the people. It's a fun set.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My 5 year old has played a few other angry bird games and loves it.  He enjoys the building process and matching the design on the card.  He did notice one of the cards uses 3 of the little birds and not the bigger bird with a mustache.  This confused him because the game only comes with 2 little ones.  This game seemed higher quality than the other one we had (On thin Ice) because the pigs are rubberized like the birds, not hard slick plastic like &#34;on thin ice&#34;.  This has made it easier to build and place the pigs on the towers.  Awesome way to play off of the tablet!!
B002XXLKHY|5.0|If you don't watch this during the Christmas season, you might be a Grinch. Just rent or buy it, whatever you prefer.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Maybe I've been reading for too many years but after all of the publicity for this trilogy, I was a little disappointed.  Purchased the first of 3 - not sure if I'll buy the others or not.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great app!  runs great with close to no glitches what so ever. definetly recommend downloading!  finally a facebook app for kindle fire!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking up married. Enjoyed it so much. Looking forward to reading more from the author. Well worth time to read.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good social networking tool.  Can be addictive, but a great way to stay in touch with friends and family!  Don't like the new advertisements tho.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I enjoyed this movie mostly because of the action.  The plot did not seem well developed, but it was a sequel. I wasn't expecting much plot development.<br /><br />The actors/actresses in it are some of my favorites, so I would have watched it regardless.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was a really good example of what all of the teenage winner girls acted like twilight was. Definitely has more depth and character intricacy than the twilight series. I'm definitely going to continue on reading the rest of the trilogy. Great job ms Collins.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is certainly 'mind' challenging - just wish that there were more 'game' options after completing the intial game. Why not have a second game with other countries, etc.,
0812993357|3.0|The book is written in a way that is very easy to read, and sometimes not easy to follow. As Graces starts a chapter with an statement and yet, it takes tot eh end of the chapter for her to make her point. Her stories are interesting to read, but not shocking. Her book recaps, the transition of the fashion industry in a very honest way. Her tragedies and her successes are secondary to the story telling. The sketches that she has drawn are the highlights of the book. She is a brilliant stylist, her visual work outweighs her written words.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game was awesome I couldn't put it down untill I beat it! it had really good graphics and interesting storyline that just pulled me in an I really started to feel like a detective it was great! this game was defiantly worth paying for an  hope to get the sequel:)
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Fun to play and the graphics are great - would recommend for almost any age group.  Love the 'birds' with their light sabers, etc.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A really good book. It draws you in, and when you want more<br />Action, you get it. Read the book.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Not a great app, should be free. Why have a camera in the Kindle if you need to pay for an app?
0800141660|4.0|The kind of movie that I like to add to my library collection because of the life style, manners, etc. that I want my family to emulate.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Interesting direction for a movie now a days.  Very creative and funny.  Worth watching at least once.  Don't let the kids watch due to alot of swearing and sexual behavior.
B004SIP7AS|4.0|The kind of movie that I like to add to my library collection because of the life style, manners, etc. that I want my family to emulate.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the Walking Dead and my computer streamed this video without a hitch. I just wish I would have bought HD the first time.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Our family really got hooked on the Walking Dead Series on amc. We ordered season II from amazon.com and were amazed at the price, packaging, and quick arrival. Now we can continue the series at home on our families time schedule.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game play is fast and fun. requires lots of fast tapping on the screen. Like it so far but haven't played to much yet.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This movie, is one of my favorites. I bought it on AMAZON and it was a great price.. It was categorized under that it has been previously opened, but it was &#34;like&#34; brand new... Me, trusting the website had bought it. It arrived when it said it would,,,and when I put it in my DVD player, it skipped from the start. I of course, blamed my DVD player thinking maybe it was broken..But I tried putting the DVD in my computer, and it did the same. I cleaned the DVD and tried to play it in my roommates dvd player and it wouldn't. I will NEVER again pay for a USED dvd and will pay the extra couple bucks to buy a new dvd. I am very upset with this product. Don't believe when they write that it's LIKE NEW&#62; save yourself the trouble and time.. Buy the new DVD. UNOPENED&#62;
B005EGXNLS|5.0|As with so many of Cornwell's works, this book is spectacular. It is well-researched, the characters are compelling and interesting, and the action is absolutely grounded in real history. Cornwell consistently writes action sequences better than any other author I've read. This is an absolutely brilliant continuation of The Saxon Chronicles. I highly recommend it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|G5 has quite a few great games of the hidden object/adventure genre. I have not been disapointed with any of them so far. Dark Arkana is no exception. Fun to play.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|One of the most interesting series on tv in a very long time.  I will definitely continue to watch the show.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|Bob's latest offering in his prolific catalog !  Bob's still the master of his craft. You won't go wrong with this vinyl record.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|the case is cute but dont stand butbut i do love the black color and leather texture but that it
B0064SHI9I|3.0|Seems like a good app, but their servers have been down for weeks. It does seem straightforward and easy to use.
159420411X|1.0|Nothing new and insightful, repetitive, waste of time and money. The  book is slow to read (was not expecting it to be a thriller either) and takes so long to explain even the simplest of things. Well, I fell for the hype.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This is a good book to read if you are looking for some laughs but it's quite short, but don't be surprised when you think the book has just started but it has already bloody ended.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|this is a awesome show, i loved watching it over & over... its good quality & came in a timely manor!!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Like every other review I read I am stating the same thing. The ads are extremely annoying! If I wanted to see this many ads I would turn on the TV and read the local newspaper at the same time. While the game play is amazing (only having to tap once to move a card) the ads ruin what could be a great app. I hate being interrupted between every single game because of ads. I understand the game is free but this is ridiculous. The plus side to this game if you manage to ignore the ads is being able  to change the card backing and the color of the background. It states you can use your  own photos for the background however, that did not work when I tried.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It made history within the first weekend. The Avengers was no doubt  the best film of 2012 bar none. I Love it I saw the movie 3 times in the month of may, The first weekend and then memorial day weekend saturday and sunday
B007VUCAVO|1.0|Would not calibrate the battery on my Kindle Fire HD. It will not go past video calibration stage. It says that the video is not supported on the Kindle Fire HD.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I loved the 2nd season of Downton Abbey - cannot wait for season 3 which starts in 10 days.  Beautifully acted - fabulous scenery.  Love the authentic costumes.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|Hard not to like this album.  Was not a fan of the Stones when they first came out but musical tastes change over the years and I find the three disks with this album, which is great value, covers most of their most energetic and special performances.  Great album.
B004GYY714|4.0|Looks like it's very user friendly, however I have not used it enough to properly evaluate at this time. I like the layout
B0063IH60K|4.0|I chose 4 stars because it is not GREAT. good for people who like solitaire. I would recommend it for anybody who likes to play
1451696191|5.0|Grand daughter wanted this book for Christmas.  It was the only book she requested.  It was recommended to her by her friends.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|this was so far fetched.  i knew it would be going into it. i mean its abe lincoln and vamps. but some of the actions were just ugh!
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Sturdy and light weight. Will be purchasing another for my son's kindle.  It holds the kindle in place very well with no worries of it falling out.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is a fun DVD with some great music. I think it is a great find for anyone who loves the blues.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The saga of the Winchester boys keep taking twists and turns that suprise and please. Sci-Fi has always been my thing, and this is the best series so far for Sci-Fi!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|In love with Christian and Ana and this trilogy!  A true love story with a mixture of erotica! Perfect!  Asked my husband to read them, they are so good!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Can read and read over and over. Recommended for ages 12 and up. Whole series is a must-read. Just awesome.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In love with Christian and Ana and this trilogy!  A true love story with a mixture of erotica! Perfect!  Asked my husband to read them, they are so good!
B000FBHC7S|5.0|What can I say about this that hasn't already been said?  This album will bludgeon you to death, and then stomp on your brains - and you will love it and go back for more!  I sometimes just laugh when the opening song plays - it is so \\"how the hell did they do that??\\" heavy!  This is doom, sludge, fuzz, and sheer weight.  It's not fast, blast, double-bass and guitar proggy pyrotechnics - it's sludge - pure, evil, thick, smoked out sludge.  Careful how loudly you play it - I could see it blowing speakers, it is SOOO fuzzy and distorted.  I'll end it here, I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.  Buy this, and be careful with it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In love with Christian and Ana and this trilogy!  A true love story with a mixture of erotica! Perfect!  Asked my husband to read them, they are so good!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed it more than the movie. Even though I saw the movie first, it was like I still didn't know what was going to happen.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|parents: im 13 and very capable of knowing not to buy this stuff it warns u before u purchuse it. meaning if ur kid is older than they should be held accountable. its a very fun game i think!! super fun for all ages!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A VERY GOOD READ. I ENJOYED EVERY MIN. I COULD PUT IT DOWN. ESPECIALLY THE ENDING IT WAS THE BEST. I WAS CRYING SO HARD!!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|I ordered these movies for my kids planning on having a movie night with them on the weekend, but they came in the mail the next day!! I am happy and would defiantly order and recommend ordering from here again!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I would have rather watched a few episodes of family guy in the time it took to watch this.  There were a few funny parts, but it was overall pretty disappointing.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I'm thankful that there are new and better action actors but they just can't beat the originals! Stallone was creative back in the day!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book to read for fun!  Great plot that keeps you guessing and has a romantic angle as well!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun game played it today for the first time. Sitting in the dentist it was tons of fun. Good choice.
B0055SWM08|5.0|As casual games go, this app is more than worth the solitary dollar it charges. The premise is very basic: move a drop of water through a maze-like field to collect all the pearls in as few moves as possible while avoiding dangers and obstacles. Featuring many levels, the game offers hours of game play, allowing the player to repeat levels that prove more challenging until a perfect score is achieved. Numerous achievements can be unlocked throughout the many levels, with both easy and difficult trophies to win. The music is soothing and the graphics well-designed and executed. I have this game on both my Kindle and smartphone, and play it often. I also own Quell: Reflect, which I look forward to playing after I've beat all the levels on this one!
B001N3UO68|5.0|This type of movie shows us the reaction of people on what would I do if our plane was held hostage.  We should of kept our shield and be more vigilant we will never forget 9/11.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|FLIGHT is film that belongs in the &#34;airplane disaster&#34; genre of films. In a nutshell, a senior-level airplane pilot has a severe and chronic problem with alcohol, recreational drugs, and hookers. During a routine flight, the plane experiences a mechanical problem which prevents the tail rudder from functioning, and the plane spontaneously dives into a crash mode. Fortunately, the pilot is able to rescue the plane (by flying it upside-down), releases excess fuel into the atmosphere, and skillfully lands it in a grassy field. Most of the film is spent disclosing the pilot's indulgences in alcohol, cocaine, and other sleazy behaviors.<br /><br />The entire film is a journey to a destination that takes the form of a plus/minus choices. An example of the plus/minus choices are: (1) Should the pilot be held responsible for the crash and for the few passenger deaths, because of his unique alcoholism and recreational drug activities with the consequent loss of control of the craft, or (2) Should the pilot be lauded as a hero, because of his astonishing skill in maintaining control of the airplane during the mechanical failure, and because of the fact that he prevented the deaths of dozens of passengers? The surprise ending is that the destination of the movie is located in a legal &#34;gray area.&#34; (Don't worry, I do not tell how the story ends.)<br /><br />TECHNICAL ASPECTS. The technical aspect of the film is based on a real event, namely, Alaska Airlines flight 261. In flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft experienced a fatal accident on January 31, 2000 over the Pacific Ocean about 2.7 miles north of Anacapa Island, California. The two pilots and 83 passengers on board were killed.<br />The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the cause was a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system screw assembly's acme nut threads. Towards the end of the movie (Flight), the viewingaudience watches a federal inquest as to the causes of the crash, and the viewing audience learns that the failure was due to excess wearing of the same screw assembly.<br /><br />OPENING MOMENTS. The opening moments of the movie will come as a surprise. The viewer will be treated to an abundance of mammary footage and gluteal footage of Denzel Washington's drug addict girlfriend. I was wondering if we were going to see naked footage of Mr.Washington, but fortunately the viewer is spared. In the opening minutes, we also see Mr.Washington snorting cocaine, we see bag of marijuana, and we see the girlfriend injecting heroin. Now the question that arises is, whether adult viewers will have a stomach for this sort of thing. Certainly, male viewers will welcome the excellent anatomy of the female actress. However, the nude scenes, and the drug scenes, seemed to me, to be X-rated material. At any rate, this is the only nudity that occurs in the film, and the nudity is similar to that shown in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, when we see Dustin Hoffman's girlfriend. It is my opinion that the material is suitable for children, but only for the age of 12 and over. Younger kids will likely respond with bad dreams. In my opinion, this film is an excellent teaching device for kids of the age of 12 and up, since it provides a case history of alcoholism and addiction. The film does NOT include any Sam Pekinpah-style violence. However, parents who have made up their minds that their children should NOT see nude scenes and should NOT be exposed to scenes of alcoholism and drugs, should refrain from buying the DVD.<br /><br />TENOR OF THE FILM. The film provides a guided tour of some of the gray areas of life. During the flight, the young copilot is alarmed by Mr.Washington's bizarre activities in the cockpit, e.g., his behavior in pretending that the oxygen mask is a recreational drug that is to be inhaled. And so the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the naive young copilot, or of not making any committed decision at this point. While on the ground, Mr.Washington tries to become reacquainted with his son, who lives with the divorced mother, and who is totally alienated from his father. And so, the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the son's decision to cut of ties with the father, or to favor Mr.Washington's attempts at reconciliation. As the plot matures, Mr.Washington's girlfriend takes him to an alcoholics anonymous (AA) meeting, but Mr.Washington resists the hackneyed preaching of the meeting leader, and excuses himself from the meeting. And so, the viewing audience is given the choice of deciding that Mr.Washington is a lost cause, as far as his alcoholism is concerned, or of maintaining some belief that Mr.Washington will be able to reform himself eventually. For your information, it is the case that up to the very last minutes of the film, Mr.Washington continues to snort cocaine and to drink hard liquor. Another gray area is that blood samples were withdrawn from the entire crew and passengers, as well as from the dead crash victims. The result was that Mr.Washington's blood tested positive for cocaine and alcohol. The relevant gray areas (or sources of ambiguity) are as follows. The equipment from the clinical testing laboratory was not calibrated thereby leading to doubt of the validity of the lab results, and leading to the airlines officials successful sealing Mr.Washington's laboratory results, thereby preventing the positive results from being disclosed during the federal inquest. The gray area is, therefore, were the lab results really incorrect, or were they valid, in showing Mr.Washington's high alcohol and drug levels.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS. The crash landing scene is a work of art. After flying the airplane upside-down for several minutes, Mr.Washington rights the airplane, approaches a grassy meadow. One of the wingtips slices through a church steeple, causing parishioners to scatter, and wesee the plane twisting and buckling as it lands in the field, in a dramatic manner that recalls the drama of the whaling scenes in MOBY DICK, starring Gregory Peck. Another special effect (though a low tech special effect) occurs when Mr.Washington is in a hotel room at night, waiting to meet government officials the next day. During the night, the door to the next suite, accidently left unlocked, invitingly bangs against the door latch, due to the evening wind, puffing into the adjoining hotel suite. Mr.Washington rises, walks through the door to the next suite, and stands before the open window. This is a great suspensful moment, achieved with zero expense, aside from the need for one of the film crew to jar the door a few times (thus simulating the wind). The suspense of this scene continues, when Mr.Washington spots the hotel fridge and opens it, revealing dozens of bottles of liquor and beer. Mr.Washington takes out one of the liquor bottles, and the movie camera focuses upon it closely, and the 4 inch high liquor bottle takes up the entire screen. Suspense comes, because the audience will wonder if Mr.Washington will open the bottle, or if he will resist to temptation (and decidedly turn a new leaf before his meeting the next day with airline officials who are investigating the crash).<br /><br />CONCLUSION. The film is one of the most intelligent films to come out of Hollywood. The film is similar to another movie starring Denzel Washington, namely, CRIMSON TIDE. CRIMSON TIDE also featured a government inquest, this one involving a submarine, and the issue of firing nuclear weapons. The journey of this movie navigates through the black and white territory involving the question of who behaved correctly, Denzel Washington or Gene Hackman. But unexpectedly, at the last moment, the plot line of CRIMSON TIDE takes an unexpected turn, and navigates away from the black and white area, and concludes in a harbor known as the &#34;gray area.&#34; FLIGHT also takes a similar unexpected turn at the conclusion of the film. FIVE STARS.
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|I would like to see the ability to zoom into the moon and perhaps lables of locations could appear. Would be great
B0098460O4|4.0|When the national news bought these Youngester to our attention, I fell in love with them.<br />Since they came in second, I was hoping someone would make a Cd with them. My only draw back<br />is they should have made more compemptary music than what they did. But I love it anyway
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I bought my black Friday vita for this game I almost just picked up the original but the additions were too much for me to overlook the port. Now hopefully Sony will get some other games out for the PSV.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Super fun and addictive!  Not only do I love this game but my 6 year old daughter also loves to play it.
B0086700CM|3.0|well as you see temple run is a very fun game but as ive played temple run ive starts to lagg so I'm not very happy and if you can fix that I would love the game. oh yeah one more thing when I got the football player acouple days later I opened the game and he was just earased so I got super mad cause I was working or known as playing all night to get him and bam done
B000OLGCI4|4.0|My granddaughter loved this movie, so I had to buy it for her daughter, who is now three.  Fond memories watching it again.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I am not a woman who enjoys reading anything with graphic violence, but the storytelling in this book is so intricately-woven and compelling that I continued to read on long after I normally would have stopped. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|How amazing different translations all at the reach of one click! If you enjoy learning more about the word this tool is just for you.
B004132I20|5.0|never watched this when it was on tv because i didnt think sherlock would translate well to modern times. i was wrong 5 out of 5 stars. doesnt look like they are doing anymore  after season 2 i hope im wrong again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game every day no matter were I am on my computer.  Love to play on my Kindle so I do not have to wait till I get home to play.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|First two are epic, and the third movie was average.  However, 19.99 for three Blu Rays is simply awesome.<br />Thanks
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I spend more of my day on facebook than any other thing I do.  Thank you for the access to my family and friends that are spread all over the country.  I love the games.  Seniors need friends and when limited to travel this is a great way to still enjoy life.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Addicted to Eva and Gideon can't wait for more!  Nothing like fifty shades. Going to take a lot of work to find a new read that makes me want more like Reflected in you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really great game. Really simple to play and yet challenging. A good way for developing an algorithmic way of thinking.
B007UXT6T6|1.0|WHO DO I CONTACT TO MAKE THIS WORK??  I'VE TRIED AND TRIED BUT ALL YOU WANT TO HELP ME WITH IS HOW TO DOWNLOAD TO MY KINDLE FIRE.  I DON'T OWN ONE!!!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Works great with my new Kindle Fire.  Protects as well as looks attractive!  Still learning all the features of my new Kindle!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I never watched the series prior to this purchase, so I took a chance buying it. It's amazing. The acting is incredible and the writing is nearly flawless. I can't say enough good things about this series.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|It was simple to put the Kindle into this case. The cover makes a great prop for support in different positions
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|The Hobbit was my favorite Tolkein book, and I was so excited to see the movie when it came out. Listening to this soundtrack puts me right back in the theater, which is why I listen to it regularly.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I Loved this game very realistic and A GOOD IDEA don't get  the 2nd addition it sucks my cousin got it
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I heard of Lianne only a few weeks ago, but I fell in love with her style/sound. I bought this as a gift, so I haven't listened to the whole album yet, but I intend to pick up a copy for myself. Of the songs I've heard, she has a lighter, upbeat jazz sound to her songs.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was amazing in fact so amazing I read the whole thing in a day.I love this book a lot.I hope there are more to be published!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I'm a fan of American history, especially the controversial kind. I know that some of this was glorified, but the series does a great job of highlighting some major moral conflicts with John Adams (representing the Boston Massacre British Redcoats).
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I finished this book in one sitting, and ok l loved it. The plot was very thick and the characters were very lively. I had s ok much suspicion over every little thing that happened! A must read.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I had never seen this before I bought it, so I was taking a chance with this purchase. I was NOT disappointed. If you're into prohibition-era gangsters, this is a must-have.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down, what an amazing book. Defiantly one of my favorites of Nicholas sparks.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|There's not much I can say that you wouldn't already know. Just buy it. It's one of the better Marvel movies.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never felt so emotionally attached to both the protagonists. I cried a lot. But I loved how you can really build a relationship with the characters as if they were real. But they are real, in our hearts. I look forward to being a part of John Green 's fan base
B005LAII12|5.0|Look at the review title. That's all you need to know. It's a great adult comedy that actually has a decent message. I'd recommend it to anyone who's not easily offended. Even though it's by Seth MacFarlane, it's not over-the-top like Family Guy tends to be.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am 16 and this book is very relatable. It was an enjoyable book that provided me moments of great happiness.
1442359315|4.0|I bought this for my mom, and I probably would never read it or listen to it. That being said, if you have someone in your life who is religious/spiritual, I guess I'd recommend it as my mom was very excited to receive it. If nothing else, it made a great gift.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've always enjoyed the Pendergast novels.  This one is one of the better ones of the series.  Can't wait for the next one.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|It's not my favorite Pixar movie by far, but it's definitely not the worst (I'm looking at you, Cars 2). It didn't feel as creative as Pixar's other movies, but it was still entertaining. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys Pixar movies.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|As many others have observed, the packaging is VERY cheap.  Parts of the plastic trays were broken in shipping.  They will NOT hold up over time, being too fragile even for normal use.<br /><br />The package contained two duplicate disks for one season while missing another disk.  The disks themselves seem to be of poor quality, with several being either unplayable, or problematic.<br /><br />Overall, poor quality in both media production and packaging.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|I'm not crazy about it, but I felt the need to be up to date on the better superhero movie franchises, and Iron Man is definitely one of the better ones. At least it's not Daredevil (or Elektra, or Fantastic 4, or Spiderman 3, or The Hulk, or The Green Lantern...I could go on, but I think you get my point).
B00961ZESW|4.0|The whole album is cute, just like &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34;. She has that sweet heliumy voice expected in bubblegum music. My 3 year old likes it too!
B002M3UEP4|5.0|When I saw an AMV of this movie I just had to buy it. When I watched the movie I almost shed a tear because of the family that stuck together thrughout the movie. My only wish for this movie is more (and/or longer) King Kazma battles.<br /><br />Never a dull moment in this movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to read the last book of the trilogy.  Sad that there's not  more.  Now to wait for the movie.
0385535147|5.0|I read all of John Grisham's books.  This one was really good and I couldn't put it down.  It turns out different than you think it will be.
B007N85POS|5.0|Easy to play and it's enjoyable for &#34;kids&#34; of all ages!  Would recommend for anyone who likes Angry Birds. Happy Holidays...
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My grandson's talked me into getting this game.  It was the day after Christmas and I asked which game I should get for my new kindle.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Fun Movie with great stunts and story. Looking forward to part two which is suppose to come out in mid 2013.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this book for my son who is almost 6.  It's Dr. Seuss's last book he published before his death and it is definitely full of wisdom from one of the greats.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I felt like I could really relate to the book. Even though it never said where the main character lived or to whom he was writing the letters to, there was a sense if connection.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|I should have read the reviews first. The pieces do not stack like they should.. Not even close. Very disappointing.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Give this game a try, pretty entertaining and fun. Not too difficult but not too easy either. Graphics are nice too.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This was the best game I've ever gotten.  Draw a stickman epic is epic!  It's so challenging and it really puts your brain to the task.  Definitely worth the money.  Ever since I got this game I've been talking about nothing else.  BEST GAME EVER!!!!!
0399160450|4.0|Keep on working on it, JR,Jr. may amount to a better character at some point, but definitely not Jack Ryan-esque yet! Plot and story were better than the last two Junior books!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I don't know what all the negative reviews are about. I own the kinect version for xbox 360 and they are about the same besides this being less tiring. There are no ads that I have seen. Very fun and worth the money. Seems better than the Google Play version.
141659521X|4.0|Vince Flynn, just keep them coming! Great Christmas present for someone who likes the author!!! Mitch Rapp is at his best!
B000I0QL82|5.0|I think this is the best Christmas movie made.  It is the 1st movie where White Christmas was performed.  Who can resist Bing Crosby & Fred Astaire?  Of course, Bing gets the girl in the end!
0470913029|5.0|No complaints since this shipped and arrived on time, as per the email confirmation regarding its ETS. Couldn't ask for anything more.
B00846REIS|3.0|It was a good read, but It was too similar to fifty shades in the most annoying ways. This book was written better,more descriptive, more sexual and disturbing which I really liked which in turn I will be interested in where the next book will take them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If it wasn't so exspensive I would have it on all of my devices. other than that, the game is the BEST. LOVE THE GAAAAAAAME
B0082SU98U|4.0|A wonderful heartwarming children's story.  Perfect for every little girl in every corner of the world.  I would recommend this to all 5-7 grade students.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The near death experience happens with greater frequency as technology blurs the barrier between life and death. All that is really needed is a credible witness. Who more credible than an neurosurgeon? Though this book is written well, I give it only 4 stars, simply because it reads like it was written by a scientist, which I take to mean, it is even more authentic. I got a great deal out of reading it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good....easy read. The ending through unfair to the reader, leaves me yearning for more! I look forward to reading the following books.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|It was such a cute story & a great family movie! We chose it without knowing much about it & we are very happy with our purchase. We have had many family members borrow it already!
B00899E5B4|5.0|Glad this guys still around. I've always liked his sense of humor. He seems like a down to earth kinda guy. This album grows on you pretty quick!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not quite as powerful as book one but a well written story. Leaves you hanging for book three. Much like other trilogies.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This was always an awesome show.  Sorry its done. It was my look forward to night for TV Great Purchase.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Till you sing one more, Beneath a moonless sky, Love never dies, Beauty underneath, Devil take the hindmost, Look with your heart....<br />Andrew Lloyd Webber, you are a MASTER.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Great to hear a select group of Toby Keiths finest work.  They are all good.  Vintage Toby with more to come.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|= Amazing day watching Andrew' masterpieces.<br />If you love POTO, but this, you won't be dissapointed.<br />And I love the sequel too, but you know, the sequel is just Webber' vision of the story (Phantom & Christine romance), so watch with a free mentality.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has a voice that is monumental.  It really can produce any let alone the best of these stage songs and the pairing with others blends well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect for my new kindle fire!<br /><br />Easy to navigate and learn, while reminding me of the classic Windows version still.
1451696191|5.0|This book was not what I expected! It was an amazing book and I highly recommend it. It changed my life and the way I think of things.
B002L6I9Z4|3.0|We gave this camera to our son (almost 3) as a Christmas gift. He loves taking pictures on my camera, but I was always worried he was going to drop and break it. The flash is really really bright. the quality of the photos are not great, but it works for my son (I think he enjoys the act of taking pics more than a picture itself). He enjoys using this camera, and this keeps his hands off my camera!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoy Child's writing style and suspense.  Always adding the unexpected. I will order more of Childs books in the future.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I absolutely love the book and musical, and this soundtrack does the franchise justice! The cast recordings are so amazing and well done. :)
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love pac man always have. I when I saw I could get it on my Kindle I was all over it. Now I need to find the old Frogger game as well.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|The recipients of this gift item loved the movie.  After visiting the actual bridges in Madison County, IA, this fall the movie scenes are more real.
B001706I5I|5.0|Renting movies off of Amazon has yet to fail me. They stream fast and little to none interruptions that Netflix and iTunes have.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very Great book<br />Very fast read and I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next book!
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|She is very artistic and loves legos but seldom receives them.  The will be a  very small challenge for her.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My grandson is 3 months old and just loves this.  Out of the many toys we got for his car seat this is the one that he likes the best!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I did not mean to download this game.  I was trying to learn how to use the Amazon App on my tablet.  It was only 99 cents plus tax so I was not upset.  Turns out it was not a wasted purchase, my daughter (age 9) says it is really fun.  I have not played it myself but if it can entertain a 9 year old it must have something going on, Ha.
B00009YOQW|5.0|Purchased this for my grandson for Christmas and it is a hit.  He loves it and I love it.  Would recommend this.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|How on Earth did this movie get such high ratings??<br /><br />It's slower than a snail in molasses and nothing major ever even comes of it. This movie is a Lifetime level movie, but I was forced to buy it instead of rent it through Amazon.<br /><br />I wish I could get my $6 and those wasted 90 minutes of my life back, and invest it in watching a can of paint dry instead.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I just got my Kindle Fire for Christmas and this game was my very first App.  I am enjoying it very much.  For a freebie it offers a high degree of sophistication and gameplay options.  I recommend it highly.
B007T9FRFS|5.0|Fast moving action,. This is a great summer read, even if it isn't summer................. Looking forward to future books from this author...
B0041D843M|5.0|Everything in this book makes sense.  My eyes are wide open to the society we live in.  I really hope there will be more people like Dr. Campbell to fight for this valuable information to be taught and practiced in our schools and medical communities.  It's not difficult to understand.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this app in my kindle and I can't stop playing. It works very well and I have had no problems so far.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Will we ever get tired of this sitcom?  Probably not!!!  New great material! Old relationships, new relationships, renewed relationships.  (Amy and Sheldon are the perfect pair)  I would highly recommend to all of those nerdy geeky members in your family.  Especially, the ones with a sense of humor!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It's cool but if you open other apps after you close the game and don't play it for awhile you have to start all over please fix it
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very fun and a highly addictive game.  I would definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a challenging, but fun game.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is a good game makes you think good graphics. Hints stop you from getting stuck too .wish the free version was longer.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  It can be a challenge, but that is what makes it so great...can't wait to get to the next level.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a rollercoaster of emotion. I am truly looking forward to the second book to see what unfolds between Ana and Christian
B00ARAO720|3.0|Met expectations, based on trailers. Predictable plot. Story did not lend itself to deep character development. Blah, blah, blah, blah
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Why do you have to not have the words and I think that you should tell us what happened when he ate the cheese after they finish school.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome app to develop a rapid response, it's like your brain is connecting the dots even before you put your finger on the screen. It's definitely a must have on your tablet =).
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I like being able to draw with the different colors.  There are stickers to add and different designs. It's my favorite.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Have no idea how this camera works . I bought it Dec 26 and have yet to receive the download.  Guess a nasty phone call to customer service is in my near future.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Recent and cool movies.Like the resume feature.Also the buy or rent (pricing)feature is a plus.Have not used the search yet.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Having read other of his novels, I marvel at Grisham's ability to keep the reader a little off balance in guessing outcomes. He fully fleshes out the characters in a way that adds to the reader's interest in them all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've had this for about a year and have lost 20 lbs.  this is a great beginner workout and with the 3levels progresses with you.  I go back to this often for a quick workout when I'm in a time crunch.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|These guns are always a hit with both father and son.  They have one of every model and do battle daily.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This is better than I expected.  I like the retro look and feel of this game.  It is fun to play and easy to get used to the controls (even the tilt to steer).  If you used to feed such old arcade games as pole position and other driving games quarters you should get your money's worth out of this one.  Recommended.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Very strange story. I regret buying but it was my first book download so I read anyway.  I like  life stories
B000002MY3|5.0|I really liked this album.  Her lyrics are incredibly powerful and filled with emotion.  I suppose that a serious fan would know the origin of some of what she sings about, but as a simple lover of fun music, I like what she brings and she definitely brings it.  I can't imagine any performer who stormed the building and overpowered the amplifiers with her truly soulful deliveries of some of the most powerful statements ever made by a female artist.  One can sense that she holds nothing back and that she is alive in the world of chaos and wears her heart on her sleeve while being strong yet vulnerable to the same emotions, dreams and desires we all share.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My friends get mad at me for playing this game so much! I love this game so much I would give it a billion stars! Absolutely, positivly get this app if you haven't already! :-)
B000F3AB0Q|4.0|So, if you don't already know who Gary Moore is, I'm not the best resource.  I can only share my relatively uninformed opinion.  I just don't have the bandwidth to research the artists I listen to...<br /><br />My impression of GM is that he's an accomplished and skilled guitarist in a &#34;junior Ritchie Blackmore&#34; kind of way, which I'm certain does (would) not impress Moore.  I'm not a real big fan of his vocal talents.  He seems to get by okay, but it seems a bit of a struggle.  He seems to have to labor through the songs rather than having them flow naturally from him the way the &#34;truly great&#34; ones do.  At least for that reason I'm impressed with Moore's talents, even if not smitten.<br /><br />Now that he's gone, it easier to think of Moore in fonder terms, but he is first a really solid guitarist.  He isn't on my short-list of front-men.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its nice to see a game the kids and i enjoy equally. the game makes you think and ea level challenges you.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Spider Solitaire is my favorite go to game. It is addicting. Played it  many times , but only on the second level.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I had a great time with my 20 year old daughter watching this, her favorite Christmas movie, on Christmas night. I'm not a Will Ferrel fan but if it makes my daughter happy, I'm happy.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I hadn't read this author before.  A good friend of mine recommended the book, and boy was he right.  The story grabbed me from the beginning and held my attention!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app it is so so so fun!!!!!!!! It is complicated but so so so fun I highly recommend it
0316078913|5.0|It was a little out of season to read David Sedaris', \\"Holidays on Ice\\", in May, but I had to push through it, because I am seeing him speak at UCLA tomorrow night! Even out of season, this was another fantastic collection of Sedaris essays. One of my favorites was \\"Santaland Dairies\\", where Sedaris describes the ins and outs of working as an Elf at a department store during the Christmas season. It actually reminded me a lot of working as a ride operator at Universal Studios, a lot of pushing groups of people through an attraction, while keeping a smile and getting those numbers up! My absolute favorite story is the one of the students in a foreign language class trying to explain the concept of Easter. Easter becomes very complicated and absolutely hilarious.
0547338023|3.0|This has been my favorite book since I was a young woman and I am now in my late 60's so I have been reading it for over 40 years.  I did not like the graphic pictures because they were crude and unrefined.  I purchased the book to give to my granddaughters and I did with hesitation because of the graphics.
B007RTAR64|5.0|this doll is well constructed didn't seem cheap at all.  It came with a stand and elbows and knees are posable.  It is a very pretty doll, the costume was realistic and high quality.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read this many years ago..I wanted to reread it, so I purchased the kindle edition..still an amazing read<br />sad
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read! couldn't put it down. Only disappointment is that the third book isn't coming out til May of 2913
B007SGM084|5.0|The friends were all talking about it, so I had to get in on it.  Glad I did. The first book sucked me in, the second book was ok, but I was glad I hung in there for the third. If you like erotic fiction, you will enjoy this book. I didn't feel it was worth all the controversy, and I come from a very conservative background.  It's fiction!
1594203334|5.0|Blunt and funny, but a good book to read about different prespectives on parenting. People should consider that this is for a middle-upper class when reading, and not take the jokes personally. I loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is another great dystopian book.  Had no idea when a friend suggested it for our book club. What I really enjoyed was the ability to easily read and pick it up later and remember exactly where I had left off. To me the characters were memorable and the description of the setting and on goings were easy to follow. Few main characters, so that made it easy too. This was a great book, and I think you will like it too! The ending was a little disappointing, which is why I've heard there are more!
1938469003|4.0|Finally, a great &#34;style&#34; beer book.  This one is loaded with plenty of content and a lot of great recipes for those budding homebrewers to try out.  This is definately a great value, especially compared to many other the other style-oriented brewing books on the market.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Quality of DVD great Awesome series.Bought this for a gift for my mother and she loved it.Highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys the elegant and classy movies
1938469011|5.0|Say what you will, this is a must-have for the pro, semi-pro and amateur want-to-be pro home brewer.  Lots of easy reading and lots of technicals to spin your brain on.  At this price point, I don't see why every level of brewer doesn't have it or order it immediately.  The reference section is extremly complete, but none-the-less, will soon be out of date given the high level of activity in the area of hop growing.  Fortunately, the family of hops allows people to get back to center and understand the slight variances between strains, similarities, and differences.  All we need now is a really excellent book on grains and the entire spectrum of brewing will be complete.  Get on it, Stan!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is such an adorable game. the pets are so cute and very fun to take care of them by washing, playing or feeding them. and this game isn't just for young kids but also for teenagers and adaults. you can make your own city full of the most adorablest pets you could ever see. this game also includes real types of pet breeds like the Boston Terriers or Persian Cats. this game also lets you talk to friends or play with other people. I have had this game for about two weeks and I have not had any soical problems. lets keep that up! this game deserves five stars. I love it so much.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|This is a fantastic mystery/action show. Can't wait to see what mischief the characters get into next week! Let me bow to Queen Victoria!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a game for both boys and girls of all different ages. me and my brother really enjoy the cute ponies and how u can take care of them by feeding, bathing and playing with them. I'm still on level eight and enjoying the game. sometimes I get to open different levels. I hope a lot of people buy this game. I hope everybody loves this game!!! YOURS TRULY, KITTYLOVER :-) (-:
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We started with the Perplexus for our kids and I got this for my husband - it's been fun for kids and grown ups
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody's voice and lyrics are stunning.  She is one of the most talented young jazz/blues artists in the world.  I hope to hear her in concert one day.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The usage thus far is good. Just received a few days ago; however am looking forward to using it on a daily basis
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Not at all happy with this, but maybe it's just me. I expected to be able to point and shoot, but it's backwards and very awkward to use if you don't want to use mirror image. Truthfully, I haven't played with it enough. At the onset, though, not really happy with this app.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I bought the Kindle for my grandchild along with this case. He loves the Kindle and said the case fits perfectly.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought this was a great read. It is sweet & funny. I would recommend it to those who want a light read.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|This cover is very sturdy and the stand works fine.  I like the magnetized closer too.  A good buy it is.
B0063IH60K|4.0|runs smoothly on kindle firehd. iwish it had different  levelz. i cant wait for keyboard  typingwill beeasier..i apologizefor this  review
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addictive!! so fun and awesome!!!! :) I have it on my kindle fire and its so awesome
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I think the movie was great and had great acting. Christopher Nolan did some great directing, top of the notch. But like some reviews have said, it felt rushed in some parts and unexplainable in some areas. Why does Batman take a whole 8 years off? Why does he have such a bad limp and messed up knee? He's had 8 years to heal and have surgeries and gadgets to make it feel better?  Anne Hathaway did a good performance too, more than I initially thought she was going to do. However, I believe that she could have had a bigger and wider part and impact in the movie. I saw the chemistry and what not between Selina and Bruce, however it was quick and short. I also understand why Nolan decided not to mention The Joker out of respect to Heath Ledger, however I believe that he should have been mentioned at least once. A lot of what was happening and how Gotham City is comes from what The Joker did in The Dark Knight. No way in hell that every criminal is behind bars and what not. Bane was an admirable villain to Batman, short of the performance of The Joker's, however he did the part very well. Talia had an impact of the movie of course, but why so quick though? I'm not going to detail every single part of the movie, you can watch it for yourself and decide. But like I said, great movie, not the best in the trilogy, maybe the worst of them. But not saying that it's a bad movie, not by far. Just the worst of the 3 that Nolan made. You decide how you think the movie is compared to the 3. I'll keep watching all 3 of them over and over. Great storytelling and directing by Nolan.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my dad after we subscribed to the HBO channel and he hadn't seen the first or second season. So far so good!
B002JVWR4K|5.0|It's intelligent fun! I introduced my wife to the series (only been married two years) and she would have never watched it if I had not. She loves it!
B000L212HC|5.0|As a huge Christian bale fan I had to have this movie when I saw that it was on sale for Cyber Monday. I definitely recommend it for movie- lovers in general.
0671449028|5.0|A good, fun way to get them ready for bed.  It's a favorite in my family -- we end by rocking back and forth as we read &#34;and they rock, and rock and rock to sleep&#34;.  Highly recommended.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Excellent movie. This a good example how to make a great movie out of simple topic. The key great three actors.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|This was a great quick read...a friend mentioned if to me so I figured I'd check it out....I've read other similar stories, i liked it, really makes you think.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Coehlo's writing is  amazing. This is one of the books where you can get so many citable quotes for nice  and inspiring thoughts about life.  My sicologist recommended it to me . I am glad he did. I really enjoyed it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This still is the best holiday movie ever.  I cry at the last scene every time I watch. Clarence the angel is great.
B009329Y30|3.0|As usual,  I read the book before watching the movie , and the book is much better. Zac Effron was not the actor for this role. When I read the book I had a different image of the main character.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Love Kathy Reich's and enjoy getting lost in the scientific world of Temperance and Detective Ryan. Great mystery with a lot of twists. Couldn't put it down.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Excellent movie! Have wanted a copy for my collection for a very long time. Have often recommended it, now I can show it to guests at our home.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Loads of fun for all family members. Very engaging. Great storyline. My kids absolutely love it. Well worth the price of admission.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is so cute I'm gonna die!!! One of those movies I beg the kids to watch. Not annoying and charmingly adorable
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was very good and the story was very funny. I love all the diary of the wimpy kid books,<br /><br />I love how it begins.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Going in, I could only name about four songs that the Killers sang.  I bought the blu ray concert because I read the audio and video were top notch.  I wasn't disappointed.  The last song, When You Were Young, by itself, is worth the price of admission.  Incredible performance in an amazing  concert hall.  The DTS audio is clean enough to enjoy at concert-like volume and makes it easy to believe you are actually there in person.  What are you waiting on?  Add this to your collection, you won't be sorry.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game although I have to rely in the hint button to navigate the town. The hidden puzzle scenes are absolutely stunning and a bit challenging at times. I have found myself saying, on more than one occasion after hitting the hint button, &quot; I never would've found that!&quot; Overall a great game.
0345803507|2.0|The ending of the book giving another view from Grey`s perspective of meeting Ana at the beginning takes away from the book`s  &#34;feel good ending&#34;
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Initially, I found the backstory a bit florid and overdone.  However, as I got further into the book, I understood the reasons for the embellishment of the history of how the story came about.  Pi is revealed as extremely precocious and very courageous and ingenious in his dealings with the other inhabitants of the lifeboat.  I became totally engrossed in the book, reading it on my phone and iPad at every opportunity.  I highly recommend it to adult readers.
0345803493|4.0|This book had alot more story line to it and alittle less &#34;trash&#34;. It gave more excitement to it other than the sexual bouts.
1400069289|4.0|The Power of Habit is the latest in the psychology/self-help/business sub-genre made popular by Malcolm Gladwell and others. What sets The Power of Habit apart is that Duhigg has filled the book with tips on how to apply its lessons to real-world situations. Although the book explores the high-level concepts and theories that support its thesis, it does not dwell on these ideas. Instead, it conveys only the information necessary to move the arguments forward. After reading the book, you'll have a good idea about how to address any habit or routine that you want to change. With New Year's resolutions coming up, this is sure to be helpful information for many readers.<br /><br />That said, the book sometimes overstates its case. For example, Duhigg discusses Paul O'Neill's tenure in government and his efforts to uncover the root cause of infant mortality. O'Neill ultimately discovers that nutrition education is key to improving maternal health and reducing childhood disease and death. Duhigg then states that since O'Neill began exploring this issue, infant mortality has fallen dramatically. However, he presents no information connecting O'Neill in any way to this decline.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It's a quick read that never gets stuck in the weeds. After you finish, you'll feel ready and able to tackle any habit that you want to change.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Good follow up to number one. Ends suddenly at a strange place. Clear path for number three. Seems like it is worth reading on. Can't forget the books are meant for teenagers!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Amazing book just wanted to keep reading. Very detailed and true to life, even with such a dark story line you just kept pulling and feeling for Sky and Holder.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun - fun - fun!!!  If you like Angry Birds Space you'll love this one, it's a combination of both.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have tried other weather apps and The Weather Channel is by far the easiest to use both when I'm home and when we're traveling. I especially like being able to look up weather for current conditions as well as 10 days in the future and the ease of navigating from one location to another to look at weather for our road trip destinations.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|I chose this star rating, because as great as the actual DVD is, and as easy as it was to order/receive the product, DVD #2, on at least 2 of the episodes has skipped.  When I rewound the DVD to try and watch the scene again, nothing changed; I actually missed, in total, 3 scenes on DVD #2.  I know in the grand scheme of things that that is not too terrible, however, when I purchase something, i want it to be 100%.  I know nothing can be guaranteed to be 100% functioning (like if you get a DVD at a RedBox, or whatever other DVD service one uses), but still, it would have been better if there had been no problems.<br />Other than that, great service, website and the gift was a hit for all!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Lots of layouts, but I wish there were tile options. I had a hard time at first decerning the nuances between tiles. I stuck with it and now enjoy this game often.  A stylus may be helpful for large fingers.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Everything is good so far - good acting, good directing, good camera work. I want to see more. Will recommend to my friend.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Failed to even finish this book.  Was dissappointed when I saw that my daughter had downloaded the next book because I ended up wasting my money on two!
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I tought this would be fun to us on my kindle but I dont have a camera on my kindle fire so it didn't allow me to take any pictures!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love this movie so much, I have rented it 2 times already and cant get enough of it. Great acting for the most part, but the music is what keeps me coming back for more! A definite must see!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great series, about our home planet. After watching this series I gained even a greater respect for this planet then before. I would highly recommend this to anyone and very kid friendly. Five Star Pick!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|The DVD was exactly what I wanted and shipped to me very quickly. I am very pleased with my purchase.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My son enjoys this greatly.  It was a Christmas present, and we had to mix and create the colors for the band already.
0395389496|5.0|The recommendation of buying the book made me want to purchase it. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Great book.
B006O3MU96|4.0|This game is fun for my 6 year old daughter. very simple game... but she seems to like it. Cool.
034580404X|5.0|Bought these for a gift for someone.I received them in a timely fashion and they were packed and perfect.Person loved the gift!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a great way to pass the time. Easy to play and great options for the card backs and screen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Simple, clean narrative style leaves room for vivid settings and characters that I care about. I saw the movie first, which was enjoyable enough, but friends insisted that the book was superior, and they were right. I am now hooked in a way that I never could get into with, say, the Harry Potter series, which apparently also caught an adult market. It's fun to take a break from heavier reading for a change, if only to be able to remember what it was like to relax and immerse myself into a whole other world like I could when I was ten.  I especially appreciate a resourceful, capable heroine who kicks serious butt, something that was in short supply when I was growing up as a young girl in the seventies.
B004FOA84A|2.0|I enjoyed the game while it lasted, but had completed the entire game in less than 2 hours. I was very disappointed to finish a game I'd paid for so quickly.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very meaningful and well written. Charlie's character is a interesting and relatable. In fact all the characters are interesting, and relatable. Just fantastic.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love love love love love love love love this movie! thank you so much! no problems with it at all! :))
B009EEUD00|5.0|Re enjoyed this classic recently. Upgraded my 5.1 speakers and was shocked as to all the new stuff I'd  never heard before. I'd always loved the movie for itself,  but I never realised how excellent the sound production was. When the old man shoots the cow,  it made me jump back! Or when Pedros cousins pulled up on their car,  I could hear the little nuances of the engine and it felt like the car was in my living room. All this from streaming video no les . All in all,  REALLY re enjoyed this.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|In plain speak, a tremendous account of why we owe so much to those who protect us. I cannot find the words to give the honor to these men and would never embarrass them by trying.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|has all the films and at a great price!! cant beat it..and on blu-ray how can you go wrong!! Love holiday prices
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Saw the movie first but enjoy the book much better! It brings much better imagery and creates a stunning world.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Tired of reading the same old story from the first two books. I haven't even been able to finish it. Still half way through it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a good book and managed to keep my attention the whole entire time. I thought it was an excellent addition to the trilogy.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|As a fan of Tony Bourdain's show \\"No Reservations\\", I expected to like this book.  I was not disappointed. After the first day of reading I tried out his simple fish recipe to rave reviews and am now doomed to spend the next month of my free time trying everything else.  His stories of kitchen comradery and the battle of the crew against the customers bring back fond memories of summers spent in kitchens around New York.  Infinitely interesting and easily inspiring this is a great read for any foodie, weekend kitchen warrior, and former or future food service industry lemming.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. I can spend hours playing.  Free and fun! I recommend it to anyone!
B003IDMUT0|5.0|John Grisham did not disappoint, I thought it was a great read although a bit slowat times.  Not enough however to keep me glued to the end and wished it would go on longer. I would thoroughly recommend it.
030759565X|5.0|The commentary is great - real down to earth and easy to relate to.  Her photos are amazing and the recipes are easy to recreate and delicious to eat - my favorite cook book of the year!
0380807343|4.0|I had given this book to a young person after their remarking that they enjoyed the movie adaptation. Although they seemed to have taken an interest in the book I cannot help but think they were disappointed to find that there are many differences between the two mediums.
0307951529|3.0|It was a little harder to get through than I expected. I kept waiting for the examples to get really tactical and inspiring but kept feeling like it was a swing and a miss for me. I'll probably try it again and see if the second go provides deeper insight and inspiration.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I purchased this album for my wife and she seems to have enjoyed it very much. She says that it is very musical.
B0086700CM|2.0|subway surfers is so much better than temple run. subway surfers has a christmas setting and temple run doesnt. so i reccomend deleting temple run if u hav it and download subway surfers if u dont hav it.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|this movie was not the best in the series of Batman films.  Some cool features and gadgets in the movie, but otherwise, everything was just ok.  Catwoman made a relatively boring appearance.  just not impressed overall.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book! It def kept my interest and I finished it quickly. I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Easy download and a good movie. Loved watching it on my new kindle fire HD on the plane ride home.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a perfect easy to use basic calculator for kindle fire hd.  there have been no bugs that I have seen and I am very happy with this app.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Over good app, I use this app daily on my commute yo office to office to listen to AM radio.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|so I check for the free app of the day almost every day. and so I found one today so of course I look at it and check reviews and stuff like that and I liked what I saw.......but...........in the pics(and the game)it is egxactly what I played on this game on the Internet! it was my favorite game ever! I am so happy!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read this book in 3 days! It's a really good book and it kept me interested in it. It was a great story to read.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Even if you seen it before, see it again.<br />Lot of great actors & unforgettable scenes<br />that deliver excitement at every turn & motor roar.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pc so buy it its so good on my world I have gold<br />So done<br /><br />This game is awesome you guys should buy I play it on the kindle and
B001E75QH0|5.0|The Indiana Jones Triology at its best.  Only missing the last movie, 'Silicon Sculls'<br />but you can purchase that one anywhere.
037582913X|5.0|My son is only 2 years old so he doesn't fully understand the concept of actually listening to a story when it's being read. However, he does like to look at the pictures in this book by himself. I love his independance, and I'm sure once he's a little older, he will enjoy me reading this book to him. The book is creative and the graphics are great. I personally love this book for my toddler.<br /><br />Update: My son will be 3 in a couple months and is now interacting with this book when I read it to him. I'll ask him questions like if we should turn to the next page or tell him to show me his muscles to show me how strong he is before we turn the page with the brick. He's a big reader and listener now, so I'm glad I bought this book for him :)
0767812166|5.0|For anyone who likes sci fi pull out your chair for<br />a lot of fun.  Appeals to both sexes and more. Update 4/2013: great<br />soundtrack, romance, fantastic cinematography, beautiful places, fast cars,<br />great special effects.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the movie was. Kept me into it until the very end. Best book I've been able to read.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Burt  Lancaster appearance just adds that much more<br />to this sci fi family picture.  This is considered top 100 rentals & worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Trust me on this. THIS GAME IS WORTH IT.I have play minecraft on the kindle fire for about 1 day and all I say is wow just... wow! If any mojang member is reading tell notch he has done good! I have played minecraft on the computer, X-box, and now the kindle fire
B00ACFL69C|4.0|William Friedkin is a director people either love or hate.  Interestingly, ambiguity in human nature is the theme most often explored in his films.  This film is populated with few, if any likeable characters.  Though they are interesting!  Much has been said about Matthew McConaughey's performance, and indeed it is noteworthy.  Much better than his overrated Magic Mike.  I particularly like Emile Hirsch as the dim wit that hatches a convoluted plan to kill his mother. There are also good performances from the rest of the cast.  There's a certain surrealism to Killer Joe.  You watch most of the movie in disbelief.  Is this for real?  The seedy locale-supposedly Dallas (the movie was shot in New Orleans) is perfect.  I dare say they couldn't have picked more suitable locations to support the dilapidated world these people live.  Shot beautifully, and edited with a pace that reminds you that Friedkin is the same man that gave us two near perfect films (The French Connection. and The Exorcist) Both still stand after 40 years.  I don't think this effort reaches that level of excellence, but it is apparent that you are watching the work of one of the most underestimated directors ever.  Friedkin has never gotten his due. Killer Joe proves he is still able to deliver a visceral, exciting, and original movie experience.  Check out some of his other films:  To Live and Die in LA, Rampage, Cruising, Sorcerer, Bug, and of course the aforementioned French Connection and Exorcist.  All explore the duality of man and make for compelling viewing.  As a viewer of a Friedkin film you are never quite sure where the characters stand, or how you feel about them, and there are no tidy answers. You are usually left with more questions.  Not typical hollywood fluff.  When he came to prominence as a filmmaker, movies that provoked thought were popular.  He hasn't waivered as a filmmaker-the taste of the audience has!  Killer joe definitely provokes,and jolts-like a double shot of red bull.  Warning:  this film has some scenes of intense violence.  I had to look away twice, but wasn't distracted.  It seemed relevant, and indicative of just how depraved a world these characters live.  The film is funny and repellent at the same time.  Definitely worth a watch!
B005HSL626|5.0|Easy to play; fun to use.  I would play it again, and recommend it to anyone. Great game for all
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I supppose this was designed for tablets etc. but does not work well with my phone. Thought I would give it a try
B003TSEEDY|5.0|5 stars for this amazing book. This was such an invigorating novel and had so many qualities that one looks for when reading a book. Fell in love with Charlie from the first few pages and I could really understand how he was feeling. When reading this book I felt like I was Charlie and everything he felt I felt. The world around me because a blur when I was engaged in this novel and its made me realize how I want to live my life and it was truly one of the most inspirational novels I have ever read and its the last book I've read...also making it my favorite Thank you Stephen Chbosky!
1593083092|3.0|Not a thrilling story. But it's a canonical book and a required reading for my advanced placement English class this summer
B005LAIIQC|2.0|What a difference a director and actor make. Paul Greengrass perfected his frenetic, hyperactive technique with the Bourne Ultimatum, which made the original Bourne Identity look a little tame by comparison. The brilliant masterpiece that was Ultimatum stands in stark contrast to this well-meaning effort, which, despite a lot of time, money, and talent, falls flat. A big chase scene at the end does not a movie make. Also, if you are not completely familiar with the first three movies, you will be lost.<br /><br />If I described the first half of this film to you, with its multiple subplots and frantic cross-cutting, you'd think it sounded pretty good. In reality, it is leaden, full of limp scenes that fail to have the intended effect. At this stage in action movies, watching a guy hiking Alaska and climbing cliffs is not particularly exciting, despite the cross-cutting to show us what was going on in the next room during the last half hour of the Bourne Ultimatum. In fact, much of the first half is glacial. One can only imagine what the editor's big brother, director Tony Gilroy, gave him to work with if this was the best he could do.  Scenes mostly never generate the feelings we assume they were going for. For example, Aaron Cross's sojourn with another mysterious program agent in a remote cabin is clearly supposed to be tense and suspenseful, but it plays out like we are forced to watch two closeted men set up on an awkward blind date. A visit to Rachel Weisz's lab is similarly boring. An interrogation scene features assassins so skillfully playing caring therapists that the suspense never builds properly.<br /><br />Another part of the problem is Jeremy Renner, a fine actor but not a particularly likeable one. His odd, pop-eyed looks make him appear slightly R-word, which, we learn, his character was until genetically engineered by the world's cutest scientist. So our hero's motivation is merely to keep getting the drugs that prevent him from regressing back intoCletus the Slack Jawed Yokel. Gone is the ongoing battle between Jason Bourne's programming to kill and his resurgent sense of morality, replaced here by a junkie's need to get his next fix. In a deleted scene, we see that, if necessary, Cross is perfectly willing to stab to death an innocent State Trooper who stops him for speeding. Hardly a hero to root for.<br /><br />As for \\"finishing what Bourne started\\" as the tag line proclaimed, nothing like that happens. In fact, by movie's end, we are set up for at least two more sequels, as the villains appear more powerful and untouchable than ever, with poor Pam Landy hung out to dry and Noah Vosen back in the game.<br /><br />There is a terrific motorbike chase at the end and a scary look at where your prescription might actually be coming from, but, as said before, that does not a movie make.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|The screen was too dark and blinked.  parts were covered in black squares. Could not read any of the wording. tried uninstall and reinstall 3 times, Same problems. Boooo
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Combine logic, and thinking outside the box, with the physics of construction and you have a winning combination.  Has kept me engaged for hours!  Well executed and engaging app.  Limited instructions, but all you need to do is read the signs and experiment a bit.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was a very good book. Our book club discussed it and we all enjoyed it. Our discussion lasted longer than usual because of the characters and how they impacted the story. Thumbs Up on this one!
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I was kind of let down by this movie.  I love acapella, and a few parts were filled with really good acapella, but there weren't nearly enough of them.  And you would think that the best songs / compilations would have been saved for the final competition, but this wasn't the case at all.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is my Grandauthers favorite show, she had missed a few shows the first season, so I bought it for her for Christmas. She loved it.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This movie was about as good as I expected it to be.  It was entertaining, for adults and kids both, and had the bonus of a good message about the decisions we make.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is my Grandaughters favorite show. She missed a few shows, due to a heavy study load. Got her this for a gift, she loved it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I just finished this book, and although Part 1 was not quite as interesting, the rest of this book is extremely interesting. If your one of those people looking for a story on adventure, this is probably the best choice.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and her boyfriend.  They love the show and were delighted to get it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the Best reads- hands down! I absolutely could not put this book down. Every page left me wanting to know. Fantastic!
B004D9FLJE|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  She was thrilled because she loves the show and had not seen the complete first season.
0062235893|4.0|I got this book for my son for Christmas. The book is great and it's soft just like a pillow. I still feel its a tad bit on the pricey side for a 2 page book but the book is nicely made and not your average book... And it won't rip like other books! All in all it was a lovely gift to my 16 month old.
6305212112|1.0|I purchased this movie for myself and was very disappointed that it is the widescreen edition.  I did not see that when I ordered it and that took some of the fun out of getting it because I HATE widescreen!
630463949X|5.0|The dvd case is a bit flimsy for the money and could be better quality, dvd is prefect though and plays well.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I bought this as a present for myself.  I have Sex and the City 1 and wanted the sequel; very happy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire seems to be the place we go to when have a few minutes to &#34;relax&#34;. The solitaire game on our new Kindle is super. We love it. The graphics are great, card movement is easy, simply put........... it's a plus.
6303011012|5.0|I love my copy and so did my friend. Her copy got stolen when her house got robbed and she has complained about it many times about how much she missed it. She doesn't have a DVD player. I couldn't believe I found it on VHS. She is really going to be surprised when this comes in the mail.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this app ks amazing its goood and its faster to me than the other app on your kindle fire so you should get this makes your life a lott easier.
6304702205|5.0|I still have my copy but my best friend's copy got stolen when her house was robbed and she has complained many times about how much she missed this and she doesn't have a DVD player. I couldn't believe I found it on VHS.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Buy this now!<br /><br />Our local radio station played Breezeblocks, Fitzpleasure, and Tessellate, and Breezeblocks really hooked me.  I bought this album in anticipation of their concert in Kansas City.<br /><br />An Awesome Wave is a great album top to bottom.  Joe Newman has a very unique voice, and the band sounds incredible.  Breezeblocks and Matilda (referencing the awesome movie Léon) are my favorites.  Fitzpleasure, Tessellate, Something Good, and Dissolve Me are all great songs.<br /><br />As a side note, they are amazing live as well.  The band were all sick and even missed their original flight, but fought through and gave a strong performance (minus guitarist Gwil Sainsbury).  We are definitely going to see them in April when they are back in town.
B005779X4U|5.0|Perfect for tight spaces  Its a two in one trash and recycle recepticle.  13 gallon bags fit it so no need to purchase special one  Its is sleek, slim, and great features
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Cute movie that you can watch with your significant other or girlfriends.<br />Feel good movie.  Hit the mark with us older couples.
B009HELT3C|3.0|Good movie, great job at casting. A little more language than the other two movies.  Not as much action in this one but it has a good story
B000LB7G00|5.0|if your in cad, this is pretty much all you will ever need. i bought this for navigation, along with a logitec g300 mouse for the quick macro buttons and they work excellent together. this spaceball is very fluent and smooth! quick response, no lag. buttons are nice and solid, not floating. this one is the heavier of the two cheaper ones from this manufacturer, and it feels very sturdy. i have been using one of these for a year now, and cant imagine rotating another cad model without it!
1423124111|5.0|This book is amazing! Long time Disney fans will love seeing classic posters up close. I never noticed that the original Jungle Cruise poster had a beard and tattoo until I looked at it closely in this book.<br />Even people who aren't Disney fans will love seeing the step by step screen printing process used to create these works of art.<br />It's proudly displayed on my coffee table and it picked up quite often by everyone who sees it.
B006ICOK00|5.0|Imagine if you will, the year 2012 is drawing to a close, the holidays streaming around us, so little time, so much to do, and the sword hanging over my head that I had not accomplished my greatest accomplishment for the year.<br /><br />Interesting doesn't come close to how incredibly cool this camera is. Exceptionally quick to set up and learn, I am charging around the house and neighborhood taking high-quality time-lapse movies of everything from my cats sleeping to my neighbors going about whatever it is neighbors do.<br /><br />The camera is cute, 4 1/4\\" H x 2 1/2\\" W x 1 3/4\\" D. With batteries it is less than 1/2 pound and solid as a rock. Tripod mount on the bottom, but it sits very steadily on four rubber feet.  The lens rotates up and down 120° and has settings for 1 second to 24 hours per image. Accessories like a manual shutter release for single frame photography for stop-action, a water resistant housing, wide angle lens, carrying case, and it supports up to a 32GB SD card. While the product information says it comes with a 2GB card, mine came with a 4GB card.<br /><br />So my dilemma with finding my greatest accomplishment for the year is now behind me. Order your's today.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I went into this book irritated about all the buzz about it. I was sick of hearing about it, and sick of people recommending it to me, and asking me if I read it etc...<br /><br />So I bought it, and I will say I wasn't amazed by it, like some folks seemed to be, and thought it was somewhat predictable, once I understood the premise, but it was entertaining nonetheless. It was an easy read, and in fairness, I tend to predict most books I read and movies I watch... It doesn't spoil it for me.<br /><br />I did have a little difficulty getting into it to start with because it's written in the present tense. I don't know why that made it difficult for me, but for some reason I've always found it distracting... That's my problem though... I always read a sentence, and think &#34;Huh, it's in the present tense, I always prefer the past tense&#34; and then fight that I read the next sentence, but don't remember what it said, and have to go back, then I realize that THAT sentence is ALSO in the present tense (as it should be, right?) and that realization goes through my head again... Like I said though, that's my problem, not the book's.<br /><br />...Though I did notice a couple of spots where there was something in past tense, that should have been in present like the rest of the book... Though I didn't write it down.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was amazing I couldn't put it down I finished it in half a day it was just that good
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Unfortunately for me, I watched the first season on HBO before reading this book, so through most of the book, I was comparing it to the show. On the bright side, the show stuck pretty close to the book in the first season.<br /><br />This is honestly the first fantasy book that I have ever read that I could not predict a thing in. Usually you pick up a Sci-Fi/Fantasy book, and the first character you meet is the one standing over the bad guy's corpse at the end, the hero... This book reliably shocked me and kept me reading through to the end.
B007FJFDXS|1.0|I actually ordered this app and began to download it but changed my mind.  One of the permissions is 'Open Network Sockets'. I usually don't download apps that have that permission but was going to give this one a try.  Seeing 'Full Internet Access' again as a permission in the download process just made me feel uneasy.  Especially since the developer didn't explain why the app needed internet access.  I see no need for the app to be able to access the internet any time it likes. This is the only reason the app gets 1 star.  It may very well be a great game.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. It's such a fun, cute, and surprisingly deep movie.
B00003CX95|2.0|acquired this excellent movie but it brings subtitles in Spanish as the description indicates. Do not buy if you need the subtitles in Spanish.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie by itself, without the book being thought of, is great, but watching the movie after reading the book makes the movie less great. Most of what is happening in the book is Katniss's thoughts, which is difficult to portray without having her mumble to herself (and that would have ruined the movie). I felt like the Rue and Katniss relationship was underdeveloped in the movie, so when Katniss started crying after Rue died, I thought that it would be difficult for people who hadn't read the book to understand why Katniss was so upset. Also, when they would cut to the parts where Caesar and Claudius were explaining what was going on (i.e. the tracker jackers), I knew that this was the movie maker's way of explaining to the people who hadn't read the book, not really the people of the capitol, which took away from the movie. The movie also felt a bit rushed, especially at the end.<br />Still, I think that they did the best they could, and they really did do a good job with the movie. It's not a five-star movie (because of the faults explained above), but it is a strong four-star. I really think that the effects and visuals helped the movie a lot because, visually, the movie was amazing; I LOVE how they portrayed the capitol and really showed the bizarreness of it.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is a wonderful book for people of all ages. It is pretty good litature, and holds you till you finish it. if you have the capability of reading the other books in the &#34;tom sawyer&#34; series, read them.<br />however, tom sawyer is my favorite of all of Mark Twain's books.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|It is ok. I thought it was going to be a better movie, that is all. I enjoyed it anyway.
0307394549|5.0|It was a great gift for a new baker, and was greatly appreciated. I enjoyed giving this book for Christmas.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This trilogy is worth reading.  I started and couldn't stop until I finished the last one. Anyone who likes thrillers and mysteries will love this book.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I really enjoyed it! The story hit home in many ways and kept me interested all the way through. Wow
0440246016|4.0|Published by Dell in 2012.<br />Originally published in in 2007 by Delacorte Press<br /><br />I must live under a rock. I had not read any Jack Reacher novel until I read this one and I had not even heard of the series until last summer when a fellow blogger was excitedly talking about the latest release.<br /><br />So, what did I think?<br /><br />First of all, you do not have to have read any of the rest of the series to follow what is happening in this story. Jack Reacher is a drifter and he has been since he retired from the U.S. Army in 1997. In the military he led an investigation squad of the military police. Like Clint Eastwood's famed \\"Man WIth No Name\\" character from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Reacher says little, keeps his own counsel and does what he thinks is best, follow his own sense of justice and drifts from place to place.<br /><br />In \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\", Reacher receives a message from a former member of his unit. He tracks her down and discovers that another former member was murdered - dropped from a helicopter in the desert outside of Los Angeles. The re-assemble as many members as they can and soon discover that four former members are missing, presumed dead. They vow to discover who did this and get revenge.<br /><br />This is an action-packed book and I blew right through it. This is not deep literature, but it is solid escapist story-telling. The characters are under-developed and I got a little tired of the Jack Reacher personae (ultra-stoic tough guy). I appreciate tough guy stories but I really like them to have an abundance of personality like Robert B. Parker's Spenser or Robert Crais's Elvis Cole. Reacher's lack of personality (or, perhaps, an over-abundance of focus on the problem at hand) scream for someone to lighten the mood from time to time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In book two we see our heroes re-enter the arena. I didn't know how the author could follow-up Book 1, but she does in grand fashion. The descriptions of the perils and the new-found relationships amongst competitors is fascinating. Thanks for a great book!
0547884591|5.0|I GAVE THIS BOOK TO THREE PEOPLE FOR CHRISTMAS AND THEY WERE ALL FACINATED BY THE VARIETY OF INFORMATION.  I WAS JUST SURPRISED AT HOW BIG THE BOOK WAS.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|I'd never heard Cuban's story before. It was great to hear, from his own mouth, where he came from. Some funny stories that I could definitely relate to as an entrepreneur.
0205313426|4.0|My high school English compostion teacher drilled &#34;Elements of Style&#34; into our heads almost fifty years ago, and it has stood me in good stead ever since.  Having forgotten much of it, however, I ordered the new edition as a refresher, and I'm not disappointed.  It doesn't cover all the questions that come up (use of elipses, brackets vs. parentheses, for example), but even if not comprehensive it is still the most user-friendly guide I know of, and a pleasure to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I picked this up a while ago because I kept seeing it rising in the bestseller ranks. The hype did not disappoint. I've gone back and read it three times. The character development among the contestants and Capital-Folk is awesome.
6305212112|5.0|I watch this movie at least once a month. Mary Louise Parker is outstanding as are the other main actors. Parker also played an excellent role in 'Red' with bruce willis and morgan freeman,and john malkovich .<br />I don't know how fried green tomatoes got tagged as a chick flick,this old man absolutely loves it.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|If you're looking to build a brand, get this book. Vaynerchuk has been there and done that. He is complete no BS and tells you like it is. I've bookmarked and highlighted the heck out of the summary in the back of the book. I keep going back to it.
0316069434|5.0|It was a great Harry Bosch read.and better than many others that I have read.  Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Somehow I never read this book growing up. The new cover caught my eye and I decided to get it. One word: WOW! I read the book twice in a week then went digging for anything I could find on the book. Can't wait for the movie too!
075669812X|4.0|It was based off the TV show, but some facts I found, should be reworded to make more sense. I would recommend this product to my friends, James H., Kaleb, and Luke.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I'm not a Country-Western fan. but I can listen to Taylor around the clock. This album is just as good as her other two. A must for any Taylor Swift fan.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is such a fun game....I am an older citizen and this game is very mind stimulating.  Can do this for hours.
075669812X|5.0|Godchild loved this present.  He was the only one of his friends to get it.  He started reading it immediately, which he does not like to read that much.  He reads it everyday.

B009WO7NQO|3.0|I got the game for my son to play on my/our fire.  He loves it and it honestly is fun to play. i have to say this is probably my favorite of the Angry Birds.  As for my son he thinks it is the COOLEST.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Great dancing, Great story line. confusing but good.  If you like ballet, you'll like this movie. At some points its eerie.
B005OP7162|5.0|I didn't get a chance to get into this show from the start.... I of course got interested in it half way thru the first season. So I watched some on Amazon or on my TV on demand.  I loved Desperate Housewives... but this is different. We all have wanted to get revenge on someone in some-point in our lives. Emily/Amanda really does.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|...hard to see Abe as a vampire hunter...not a good story plot.<br />would have been more realistic in a different time period.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|It was two minutes of totally nothing.  Thank goodness it was free. It hinted at nothing except Shiley McLaine was joining the excellent cast and that was all over the news and more...
B0084U0IEG|3.0|It seemed like the author had the Thesaurus sitting open as he wrote this novel. Maybe he was hoping that one of his obscure words would stump the reader. He could have used more conversational terms.  &#34;Can I easily put this book down and come back to it sometime later?&#34; is my criteria for a good piece of fiction.  This one was easy to set down.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Sexy without overdoing it. Two people with painful pasts fall in love with each other and heal together. A few twists and turns along the way, and a murder, makes this book easily enjoyable.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Love listening to the soundtrack and watching the film. Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, and Brittany Snow made it worth listening to the soundtrack and seeing the movie over and over and over.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Love it... I used it in my courses...<br />Love it... I used it in my courses...<br /><br />Me gusto mucho lo utilizo en mis cursos de introduccion a las computadoras.

B006KX3GXO|2.0|Quality of image was ok, but on my kindle fire, the image was upside down! I could not get it to be right side up! I hope the app gets reworked!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|The audio from the microphone works and sounds perfectly, the hardware is sturdy and dependable, and overall, I LOVE IT!
0307744434|4.0|What I loved most about this book: the narrative.<br /><br />It was unique, carefully crafted, shifting in and out of years, back and forth in time, moving from third person to second person. It builds the anticipation so much that I read this in one day. I couldn't put the darn book down. I knew each character that the author introduced was somehow connected to the others, that she was spinning a very intricate web.<br /><br />For the narrative, build up, and page turning suspense, I give this novel 5 stars.<br /><br />For the characters and climax, I give 3 stars.<br /><br />So, for an average, the book falls to 4 stars.<br /><br />Yes, like other reviewers have mentioned, I found some of the characters lacking. Unfortunately, Marco fell very flat to me. I have no idea why, but he came across as a weak, whiny, desperate man. I would not have fallen for him. Celia, at least, was a bit stronger to me. I could understand her coldness, her quiet inward strength. I felt more bonded to her than to Marco. I didn't mind the slow burning romance. I felt it very appropriate, but then once it happened, the romance was glitchy at best. I understand the tents, the circus, the collaboration was the deepest factor to their relationship. Yes, in a way it is like writing love letters back and forth. But somehow, I just didn't feel convinced of it.<br /><br />Honestly, my favorite characters were Poppet, Widget and Bailey. These three were so marvelously created, I had to remind myself they weren't real.<br /><br />The climax (I'll try not to spoil anything, but read carefully). I feel a little perturbed when I think about it. From the beginning of the book, I expected something massive to occur towards the end. I guess I envisioned Marco and Celia physically having to square off to one another. But it's not like that. The opponent that loses is the one that becomes too tired in the end, who has the least endurance. Would they collapse of a heart attack, then? I'm not quite sure. Idon't wish to give away a spoiler, so I will just say I felt a little down when it happened. I turned the page and thought, \\"that's it?\\" Perhaps it is books like THE HUNGER GAMES that have spoiled me when it comes to quieter, stiller climaxes. Yes, it felt urgent to me, and my heart was racing alongside Bailey (see, once again, I was more in tune to Bailey than Celia or Marco...)I felt a little disappointed, and I still don't know why.<br /><br />Above all, this book was worth a day of my Christmas break. I fervently enjoyed the author's strong imagery, her impeccable narrative. She got me so wrapped up in the circus, I felt as if I too, was one of the red scarf wearers.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Fast delivery and it made an awesome gift. I'm hooked on homeland. If you are into spy and action thrillers you'll love homeland.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Game is the best have it on xbox its the only game I play love it clear space for best game ever 7 dollars don't waste your money on Vickie or those other fakes apps get this one
B000I186FW|5.0|i enjoy movies with a good storyline and convincing characters played by convincing actors. this movies has them all. great storyline that is entertaining. they picked the right actors for the parts and had good character development. overall, jus a fun movie to watch!
B004GYY714|5.0|I live in the middle of nowhere and I like to listen to my nephew play basketball. I use this app to catch his games and it works perfectly for that purpose. The only problem I run into is sometimes the sound isnt' as loud as I would like from some of the stations. I don't think this is an app problem, I think it probably has something to do with the equipment the announcers use to broadcast the games.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The man and his wife are flawed, both of them. The wife is a manipulative sociopath and the husband is very weak-spined. They really deserve each other. The plot development is really good, but usually the reader can root for a person to win out. Not here. The villain's supposed charisma doesn't transcend the book to touch the reader. Too bad, it could have been otherwise.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the last book I read in the series and Ii especially liked the way it ended.  It was very suspenseful throughout the entire series, with a lot of drama.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Very Satisfied! I am happy with the product and the speed in which I received it! Can't wait to enjoy it!
B007W7P5L8|4.0|Good and sturdy. Great if you have kids. Elastic strap to keep it closed helps keep the screen clean and holds the stylus in
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|This carrying case is perfect for my over the ear bluetooth.  It snaps shut with magnetics and small so easy to stash in purse or pocket.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This book was very amazing because you know the words he is saying are true and that he wrote this himself. I recommend that even non beliebers should read this because this book will most likely change your point of view of him. Most people are thinking \\"what is this? A kid who is writing about his life? C`Mon he is still young!\\" Actually he mentions many times that he is still  a kid and growing up. That is why the book is called \\"Just Getting Started\\" . This book is amazing and I recommend it to everyone.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I still don't get it. It is fun the little I have done it!  I will keep trying as I have more time

B0094BB4TW|4.0|I still cannot see all the apps when I am trying to do something on Facebook, but will learn as I go.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Beautifully written from an interesting perspective of a boy in ninth grade. I really  this book an  eighth grade for the first time and now again as a senior in college this really is a timeless book. I took so much more away reading it this time around.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|i stream it thru my PS3 without any problem. The option to select the movie was very user friendly. The movie inforamation were helpful
B006OAB3ME|4.0|So far, so good.  The bulb included is a very bright, artificial looking bluish light, but my wife loves it for her needlepoint and it is very good for reading.  Very attractive looking as well.

B008ELUEQC|5.0|It sure was, listening to my favorite artist. I was a little disappointed that I did not get it whemit was on $6.99, however it was worth it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know if it's love or lust that draws me to this book. Maybe lust to begin with then I fell in love with the characters. Worth the read.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Excellent movie! Eastwood did his usual good job on this film. The main character is played in Eastwood's usual understated, yet powerful way. It was good to see Eastwood back in the genre that first brought him to the attention of the American public.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am an avid gamer and being on a budget this year wasn't helpful when I had to buy a new mouse when my old one was suddenly ruined. My Anker mouse just came in today and for the price I do not know how they are making any money off of these because they are such high quality.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|***UPDATE 12/29/12  One reviewer felt the controls were too sensitive on a Kindle Fire.  If using Finger Swipes, I kind of agree. I was using a stylus and did not have any problems. Since TIME plays a role in your score(GRADE), the level of sensitivity becomes valuable as you become accustomed to it. I agree with Whistling Wind in that the ability to adjust the sensitivity would be a worthwhile addition to the game.<br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/28/12  Loaded on a Kindle Fire(not HD). I've only played it about 20 minutes, forced myself to take a break, and submit a review so people will snag a free copy.  I remember playing its predecessor on a tiny Blackberry Pearl screen.  The game was well-suited to the small field.  No doubt, it will prove to be a serious time eater.<br /><br />PROS<br />Intuitive controls and play.<br />Clean graphics.<br />Satisfying difficulty ramp-up.<br />Price.  A bargain at $2.99.  No-brainer FAOTD download.<br />Sounds?  Don't know, I turn them off.<br /><br />CONS<br />I really cannot point to a single imperfection.<br /><br />The only reason I would give this less than 5 stars is that some people doubt the validity of 5-star reviews.  In this case, however, I could not contrive criticisms to lower the grade.  Have fun!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love the graphics on this game. I can't stop playing the fame since I love animals. This game requires patience but other than that it's fun to play. However, there needs to be more fuel for the car because it sucks when u run out of gas in the middle of a rescue mission. Also the food u give to animals should use less coins.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I so identified with the Carson in this book. I think this story is a honest look at some of the struggles we all faced as teenagers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the whole Hunger Games series. The books are always good. They have really good descriptions. It's a great book.
B00367XA1K|4.0|This film is a classic story with real characters played by some of the best actors. Warren Beatty outdid himself in his directing. It is a keeper.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app to have in your life there should be more like it. I am so happy that I got this app. I highly recommend it.

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I haven't even played it and I now its a ripoff of minecraft. Yes, minecraft might not have gurmanium or whatever but it was the original.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|You know there are NOT enough stars to rate this item that is HOW unique it is.  Jimmy Page is the MASTER GUITAR player just as John Paul Jones is the MASTER KEYBOARD, BASS, whatever instrument he plays, Jason Bonham HE MADE HIS FATHER PROUD and Robert Plant still has it even if he thinks he doesn't.<br /><br />This is a MUST HAVE for ANY TRUE LED ZEPPELIN fan; then again anyone who wishes to learn about the blues, rock and roll, jazz you have to get this product so that maybe you too can learn how to create what is slowly being fazed out by RAP and ALTERNATE MUSIC....On the Kennedy Awards the front man of FOO FIGHTERS needs to be replaced as he did a quite poor replicate Wanna Whole Lot of Love; Kid Rock with Rambling did ok; Lenny Kravitz was good though Nancy and Mary Wilson along with Jason Bonham took the show with STAIRWAY to HEAVEN...I was crying as were Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones along with some in the audience.  If you didn't shed tears during this performance - ... - if on the other hand you did  WHOOO RAHHH!!!!<br /><br />I HIGHLY ADVISE this product....100% + satisfaction

B008CPZNL6|5.0|My wife has used Flipboard for about a year on her iPad2, but I was worried about how it would display on the 7&#34; Fire HD. It's fine. Once you get used to only having one or two synopses on the screen, you'll forget about the difference in form factors.
030758836X|2.0|I like a good thriller and wanted some mindless reading, so I purchased this for my Kindle. I give it two stars because, inexplicably, I was compelled to keep reading and discover the ending. The entirety of the book was extremely predictable. As I was reading up to something, I'd think \\"oh I bet this is going to happen,\\" and it would. Every time. And the ending, as others have stated, was literally the worst ending out of any book ever, in the history of books. I honestly can't recommend wasting your money, or your time, on this novel.
1609611543|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone.  It raises excellent questions about what we are eating today with all the modified foods and provides a rational approach to making dietary changes that can truly be life saving.  A friend referred me to the book due to my GF diet and I would encourage anyone who indulges in carbo loading, which tends to mean lots of wheat based products are in the shopping cart, to add this to their must read list.  My partner and I have read it through and through and use it as reference for the well researched information and the fabulous recipes.  I just received the Wheat Belly Cookbook and expect to immerse myself in it this weekend.
1451627297|5.0|When Stephen King writes a love story it is the best kinda story. Whether that love is for best friends (Shawshank) or about his profession (Writing) or the love a man can have for a woman (11/22/63) King writes it so well you feel it and want to skip along after it. This man doesn't have a dark black heart filled with horror tales..that man has a dark red heart full of love. You don't write about love like that unless you feel it everyday. He obviously has great friends (Shawshank), great passions (Writing) and a has/had great woman (11/22/63).<br />Read it. Read this book and then hug it when you are done.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|I really wish I could respond with unbounded enthusiasm for this device because that's what I was hoping for but unfortunately, at least for me, it is a complete bust.  In either mode on my Lenovo laptop all it did was create a profile that was slightly brighter.<br /><br />What it created for my Samsung T260 secondary is hard to describe.  The colors might be all right but there is absolutely no contrast nor black level.  It is totally washed out and unviewable.  I got the same with easy and advanced modes.<br /><br />'Fraid it's got to go back.
B000IZA9PI|3.0|I grew up with TNG.  I remember it being a LOT better than this.  Oh well, it's still a classic I guess.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The price was great and the set up was awesome ,the movie itself was a great trilogy and I had to own it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Addicting!! I love solitaire.  It is just regular solitaire but that is fine by me, passes the time by.  Nothing fance
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Game made for kids, but too complicated without adult help.  No easy exit.  Real money items not clearly identified from game token item purchases.  Once an adult figures it all out and demonstrates kids are ok, but it isn't something little ones can get on their own.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire, it's colorful and fun... and can be addicting.  Other than a variance in how you hit the flippers feels like a real pinball machine.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed this book.. yummy, I enjoyed sharing  this book with my boyfriend. He was shocked on the graphic details.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|The main reason I bought this app was so I could use not just view track changes. I did lots of research and the website said one of the features was track changes. It should have been more specific. Also, it only syncs sigh dropbox. It needs to give more options.
B004W648Y2|5.0|These deluxe additions are something special!! I've always considered Arthur as \\"the low point\\" in the great album run from face to face thru lola, but after spending time with the mono and stereo versions, I'm going to have to reconsider that!!<br /><br />This was my first experience with the mono, and although there are not as many differences as there are on something else, they are there. The main difference with this package over previous additions is the sound-WOW!! Acoustic guitars ring out sharp and clear, the production comes to the forefront and, is that tambourine I'm hearing? On a KinKs song? It sure is!<br /><br />Most of the bonus tracks were included on the last Arthur release, but, again, the sound is so superior! And the backing track for shangra-la-it may not be Brian Wilson, but Ray does a heck of a job!!<br /><br />The only problem becomes what to do with the previous versions? Don't think the neighborhood dog would even chase them as frisbees!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Horribly written, boring characters, even worse story line.  The sex scenes (which were few) were silly and seemed to borrow from the imagination of a 15 year old adolescent.  Everything about this book is predictable.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I had this for iPhone and had to get it after I got a Galaxy tablet and phone for Christmas I use it for local stations and podcast.
B001EC2J20|1.0|After watching the Matrix through Amazon instant video, which was great by the way, we watched Matrix Reloaded. No story line, pointless sex scenes. It's like they all of a sudden realized they didn't have any sex in the first one and decided to make up for it in the second!  Stupid!  The fight scenes were terrible. It was nothing compared to the first one. Plus it kept freezing over and over again. We haven't finished it. I'm not sure we will. Netflix is better than Amazon in my opinion.
B009IQ2JZQ|3.0|I can't deny that this 5 disc combo pack is the most complete disc set I could find. However the case is not originally design for 5 disc, it's just designed for 2 discs. 2 other discs are placed above the first 2 discs, and the last disc is attached outside the case, in a paper bag.<br />Very good disc content, very bad case.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I order 2 Harry Potter movies and was very disappointed to see that they had been damaged during the shipping. I got my new movies 2 days later and the return was SUPER EASY.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I liked this film and regret that it's filming contributed to the death of Heath Ledger.  While many prefer the original Nicholson Joker's TV-series-esque madcap behavior, Mr. Ledger turned in a solid performance of the Killing Joke, Joker.  Arguably the best and most terrifying Joker of them all.<br /><br />All this has been said before, but it bears repeating: the cast, direction, and script are all aces.  A great snapshot of Batman's true sacrifice and heroism.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This little application is Very handy to log into a remote device, even on 4G. It has allowed me to make quick changes without having to go in or find another desktop unit.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Mr. Mitchell's Cloud Atlas jumps around.  A lot.  Patience is rewarded as the author eventually explains everything in sometimes overt, but usually subtle fashion.  As the characters appear through time, each chapter has it's own dialect of English, ranging from Victorian slang to some amusing and logical extensions of our present penchant for abbreviating everything.  The dialectical gear shifts vividly illustrate each setting as a backdrop to the characters' thoughts and actions.<br /><br />Do not let this deter you, as quite a lot is usually explained by each chapter's end.  Hang on for tragedy, humor, villainy, and most of all, love.
B001FB5634|5.0|this was a gift for my dad.  he read the book and then for the next few months all he kept talking about was seeing the movie (which never happnens).  he loved the movie.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle Season 5 continues to be intriguing with Beckett and Castle's relationship struggles.  Each episode makes me laugh, cry, and ponder.  I especially like one of Beckett's quotes from Season 5, &#34;Even on the worst days, there's a possibility for joy.&#34;
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first, but the book is much more fantastic. Fabulous writing and I can't wait to read the other books!
B005R32L66|2.0|Tried several times and it wouldn't download completely on my smart phone.  I got a Vontage download to work with the calls I needed, but no accompanying screenshots.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|this is what I would expect from this group and more. I can't wait until Part II comes out and is released
B00009VTX8|5.0|It's Sharon Stone. O.KI., the review says I need to add 10 more words....let's see. It's Sharon Freaking Stone. Nuff said.
B009DH372Y|5.0|one of many memorable performances and in true Queen form, a must see performance, true Freddie Mercury performance, very memorable
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game so far. kinda early for them to ask for a review. i got this. app for free so its worth it!
B000V6ACKG|4.0|this is music that I grew up with and I haven't forgotten it, I still love to listen to this music, it brings back memories both good and bad
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever. it is so addicting and fun. definitely try this game! liked temple run but better. also has a holiday mode if you download right now
B009E9R2OK|5.0|it's the zep. what can u say although i miss bonzo, his son is a very,very good drummer.<br /><br />i've been listening to Zeppelin for 40 years. it's a great disc.....
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It helps me unwind The only draw back is that it is very addictive and I have to get back to work
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is a treat for the mind.  It is perfect for kids and adults and every one In between. Although it has crude hummer I've read worse books. Try hunger games for example, it's a bunk of kids in a room killing each other, if you aloud your child or teenager or you to read it your a bad parent. Give them this instead  That guy of the twenty people who didn't like this book and said it's junk food of literature,yay I'm talking to you, your crazy
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Even as forgiving as i've been with this fun and outlandish franchise, this one had no redeeming qualities. Sorry Milla!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Love the mix of people Rod sang with - very good rendition of old songs -A Must Have to complete a Christmas collection.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I am new to Twitter & I am not sure exactly how it works.  I need to work on it
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|I dont like to see a subject like this in animation. I rented it for my grandkids but this is not a kids movie! Too heavy!
0307716546|5.0|I read Sister yesterday, and just finished Afterwards... I am at a loss for words.  Best book I've ever read.  Amazing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Put this on my wife's Kindle and it does keep her entertained... but she prefers other versions. Nothing wrong with the app - just isn't as familiar as what she's used to playing. Certainly good enough to recommend to a friend - and foe - but....
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Lyrical, witty, heartwarming, original.  The performances are brilliant--especially Owen Wilson's.  The music is perfect & memorable.  One of Woody Allen's masterpieces.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I was very let down by this movie. It was all over the place and all that ceative weirdness of the orginal film was not at all in this one. WHERE'S QUATO!?
1426209584|5.0|Great photography, excellent info on the birds including habitat, ranges, and population density, gives infomation never found in a easy to understand format.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Cruise haters will still hate, but he is awesome. The music again, awesome.  Music of my youth, loved reliving it.
