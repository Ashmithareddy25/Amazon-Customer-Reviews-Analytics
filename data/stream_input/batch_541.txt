B000AA305M|5.0|I created my account at Amazon.com to write this review for Mr. David Gray's CD \\"Life in Slow Motion\\".   <br />I bought this CD nearly two months ago when it first came out and still listen to it on a daily basis. <br />I was not a fan of Gray before this CD, all I had heard of his was the song \\"Babylon\\" which didn't really catch my interest when it was released.   <br />Something told me to buy this CD and I can honestly say this is truly one of the best CDs I have ever bought.  I am a lover of all music from rock to country to folk...and this CD is MUSIC to me.  Beautiful music.   <br />The combination of track #1 \\"Alibi and #2 \\"The One I Love\\" is my favorite part of the CD with track #7 \\"Ain't No Love\\" being the climax of this CD.  \\"Ain't No Love\\" is one of the best songs I have ever come across in my life.  If nothing else, please take time to listen to that song.   <br />Put this CD into your car player and go drive through the city somewhere or put it in at home and turn off the lights.  This CD will carry you away.  This is beautiful music. <br />I will be honest, Tracks #3, #4 and #6 are weaker tracks on this CD for me.  Otherwise and overall, this is a masterpiece in my eyes.
B0000844I8|5.0|this movie is well worth seeing. The dvd is crisp, clean, and a family adventure for older children.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After falling in love belatedly with this series when it was rebroadcast on my favorite network, I convinced most of my family to go see the movie with me (my sister 2 times back to back!).  Then, I lent them the DVD's I had bought knowing that SciFi wouldn't finish airing all the shows before the movie was released.<br /><br />Now, knowing that the movie and the DVD's are all there is, my Mom is mad at me for getting her hooked.  She called me up this morning to tell me she had just watched 'Out of Gas', and loving it, her fondest part was the last scene of Mal looking longingly for the first time at Serenity.<br /><br />How does this help you?  While I am a staunch sci-fi fan, my Mom is the Survivor and Amazing Race type. She still watches ER, and The West Wing.  If, despite her preferences, she can fall in love with this series, so will you.<br /><br />Besides, the more people who buy this, the greater the chances of there being more shows/movies made, the greater my chance of getting back on my Mom's good side sometime this decade!
B000002UC5|5.0|Domestic homespun charm from a man who, at the time this record was made (1970), was already the most successful (and brilliant) musician in the world.  (He has just completed, and essentially masterminded Abbey Road, arguably the greatest rock record ever made.)  \\"McCartney\\" exudes a confidence in that fact. Paul's in his home studio just humming melodies, recording songs as they come to him, carefree.  Linda and the family were giving Paul a great deal of confidence in himself and his music, and great deal of happiness.  Paul really feels like he can \\"be himself\\" on this record.  It's likely his best solo record. <br />  <br />Part of what makes this album a classic is the fact that it was made while the Beatles were still together; it is within the \\"penumbras and emanations\\" of the Beatles, as it were.  This record SOUNDS like the Beatles, or at least the McCartney side of the Beatles. I love it.    <br /> <br />Highlights:   <br />  <br />The first track, \\"Lovely Linda,\\" clocks in at about 20 seconds, and is a sign of things to come on the record.  This is an off-the-cuff masterpiece.  The recording sounds like it was the first time, and the last time, McCartney ever played the song.  And it probably was. Macca pounds on a book for rhythms, the McCartney babies laughing in the background towards the end.  <br /> <br />\\"That Would Be Something\\" is McCartney meets Howlin' Wolf or Robert Johnson.   Like \\"Lovely Linda\\" the entire lyric is basically one line, over and over again. But it's a great 'un:  \\"That would be something, to meet you in the falling rain.\\"       The emotion and soul of the vocal are amazing.  The backing track on this is titillatingly loose, sounding as if the whole \\"band\\" could fall apart at any moment.  But it doesn't.  It just keeps on ticking.  (Many of Dylan's best recordings have this feel.) McCartney scats and sings the percussion track, which is a treat. (Why not? He sang the bass line in  \\"I Will.\\")  <br /> <br />\\"Junk\\" is one of the best melodies he's ever written.  I believe he was kicking this around as far back as the White Album, but never got around to releasing it.  The lyric is plaintive and  prosaic, but marvelously cryptic.  <br /> <br />\\"Man We Was Lonely\\" has a country and rockabilly flavor in the verse.  But the middle is pure McCartney--\\"Now let me lie with my love for a time, i am home, home, home.\\"  Glorious.  <br /> <br />\\"Ooh you\\" struts along like a Stones tune.  I love the way it starts off and how Paul says \\"more guitar.\\"  This one sounds like it was knocked off in about five minutes.  But it's timeless.    <br /> <br />\\"Maybe I'm amazed\\" is one of his best love anthems.   <br /> <br />Check out this record, and then check out his new one, Chaos and Creation.  His first and his latest may be his two finest records.
B00006EXL5|3.0|the music is a lil' over done and loud for my taste, but this is a reaaly good lyrical album. Fans of literary songwriting and lyrics will enjoy this one. the only minus here is that the music is more agressive than it needs to be and sometimes overcomes some very interesting writing and ideas. For new stuff tho this is very well done!
078681859X|4.0|The Amulet of Samarkand introduces us to Nathaniel, a young aspiring magician in a world run by magicians, and the petulant, but lovable djinn Bartimaeus.  All adventures are told from the viewpoint of Bartimaeus so there is a lot of commentary on the human world from a supposed outsider.  This side of things made the story interesting to me due to the fact that the entirity of Earth in this book is being run by a group of people who are exploiting \\"non-people\\" to stay in power.
B0007XT87G|5.0|the best thing about this cd is that it takes the listener on a trip through so many different styles, but manages to hold together well. The songwriting is amazing here, and really makes the listener. it is a very mature rock record which will please old and new fans. one of my favorites!
0380973650|3.0|In this novel there is a god for just about anything, if you can think of it, it exists.  The protagonist ends up between a confrontation between the gods waning in power and those waxing in power or the newly-pseudo-omnipotent. The travelogue style of the book is really what makes this an interesting read.  You feel like you are in a cross country adventure.  In the country of Estonia, this book has been translated into the language of Estonian.  If you would like an idea what the novel is like, peruse pages 42 to 44.  This is an unusual and an erotic part of the book, that although the rest is not quite as titillating, gives a good sense of its style.
B00062J00S|5.0|Director Frank Capra's mesmerizing masterpiece and a gift to mankind, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a glorious tour-de-force that richly deserves its status as Hollywood's most fascinating and magical movies. Hollywood screen legend James Stewart superbly plays George Bailey, a thoroughly decent guy who after being financially ruined by his evil and scheming rival Mr. Potter, becomes despondent and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. But before he can do so, a man falls into the water below. George jumps in to save him and finds out that the man's name is Clarence...  <br /> <br />Nominated for 5 Oscar Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor) \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" has an innocence that transcends sentimentality. The movie's triumph is in practically acknowledging the difficulties and disappointments of human life and at the same time cherishing \\"old fashioned\\" values of Friendship, Sacrifice and Love. Watch the DVD and root for George Bailey, you'd be rewarded by the experience - sincerely guaranteed ! <br /> <br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" - Movie Accolades and Awards <br />> Voted the #1 holiday movie ever in USA. <br />> Ranked #8 in American Film Institute's (AFI) Greatest Love Stories (Titanic is ranked # 37) <br />> Ranked #30 in Internet Movie DataBase's (IMDB) all time Top-250 movies Worldwide (Shawshank Redemption is ranked #2) <br />> Ranked #11 in AFI's Greatest Movies ever (Schindler's List is ranked #9) <br />> 5 Stars (*****) - The highest viewer rating for a movie at www.amazon.com <br /> <br />
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Copy protect this Sony!<br /><br />From the ones that brought us SACD surround (before dropping it, after not promoting it) and SACD playing on their DVD machines (without the ability to play the competition DVD-A surround format):  Sony now presents us with copy protection that also screws around with our computers.<br /><br />Even though I would love to have the surround disc (only 1 of the 2 discs) I think I will skip this one Sony, just like I have passed on your playing equipment.  Pass the Beta, fools!
B0000C8AVE|5.0|What a great thing to find this on CD!  I just bought it. <br /> <br />My dad was born in 1938, and I was born in 1964.  My father was a college history professor since 1963, and retired in '96.  During the Vietnam War era, my father was against the war and pretty far to the left.  Much more recently, he told me that in the 60's, he was very careful about giving a poor student a failing grade, even if they deserved it.  He felt that if the student flunked out that he might have to live with having been instrumental in that student being sent off to war. <br /> <br />My dad is very different today.  Like me, he's pretty far to the right.  I would say that my dad is slightly to the left of G. Gordon Liddy, and I am left of Adolf Hitler.  Needless to say, we both support President Bush today.  Oh,how times change. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to Dylan.  When I was much younger, probably 15 or 16, I found this album in the basement.  The cover was worn and there was no inner sleeve.  But I listened to it.  Once in a while, when I got bored with Jethro Tull and AC/DC, I listened to The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.  It became one of my favorite records.  I didn't quite get the political significance of the songs - I would later - but I recognized somehow that Dylan's words had some significance.  This was musical poetry, and there was a message somewhere. <br /> <br />I still have that record.  And I listened to it as recently as a about a month ago.  My favorites: <br /> <br />Masters of War.  A chilling song.  How can a right-wing extremist in 2005, an owner of numerous guns, love this song?  I don't know, but it gives me goosebumps. <br /> <br />Bob Dylan's Dream.  A song about Dylan waking up during WW III.  \\"...stood a-wonderin' which way to go.  I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.\\" <br /> <br />I guess for me, these songs are an historical record.  When I listen to \\"Masters of war,\\" it takes me to a time when my father was my age, and things were different.... or, were they really that different?  I'm not sure. <br /> <br />I just can't wait to get my new CD.  I'll pop it in the CD player of my new, gas-sucking Trailblazer, and head off to the range to put some brass in the grass. <br /> <br />GET THIS CD!  Whatever your political persuasion, this is a great listen.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is the type of comeback that only fairy tales are made of. Mariah Carey did not disappoint. This is surely one of her best albums. Your Mariah collection would not be complete without it. And to top it off, on November 15 she is re-releasing this great album with 4 exciting new tracks: \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" (Mariah's current single), \\"Makin' It Last All Night,\\" \\"So Lonely (One & Only Part II),\\" and \\"We Belong Together - Remix.\\" She is also including 4 music videos on DVD. Many of the new tracks you may be familiar with and are available for listening on either AOL Music or Rhapsody. So be sure to check out the PLATINUM DELUXE EDITION CD/DVD, an excellent gift for the holidays.     I cannot say enough about Mariah Carey. I feel that her work throughout the years speaks volumes about her as a recording artist. She's an incredible talent and it's great to have her back again making great Pop/R&B songs for everyone to enjoy.    Favorites:    It's Like That  We Belong Together  Mine Again  Stay The Night  I Wish You Knew  Joy Ride  Fly Like A Bird    Don't Forget About Us (Re-release)  Makin' It Last All Night (Re-release)
B00097DXZS|1.0|Message to Carlos Santana: Stop with the collaboration albums! If I want to hear Mary Blige or Joss Stone  I will buy their albums (by the way I won't), so why do we have to have this mediocrity foisted on us through pointless collaborations. Stop trying to please know-nothing radio programmers and reward the loyal followers such as myself with a \\"pure\\" Santana offering.<br />I have been following Santana since Woodstock and have all their CDs but this collabration thing is going too far. Best track by far on this CD is Da Tu Amor, a non-collaborative effort. This shows what the band is capable of when they turn their backs on the detritus that masquerades as today's pop music. If Carlos wants ideas on Cds why not rework Atlanta Rhythm Section's \\"Spooky\\" or better still \\"I Want You\\" from the Beatles Abbey Road. I saw him do this track 20 years ago at a concert and it was just crying out to be recorded.<br />Carlos please stop selling out to your loyal fans.
0380002930|5.0|This is a classic story about a group of rabbits searching for the good life.  It has a surprising amount to say about courage, loyalty, and leadership.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|The cult of Pat will likely come down on me, but I'll put it this way:  Having seen PMG eight times over the past 24 years (twice on the \\"Offramp\\" tour, three times on the \\"We Live Here\\" tour), and Pat with other musicians a time or two, I was almost glad the recent tour passed us by.  I really don't think I would have enjoyed sitting through \\"The Way Up\\" live.  This meandering set never comes together for me -- if you want to check out this gifted composer/guitarist, start with a different record.  I suggest \\"Question and Answer\\" or \\"Secret Story.\\"      update in January 2010--I take it back, sort of.  Recently I rented the Blu-ray of the live performance of \\"The Way Up.\\"  Watching seven guys work together to perform this live was a lot of fun.  Better to see than to hear.
0307276902|5.0|\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is about James Frey's experience in rehab. He shows up as little more than a wasted piece of meat, and with the help of his counselors and friends slowly becomes whole again. Almost. This is an incredibly raw and brutal story, with Frey sparing us nothing in-between late-night detox sickness and root canals without novacaine. As Frey's holes start to heal, as his Fury begins to check itself, and as his self-hatred leads to a gentler understanding of the microcosmic universe surrounding him, the reader is given a very rare reading experience. You cannot help but be impressed at Frey's fortitude in quitting and keeping sober not due to any twelve-step program, but rather to a simple decision to 'hold on' and never start using again. His story is an example of bravery and personal responsibility, and because of the starkness of his tone and the realistic progression of his treatment it is very important reading for anyone having troubles with addiction.
B0002OERI0|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!  This album goes beyond every expectation that I have ever had from Green Day.  From previous listenings, I have not been a big fan of Green Day - a song here and there that I liked, but not enough to buy any of their albums...UNTIL NOW!!  This album is a masterpiece from beginning to end - no filler here.  In fact, I believe it to be the best Alternative album of the year!  If you don't try this album out, then I would have to say you are missing out on a truly wonderful musical experience.<br /><br />Keep up the great work Green Day.  You have gained a new fan who is eagerly anticipating a terrific follow-up to what has to be one of my favorite albums to come along in a long time.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Do NOT purchase this, or any other Sony CD which Amazon has helpfully marked \\"CONTENT / COPY PROTECTED\\" if you plan to attempt to play this back (let alone rip a copy) on your Windows computer. <br /> <br />See the customer reviews for the Van Zant Brothers CD here on Amazon, or search for David Berlind's blog entry from November 1 on ZDNet and Molly Wood's November 3 column on CNet for more details. <br /> <br />One more thing:  If you're reading this too late, do NOT try to remove this malware yourself, unless you are extremely tech savvy.  It will kill your CD drive.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone who has never listened to the wonderful music of Pink Floyd. This was a great movie, it does help in understanding the album a little better. If one were to read the lyrics and pay attention as to what \\"the wall\\" may mean, then the movie would probably make more sense to you. Sometimes you have to do a little bit of research to enjoy things. Everything is not just going to be handed to you. That is the beauty of Pink Floyd, they want you to think about what things mean. In ending, a little fact that people might not know is that Roger Waters had almost total control in making the album and film. The animation sequences are very interesting and vivid and enjoyable even though most of them are violent. The rest of the movie has great visuals as well, but you probably won't appreciate them as much if you haven't listened to the album.<br /><br />The DVD features the following:<br />Audio commentary by Roger Waters and animator Gerald Scarfe<br />\\"The Other Side of The Wall\\" -documentary (on the making of the film)<br />\\"Retrospective: Another Brick In The Wall Parts 1 & 2\\" - 45 minute documentary (featuring almost everyone involved in the film)<br />Deleted scene: \\"Hey You\\" (in DD 5.1, 4.5 minutes)<br />Production stills<br />Design drawings<br />Music video: Pink Floyd - \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\"<br />Theatrical trailer<br />Fold out mini poster<br />Technical Sound System Set Up Guide<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is the kind of movie everyone always thinks I'm going to like, because \\"it's just so wacky, with these really crazy characters!\\"  But I didn't think these characters were funny.  They just seemed like cliches, cliches of wacky, off-the-beaten-path sorts of people. Predictable cliches, like Napoleon's brother being astounded that his grandma gets annoyed at paying for his hours of internet chat time. Napoleon's constant rudeness was really annoying and off-putting, and I didn't see what was funny about him saying \\"sweet\\" or \\"gosh\\" or \\"idiots!\\" all the time.  <br /> <br />The only two funny parts for me were: when the farmer shoots the cow in front of the kid-filled school bus, and Uncle Rico's reaction when Napoleon pelts his van with a grapefruit. <br /> <br />I'm 36 so I think maybe I'm just too old to get this.  Maybe it's like \\"Repo Man\\" was for my generation, I don't know.  I liked \\"Repo Man,\\" but \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" was just not doing it for me.
B000063DI8|5.0|I don't know why some people don't like this one. For me it's a rock n roll masterpiece. Some may complain about the sound of this CD, but to me it makes the album very cool. I can't pick a song that isn't good on this album.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|Update: 2010-12-30    Hmm...interesting. Below is what remains of the review I posted a few years ago. What gives Amazon? Who or what cropped the beginning section out of it?!    Speaking of \\"Houston, we have a problem\\"!    *****************    it is a very good series. I simply don't get that episode---I suppose it was look at how journalism had changed (or was changing) into the worthless condition it now finds itself.     If you're into Apollo, this is a must have. IMO, there's never enough that can be written about this era, and this series does indeed do it justice.
0765348780|2.0|I picked up this book to fill the gap whilst awaiting the new George RR Martin book. I had heard so many good things about this book. The first thing I noticed was that the author seemed to have created a new sub-genre - military fantasy. Just like the numerous military sci-fi books, this book features marines and regiments and legions and battle-mages and such. Seemed intriguing at first, but the more I read, the whole military edge began to annoy me.  <br />The next thing I noticed was the utterly vast array of characters - so many in fact, that I was constantly flipping to the front of the book to read the list of Dramatis Personae. So many characters that I felt or cared absolutely nothing about any of them. Even the \\"supposed\\" main character, Whiskeyjack, was hardly even prevalent compared to the other members of his elite squad of Bridgeburners. <br />The next thing I noticed was that 3/4 through the book, I still had virtually no idea where the story was going or really what it was even about. I like complex, non-cookie-cutter, stories, but this just seemed to be about some vague mission to do...something. <br />And lastly, the thing that ultimately led me to decide to quit reading it altogether were the recurring scenes of gods and mere men interacting with one another - and often the mortals usually besting the gods in either combat or wits or whatever struggle it happened to be on that particular page. This story, I think, basically plays out as a cosmic chess match where numerous gods use mortals as playing pieces. Now I know the term \\"realistic\\" is subjective in fantasy fiction, but the use of gods as walking talking breathing characters right alongside humans just absolutely takes away any realism and reduces it to a book where anything, no matter how ludicrous or contrived, can happen simply because gods are characters. A prime example is the scene that ultimately led me to decide to stop reading when I was almost done. Paran, a military captain, has just defeated a pack of God-Hounds with his God-enhanced sword, Chance. He kneels down to marvel at these awesome dead beasts and gets some blood on his hands. The next thing you know, \\"he fell back into the darkness\\". He wakes up in some other-wordly prison-realm that exists within some other magical sword called Dragnipur. Here, it is a gloomy place with lots of spooky chains rattling. So, of course, Paran yells out \\"Oponn, Dear Twins, I call on you! Now!\\" And just like that, the god of luck appears and Paran and this god have a conversation, and then a struggle, and then ultimately, the god ends up doing what the mortal wants and breaks him out of this prison world. Whaaat? <br />That scene there is, again, the scene that made me quit reading. Just such ridiculousness. And this scene takes place after numerous other god-man interactions. I just couldn't take anymore. (I couldn't finish Neil Gaiman's American Gods either - I guess I just hate books the bring gods in as normal characters.)  <br />Oh, and lets not forget the maniacal, evil, scheming little wooden string-puppet. Ugh! How did this book garner such glowing reviews and be dared to compare to George RR Martin? <br />Anyways, I will not be reading anymore Steven Erickson books. If you want to read a very good fantasy book by a fellow Canadian, try The Darkness That Comes Before by R Scott Bakker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|It would be impossible to add to what's already been written here except to say, if you don't yet own this but desire to, just go buy it already.    And, for a purchase tip: You can occasionally find this at Sam's with the price hovering around the $60 mark. FWIW.    Update 5/10/2006  I just finished watching this whole series again a second time (since 2002). My opinion is stronger than before---this is an absolutely awesome film, and to anyone reading this, if you a lover of history, especially the USA & Europe, then you must own this. Please, buy it for yourself and your children.    On a personal note, I am so thankful that men such as these preceeded me and made it possible to enjoy a wonderful life here in these United States today. Surely, if there is a Heaven, a special place must be reserved there for the Easy Company.
0765340798|4.0|The Battle of Corrin picks up 56 years after The Machine Crusade to find humanity and machines still very much at war. One by one, synchronized worlds and unallied planets are recaptured by Humanity, which leave Omnious and the Cymeks scrambling. The robots counter with a horrific plague unleashed upon unsuspecting humans, effecting virtually all of humanity's inhabited planets. The plague wipes out billions of humans on numerous worlds, tipping the scale of power back to the machines. On most League worlds, half the planets' populations are either dead or dying. Fortunately, there's this unallied planet called \\"Arrakis\\" that produces a highly addictive substance, indigenous to its world, refered to as \\"spice\\" or \\"melange,\\" which, when ingested, cure the symptoms of the plague. Once cured, humanity licks its wounds and continue reconquering the robots, one world at a time, until they finally have the machines narrowed down to one planet: Corrin.
B00081H018|2.0|Wow, I've been a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman's novels for years now, and while I particularly enjoy the Alex Delaware series, until now I've enjoyed his stand alone novels just as much.<br /><br />The only reason I struggled to finish the book was because it was a JK novel, but believe me, it really WAS a struggle. It's possible that some of the reason is that the setting itself is fictional; despite long narratives about the setting and its environs, I still never got a real feel for the area.<br /><br />I also didn't find any of the chracters likeable; whether they are good guys or bad guys, or somewhere in between, I can usually identify with the characters in some way. Like them, hate them, are they funny, smart? I just really didn't CARE.<br /><br />The second star is only because somewhere after page 200, the \\"action\\" started to pick up and make some sense, and THERE was the Jonathan Kellerman writing I've come to love, expect, and respect.<br /><br />Hopefully this was just a fluke. If nothing else, at least it's apparent I'm not the only one who feels this way.
B00097DXZS|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this CD.  It did not play on my computer, so I played it on my CD player and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm amazed with Santana's ability to adapt his guitar playing to the style each song.  Carlos  is simply the best guitar player who ever lived.  The first track is a lively instrumental track entitled Hermes.  I felt that I was dancing at a party when I heard it.  I don't understand a word of Spanish on the track El Fuego, but I really liked the energetic sound of this  track.  I'm Feeling Good is another highlight on this CD. Pop singer Michelle Branch sounds great singing vocals here. My Man is a good R and B cut with Mary J. Blige providing awesome vocals.  Santana's guitar playing is so good on this track.  He really rocks here.  Anthony Hamilton has a smooth soulful voice.  I loved his vocals on the track Twisted.<br /><br />Steven Tyler lends his talent on the track Just Feel Better.  This song is about how a person can become insecure in life about what they want.  There is a honesty in Tyler's voice,  and  Santana accompanies him so well.  Trinity is an excellent instrumental track that proves that Santana does not always need vocals to make great music.  Santana jams with Kirk Hammett and Robert Randolph on this song, and they sound so moving together.<br /><br />I also liked the song Brown Skin Girl. Bo Bice has such a sexy voice, but Santana's superb guitar playing makes this a great rock love song about an amazing girl.  Santana teams up with Los Lonely Boys on the song I Don't Want To Lose Your Love.  I really liked Henry Garza's vocals, and I think his guitar playing together with Carlos sounds mindblowing here.  Santana continues to make great music.  I loved listening to this CD.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|Cryptopsy's latest album is the most hatefully fresh sounding DM album i've heard in awhile. It's brutal in the expected fashion, with Mournier's hyper-drumming as impressive as ever, if not more so and with the return of Lord Worm's frantic & demonic histrionics (x5) is intertwined with the band's usual writing & technical aptitudes. It's heavier than a black hole and it is full of aggression that screams for the bloodletting of angels and deicide. Yet what is the appeal if this all sounds a little too familiar? Cryptopsy has achieved at least two exciting things here: a tighter synthesis of brutality and technicality, yet with wider swings in either diretion; and some of the tracks on this album are very evocative and atmospheric amidst the extreme BRUTALness, far more so than anything on previous albums. Songs like \\"Carrionstine\\", \\"The Curse of the Great\\", and \\"Keeping the Cadaver Dogs at Bay\\" are bound to become classics of the band's repertoire. Extra credit: the last song \\"Endless Cemetary\\" might be the best they've done! Highly recommended... especially the limited edition digipak which is a far more suitable aesthetic complement to the quality of the album.
B00006L90T|4.0|Given its low-budget pedigree, this film is far better than anyone had any right to expect.  Director Herk Harvey, in his only production (!), shows himself to be a master of atmosphere.  There's not much to the story: after a near-death experience, a young woman (Candace Hilligoss) is stalked by ghosts.  She sometimes appears to become invisible to those around her and has a weird attraction to an abandoned resort out in the Utah desert.  I can imagine that this was the perfect drive-in movie; the images are of paramount importance and deliver an eerie experience without the necessity of distracting teenagers from their necking with the need to follow a story.  The film ends with a \\"twist\\" that is very passe today (and probably was in the 60s as well), but by this time Harvey has already delivered plenty of shivers.  Our heroine's mysterious end is a beautifully orchestrated black-and-white nightmare.  What would Harvey have accomplished if he had continued making films...and why didn't he?/
B00005JNTX|5.0|Stunning.  Simply stunning.  SIN CITY is, by far, one of the coolest action thrillers I have ever seen.  Watching it was like being thrown into the dark graphic novels that comprise Frank Miller's world: gritty, dark, bleak, and hostile.  It must have been a monumental task to film, judging from the featurettes included with the DVD.  The actors had to film almost entirely in front of a green screen, allowing the visual effects team to create the most intricate of backgrounds for each shot.  For my eyes, it is the ultimate noir piece.  Due to the computer backgrounds, there is perfect control over the lighting, black & white textures, etc.  Everything is controlled in this film (visually) right down to the smallest detail.  In turn, I think it is safe to say that Director Robert Rodriguez has done the best job of any director at bringing a comic book to the big screen.  This is not a corny adaptation with little men running around in costumes.  Rather than force the comic book world into the theater, the audience is dropped into that world.  The effect is stunning.<br /><br />Yet, despite the fact that the film is visually stunning, it does not rely solely on its effects to make the film.  The acting is quite good.  The entire group is perfectly cast: they seem ripped right out of the graphic novels.  In particular, Bruce Willis seems particularly suited to his role.  He belongs in this world.  But more so than any other actor, Mickey Rourke takes the cake.  He is a great character to open the movie with given that his performance and makeup job instantly set the tone for the entire film.  I hope to see more films working in this style and you'd better believe that Rourke should be at the top of the casting list next time.<br /><br />Even if you've never heard of Frank Miller or are not a fan of traditional action movies, SIN CITY will knock your socks off.  It is very unique and hopefully we haven't seen the last of its kind.  Of course, take my recommendation with a grain of salt: if you are opposed to graphic violence, you might be offended by the film.  Sin City is not the land of \\"It's a Small World After All.\\"mendation with a grain of salt: if you are opposed to graphic violence, you might be offended by the film.

B00097A5HW|3.0|i am not denying that shakira is an amazing performer (just look at the video for la tortura) or has an amazing voice but this album kinda dissapointed me. i know its been ages since her last album but i feel she shud have waited a little longer. <br /> <br /> <br />the labum starts srtong, la pared and la tortura being my favourites, and improved in the remixes. but but there are some songs that just do not appeal to me and feel like they were thrown together in 5 minutes because she realised there wernt enough songs here to make an album.  <br /> <br />the beats in some of these songs really dont match the feel or shakiras voice. 'obtener un si' sounds like a background track off the game \\"the sims\\" and 'escondite ingles' sounds like a haloween tune. <br /> <br />however there are some clasics here that stand very well on their own. if she had waited for some more great songs to come along then this album would have been great, quality over quantity.
0792838068|5.0|LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a truly heartbreaking story about a man, determined to drink himself to death, and the hooker who falls in love with him.  But in case you were thinking it: this ain't no PRETTY WOMAN.  Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue both bring a heavy dose of reality to their respective roles.  Cage oscillates between our sympathy and disgust, refusing to falsely breathe pity into the role.  One of the things that is great about the film is that it flips the plot and moral cards on us.  Normally in a film like this, the \\"Prince Charming\\" who saves the princess from her life of whoring is lifted up as the moral superior, brining life and love into the life of a hooker.  But in LEAVING LAS VEGAS, the hooker becomes the moral exemplar, breathing life and love into the broken life of an alcoholic.  It is a wonderful reversal and I was happy to see it.<br /><br />One of the questions I kept asking myself was: Why is Cage a drunk?  We get some insights into his condition: his wife leaving him and a failed job.  I would have appreciated a bit more back story.  It is interesting to see the degeneration of man, painful as it is, but it would have been more interesting if we had had more understanding of the events that had led to his demise.  Of course, in the end, the backstory does not really matter.  LEAVING LAS VEGAS is not a film about tidying up loose ends.  It is a film that takes us into the depths of despair and then, rather than rescuing us by a Hollywood ending, drops us in the grave and buries us alive.<br /><br />The film score is perfect for the movie.  The jazz music lends the film the romance and sadness that it needs.  Yet, unlike many reviewers, I would not call this a love story.  The \\"love\\" that is here is so muddled by the need of these two persons that it becomes transformed into something else.  It is about two people at the end of their rope, with one dollar in their pocket.  Instead of trying to save the dollar and start over, they decide to spend it and see what happens.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a beautiful film that deserves to be in everyone's library.  I can only hope they do a much better job with the DVD in the near future and give this film the respect it deserves.ecide to spend it and see what happens.

0805047905|5.0|This book is really as great as everyone says.  My 11mos old son absolutely loved it since the first time we read it.
B0007GADZO|3.0|Like his last 2 studio releases, \\"Fire Garden\\" and \\"The Ultra Zone\\", Steve Vai misses the mark with \\"Real Illusions: Reflections.\\"  The ideas behind the songs lack cohesion, and the songs themselves sound thin and digital.  With all due respect to Mr. Vai as a guitar player, he should drop his insistence to sing lead vocals on his albums.  He's just not a good singer, and his voice does not suit the music.  There are exceptions, but not on this album.  If you'd like to hear Vai's singing at its best, check out \\"Aching Hunger\\" or his cover of \\"Celluloid Heroes,\\" but don't waste your time with \\"Dying For Your Love\\" or \\"Brother.\\"  That said, most fans couldn't care less about the vocal songs, yet still greatly appreciate him for his guitar playing.  \\"Building The Church\\" joins other songs like \\"Jibboom,\\" \\"The Audience Is Listening\\" and \\"The Attitude Song\\" as part of a collection of what I consider to be definitive Vai.  However, there's a bit too much shredding on this album, even for long-time fans who have heard it all.  The sweep-picking live outro on \\"Freak Show Excess\\" is meandering and makes just one statement - I can do this, ain't it cool?  No, not really, it's annoying, and not very musical - just because you CAN do something of that sort doesn't mean you SHOULD.  I'm a fan of modern lead guitar playing and have been for 20 years, so it's disappointing to hear Vai sink to new lows such as that, with this album (check out his comment at the end of the track - \\"that's enough of that nonsense!\\"  You said it, Steve!)  What I'd really like to hear would be new, updated studio recordings of various live tracks from Live In An Ultra World (how about Whispering A Prayer, Giant Balls Of Gold and Iberian Jewel?) as well as some more in-depth instrumentals (like The Attitude Song and For The Love Of God)...what I DON'T want to hear is just more of the same; The Ultra Zone was kinda like Fire Garden 2, and now we have Fire Garden 3.    C'mon Steve, you can do better thanthis!  Even his trademark wackiness is not present here (check out his version of \\"Wipeout\\" or \\"F**k Yourself\\") and, though it's exciting that Billy Sheehan is back in the mix, you can't really tell on this record.  The bass is as buried as Mr. Big.  Oh well.  Let's just hope the next one is more on par with what his fans expect of him.  The bottom line?  Vai fans will like it, but not love it...guitar fans probably won't know what to think.
B00008CLNQ|4.0|I have seen a lot of bashing of Karajan's Brahms interpretations, but also a lot of respect. Those who want \\"bold, imaginatively interpreted\\" recordings should look elsehwere. Typically, Karajan gave very straigtforward, hyper Romantic readings and was content to let the music speak rather than getting his fingerprints into every nook and cranny. Considering the beauty of the music presented, I find this approach much more appropriate than say, a Barenboim or a Masur. Karajan's less analytical approach certainly helps with such lyrical music. Just so it's clear, this is lush Brahms - pretty much the opposite of Szell's Brahms - with the edges slightly smoothed as Karajan was wont to do. I personally find this approach excellent for Brahms, but I'm sure there are others who disagree.<br />The Berlin Philharmonic plays magnificently and the recording has an honesty of sound that I have not heard elsewhere.<br />(a note about the recording: DG used a lot, some may say too many, microphones in their late 70s early 80s recordings. The result is an effect you will either really love or really hate. It has a lot of easily audible layers, but to some ears the recordings come off as harsh or dry. I happen to like the sound as I feel it adds lushness, but hey, judge for yourself.)<br />Another bonus is that DG removed that horrendous digital 4th symphony, which really was a disaster. The replacement, an ADD selection, comes from Karajan's last analog 1977/78 cycle. Again, sumptuous recording, with breathtaking crescendos. Basically - if you like Karajan's Brahms, then you should have this set in your collection.<br /><br />Another set to consider is Abbado/Berlin. Truly magnificent, with a better 1st, but much more expensive.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I've got to admit, I was very reluctant to accept Johnny Depp in a revision of Gene Wilder's role of Willy Wonka in the first production.  However, those who have read the book would agree that Wilder's Wonka differed greatly from the white-haired, spry character that Dahl described.  Wilder had his own take on the character, and the same must be said here for Johnny Depp. <br /> <br />Depp is excellent in this role, once you get over the fact that he's quite a bit younger than the WW that Dahl described, and his rather odd haircut!  Those points aside, Depp is very amusing.  For instance, the way he calls the Oompa-Loompas (I won't ruin it for you) and how he'd speak to them (e.g., \\"Take Mr. Teavee down to the taffy puller, k?  Stretch him out!\\" I'm laughing again just thinking about it). <br /> <br />Another very noteable moment involves the re-invented character of Veruca Salt.  The song is gone (\\"don't care how, I want it NOW!\\"), but this Veruca is just as spoiled rotten as the previous.  Veruca's Father has his entire factory searching for a golden ticket, and what does Veruca say to him when he finally obtains one for her and hands it to her?  \\"Oh, thank you, Daddy! I'm so very pleased!\\"?  Or perhaps something like what the original Veruca said - \\"It's about time, too!\\"....Nope, even worse!  Veruca takes the ticket from her father, looks him square in the eye and says, \\"Daddy, I want another pony.\\" BRAT with a capital B! <br /> <br />Excellent remake.  Tim Burton is amazing, and Depp is a great modern actor.  Some movies you buy, watch once, then they sit on the shelf for years.  This one won't.  Besides, Burton is a director worthy of our support.
0385338686|2.0|I took this book with me on the plane, because i had read 'can you keep a secret?' (which i also reviewed, though more favourably than this) it really is chick lit, and although those of you might get a bit technical about how it inaccurately portrays a lawyer, it does the job of allowing you a bit of fluff and as you pass from one stereotypical character to another, amidst the illogical strands of the plot, time whizzes by. personally kinsella should stick to what she knows best, shopping. nonetheless nobody buys this book with the intention of a high brow literatzi novel do they?
0553106635|5.0|\\"A Storm of Swords\\", the third novel in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga, resumes the adventures of earlier characters next to new additions.  Character interaction and internal dialog maintains the excellent storyline quality along with scandalous encounters and political drama.  The series is grim fantasy, filled with brutal and extreme experiences and not for the carefree reader.<br /><br />The plot remains impressive around complex circumstances and multifarious individuals.  Some characters appear to commit great evil yet when examined from another position appears sensible while those of altruistic purposes are forced into controversial decisions.  Major revelations transpire, particularly those concerning events from the first novel.  Mysterious creatures and magic continues to develop at an acceptable level within the series.<br /><br />A greater assortment of major and minor characters, from lords to stable boys, requires a more detailed appendix, perhaps a section in alphabetical order.  Some portions of the map could have incorporated further detail especially the continents where the story relates.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
0143034901|4.0|Reading this book requires amazing spans of concentration, not because the language is trying to be avant-garde or modern noir or anything, but the plot just flips inside itself, tossing you up in the air only to be caught backwards by the same person!<br /><br />It follows the life of Daniel, who discovers a novel by Carax, however he's not the only one who wants it, a man, face half hidden in shadows roams around burning all carax's books and desperately wants this one. A potential thriller it then turns to a 'coming of age' development novel as Daniel discovers girls and forms new friends. It is filled with wonderful little epithets, from the very first sentence of the novel, to 'there are worse prisons than words'...<br /><br />I'm a little reluctant though to give it five stars, it is at times awkward, perhaps some of the magic was lost in translation, i am willing to give him the benefit of that doubt. however this just makes you wonder, how many lost gems are there, living in their own cemetary of books (read the book, then you'll understand this literary reference!) that haven't been translated into english.<br /><br />anyway, i deviate, the novel is like a more mature 'nancy drew' detective search as Daniel and his new found friends try to unravel the mystery of Julian Carax. It is a novel of friendship, love and literature - the perfect cocktail, but you must read each word, otherwise you will miss the wonderful pearls of wisdom and hidden meanings.
0439679958|5.0|I have read the Alex Rider series (amazing series, Ark Angel coming out 4/20/06, looks great)and was expecting great from this book, I got it. This is an execellent book with a suspenseful and creepy storyline. The only problem I had with this book  is that I wanted to learn more about the Old Ones, or at least for the king to come out and wreak havoc. Hope they will have that in their next book Evil Star. I also hope that Matt (or whoever it will be) will be better with their powers. Overall this book was great.
B00005JO1G|3.0|Everyone has seen the Jarhead trailer with \\"Jesus Walks\\" pounding in the background of some nice visuals, Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko was GREAT) and Jamie Fox (Academy Award Winner).    \\"I think God for every day he gives me in the Corp. Hurrah.\\"    This movie trailer drew me in and made this movie a must see. So on opening night I was there and began watching, with HIGH expectations, Jarhead. The first 40 minutes or so are entertaining and very reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket.     However, once the movie gets into the actual plot or message or whatever it was supposed to be, it falters tremendously. Don't get me wrong, I thought the acting was GREAT and the visuals were absolutely stunning (vast nothingness and burning oil fields). In those two areas the movie was a top notch effort. But, that made this movie so much more dissapointing because it had SO much potential.    The directing (or maybe it's the screenplay) is really the low point of this film becuase the message behind the whole film is extremely sketchy at best. By the end of the film I felt like I had just watched something that may have contained something truly profound, but I had no clue what that was.    As for those who claim this movie is left-wing propaganda, etc., etc., I would like to remind you this is a story as told by one soldier with one perspective.     Overall, this film has some really nice cinematic moments; but in the end, it does not achieve anything else.
0679745203|4.0|For many, an excellent novel establishes connections with its reader either through character development or from the adversities that the characters face. In the case of The English Patient, however, the prose Michael Ondaatje chose to employ hampers any such bonds from being made. The plot and the unique way that Ondaatje goes about telling it makes for an interesting read, but not a captivating one. <br /> <br />The interactions between the characters in the villa also bring little in the way of descriptions. The characters are so jaded that they merely journey from one place to another reminiscing about their past. Even the interactions between Caravaggio and Hana, the pair who used to be childhood friends is short and halting. An excerpt dealing with Caravaggio's hands demonstrates this succinctly as it ranges from, \\"I would remove those bandages on your hands. I am a nurse, you know.\\" To half a page later spiraling into nostalgia with, \\"It is a strange time, the end of the war.\\" \\"Yes. A period of adjustment.\\" \\"Yes.\\" <br /> <br />The sacrifice of the character development is not entirely in vain, however, as it allows the use of a skillfully done method of introducing and advancing the plot. Ondaatje paces the book in superb form to heighten the mysteries surrounding the English Patient and his past. At times it makes a somewhat unwieldy appearance, but the reader is relentlessly driven on to wonder who or what the patient really was. <br /> <br />I would only recommend this book to anyone who has a large amount of time so that they are able to engross themselves completely into the winding plot and the various intrigues of each character's past. If read casually the general haze that surrounds the characters will most likely detract from the experience as a whole and ruin the book entirely. <br />
B000A3DFZE|2.0|I bought Back Home without listening first, purely on the faith that this is an Eric Clapton record, ergo some level of quality and interest, and possibly greatness, was in store. <br /> <br />But...in a word...NO!! <br /> <br />I was shocked by the syrupy, drippy orchestration and sappy girl vocals.  I was stunned by the low level of song writing and the banal, trite lyrics.  I was horrified that my hero had fallen into a pit of steaming...something.  I was kind of ticked that I had just paid good money for it.  And most of all, I was really disappointed to not be able to listen to some great new Eric Clapton music, because it just ain't here. <br /> <br />Haaahhh.  Deep sigh exhaling.  I shouldn't take it out on Eric, because he's just trying to make musical records, which has to be one of the most harrowing jobs in the world.  Think of it.  Let's say you -- not him, you -- have come up with some brilliant idea, a book or picture or poem or whatever, that becomes a great hit.  Then for the next 40 years everyone expects you to match or exceed your best effort, and if you don't you get panned and kicked around in places like the Amazon reviews.  I'm glad I don't have to go through that.   <br /> <br />This album is a bust, IMHO, but Clapton certainly isn't.  There are reviewers here on Amazon who say he never did anything; they betray their ignorance.  I saw one person gripe that Clapton's biggest hits were written by other people.  Umm, ever hear of Frank Sinatra, or Tony Bennett, who never wrote any songs?  Clapton wrote all-time classic songs, songs you know from the first three notes, but he's also gifted enough to bring other's songs to prominence.   <br /> <br />Clapton is human.  He's mortal, he's fallible.  We must forgive him mistakes like this album, because he has given us such brilliant music and artistry over the years, and has put himself on the line for his art, unlike so many pretenders out there. <br /> <br />I recommend passing on this CD, but I'll wait eagerly for Eric's next effort.
B000ASDFJU|4.0|When I started dating my (now ex) girlfriend, I had never previously seen the phenomenom known as Sex and The City. Little did I know that I was now dating a obsessive fan of the show. Over the 8 monthes we dated I had seen every episode that the series had to offer. From Mr. Big to The Russian. From the elegant and stylish Trey, to the homely but amazing divorce lawyer Harry Goldenplatt (sp?). As much as it pains me to admit, this show did have entertaining value, even for a man.    The way I see it, the series was at its best in it's final season. Thing's were finally starting to fall into place for these four woman. Samantha's bout with cancer was an emotional, yet inspiring moment in the shows history. Over the years, the charachters really developed a nice depth to them that really gave you something to grasp onto.    Though, some of the story lines were a little to extravagant, even for NYC single woman. And the games that these people play in there relationships becomes a little to much to bare at times, especially with some of the endings being very generic and predictable.    Even though the show may be slighty slanted to the sympathy of woman, it still serves a good way to entertain. It's something that both you and your boyfriend/girlfriend can enjoy while cuddling with eachother in front of your TV, as long as you are able to laugh at the ridicoulous hijinks that occur in relationships.    If you havn't seen the show before, I wouldn't go out and buy the whole series until you know if you like the show or not. This isn't the sort of show to take someone else's opinion about. Some people love it and some hate it, and sure, theres the few that are neither impressed or disgusted, but at least watch a few episodes before buying the whole lot.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I loved the Warriors when it was released but had not seen it for many years.  Watching this new release, I was a little concerned whether or not it would hold up over time.  I must confess that the fight scenes aren't quite as gritty or intense by today's standards and the music is almost funny it is so synthesized.  But the movie is still very entertaining.  Watching the Warriors fight their way home using brains at least as much as brawn is a great ride.    What is not great is the new Director's Cut edition which treats us to yet another director \\"improving\\" a film that should have been left alone.  Why anyone would think that adding in comic book page transition scenes would make the film better is a mystery to me.  Every time they come up on screen, they jar you out of the story and disrupt the flow of the movie.  Seriously, it's like something from a bad high school film project.    I would givethe Warriors 4 stars as a film because it is a good (but not great) film.  It's entertaining and holds up reasonably well even after all this time.  But I am forced to deduct 1 star for the director desecrating the movie with the ridiculous comic book transitions.  I hope that someday directors will learn to let the movies they have made stand on their own merits.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|<br />Director/co-writer Christopher Nolan has done two movies I admire very much:  MEMENTO and INSOMNIA.  With BATMAN BEGINS he works with co-writer David S. Goyer to explore Batman's roots.  Goyer apparently did a first draft, then passed it on to Nolan for polishing because Goyer knew more about comic books.  The movie is based largely on three DC comic stories: \\"The Bat-Man,\\" \\"The Man Who Falls\\", and \\"The Long Halloween.\\"  These comic stories are actually included in the deluxe dual DVD as a nice bonus. <br /> <br />BATMAN BEGINS is so long and complex that I needed two viewings to like it.  A first viewing left me confused and sorry I bought the DVD.  Not helping matters is a bonus disk that has featurettes as Easter Eggs hidden inside comic strip panels.  They are interesting and made the film coherent for me, but were hard to find.  I went back to the movie a second time the next night and loved it.  The first hour or so has Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) on a seven year quest in the Himalayas for inner peace after witnessing the murder of his parents when he is ten years old.  He also falls down a well full of bats when he is a child, and childhood friend Rachel has to rescue him.  These are all flashbacks, with a strong and interesting good-bad performance by Liam Neeson as a martial arts expert.  Location filming for the Himalayas was done in Iceland, which has a rugged top of the world feel. <br /> <br />The cast here is huge.  Bale is a perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman, full of both anger and disillusionment.  The actor apparently did a lot of his own stunts.  Rachel will grow up to be lovely Katie Holmes (DAWSON'S CREEK) and work in the D.A.'s office.  Gary Oldman is unrecognizable and magnificent as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Caine is butler Alfred.  Alfred is also the unofficial caretaker of Wayne Manor, along with Morgan Freeman as Lucius.  Lucius invented the batsuit and batmobile, and controls Wayne Manor.  But it gets a bit confused because RutgerHauer is chief financial officer of the estate until Bruce Wayne fires him at the end.  And Tom Wilkinson (IN THE BEDROOM) is a formidable Mafia don.  The second half of a 140 minute movie has Batman fighting for truth and justice in a violent world; the movie is rated PG-13. <br /> <br />BATMAN BEGINS is a technical masterpiece, with constant night for night aerial cityscapes with lights everywhere, a very busy and noisy soundtrack, and a lot of rain.  Nathan Crowley was the brilliant production designer and apparently designed set models in the same house where Nolan and Goyer were collaborating on the script, which must have been very convenient.  The cinematographer for a Panavision movie is Wally Pfister, whom I have never heard of.  A bonus feature shows how Gotham City was built almost to scale inside a huge and abandoned London factory eight blocks long.  Some of its action set pieces, including batmobile-car-monorail chases, are just stunning.  And the dialogue is wonderful for them:  \\"He's not ON a street, he's driving on ROOFTOPS!\\" \\"Well, at least tell me what he LOOKS like.\\"  The editing, by Lee Smith, is sensational as Batman flies or drives all over the brightly lit night city and says poignant lines like \\"I don't have the luxury of friends.\\" <br /> <br />This new BATMAN movie may be the best yet in terms of taking everything seriously, treating it as realistically as possible with the material, and being intelligent.  There are no over-the-top villains here, no Nicholson as the Joker or DeVito as the Penguin.  Again, it is a movie I hated on one viewing, did not understand at all and found long and boring.  But it came alive for me on a second viewing with help from the bonus second disk, which I was also ready to give up on.  But be patient, my friends, and you will be rewarded. <br /> <br />BATMAN BEGINS is an excellent comic book adventure for adults, and I look forward to reading the 75 page comic book included with the double DVD set. I guess whether you want to actually buy this movie depends on how badly you want this included comic book; the alternative is to just rent it and watch it twice.  But I believe there is also a single disk edition with no bonuses.  Whichever you choose, be sure to get it in widescreen format to see all of Gotham City. <br /> <br />
0156027321|4.0|This was a wonderful read and really thought provoking.  It had some great twists and turns to it.  I do agree that it dragged just a bit in the middle but when it picked back up it was a smooth read to the end.  I thought it was an interesting twist in the end for Pi to give 2 stories as to what happened.  And I am sure there were some hidden things in the book that would take a second read for me to really get.  I would recommend this book to anyone. Not to long and really kept my attention
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series is so great for those of us that like Sci-fi, that it makes it sad to know that it is over.  As you watch action, comedy and flirting in it, it becomes like family and want to keep watching. As you reach the last episode one can only wonder and hope that hollywood continues the series sometime.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|Bought this and 8 hours later read about the 4 disk set to be released on Nov 30.  Kind of rediculous to make 3 different collectors editions isn't it.  The 4 disk set has the trailers, the heart of the ocean documentary, and 3 parodies not in the 3 disk set.  Nevertheless, eventually there's going to be a HDTV edition which is going to blow these DVD sets away. <br /> <br />Watching the deleted scenes initially can be gutwrenching.  They're all the stupid parts of the original script.  After getting back into the state of mind you were in in 1998, they become more bearable, providing the extra bit of Titanic immersion you could never achieve in 1998.  There are some nice special effects shots dropped from the movie. <br /> <br />In 1997, it was a real dissapointment to discover this movie never really happened but was made on a movie set in Mexico.  It was so realistic and convincing you thought it must have been made in an actual ship at sea.  The DVDs assure us that although it was a Mexican movie studio, what you saw were complete replicas of Titanic's rooms with enclosed cielings and walls, and the same building materials used on the original ship, much closer to reality than traditional movie sets.  Furthermore, some of the scenes were really shot on the open ocean.  That assuaged a lot of the grief.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I received this CD as a gift from a friend who used to work in the radio biz and is a BIG music fan. He absolutely raved about this album.  Umm, okAYYYYYYY, I thought. I accepted the cd somewhat grudgingly, thinking my friend had lost his touch. My only knowledge of John Mayer was the song Your Body is a Wonderland. \\"Pop fluff\\" I thought. I had heard that song about a gazillion and a half times on the radio and quite frankly, I was sick of it!<br /><br />So it actually took me a while before I even decided to listen to this CD. I can't tell you how wonderfully surprised I was the first time I listened to it. And everytime I listen to it, I like it even more. This is a truly personal, heartfelt album by an incredibly talented young man. I just love his velvety voice and intelligent lyrics --  obviously someone wise beyond their years.<br /><br />I especially love the song 3x5. It's my absolute favourite.  (Ok, I confess. I hit 'repeat' when that song comes on. I just can't hear it often enough.)  The best of the bunch, as far as I'm concerned. Everytime I hear it, I am floored.<br /><br />Normally, I would give this album 5 stars. I am only giving it 4 stars because I think the best is yet to come.<br /><br />Give this album a try (Hey, I did! ) and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Thanks John!! I'm looking forward to the next one.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this album. The best tracks are, actually I like all of them other than the songs \\" o Green world\\" and \\" Every plant is dead\\" <br /> <br />Overall it's a really good album.
B00004ZD69|5.0|I first heard GY!BE at three in the morning listening to Canadian college radio over the internet - a friend had a slot on the campus station of York U, and I was going to hear his inaugural show even if it meant going to class on no sleep at all the next day. <br />GY!BE made that night worth it to me. Halfway through \\"The Dead Flag Blues\\" (on F#A#&#8734;) I was asking \\"dear God, what am I listening to? This is amazing.\\" I picked up F#A#&#8734; soon after, and demanded their other albums for Christmas. Christmas night I laid there, just letting this all wash over me. It's my policy that the first time I hear an album it must be straight through and without interruption. <br /> <br />That's really the only way to listen to Skinny Fists. <br /> <br />I'm guilty of picking it apart, of course. My playlists are always on shuffle. I don't always have an hour and a half - though I try and find that time when I can. \\"Sleep\\" is probably getting played three times as much as the other songs on this album. (I love the monologue at the beginning; the sadness in the man's voice when he says \\"Things change. They don't sleep anymore on the beach.\\") But when I need to settle in to do a painting or create something, Skinny Fists is the album I turn to. I'm doing NaNoWriMo this month. In the past week I've called upon this album to help me pull my feelings out onto the page at least once a day. <br /> <br />Skinny Fists is, in a word, a masterpiece. It's not music for our fast-paced world, or for a listener with a 4-minute attention span, but it is worth every second you invest in it.
B000002VQQ|5.0|I saw Patti read poetry alone. I saw Patti & Lenny at St. Marks Church. I saw Patti, Lenny & Richard at Max's. I was there at her last gig at the Academy of Music before a long hiatus. I rejoiced at her comeback performance at the Ritz after Fred \\"Sonic\\" Smith's passing. I saw Patti so often she once told me at a CCNY poetry reading, \\"You've seen me more than my manager!\\"  All that I love about rock & roll is embodied in \\"Horses.\\" When I listen I hear the Shangrilas in her girl-group vocals. Early Stones with Brian Jones in her swagger. Hardly ever do poetry and 3-chord rock marry so seamlessly. When she intones, \\"Suddenly, Johnny, gets the feeling, he's surrounded by horses, horses, horses...do you know how to pony?\\" it still makes my heart beat faster. Patti Smith is the original Riot Grrrl. The first woman, after Grace Slick, to not be a \\"my man done left me\\" victim. She hit a home run out of the ballpark with this record, uneclipsed even 30 years later. I still listen to everything she records, and see her & the band as often as they play live. She set the bar high. It hasn't dated in all these years.
6305291446|4.0|Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode in this fast-paced sequel. <br /> <br />This movie basically is about Laurie Strode and what she has done with her life since 1978, now living in California with her son John played by Josh Hartnett. She has changed her name to Keri Tate and has a new boyfriend Will Brennan play by Adam Arkin. While she deals with her haunted past, she has to deal with her teenage son who is going through a life of his own, with his girlfriend Molly played by Michelle Williams, and his two other friends Sarah and Charles (two characters who are only in the movie to die) played by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Adam Hann-Byrd. <br /> <br />There is a great cameo by Janet Leigh, not only Jamie Lee Curtis's mother but also the star of the classic movie Psycho. LL Cool J also makes a good appearance, i was going to call him the worst actor alive, but i like his performance a lot better then i like Busta Rhymes in Halloween: Resurrection. Also a great appearance is Nancy Stephens, who was in the first and second Halloween, great to see her again. <br /> <br />This story eliminates Halloween 4-6, which i don't mind at all. However, i didn't like the way Michael Myers was portrayed. I felt his character should have been made stronger, because even in the first and second Halloweens, he had almost unlimited strength, and in H20, they don't display that. But the one good thing is that Michael finally walks like a human again, because in the last three sequels he was kind of like a robot. The mask changing in some scenes didn't bother me, i'm just glad they later told us why that happened. <br /> <br />I was proud of the opening credits, because just hearing the Halloween theme on strings and back to piano instead of the keyboard and guitar they did on Halloweens 4-6 really amazed me and sounded wonderful. Also, i liked hearing that speech from Halloween 1, and even though it wasn't really Donald Pleasance really doing that speech for H20, it gave the opening credits flare and a lot of power. <br /> <br />It is hard to watch this movie and not remember Donald Pleasance, because even though this was a good movie, that was the thing that was missing, i can only imagine how much better this sequel would of been if Donald Pleasance was in it, instead of 4 stars, it would have got a perfect 5. <br /> <br />My Favorite Scene(s)- Laurie and Michael in the Cafeteria, where Michael is flipping over the tables, one of the only scenes that shows his strength and i thought it was a good scene. Another scene, was the scene before the cafeteria, when Laurie stabs Michael with an Axe, even though a short scene, i loved it, it shows John Carpenters original story behind the Michael Myers character, where he is human but he is force that can't be stopped (quoted from the Halloween 25th anniversary DVD). <br /> <br />Best Kill(s)- Sarah's death, leg gets smashed, and she is hung on a light, for some reason, i liked that scene. Another great death was Will's death, bringing back a murder from Halloween 2 where Michael stabs a person in the back and lifts them off the ground, but H20 really made it look more realistic. <br /> <br />Overall- a great sequel, with its flaws of course, but a 4 out of 5.  <br /> <br />DVD Extras- They are alright, not exactly what i was expecting, just basically a brief on the making of this movie and future plans for the series, and a few other small things like trailers.
0345457684|4.0|For me this was a first as I am neither a fan of sci-fi nor crime writing but.....I have to take my hat off to Mr Morgan as this was most definately the best novel I've read all year. He's changed my mind about both genres and I'm eager to get my teeth sunk into Broken Angels. Great read no matter what your tastes !
B00008ADPF|1.0|Nickelback churn out release after release of poor derived pop rock dribble. There is nothing new from the band, no new angle, no change. It's precisely the same monotonous punchy chord guitar playing, grainy whiney vocals and horribly clich&eacute;d lyrics that featured on previous albums.<br /><br />What makes Nickelback all the more insulting is the undeserved popularity. I was over in Canada a little while ago and on one of their rock stations a poll took place, their `rock world cup', this match up was Nickelback vs Pearl Jam, and you guessed it, Nickelback stormed it. Such an insult to Pearl Jam, an original band that Nickelback completely rip the sh*t off.<br /><br />Quite simply Nickelback's music is mediocre, there's nothing worth listening to. Do yourself a favour and listen to some original guitar driven rock, par example `Soundgarden', `Alice In Chains' or `Pearl Jam'.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This excellent CD is an outstanding value and a must-have for every Buffy fan. All Buffy fans know that \\"Once More With Feeling\\" from season six was possibly the most outstanding and original episode of Buffy ever, but who would have ever thought that the tunes from this musical episode would be so \\"catchy\\" and memorable? In particular, James Marsters, Amber Benson, and Anthony Stewart Head showed themselves to have outstanding vocal abilities.<br /><br />Actually only the first 19 tracks and the very last track are from the musical. The additional material is from some other \\"very special episodes\\" of Buffy. Track 20 is music from \\"Restless\\", which was the season four finale involving the scoobies dreaming. Track 21 is music from the very scary \\"Hush\\" in which \\"The Gentlemen\\" steal the voices of Sunnydale residences and then go about stealing hearts - literally. Track 22 is the music from \\"The Gift\\" in which Buffy jumps to her death in her sister's place to save the world. It's great being able to relive these episodes in my car via music when it would be impractical (and unsafe for that matter) to watch the actual episodes.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is one of the best and strangest foreign movies that i have ever seen!!!!!! This movie is so breath taking that its hard really to describe the movie so if i was you go out and rent it or better yet add it to your movie collection!!!!!! The settings are very real you feel like you are in France and even though you have to use your subtitle for this movie its totally worth seeing this awesome foreign movie!!!!!! Beautifully done with great and visually images throughout the whole movie so go out and either rent or buy but its worth the time to check this movie out!!!!!
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|im a huge fan of final fantasy, and 7 in particular... so when i was informed that a film final fantasy film was in production i was exstatic. After viewing the film though, i must say i am very dissapointed. Sure the visuals are unparalled and the score is up there with epics such as star wars, but jesus christ what went wrong with the plot. it seems that the main reason of the film is to cram as much reference from the game as possible to keep the fans happy. the story is confused and the action scenes are completely over the top. it was nice to see my favourite characters from the game in 2 minute cameos though. This had the potential to be huge. pity...roll on dirge of cerebus.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Kubrick believed, as lots of people during the 60s, that it sufficed to be unlucky enough to have one mad guy in a position of power to trigger a nuclear world. To warn public opinion about that risk he made this hillarious movie with a clear message.  <br /> <br />Humour meets geopolitics, mad people meet each other, and Murphy's law apply also to nuclear deterrence: what can go wrong ends going wrong. <br />
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin are easily my favorite band, along with probably  other millions of people. This is also their most successful album and for good reason. This isn't my favorite album by them, but i thought i should write a review on it since i've listened to this so many times in my life, i know every lyric, and it's been a good inspiration. <br />1.Black Dog 8/10...Never been a favorite. Just a radio staple average rock song. <br />2.Rock N' Roll 8/10...Along with the previous, just a fun rocker with very good drumming from John. <br />3.Battle Of Evermore 10/10...A very folksy beautiful III-esque song. This features some gorgeous female vocals and it feels like something out of Lord Of The Rings. One of my favorites. <br />4.Stairway To Heaven 10/10...Nothing is needed to be said about this track that already hasn't been said. Great stuff. <br />5.Misty Mountain Hop 9/10...A very pleasant surprise on this one. Judging by the title, I didn't know what to expect with this song, but the heavy drums blend great with the keyboard. <br />6.Four Sticks 9/10...Alot of people don't like this song, but i personally think it's great. The bass and guitar are so low or \\"heavy\\" in the verses, but hence the title, this song is all about the drums. <br />7.Going To California 9/10...Another folksy ballad, and yet another beautiful one. This song is where Robert Plant really shines. <br />8.When The Levee Breaks 10/10...One of Zep's heavier songs. One of my favorite songs of all time, with an extremely low bass and John sounds like he's hitting through the bass and snare drum every time he comes down he's hitting so hard. What an amazing piece. <br /> <br />So as the other 800 some odd reviewers say, this is 'the album.' <br />Every song on this album recieved excess radio air play and that could be good or bad. That's not the point though, even if this isn't their best stuff, everyone needs this album.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Yes, Sahara does take place in the same universe as the monumental flop Raise the Titanic, a universe where the Titanic sunk in one piece. Keep your eyes open during the opening credits and you'll see a newspaper clipping of the ship being towed into New York.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey takes over the role of Dirk Pitt from Richard Jordan (whoever he is) and teams up with Steve Zahn and Penelope Cruise for a film that should offer much more action and excitement than Raise the Titanic offered. It's doesn't really succeed.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordino are professional divers/explorers who sneak off from their ordinary salvage duties to find a legendary ship packed full of treasure in a warn-torn part of Africa. Penelope Cruz is a W.H.O. doctor (I could have made a joke there) investigating a series of mysterious deaths and ends up on the wrong side of a local dictator/warlord. Naturally Pitt saves her and is rewarded with loads of foot-soldiers out to kill him.<br /><br />The treasure hunt/ecology plot could have been entertaining but nothing really amazing happens. It could have worked as an Indiana Jones-lite but it's completely free of any of the iconic or classic scenes that make that franchise so famous. What we get is a lightweight James Bond kind of film with no real edge or excitement. The anonymous direction doesn't help either and the whole thing seems to drag along rather than being a breathless ride.<br /><br />None of this is the fault of the actors. McConaughey and Zahn are watchable as always, though I would have liked to have seen William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo given more to do. Since, I've never read any of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels I cannot compare but whoever adapted the novel of Sahara into the screenplay forgot to put anything resembling spectacle or epic into it.<br /><br />Sahara is good for a single viewing only. There's nowt in here that make you come back for more. Which is rather worrying since Paramount bought the rights to 3 of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. They ought to make them better than this, but it's still superior to the similarly plotted National Treasure.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with not-too-spectacular Dolby 5.1 sound design.nt bought the rights to 3 of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels.

B000002N2Z|5.0|These are some of the adjectives i've seen used to describe this album. Toss them out the window. I don't like when this album is overanalyzed and seen as \\"their rough debut.\\" I don't classify this album any different than that of their 3 ladder cd's. This is just as good as those. This is a bit heavier but no less great. <br />1.Bored 9.5/10...One of their first hits ever, and this sounds alot like what was to come. With whisper to singing verses and screaming choruses. Great song. <br />2.Minus Blindfold 10/10...This is a new favorite. I never really listened to this song full through or never really payed attention when it was on, boy was i missing a treat. This song is great. <br />3.One Weak 8.5/10...This is a tad slower and a decent song. Doesn't grab my attention too much. <br />4.Nosebleed 8/10...Most people hate this song, and yes it does sound a bit like korn. But hey, i like korn, so i'm fine with that. Very heavy, but my favorite part is in the middle when the music stops and keeps coming back. <br />5.Lifter 9/10...Alot like One Weak, but better. A softer song throughout until the end when it explodes. <br />6.Root 8.5/10...One of the more \\"Nu-Metal\\" songs on the cd. I personally like the chorus alot, but this song is just pretty good. <br />7.7 Words 10/10...One of my favorites. This song has a funky kind of verse with a blistering heavy chorus. Then the bridge in the middle is priceless. <br />8.Birthmark 10/10...Another great song. This one reminds me of something that could be found on their self-titled. I love this song. <br />9.Engine No. 9  8.5/10...Alot of rapping in this one. Probably the heaviest on the cd. A little much at times but still a good song. <br />10.Fireal 10/10...Yet another one of my favorites. I like the second half of the song better than the first, but running in at 6:35, this song is a treat. <br />11.Fist 9/10...This is Chino's cure influence kicking in. A totally misleading track, extremely quiet and soft. And when you canhear Chino's voice, it's beautiful. <br /> <br />So don't think just because it's not overproduced or wasn't very successful doesn't mean it's great. I love popping in this and just enjoying good ole' Deftones.
B00005V9HA|3.0|Herbert West (the man who's's mansion you battle through in the Splatterhouse video games) is an amoral and rather eccentric Doctor studying at the Miskatonic University (the very institution which sent a doomed expedition to the Mountains of Madness) in Arkham, Massechusetts. He has created a serum which can bring the dead back to life. Only there's a problem, the longer the subject has been dead, the more violent and murderous his resurrection will be.<br /><br />Teaming up with a reluctant fellow student they experiment on twice dead cats and then onto real people. But the sleazy Doctor Hill finds out and muscles in on the action only to be slaughtered by West, who decapitates him with a spade.<br /><br />Out of pure curiosity, West brings the head and body back to life as two separate entities. And Hill continues to screw with West's work, despite having to carry around his own head most of the time.<br /><br />Despite being very well made for the budget it was made on, Re-Animator doesn't have much going for it outside of energetic performances and a real enthusiasm for horror too rarely seen these days. There is no plot and events in the film only seem to happen to shock us or lead into yet another gore scene.<br /><br />And there lies another problem. The filmmakers are keen to give us loads of gore and entrails and while they may be gross the first time round, by the second viewing you'll be disappointed at how tame it really is. No horror is implied or suggested. The only horror there is is that which is shown on screen. The indignity of not being able to rest in peace is never once considered and the murderous corpses are not all that scary.<br /><br />Richard Band's score is nothing more than just alright too. It has an urgent sound to it but doesn't do much for the film and is completely free of melody or theme. In fact I'd argue that it's just the same cue played over and over.<br /><br />The makers are keen to make it as best as they can and you can tell that they had a blast making it. But it's just not even up to standards the genre had been set by films like Evil Dead. And, speaking of Evil Dead, the Necronomicon (according to H.P. Lovecraft) is located in the library of Miskatonic University. Why didn't Doctor West just use that to bring the dead back to life? Despite being a bit above mediocre, I still look forward to the sequel and I must say that Jeffrey Combs is brilliant as West. You can always rely on him to creep you out.<br /><br />Filmed on 35mm in standard widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 the anamorphic DVD looks as good as a 20 year old film can be. The color schemes of the film are rather drab and it lacks the gloss of a modern production, but it's still a good transfer. The sound has been remastered in Dolby/DTS 5.1 and is also quite good despite not being a sound effect heavy film. The original mono track is included too. Also featured on the DVD are loads of interviews with the director, producer, screenwriters, composers and editior of Fangoria as well as deleted/extended scenes and the usual trailers.t not even up to standards the genre had been set by films like Evil Dead.

B0000AXE8I|1.0|I just don't get it.  Is good movie Sci-fi defined by too many computer generated special effects and Kung-Fu fightin'?  This is just an awful movie, with an awful story line, based on an awful premise.  You have the directors recreation of some kind of Dante's Inferno.  Keanu Reaves delivering his lines like some bad robot in the Hall of Presidents or some dime wax museum.  Add to that his wearing that cassock.  And the cheap Superman pose as he flys throught the air is hilarious.  Laurence Fishburne delivers his lines in speech mode.  Did I tell you there is Kung-Gu fightin?  And more Kung-Fu fightin' and so on and so on, well you get it.  Add to this the pseudo Eastern philosophy peppered with Christian terminology and the dialogue is just too taxing. Even worse is that you can see that many of the fight scenes are just computer animation.  I can't go on, this movie is just too awful.  I say take away all their computers until the write a good story and real Science Fiction.
B00006J9OT|3.0|I ordered this CD after seeing all of the glowing reviews here and was really disappointed.  I love the sound of Diana Krall's voice but there is far less of it on this CD than I would expect.  Many of the songs have more instrumental solos than there is singing.  Long instrumental solos then lead to applause that is expected on a live recording but not over top of Diana singing.  Overall a disappointment, I like to listen to any great instrumental but I bought this as \\"Diana Krall Live\\" In Paris not the orchestra.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|NB: As is Amazon's Wont, they've very unhelpfully bundled all the reviews for various editions and formats together.<br /><br />THE DIRECTOR'S CUT<br /><br />Kingdom of Heaven was probably my favorite film of last year, and the 194-minute director's cut gives the film more room to breathe, but it won't make converts of the unbelievers. Instead, it's a more leisurely paced version of the film for the faithful who liked the theatrical cut and want to revisit its world and characters in a little more detail. Closer in style and tone to sixties roadshows than Scott's Gladiator, and all the better for it, in many ways it's the richest and most ambitious of the recent batch of epics. It's more of a journey in the extended version, and a bloodier one (the added violence will please the gore hounds), although there are a few moments that tip over into self-indulgence and could have been tightened or omitted entirely.<br /><br />The extended opening allows more character detail, but at the expense of more of Michael Sheen's caricatured greedy priest, now revealed as Balian's brother. Orlando Bloom's limitations are also given a little more room than they had in the theatrical cut, but he certainly never stoops to the lows of Gerard \\"I'm wonderful, me\\" Butler in Beowulf, Colin Farrell's Alexander or Clive Owen's truly catastrophic non-performance in King Arthur that left that film with a void at its center. Edward Norton's performance as the Leper King suffers a little from using different takes than the theatrical version, and at least one of his expanded scenes is simply longer without really being any better than its equivalent in the shorter version. The real winner in the extra footage stakes is Eva Green, who I think I'm falling in love with and whose part is considerably expanded and much more complex, allowing her a mass of contradictory motives (few of them noble), impulses and emotions that were smoothed away in the theatrical version. The subplot involving her sonalso helps add more of an emotional charge to Baldwin's death, with the shot of his leprous face no longer gratuitous but essential. In fact, in this version of the film, there are even a couple of genuinely touching sequences.<br /><br />While the added complexity in this cut is more in the characters than in the plot, some of the problems of the theatrical version have been addressed. The shipwreck is just as rushed in this cut as in the theatrical version, but the pacing problems in the astonishingly spectacular siege finale are much improved by the addition of a fairly minimal amount of footage. It no longer seems quite so hurried and there's more of a sense of the human cost after the battle at the Christopher Gate that was lacking in the shorter version by the simple expedient of including characters we briefly get to know among the dead. There IS one massive miscalculation after the siege where a redundant swordfight has been added: not only is it completely ineffective, dwarfed by the sheer scale and weight of what has come before, but it's also unnecessary, winding up a plot point no-one cares about any more and simply underlining the events of the previous scene.<br /><br />It also now comes with added Bill Paterson, which is rarely a bad thing, especially since his brief scene as a compassionate Bishop establishes the incompatibility of fanatical adherence to religious law with the actions of a loving savior that is one of the film's major themes. Although most of the Christian clerics here are transparent hypocrites, they are also counterbalanced by David Thewlis' Knight Hospitaler just as the `good' Muslims are counterbalanced by fanatics as both Saladin and Baldwin have to walk a tightrope with their own people to prevent war.<br /><br />Thanks to a strong script this is easily Scott's best film since Blade Runner. Unlike Gladiator it doesn't feel like it was written on the hoof, and he has enough confidence in the material not to overdo the stylisticsat the expense of the storytelling: here the visuals serve the picture, which isn't always the case in his past work. Even John Mathieson, probably the worst cinematographer to ever win an Oscar, finally delivers the goods. CGI is used sparingly and very effectively when it is (none of the poor FX problems that plagued parts of Gladiator here, thankfully). Instead, much of the spectacle is shot for real - not only is it usually cheaper, but it's certainly a lot more impressive to look at.<br /><br />The transfer quality is not as good as on the theatrical version, but it's more than acceptable. The extra features on the 4-disc set are impressive (or what I've seen of them), including a deeply depressed screenwriter mulling over its US failure. Of the additional deleted scenes included as extras, there's nothing that needed to go back into the picture: most are ideas that didn't really work while a couple are just plain silly. The DVD also includes an interesting collection of trailers and TV spots that try to sell it as everything from The Passion of the Christ II in an outrageous piece of false advertising involving adding a \\"Don't worry, God is with me\\" line of dialog not in the film (particularly ironic considering its Humanist viewpoint and the crisis of faith of its hero), a family movie, an epic adventure, a country and western rock video and a kick-a** heavy metal teen bloodbath: anything to avoid mentioning Muslims or, God forbid, history. Can't think why this didn't take off at the US box-office... Blu-ray buyers get the short end of the stick, though - just a trailer with no other extras carried over.<br /><br />THE TWO-DISC THEATRICAL CUT<br /><br />Kingdom of Heaven turns out to be Ridley Scott's best film since Blade Runner, largely because for once his visuals are matched with a pretty good script that doesn't feel like an afterthought. While most critics, aware of the longer director's cut on the horizon, found it rushed, I had no such problem: true,the film has the quickest shipwreck in screen history and the love story quickly disappears (a shame, because Eva Green gives the film a lightness it otherwise lacks), but for the most part it's journey is well told. Nor is it overly politically correct - the Muslims might be more honorable than some of the Crusaders, but that doesn't make them any less ruthless. Its biggest structural problem is the siege finale, which for all the impressive visuals pales besides Orlando's last couple of efforts at the battlements, The Two Towers and Troy, and unfortunately feels rushed and underpowered and ultimately overstylized. We're never in the thick of it, either emotionally or visually.<br /><br />For a film about religious and moral ideals, it's a curiously untriumphant epic dealing with the failure of reason and compromise. Even it's hero's attempts to live a decent life becomes a part of that failure: when offered the chance to save the city from war and get the girl, his knightly code will not allow him, condemning the people of Jerusalem to war. That, and the fact that it's a film about a loser may well be part of the reason for the film's failure to find an audience in America, but it's also one of the things that makes it so interesting. Even though it's full of historical errors, it does encompass the ebb and flow of a state of mind in a point in history surprisingly well.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom is far from disastrous even if he's not quite good enough. He does the grim and serious stuff well, but he doesn't offer much else: there's no light or shade to the performance, just a conscientiousness that isn't exactly wrong for the character but still leaves you hoping for something more as the third act comes along. If he's not exactly two-dimensional, he does at least manage one-and-a-half more dimensions than Clive Owen did in King Arthur and never embarrasses himself as much as Colin Farrell did in parts of Alexander. The supporting cast are mostly on good form, although Edward Norton seems to be doing Anthony Zerbe's leper turn from Papillon as the dying king.<br /><br />The film was shot largely with real extras for all but the largest crowd scenes, which plays real dividends here. Aside from giving you a sense of a world outside the main characters, it also highlights one of the real limitations of CGi extras: their failure to interact with the elements. It doesn't feel like a computer game but a conflict involving real people, which helps ground the story and give it a sense of weight. John Mathieson's photography is infinitely superior to his overpraised work on Gladiator even though he does overdo the dreariness of Europe.<br /><br />Harry Gregson-Williams' score is competent, but it's telling that much of the film needed to be scored with several cues from Graeme Revell's Crow, Marco Beltrani's Blade and, most effectively in the \\"Rise a knight\\" sequence, Jerry Goldsmith's Valhalla prayer from The 13th Warrior - so don't be surprised if you find yourself suddenly wanting to see one of them straight afterwards!<br /><br />Extras on the two-disc version are plentiful and mostly different from those on the four disc director's cut.
B000001F9E|5.0|When you look at the Jailbreak album you might think Thin Lizzy is about 'The Boys are Back in Town' because DJ's play the music they're most comfortable with. Not so.<br /><br />The group was fairly prodigous. Vagabonds. Chinatown. Black Rose. And many others defined this great Irish group, a precursor to U2 and (mind the step, please) right in step with the great rock groups of their time. I can't say that Phil Lynott was Ireland's answer to Bruce Springsteen yet there is a lot of similarity between the message of freedom and hope along with the pulsating beat of great rock 'n roll undimminished by countries or class lines.<br /><br />DJ's play the music they believe the fans are used to. Not a low blow but the last of the DJ's that pushed the envelope to INTRODUCE fans to OTHER music that musicians and lyricists wrote is Allison Steele 'The Night Bird' on WNEW in New York in the early '70's and Scott Muni on AM New York. So 'Jailbreak' and 'The Boys . . .' are good pieces of music but try 'Warrior,' 'Emerald'and 'The Cowboy  Song' from this album. 5 stars. Excellent music. Larry Scantlebury
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This album is not metalcore and it isn't intended to be.  So all of you who are going to bad mouth it, go ahead. <br /> <br />If you know what to listen for, you'd know that this is it. <br /> <br />
1591391105|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and though I am not \\"in transition\\" right now, I found Watkins' suggestions very helpful. He gives interesting illuminations to transitions and the many pitfalls a newcomer may encounter and avoid, if aware. Watkins also provides useful matrices and checklists that allow the reader to visualize situations and needs. This should be mandatory reading for anyone in business.
B000063147|5.0|This album is the heaviest of their three and evidently, the most screaming.  Focused mainly on heavy metal and punk themes, it lacks guitar solos and is strong on the heavy/grungy riffs.  Thankfully, the bass is audible, unlike most bands of today, where the bassist is just an image.   <br /> <br />Vocals aren't so strong but good overall, especially in \\"Warmness.\\"  But that's not the core of the sound in this album so it really doesn't matter. <br /> <br />If you like hardcore, metalcore, or metal, this album shouldn't be too far from your interests. <br /> <br />\\"Turn the Other Way\\" is the song to listen to.
B00005AQE8|5.0|The Best double CD there is smooth beats and stuff u can sit back and smoke and drink to no filler songs jus good cd.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|There are people who complain that this isn't death metal (black metal, kids) but it's not supposed to be.  That shouldn't even be mentioned, being black metal doesn't make you better.  And there are those who say that the drummer sucks and can't play 1400 beats per minute, and their knowledge of music and maturity really shows through.  I'm sure that The Reverand (the drummer in A7X) can hit around 1400 bpm , but the point is that you can't sustain that kind of beat for a whole minute in the first place and it effectively kills the point of the double pedal right there.  It's not how fast you pedal, it's what you're pedaling.  End of story. <br /> <br />Back to my review.  This album has the screaming that metalcore fans love (and it's different) and has the vocals that put other metal/core bands to shame.  I'd like to see one of them try to sing as well as Matt.   <br /> <br />The guitars are actually audible as two separate guitars, one playing lead and the other rhythm, something that's hard to find in most metal bands (ESPECIALLY black metal).  Usually you get this mashed two-guitars-playing-same-notes thing.  Not in this one.   <br /> <br />Each song is very different and has its own unique qualities, take \\"Clairvoyant Disease\\" with its constant wails and the two part, \\"I Won't See You Tonight\\" with its epic and resonant sounds to its chaotic and low growls. <br /> <br />You kids listen to your \\"cool\\" black metal (which I listen to by the way).  The rest of us will enjoy Avenged Sevenfold's unique music experience.
B0006399FS|5.0|PERIOD. this is one of the greatest albums ever. I watched MTV one day where I saw the video of Vertigo which is arguably the greatest hard rock song ever recorded and the video to that legendary song is probebly the greatest video ever made. First of all, why there are so many negative reviews for this masterpiece? IF you dont like this album, OK dont LISTEN to it! it's simple as that. U2 are the greatest band ever, F*** everyone else.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|The \\"Quiet\\" Beatle breaks his silence in this magnificent DVD.  There are NO complaints here, especially with the deluxe edition of the Concert For Bangladesh.  Picture and sound quality are both excellent, considering the 34 years that have past since the concert took place.  Head and shoulders above everything else is the stellar performance turned in by George Harrison.  Never wanting the spotlight when he was a member of The Beatles, Harrison takes center stage as he leads a cast of gold-star musicians (some legendary) in a first of its kind ALL-Star benefit concert.  The Concert For Bangladesh is the granddaddy of all the benefit concerts that have come after it.  If you don't own any concert DVDs and are looking to purchase one, this is it.  It's a piece of history that's been preserved in all of its glory on DVD.  Although George passed away in 2001, his legacy as a great musician and humanitarian is very much alive.  The Concert For Bangladesh DVD: A+
B00000JMP9|5.0|There is one reason why I have to rate 5 stars - the Peter Dvorsky as Werther. In my opinion he was the best Werther ever. Werther is a role of great passion and so Peter is. He is glorious voice of great power, in spite of he nothing lost of his emotianl feelings, wonderful colours and exactly phrasing. Absolutely inimitable is his wonderful shining color of his voice, which makes him perfect. Every time I watch this video I am amazed of him. Every time I hear him I feel physicaly need of standing ovations..  <br />I think the main hero of the opera Werther is the character of Werther. Therefore I don't understand why on the title of DVD is noted only Brigite Fasbaender (even though she is also very good). It's a pity that Peter Dvorsky is not well known wolrldwide. In the past he made a wonderful creations of Rodolfo, Nemorino, Faust (in which I consider him one of the best ever as well) , but nobody knows him. <br />I still have this recording on VHS , but now I am going to buy the DVD.
0618526412|5.0|Never has a portrait of a simple tragedy been painted so poignantly as in Carson McCullers' novel \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\\", the story of a small Southern town, and more specifically, a few select people in the town, and their interaction with a gentle deaf mute named John Singer. The characters confide their hearts and feelings into Mr. Singer, who they have no way of communicating with, and treat him as the closest and most dear of friends without ever knowing a thing about him outside of a few words he scribbles on pieces of paper from time to time. McCullers' writing is masterful and eloquent, providing an insight into not only the Southern culture of her time, but the nature of the human heart itself.
0192802631|5.0|Not always the most popular of Austen novels but definitely reflective of her older amd more mature style. It is interesting as this is the first time that the Napoleonic Wars are actively referred to, and yet the only novel she completed in peace time.  <br /> <br />Written at the end of the Napoleonic Wars it is about Anne, daughter of a somewhat snobbish small country gentleman whose idea of himself is far exceeded by his actual worth. She has been persuaded to refuse the only offer for her hand in marriage to a low ranked officer. Now years later through a bad coincidence he has returned to the neighbourhood. He has done well in the wars and is now highly ranked and wealthy from his prize money. <br /> <br />Anne must contend with her own feelings even as she sees him happy with the daughters of her neighbour - perhaps ready to chose one of them as his wife. <br /> <br />This is very much the conflict of class over substance, of appearance over reality and of the ability to trust one's self over the persuasions of others around. <br /> <br />Letters play an enormously important part in Austen's novels, and the use of a letter in this book is wildly romantic and almost dangerous in the context of the situation.  <br /> <br />I love this novel, it involves an older, more mature heroine, and one who really deserves to be loved. It has much gentler sequences in it than say the rambunciousness of Pride and Prejudice.  <br /> <br />I may be biased about Austen, but I believe they make some of the best reading about - funny, wildly romantic and deeply satisfying to read.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I love this movie because it's so simple but so moving. I really feel for the characters and Paul Mercurio is soooo amazing! Seeing him dancing with Tara Morice could make any girl weak in the knees! The other great thing about the movie is that it's so artsy, you really have to stick with it the first time you watch it and not think \\"this is stupid\\" and quit, because behind the slapstick and make-up and glitter is a humanity and humor that is worth watching over and over again. Besides the movie just has those magic moments, like when Fran and Scott are on the roof, or the last dance (Ahh! I LOVE that dance!)and so many other moments. I say everyone, but especially dancers and the romantic at heart should watch this, everyone in my family loves it, including my Dad!
B00005JNY4|2.0|What if John Stockwell director of 'Blue Crush' makes a tresure hunting film starring Paul Walker and Jessica Alba?  And what if that's based on the script by Matt Johnson, who once gave us terrible bike action 'Torque'?   <br /> <br />The answer is 'Into the Blue.'  I am more than ready to enjoy silly stories, but this is too silly for me.  Four young Americans come upon a sunken airplane in the Bahamas, which carries lots of packages containing white powder.  And these characters are treasure hunting diver Jared (Paul Walker), his beautiful love Sam (Jessica Alba), his philandering friend Bryce (Scott Caan), and Bryce's newly-met girlfriend Amanda (Ashley Scott). <br /> <br />So far it's OK.  It's a light-hearted version of 'A Simple Plan,' but here's another story.  It is about a legend of a pirate ship that went down many years ago, and they might have hit the place where it has been sleeping deep in the ocean.  Now Jared needs more money.  So what he should do?  Sell the illegal cargo?  Or follow the wiser advice of Sam? <br /> <br />I am still ready to believe this contrived situations, and that is fine with me as long as the following actions are good.  But how could they be thrilling or exciting when these characters always (yes, always) take a wrong decision, willingly get into trouble one after another when the right answer is right before them?  They always do what they shouldn't do; they say wrong things to the wrong people, and do wrong things to the wrong people, to perpetrate another mistake.   <br /> <br />In others words, we see the dangers of diving, guns, car chase (yes, there is one!), and sharks (it's open water, remember?), none of them really makes us care the characters, some of whom are so irritating.  Even the the sharks fail to convince us, because when the film needs actions, only the more dangerous kinds appear conveniently.   <br /> <br />The underwater photography of 'Into the Blue' is certainly beautiful like first-rate documentary programs about the nature, and young bodies of Paul Walker and Jessica Alba are attractive enough to make us forget they are not acting at all (should they?), the film needs something better than that, especially in the last half, in which every cliche of B thriller is unashamedly used, including the cardboard characters of Tyson Beckford, James Frain and Josh Brolin.

B000AP2ZLC|5.0|I am an extremely happy death head these days.  Suffocation reformed last year, Nile's new one kills, Behemoth is steadily getting better and better, Hate Eternal's new album is a hell of alot better than I expected and now we have the new Cryptopsy with the return of Lord Worm.  Well being a huge fan of Lord Worm's work on None so Vile I was extactic to hear he was coming back and let me say that his hiatus from death metal has definately taken it's toll on his vocals.  Don't get me wrong he is not horrid by all means, I think he really performs well on this album, however it is a very different Lord Worm.  More high pitch screams and mid range growls take center stage here and really do compliment the music well, I guess I just had some idea of what to expect in my mind and was somewhat disappointed when I heard the final product.  After a few listens that goes away!  The music on this one is absolutely fantastic as with any other Cryptopsy CD, crisp guitar playing, Eric is one hell of a bass player and Flo...  Man I must admit at first I was thrown off by the production but how can you dislike the production of any album that pushes the most impressive musician to the forefront?  The drums on this one are thunderous, even the strongest stereo equipment will shudder, and Flo destroys his kit on this one as usual.  There is one part in particular where the music comes to a halt and Flo goes off with quick double bass kicks then systematically slows them down to a crawl with such precision it made my jaw drop.  He proves every time out why he is considered one of if not the best drummer in metal today.  Overall this is as strong an album as Cryptopsy has ever released, I can't say I like it better than NSV or Whisper Supremacy but I can say that it blows And Then You'll Beg out of the water.  2005 has been a great year for metal, death metal in particular and Once Was Not is definately the best death metal album to be released this year.
B0000AI45P|5.0|I bought this album back in 1977 when it first came out. I was 13 at the time, and it took me a while to really get it. There was a lot of great music around then, and other records probably held sway on my record player. But it grew on me, and as musical fads came and went over the next decade or so, this was one album that always got some play. When I finally bought a CD player, 1990 I guess, this was one of the first CDs I bought (the record was pretty worn by then). And a couple of years ago I bought the remastered version.  <br />So I payed three times for this album. And does it bother me? Not at all. Because this music is so extraordinary, so far from common, I would buy it a thousand times. People mention grey little bands like The Strokes et al., and I just don't see it. Nothing compares to this truly dazzling collection. It doesn't sound like any other record I have ever heard. Even Television's other albums, which have their moments, don't compare to this. <br />Two guitars, yet not a cliched blues lick in sight. There is such intensity in every note. It burns with a cold and dazzling fury. Hysteria and precision. <br />The text in the latest version raises some interesting questions. How would it have sounded had they recorded it at Rudy van Gelder's place, where so many legendary jazz sides were cut? It's hard to imagine it being any better. Maybe it would have sounded a little more organic. But that's not necessarily a good thing, because, as someone says in the liner notes, \\"this is not earth music.\\" This is interstellar stuff. Brilliant.

B00000I2PG|5.0|\\"We spend a lot of time writing and crafting the songs-they must be danceable, memorable, intelligent, functional, passionate. These things shouldn't be excluded from pop music-they should be exploited and exaggerated.\\" <br /> <br />ABC's debut album, coming out in 1982 amongst a flurry of Post-Disco/Brit New Wave acts, linked ABC with bands like  Spandau Ballet, Human League, Culture Club, Kajagoogoo, Gary Numan, Scritti Politti and Howard Jones.  Certainly many of those bands shared a love of classic Motown, but ABC was never part of any scene, and considered themselves outsiders.  From the first \\"The Lexicon of Love\\" was something else entirely and seemed to cut through the airwaves like a knife once the first piano chords and wailing saxophone of \\"The Look of Love\\" gave way to the funky syncopated baseline and lead singer Martin Fry's choir-boy inflected voice declaring dramatically: <br /> <br />\\"When your world is full of strange arrangements <br />And gravity won't pull you through <br />You know you're missing out on something <br />Well that something depends on you....\\" <br /> <br />The song instantly propelled them to fame in the US and Europe, but unlike many of their contemporaries, ABC had a fully realized album to back up their single.  Over twenty years later, \\"The Lexicon of Love\\" is increasingly mentioned in the list of recording studio masterworks, largely due to the skill, audacity and precociousness of studio engineer wonderboy Trevor Horn, who cut his teeth with the Buggles, and had embraced the DIY - Keyboard/Synth/Pop esthetic and with this recording, declared himself heir apparent the minute it was released and people realized just how damn good a bunch of machines in service of some well crafted pop songs could sound.   <br /> <br />I don't think it's hyperbole whatsoever to say that this album was a dividing point and paradigm shift in the history of modern recorded music.  It subsequently inspired what is now a long line of producer/engineers as artists, and can be traced directly to the work of Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis, and contemporary acts like NIN, Prodigy, Daft Punk, Crystal Method, and the collected works of Dr. Dre.  The samples, the lush orchestral flourishes, the Fairlight, the pulsing Base and Drum lines that still sound fresh twenty years later -- this is an album that is best described as unabashedly artificial, in service curiously to the demands of idealists who would accept nothing less than a sound that would grab your ears, and pack the dance floor of London's most fashionable night club. <br /> <br />Certainly ABC as credited, was primarily Martin Fry, who gave the band it's New Romantic front man image, Motown influences, and sex appeal (not to mention that bit of vintage 80's sexual-preference ambiguity) supported primarily through the years by guitarist Mark White.   Fry's arch english annunciation and distinctive warbling tenor voice which frequently jumps a falseto octave when the time seems right, matched perfectly his penchant for ambiguously clever rhyming wordplay.  But the ABC of \\"Lexicon of love\\" was more a collaborative studio project with contributions not only from Horn and the other 2 members of ABC, but also Anne Dudley (who would become Art of Noise with Horn) providing Orchestral flourishes on keyboards, and Tessa Web who sings choruses, and provides backing vocals on several tracks most notably \\"Poison Arrow\\" which became a major radio hit, and staple of MTV.   <br /> <br />\\"The Look of Love\\" is very much studio lightning in a bottle, and provides a high water mark of the studio art joining the list of similarly regarded albums like \\"Pet Sounds\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  What the IPod/MP3 generation will likely miss is that \\"Lexicon of Love\\" was also a carefully constructed and arranged collection of song, with instrumental diversions inserted between tracks, and songs that flow from one to another elevating the collection to something more thanthe sum of its parts.  That this was the intention and design was made quite clear in the album liner, which featured what appeared to be lyrics to a song, but were in fact, snippets of lines from each of the songs placed together to form one continuous lyric.   <br /> <br />In the short-attention-span 21st century, where software on our digital player creates a virtual radio station, few newcomers to the songs on the album will probably ever fully appreciate the way the absence or presence of a second or two of silence can help build on the theatrical design of an album like this one -- how the opening track \\"Show Me\\" flows into \\"Poison Arrow\\" for example. If you can, listen to the CD without those features on to get the full effect.  It's no surprise that in the years since the album was released, people who first experienced it on vinyl and were blown away and forever changed by what it accomplished sonically, have made sure the album appears on magazine and critics best lists, despite all the assumptions that accompanied it originally, when ABC was seen as one of many bands to be consumed and dicarded as byproducts of a short lived fad.   <br /> <br />The bands follow up, \\"Beauty Stab\\" was a major departure from this album, and perhaps an attempt to acknowledge that despite the 14 additional musicians the band required to to perform the songs of \\"Lexicon of Love\\" on their first world tour, ABC actually had aspirations to be an honest to goodness guitar/drums/bass performing unit. It would be an understatement to say that what for many other bands would have been seen as a strong collection, for ABC was a spectacular disaster. <br /> <br />Which is not to say, that it's even possible to seperate where the artistry of Fry and his bandmates, and their years of songwriting and performance, honing their material ends, and the studio wizardy and session musician contributions begin.  In other words, without the songs, and the conceptual design, studio perfection canonly get you so far.  The two halves were required for the whole.  \\"The Lexicon of Love\\" was born of collaboration and shared aspirations, and despite Fry's deliberation, long recruitment and rehearsal period, and intense focused vision, it certainly is less the product of a band, and more a carefully crafted art piece, offering a first glimpses of what the digital age had in store for us.
B000957O82|4.0|Hitch is one of these movies that goes for the heart and is quite successful for the most part except where a few scenes towards the end overrun it a bit. Not watching the Hitch trailer is a big advantage as many of the best moments are in that 30 second burst. The introduction of Kevin James as Albert marks a new comedy actor on the rise and we can be sure to see plenty more of him... in fact Will Smith might be undercutting himself (after the summer blockbuster \\"I, Robot\\") by becoming the sidekick instead of the leading man in a number of scenes, we still shouldn't be blaming his agent, as this is the kind of comedy we want. The story revolves around Hitch, a sort of matchmaking cupid professional who specializes in the build-up and execution of that `one kiss shot' because `8/10 women believe that the first kiss tells them everything they need to know'. Upper-class fashion slave acolytes and executive board members make up Hitch's main customers and so we are definitely on `Sex in the City' ground that has taken a few lessons from old movies with the same sort of theme. This `Love Doctor' comedy is easily one of the better pleasantry surprises you will see in 2005.

B000B0WO0I|3.0|These days, there just isn't all that much to rave about from acts during the 1980's that were smashes. While there there have been some welcomed comebacks like Erasure with Nightbird that dhowcased a great new audience, others have maintained their presence by just the music alone. Simply Red has been under that radar. After there last album, Home got highly recognized here in the U.S. with hits like Sunrise and You Make Me Feel Brand New scored, Mick Hucknall and company have still got a long way to go to capture a new audience. The latest thing now is actually from those old gems of the past, their old 80's gems.<br /><br />Simply Red's new record, Simplified, their first album in 2 years, is a more stripped down soulful showcase of a lot of their big tracks from their Warner Brothers status from the 80's and early 90's. The songs on here are decent and delightfully reworked for newcomers, but for die hard fans, it is just a mixed bag. The collection includes reworked versions of great songs like Holding Back The Years, the down to Earth ballad For Your Babies, Your Mirror, and the fully stripped-down version of Something Got Me Started. The album does however include some new material as well such as their latest single Perfect Love, and Sad Old Red as well. Yet, there are some other great tracks that also could've been re-recorded here on this package like If You Don't Know Me By Now, and It's Only Love as well.<br /><br />All in all, Simply Red's Simplified does fairly carry on well as a great record and a new welcomed chance for anybody who hasn't heard any of their great pop songs, but for others who just know them by now, you're just better off getting their 1996 Greatest Hits record instead.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Mastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Just a short and simple comment.<br /><br />All good films push the line and threaten us just a bit. Scarface did this in 1983 and clearly still does that today in 2005. I was only 5 years old when this movie came out, but as I grew older and saw it, I loved it. It shows you that no matter how big and ballsy you are, there's always a ceiling you'd better keep an eye out for.<br /><br />And in closing, a simple FYI:<br /><br />Scarface inspired GTA...the game is based (loosely on the premise) of the movie, not the other way around.... *insert eye roll here* ; )
0066620996|5.0|As far as the significance of the content of this book is concerned, it is for each one of us to judge; but this book is terribly persuasive because of it's richness of data driven analysis. These insights are reason enough, in my opinion, to buy this book & spend an evening with it. However, outside of content, here are many other reasons why you'd love to read it.<br /><br />Setting the context: Almost nothing is unstated in this book. If assumptions are made, they are put down in print. If conditions apply, the author mentions them. So everything follows.<br /><br />Structure: The book is well organized. The traits of \\"good to great\\" companies are presented in a logical order. There is a summary section at the end of each chapter for quickly sifting through. A lot of information is tabularized, especially comparison data. There are a good number of graphical representations too.<br /><br />Lucidity: As most books that I've taken a liking towards, the complexity of its content does not reflect on its language. It is incredibly comprehensible, irrespective of your familiarity with the corporate world.<br /><br />I urge you to buy this book & read it. It is one reason why I've chosen not to talk about the content which, I repeat, is compelling.<br /><br />And most certainly, you do not need to be a CEO or anything remotely close, to take these lessons out & look to make a difference to whatever it is that you do for a living.<br /><br />S!
B0007TKNL0|3.0|It's easy to see why this movie is mostly rated with 5 stars even though it's not that good. In fact, I almost didn't buy the movie when I heard Sarah Brightman was not the star. It seemed to me that Mr Webber should not even consider anyone else at this point in time. <br /> <br />On the Bonus Disc we are told that Sarah Brightman turned down the role. At first I thought it might be because of her age. Then I realized that she probably has enough money to buy her own country and a concert schedule that would surely kill any normal person. I was wrong on all counts - Ms Brightman is not only the most loved woman in the world, with every great quality you could ask for in a woman, she is also very, very smart. <br /> <br />I purchased this movie because of reviews about how great the sets were. Actually, the sets are the most beautiful I have ever seen in any movie. That's where it ends. <br /> <br />The story has been changed a bit but the real problem is the movie has nothing to offer. The young female lead is pleasant to look at with a good voice. I also discovered that Minnie Driver is actually a very talented actress. Other than the points I have mentioned, the movie is only average. I have played this movie on my large screen TV many times and it has put me to sleep on every attempt to view it. The last time I watched it in 15 minute sections.  <br /> <br />At no point could I find an interest in the actors, the characters, or the story, and certainly not the music. I find it hard to believe that so much beauty has gone into a movie that offers so little. However, there is a bright spot. Buy the two disc version. The Bonus disc makes the package worthwhile. There are many clips of Ms Brightman from previous performances which makes this disc is a real treasure. You can always pass the movie disc along as a gift if you don't care for it. <br /> <br />
B00007GZR5|4.0|This movie contains a profound but slightly inaccurate message about life after death and reincarnation. For example, this movie talks about everlasting hell for souls who commit suicide. But this message is inaccurate to say the least.    In \\"[[ASIN:0399142789 Conversations with God : An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 1)]]\\", God states that there is no such thing as hell. (This is a profound statement with very deep implications) However the philosophical view on reincarnation in this film is fairly accurate.    Forgetting the message in this film, this picture is one of the most sentimental movies of all time. The director's view on soul mates is very accurate and gives hope to millions of lovers everywhere. Death is simply not the end of our existence; when death arrives, we simply change form and this message is very reassuring to the millions of souls who fear death. Robin's acting is top class and I am surprised that he did not win an Oscar for this movie.     Lastly, I would also like to recommend the books \\"[[ASIN:0399153292 The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)]]\\" by Neale Donald Walsch for those who have seen this movie. God has even inspired the director to make this movie for the masses!
B000025XE5|5.0|The review title refers to what this CD consists of: This influential band's first 9 singles along with their flipsides chronologically ordered. I gave this CD five stars because even the flipsides are great (e.g., \\"I Want You\\", \\"As I Ride By\\"). Simple and raw mostly. Caveman rock (a precursor to the punk sound). Other influences? \\"Give It To Me\\" sounds like a pre-evolved Bay City Roller's \\"Saturday Night.\\" Also: a Troggs session was recorded with the band bickering in the studio (available elsewhere as the Trogg Tapes), which supposedly became the inspiration for the movie \\"Spinal Tap.\\" I mention this only because \\"Love is All Around\\" reminds me of Tap's \\"Flower People\\" and the rest of the CD sounds like 60's alternatives to \\"Big Bottom.\\" Not necessarily the music, but the mind-set is pretty much in the same place. Much more than \\"Wild Thing,\\" but more of the same, as well.
B00006399Z|4.0|The rough edges of this disc are what gives it it's lasting charm.  If it had been merely competent, professionally-executed performances of \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" and \\"40,000 Headman,\\" it would be nothing special -- just a curio for completists.<br /><br />On the contrary, though, the band sounds re-energized and turns in more rhythm-based versions of some of their classics.  Even a tad sloppy -- bear in mind we are talking about Traffic being \\"sloppy\\" -- on \\"Medicated Goo.\\"  It makes the whole atmosphere infectious, sounding like a fortuitously captured document of an exciting gig.  There are times when less-than-perfect sound quality actually adds to a listening experience.<br /><br />Dave Mason's contribution, \\"Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave\\" seems quite timely and topical these days, and this is THE definitive version of \\"Gimme Some Lovin',\\" injecting that old chestnut with more life than I thought it could contain.  Indeed, the song makes several attempts to jump out of the shuffle-jitter of its relentless guitar riff, a true reinterpretation of a song that could have merely been the cliche \\"big hit\\" encore.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin-II (1969) The definitive hard rock album by the British quartet practically defined what \\"heavy metal\\" sounded like on their sophomore effort. Jimmy Page's guitar riffage on tracks like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" are just so, well, heavy. John Paul Jones' beautiful organ solo in \\"Thank You\\" combine with Robert Plant's lyrics to create the ultimate love song. And let's not forget John Bonham's five minutes of pounding on the drums, sometimes bare-handed, on \\"Moby Dick.\\" This album grew out of their live show and is reflected in bluesy improv-sounding tracks like \\"The Lemon Song.\\" Also a great headphones album (check out the end of \\"What is and What Should Never Be\\"), this is blues-based hard rock at its best.
B00008G8M4|5.0|\\"Independence Day\\" has to be one of my favourite movies of all time. The story is about aliens invading our sordid planet but the director has a deeper meaning in store for us in this classic film. For example, when the President of the United States was giving encouragement to the people of the world, he said that he demands independence not just for America but for the whole world from the aliens. His speech of world unity in the face of catastrophic crisis is an inspiration for world peace. Moreover, the use of nuclear weapons in this film is a reminder to the viewers that weapons of mass destruction can be useful if used correctly. The film \\"[[ASIN:B0002V7OI8 Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)]]\\" also gives the audience a similar view.    Lastly, the comic element of this film brings about a sense of comedy in this 'serious' message the film is trying to convey to the viewers. Will Smith's acting is superb as usual and I would definitely recommend this film to UFO fans and fans of Will Smith. A MUST watch.

B0000931QA|5.0|Queensryche-Operation: Mindcrime (1988) Before they brought you \\"Silent Lucidity,\\" Seattle's best hard rock band churned out this amazing piece of work. Another concept album, it is a story of a drug addict named Nikki who falls in with a corrupt political leader, Dr. X. He soon falls in love with an ex-prostitute-turned nun named Mary (of course) and becomes brainwashed, murdering the lecherous priest. Mary is also murdered and Nikki is framed by Dr. X for both crimes. Fans of \\"the `ryche\\" were left wondering, \\"Who killed Mary?\\" for over a year. Singer Geoff Tate was trained as an opera singer, while the entire band are amazing musicians in their own right. There are some great left-winged political lyrics in songs like \\"Revolution Calling.\\" The operatic mini-epic, \\"Suite Sister Mary,\\" is also awe-inspiring. Queensryche have always been called the \\"thinking man's metal band.\\"
6305531412|2.0|This movie introduced and was focused on a new animated character Roger Rabbit.  However, the selling point of this movie was the inclusion of tons of characters from previously competing cartoon franchises.    The movie was much more a display of the Disney Company flexing its muscles in regards to it's business-level victory over its competition and to show its current financial dominance over the various animation companies from animation's Golden Age.    So we have Daffy Duck in piano playing competition on the same screen with Donald Duck!  What makes this extremely annoying is taking characters such as Daffy with such an established rich history of character development.   Here in Roger Rabbit, Daffy is just a \\"daffy duck\\" playing a piano.  My expectations were to see DAFFY DUCK playing a piano along with all that that implies.  WFRR's daffy duck was similar to the early black and white Daffy Duck during the Leon Schlesinger time of Looney Tunes.   I certainly enjoy the Looney Tunes of Schlesinger's era but it certainly does not represent the rich character that Daffy developed into.   And even then Daffy still had more personality then just being 'daffy' as presented here.    We also have my all-time favorite cartoon character Droopy being poorly drawn not at all faithful to Tex Avery's character just appearing for a second in a stupid cameo to give a line that was presented in a way also unfaithful to Droopy's established personality.    We have a slew of these cameos from Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Mighty Mouse, etc.  None of which showed any respect to these characters but were obviously Disney showing its financial might in having the rights to use these characters.    Not that WFRR didn't do the same with Disney characters.  Not being a big fan of Disney animation, I didn't mind as much.    I guess I can consider the possibility that WFRR did not mean to purposefully sell the borrowed characters short.  It shows a difference in the focus of the different cartoon franchises.  Disney animation focuses much more on story and technical artistry of the features.      In contrast to Disney was Warner Brothers and MGM.  While the artistry was superior to Disney it was in a less intricate and focused on style instead of technically grand design of Disney.  However, the most dividing difference in Disney and WB/MGM animation was Disney showed little interest in establishing characters.  WB/MGM were almost entirely focused on making characters.    In other words, Disney character's personalities were designed to serve the story.  WB/MGM's stories were designed to serve the characters.    That is where WFRR offends, we have all these great characters just appearing randomly at best but usually contrary to character.    This movie really should have had only the Roger Rabbit story in it.  It really wasn't that bad.  In fact, it was good. The animation was fine.  The story was funny and enhanced by the gags (only the ones by WFRR original characters).    As for Roger Rabbit himself, he's made for this movie which is fine.  But he's not a character that is interesting in himself outside of his place in this movie.  Nothing wrong with that.  It would have been an enjoyable movie if left at that.    The poor treatment of classic characters really caused me to dislike this film.
B00005JO1G|2.0|\\"Welcome to the suck.\\" <br /> <br />You know, I was never sure what that meant. Well, I was never sure about a lot of things while watching \\"Jarhead.\\" I wasn't sure about who the main character, Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), truly was as a person in terms of his past and present. I wasn't sure why the bond between Swofford and Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) was so strong. I wasn't sure why Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx) loved his job so much that he sacrificed a life at home with family and children (as he mentions in a rather empty speech toward the end that's intended to be hard-hitting and profound). There is far too much ambiguity for this film to be coherent. If intentional, the vague distance isn't as effective as in films like \\"Code 46\\" where it provides for tonal excellence. In \\"Jarhead\\" it simply leaves you cold.  <br /> <br />Sam Mendes is obviously talented with aesthetics and presentation. Honestly, much of the camera work is mesmerizing despite it obviously being some of Roger Deakins' least inspired work: raining oil, \\"bleeding earth,\\" camels and natives in the distance, blurred shots of men in gas masks playing foot ball, etc. The image of a horse galloping up to Swofford covered in oil against a background of fire and dark sky seemed to be straight from \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" Still, it doesn't add much. Honestly, how much does the actual package matter when what's inside is plain and emotionally uninvolving. Mendes' \\"Road to Perdition\\" had the same problem. It looked like an Oscar winner but felt like an entirely minor and forgettable entry into the Mafia genre. This time around, however, I doubt \\"Jarhead\\" will receive a single nod from the Academy. It's paper thin, even more so than \\"Perdition.\\"

B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses-Appetite for Destruction (1987) Critics have said that the debut GN'R album sounded like Hollywood, and they were right. The band grew out of the \\"big hair\\" glam metal scene on Sunset Blvd., but you could never tell by the sound of this album. Loud, raw, blues-influenced, and angry, this album did for hard rock what Nirvana did for \\"alternative\\" four years later. It exposed bands like Poison and Enuff Z Nuff for what they really were, a bunch of lipstick-wearing poseurs. \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\" reintroduced the power ballad to a generation and went to ..1 in the summer of '88. Axl Rose's lyrics spoke of sex and drugs and wreaked of misogyny, yet I knew every word. Slash poured pure emotion into his guitar, and the underestimated Izzy laid down excellent rhythms. This album reminds me of junior high school, before we all had to be responsible and p.c. (politically correct).

You wont even stand up for me right here in America,  for my rights and my religious beliefs.  You wont even stand up for me right here at home\\"          Muhammad Ali (Will Smith) 'ALI'                   'ALI',Micheal Mann's biography on the ledgendary Muhammad Ali, is both a success and a failure,it just depends on what you look for in it.Those wanting to know more about the boxing icon (usually the very reason we devote our time to biopic films),will be left sorely dissapointed.However,this film should not be approached as an examination of the man behind the great image(Will Smith's mesmerising performance is more impersonation than character study)or even as an old fashioned sports movie.  Instead Mann concentrates more on how one man and his achievments,his charisma,beliefs and ultimatly,his flaws,can uplift and give hope to his generation.  Mann has settled to recreate the turbulent times as a backdrop for Ali's accomplishments  and does so admiringly well.  Featuring classy performances from Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight,and other great cast choices that recreate fittingly the people associated with Classius Clay and his world.  This is a Mann movie from the very start,combining beautiful and controlled cinematography with a truly special soundtrack to make for some wonderfully effective moments,both in and out of the ring.
B000002N2P|4.0|After the commercial and critical success of their multiplatinum, breakout smash Dookie, Green Day found themselves being cast out by their punk peers.  The clubs they called home would no longer take them in (and due to Green Day's popularity, couldn't even if they had wanted to).  Green Day's response to their rejection was Insomniac: a snottier, angrier and wearier album than its predecessor.  Sometimes brilliant, sometimes boring, but always stuffed full of the same angst and paranoia as before, Billie Joe uses the same formula but works with some darker overtones this time around.  \\"Brat\\" shows him waiting for his parents to keel over to get inheritance, \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" is a nightmarish tale of amphetamine use, \\"Jaded\\" is a dizzying attack of punk muscle, and \\"Walking Contradiction\\" is a classic example of Billie Joe's cynicism.  While these songs are particularly strong and give us an inkling of just what Billie Joe's capable of creating, it's on the songs that aren't particularly about anything at all where the album starts to lose its edge.  The weaker songs impact it just enough to make Insomniac the lesser of Green Day's previous works but with five stellar singles, including the technically stunning \\"Stuck With Me\\" and the dreary hit \\"Brain Stew,\\" this is an album that Green Day fans can't pass by.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is sure to please those looking for an entertaining, fresh, hilarious, and truthful romantic comedy.<br /><br />It starts out with Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), who meets a girl on a train named Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they soon begin to spend time with eachother.  It then cuts to the opening credits, where Joel tries to give her a necklace he bought her, but she does not seem to know who he is, and is visited by her boyfriend. Confused, Joel goes to his friends for help. He discovers a note that he wasn't supposed to have seen: it turns out that she was not happy with the relationship, and had him erased from her memory.  He goes to the place where this procedure is performed, and has it done to him.<br /><br />The whole cast turns out spectacular performences, especially the two leads, especially Carrey and Winslet.  The morph into their roles, and by the end of the movie, they are people who the audience has grown to love and root for.  Also, the team of memory-erasers, played by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson, do great jobs in their supporting roles.<br /><br />If you know anything about Charlie Kaufman, you know that his films are pretty bizarre, so it takes a special kind of director to work with his material.  But Michel Gondry is perfect for the job, balancing it being strange enough to be considered original, but not to the point where it looses the audience.<br /><br />Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best romantic comedies because of its wit, insight, humor, and honesty.
B000000WF0|5.0|The Verve-Urban Hymns (1997) Yet another band from Britain, this is the album that almost never was. The group disbanded for over a year before recording this masterpiece. Singer/lyricist Richard Ashcroft is as brilliant at songwriter as he is a singer. In \\"The Drugs Don't Work,\\" just the sound of his voice moves me. Then add to it the lyrics: \\"All this talk of getting old/it's getting me down my love.../You leave my life, I'm better off dead.\\" Chris McCabe's psychedelic guitars make the songs come alive, laying down `70's-style grooves in \\"The Rolling People.\\" Melancholy lyrics are mixed with songs of hope; shattered dreams gave way to new ones. Lyrics like, \\"Love seems to stick in the things you know.../Eyes open wide/Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye,\\" are pure poetry. Other great lines: \\"We have existence and it's all we share.../We feel numb' cause we don't see/that if we really card/and we really loved/Think of all the joy we'd feel,\\" from \\"Space and Time.\\" \\"I'm stood here naked/Smiling, I feel no disgrace/with who I am,\\" from \\"Lucky Man\\" shine with being comfortable with oneself. And my personal favorite, the opening lines from \\"Weeping Willow\\": \\"When morning breaks/we hide our eyes and our lungs' aching/nothing's strange/It was in our hands from six to ten/It slipped right out again.\\" People are just beginning to discover the greatness of this album.

B000089HCR|4.0|WASP's debut album is my personal favorite, that may be because I'm not that big of a fan.  The songs have a great Motley Crue or Kiss feel to them, two bands that I love.  If you like either of those bands, you will probably like this album. <br /> <br />1. Animal (F*** Like A Beast)-5/5.  This is my favorite WASP song.  The lyrics aren't as vulgar as you would think, with the F-bomb only being dropped twice.  The music and chorus are very catchy.  The vocals are great. <br />2. I Wanna Be Somebody-5/5.  The original lead off track from the album.  Another very catchy song, particularly the chorus, with a very anthemic feel to it.  Great music and vocals. <br />3.  Love Machine-5/5.  As cheesy as the title may sound today, this is a great song with excellent vocals and lyrics.  One of their best songs ever. <br />4. The Flame-5/5.  Another superb song.  Chorus is very catchy and the music and lyrics are excellent.  A great head-bobbing rocker. <br />5. B.A.D.-4/5.  This song is a bit of a step down.  Not quite as catchy and sounds too much like Motley Crue filler material.  Not bad, just not great. <br />6. School Daze-4/5.  Also a bit cheesy.  The music is cool, but the lyrics are kind of Who-ish about how dull school is.  That topic kinda went out a long time ago. <br />7. Hellion-4/5.  Fast paced and aggressive, this one is better than the two that proceed it.  Great vocals, with Judas Priest type lyrics. <br />8. Sleeping (In the Fire)-5/5.  A very cool slower song, but not really a ballad.  The Lyrics are really good and the vocals are excellent.  <br />9. On Your Knees-4/5.  Another filler song.  Fast paced like Hellion, but not quite as good.  Lyrics aren't up to par, but the vocals are good. <br />10. Tormentor-4/5.  Very catchy riff with good lyrics and good vocals.  A very good track. <br />11. The Torture Never Stops-4/5.  Great riff, with a catchy chorus.  Excellent vocals, cool lyrics.   <br />12. Show No Mercy-4/5.  Although this was originally a b-side, it's an excellent track.  Fast paced and musically catchy, with great vocals. <br />13. Paint It Black-2/5.  Another b-side.  I don't really like the Rolling Stones version of this song, so I don't really care for anyone else's either.  For some reason this happens to be a favorite among metalheads, but I don't like it.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is great 80's metal without all of the glam and hair or an alternative to thrash metal that was starting to take hold in the rock world.  If you like it heavy, but not too heavy, this is a great record.
B00097DXZS|3.0|In 1999 Santana made a stunning comeback with the duets album \\"Supernatural,\\" which spawned the classic summer jam \\"Smooth\\" and won 9 Grammy awards. The album came out during the height of what was being called the \\"Latin boom\\" in musical tastes which helped launch in the U.S. the careers of names like Enrique Iglesias, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. In 2002 Santana released \\"Shaman,\\" which recycled the same formula and still managed to deliver one or two memorable cuts. Now the heat of the moment has passed but not the gimmick, \\"All That I Am\\" is Santana once again packing the album with tracks featuring some popular names and slick production. The saving grace of the \\"All That I Am\\" is that it is a Santana album and so the songs aren't total crap, even the weak tunes sound better than anything recorded by Hilary Duff. Among the guests are Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Los Lonely Boys and even Sean Paul, at one point you wonder why Ashlee Simpson and Daddy Yankee are missing. The two opening tracks, \\"Hermes\\" and \\"El Fuego\\" are pure classic Santana with intricate Latin grooves, driving percussion and burning guitar licks. Then the parade begins, \\"I'm Feeling You\\" pairs Santana once again with Michelle Branch who's previous effort with the band, \\"The Game Of Love\\" in 2002's \\"Shaman\\" won a Grammy. In fact, this new song is pretty much the previous one re-worked with different words. The voice behind \\"Smooth,\\" Rob Thomas, contributes the tune \\"My Man\\" performed by Mary J. Blige and Big Boi which can only be called a Santana track because the guy's guitar can be heard underneath all the R&B beats. \\"Just Feel Better\\" features Steven Tyler, it's a nice song but you would expect burning hard rock blues with the singer from Aerosmith, not something that sounds borrowed from the Seal catalogue. \\"Trinity\\" is an instrumental featuring steel guitar genius Robert Randolph and Metallica axman Kirk Hammett. Well, it sucks. The song never goes behind simple riffing that revolves around the same melody and it only lasts 3 minutes. Anthony Hamilton on \\"Twisted\\" actually sounds like classic Santana, a cross between \\"Evil Ways\\" and \\"She's Not There.\\" \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" with Sean Paul and Joss Stone has flavor and energy, a cool break-up tune with a dramatic edge, probably the only noteworthy thing Paul's ever done. Los Lonely Boys are THE band that shows the influence of Santana on modern bands and they fit perfectly with \\"I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love\\" which is a trip back to the 70's. \\"All That I Am\\" is good music, period. It doesn't elevate Santana to a higher stature and doesn't exactly bring the band down either. The production as always is excellent and all the songs are expertly crafted, but we expect something more spontaneous from the world's most famous guitar master. We can only hope the next duets record features Sting or Bono. If anything this is good music to play at parties or get togethers, but the value of Carlos Santana will be defined by his early albums and \\"Supernatural.\\"
B000026OHN|4.0|I have heard most of the works by over 105 composers and for me Bach is the God of all composers; there is no one better than him. WTC is one of his piano masterpieces. So first, before getting carried away with the performer, we must make sure that ALL the credit goes to composer for putting together such a scintillating work of art. Now about the performer: Richter is certainly one of the finest pianists of this century. I love the way he performs Beethoven, Mozart, Liszt, Ravel, and many other composers. He was also very well known in Russia and Europe for his performances of Bach. Nevertheless, no matter how much I love his flawless technique and Germanic metronome-style precision, I still have to admit that his Bach performances are romantic. This is not a bad thing because Richter seems to know how to woo the listener no matter how he plays a piece. Even Glenn Gould, who could only accept staccato style performances and hated the slow piano music of Schubert, said that he was hypnotized when he heard Richter's Schubert, even though Richter performed the piece extra slow, as if the piece by itself was not slow enough! This is the epitome of Richter's work. Nevertheless, I must say that when it comes to Bach, there is absolutely no one that can even come close to Glenn Gould. Yes, Richter's performance is lovely, but it still smears out all the notes together, like any good romantic performance would do. Remember, by 1950s Bach's piano pieces were extinct and it was taboo to perform them for the audience since they were outdated. This was so DESPITE Richter's and others' Bach performances. It took Gould to come along and stun the audiences with the beauty of Bach's Goldberg Variations. It inspired a new generation of not only Bach lovers, but also great performers like Yo-Yo Ma. Gould did for Bach the same as Mendelssohn did almost 200 years ago when he was the first person to ever perform one of Bach's choral works after the Kapellmeister's death. <br /> <br />Bach is hailed not only as a great composer, but also as a mathematically-musical genius. His fugues contain so many interwoven themes that Richter's performance can't allow you to listen to all of them simultaneously. In contrast, Gould's crystal clear, note-perfect performance is ideal for hearing Bach in its entire glory. While I can bring numerous examples, I'll advise you to compare Gould vs. Richter on Prelude No.20, Book 1. In Richter's performance you can barely hear the left hand melody, while Gould makes you hear both voices - as if the left hand melody is trying to fight the right one, perhaps some sort of spiritual struggle within Bach when he composed the piece. So, do you think that it is correct to miss details like this? I don't know about you, but when I listen to a piece by Bach, I want to make sure that I can hear everything that this genius encoded in his music. Just imagine Brandenburg Concertos being performed with all the emphasis on just one or two of the instruments, a concerto style. That would be a poor performance. <br />For those of you who think that Glenn plays too fast, just compare Prelude No.22, Book 1. Richter's performance is great, but when you hear Gould's slower performance, you can feel all the minutiae of the drama: as if the composer is barely breathing, stopping at times, and then lashing with ever more powerful force. I had goosebumps when I heard this piece by Gould - so moving, so dramatic. Richter, on the other hand, misses the details. <br /> <br />In conclusion, despite the lacks in this recording, including the imperfect sound quality, I would still recommend it as the best old-style performance. But anyone who loves Bach, absolutely must have Gould's performance of all the piano pieces. Gould was a Bach specialist - that is all he pretty much played. He spent many hours editing all the tapes trying to make everything perfect. He would make dozens of takes of the same segment until it was perfect. Gould also made sure that besides having perfect, separate 48 preludes and fugues, everything fits together as a monolithically magnificent structure. Richter is the wonderful general surgeon who can play everything with grace and amazing technique; Gould is the ultra-specialized brain surgeon that doesn't want to know anything but neurons. He is the ultimate Bach interpreter.
B0007M22TI|5.0|The beauty of this music and the angelic voices never fail to bring a surge of emotion that wells up inside of me, almost to the point of tears.

B000BBOUU4|5.0|This two-disc edition promises to be even more fun than the single disc DVD.  The added features here shouldn't be missed! <br /> <br />There is no doubt that Tim Burton has a penchant for things that are eccentric and sometimes plain creepy. This isn't a bad thing, however -- as he demonstrates in CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, being different can be fun and quite exciting.  <br /> <br />For starters, the film has special effects and visuals that anyone would marvel at. From the opening sequence onward, the viewer is awestruck at the Factory itself, the town below, and the sharp distinction made between these places and Charlie's little house. The lighting is superb and the music is magnificent, making for a delectable opening sequence. Grandpa Joe's storytelling then ensues with rich, vibrant colors and amazing scenery.  <br /> <br />As the action continues and kids begin finding Wonka's Golden Tickets, we are introduced in turn to the winners (plus parents) and each of their peculiar quirks. By the time the children end up in the Factory, we are formally introduced to Wonka himself -- a wonderfully odd, zany, and weird character in his own right (played beautifully by Depp).  <br /> <br />The Factory tour consumes much of the rest of the film and accounts for a considerable amount of wackiness. The verdant Candy Meadow, the River of Chocolate (plus the Waterfall!), and many other gorgeous locales await the viewer. Each has its own peculiarities, but the adventure never stops as the group treks through the Factory, finding excitement and humor around every corner.  <br /> <br />At the end of the day, this film radiates with Burton's creative talents. I agree, however, that it is not for all ages. Even some adults will be taken aback by the film's eccentricities, so letting really small kids watch it first might be reconsidered. Keep in mind, however, that the wackiness is the only reason why this might be said -- the film is clean, fresh, and appropriate for children and adults (particularly the young at heart!).  <br /> <br />My suggestion: Let your mind go and relax as you take in the wild world of Willy Wonka. And, if you have the chance, see this film in IMAX -- the true surround sound and size of the screen make it an unbelievable experience. Very highly recommended.
B00005JNQS|3.0|There seems to be 2 camps when it comes down to CGI animated films: Pixar, and everyone else. Those everyone elses' include Dreamworks(Shrek, Madagascar, Antz) and Blue Sky(this film, Ice Age). Looking at the last camp, it clearly shows they're still not at the level as Pixar, simply because the latter companies try to hard to be funny and charming. Their films are practically littered with pop culture references and puns. Well Pixar had that Jurassic Park parody in Toy Story 2 or Raiders of the Lost Ark in Toy Story 1 right? True, but at least it had other things as well. Here it's just one gag/pop culture reference after another and it becomes thin. <br /> <br />Rodney is a robot who wants to be an inventor, like his hero Bigweld of Bigweld Industries. When he goes to Robot City, he finds that not only does Bigweld Industries not accept inventors anymore, they actually don't even have Bigweld run the place. So Rodney is shut out and meets a ragtag group of robots. And you guessed it, he must make everyone band together to stop the corporation. <br /> <br />Now, if it seems like there's a certain \\"I've mentioned this kind of plot before\\" tone in my voice, well then you guessed right. Having a loner group of heroes band together against more stronger enemies has been done before but it's for the kiddies but if you're a kid, you'll most likely like this movie, if you're an adult, you might. <br /> <br />If there's one thing you can count on with animated films is great visuals and of course Robots look great. The images and colors are sharp, robots are really detailed and when they do that rising shot that reveals Robot City you're like \\"wow\\". And this is true throughout the film as well. <br /> <br />Look at the cast list for Pixar films: Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Dave Foley, Richard Kind, Allison Janney and Sarah Vowell. Half of those you can't even figure out where they're from right? We'd actually have to tell you where they're from and you go \\"ohhhhh right!\\" Wellanything non-Pixar is essentially a who's-who of Hollywood talent. Look at this cast list: Ewan McGregor, Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Drew Carey, Albert Brooks, Greg Kinnear. Jeez, it's like that Live Aid charity single on film. Personally a standout was Amanda Bynes, not only for being cute in general but for actually being a bit beyond just a \\"wow is that actually Halle Berry doing a voice?\\" <br /> <br />If you're a kid, you'll love it. If you're an adult, you might like it. And mixed reactions if you're an adult with kids but it'll do its job: keep kiddies entertained for hour and a half.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Star Wars 4: A New Hope<br /><br /> This classic was the first blockbuster, also this movie that gave meaning to the word geek, and gave Halloween something to look forward to.

B00005JNX0|4.0|Jameson Thottam: Animation Review of Madagascar <br /> <br />We've now reached the point in the CG cycle where we no longer ask \\"Is it as good as Pixar?\\" The new question regarding computer animation movies is \\"Is it better than Shark Tale?\\" And considering that \\"Madagascar\\" is the next CG family comedy from DreamWorks, after the aggressively unpleasant \\"Shark Tale,\\" the question takes on a little more relevance. Two \\"Shark Tale\\"s in a row would be a sign of even worse things to come. So it's with much relief and a mild thumbs-up that I assure you: \\"Madagascar\\" is, indeed, better than \\"Shark Tale.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />Since every single CGI family flick is practically guaranteed 150 million bucks at the box office, and this review is therefore entirely unnecessary and actually kind of pointless, I'll keep the review brief.  <br /> <br /> <br />Kid Fun - Jameson L. Thottam <br />If you've got a kid under the age of 12, you'll want to take them to see Madagascar, because they'll probably have a darn good time with it. OK, I know that's not all that lofty of an endorsement; kids are notorious for loving just about any ol' cartoon that's laden with pratfalls, animals, and kooky sound effects. But Madagascar proves to be just charming and witty enough to keep the grown-ups entertained while the rugrats fall into the aisles in peals of hysterical laughter.  <br /> <br />That Old Black Pixar Magic: Jameson Luke Thottam <br />That's not to imply that Madagascar comes close to achieving that seemingly patented brand of Pixar Magic. No, the Pixar movies are clearly in a class by themselves. While something like The Incredibles offers layer upon layer of stunningly satisfying cinematic goodness, a movie like Madagascar is all about high-end animation, amiable silliness, and a whole lot of physical schtick.  <br /> <br />Storyline: Jameson L. Thottam <br />Madagascar is about four goofy animals who (unwittingly) escape from their Central Park zoo, travel across the ocean, andultimately end up stranded in a deep, dark jungle. Our heroes are a lion (Ben Stiller), a zebra (Chris Rock, a hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and a giraffe (David Schwimmer). There are a few rather aimless plot threads about finding one's roots, being loyal to friends, and learning how to deal with the fact that you just might be hungry enough to eat your best friend -- but Madagascar is less about plot than it is about silly animals doing goofy things.  <br /> <br />Voices from the Past: Jameson L Thottam <br />Aside from Schwimmer, the voice-actors seem content to just play themselves, which makes an ironic point: these rather expensive leading men are among the movie's biggest detriments. Say what you will about Mike Myers' Shrek, but at least that guy's using a different voice to help create an animated character. So not for even a second are you \\"getting to know\\" this lion and that zebra. You're just listening to Ben Stiller and Chris Rock as their words spill out of animated mammals. Tough gig, eh fellas?  <br /> <br />I'm sorry but \\"voice acting\\" and \\"speaking into a microphone\\" are not exactly the same thing. And it's irritating that a guy like Ben Stiller can just monotone his way through a performance and earn a huge paycheck while someone like, say, Billy West could have done something truly hilarious with this role.  <br /> <br />But there's some good news on the other side of the coin: Andy Richter gets a lot of solid laughs as a devious penguin, and Sacha Cohen absolutely steals the entire movie as a lunatic lemur. Toss in a few hilarious gags from a pair of wise-guy monkeys, and you're looking at a supporting cast that upstages the stars with no effort whatsoever. OK, fair's fair: David Schwimmer really does have a great voice for animated comedies, but I still stand by this opinion: Nearly all of Madagascar's laughs come from the supporting characters, and from a movie that stars Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, that's a pretty telling statement.  <br /> <br/>Chuckles for all generations: Jameson Thottam <br />Parents, you already know if your kids are going to be dragging you into \\"Madagascar,\\" so I'll save you some stress by telling you that the flick made me laugh with a fairly surprising consistency. Many of the film's best chuckles come courtesy of the fast-paced animation style -- and the rest come from the background penguins, monkeys, and lemurs. My humble advice to the DreamWorks Animation Bureau would simply be this: skip the A-list voice-actors the next time out. The kids are going to line up around the block either way, and without all that excess salary and ego, you're inevitably bound to make a better movie. <br /> <br />Jameson Luke Thottam
B0006VIE4C|1.0|What is his goal? Is he trying to brainwash us into believing that the originals never existed?<br /><br />I owned the complete trilogy DVD set. I really missed StarWars and I was willing to give the new edited versions a chance. The new versions made me feel sick. I had a feeling like I was ripped off. I bought the actual releases, but these new editions made me feel like I was getting cheap Chinese bootlegs. I wanted to relive the experience that I had when I originally saw these movies in the early 80's. They are a huge part of my childhood.<br /><br />It's not too much too ask for double sided disk (one side with the new editions and one with the originals). Spielberg was kind enough to do that with E.T., and Im glad because I also prefered the original.<br /><br />Lucas, why are you doing this to your fans? Please consider the films that you loved as a child. What if those were edited from what you remember them as? Stop questioning the authenticity of the puppets in the movies. I loved the cute puppets more then your power ranger like, CGI aliens.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Star Wars 1: The Phantom Menace<br /><br /> An even longer time ago in a galaxy (that seems to have infinite planets); we witness the beginning of the collapse of a democracy and the rise of an empire, in addition to, the development of a villain of legendary proportions.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the movie stands on special effects. The story has stuff that is never explained in the rest of the series, and what is explained sounds too Eastern Religion.<br /><br /> Unfortuetly childish creatures come again in the form of big talking frogs. Again trying to appeal to children.<br /><br /> Although the actors were very good, the writing they were given was bad. George Lucas wrote it himself, big mistake.<br /><br /> Overall, the movie suffers from bad writing and another childish creature. The special effects are the only thing holding the story together; also, it spends too much time dilly-dallying around exotic environments. The worst out of the Star Wars 3/5 Stars.<br /><br /> Note: See the other three parts of Unbiased Reviews of Star Wars.
B00097DXZS|3.0|Jameson Luke Thottam - Sound Check on \\"All That I am\\" - Santana <br /> <br />It's really hard to not like Carlos Santana. In such a cynical day and time, it's certainly nice to see someone who believes that music really does have the power to affect the spirit. The mark of a true musician (not to mention a true music fan) is to know that music really does have emotional resonance, and because he's aware of that, Carlos will forever be in my good graces.  <br /> <br />Bio of the Master - Jameson Luke Thottam <br />The master guitarist earned his legendary status in the late Sixties/early Seventies, bringing Latin flair to pop music and becoming a guitar hero in an age where there were tons. Although I'm not instrumentally proficient (just a little with guitar/flute and piano), Santana is one of those guitarists whose playing is so unique that I can recognize one of his solos within seconds.  <br /> <br /> <br />The 80's - Jameson L. Thottam <br />His career ground to a halt somewhere around the mid-Eighties. After a decade and a half of being recognized merely for being a legend (and what's wrong with that?), Santana joined forces with a bunch of contemporary superstars for 1999's Grammy-winning, multi million selling \\"Supernatural\\". Matching Carlos's furious guitar riffs with guest artists at the top of their game (Lauryn Hill, Everlast, Rob Thomas, Dave Matthews), \\"Supernatural\\" was a well-deserved success, a solid album, and proof that karma really does exist.  <br /> <br />Now the Review - Jameson Thottam <br />What initially seemed like artists paying tribute began to seem a lot more like a calculated marketing plan by 2002's \\"Shaman\\". While a few collaborations hit the nail on the head (Michelle Branch, Angelique Kidjo), many others sounded like the product of a boardroom meeting with executive producer Clive Davis.  <br /> <br />\\"All That I Am\\", unfortunately, is more of the same. Plenty of the guest artists appear to have been chosen either by mutual label association or by Clive and Carlos looking at the latest copy of \\"Billboard\\". Carlos's guitar is as magical as ever-the best songs on the album feature just Carlos and his guitar-but a lot of these collaborations are forced and unnecessary.  <br /> <br />Exhibit A-the first single.  - Jameson Thottam <br /> <br />After the success of \\"Shaman\\"'s \\"The Game Of Love\\", Carlos reteams with Michelle Branch for \\"I'm Feeling You\\". Now, I think Branch is quite talented. However, \\"Feeling\\" and \\"Game\\" are so similar in sound and melody that they're practically interchangeable. Carlos has not lasted forty years in this industry by shamelessly recycling his own sound, and while \\"I'm Feeling You\\" isn't an awful record, there are definitely points lost here for replicating a sound so closely.  <br /> <br />Carlos fares significantly better on the tracks using his own band and vocalists. \\"Da Tu Amor\\" features some rockin' guitar, but is also smooth enough that you could picture it being played on your local jazz station. Carlos riffs in harmony with the horn section before taking off on a blistering solo and then rejoining the horns. It's a masterful, danceable, energetic performance. \\"El Fuego\\" is salsa/rock of the highest order. Carlos may be Mexican, but his stuff (when not diluted by today's hottest stars) is more in spirit to the stuff my grandparents listened to growing up, like Tito Puente (who was Cuban) and Johnny Ventura (I don't know what he was). At any rate, tracks like these have more organic fire and oomph than the primarily sterile stuff you'll find on the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />It get's worse - Jameson Thottam <br />\\"All That I Am\\" can't even sustain maximum heat when Santana is paired with some of today's hottest soul vocalists. Ordinarily, Mary J. Blige & Anthony Hamilton can make anything sound good, but the results here are mixed. Hamilton's gruff but buttery tenor is put to decent use on the smoldering \\"Twisted\\", but the lyrics are cliched and a step below the meaty stuff Anthony is used to singing. Meanwhile, Blige has never sounded as muted and generic as she does on \\"My Man\\". She also has to endure the indignity of being paired (in duet style-not in guest rapper style) with Outkast's less charismatic half, Big Boi. When Mary unleashes some soulful adlibs towards the end of the record, you're reminded of the magic that could have resulted from this collaboration.  <br /> <br />Some Redemption - Jameson Thottam <br />\\"I Am Somebody\\" features an appealing, jumpy African-style rhythm. Unfortunately, the featured artist on this record is Mr. Stepin Fetchit himself, will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas. It almost sounds like \\"We Are The World\\" or \\"Ebony & Ivory\\" filtered through Fela Kuti. My only thought upon hearing this song was that I miss Wyclef (after all, what are the Peas but The Fugees with more crossover appeal and less talent?). Steven Tyler doesn't do himself any favors either with the anemic \\"Just Feel Better\\". Those of you who cried foul when \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\" came out will be ready to feed Tyler to the wolves after this one.  <br /> <br />Collaborations: Jameson L. Thottam <br />I gotta admit, I was surprised by some of the collaborations here. The songs that I immediately thought I would dislike, I actually turned out to like. Sean Paul proves to be quite charming when he's blessed with a great melody like the one on the moody \\"Cry Baby Cry\\". Joss Stone is little more than window dressing on this track, but it's nice to hear her playing the back and not overemoting. Meanwhile, \\"Brown Skin Girl\\" features \\"American Idol\\" runner-up Bo Bice, and Bice turns out to be fairly appealing for an anonymous pop singer. This track would have fit right in with some of Santana's late 70s/early 80s hits, when the only thing separatidng them from Ambrosia and Toto was the guitar solos.  <br /> <br />Summarizing it All: Jameson L Thottam <br />\\"All That I Am\\" is definitely a mixed bag. The instrumentation (particularly the guitar playing, obviously)is top-notch and probably will continue to be for the remainder of Carlos's career. While it's probably unfair to think that he's ever going to go back to \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and \\"Evil Ways\\", artists like Prince have proven that there's a middle ground between respected relic and unashamed grabs at pop success. I think it might be wise for Carlos to follow that same template. Besides, when your guest list includes Bo Bice, it's probably time to re-think your strategy.  <br /> <br />Jameson Luke Thottam <br />
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This live album is one of the best ever.  As a magazine said it, \\"slipknot is top 10 of the best bands live\\".  I'm not like most of my other friends and like certain songs and so therefore, skip some tracks.  If me and a friend is listening to this and he/she turns it, he/shs's' gonna have a new nose structure.  Anyway, the quality of this album is really good.  Unlike, most other live albums.  Corey directs his audience in almost every song, and shows he cares.  The only problem with this album is that the tracks aren't all from one concert.  They're from all over the world.  In some tracks, he says where he's at.  Like Las Vegas and Pheonix.  I highly recommend this album to anyone.  But beware, not with your parents.  Hes like a cursing machine.  But, its really not that bad.  So stop, looking at the other new albums that came out, and get the one that really matters.  I can't wait for the next studio album.
B00008S2VG|3.0|was because 2003 was THE year that downloading broke BIG.  You only have to read the customer reviews to see that at least 90% of big M's fans loved this album.  everyone had this album a week before it came out and it effected record sales big time.  Now were at the point wear the playing field has evend out and I expect COADF to be huge.  Its allready leaked to the net and I have it.  And yes I plan on buying it when Its released.  Its amazing.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is one of the greatest films i have seen. It is like no other and its style is unparalled. Yes it is violent and such but a very good film with a lot to offer. Great action, acting, story, and amazing visuals.
B00005JO1G|4.0|this movie recieved alot of critizism for its lack of combat scenes. I guess most people think thats about all there is to a war. I love this movie because it gives a good insight into military life and what its really like to go beyond the limited view of our society and to experience first hand what the rest of us watch on CNN in the comforts of our own homes. Alot of people think they know how it is because they see it on TV. Jarhead gives it to you, the straight up in your face no BS truth of a world that most of us will never experience. I think that was one of the main views of this movie. and it really focuses on the soldiers as people... everyday average people with the same problems and emotions as everyone else. I draw my opinion of this movie largely from serving in the armed forces myself. and i dont presume to know everything, if anything, about war. but i do know that there are alot of false assumptions about it, and i hope that this movie helps to clear many of them up.... also read the book, it will explain alot and probably help you to appreciate the movie more.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I think the reviews of Ang Lee's film say more about the reviewer than they do the film. If what you're looking for is slim on story and long on whiz-bang visual effects, then perhaps this \\"Hulk\\" is not for you. If you're satisfied by more explosion than exposition, I'd suggest any number of other comic book movies. <br /> <br />Ang Lee has been vilified for creating here a smart, tight, thoughtful movie that just so happens to be about a comic book (anti)hero. Which means that much of its built-in audience is going to be surprised by what they get in this film: a multilayered story that is rich with subtext; excellent performances by award-winning actors; clever dialogue and assured pacing.  <br /> <br />In other words, for those who love movies, this is a good one.  <br /> <br />Far from perfect, this movie does succumb to summer blockbuster visual effects-itis by the end and for my money it degenerates into noisy racket for the lowest common denominator in the multiplex. However, what fun it is to get there. <br /> <br />This is a much smarter movie than it needs to be, probably better suited to those who are more interested in a good story than to those who want some brainless \\"pow!\\" with their butter-flavored popcorn. There is no doubt that Hulk smash- Hulk smash expectations, Hulk smash conventions, Hulk smash the low-set bar for comic book adaptations. Hulk smash.
1401301010|5.0|I am possibly one of the biggest Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. Anthony's voice is amazing so i picked up the book. The book is amazing, all of the things he went through, and all of the struggles. It's so cool how he was so messed up and got clean. He is my idol.  <br /> <br />YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|This is pretty awful. Perhaps if you think Pink Floyd's Animals is a great album you might like this.  It is a mish mash of different songs in thrown together to make one song.  Not like a blend of different styles. No they play one song like let's say it sound like Queen and then the same song goes to a mellow mexican type song.  Then back to the Queen song then back to the  mellow mexican style song.  Perhaps if you were taking a lot of drugs this might be clever but to me it has the value of a 30 minute drum solo.
0385493622|5.0|In or around 1637, Pierre de Fermat wrote in the margin of a maths book notes describing what became known as Fermatean Triples. He claimed to have found an equation that was hard to solve. \\"I have a truly marvellous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain\\". That one sentence was to tease mathematicians for centuries. The proposition, known as Fermat's Last Theorem, is simple to describe such that even a child can understand it: that there was no solution to the equation \\"a**n + b**n = c**n\\" (where '**' is 'to the power of', a, b, and c are whole numbers greater than 1, and 'n' is greater than 2).     Written like a detective story where the answer is known, this book is easy to follow, and leads readers through a maze of ideas, concepts and subtleties that would be a disaster in the hands of a lesser writer. This is absorbing narrative, leading up to the lecture where Andrew Wiles presented his proof of the non-solution of the equation. However, the proof presented on 23rd June 1993 was the beginning of a nightmare for Wiles, as a serious logic error was subsequently discovered that took an all-consuming 15 months to rescue.     The story of how a very gifted mathematician devoted himself for seven secretive years to a question that others had given up on is only half the tale that Singh tells. It is a journey through some of the history of mathematics, with the solution to the amateur mathematician Fermat's problem being an accidental occurrence. Along the way there are very good insights into the differences between mathematical proofs and scientific proofs; the former must be indisputable, whereas scientific proofs are only ever probabilistically true, and do change as knowledge increases.     There is no need for a great interest in or knowledge of mathematics to enjoy the story, which itself draws the reader onwards. I know nothing of the similarities between modular equations and elliptical equations, tied up within what became known as the Taniyama - Shimura conjecture, yet can appreciate the means by which Wiles was able to prove Fermat's theorem by establishing the mathematical truth of the latter.     Simon Singh started by investigating the story of Andrew Wiles and Fermat for a British television program. This book that he subsequently produced set new levels for the history of science as a popular writing genre. At the end, Singh goes further, and raises questions as to whether the discovery was worth it. If Wiles had not been able to rescue his proof, it is suggested that the effort would not have been in vain, as there were significant advances in mathematic knowledge obtained in the trying. Singh also discusses other difficult areas, and muses on whether some of these will be unprovable, or insoluble. Fermat's Last Theorem, having frustrated the best mathematical brains for over 350 years, is now established, and is not one of the 'unknowable truths of mathematics'!    In concluding, it is fitting to use the words with which Andrew Wiles concluded his 1993 lecture: \\"I think I'll stop here\\".
B000267JQK|5.0|First-thing-first, if you already own DICLAIMER II it's futile to buy DISCLAIMER. However, if you own the first one, I think it's beneficial to buy this one for the extras (new artwork, eight bonus tracks and a DVD). Don't believe what people say about the first 12 tracks are polished studio tracks or as some say the original was rawer cuts. I bought the original release to hear the dissimilarity and there is none. I even played the disc at the same time and the only difference is... some of the tracks have a few seconds blank duration; which means you have to stop the other CD for the tracks will run concurrently. Now with that said, this album was great before the extras. Of course that means that now it's greater. However, I am a bit confused now that I have the orig. DISCLAIMER. In the orig. cover there's a pic of the band and it includes a cutie, Nick Oshiro (drummer) who joined Static-X in 2003. I don't know if he left Seether to join them or if he was disfellowshipped for some personal preference and later joined the Static. I would like to know. In the jacket his thanks includes \\"Dallas Ewing first for accepting this lifestyle - I love you.\\" In the D2 jacket he's only credited for track 19 and Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, etc.) is credited tracks 1 - 12. After doing my homework, Josh is also credited to the drums on Static's albums SHADOW ZONE and BENEATH...BETWEEN...BEYOND... and it's said, START A WAR is the first album that Nick has really worked on. So I guess you can benefit from both DISCLAIMERs if you're like me and want to know who's in the band, where they came from and where they went. Hits \\"Fine Again,\\" \\"Driven Under\\" and \\"Broken.\\" The entire album is splendid! (...)
B000001EL3|5.0|\\"Destroyer\\"(1976). KISS' fifth album.    By the time early 1976 had arrived,even though KISS had only been popular for less than eight months,they had already given themselves the reputation as \\"The Hottest Band in The World\\". And not too long after KISS had become huge overnight due to the success of their double live record \\"Alive!\\" and had began writing and recording material with Alice Cooper collaborater/producer Bob Ezrin,their fifth album,\\"Destroyer\\",came out in March of 1976. How did KISS' fifth album following their breakthrough record meausure up? Read on for my review of this:    This album has often been praised as either the best KISS album or the second best KISS album(right next to \\"Alive\\")and I would have to agree with the legions of KISS fans who say that this is the best KISS record. The biggest hit off of this album,as we all know,was the ballad \\"Beth\\",which Peter Criss wrote and sang for a girlfriend who left him because he had been on the road too much. The whole song is really pretty(especially the piano on it)and Peter Criss does a good job at singing this track with a lot of passion,caring,and concern in his voice. But this album offers far more than just a mega hit off of it. \\"Detroit Rock City\\",a song that was written about a huge KISS fan who died on his way to a KISS concert in Detroit,is a really good and catchy way to open an album and has one of Ace Frehley's best guitar solos,\\"Shout It Out Loud\\" is sort of a \\"Rock and Roll All Nite:Part 2\\" and has a nice rock and roll/feel good feeling to it,and there are plenty of underrated tracks here. \\"Flaming Youth\\" is a very funny song that is sung from the point of view of a teenager who has grown tired with his parents when his parents have grown tired with him,while \\"Sweet Pain\\" is very funny and does a good job at showing Gene Simmons' ego(Simmons himself both wrote and sang that song). I won't give away everything here,but I will say that if you like both KISS and hard rock and you are a rock music collector,if you don't own this album,your collection of rock albums is INCOMPLETE!!!!    As a bonus for this album,it was re-issued and re-released around 1996/1997. There are no bonus tracks here(and why is that???!!!)but the sound on all of the tracks has been digitally remastered(it sounds really good also),Robert V. Conte wrote liner notes(check in the CD case after you take the CD out)about KISS' career around the time before/when/a little bit after this album was released,and the album sheets(which have the lyrics for \\"Detroit Rock City\\" in them,a picture of the KISS army logo,among a few other cool things)are really nice. This is the best record that KISS ever made--enough said.
B000A2H812|4.0|the album is pretty good but after seeing them live twice I was left wanting more. If you have not seen them play live yet, you've done a great dis-service to yourself. I've only seen two rock concerts ever that exceded my expectations to the level that thier live set did (and one of them was when george clinton and p-funk played for 4 hours).
B000AJJNOK|1.0|Rap today is so bad. The golden year of the early to mid 90's are all gone.  Now it's \\"I drilled a ho and smoked some dope and shot some guys and went to the candy shop.\\" God help rap. I wish I could just play some classic Eric B. and Rakim, Gang Starr, Brand Nubian, TCQ, etc., then you would hear what real rap and hip-hop was. My sister keeps bragging about how great this CD is and I just have to pop in \\"Don't Sweat the Technique or Midnight Marauders\\" to show her what rap is. Rap sucks today. 50 Cent is the today's rap king(why?) and he is leading it into the ground. Heis absolutely killing it. That's just too bad. Mainstream rap is pure garbage.
B000059QYB|4.0|Billy's songs sound just as fresh as they did back then, and it was wonderful to rediscover them.  But, the last 20 seconds or so of the last cut, Don't You Forget About Me has a buzz of some sort.  The buzz is especially noticeable on an iPod.  I took the first CD back for exchange, and the same problem was on the second.  If you're a purist about your music, be prepared to grit your teeth.  Really, the music companies should have better quality control, since they refuse to refund your money when they put out defective products.
0375703764|5.0|...or maybe it isn't.  The term \\"cult classic\\" gets thrown around a lot, but Mark Danielewski's House of Leaves is one book that has definitely earned the title.  This is the kind of work that inspires the admiration of many and the fierce devotion of a select few.  The book itself defies easy description, but I'll give it a shot anyway.  I've got time, even if I may not quite have the words.  Anyway, House of Leaves, much like some other notorious brain-teasers (think Gravity's Rainbow and Infinite Jest) presents the reader with a multi-levelled narrative with more twists and turns than the dwelling that gives the book its title.  It's superficially the story of an aimless tattoo-shop apprentice, Johhny Truant, who discovers disorganized writings scattered about the apartment of a dead blind octagenarian known only as Zampano, and finds himself irresistibly drawn to the herculean task of organizing everything into a coherent form.  Zampano's writing itself, for its part, is the tale of a fictional documentary film called the Navidson Record, recorded with some help by a Pulitzer-winning photographer named Will Navidson.  And the documentary (the description of which makes up the bulk of the book) tells the story of Navidson's and his family's move into a house in Virginia with some, er supernatural qualities.  Not to mention, Truant regularly interrupts his transcription to inject some personal notes regarding his own experiences and thoughts while telling Zampano's story, which turn out to be rather extensive.  Confused yet?<br /><br />Well, it's not supposed to be light reading, but House of Leaves provides plenty of payoff for the dedicated.<br /><br />Essentially, this book obliterates the traditional barriers of the novelistic form, presenting the reader with an unconventional, semi-linear narrative that's vast in scope and exacting in detail.  In the end, though, the novel's literary experimentation, while interesting and distinctive, isn't the reason to read it, or at least not the best one.  Rather, you should read this book because beneath all the bold innovations and encyclopedic knowledge of its author there's a real heart that elevates it above the merely pretentious.  The obvious comparisons to David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest have already been made (in fact, I think I just made one), but there's an important difference to be noted as well.  Where Infinite Jest generally sees Wallace holding himself at a distance from his subjects, observing them with the sort of clinical detachment characteristic of a lab experiment, Danielewski's novel boasts a striking level of emotional depth, giving a dramatic weight to its supernatural story.<br /><br />While it really is a huge task to try to take it all on in a mere internet review, suffice to say that the totality of House of Leaves turns out to be nothing less that a fully realized epic that can engage your brain,  pull at your heartstrings, and crush your soul at the same time.  Danielewski clearly knows how to write a good scary story, but even more importantly, he manages to get you invested in his characters and *their* stories.  Writing through Zampano writing through Johnny Truant, Danielewski turns the tale of Will Navidson, his family, and a house that's bigger on the inside than the outside into a catologue of love, loss, regret, and fear.  The interpersonal dynamics that unfold end up becoming just as interesting as the descriptions of the vast interior of a house that seems to change shape as soon as anyone starts to figure it out.  Danielewski's writing manages the difficult task of achieving its own sort of poignancy without seeming to try for it, often in strange places--just check out the descriptions of the picture that got Navidson the Pulitzer.<br /><br />Then there's the parellel narration by Johnny Truant, mostly incorporated through footnootes, that's probably more frightening than anything in the main narrative of the novel. Befitting the subject matter of the novel, Truant is a lost soul living around the fringes of society when he discovers Zampano's body and the work he never finished, but there's nothing to prepare him or the reader for the insanity that quickly starts to set in.  Truant's writing paints a picture of mounting dread and disorientation as his task of transcribing Zampano's writing becomes more and more of an obsession, with his writing becoming increasingly claustrophobic as his world begins caving in around him.  Even his usual forms of self-medication-booze, drugs, sex-cease to give him comfort against the overwhelming weight that his task comes to assume.  The despair captured in his words isn't always fun to read, but it had me glued to the page just the same.<br /><br />I could probably write about fifteen more paragraphs on this book if I were so inclined, but it would still be difficult for my mediocre ramblings to do it justice.  Cliched thought it may sound, House of Leaves really is one book that must be read to be believed.  The novel has been around a long time now, but I know of few that achieve the combination of originality, depth, and intelligence that Danielewski pulls off here.  You can stick this one on the short list of postmodern classics.the subject matter of the novel, Truant is a lost soul living around the fringes of society when he discovers Zampano's body and the work he never finished, but there's nothing to prepare him or the reader for the insanity that quickly starts to set in.

B000002NJS|3.0|Nice music, but *cough* somebody's been listening to Tori Amos albums. Maybe some ZooTV period U2 in there, too.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|SlipKnoT 9.0 is SlipKnoT's newist cd. It is a live CD that we all know. And live cds are pretty much all sucky. If you never heard SlipKnoT live before or heard other live songs from other bandz you might be thinking it might not be good. Many bandz can't ppull off putting out a live cd, becuz they just plane suck live. <br /> <br />To SlipKnoT this was no challange. SlipKnoT is one of the best bandz live. I have heard some songs from SlipKnoT live before, in concert and on some cds. And It impresed me, once I knew that SlipKnoT's new album 9.0 was going to be live I couldn't wait. SlipKnoT's live shows are full of pure energy. The only bad part about the CD is that you can't see the energy you cant see them playing. You can only see that live or wacthing the Disasterpiece DVD. <br /> <br />This is a great CD by SlipKnoT and I am very happy to Add it to my collection of SlipKnoT CDs, 12' and 7' recordz. You can hear everyone from SlipKnoT from Corey screams to Sid's Scracthing to Pauls Bass. It is a very good CD. And a lot of people say crap about Coreys voice and it soundz like he is whining. Give him a break. They have been touring non-stop ever sence V3 came out. It is a greta live cd, you gwt a chance to hear Chris and Clowns backing vocals. Which I just love and you don't get that on the SlipKnoT cds, only live. You also get to hear Joey's Drum Solo which is pretty good. Another bad thing I will say about this album (but its not really bad) is that there is no Sid solo. <br /> <br />Overall this cd is amazing, you get everything you ever wanted in a live cd. The sound quality is amazing for a live cd. You hear everything, but sometimes it is hard to hear Sid. If your a big maggot like I am you are going to love this CD. I really recomend buying this live album. SlipKnoT 9.0 is a great album and you will not be sorry owning it. Be sure to keep a look out for SlipKnoT's new DVD set to be released in March 2006.
B00000IMTH|5.0|While many regard RISING as the best RAINBOW CD, this one gets my vote. LONG LIVE ROCK 'N ROLL is a great listen from beginning to end. Great guitar work by Blackmore, and Dio's vocals are incredible as always. The 'Gates of Babylon' is one of the highlights, although it's difficult to pick 'highlights' from such a strong set of songs! Simply put, this is a great CD! If you don't have it, I feel sorry for you!
0307263118|5.0|John Banville has produced an incredible book in \\"The Sea\\". Here he has a person Max Morden who has returned to the coastal town where he spends his holiday to confront his ghosts. He has lost his wife to cancer. Everywhere around, the language protrays the death initially beautifully. He cannot be rid of it. It is a sense of longing and trying to cling to the past, which can be addictive. The passion with which he describes his wife is wonderful, he leaves to image his wife and relationship that he would have had with her. The prose in the book is outstanding. His memories of sex, summer, sadism, status-anxiety and cinemas are patched-together fragments, wrought clichs of high European culture sourced in Freud, Proust and Nabokov. The author calls himself an autodidact. The book is laden with traces of Beckett and Dostoevsky and is a pleasure to read for the way the story is portrayed. It is sad that a lot of criticism about the book has been made, including one reviewer saying that it is beautifully written but has little story. I, for one found this better than a number of Booker winners, including the last few. <br /> <br />As in all cases, he remembers another family from his past when he was very young, the Graces, who he thinks are very glamorous, he is torn between life and death. The complete landscape is an anatomy of life and death and is beautifully portrayed. The book is an incredible one, though sad at times. It shows the variety and depth of the author and how deeply he describes scenes to make us see the analogies between the scenes and the moods of the person. This is one of the best novels of the year and a pleasure to read. Some of the best parts of the book are where he compares the changes that happened in the world, specifically with marriage. In his time, he had no problem with marrying his wife despite all the pros and cons that he faced. The present day world prefers taking partners. Now he has a beautiful paragraph that says partners usedto refer to someone you dance or to a person you have a business with, how did it come to refer to someone you love. After all it is true that the amount of committment one has for a business or for a dancer is much less than that for a person whom one has married to. The other place that will break your heart is where his wife when she is ill starts to tell that there where times in the past when they were human and used to hate each other, implying that they are not human anymore. One relishes the story as much as the way it is portrayed. To put it in the author's language, this is no quotidian book and every chapter has uniqueness that one would go back and reread.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I saw this glorified snuff film with Monty Python's \\"Life of Brian\\" on a double feature. While Gibson displays a certain puckish wit in his depiction of the last days of the historical Jesus, he has nothing like the superbly satiric edge that the Python troupe bring to this evergreen yarn.  <br /> <br />Always look on the bright side of Life!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005NTJK|5.0|Sure, Aqualung and Thick as A Brick are better-known. But Benefit is arguably the group's best record, rivaled only by the equally great Stand Up. Anyway, this is where the group's English Folke/hard rock fusion took off. Great results. With You There To Help Me establishes that from the first, Anderson's sage-like vocals and lyrics are strong in their own right, but add that to the flute/guitar interplay during the last minute? I'm sold! The more traditional hard rocker Nothing to Say is also brilliant, sounds like Anderson's making some social critique here, well even if he isn't (it's hard to tell with his lyrics) it's still great! The next track on the CD version (Alive and Well and Living In) continues this streak, love that piano melody! The mini-suite Son does a good job of balancing the folk/hard rock thing: Heavy metal first part, acoustic bridge, back to the metal. It's funny, too! Not side-splitting, but dry-humored like the rest of Anderson's work. For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me is similar - a folksy, fingerpicked acoustic guitar drives the verses, but then the ever-underrated Martin Barre's electric guitar kicks in for the head-banging choruses. The vaguely psychadelic To Cry You a Song is arguably the best track here - menacing double-tracked vocals, a good guitar riff, solid lyrics... though I would've liked to hear a bit more of Anderson's flute on this one. For the record, this tune got the group unfairly labeled as junkies because of the opening line (\\"flying so high\\"), which turned out to be an Eight Miles High-esque faux pas. Ironically, in both song's cases the \\"flying high\\" thing refers to a plane. The quick little blurb A Time for Everything? muses about time, how maybe its passing isn't all that bad, though it can hurt. Nice little tune there. The record comes dangerously close to falling apart at this point - Inside and Play in Time are the weak tunes. Then there's the lovely little Sossity; You're a Woman, a very Medival sounding tune.<br /><br />Bonus tracks! The best is the \\"original UK mix\\" of Teacher, for some reason tacked on the end instead of in its original sequencing order. I'm not complaining though - the funky hard rocker, with philisophical-but-funny lyrics and Ian's best flute performance on the record, is one of my favorite Tull tunes. And why weren't the wah-wah'ed, low-key Singing All Day and folk tune Witch's Promise not included as part of the original release? What a shame. As for just trying to be... eh.<br /><br />In my mind, Tull's best period was from 1969-1971 in which they put out three excellent records (Stand Up, this one and Aqualung). After that, they sorta died - Thick as a Brick was O.K., but overlong. Their only good disc after that was Minstrel in the Gallery.<br />Bonus tracks!

0385720920|5.0|This book caught my immediate attention from the first page.  It's definitely a page turner with lots of twists and turns... alot of unexpected plots.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who loved \\"Fight Club\\", enjoys sarcastic humor or likes the darker side of things.
B000BB1MHS|1.0|Save your money folks!!  Or better yet buy the 1971 ORIGINAL starring Gene Wilder.  This Johnny Depp hokum fails in every department.  Nothing can compare to the 1971 classic which is superior to this disaster.  The 1971 classic even has one of the most beautiful and engaging musical scores ever with the haunting tune \\"IMAGINATION\\".  Hollywood fails again trying to top a classic that CANNOT EVER BE TOPPED!!  Watching this made me want to get the original even more...which is exactly what I did!!  That one merits 5 stars and more!!  This Johnny Depp film is pure garbage!
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Okay, I admit it...being the lizard-like, cold-blooded soul that I am, while everyone else at the perennial and prerequisite holiday parties are jamming and singing along to the usual Xmas fare, I'm more likely to be the cast-off on the fringe who's protesting all these cold-weather shenanigans, defiantly listening to The Beach Boys cheerfully singing the praises of surfin' here in the USA or doing the strip in your daddy's T-Bird or War cruzin' with the 8-track player goin' on my iPod. Can't be helped, being the 90 degree, summer kinda guy I am these days.<br /><br />But then Diana in her imitable way comes along and blows all that wintry ill-will right out the door; to be blind-sided by such a tasty collection of holiday treats is something I will never mind, even if I didn't necessarily see it coming.  The arrangements never stray far from anything I haven't heard previously, the playing by all involved is never ever adventurous but more on the slumbered side of relaxed, and song selection is for the most part the usual oh-so-holiday predictable. But then the intangible is Krall's own silken, jazzy vocals; from the opening selection, 'Jingle Bells', to the closing 'Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep', Krall gracefully manages to entrance and enthrall this usual holiday skeptic, so much so that longings for toasty temperatures and an endless line of margaritas are forgotten (well, at least until the next time I have to bundle up to go walk the dog).<br /><br />Perhaps it's because Diana Krall's 'Christmas Songs' reminds me of the swinging songs (holiday and otherwise) my parents used to love to play: Sinatra, Martin, Cole, Torme, Como...with a small doses of London--Julie, that is--mixed in for good measure (I say 'small' because Mom did have issues with the, ahem, 'flavor' of her musical content...but Dad, bless him, always managed to sneak a bit of her music onto the old console anyways). Krall's own voice has always reminded me of Julie London's, and perhapsthat's the key to thawing my frozen heart. But never mind my pining nostalgic, self-analytic psycho-babble--or perhaps very much because of it--'Christmas Songs' manages quite well to hit that old soft spot for me. Christmas Past has never felt more present than while I'm listening to this holiday collection.<br /><br />Forget about waxing your board this week, park the '69 Camaro street rod for the winter...delve into Diana Krall's gift to this holiday season and let the seasonal cheer meld into your soul...it worked for me (actual unprovoked testimonial...however, your mileage may vary due to how far north of the Equator you reside during this time of year).

B0000640VN|4.0|The plot and acting in this movie were great and the chemisty between Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman was wonderfull but the movie went too slow at times.<br /><br />In the movie we met Leopold a guy from the 19th century. When he follows Stuart too the newly built bridge he finds himself in another century. Stuart who is trying to comvince a stubborn Kate that Leopold is really from the 19th century winds up in the hospital and Leopold is left on his own in a time where things are different. Kate who doesn't become convinced finds herself falling in love with Leopold and he returns the feeling. When it is time for Leopold to go back we soon find out about a twist and Kate has too find a way back to his time period and change events. So will Kate be able to do it?<br /><br />This movie is a very good romantic comedy and Jackman and Ryan are at their best. If you are fan of romantic comedies and want something to watch on a boring day this movie is for you. And if you've always wanted to see Jackman in 19th century clothing you'll love it.<br /><br />Penny Lane
B000BW7QWW|5.0|....because I am addicted in the best possible way. I am going to go into greater detail and gush my brains out when I write my review of the box set of the TV series, but suffice to say: Every positive/gushing review you are reading here is dead-on. Went and saw the movie Friday night, after allowing myself the privilege of seeing the TV series in its entirety on DVD (I didn't want to watch the movie not knowing its beginnings.) The movie, to borrow a time-worn cliche', was all that and a bag of chips. When I went to look in the newspaper Friday afternoon to see if it was still showing here in the Kansas City area, it was at ONE THEATRE, at a location quite a distance from where I live. Very worth the drive and the $$. I want to go see it again. Will more than likely own both the TV series and the movie on DVD very soon.<br /><br />The humor in the movie is more pronounced than in the TV series, which is a good thing--humor added to plots that are serious, when well done, is always a welcome thing. In watching the \\"extras\\" included in the TV series DVD, it is mentioned somewhere that they could not have found better actors to play the roles, and anyone with a modicum of intelligence would agree. It was like these 9 wonderful people were born to play these parts...to hear Nathan state categorically that this is \\"the best job he's EVER had\\" and to hear Ron say that he still gets \\"teary-eyed\\" at the thought of the series being over is both gratifying and heart-wrenching. Unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool cynic or someone with a heart of stone, you can't help but love these characters and the stories they get plunged into. If this movie was Joss Whedon's way of saying thank you to his hordes of Fireflies, then I guess all we can say is you're welcome, Joss. Let's hope we see a sequel, and that certain unexpected turns of events in the movie are brought to happier conclusions.
0823016285|5.0|I came across this book when looking for something reference-oriented for experienced artists, and I was immediately impressed. The author has a real knack for breaking down the geometry and muscle dynamics of the human head and face in a way that's easy to remember (my favorite part) and exhaustively presented, and each page is covered with pictures that convey these points very well visually. For me, it will be very useful for helping to call general points to mind when drawing from memory. I also thought the use of drawings based on actual photographs afforded a certain realism and immediacy even to the more fanciful diagrams (like the skull cutaway that shows the underlying bone structure in the same style as everything else) that Hogarth never quite manages.    In any case, the book is put together very well, and would probably useful for 3D artists as well -- who, like anybody else coming at this book, already know a little bit about the technical aspects of what they're doing and stand to gain a lot from a more in-depth look at the human face itself.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie has been my long-standing favorite for quite some time now.  I have a penchant for British actors and movies, and Love Actually is my pinnacle. <br /> <br />It's amazing how so many different story lines can fit together so beautifully.  From the lonely book writer, the heartbroken wife, and the hormonally unstable young man, each person's struggle grabs at your heartstrings.   <br /> <br />The movie's intro alone, is enough to earn 5 stars.  It still gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it.

0385338686|4.0|Samantha, an up-and-coming lawyer at a prestigious London firm, is a workaholic. Billing hours must be high in order to make partner. When one day a grave mistake is discovered and all fingers point to Samantha as being responsible for it, she panics, runs, and looses her job as well as the opportunity of a partnership that was at her doorstep. She will end up in a town that she doesn't know and will be hired, inadvertently, as a housekeeper.  Of course, having spent all of her time on her legal career, as did her mother, she never learned how to cook, or clean, or do anything around the house. <br /> <br />Such is the premise of this new book authored by Sophie Kinsella. The difference between this novel and her previous works is that her main character is not a superficial person; she actually is very smart and has (or had) a lucrative and respectable career. She just happens to be useless with an oven and a washing machine! She will however get some help on how to perform her new tasks, but there will be some mishaps along the way that will make you smile.  <br /> <br />In all chick-lit fiction, there is also a love interest. In this book, the gorgeous gardener plays this role. A little clich, but he does act the part of the strong silent type that is not fooled by Samantha's claims of being a master chef, but will help her to improve her skills and so continue fooling her employers. <br /> <br />If I had a choice to either read this novel or one from the Shopaholic series, I wouldn't hesitate a single minute in choosing this book. The characters are fun, the situations are interesting and well written, and as you read it you can see the potential for a chick-flick quite clearly. There are some issues that are touched on, such as the impact that workaholism has on a family, for example, that appears between Samantha and her mother. These moments add a good dose of humanity to the people in this story, and give a little bit of depth to the story that would otherwise be only about a klutzy lawyer trying to boil and egg. As Samantha settles into her new job, she will also wonder whether or not she could ever go back to her old life. <br /> <br />I do recommend this book if you enjoy this category of literature.  <br />

0446310786|5.0|In the scene where Atticus leaves the courtroom and the child ren are told to rise in their father's honor along with the black people, I tear up everytime. I find it to be a quiet memorial to his diligence in the name of justice, truth, honesty, dignity and the equality of all. It is a show of re spect for a man of immense honor and fairness. It is an act of quiet desperation in the face of overwhelming injustice, prejudice, racism and bigotry. It is all they can give to him but it speaks volumes. I share the novel each year with my 10th grade students and each year, they say, \\"I love this book\\". I am honored to be in the presence of students who perhaps for the first time in their lives \\"feel\\" the injustice and prejudice that far too many prople have been subjected to for numerous reasons. I also love the evolving maturity and love in the unusual Finch family. I see the family representing many feel ings that are unspoken in my students' eyes. Through the eyes of Scout and out of the mouth of a babe we see and hear about our educational and judical system. We see prejudice, love, family, neighborhood, life, death, mystery, uniqueness, kind ness, hatred, ignorance, mistrust. We feel the depth and breadth of emotion. It is a story worth telling, reading, dis cussing more than once. When Scout says \\"Heh, Boo.\\" She sees inside of him. She sees the inner man and looks beyond the exterior delivering the message to all of us....\\"Heh, Boo.\\"\\" <br />

0804106304|4.0|If you have a mother, and I know you do, then there is a great possibility you will resonate with the stories of The Joy Luck Club.  Be ready for the unexpected tugs at your heart and the moments when you remember fondly your childhood.   Through the stories of four sets of mothers and daughters, we experience loyalty to traditions, wedding rituals, and the realization that the new generations are always different.    <br />There is some difficulty pronouncing the names the Chinese women, but it is essential to the integrity of the book, and to the experiences these women have in Americanized San Francisco.   Through the means of storytelling, the voice of each woman shares her thoughts, allowing the reader to enjoy several stories quilted into one.  The final heart warming story is of the reuniting of three sisters who had never met, yet they all see their one mother in each other. <br />I am privileged to have a close Chinese friend whose extended family lives in Chinatown of San Francisco, and while attending the annual Chinese New Year parade one year, we dined with several of her aunts and uncles, who found everything hilariously funny at my (non-Asian) expense and ordered the traditional chicken feet and other cultural delicacies.  I am embarrassed to say I only ate rice for that entire meal.     Chicken feet and human flesh in soup are merely a taste of what you will find in Amy Tan's book.  Enjoy.   <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|...about the impact of this movie. <br /> <br />What I know is that, as I write this (and the last 6 weeks since the movie was released), that movie history is surely being made.  A television show which is hugely popular but still is cancelled, a fandom which is overwhelmingly proud and will not let go of its dream, a movie which follows so wonderfully and carefully (thanks to its creator) within its origins... <br /> <br />This movie ls a miracle, we know that.  It's also a fine example, the best I know of, of a movie produced when the writer/director has the imput to realize his/her vision. <br /> <br />OH MY.  This is a Damn Good Scifi Movie!!! <br /> <br />Thank you, Mutant Enemy!  :)
B00005ATQ8|5.0|1 of Kubrick's best.  Incredible dialogue, wonderful story, an even an inspired performance by Ryan O'Neal.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This was the album that really got me into Fleetwood Mac.  I had already heard and liked their radio hits, but after listening to this album, I went back to give them a more detailed look.  It was a very ambitious project and features what is simply unabashed great song writing.  In many ways, it sounds like a progressive rock album; many of the tracks have a certain surreal quality to them, notably \\"Murrow Tunring Over in His Grave\\", \\"Red Rover\\", and \\"Say Goodbye\\".  Lindsey Buckingham once again proves his amazing guitar talent, combining electric guitar pyrotechnics with acoustic delicacy, as well as fast-and-furious acoustic finger-picking.  Stevie Nicks shows some great vocal versatility in songs like \\"Come\\" and \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave\\".  John McVie and Mick Fleetwood are also strong and solid, providing an excellent range of percussion and rhythm to the songs on this album.  It is wonderful to see a veteran band proving so innovative on continued studio efforts - I hope to hear many more.  This is definitely an album worth having.
B00097DXZS|5.0|Now give me a break people.  To all the negative reviewers out there.  There is only one thing to say to all of you. \\"GET A LIFE\\"  This album is awesome.  There is soooo much talent on this album its definitley a keeper but what am I not saying that every \\"True\\" Santana fan doesnt already know.   This is a collectors item.  Another thing to all the non-TRUE-Santana fans.  If a legend like Santana or any other legend invites you to be on his album. Im sorry to dissapoint all of you but those invited singers DO HAVE \\"TALENT\\"  and are either already legends or will be in the long run. Now for the knocks on Bo Bice c'mon people pretty lame on your part.  All of you probably wish it was you in his place.........In other words you probably wouldnt know talent if it bit you........After all that....You should buy this CD.
0060528737|5.0|My only regret about Abhorsen is that it did not last long enough.  I closed the book with a deep sigh and a sense of frustration that there was not (yet) another book in the series for me to read. Luckily, I got the feeling from some of the developments at the end that Nix might plan on returning to the world of Abhorsen in the future.<br /><br />As a fit conclusion to the dark and moody magical world created in Sabriel and Lirael, Abhorsen should not be read first. Potential readers should begin at the beginning and work forward from there. The entire series appeals to both adults and younger readers, and Abhorsen is no exception to that trend.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King's IT is a story about 7 strugglin' kids who live in a town called Derry, Maine in which the town has history of children disappearing without a trace, in which Derry, Maine is a labeled as a small, dirty hick town, that is haunted, creepy, homophobic, snobby, racist, mysterious, anti-semitic, bullies, and just ignorant opressed elderly people (in which you read in the book)that is haunted by a strange creature that contacts to dopey little kids.  The creature can disguise itself of anything that the kids fear, such as It disguised as a Clown named \\"Pennywise\\".  Pennywise likes to offer people balloons to hypnotize them with its Dead Lights so Pennywise The Dancing Clown traps them into his Lure.<br /><br />Part II of IT, Mike Hanlon (the Black Guy), calls up his 6 other friends to warn them that IT has come back to Derry, Maine in which all of the other 6 kids have went their own seperate ways, the funniest part like what hockeyplaya187 said, when Pennywise is in the Library laughing & criticizing that one guy because he was talking to chicks under his age, then Pennywise releases blood-filled balloons & tells crazy jokes!  The only way people can see \\"IT\\" is if they look through the Dead Lights behind Pennywise, though in the shelter thing near the swamps, you can also see the Dead Lights creeping around pipes in the sewers.  To bad \\"IT\\" like hockeyplaya187 said, the creature is a Giant Spider that the Dead Lights are on its belly, to bad all they had to do is shoot the Spider at its Dead Lights, then it was weak, then they just jump the Spider and tear out it's heart & IT dies!  Good & Long Movie, Remember!
B0000C8AVE|5.0|It's almost impossible to put Bob Dylan's music in the context of when it was first released, as he is going on forty-plus years of fame and icon status in most learned musical circles. It's hard to hear the songs he penned, seen through the lens of what they came to mean and what they continue to mean, as if they were new, sparkling examples of a talent just beginning to be realized.<br /><br />All of which makes hearing \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\", his 1963 sophmore album (after a self-titled debut the year before) all the more impressive. With just his guitar and harmonica, Dylan manages to weave his way through social protest, love and loss, and story-songs like the gifted folk poet that he was first sold to the world as. Before he went electric, Dylan became the darling of the folk movement through songs like \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\", \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\", \\"Masters of War\\", and all these are presented in the exceptional technical format that maximizes their beauty and stark evocations of subject matters both political and personal.<br /><br />It's the spit and anger of \\"Masters of War\\" that many people will probably take away from this record, but don't forget the humorous side; as showcased in some of his best tracks from the mid-Sixties, Dylan was not born missing a sense of humor. \\"I Shall Be Free\\", in particular, is one of the funniest tunes committed to record. \\"Talking World War III Blues\\", \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\", and \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" make for a humorous aside to the more strident sloganeering that Dylan engages on. \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" sees Dylan backed by a sparse band, and it is entirely possible that the original album would have been more along those lines had not Dylan's manager at the time sought to court the folk audience and shun the rockers who might have grasped Dylan back then.<br /><br />I have to confess that I was hesitant to purchase this; as a fan of the \\"electric years\\" (starting with the masterpieces contained on \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\"), I was reluctant to hear some of the folk material. But this album could very well be the perfect introduction to Dylan; it contains classic songs that any artist would give their right arm to pen (and many would cover), and flows perfectly from one tune to the next. There's not a bad note on the album.<br /><br />If you want to hear Dylan, you must hear \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". You owe it to yourself to get this album, and prepare to put it on repeat at least seven or eight times the first time you play it. It's that damn good, and I don't know how else I can emphasize that.g It All Back Home\\"), I was reluctant to hear some of the folk material.

0525948023|5.0|Another superb work of timely importance.<br /><br />While Mr. Tolle's past works have made many references to the ancient spiritual teachings of the East, and there are still quotes and stories from many different traditional paths to truth here, Eckhart seems to have more of an intent of reaching my Christian brothers and sisters with this work.<br /><br />Within the book are countless references to stories and quotes from this ancient teacher and the Bible in general.<br /><br />Eckhart takes time to clarify many of the teachings of Jesus in a direct, modern context one can understand with out the confines of dogma, ideology or organized religion and brings transformative power and vibrancy back to the these ancient stories and quotes.<br /><br />In a time when fundamentalist Christianity has a strong-hold in the United States and elsewhere, this book can elucidate the true timeless spiritual message for those who are ready to see.<br /><br />We also get more personal stories here of Mr. Tolle himself to draw from as examples to illustrate his points.  Some of them quite humorous.<br /><br />Please read this book and help create the New Earth as you help create the new YOU.<br /><br />Thank you for sharing the dance.<br /><br />\\"The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse\\" -Walt Whitman
0385504209|3.0|I finally got around to reading this immensely popular book (as indicated by over 3000 reviews in this site, and the fact that this book is still in the best selling section of most book shops). After finishing its 450 pages, I am not sure whether to hail it as a masterpiece or dismiss it as a racy, suspense thriller.  There is no question that the book is a page turner, and Dan Brown integrates the history of the holy grail, Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, pagan rituals, etc., in the story very cleverly and seamlessly. The parts of the book that describe the Priory of Sion, knights templar, holy grail, Mary Magdalene, Da Vinci's works, phi, etc., are fascinating. (Being no authority on these subjects, I cannot, however, comment on their authenticity.)<br /><br />On the other hand, the sudden and unexpected twists in the plot, at times, appear a little too convenient (better suited for movies perhaps). The characters are also far fetched and are portrayed as super humans without much depth. I am obviously not with the large section of people who consider this to be a work of genius, but I am still glad I read this book. I give it three stars.

B000000H6D|5.0|This is indeed the definitive Type O Negative album. Nowhere else are you going to find an album of textured, delicate, thrashing metal and beauty like this, and you can try but none are quite like BLOODY KISSES. Arguably the best Type O album (their whole catalog, minus the so-so ORIGIN OF THE FECES, is brilliant), BLOODY KISSES was the first Type O album to go platinum, thanks in large part to the epic menace of \\"Black No. 1\\", an eleven minute brood about hair dye. But \\"No. 1\\" wasn't the only good song on this album. It's the masterpiece of the record, but not the only good tune to be found. <br /> <br />The creepy cover of Seals and Crofts \\"Summer Breeze\\", which slows down the up-tempo original version to the ultimate Type O style ballad, is actually clever (there are alternate words than the ones you'll find on here, and they quite funny). You have the nearly nine-minute mini-epic scope of \\"Christian Woman\\", another song that should have been just as big as the predecessor, creepy in the first segment, haunting in the second segment, and during the \\"J.C. Looks Like Me\\" segment, they get heavy and thrash like metal gods. The title track is an epic in its own right, very dark, slow-paced, and menacing. \\"Suspended In Dusk\\" can be found on this version of BLOODY KISSES and its worth the price if you can find the digipack. Sadly, \\"Machine Screw\\", \\"Kill All The ----People\\", and the shorter bits are only found on the standard version. Both versions are actually no better than the other, but the digipack has an advantage by containing \\"Suspended In Dusk\\".  <br /> <br />Either way, you can't go wrong with either version of this masterpiece album. While no classic in its own right, BLOODY KISSES has just about earned that status as the \\"classic\\" Type O Negative album. Selling well over millions of copies by now, BLOODY KISSES is the definitive Type O.
B00092ZMDY|1.0|The info on Amazon did not state this album only plays in stereo and DTS 5.1, not in Dolby Digital 5.1. Not much fun watching the old guys preforming in old stereo technology, so I only lasted part way through the first song.. Amazon needed to add that appropiate info.
B000000H57|4.0|BLOODY KISSES established Type O Negative as one of the biggest goth-type hard rock groups of all time. While showcasing epic songs and vampiric vocals, KISSES brought Type O into the spotlight, earning them a rabid fanbase and winning some critics over in impressive fashion. OCTOBER RUST turns up the melodic elements of Type O Negative, while the hard thrash mostly takes a backseat here, but make no mistake...this is still a beautifully crafted metal monster. <br /> <br />The two opening tracks, one untitled the other \\"Bad Ground\\" are meant to be sarcastic, as they explain on track #2. But \\"Love You To Death\\" is quite possibly one of the most beautiful love ballads Type O has ever written, and its the more melodic metal that you're likely to find throughout the album. Highlights include the stomping cover of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\"; the incessantly catchy dirge of \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\"; the semi-creepy haunt of \\"Haunted\\"; and the beautiful yet transparently sick \\"Wolf Moon\\", which is an ode to a woman's monthly friend crossed with a little lycanthropic element. \\"Die With Me\\" is probably the lightest song Type O have committed to album, but it's got some clever and funny lyrics, some sweet but also darkly sarcastic. \\"In Praise of Bacchus\\" features a guest vocal spot from Pist-On's princess Valium, and the duet with her and Peter is quite good.  <br /> <br />Peter was quoted as saying that OCTOBER RUST would showcase a \\"more melodic side\\" of Type O Negative. Throughout most of the album, it is indeed a more melodic and toned down record, emphasizing more melody over thrash and dark metal. While this album might not be to everyone's liking, OCTOBER RUST is the \\"melodic\\" side of Type O Negative.
0385504209|5.0|I love this book! The history in it is so interesting, as are the codes and theories. It brings up many ideas that have never been truely publicized so much before. If you are a close-minded person, don't read it. Even if you don't agree, the book is well written, gripping and interesting with a touch of romance and some slight humour.
B00005JNTX|5.0|One of the best movies of 2005, Sin City has action, horror, and spectacular visuals; all you need is a strong stomach and a twisted sense of humor.  I've never read the graphic novels, so I won't be doing a comparison to those, just a review from a happy moviegoer who loves it when style and substance meld together to form a visual treat like Sin City.<br /><br />The plot is simply mayhem and revenge, cops and criminals, in a dark world of concrete and sin.  There's lots of blood, Tarentino style, but most of it is in black-and-white so it cuts down on the squishiness.  The plot is not what you want to buy this movie for.  Buy it for the absolutely spectacular and stylized photography and visuals, and the stunning performances of the cast.<br /><br />Bruce Willis aptly and perfectly plays Hartigan, with his \\"Diehard-deadpan\\" style.  Mickey Rourke is legend in Sin City as Marv, I doubt you will recognize him at first.  The hardest, baddest, meanest, toughest, most vile criminal on the streets, and someone you can root for.<br /><br />Clive Owen (King Arthur) puts his arrogantly serious handsomeness to work as Dwight, a man not to be messed with.  Dwight's Valkyrie, Rosario Dawson (Kids, Alexander) as Gail, gives a stellar (and stimulating) performance in naughty lingerie and a deadly attitude.  Benicio Del Toro (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Traffic) is excellent as Jackie Boy, a bad cop with a bad heart and a bad attitude.<br /><br />Nick Stahl (Bully, Terminator 3) is awesome.  If you liked him in Bully, you will love him in Sin City as Roark Jr, later to become the golem-like yellow freak.<br />And who can ever get enough of Rutger Hauer? (Blade Runner, Flesh and Blood, Ladyhawke, The Hitcher, etc)  Not me.  I love Rutger, and as Cardinal Roark, those deadly, cold, ice-blue eyes are soulfully used.<br />Elijah Wood (LOTR, Final Destination, The Faculty) is excellent as the psychotic, creepy Kevin; a part that you can just tell Elijah had fun with.  Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) can't act, but doesn't have to in the pretty part of Nancy.  Hats off to Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King) as Manute and Devon Aoki as Miho.<br /><br />Sin City uses voice-over narration, a third party telling of the action you watch on the screen.  This movie is as good with the sound off as it is with the sound on.  Filmed mostly in black-and-white, the photography is reminiscent of Schindler's List, though 'List' used only one small splash of color and Sin City uses a bit more, the use of color is still limited to such minute and clever spatterings that the impact is still heavily felt.<br /><br />Using over-the-top violence, impossible feats of heroism, strength, agility, and prowess (Watch for Marv's driving scene and Miho's flying archery) and some very black humor, Sin City achieves a horror aficionado's Zen-like state of almost-nirvana.<br /><br />Really, forget the plot.  It's the photography, cast, acting, FX, costumes, stylization, props, and atmosphere that, alone, bring Sin City to five stars and beyond.  Sin City is a must-buy movie.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|Roughly 3 years after the impressive, although flawed, debut album Tidal, Fiona Apple returns with a powerful, angry gem that perfects everything she failed on with Tidal. This sophomore effort is sheer perfection and one of the best records to emerge from the 90's alternative scene. Here is my track-by-track breakdown of Fiona Apple's When The Pawn: <br /> <br />1. On The Bound-The music on this song is interesting and lilting, sounding almost like something from a carnival. It contains a few musical interludes that are absolutely great, and the chorus is sung with fiery, raw passion: \\"You're all I need!\\" Fiona cries in anger and desperation. <br /> <br />2. To Your Love-Has unique instrumentation, driven by a keyboard, drums, and Fiona's vocals. This song is caustic and powerful, especially the choruses and bridge. <br /> <br />3. Limp-One of the hit singles lifted from this release, and it's fairly short (3:30) and simple, which means it can be boring occasionally. It has a verse, chorus, verse, chorus, musical interlude, and chorus. It's lack of a bridge is disappointing, but it's still an amazing song. <br /> <br />4. Love Ridden-An anemic ballad that would be better if put on Tidal. Pretty and emotional, but nothing special. It's not a skipper, though. \\"Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed,\\" Fiona croons. \\"And I want to crawl in with you/But I cry instead.\\" <br /> <br />5. Paper Bag-I LOVE this song!!! One of my favorite Fiona songs of all time! It's catchy and ingratiate, with stunning lyrics. From here on out, the album just gets better and better. <br /> <br />6. A Mistake-A good song with an interesting arrangement, catchy melody, and good lyrics. <br /> <br />7. Fast As You Can-Once again, great instrumentation, great vocals, and great lyrics.  <br /> <br />8. The Way Things Are-Another favorite. Everything about it is good. Love the piano and drums together. <br /> <br />9. Get Gone-An exceptionally pissed off song that is also one of my favorite Fiona songs of all time. The lyrics and chorus are incredible; the anger in Fiona's voice just oozes through the speakers, as if she's bleeding herself dry. <br /> <br />10. I Know-The perfect closer to the album, a beautiful ballad that is definitely superior to Love Ridden. It's so sad, and the high notes Fiona hits are beautiful.  <br /> <br />When The Pawn is a stunning, angry masterpiece that trounces Tidal in every aspect. With this album, she gets everything right.
B00005QJDG|4.0|What a concert CD! The guys hit every musical note, and there is an increased intensity. The choir and Theresa Thomason's vocals are really great. And James Labrie's vocals are not as bad as some other reviewers have said. JLB tends to go flat on really high parts, but it is not that bad here, and certainly not as bad at Once in a Livetime, where he is so horrible I can't even stand it.
B000002BE9|4.0|This album is good, but her other two are vastly superior. Tidal is moody, morose, and sophisticated, but the fact remains that a lot of it is somewhat boring. I do enjoy listening to this when I'm depressed or sad, and it always helps me out. This is a good album, it'a just that she hasn't yet realized her full potential. <br /> <br />The album begins with the heavy beat of \\"Sleep To Dream.\\" This is one of my favorites. It has an awesome melody and the lyrics are spitefully, maliciously good. Occassionally the simple arrangement kind of gets old, but the fact remains that it's one of the standouts on here. <br /> <br />Next we have \\"Sullen Girl,\\" another standout. This song is masterful and haunting, and it's about her rape, so the lyrics are very somber. \\"Is that why they call me a sullen girl...sullen girl?\\" Apple sings in a delicious voice of heartbreaking melancholy. \\"They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea/but he washed me shore and he took my pearl/and left an empty shell...of me.\\" <br /> <br />The third song, \\"Shadowboxer,\\" is amazing. It has an uptempo, driving beat, and it's catchy while still remaining mature. Its melody is something you will be itching to play, even if you're not a pianist. She's kind of melodramatic in some parts, but you'll get used to that. <br /> <br />Ah, \\"Criminal.\\" What can I say about this that hasn't been said already? Awesome song; an instant classic. One of the songs that defines the angst of the 90's generation. <br /> <br />\\"Slow Like Honey\\" is a slow, jazzy tune, and Fiona sings with a heavy, burning desire. A great song, although some of its appeal wears off after a while. <br /> <br />Track 6, \\"The First Taste,\\" begins with just one note on the piano and Fiona singing. The entire first verse is done like this, then when the chorus hits, an exotic beat kicks in, bringing with it a unique, Jamaican-esque musical background. Her voice in this is beautiful, and despite what others believe, I like the lyrics in this. They paint a pretty picture. <br /> <br />\\"Never Is A Promise\\" is, without a doubt, my favorite song on the album and one of the best songs she's ever written. The chorus is UNBELIEVABLE; she goes incredibly high and it sounds angelic. This is a gorgeous, heartfelt, poignant song that will touch you deeply, I guarantee it. I cry everytime it comes on. <br /> <br />\\"The Child Is Gone\\" is mediocre at best. Nothing special; kinda blah. <br /> <br />\\"Pale September\\" is beautiful. The verses give off an ominous tone, like something is brewing on the horizon. The chorus is lovely and romantic, serenading you. My only problem with this is that the lyrics in the verses don't match the music. <br /> <br />\\"Carrion\\" is an extremely effective closer. The verses are soft and quiet, with Fiona singing in a hushed way against an addictive bassline. The chorus has excellent lyrics and every time it is repeated, it gets louder and stronger, concluding the album with a bang. <br /> <br />Overall, it is a solid effort, although her next two are a whole lot better. Tidal is enjoyable when listened to in moderation, but it can get boring. Despite it's flaws, I recommend it highly to fans of real music.
B00006LFGD|3.0|Some are tired of the same old songs, and others have asked for remixes.  For the \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" song, I would highly recommend \\"Donna Summer VH-1 Presents Live & More\\".  The sultry Aussie, Tina Arena, sings the same part that Streisand originally sang.  However, she sings it the way the song should be sung.  Seeing her sing it on the DVD shows her put effort and emotion in to her singing.  Streisand's version of the song is rather boring, and Tina Arena brings it back to life.
B00004TH6O|5.0|First of all, what is that AWFUL review doing in the spotlight section? I'm a big Mudhoney fan, I can say that this was not done 15 years ago. Also QOTSA's sound resembles nothing of High on Fire, and maybe just a tad bit of Electric Wizard. <br /> <br />Now for the review. <br /> <br />This was Queens of the Stone Age's sophomore attempt at recording. The self-titled was an awesome rock album, and this one takes it a step further. This album feels like one giant party. It rocks out, it's fun, and it's grabbing.  <br /> <br />Queens of the Stone Age have yet to release a mediocre record, but R stands out as the best to select from.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|These kids have somehow taken everything good about danceable rock music and made me hate it. Sure, some of their songs are catchy, but the only thing seperating them from every other run of the mill \\"emo\\" band is their rhythm section. The lyrics are awful, the synth is just plain annoying, the guitars are simple punk-pop fare, and they're so obviously latching on to the dance-punk craze it's not even funny. If your favorite bands are Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, by all means, buy this album. But if you want your bands to have a little more substance than style, skip it.
B0000085N4|5.0|1989 was the year in which melodic hard rock was at its peak. Bands like Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, and Motley Crue were at or near their peak as their albums were selling millions of copies and pumping out several hit singles. Hair metal was also in full swing as bands like Poison, Warrant, Winger, and Slaughter were riding high on the charts. Another band that found its greatest success that year was a hard rock trio from the U.K. called the Cult. The band's previous releases, Love and Electric respectively, were both very strong and built the band's momentum. Sonic Temple would be the band's breakthrough release as it hit #10 on the Billboard charts and several of the tracks would receive strong airplay. Ian Astbury was one of the most charismatic singers in rock while guitarist Billy Duffy wrote some of the greatest guitar riffs since Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and AC/DC's Angus Young. While this would be the band's most successful release, listening to the album today makes you wonder how they didn't become superstars. Although several of the songs had hit single written all over them, the closest thing to a hit was \\"Fire Woman\\", which would peak at #46.<br /><br />Every track here is top notch. \\"Sun King\\" is a killer hard rocker, full of Astbury's swagger and Duffy's fiery lead work. The aforementioned \\"Fire Woman\\" would be their biggest hit single and one of the best hard rock songs of the era. How this song didn't hit the Top 10 remains a mystery. \\"Edie (Ciao Baby)\\" is a majestic ballad that is one of the band's best tracks while \\"Sweet Soul Sister\\" is a catchy melodic rocker. While both of these songs barely grazed the Billboard Top 100, the songs still sound great today and are much more memorable than most of the hair metal songs that were becoming hits. The lesser known tracks are also very good. The hard rocking \\"Medicine Train\\" and \\"Automatic Blues\\" as well as the dramatic epic \\"Soul Asylum\\" are awesome tracks and feature a strong Led Zeppelin influence. \\"Soldier Blue\\" and \\"American Horse\\" contain guitar lines that are both heavy and melodic while \\"New York City\\" recalls the raw energy and enthusiasm of the New York Dolls. The remaining track \\"Wake up Time for Freedom\\" is also very good. All told, Sonic Temple is one of the great `80s hard rock albums. Highly recommended.pelin influence. \\"Soldier Blue\\" and \\"American Horse\\" contain guitar lines that are both heavy and melodic while \\"New York City\\" recalls the raw energy and enthusiasm of the New York Dolls.

B0000047CW|3.0|Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd have managed to adapt and introduce a whole new music genre with this important and seminal album.  The title is very apt and describes not just the music on this album but also the whole subgenre that developed from this later on.  Despite this, this album remains the standard by which all other pretenders will be judged.  I believe there are other versions especially the Japanese remastered one which provides a better sound quality than this version that I recommend to get if you can still find it.  What is remarkable about the album is Charlie Byrd's great guitar work.  Naturally Stan Getz plays up a storm throughout and his solo on the first track is brilliant but I believe Byrd's playing has been overlooked.  As a guitarist myself, I'm astounded by what he does on an acoustic guitar playing at high speed and great phrasing too!  Amazing what he accomplished in relative obscurity compared to the modern day guitar \\"gods\\" whose phrasing don't come close to what this guy displays on all the tracks here.  A great album and I highly recommend you try and get a more recently remastered version if you can.
1401307450|4.0|I first read this book in parts when it was initially released, but was so distracted by the descriptions of hard core drug abuse that it was difficult to focus on the true value of what I was reading.  I passed it on to a friend after I was finished and have yet to see it again (It's making the rounds, I suppose.) <br /> <br />I purchased it again in paperback and re read it in 1 day, finding his story engrossing after it's initial shock value had worn off.  It definately helped me to understand the dark world of drug addiction so many friends have descended into and gave me some appreciation for the long road to be traveled back...something no amount of money or fame can buy you.  A candid and memorable memoir...Thank you to the authors! <br /> <br />(Also of note, Yohanna became \\"Claire\\" in the paperback edition.  I with I had my first edition back...)
B000005H3Y|2.0|No disputing that this is an excellent jazz album and is one of my personal favourites as well as an essential one to have in any music collector's library.  It needs a remastering though and so I'd recommend you go right ahead and get the remastered version.  I just managed to get a remastered version in mini-lp sleeve packaging which is simply brilliant!  The sound quality is like night and day when I played them both back to back.  As the lp sleeve version is very rare and I believe only a few are left on the Tower website where I got mine, I guess that means you'll have to get the jewel case version but that's still a lot better than this version.  Every track here though is a jazz standard; Dexter's sense of humour is what truly endears me to his playing as you'll hear him intersperse samples of other jazz standards (Panacea, Tisket a-Tasket, Take Me Out to the Ballgame among others) throughout the album.  A man in total control of his instrument and a vital influence on future sax greats like John Coltrane who readily cited him as a major influence.  A must have for any jazz lover's music library.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|If you love tenor sax player Stan Getz and pianist Oscar Peterson,you'll be nuts about this cd recorded in '57,which includes Peterson trio members,Herb Ellis on guitar and Ray Brown on bass.On their own,Peterson and Getz are just a little too mellow(for my own bad taste).Together they are incredibly well balanced-and without a drummer-Getz's conversational tone really comes through-and shows why he made bossa nova so popular.Just how well balanced this group is can be heard on their ballad medley of'Bewitched,Bothered and Bewildered which features a great solo by Getz,'I Don't Know Why,I just Do' in which guitarist takes over,'How Long Has This Been Going On'featuring  <br />Oscar, 'I Can't Get Started' with  soloing by master bassist,Ray Brown and 'Polka Dots and Moonbeams',in which Getz closes the show.According to Getz,\\"This is one of the most enjoyable recordings I ever made.How refreshing it is to play with these pros.\\"You got that right,Stan.
0525948023|5.0|I thought that there was not much else to say, after \\"The Power of Now\\", but Eckhart Tolle has surprised me once again with his new book. <br />He puts the question of \\"Being\\" and describes the mechanisms in which our ego works and sabotage our true self. <br />I strongly recommend his book, to all those is search of a better life and self understanding
0783117523|5.0|Compelling and unspeakably real, Gia is Angelina Jolie at her best.  It's a mystery to me why this movie circulates primarily within the gay community; Gia's sexual orientation is a tiny facet of the plot.  Don't see this movie if you're looking for easy-to-read characters or happy endings--or Jolie's eternal, sexy pout.  This film grapples with much deeper issues as they are experienced in real life.  Dysfunction wreaks havoc in Gia's life, from her childhood until her death, but something stronger ultimately prevails and offers both her and us a way out of the painful chaos.  Whether or not Gia chooses to take that path makes for a riveting two hours.
B00005JO17|4.0|So what if this film isn't a Pixar created picture.  It's still a cute little tale that is fun for the younger crowd to check out.  Granted, it doesn't have the emotional movements that are found in most of the older Disney flicks out there, but the Pixar films weren't that moving either.  In fact, when CGI became the focus of most film studios, plot fell to the wayside and gee-whiz effects took center stage.<br /><br />\\"Chicken Little\\" isn't for everyone.  The story is rather simple, but then again, this movie is for children.  The sky has literally fallen on Chicken Little and his father and the community of Oakey Oaks have turned their collective backs on him.  He's been turned into a laughing stock.  That is, until the sky falls on him again about a year later and aliens attempt to take over the planet.  I won't give much more information away, since it'll ruin this little film.<br /><br />There are a ton of voice talents scattered throughout this flick.  Zach Braff heads up a cast of voices that include Garry Marshall, Joan Cusack, Steve Zahn, and a number of other wonderful talents.<br /><br />The animation is pretty good.  Sure, it isn't as vibrant and snappy as Pixar's flicks, but it is sufficient enough to move this tale along.  The film runs about eighty minutes, but it moves very fast.  Also, there are a few scenes of violence that may turn off the younger crowd, though this violence is shown to be little more than a visual effect in the end.<br /><br />As for the adults, they'll get a few laughs out of this film, but not as many as the children.  Don't get me wrong, this film will be enjoyed by all, but adults can expect the humor and action to be on a lighter level.<br /><br />In short, this is a very cute little film that is perfect for the young crowd.  Just be prepared to explain a couple of the scenes to them, especially those involving the alien invasion, and the entire family will be sure to enjoy this new Disney flick sans Pixar.
B000059XUP|3.0|A sad but too often true case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Single parent Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny inadvertantly witness a murder committed by four degenerates working for Judah, the local drug lord. Unable to make a successful escape, Ashe and Danny are captured and taken to the the harbor where they are killed and thrown into the ocean.<br /><br />Meanwhile a beautiful young goth named Sarah (Mia Kirshner) is tormented by a series of bad dreams and is unable to sleep. A highly sensitive and intuitive tattoo artist and painter, she is familiar with the world of spirits and the ongoing legacy of 'The Crow.' Somehow she knows another Crow is on the way.<br /><br />And so it all begins again. A new 'Crow' rises from the watery depths of Los Angeles harbor to seek revenge against the five people responsible for the death of Danny and himself. Sarah will help guide and comfort Ashe as he defines his mission.<br /><br />'The Crow - City of Angels' certainly doesn't achieve the level of cult masterpiece as the original did, however few sequels ever do. With that understood put all your needs and desires to make comparisons aside and simply enjoy the second installment of 'The Crow Mythos.'<br /><br />Vincent Perez is quite good as the new Crow and Mia Kirshner is absolutely beautiful as the dark, ethereal Sarah. I couldn't take my eyes off her. I also enjoyed the small but memorable role played by Thuy Trang as Kali.<br /><br />Warning: While both the original and this sequel contain extreme violence, this film also is very heavy in sexual content. Be prepared for a hefty dose of nudity, S&M, voyeurism and an assortment of other behaviors unsuitable for a younger audience, or those offended by such depictions. I might have given this film -4- stars otherwise.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I saw this film back when it first came out and I wasn't just amazed with this film, I was amazed with Christian Bale. Good thing they didn't get Leonardo Dicaprio to play Bateman. As much as a good actor Dicaprio is, he doesn't fit into Bateman's shoes.  <br /> <br />This movie isn't as gory as the book, but the performances by everyone in this film makes this film a killer. Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a New York City yuppy who has money, hangs out with his friends at clubs and dinner, has a sweet girlfriend {Witherspoon}, and has a nice apt. But, there's something about him his friends don't know, he's a murderer. <br /> <br />But, things don't go too well after he kills Paul Allen {Leto}, a detective Kimble {Dafoe} is now questioning him on Allen's disappearance. <br /> <br />This uncut version doesn't have extra gore, just a longer scene of him having sex with 2 lovely ladies. This DVD does have cool features, but I wish a new interview with Christian Bale was on it. I guess he was too busy filming Batman Begins. <br /> <br />American Psycho is a must-have for all fans of the book and film fans all around.
0060512806|2.0|It was like a chore to get through this book. Work. Like grueling manual labor. I see a lot of people really liked it, which is odd because normally my taste is not that far off of mainstream likes and dislikes. I have read my share of fiction including the likes of Clancy, King and some sci-fi including hard sci-fi by the likes of Sheffield or Niven. Many of the technically oriented writers out there are bad at character development. Stephenson is one of them. He is a great writer but goes off the deep end in his digressions and details and needs a better editor to keep him on track.   <br /> <br />This was an interesting tale but incredibly flawed in the area of character development. I felt no empathy whatsoever for the characters. The love interests did nothing for me, I never \\"felt\\" anything. The only character I could understand was Goto Dengo because his background and motivations were relatively in sync. All the others were so off the wall and bizarre in their thoughts, feelings and motivations that I felt like the author was on drugs half the time. They did things totally not in keeping with who they were or should have been.  <br /> <br />The narrative is witty to the point of annoying and precious. Stephenson went off on so many tangents that I would lose track  of where the story was. There are so many complex subplots and characters that I almost started taking notes.  <br /> <br />I also just don't buy that there are so many evil but incredibly well informed business people out there, all with state of the art crypto programs and ultra-greedy paranoid intentions.  <br /> <br />If you're a computer programmer or otherwise technically fascinated by the particulars of cryptology, go for it.  Otherwise I can't recommend this.
B000002OX7|5.0|I'll tell you who they are.  The best thing to come out of London after the Rolling Stones.  Along with the Stones they basically invented hard rock.  From the day they released, \\"My Generation\\", nobody could listen to the radio for more than an hour without hearing one of their numbers.  Their early albums all built up to this masterpiece.   <br /> <br />The Who have the best composition of any band.  Roger Daltery's soaring vocals and Pete Townsend's excellent guitar playing work perfectly well with Keith Moon's lightening fast drumming.  Even John Entwistle's thunderous bass keep the band moving forward.  Pete Townsend is also a great keyboardist.  Just listen to the wonderful piano playing on, \\"The Song Is Over\\", or, \\"Getting In Tune\\", or the unforgettable organ riff on, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".   <br /> <br />The album opens with the typical Who teenage anthem, \\"Baba O'Riley\\", The keyboard riff is one of the most recognizable in rock history and its teenage wasteland lyrics would be accepted by generations for years to come.  The violin solo at the end of that song is also unforgettable.  You may have heard part of the the song, \\"Bargin\\", on a T.V. commercial but you need to here the whole thing to appreciate it.  \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\", is a classic folk-rock song and one of the most underrated songs on the album.  \\"My Wife\\", is just Daltery having silly fun with its distorted vocals and horn sections.  Things really start to get serious with the song, \\"The Song Is Over\\",  a beatiful song with an almost classical quality to it.  With its beautiful piano riffs this is another underrated gem.  \\"Getting In Tune', sorta continues, \\"The Song Is Over\\", with more classic piano playing and its beautiful melody.  \\"Going Mobile\\", is another fun tune about avoiding taxmen and police and always being on the run.  \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", is another classic folk ballad about how even the most innocent looking people can be evil underneath.  It all builds up to one of the biggest climaxes in rock history.  \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", is the ultimate rock anthem form the ultimate rock anthem group.  Beginning with another unforgettable keyboard riff and soon turning into a locomotive of pounding drums and fast paced guitar playing, the song would not be forgotten even into the new millennium. <br /> <br />This ranks right up there with Led Zeppelin's forth album and Black Sabbath's, \\"Paranoid\\" as one of the greatest hard rock albums of all time.  This album is not hard to find so buy it as soon as possible.
0679745653|4.0|A Review of the Characters in Breakfast at Tiffany's<br /><br />The novel suggests that the different characters were all searching for something that they did not possess at the beginning of the story. They were unsure of exactly what they wanted, but they knew that what they were looking for was out in the world somewhere just waiting to be discovered. It is a difficult to discuss the different elements that Capote used in his novel due to the fact that each element was suggested more than once in the different stories given in the novel, Breakfast at Tiffany's.<br /><br />Some examples of the questions are presented and then answered in two of the stories in the novel are listed proceeding. \\"The Houngan gave her this message: You must catch a wild bee, he said, and hold it in your closed hand... if the bee does not sting, then you will know you have found love.\\" The ending brings the sting of the bee back into play with the sentence, \\"...tie me in the yard just like I was when you came. That way no bee is ever going to sting me.\\" This is from the second short story presented in Capote's novel. The first story also has a good example of this concept of a search and a discovery. \\"But there were moments when she played songs that made you wonder where she learned them, where indeed she came from.\\" The answer to that question is given at the end of the short story and is given as follows, \\" ...I had found him... he was seated in the window of a warm-looking room...certain that he'd arrived somewhere he belonged. African hut or whatever, I hope holly has, too.\\"
B000002J09|5.0|First of all, the reviewer who goes by the alias MTV Supporter has no idea what good music is.  Anybody who thinks 50 Cent and Good Charlotte are better than Led Zeppelin needs to have their brain checked by a shrink immediately. Like-wise anybody who thinks that the only good music is what's played on MTV has no concept of what rock and pop are.  <br /> <br />With that out of the way, this has got to be one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time! Led Zeppelin had already established themselves as the kings of hard rock and early metal with their first three albums.  No one knew what  they were capable of untill this album came out in the early 70's.  The record is a colorful combination of hard rock, pro-metal, folk rock, chamber folk, and pure rock-n-roll.  Every song stands on its own with no support from the other songs at all.   <br /> <br />Zeppelin tries and succeeds at everything here.  The album opens with a heavy metal blues tune called, \\"Black Dog\\".  Robert Plant sings the blues like lines juxtaposed to Jimmy Page's hard rock guitar riffs.  The song ends with an amazing and progressive guitar solo; one of Page's best.  The track, \\"Rock-n-Roll is simply good old-fashion hard rock used in countless car commercials and movies.  Things change completely with the track, \\"Battle Of Evermore\\".  A mandolin driven folk number which sounds like something straight out of Lord Of The Rings or Robin Hood.  Its cryptic lyrics make you wonder what kind of religion or cult the band members were worshiping at that time.  \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", is often considered to be the best rock song of all time(it made number one on my list).  Buiding from a simple acoustic folk ballad to a epic heavy-metal anthem, the song completely rewrites the rules of songwriting and melody composition all in a space of eight minutes.  The track, \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\",  is a driving force song about the dying hippie movement at that time.  Four sticks is a drum driven song with one of Zeppelin's most identifiable guitar riffs.  The song gets its name form the fact that John Bohnam used four sticks on the drums.  The next song is, \\"Going To California\\".  Another acoustic folk ballad,  the song is about leaving an overdemanding lover for a better one in California.  The song speaks of an earthquake happening which, interestingly enough, one occured at the time the band was touring in California.  The closing number is a frightful tune about war and destruction(a subject made popular by the metal band Black Sabbath)  It's another drum driven song with eerie harmonica playing by Plant. <br /> <br />Folk, blues and heavy metal have never so happily shared album space together than on this record.  This ranks right up there with Beatle's Abbey Road and Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon as the best rock albums of all time.  Yet another record you can't go wrong with.  You don't have to be over the age of forty to enjoy music like this,(I'm only 18 and I have and enjoy almost every Led Zeppelin record ever made).  By Led Zeppelin's forth album(also called Zoso) and you will not be disappointed
B000002UA9|5.0|This is where the British Invasion began.  Modern pop music also began here.  Modern music can be divided into two eras; before the Beatles and after the Beatles.  This album was the beginning for the biggest rock group ever.  Sure alot of the tracks are covers but the Beatles do them extremely well and the original tracks are timeless.  This album may not be as good as Revolver or Abbey Road but this is the beginning and that's what makes it a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Instead of wading into the pool, the Lennon/Mccartney song writting team dove head first into the deep end.  \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", and, \\"Please Please Me\\",  have become pop standards but lesser known tracks like, \\"Misery\\", and, \\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\", are no less impressive.  \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", is one of the Beatle's hardest rocking numbers and, \\"Please Please Me\\", with its beautiful harmonies and harmonica playing is absolutely incredible.  Tracks like, \\"Misery\\", and, \\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\",  are just fun catchy tunes which are every bit as good as the other tracks.  The covers aren't that bad either.  The unforgettable dance tune, \\"Twist And Shout\\", has Lennon shouting himself hoarse by the end of the record and, \\"Boys\\", and, \\"Baby Its You\\", match the integrity of the originals.  \\"P.S. I Love You\\", is a beautiful ballad and, \\"Love Me Do\\", is simple yet effective. <br /> <br />This is where it all started so before you dismiss the Beatles as an overrated rock band with no substance to their work, take a look back and see how music was changed forever with this monumental example of musical integrity.
0307276902|5.0|Powerful...moving...emotional....honest...brutal...touching.... painfull....tearful.....honest. <br />Many have \\"Been there - Done That - Still have the scars.\\" <br />James Frey tells it.
0385720920|2.0|With all the hype surrounding \\"Fight Club\\" I made the mistake of picking up \\"Choke\\" thinking it might be a worthwhile read, or that it might keep me in touch with what was \\"happening.\\"  My curiosity was whetted when Mr. Palahniuk came to my local bookstore for a reading and book signing.  The line wrapped around the building, snaked across the street and receded as far as they eye could see.  I should have realized then what I was getting in for: a line for a punk band concert wouldn't have differed; demographically the fans were skewed toward the young, the tattooed and the heavily pierced.  Most stood listening to I-Pods and some held skateboards.  What could these cats possibly be that interested in, I thought.  So I bought. <br /> <br />What can we say about \\"Choke\\"?  On the positive side is Mr. Palahniuk's writing style.  It's clear and full of quick bursts of irreverent energy.  The chapters are short and the narration whips along at a speed agreeable to the attention span of a hamster or an average teenager.  Mr. Palahniuk is a comic writer, and the humor of this work stems from the narration of a man, Victor, who is addicted to sex.  The copious amount of prose spent on describing his lewd acts is essentially, no pun intended, the meat of the book.  He calls his member his dog, and his dog seems to be releasing its \\"little white soldiers\\" on every other page.  Now I believe writing about sex is a fine and noble pursuit, but in this instance I found it boring and redundant by page 50 or so.  Maybe that was the point - we are talking about addiction here.  But that being said, there are some engaging passages for sure - how could there not be with this subject matter. <br /> <br />Now for the book's drawbacks.  One is lack of cohesion.  Other reviews have talked about this, and it cannot be overstated.  The book does not hang together in the classical sense of a novel.  Rather it is driven by a strong narrative voice, which begins repeating itself by the fourth chapter.  A second problem is scope.  If Mr. Palahniuk just focused on a sexaholic and his struggles with that issue, maybe exploring where it came from, we would have a good frame.  Instead, the author chooses to have the narrator cover this Jesus/martyr theme, as well as insanity, as well as assisted suicide, as well as kidnapping, as well as working for a 18th century amusement park, as well as choking for a living.  This choking for a living needs particular attention.  Are we to believe that a man can make a living by choking in restaurants and have people rescue him?  Are we to believe that the people who perform the Heimlich maneuver are really going to then send him checks in the mail?  It doesn't make sense.  And even if we take it as farce, is it at all funny?  Not to this reader.  <br /> <br />In the end, the book swarms out of its own control.  There's a plot twist at the end, which at first made me smile, but upon further contemplation seems cheap and implausible - it was as if Mr. Palahniuk knew his novel was missing something, ie cohesion, and tried to distract the reader with an unearned trick at the end.   <br /> <br />So is this book worth your time?  If you want to read some titillating sex scenes, sure.  If you want an occasional laugh, maybe.  If you are looking for the next literary talent, the artist of the coming generation, look elsewhere.  I don't believe anyone will be reading Chuck Palanhuik in twenty years time.  Scratch that, in ten years time.             <br />
0446577383|1.0|This was painful to get through - something I have never said about any other DB books. Have loved everything he's written til now - hated this book! I read to escape the depressing world we are forced to live with as part of the post 9-11 world and to have to read about it by an author who I normally expect a good legal thriller from was a shock and disappointment. Found myself skimming a lot of pages b/c just wanted to be done with the book and get it back to the library - so glad I didn't spend money on this one. Not only did I have to slog through endless mideast this and islam that there were almost too many characters in this one and no development of them.  <br /> <br />If you've never read DB do NOT start with this book or you will never pick up another of his and you would miss out on so many good books - start with any of his besides this one and don't bother w/Camel - its not worth your time/money. Wish I could've given no stars here...
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down has made another masterpiece with Mezmerize, which is the fourth released cd. Mezmerize had a tough act to follow after thier last release of Steal This Album, but somehow they manages to pull off thier traditional anti-war lyrics and policital views to make the singles chart again. The CD makes the issues that we have today into entertainment, as they point fun at some of the more serious matters, such as the war in iraq. B.Y.O.B which is the number one single on this cd, is a song that pokes fun at the war in iraq, B.Y.O.B, standing for Bring Your Own Bombs, has made this cd what it is, without this one song their would be no flow to this cd. B.Y.O.B is not the only good song on this cd thier are many others that hardcore System fans would love, but if your not but you are still a metal fan, System of a Down is still the band for you. System of a Down is coming out with the sister ablum to mezmerize, called Hyptnotized. System fans are waiting for this album to be released in the next few weeks to support the best metal band of our time.
B0007GAERG|5.0|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" project truly is an emancipation for Mariah.  She not only hired completely new management, but she's also shed some of the baggage that she's held onto throughout her 15-year long career: the girly one-word definitive album title, the need to record a \\"Through the Rain\\" / \\"Hero\\" / \\"Make It Happen\\" type song, her tradition of doing one cover song per album, etc.  It also helps that Island Def Jam has undergone crucial changes that are definitely in Mariah's favour, namely the positions that L.A. Reid and Jay-Z have assumed as the heads of the record label.  This project was made possible due to the position Mariah is in now, finally free from anything and everything that had ever been tied to her career since she left Sony.  The stakes were high and amidst all the scepticism, I always had faith that this would be Mariah's moment to prove her naysayers wrong.  And I was right.  This album is headed for both critical and commercial success that far exceeds that of her previous few projects.  Here's why. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the list of all-star producers on this album, and think for a second that this will somehow lead to its assimilation into all the generic r&b music out right now (the fact that Mariah co-produces all of her music automatically prevents this from occuring, because the classic Mariah sound is always there).  The album is one of the most refreshing and uniquely crafted bodies of work I have ever heard.  The Kanye-produced track \\"Stay the Night\\", which is an expected throwback to a 70s soul classic, is a vocal masterpiece that has Mariah singing beautiful notes devoid of any melisma and vocal acrobatics.  Both the Neptunes tracks, \\"Say Something\\" and \\"To the Floor\\" are a brand new musical direction for Mariah.  They are subtle and fresh, and although completely different for her, still remain unique in the plethora of Neptunes tracks that have topped the charts in recent years.  Amazing. <br /> <br />Despite the focus on the hitmaker tracks, they aren't even the best on the album.  Mariah works with such underdog producers as The Legendary Traxster on \\"One and Only\\" (where she speed-sings alongside Twista over an ultra-chic beat) and 15-year old newcomer Young Genius, who makes \\"Joy Ride\\" one of Mariah's most passionate and sincere love ballads in recent memory.   <br /> <br />The real hero of this album in terms of production is long-time collaborator Jermaine Dupri.  Not only is he responsible for the first two singles \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\" (a stunning return to form for Mariah and undisputably one of the best songs of her career, PERIOD), but he also provided his talents for two other uptempos on the album.  \\"Shake It Off\\" is a clever and sassy freedom anthem, where Mariah sings double-time ala \\"Breakdown\\" and \\"The One.\\"  This is the projected 3rd single and is a guaranteed radio hit with its infectious bounce and lyrical sass (\\"Well at first I didn't know/But now it's clear to me/You would cheat with all your freaks and lie compulsively/so I packed up my Louis Vuitton/Jumped in my ride and took off/You'll never ever find a girl who loves you more than me.\\")  Dupri's final contribution is the 80s throwback \\"Get Your Number\\" which actually features his best imitation of Nelly on the chorus.  Although this song is catchy, well-produced and incredibly fun, JD's whiney hook is likely to distract some listeners from how sexy and playful MC sounds during the verses (\\"I got a pip penthouse with a sick hot tub/We can watch the flat screen while the bubbles fill it up.\\") <br /> <br />While it is pretty hard to choose with such an amazing album, I would say that the weakest track is the Scram Jones-produced \\"Your Girl\\" which is just over 2.5 minutes and is, in my opinion, the song that shows the least amount of lyrical and stylistic growth for Mariah.  Also, \\"I Wish You Knew\\" is beautiful and creative (ultimately, the furthest thing from a \\"weak\\" song), with itsauthentic-sounding live audience and spoken word component.  However, without this, I feel that it would likely slip through the cracks. <br /> <br />What drives this album home is the growth in Mariah's ballads, and their turn towards neo-soul as opposed to melodramatic power love songs.  The moment \\"Mine Again\\" (produced by James Poyser of The Roots) bursts through the speakers, one quickly wishes Mariah had teamed up with him sooner in her career.  The result is absolutely sublime.  A very notable contribution is also made by James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright who prodives Mariah with a raw, organic sound, using only live instrumentation as the background for the ballads.  This puts Mariah's vocals front and center and prevents the \\"over-produced\\" sound of some of her previous ballads (i.e. \\"Never Too Far\\", \\"Bringin' on the Heartbreak.\\")  The \\"Big Jim\\"-produced \\"Circles\\" is lyrically brave, simply gorgeous with some of the best vocals of Mariah's career.  The inspirational song \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" remains true to Mariah's gospel influences, and closes the album both hauntingly and hopefully, with a beautiful, positive message (\\"Somehow I know that/There's a place up above/With no more hurt and struggling/Free of all atrocoties and sufferring.\\")  Her choice to collaborate with these producers was a decision that pushed this album from great to amazing.   <br /> <br />\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" truly is an emancipation.  Although Mariah has made some great music in the past few years, this project is easily her best work since the undisputed classic, \\"Butterfly.\\"  The main factor here is GROWTH.  It is the album that showcases the most growth since \\"Glitter\\" (yes, don't believe everything you hear.  This soundtrack was a complete vocal, lyrical and stylistic maturation for Mariah and was highly acclaimed by critics before the movie flopped.  Go figure).  \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" picks up where the amazing songs from her recent projects left off (i.e. \\"All My Life\\", \\"Subtle Invitation\\", \\"Clown\\") and has managed to solidify the \\"great\\" status that her recent mediocre tracks simply failed to achieve.  The result is an album that is slightly jazzy, sometimes Hip Hop and consistently soulful.  It is thematically cohesive, as nearly all the tracks remain in the same musical vein of old school while still managing to sound beautifully contemperary.  Quite simply, this is the music I've always wanted Mariah to make.  It is the work of which she was always capable, but needed the right circumstances in order to create.  It is already one of the most critical and initial commercial successes of her career, which also makes it the long-awaited and well-deserved \\"IN YOUR FACE\\" to Tommy Motolla, Virgin Records and all the people who ever doubted the undisputed resilience and talent that IS Mariah Carey. <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had watched just two dvd's of Firefly and knew I HAD to see this movie, I looked in the theatre listings and it was NOWHERE! Then a week later it appeared at the dollar movie, I would have rather seen it at the newer bigger theatre with the better sound system. It still rocked, I am going to buy the dvd as soon as it comes out. <br />I just bought the entire series on dvd right here at Amazon, great price too! <br />Anyway, I had so many emotions watching this movie, I laughed, I cried, I was shocked, I was awed, just fantastic. <br />The few reviewers on here that said it was bad, shame on you, you must be brainwashed by George Lucas, go buy another light saber or some other toy you were brainwashed to buy. <br />I would rather have a great movie with actors I care about then all the cgi effects George can muster! <br />I can not WAIT to buy this dvd and watch it again!!!
0446310786|5.0|When I first learned I would have to read To Kill a Mockingbird in my 9th grade year, I thought I'd be the most boring book ever.  In fact, I tried to start reading it before school started, so I'd be ahead, I couldn't get past the 1st chapter.  The fist chapter is very confusing but once you past it, the book is wonderful.  In fact, after you're done reading, go back and read the first chapter again and you'll appreciate it a little more... I'm so glad they made me finish because otherwise I never would have.  It's beautifully written with hundreds of themes all woven in at the same time.  I will never again read another book like it...
6305079900|5.0|What can I say?  \\"The Terminator\\" is a classic (best of the 3, if you ask me), but the audio choices with this item are extremely limited.  Hold out for the surround sound version, if you've got the hardware fot it.
B000AA305M|1.0|DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT play this on a PC.  It will install a \\"rootkit\\" (similar to a virus) on your PC.  This is impossible to remove and a backdoor to other viruses.  This is a serious security threat to your PC function and your privacy (this software \\"phones home\\" every time you listen to the cd, reporting your IP address).<br /><br />I would recomment not buying it, if you really like this music, listen to it on the radio instead...
B0002IVN9W|2.0|Skinny Puppy, the greatest band to ever come out of Canada blows this right out of the water.  If you'd rather listen to the future of music listen to their latest album, The Greater Wrong of the Right.  Not this rehash of the Pixies and other indie college rock from the late 80's.  If you want that go listen to music from the Pixie's back catalog.  Ok, some of Arcade Fire's stuff is pretty catchy pop, gotta give it that.  Still, I think they're vastly overrated and not original enough to warrant the praise they've received.
1401206905|4.0|Only after seeing the phenomenal Batman Begins did I seek out this fabulous graphic novel.  I was absolutely floored to learn that it predates Tim Burton's take on the Bat.  Miller really delves into the psyche of the traumatized Bruce Wayne   It offers a dark, harsh picture of Gotham City and the one officer who was willing to fight the corruption present.  Anyone who reads this novel will totally forget that there was ever a '60s TV calamity called Batman.
0609610570|2.0|The authors make a compelling argument but, as I kept reading deeper into the book, I realized that what they were touting as a new management philosophy is actually established project management principles.  Linking strategic objectives to work outcomes, communicating with stakeholders, and so on - this is all covered in any halfway decent book on project management.  At least if you have a CEO who is gungho on \\"execution\\" after reading this book, then introduce them to project management and you will be the corporate hero.
B00097DXZS|5.0|I put this on over the weekend and was blown away.  Carlos Santana's guitar is on fire and the songs are great.  Collaborations with Steven Tyler, Robert Randolph, Joss Stone, Los Lonely Boys and Outkast are all very strong.  Plus the old-fashioned Santana cuts are great too.  All in all, a great return to form for Santana!
B000BBOUU4|2.0|I had hopes in going to see this film.  I have loved almost all of Tim Burton's work.  I thought that the twisted imagination of Tim Burton would really help to capture the quirky Willy Wonka.  This movie was disappointing at best.  A few of the visuals were very good (the only reason I gave it 2 stars) but the overall movie production was horrible.  What especially disappointed me was the fact that there was only one oompa-loompa.  Come on Tim, was there not enough small people who needed work?.  The sound of the oompa-loompa musical numbers I would compare to scraping nails on a chalkboard.  There is no better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder in the original 1971 version.  Avoid this movie unless you want a headache.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|The horror genre has an interesting relationship to comedy. Ever since A Nightmare on Elm Street decided to make Freddy Kreuger a stand-up comedian during his slashing sequences, the dividing line has become more and more blurred, until we reach this film, Shaun of the Dead, which is simulaneously a romantic comedy, a straight-up zombie movie and a send-up of zombie movies. It is very well done, it is very smart. <br /> <br />Because of all it brings to the table, the movie can be enjoyed by just about anyone, but fans of horror films (and zombie movies in particular) will get the most out of the references and allusions. For instance, in one of the first shots of the film, we see Shaun stumbing around his apartment, half-asleep--his walk is 100% \\"zombie-walk,\\" and you'll chuckle if you know what the \\"zombie-walk\\" looks like; when he yawns, making the \\"zombie-moan,\\" it helps to know what it sounds like. <br /> <br />But for all of the in-jokes, the movie never gets too distracted by them and instead concentrates on telling a basic boy-loses-girl/tries-to-get-girl-back story, surrounded by Satan spawn who eat human flesh. <br /> <br />The romance works, the parody works (I'd say Comic *Silver*, as opposed to Comic Gold), the horror kind of works. A worthy example of genre-bending. A fun movie to watch.
B000AOEN2C|3.0|Considering that almost every other TV show costs about $20 to $30 per season, there is no reason for this to cost over $120.  It costs 3 times that.  The producers of star trek need to realize that there are tons of fans that would buy this at a more reasonable price.  I for one would buy the full series of TNG and Enterprise.  Instead, I have bought non of them. <br /> <br />Great show, just overpriced.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|It's very safe to say that season five of GG was a startling and smashing return to form. Coming off of the misguided season four, which started off on the wrong foot but ended with a blaze of glory, season five was the kind of season that reminded you why you loved this show, and you were just glad that it was back in glorious form. There were some things that didn't quite gel as the season progressed, but they are minor quibbles. Nothing to detract from a fine season. Why so good?. The show was back to itself. Mother and daughter were more close again, and the show just had that special GG tone back. The writing was back on firmer Gilmore ground, new storylines were fresh, brilliantly done, and for this show and characters, daring. The humor was always there, but it was better and even spicier than in season four. This is the GG I knew and love. The season premiere, \\"Say Goodbye To Daisy Miller\\", was a brilliant season opener, and if you know who Daisy Miller is, the title makes perfect sense. Basically, Rory slept with married Dean, and that is causing major ripples in their lives. Dean's marriage crumbles, and Rory is in this interesting new state. Meanwhile, Lorelai and Luke are an item, and the episode \\"Written In The Stars\\", is a magical, sweet, romantic, and sweet tour de force that has the duo going on their first date. Rory meets rich kid Logan Huntberger, and it is the beginning of a new relationship. I didn't like Logan, but events towards the end of the season changed my mind a little. Other great episodes include the series' 100th episode, \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\", where Richard and Emily re-tie the knot. An amazing episode that begins a strong seperation between Lorelai and Emily. The end of the season finds Rory getting a job at one of Logans' dad's newspapers. But in \\"Blame Booze And Mellville\\", our little Rory gets disheartening news and reacts in a shocking and un-Rory way. That's what makes it great. The finale, \\"A House Is Not A Home\\", is a major piece of GG television. It sets up situations that are major in these girls' lives, and carry over into season six. It rivals season four's fantastic finale in a major way. There are plenty of other good to great episodes, but too many to all name here. Not all are great, like \\"I Jump, You Jump, Jack\\" and \\"Norman Mailer I'm Pregnant!\\", which does feature the famed author, but there isn't a bad one in the bunch. The writing is top notch and back to fighting form. This was easily one of the show's best seasons ever. The storytelling was rich, and the GG heart, humor, and drama were in full force. This season was one of the most complex and the most rejuvenated. The town of Stars Hollow itself and it's number of looney, but beloved, citizens are just as much a part of the show as anyone else, and I think they got the short shrift in season four. But they are all back and more involved than last year. Lauren Graham continues to shine and is the number one actress who continues to be Emmy-worthy, but never gets the much sought after award. Not even a nomination!. Alexis Bledel as Rory continues to blossom into such a young beauty, and this season has both women in new, different, exciting, and challenging places. Season five of Gilmore Girls is great television. The girls are definitley back.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I am very disappointed with this CD's inability to download effectively to my iPOD for my listening pleasure.  This is a political issue between Sony and Apple and nothing to do with technology.  This is a major upswelling of displeasure over this issue.  Search the internet for \\"Sony DRM Software\\" and you will get tons of articles covering this issue.  If you live with your iPOD than this is NOT the CD for you.
B000AL730O|5.0|I've been a macca fan for a long time and love his early solo work and his Wings stuff and have found many great songs that I love since then - but this CD is all wonderful with so many thoughtful and introspective songs on it that I can't seem to get them out of my mind.  At first Jenny Wren appeared as my favorite song but the deeper I got into the CD the more I realized that Vanity Fair and How Kind of You might just be my two favorites. English Tea is close though and At the Mercy and Follow Me, oh I don't know.  The CD is great, there is no mistaking, it's a masterpiece and anyone who hasn't heard Paul in a while should give this one a shot. The songs are thoughtful and melodic and very different from a lot of Paul's previous work but at the same time, very much like his early work - just different in a way I can't explain.  There is a groove here that is new for Paul and I love it - I have played the CD for friends and they are amazed that this is the Macca as there is a new and refreshing sound to it that they haven't heard.  He is longing and personal and haunting at times (Vanity Fair) and unlike some of his previous songs that may have no direct meaning (which personally I like), you can clearly find the meaning in these songs and relate them to your own life if you wish.  The darth vader Yoko can eat her words.  Go Paul, Go Veggie!!
B000AP04NI|2.0|Never give away an old DVD while waiting for a new remaster to hit the shelves! I recently gave away my old copy of \\"Oklahoma!\\", and boy do I regret it now!  <br />The first DVD of this movie came out six years ago and was unfortunately not anamorphic. It also had minor problems with shifting color intensity and some \\"flickery\\" scenes, but on the whole it looked quite decent for an early DVD-effort. So, of course I took it for granted that this new 50th Anniversary Edition would boast stellar picture quality. Not so! <br />Well, Disc One with the CinemaScope version looks grand! (This was not available on the old DVD.) But Disc Two, housing the Todd-AO version - the one also used on the 1999 release - is a mess! The colors are slightly faded and dull, and the image is extremely grainy, somewhat dark, and \\"out-of-focus\\" all the way through. This was NOT the case with the old non-anamorphic disc! Even when enlarged via zoom mode to fill my plasma screen from side to side, it looked much more sharp and distinct than the new DVD, with warmer colors and a very bright image.   <br />What happened? Surely a transfer from a 70mm source should be able to look superior to any made from a 35mm print. And what's the point of including a new little featurette where wise people sit and talk about the superiority of Todd-AO, when the rival CinemaScope-version on Disc One looks SO MUCH better? (And by the way, the two Todd-AO featurettes from 1955 and 1958, included as bonuses on Disc Two, look pretty fuzzy too! I saw the first one recently, projected from an original 70mm print on a giant screen, and while the colors had faded miserably, the focus was razor sharp! So there's really no excuse for the boring picture quality on this DVD!) <br />Dear people at Fox: your DVD's for the past four or five years have surely been among the best looking in the business! For this I thank you gratefully. (The new double-disc of \\"State Fair\\" looks absolutely terrific in every little detail! A grand job indeed!) But the new Todd-AO version of my beloved \\"Oklahoma!\\" should be recalled and remastered immediately. The 1999 DVD is proof enough that better material exist in your vaults. Whatever the problem was this time around: It can - and must - be corrected!  <br />Now...while waiting, how can I get my old DVD back without hurting my friend's feelings?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is what story telling is all about. The most enjoyable television show I have ever seen.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|True, this may be their best work since Violator - but comparisons to Violator shouldn't be the barometer by which this album is determined.  Unlike most reviewers, I think Depeche Mode's best work is Black Celebration, with Music for the Masses a close second.  Given this perspective, I find many of the tracks on this album reminiscent of that period.  And its not just the songs that bring me back to 86 and 87, but its the production - reverb, analog, dark... <br /> <br />A track for track review is unecessary here, however, I feel I need to stick up for \\"Nothing's Impossible,\\" the song many are discounting as monotone and boring.  This is one of my favorite songs quite simply because it oozes the Black Celebration era. <br /> <br />To sum up, the album's core brings us back to the glory days of Depeche Mode 85-90. <br /> <br />Just be sure to skip \\"Macro.\\" Of over 100 Depeche Mode songs, it is the only one I cannot bring myself to listen to all the way through.
B000002UQJ|5.0|Still thriving on Linda's inspiration, love and support, Paul turns out a tremendous set of tunes on \\"Off The Ground.\\"  Backing McCartney on this record are some of the best musicians around--Hamish Stuart (an old friend of Paul's), Robbie McIntosh (from The Pretenders)to name two.  As a result, it's quite a polished record.  Not slick tho. It's just solid, clean recordings of some great compositions. McCartney's pliant vocals carry the day on many of the tunes.    <br /> <br />Except for say \\"Owe it all to you\\" and \\"Looking for changes,\\" every song on the record is precious.  \\"Golden Earth Girl\\" deserves special note -- a great ballad with a hauntingly beautiful melody.  If he'd written it as a Beatle, it would be a Beatles greatest hit. The two songs cowritten with Elvis Costello--Mistress and Maid, Lovers that Never Were--are awesome, and showcase McCartney's redoubtable pipes.  \\"Biker Like An Icon\\" is spooky, with great guitar work and an otherwise fantastic backing track.  I saw him play this one at Folsom Field in Bouler, CO and if there had been a roof, he'd have blown it off.  \\"Get out of my way\\" is simple rock n' roll, with a catchy chorus, and an impresssive horn section track.  Macca sings the hell out of this one.  I used to skip over \\"Peace in the Neighborhood\\" but now I like it.  I will say, however, it's a little too happy and sappy.  \\"Owe it all to you\\" suffers from the same defect.
B00004VVND|5.0|This film is a real kick! I liked very much it when I first saw it in the '70's right after it came out, and still enjoy watching it. Anyone who likes this genre should enjoy it as well.<br /><br />Yul Brenner- one of my all time favorite actors- in his role as the psycho, hyper focused, relentless robot villain performs flawlessly; in fact, all performances in the film are very high quality. In addition, in my opinion, the story is quite unique, and is weirdly compelling- just so off the wall! Also, for the era in which it was made, the special effects are quite good. It's not a story that one need take seriously- it's just pure sci-fi entertainment. My two teenage daughters- who are somewhat jaded as far as movie effects go- just loved the film.<br /><br />I DO have a question for anyone who cares to post a response in their review of this film: There was a sequel made to Westworld called- &lt;u>\\"Futureworld\\"&lt;/u>. As I recall, it was just as much fun as its predecessor. Along with Yul Brenner back as the 'evil' robot guy, it also stars Peter Fonda. I have been trying to find it for sale with no success, and am wondering if anyone out there might know whether it has been released for sale on DVD yet?  Thanks!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I realized that Joss Whedon had something here when I first saw \\"Firefly\\" in 2002. Unfortunately, I'm not a FOX exec. I was ecstatic to get the DVD set of \\"Firefly\\" and just as pleased that \\"Serenity\\" made to the big screen.  <br /> <br />I rated this film as five stars - if I could I'd rate more. \\"Serenity\\" satisfied every expectation I had for the film and more. The movie is both faithful to the fans and to a new audience. Action, dialogue, character development were superb. WOW! I wouldn't be suprise that Joss Whedon gets nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay. The cast was very good. I really cared about the characters. Can't wait for a sequel or better a new series. <br /> <br />BUY THIS VIDEO!!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Playing the Angel is without a doubt a melancholic masterpiece  that fully compliments DM's previous works. It's not that this album is better or worst than the previous ones but that the substance of their overall themes and style fit incredibly well with their previous evolving efforts. Playing the Angel- as in all of Depeche Mode's music is not intended to be the hyped- mainstream,commercial music that is out there but instead the group has kept their integrity and uniqueness in adhering to their dark, gloomy and intricately developed compositions. Indeed,their music grows on us for two main reasons: 1) Their grim & stark music helps us to connect with a part of our human psyche & soul that many groups fail to capture. 2) Their psychedelic beats are an addictive pulsating cure and a hypnotic source of therapy. In Playing the Angel, the band continues to transport us with they synth/pop alternative sounds into futuristic places, into our own morbidity and dark emotions and into a ray of hope amidst our struggles and seemingly dark existence. The thematic aspects remain consistent in PTA. The religious overtones, the biblical concepts, the continous questioning of God's work continue being the recurrent themes.  While 'Lilian' (my personal favorite) and 'Precious' address relationships, in upbeat 'John the Revelator' and Gahan's 'Sinner in me' the feelings of guilt and angst remain. The recurrent theme of Pain and Suffering are also evidently revisited in the songs 'A Pain that I'm used to'and 'Suffer Well' An additional theme is discovered in Martin Gore's 'Macrovision' detailing the performance of our bodies as a precise machinery. If at first it makes you quizzy, relax; you'll discover it's a great addition to their work.  Overall this is an excellent album that will continue to impact throughout generations. Like fine wine, Depeche Mode is an acquired taste for intelligent listeners worldwide.  (South Florida, USA)
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Symptoms: Long periods of silently staring at a lyric sheet.  Sudden insensitivity to high volume.  Ennui for lost childhood, and long minutes of ponderous silence.

If it's even a fraction as good as \\"A Million Little Pieces\\", then it's money well spent. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  Thanks James!!!
B00005JO1G|3.0|Although this movie has gotten a lot of good reviews.  I find that it is bland and unmoving.  However, I am not a soldier or a veterian.  Military framilies will be able to apricate this movie a lot more than the general public.  But I find that it was still intreging enought to be an enjoyable movie.
0804106304|4.0|At first the unclear wisdom and unspoken rules between the characters in the \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" was a little frustrating. But then I saw how this ambiguous wisdom reflects the ambiguity of the complex mother/daughter relationships in the book. It's an accurate portrayal of the depths of difficulty and joy found in the unavoidable link between mother and daughter. In the book, life's hardships and joys are explored through the lens of old China and modern China, and through new Chinese immigrants as well as assimilated Chinese-Americans. Through the eyes of the members and daughters of the Joy Luck Club, we see that one can try desperately to explain the past/present/future with a proverb or a riddle, but ultimately learning to have joy in the middle of whatever luck one gets is the key. One quote in the book sums it up, \\"Then you must teach my daughter this same lesson. How to lose your innocence but not your hope. How to laugh forever\\". No matter how young or old, or which culture you are from, there are lessons to be learned from the ageless mothers and daughters of \\"The Joy Luck Club\\".

B000B2YQX4|5.0|I'm a Depeche Mode fan from way back and I love this new disc in a way I haven't loved any of their work since the Black Celebration- Music for the Masses era. This is dark, melodic music that holds up to repeated listening, and every song on the disc is memorable, unlike some more recent releases. I like Violator, Ultra, Exciter, et. al., but none of these albums have grabbed me in quite the same way. Playing the Angel has been in constant play in my car and home CD player since the day it was released and I'm excited about the band all over again, the way I was when I saw them in concert during the Masses tour. It's great to see they've still got what it takes to turn out great music, unlike some of their contemporaries (New Order, the Cure) who are still with us. Let's hope that continues to be the case. Long live Depeche Mode! Viva Depeche Mode!
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|From the very first searing lick on the very first track, I knew that this album was going to be a big treat.  Buddy's in top form on guitar and vocals.  He's sizzling, tough, happy or soulful whenever needed.  On guitar, he posseses the versatility, dexterity and control to put much younger guitar superstars to shame.  His induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is well deserved.  What's consistent about Buddy Guy is that he is always spontaneous, tries new things and keeps things fresh, all very effectively. Of the 13 tracks, only 5 have partial guest star collaborations that don't detract from the rest of the album which remains pure Buddy Guy.  Unlike his last two albums, which were heavy on blues tracks, this new album also has blues-infused rock, R&B, soul and pop as well as a couple of great pure blues songs. If you like rock start with tracks 5 and 11 for example (I also have Carlos Santana's new album, and almost all tracks on that are outshone by Santana's co-playing with Buddy on \\"I Put A Spell On You.\\").  If you like blues, start with tracks 4 and 10. If you like soul, start with tracks 1 and 13, and so on. While old-school blues purists may balk at such variety, it appears Buddy is teaching us how the blues is part of popular music and how the blues can enhance popular music.  Finally, Buddy's performances on David Dye's World Cafe program mentioned by an earlier reviewer, on NPR radio or website, were spectacular.  It does show his creativity -- he never plays the same song the same way on different days on his shows.  Buddy Guy remains a legend among legends.  You'll love this album.
0307276902|2.0|I am glad to see that I am not the only one who thought this book was a waste of time.  Hardly a literary masterpiece but rather a self aggrandizing, repetitive and grammatically challenged Oprah prodigy.  Quit the bad boy crap James, you are a spoiled rich kid who humiliates those who truly are victims.
B00006AG5N|4.0|I love his music! I love the songs like heartbreak hotel or Kentucky Rain. Elvis Presley made music history and he is why we have rock today. It's evolved over the years, but he was the king.Teens,children, adults, can all enjoy his music.I actually don't like his whole Viva Las Vegas gig in his later years, but I love his music when he was just starting. The jumpsuits didn't do anything for me. This CD is perfect if you are an over all elvis fan,or if you don't really like his Jumpsuit years (like me) because a lot of his earlier hits are on this CD! Everyone should own this CD. It's his #1 hits, come on. What more can I say???

I Saw them live and thought they were really good, so i decided to buy there album, i havent been able to stop listening to it, every time you listen you hear some new sound that if focused on makes the whole song different i recomend this album to any one that is looking for some new bands to really get into.

068987474X|5.0|\\"Deal with reality! He's just not that into you!\\" the authors of this book insist.  Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, who worked together writing for HBO's \\"Sex and the City\\", have provided us with an easy, fast-paced book, filled with humorous anecdotes, smart-aleck comments, and unscientific polls.  It is a lot of fun.  If it weren't, no one would read it, the message being too blunt for our wishful thinking and fragile fancies.  This book is a MUST READ for women of all ages who are dating, rethinking a relationship, involved in a frustrating relationship, or planning to enter a relationship.  I recommend it to dating women with a sense of urgency.  You're already logged into Amazon.com, or you wouldn't be reading this review.  So, be nice to yourself and buy it right now.  I can't stress it enough:  A MUST READ!
B0009A40ES|5.0|Directed by Mary Harron and based on Bret Easton Ellis' novel, American Psycho is an excellent cinematic approach to various issues that have sparked constant controversy.  While not as graphic as the novel these controversial topics still shine through.  Racism, misogyny, gratuitous sexuality and violence are just a few of the obstacles a viewer will meet headfirst when seeing this movie. <br /> From Patrick Bateman's first soliloquy to his last, you get the sense that you're not watching your typical serial killer movie.  American Psycho places you right into the mind and daily routines of its villain.   What makes the above issues even worse per se, is that the main character has no feelings about what he does.  He commits the most horrendous acts with as much ease or emotion as one might use when brushing their teeth.   <br /> The role of Bateman is played by Christian Bale.  He fully grasps and embraces his character turning it into a precise art.  He makes the movie worth watching solely on his performance.  He gives the role a dark but goofy edge, which may even cause you to laugh at some of his more vicious acts.   <br /> An interesting factor about Patrick Bateman is the fact that you would never suspect him of being a serial killer.  He's a millionaire, he has a perfect body, and he can get any girl he wants.  He seemingly has the perfect life one might think.  No one would ever guess what really goes through his mind. <br /> One of the best things this movie does as a whole is the fact that it turns a very controversial book into a very satisfying and enjoyable film.   <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Most evening television shows are becomingly increasingly sexual, violent, and mature. Everwood is one that almost any age can appreciate. <br />  <br /> Everwood, now into its fourth season, is about a famous neurosurgeon that moves from New York City to Everwood, Colorado, along with his son and daughter, after his wife dies. The series is a heart-warming story of this family and their adjustment and life in a new place. The actors are well-chosen, and bring the audience to form an attachment to them. The series does have a certain level of maturity, introducing topics such as death, illnesses, teen pregnancy, and drinking abuse. These issues are not glamorized unlike the way presented in most media today. They are dealt with as problems and situations that need to be assessed and solved. This series is mostly about developing relationships with family and friends and overcoming obstacles. <br /> <br /> Starting in the early evening, television is crammed full with shows about sex, deceitfulness, and drugs. Each show you watch seems to overcome you with things that although interesting, illustrate bad situations as usual events in life, such as infidelity, and betrayal. Also, with all the new reality television series, \\"real\\" life seems like it should be all about partying, as in MTV's Real World, or competition, as in America's Next Top Model. Most shows today do not have a whole lot of decency in them. <br /> <br /> Everwood is an excellent family show and fun for everyone. The series is filled with drama, comedy, and romance that anyone can enjoy.
0060736267|5.0|Readers who come to \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" looking for a fast-paced or action-packed storyline should look elsewhere:  Betty Smith's perennial coming-of-age novel is more like a stroll through the forgotten alleyways and tenements of Brooklyn at the turn of the century.   <br /> <br />Influenced by Smith's work with the WPA during the Great Depression, the story ties issues of social injustice, gender, and class to a narrative of the childhood and youth of Francie Nolan, a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn.  The novel is rich with vivid descriptions of tenement life, from clothing to food to the variety of ethnicities crammed together in busy Brooklyn.   <br /> <br />What's wonderful about this book is that it is accessible to all age ranges due to a cast of unique characters and has as much for the teen reader as the older reader who seeks a historical overview of the very specific period.  Offering intense emotions, unforgettable characters and a broad appeal, \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is an often-overlooked masterpiece of American literature of the last century.
B000A78Z82|4.0|I was first introduced to Devendra on a terrific show found on the NPR website called \\"All Songs Considered,\\" and I rushed out and bought \\"Rejoicing.\\"  Recently, a neopsychedelic show called the Kaleidoscope Cafe on the website Radio Free Phoenix featured  the track \\"Heard Somebody Say,\\" and it gave me the chills.  It is the best of the handful of Iraq War songs and deserves to be alongside the great protest songs of John Lennon.  I purchased the album based on that song alone and I was not disappointed.  It doesn't have the gritty street performer sound of his previous releases, which is a good thing.  You will hear tremendous growth and a great sense of things to come from this amazing artist.
8186336141|5.0|There are innumerable books on yoga to be found; some emphasising the practical aspects with postures (asana), complete with colour photos - and some impossibly esoteric, meant for the select few with mystical leanings. This book combines a comprehensive overview of asana; while at the same time giving clear explanations of the deeper aspects of yoga, including breathing (pranayama), body attitudes (mudra), energy locks (bandha), energy centres (cakra), and yogic cleansing (hatha yoga).<br /><br />The roots of yoga are in the ancient vedic and tantric texts; many of which have remained inaccessible to western readers until the last century. Much of the teachings were kept secret; firstly, because they had been banned by a Hindu priesthood that felt threatened by anarchic schools of self-liberation; and secondly, for fear that the powerful techniques could be misused by misguided opportunists.<br /><br />Swami Satyananda Saraswati was one of the renegades who shocked the yogic establishment by not only translating the texts and teaching the techniques to western students; but then went on to publish an entire series of books, clarifying and promoting yoga in an unprecedented way.<br /><br />Satyananda's other significant move was to bring yoga into the domain of medical science, and explain esoteric techniques in terms of western anatomy and physiology. He started the Bihar Yoga Bharati, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate studies in subjects like Yoga Psychology and Applied Yoga Science; and initiated the Yoga Research Foundation which studies the medical effects of yoga.<br /><br />Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha (APMB) is a required text for any serious yoga aspirant. It not only clears away the mysticism around yoga left behind by the early Theosophists, and revived by the New-Ageists; but gives a sound theoretical foundation enabling one to understand the underlying purpose and efficient practice of yoga techniques.<br /><br />The clarity of the illustrations and the wealth of information will ensure many years of delving into this classic reference work.illustrations and the wealth of information will ensure many years of delving into this classic reference work.
B00003CX95|1.0|I finally got round to watching this film about a month ago.  What a mistake!  I don't know what the English have done to Mel Gibson but it must have been pretty awful for us to merit this racist nonsense. <br /> <br />Just in case you missed them here are some of the 'inaccuracies' (aka lies) in Gibson's 'triumph': <br /> <br />Firstly, William Wallace did not get Queen Isabella pregnant.  They never even met.  Wallace died in 1305 when Isabella was about 13.  Isabella's son wasn't born until 1312; 7 years after Wallace's death. <br /> <br />Secondly, Wallace himself was not a peaceful farmer driven to rebellion by the murder of his wife; he was a minor nobleman who had been carrying out a guerrilla-style war with the English for years before the events apparently shown in the film. <br /> <br />Thirdly, the film shows Irish conscripts switching sides and joining Wallace's forces at the Battle of Falkirk in one big example of Celtic brotherhood. In fact the Irish forces were mercenaries who fought pretty well for Edward I. <br /> <br />Fourthly, kilts weren't worn until about the 16th Century (not the 13th as in Braveheart <br /> <br />There's more but I really can't be bothered to type it.  I'm off to torture some babies, put kittens in a blender and set fire to a church full of innocent Americans (just like in the equally awful 'The Patriot').   <br /> <br />Why? Why not; I am English after all! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|..rock hard one more time. In which we find our heroes, after going through periods of electronica, r & b, self-flaggelation and photo ops with world leaders, rising up in their late 40's and for no reason at all except to show they can do it - rocking their asses off.  <br /> <br />These guys are the biggest rock band in the world, and expectations are always way too high. You can't be 20 years old for your whole life, and of course they stumble, but even their misses are interesting.  <br /> <br />All these whiners on here will be screaming their asses off when they see them live. *L* <br /> <br />One more time! <br /> <br />
B000002I69|5.0|The Dave Brubeck Quartet did several *gooood* live recordings.  What makes this one stand out is the addition of Gerry Mulligan. <br /> <br />Mulligan and Paul Desmond worked great together - they did another album, \\"Two of a Mind\\", where the interplay was almost telepathic - and this CD is no exception. <br /> <br />As with some other reviewers, I too would have preferred to see the \\"Time Out\\" personnel, drummer Joe Morrello and bassist Gene Wright, on this CD too, but Alan Dawson and Jack Six fill in nicely.  (And this recording was twelve years later...)   In fact, the 16:00 version of Take Five on this CD has the time for a longer drum solo than on the original \\"Time Out\\" version, not bad at all IMHO. <br /> <br />As for the tracks: \\"Truth\\" starts out with a vaguely foreboding motif by Brubeck, very effective, reminding me in concept of a piece like the first movement of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2.  Alternatively, among well-known jazz CDs, the intro to \\"Autumn Leaves\\" on Cannonball Adderley's \\"Somethin' Else\\" CD introduces the same mood, although the Brubeck piece turns uptempo much more rapidly.  The interplay between Desmond and Mulligan is pretty good on this piece.  The improv by Brubeck later seems to recall, what, Edgar Varese? the Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari soundtrack?  - but it leads into a nice, if schizophrenic duo with Jack Six. <br /> <br />\\"Unfinished Woman\\", a distantly haunting melody by Mulligan, sets up a fine duo between Gerry and Dave...then a contrasting repeat with Paul Desmond and Dave.  There is one annoying sub-second dropout about the 5:00 mark during this - don't know if it's just my recording. <br /> <br />\\"Koto Song\\" is a placid mood piece - with overtones of the Japanese instrument from which it draws its name.  No Mulligan on this piece, which is perfect for Desmond anyway. <br /> <br />What can I add about a sixteen-minute version of \\"Take Five\\"?  I do wonder what Joe Morrello would have done with the drum solo, which was Brubeck's original reason for writing this song. <br /> <br />\\"Rotterdam Blues\\" is more blues-tinged than anything else, but again showcases Jack Six effectively... <br /> <br />...and \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" is a nice, short, goodbye solo. <br /> <br />The recording, absent one dropout, is good, and the liner notes from the original album are a nice plus. <br /> <br />The only negative I can possibly imagine is that this is *live* jazz.  I personally don't think that's a negative, but tastes vary. <br /> <br />So...Dave Brubeck, Paul Desmond, and Gerry Mulligan playing live...what's not to like?  Five stars.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is truly the best album ever written.  You may be hooked in originally by Where the Streets Have No Name, or With or Without you.  But you will soon discover gems such as Mothers of the Disappeared and One Tree Hill.  Rolling Stone recently named it the 26th greatest album of all time, and though U2 has come out with many more, they will never be able to outdo the brilliantness of the Joshua Tree.
B000001EXR|4.0|While KISS certainly proved to be innovators and trendsetters with their classic early albums and shows, they have also proved to be trend followers as well. Since the late 70s, KISS has jumped on whatever bandwagon was the flavor of the month in order to stay relevant. In the late 70s it was disco-pop with \\"Dynasty\\" (1979) and \\"Unmasked\\" (1980). In the late 80s it was glossy pop-metal, with \\"Crazy Nights\\" (1987). So, what kind of album do you think KISS would make in the mid-90s? Yup, you guessed it, a grunge album.<br /><br />Released in 1997, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" had been recorded two years earlier. The lineup for the CD includes Paul Stanley, (vocals, rhythm guitar) Gene Simmons, (vocals, bass) Bruce Kullick, (vocals, lead guitar) and Eric Singer (drums). \\"Carnival of Souls\\" had been intended for a 1995 release, with an accompanying tour to promote it. But those plans were cancelled when original KISS members Ace Frehley (guitar) and Peter Criss (drums) rejoined the band for their massively successful 1996 reunion tour. Kullick and Singer were dismissed from the band and \\"Carnival of Souls\\" was put in the can. Throughout KISS's reunion tour, bootleg copies of \\"Carnival of Souls\\" started to appear in various forms and quality. Sensing enough interest for an official release, \\"Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions\\" was released in 1997.<br /><br />KISS's longevity can be attributed to the fact that they have proved to be good musical chameleons over the years. Even if KISS does shamelessly follow musical trends, they can still, overall, do so with considerable success. If KISS can incorporate disco-pop into their sound with \\"I was made for lovin' you\\" and make it sound like KISS, then KISS can certainly make a grunge sounding album in a KISS mold as well.<br /><br />\\"Carnival\\" is a grunge sounding album, but with a metallic edge. Many reviewers/fans/critics have correctly stated that the album sounds like \\"Badmoterfinger\\" (1991) era Soundgarden. The album overall is quite dark, and not of the celebratory nature of most KISS albums. \\"Carnival,\\" also demonstrates the dark, cheerlessness of KISS's \\"Music from the Elder\\" (1981). But whereas \\"Elder\\" was a progressive concept album, \\"Carnival\\" is a more stripped-down, straight-forward affair. Indeed, \\"Carnival\\" shows the band going for a minimalist approach. The whole album sounds sparse and stripped-down. All-in-all, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" can therefore be seen as \\"Badmoterfinger\\" meets \\"Music from the Elder\\" meets \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" (1970).<br /><br />The title of the album \\"Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions,\\" may lead one to conclude that it is a CD of demos from those '94-'95 sessions. Not so. The CD is a finished product and could have received an official release as is back in '95.<br /><br />Stanley and Simmons each sing about half the album, with Bruce Kullick giving his first (and only) lead vocal performance with the closing \\"I walk alone.\\" Stanley, Simmons, and Kullick co-wrote the album with Curt Cuomo, Scott Van Zenn, Jamie St. James, Ken Tamplin, and future KISS guitarist Tommy Thayer.<br /><br />The opening sluggish \\"Hate,\\" and the gloomy \\"Rain\\" sound like \\"Badmotorfinger's \\"Rusty Cage,\\" and \\"Outshined\\" respectively. \\"Master and Slave\\" has the band stripped down to its bare-bones. Simmon's hammering bass over Stanley's eerie delivery before its melodic chorus is quite cool. \\"Childhood's End\\" is one of the album's strongest tracks. Simmon's cocky, defiant delivery, with its melodic, sing-along chorus, ultimately makes it a triumph. The album's shinning moment is the stunning semi-acoustic \\"I will be there.\\" A tribute to a father-son bond, this is one of the finest songs that KISS has ever penned. It is somewhat reminiscent of \\"friends\\" and \\"Since I've been loving you\\" from \\"Led Zeppelin III\\". The melodic hard-hitting, \\"Jungle\\" is effective and keeps up the momentum.  \\"In my Head,\\" and \\"It never goes away\\" comes straight out of the \\"Badmoterfinger\\" playbook. While notbad, they're rather sluggish and never really get off the ground, putting a wrench in the albums momentum. The melodic mid-east flavored \\"Seduction of the innocent\\" gets the album back on track. \\"I Confess\\" is both menacing an aggressive. Stanley and Simmon's duet in the chorus works very nicely. \\"In the Mirror\\" has a cool Zeppelin-meets-Soundgarden like quality. The Bruce Kullick song \\"I Walk Alone\\" closes out the album. A celebration of the loner, this is one of the album's most memorable songs. It's a shame that Kullick was never afforded the opportunity to sing it live with KISS.<br /><br />While \\"Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions\\" will ultimately be just a footnote on KISS's legacy, it's still a memorable album. While it doesn't rank up there with such classics as \\"KISS,\\" (1974) \\"Destroyer,\\" (1976) and \\"Love Gun,\\" (1977) it's still an excellent album that fans of the band should check out.oterfinger\\" playbook.

B00097DXZS|1.0|I have been trying to remove the rootkit and DRM software that this CD installed on my PC without success. I can't comprehend why Sony would produce a CD that I can't play on my PC without installing extra software of a very dubious nature. This is a dangerous precendent Sony is setting. What is to prevent other record companys from wanting to install their own software, and what guarantees do I have that it won't walk on Sony's device controllers, or slow my PC to a crawl running all this crap? I'll play this CD on the CD player, but not on my PC, and from my perspective, the value drops immensley without the PC functionality.
0099448599|3.0|My first thought when setting out to write this review was, 'Hmmm, I wonder how many irrelevant and obscure titles I can work into the review, that may or may not shed some light on the subject matter at hand?'<br /><br />I am a fairly well-read person (I am told I am too modest, and that I qualify as a very well read person, but I don't want to claim too much, lest some diabolic force leap forward to claim me back for my sin of pride, a particularly bad thing for those of holy orders, as every guide and advice to the priestly states since the days of Irenaeus). But I digress.<br /><br />But this is in keeping with the flavour of the novel. Unless you like digression, stay far away (run, don't walk!) from this novel. But, if you go in for the seemingly endless, barely understandable and eventually irrelevant, then by all means, this is the book for you.<br /><br />I would not have read this book but for the urgings of friends who were similarly reading this, and wanted to compare notes. Thanks, guys!<br /><br />Now, I must hasten to add at this point, I did find myself enjoying the book several times. I don't mind the digressions, but I found the attempts (subtle but there) to equate Corso with a Holmesian character unconvincing (and the attempts were subtle enough that Perez-Reverte could claim they aren't actually there). Apart from Holmes, he ignores most of English literature--when he talks of those who wrote in serial form, i.e, Stendahl et alia, he neglects those such as Dickens.<br /><br />I would love to have the card catalogue Perez-Reverte was sitting next to as he wrote this; perhaps he used Amazon.com and other internet searching to add that final irrelevant entry in each of the listings of books.<br /><br />I am a bibliophile. I sit in a room, such as Perez-Reverte describes in several places, where shelves sag on walls groaning from the strain of heavy books, heavy in content as well as mass weight. I have several such rooms in my home. But I couldn't quite find the same love of books in this book, where sometimes bibliophilia was a fetish, and other times a useless detail.<br /><br />Basic plot--is it a murder or is it a suicide? What does the manuscript have to do with it? Dumas (who wrote, among other things, the stories involving the Musketeers) is seemingly at the centre of things, along with a possibly-phoney book of occult forbidden knowledge, for which men will die (obviously) or kill. There is diabolic force at work, maybe. Corso is the rare-books expert called in to investigate the case, who doesn't always like the role of policeman.<br /><br />Perez-Reverte seems intent on impressing us with his erudition in the field of literature and continental travel. It would be impressive if it were consistent and organised along better lines, and woven into a story where such details made a contribution. This book, as a mystery, fails to deliver because it both gives more information than is necessary (which can be an effective device, forcing the reader to separate 'the wheat from the chaff', or figure out which strands to follow; sadly, that is not the case here) and insufficient information in the strands which count to allow the reader to 'figure it out' (another sin, often difficult to avoid when one is trying for a 'complex' novel; even Conan Doyle frequently failed on this point).<br /><br />In all, this is an inventive idea, with interesting character formation; for some reason, neither the story nor the characters get developed sufficiently (either in size or direction) to make this a first-class novel.<br /><br />The New York Daily News described this book as 'A cross between Umberto Eco and Anne Rice' (Eco is very prominent here, as Perez-Reverte is obviously trying to emulate and cash in on Eco's prominence in the richer-and-book-purchasing English-speaking world). The New Yorker gets even more, well, New-Yorker-ish: 'A noir metafiction [please someone, tell me just what that means, in English??] Even a reader armed with a Latin dictionary and a copy of The Three Musketeers cannot anticipate the thrilling twists of this stylish, Escher-like mystery.'<br /><br />Perhaps one of the reasons one cannot anticipate 'the thrilling twists' is the inconsistency in the novel? Just a thought.<br /><br />Escher-like...well, yes, you read one thing and it turns out to be another (for instance, I thought I was reading a great novel, and it turned out to be...)<br /><br />No, that is unfair.

B00007KMP1|5.0|I remember the first day I had heard this album. And at first, I didn't even know I was listening to Beck, let alone a new album. I had gotten to work after my chef had arrived. It was a really small kitchen so chef and I were working right next to each other. After I had started my prep list, I began to take notice to what was on the stereo. After maybe the third song, I asked my Chef, \\"what is this?\\" He said it was Beck's new cd called \\"Sea Change.\\" At first it sounded nothing like Beck to me. But I had kind of fallen off the Beck \\"wagon.\\" I remember going to see him live on NCSU Campus, when Atari Teenage Riot opened for him. This was just after \\"Odelay\\" came out. I was in middle school around the time \\"Mellow Gold\\" was released. Anyways, Sea change was such a departure from those albums, so I decided to investigate his other releases, like \\"Midnite Vultures\\", and \\"Mutations\\"(which is my favorite beck album). After listening to thos albums I began to see where he was going. This album, Is musical genius in my opinion, or at least this a beautifully produced album by a musical genius. It just shows that Beck can do just about anything with any style of music he wants, and it just works.... wonderfully. I think this is one of those albums that I will never tire of. I would have paid three times what I paid for it and still feel like it was money well spent. If you haven't bought it yet and are a Beck fan, do yourself a favor.

The style of his other three books is there (Deception Point, Angels and Demons and DaVinci Code) and the storyline is interesting but it's a little too 'sci-fi', unrealistic and at times silly for me.

First off, the production is SOLID! John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy (guitarist and drummer, respectively) did a great job of producing it in the studio. The drums sound great, and the instruments sound better! On top of that, if that wasn't enough and it would make any DT fan drool, James sounds GREAT! Sure, he KINDA sounds nasal, but it's because he sometimes sings too close to the mic'. I'd say this is the best production on ANY DT release.<br /><br />Second, the performance is AMAZING! Here's a quick rundown through the tracks:<br /><br />As I Am: Great, energetic live starter. The solo is MINDBLOWING.<br /><br />This Dying Soul: Great enough follow up. Love Jordan's keyboard adlibs here.<br /><br />Beyond This Life: The extended jam session gave me a massive erection.<br /><br />Hollow Years: I love JP's added Spanish guitar solo at the intro.<br /><br />War Inside My Head/The Test That Stumped Them All: Now it gets back to HEAVY! The transition between these 2 songs is amazing!<br /><br />Endless Sacrifice: Great, just like the studio version, though.<br /><br />Instrumedley: A mix of all the band's instrumentals! AMAZING!<br /><br />Trial of Tears: Amazing. James never sounded better.<br /><br />New Millennium: Great but I don't get why the crowd roared with excitement during the intro.<br /><br />Keyboard solo: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, MR. Jordan Rudess!\\" Exellent keyboard solo!<br /><br />Only a Matter of Time: Along with TOT, James' best performance here.<br /><br />Goodnight Kiss/Solitary Shell: Exellent, yet again, one of James's bets peroformances.<br /><br />Stream of Consciousness: Great instrumental!<br /><br />Disappear: Better than the \\"Six...\\" version!<br /><br />Pull Me Under: Do I need to say anything here?<br /><br />In the Name of God: And now the grand finale! IT was absolutely amazing! The added solo at the end was brilliant! I did the hand swinging along with the crowd ;).<br /><br />On to disc 2:<br /><br />It gives a documentary of the band's tour. IT's great to watc, and has a hilarious moment: When LaBrie was getting his voice in shape, John P. and Jordan tried to sing to! \\"Did I mention... YEAH!\\"<br /><br />There is also the intro tape, which is what they played at the start of each show on tour.<br /><br />There are John P. and Jordan's setups, which ARE indeed interesting.<br /><br />There's Mike's killer drum solo.<br /><br />And there's a multi-angle lense of \\"Instrumedley\\".<br /><br />All in all, it is a must for ALL DT fans.along with the crowd ;). <br /> <br />On to disc 2: <br />It gives a documentary of the band's tour.

B0000DYKET|5.0|This is one of the most comfortable shoes or sandal I have ever owned. I first saw these on some ultralight backpackers I met in 2005, and they swore by them for comfort and strong enough to climb rough terrain. For a sandal, that just blew me away. I confess I have not used them to backpack, but I have used them on rough terrain and they are outstanding and amazingly \\"grippy\\". It has little nubs on the carbon outer sole that dig into or grip everything.<br />SIZING:  I have read that most people find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoes, and that was my experience as well.<br />COMFORT: Tremendous arch support. The sandal has a wide toebox so that your toes are not cramped together, and the protective toe guard is great. I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these, plus I can hide my ugly toes. It also has a little rise on the rear heel that cups your heel comfortably, but helps protect you against those people that step on the back of your foot in line. The sandal feels very secure once it is on and does not slip. There are no straps to fool with or Velcro to adjust, it has an inner lining that looks like the neoprene on a scuba suit, it stretches to fit. The rear strap does not hurt your foot. It has a no lace closure and you set it once, from then on it slips on easy. The footbed cradles my foot like no shoe I have ever seen. There is a little ridge on the inner sole that runs behind the toes and then in between your big toe and other toes, it turns out to add to the comfort of the shoe immensely. That ridge forms in a short time to your foot, giving you your own custom fit. With these shoes I find i can stand longer and walk longer.<br />GRIP AND TRACTION: It has an anatomical outer sole that is very grippy, with a nice athletic shape, it gives good traction on sand, rock, mud, you name it. It is not slippery on wet surfaces like the dock, and the sole does not leave any marks on floors. The tread does not hold dirt in any grooves to track indoors. It is great for water use, and can be completely submerged with no damage. If it gets wet,the material that wicks the water away fast.<br />ODOR: It has an anti-microbial treatment that takes away any germs, I do not know how long that treatment lasts though. They do not get sweaty or smelly like my Crocs do.<br />DURABILITY: I got my money's worth out of them for sure. When my H2's get dirty, I throw them in the sink, under the hose, or even in the washer and they come out like new. I wore these almost daily for 4 months straight with no evidence of wear. It has now been 4 years and I still use them more than any other shoe in the summer. I hope they are still made as durable as they were when I bought mine. This includes vacation, in which I am standing in line all day at theme parks and scrambling at the beach. These come in many colors. For a dressier sandal I also like the brown Dunham Moose Fisherman (actually designed by New Balance). These sandals were good enough to get me to buy two tennis shoes from the same company in the last 4 years, an in-town shoe called Austin and an ugly hiker called the Targhee II. In the end, I just can't say enough about these shoes, I highly recommend.ooves to track indoors. It is great for water use, and can be completely submerged with no damage.

037571457X|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book but wasn't quite sure what it was about when I bought it. I was blown away by the story, the storytelling and the artwork. Satrapi is truly talented. She tells her story simply, through the eyes of herself as a child, describing the bloody revolution and wars in 1970s and 1980s Iran. With grace and wonder she describes how her world changed, from confidence to fear. I learned so much from this book, not just about the first-hand account of historic events, but more importantly how it affected individual families, and especially an imaginative little girl.  <br /> <br />Satrapi's art is reminiscient of 1930's woodblock prints--conveying a lot of emotion and subtlety through stark black and white images. This is a wonderful book.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|I first saw this when I was a kid, on On TV, not in the theatres.  It was probably a couple of years old by then, but I was entranced by all the different gangs, their bizarre costumes, the unfairness of the framing of them based solely on a very creepy David Patrick Kelly and his freaky bottles.  I even went so far as to track down the original book by Sol Yurick, which was checked out for about a year.  The book is radically different and quite an eye opener, i.e. it's not the comic-like cult film, it's read nasty, in your face, no happy self-examination of the lives their leading and the concept of getting out of it.  The library probably would have been slapped with child endangerment today for lending it out to an 11-year-old.<br /><br />That said, this is one of the few films that you think was totally awesome as a kid and DON'T cringe with embarassment when watching it as an adult.  Not that I'll be showing it to my son anytime soon.<br /><br />It was buying the new video game based on the movie and an ad in it that even alerted me to the director's cut.  The ad was, um, overenthusiastic.  They didn't weave cut scenes back in, there's no commentary, it's got funky comic-book like transition scenes that sometimes cut into scenes in such a way to actually lose a few lines.  That said, it does have a hefty amount of 'making of' featurettes, including interviewing several of the actors today.  Brace yourself, they're old now, but they have a lot of interesting things to say and are very thoughtful, intelligent, and profound.  The featurettes are what make this worth buying if you love the movie, but I will also keep the original version rather than getting rid of it as I usually do, just so I can go back and see the scenes without the comic book transitions.

0689854684|5.0|This book is a classic adventure story. I knew and loved it as a child, and as an adult am seeing my children know and love it too. The main characters are complex and intruiging. Long John Silver, while being the quintessential bad guy, still has a sense of honor. He was so good at seeming like a good guy that he had everyone fooled. This book is a stimulating read for grown ups as well as a captivating one for kids. It was written at a time when people didn't feel they had to pander to children by dumbing down their writing. It is a great vocabulary builder for kids also.
0684824906|4.0|One of the main attributes that shape the lives of great men is how they contended with adversities. And as we all know, adversities do come in various incarnations.<br /><br />This book, \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\", may not be the most complete work ever done on the political exploits of Mr. Lincoln; but, it certainly rates among the most intrinsic. Its candid portrayal of how the 16th president of the United States handled both the contentious issues and the contentious people of his time, is nonetheless insightful.<br /><br />Indeed, Doris Kearns Goodwin did her research well. This well-written and well-arranged compendium has the rare arresting-aura, which can keep one seated until the very last page of the 900+ paged book is read. Very few books, (which I have read in recent memory), possess this sort of electromagnetic induction.<br /><br />As the president whose election victory literally precipitated the Civil War, Mr. Lincoln did have more than enough folks to contend with. And the components of this \\"Team of Rivals\\", such strait-laced characters like: Edward Bates, Edwin M. Stanton, Salmon P. Chase, and William H. Seward, were by all means fiercely formidable.<br /><br />For sure, this book is worth the long wait, which I had to endure in faraway Switzerland, before it reached me. It is by no means a perfect piece. However, it remains an invaluable asset for any scholar whose interests include American history.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Honestly, I don't see how no one sees how transparent this band really is.  They have like 4 members that do pretty much nothing, while their image is a total gimmick...there are much better bands out there that don't have to have an image to make themselves successful. <br /> <br />And the music - <br />I once caught one of their performances on TV and their lead singer blew ass.  Learn to sing or growl, or scream so it doesn't like a baby being run over by a steamroller <br /> <br />Their guitarists - Mitch is an excellent guitarist (he used to be in a decent death metal band, I don't remember the name) but hes pretty much playing power chords for money here.  Same with the other one but he has no talent. <br />-This album has no solos like the other ones. <br /> <br />The drummer gives the best performance and hes mediocre at best.  See Christi, Hoglan or Portnoy for some exceptional drumming, for those of you that think \\"ZOMG JOEY BEST DRUMMAR EVAR THIS ALBUM BEZT I LIKE SlipknoT AND MUDVAYNEKAKAk\\" <br /> <br />The bass isnt even plugged in. <br /> <br />If it were possible, i'd give this album less stars.  But it isn't, so we'll settle for one. <br /> <br />For better metal listen to: Obituary, Death, Slayer, Sepultura (early), Strapping Young Lad, Cryptopsy, Deicide, Nile...I could go on for ages...
0451196716|5.0|There are horrors here that put to shame the parade of ghosts found elsewhere in King's opus. Here there is not a whiff of the supernatural, and yet in this powerful story lie the most haunting elements in all of King's books 1974 to the present. In an America of the not-too-distant future, a dictatorial figure oversees the new national pastime, \\"the long walk\\". This brutal gladiatorial contest is as the name suggests, a walk, but one with life or death consequences. We are introduced to gathering of young men from all avenues of existence and every corner of America, and these individuals begin a trek south at the Maine border. The only rule is that those competing must continue walking, non-stop, or be summarily executed by the squad of soldiers who follow along behind them. They go on, night, day, sunshine or storm, until only one remains. We meet the contestants, all well-sketched characters from King's early days, when his creative powers shone like a supernova, and we know that all but one of them must in the course of this rock-hard novella die. And one by one, they do. The Long Walk is the sort of book it is easy to underestimate at the start, and the kind of read that sticks with you for a long time. Along the course of its hundred-odd pages, virtually every emotion in the human soul is tapped and called upon. This is the book for those who snobbishly say Maine's most famous citizen has nothing \\"serious\\" to offer. Dare them to read this book, and then sit back and observe their reaction.
0385495315|4.0|Like many nerdy types, I've been interested in codes and ciphers since adolescence -- in my case, the mid-1950s. Being also a history junkie, in high school I read Chadwick's The Decipherment of Linear B, and in college, Tuchman's The Zimmerman Telegram, which confirmed my interest. (Both are covered here.) I picked up this book on a recommendation from a friend because of the accessible discussion of more recent topics, including \\"Pretty Good Privacy\\" and quantum cryptography, and while I found it necessary to skim lightly over some of the mathematical explanations, Singh's straightforward style and mastery of his subject made for an enjoyable weekend.
B000777J2S|3.0|I'm afraid that I belong to neither the love or hate group. I think that about 3 or 4 songs are worth it, and after hearing the first one I thought that I was in for a real treat! <br /> <br />Unfortunately the strong start doesn't continue, with me checking the elapsed time part-way through \\"You are my sister\\", thinking that it must be an extended song as it seemed like it had been dragging for a while. Imaging my surprise to see that it was the length of a slightly long but standard radio song! <br /> <br />I am a great lover of avant garde and other interesting music, but unfortunately this one doesn't quite cut it for me. It could be one that is visited once in a while for a change but the middle 4 lost me a bit due to unimaginative instrumentation and melodies.  <br /> <br />Full 5 stars for the good songs, the weaker ones drag it down a bit.

B0009MDPYM|3.0|You know Keanu was OK when he was a kid with his 'Bill and Ted' stuff, but starting with Speed, I thought of him as nothing much more than a buffoon. I just find him annoying.<br /><br />Well this flick is about angels and devils and how neither can enter our world but can only 'whisper in our ears'. Well Keanu attempted suicide as a boy, went to hell for two minutes and then came back to life. Now supposedly he's doomed to hell because suicide is a cardinal sin in the Catholic Church. So no matter what he does in his life he's going to hell. You will hear this no less than 20 times in the movie. So he's trying to buy his way into heaven by sending demons back to hell through exorcisms.<br /><br />Well we get a lot of explanations like how the Bible in hell tells a different story in Revelations. You got Satan's son being born, Gabriel trying to kill it, demons made of flies and snakes, and a voodoo witch doctor bar owner who stays neutral.<br /><br />If I may put forth a little bit of opinion. The dude who played Satan was the worst movie Satan I've ever seen. An old bald man is bad enough, but why was he dressed in a white? Like a heavenly white? I wasn't expecting horns, a pitchfork, and a red suit, but this is supposed to be Satan for crying out loud. With the money they spent on special effects, they could have at least delivered a frightening Satan. His demons were fifty times scarier than the Prince of Darkness himself.<br /><br />Well in a nutshell, Keanu still can't act and special effects carried the movie.
B0006399FS|5.0|One of the best productions by history's greatest rock band. To fans with lukewarm feelings, all I can say is go get some Vertigo Tour tickets and treat yourself to some life experience in the meantime. Real love is hard work, not a jingle, or a rhyme, or a subject for trite ode to fleeting passion. There isn't another act out there who could credibly and so memorably deal with the themes presented here.    Miracle Drug fuses faith WITH works, without which the former is clearly dead. \\"Love AND logic.\\" \\"Science AND the human heart.\\" Lyrics like these: \\"Freedom has a scent, like the top of a newborn baby's head...,\\" assume their place alongside some of the greatest ever written. Newborn babies do indeed have a scent: clean, innocent and new. This smell, this freedom from illness, from pain and poverty is no mere lyric or device; a baptism of effort and sacrifice is demanded. This music requires an answer. Listeners must become part of the solution envisioned, or become condemned by it.    Where Miracle Drug deals with serving and saving our fellow man (exemplified by AIDS-affliced Africans), Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own reckons with the consequences of a certain kind of domestic pathology. It's the best song on the CD and every bit as good as One. Specifically, Bono grapples with the strained relationship he had with his father after his mother died when he was a young teen. The good. The bad. Regrets. What might have been. How it could have been different. The song lays bare Bono's most deeply personal thoughts and feelings, and is sung in studio and live--each and every time--with an authentic emotional intensity rarely, if ever, heard in any rock song. (Only Johnny Cash's version of Hurt immediately comes to mind.)    My father passed away last year, and unlike Bono's father, mine was always kind and forgiving. I'm finding his shoes difficult to fill. I'm not quite the man or father mine was. Bono's song provides a lodestar for course correction. Fathers take heed. You needn't always be harsh. The house shouldn't be empty, or feel that way. It's ok to express love. Enjoy your children. Be interested in them. Wrap your arms around them. Silence is not always golden. Warm is better than cold. So much better!    Moreover, the song, like most of the rest on the CD, is deeply layered with Christian meaning. Phrases continually reveal themselves for those with ears to hear. \\"Let me take some of the punches for you tonight,\\" Bono pleads, reminiscent of the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Father Hewson's burdens could have been so much lighter, love could have taken so much weight off his shoulders, so much more joy could have been shared. One suspects Bono's own children are the beneficiaries of this conviction.     But so is he, and so is the band, and so are we all. \\"You're the reason why the opera is in me!\\" Bono credits his father. Thank Heaven.
B00005JO1G|4.0|Sam Mendes director of the dark suburban tale American Beuty and the 30's mobster movie of Road to Perdetion. Gives us another masterpiece, with Jarhead, based on the gulf war novel written by Anthony Swoffword. <br /> <br />In Jarhead, we see the making of a marine sniper from boot camp to the deserts of Kuwait. Swofford (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) lets you know right from the start that joining the suck wasn't the greatest of ideas. Swoff's experience at boot camp isn't much different then Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. In fact, it seems that the entire corp is fasnated with the way that the pop culture depicts them, as macho bad ass professional killers.  <br /> <br />  <br />When Gulf war begins, Swoff and his unit are deployed to defend the oil fields of Kuwait in opertaion desert shield. But, instead of crossing the broader and kicking ass, the marines find themselves doing nothing. It is here that Swoff must wrestle with the thoughts of loneiness and boredom. The fun comedic atmosphere of the movie is taken away as Swoff starts to worry what his girlfriend is doing with a \\"jody\\". To pass the time the marines bet on scorpian fights, writing letters, throwing parties, and masterbating (a lot!). Sgt Sykes often keeps the marines on their toes by forcing them to put on their MOBB gear despite the 123 degree temp. The football scene is probably one of the best in the movie. If your expecting to see a blackhawk down type of movie with non-stop action you will be let down. Swoff's story seems to be a story based on a man verses himself, rather then a man verses man. Swoff is very selfish. His main reasons for hating the corp is that it seperates him for his girlfriend and that its boring. So boring that he even ask a fellow marine to shoot him to \\"end the waiting\\". But Swoff also realize that for some people the suck means everything. \\"I want to do anything to get out, you want to do anything to get in\\" says Swoff to his friend Troy. Swoff begains to admire the comradery and friendship among his fellow marines. That once your a marine your always a marine. And that situtions like war seem to draw men closer to together in a common bond. A bond that includes the shamed Vietnam vets as well.  <br /> <br />Lucas Black who plays Kruger and Chris Cooper who plays Lt Col Kazinski are also pretty good. They seem to reinforce the typical marine sterotype. Kruger says some of the most dumbest if not funniest things in the movie. <br /> <br />Finally this is not an \\"anti war film.\\" Despite what some people who want to take advantage of certain situtions would say. If it is then im sorry i failed to see the anti war message. In fact, if i could get payed money to sit on my butt and do nothing in the desert...sign me up. As mentioned before its a movie about comradery and that for some people the corp means everything to them despite its flaws. <br /> <br />

B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is a five-star DVD, without question. The comic booklet and the DVD extras are amazing, and the movie...brilliant.

0790734850|5.0|\\"L.A. Confidential\\" is the story of three Los Angeles police officers who work in a rather corrupt department in 1953.  Bud White (Russell Crowe) has a violent temper and is not above beating up a suspect to get answers.  Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) loves the spotlight; he's the technical consultant for a TV show and takes bribes from a gossip columnist.  Exley (Guy Pearce) is a young, straight-arrow cop who wants to live up to his late father's reputation.  Together, they investigate some murders that may involve a high-priced call-girl (Oscar-winner Kim Basinger).<br /><br />This movie is often described as a \\"film noir,\\" and that kept me from seeing the movie for a long time.  But I do like the movie a lot; the actors are all wonderful and there are several twists to the story.  It is an ensemble piece; the four stars give exciting, yet understated performances, and James Cromwell, as the police captain, and Danny De Vito, as the tabloid writer, are also outstanding.  This is a trip back to days of \\"Dragnet,\\" with interesting characters, some violence, and lots of suspense.  Heartily recommended.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Practically all we know of the Trojan War came down to us from Homer's Iliad and I had expected that this movie would bear some resemblance to the story.  There was some resemblance, but not all that much. <br /> <br />When Helen was taken from Sparta, it was supposed to be when Menelaus was away at a funeral, but not in this movie.  The war lasted for 10 years, and it was compressed in the movie to weeks, or maybe a couple of months.  That is some difference from Homer's depiction of it.  Paris was supposed to be killed at Troy and Helen didn't escape.  Also, Menelaus was not killed at Troy, and neither was Agamemnon.  In Homer Menelaus got Helen back and returned home, and Agamemnon returned home also, but brought Priam's daughter Cassandra with him and was killed, at home, in his bathtub, by his wife and her lover. <br /> <br />I have to wonder why a more faithful story was not made.  The original is exciting enough, with no need for the dramatic excesses invented for this movie. <br /> <br />The Iliad is not all that long a book and would be more worthwhile, more entertaining, and more rewarding than watching this nonsensical movie.
B000AA305M|1.0|With all due respect to the reviewers who don't think that the copy protection is an issue, they are missing the point. <br /> <br />For the record, I have no problem with artists and record companies who wish to protect their intellectual property.  At issue here is the technological means employed by Sony. <br /> <br />When you play Sony's CDs on your computer, \\"rootkit\\" software is installed.  It enforces the copy protection by intercepting all communication to and from the CD drive.  Although not a virus in itself (it won't attempt to spread itself to other machines), it employs many of the same techniques used by viruses, to make it next to impossible to detect and remove.  This software has many unfortunate side effects, including the potential to crash your computer, the creation of a backdoor for other viruses (any file or registry key beginning with certain characters is hidden from the operating system), and a small but continuous drain on your computer's processing power - even when you aren't listening to music. <br /> <br />In response to criticism, Sony has released a patch.  But this patch only mitigates the problem of the virus-hiding potential.  The software remains nearly impossible to remove.  Incorrect attempts to remove it can render your CD drive unusable. <br /> <br />If you like Gray's music, and if the CD will play on your home stereo, then have at it.  But if your intention is to play it on your computer, then I'm afraid that the only safe way to do so is to create or obtain a copy that illegally circumvents the copy protection. <br /> <br />for further information, search for \\"sory rootkit\\" on the sysinternals website.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I first saw the Cream in NYC just after Fresh Cream was released and they were essentially unknown.  I immediately bought their first album and, in the years since, all the rest.  <br /> <br />I didn't hesitate to buy this DVD, which is very well done, from a technical point of view, but the band is much older and are showing their age. They're all over 60 now, and 39 years have passed from the day they began together. They all look a bit discheveled in some of the footage. Jack Bruce looks as if he rolled out of a bed and came directly to the show, without even running a brush through his hair!  Even so, they all play wonderfully.  However, the original studio recordings are better than this live performance.  The group comes across as a bit tired, and the frenetic energy of the original studio recordings is a bit lacking on some songs, like NSU. Eric is playing his Strat, rather than the Les Paul or SG he had for the original recordings and so the tone on his guitar is different.  His solos are different as well and not necessarily better than the originals. In the interviews, Jack Bruce said they intentionally avoided the temptation to recreate the past but to reunite as they are today.  There are great performances by all three.  I loved the alternate version of \\"We're going Wrong.\\"  Eric's playing on that was superb.   <br /> <br />I recommend this without qualification. If you grew up in the 60s as I did, and have all of Eric's other CDs as I do, or if you play guitar, you will love it.  After watching it, the same thought occurred to me as in 1966... \\"what group is better than the Cream? Only the Beatles!\\"
B00003CXC6|5.0|Yes, this is a very important and influential movie, but it is also fascinating to watch.  Made more than fifty years ago, only five years after the end of World War II, it holds up extremely well and even without understanding all or even most of the things in the movie that speak directly to Japanese culture.  The movie challenges us by providing us a sense of reality and then undermining our certainty.  At the end of the movie it is common for a viewer to think that there is no independent reality, that reality is simply a personal construct and that all our personal \\"stories\\" are simply lies.  That is indeed a very twentieth century post-modern college sophomore lesson to derive from it.<br /><br />The story opens with two men sitting forlornly at the ruined Rashomon (Dragon gate) outside twelfth century Kyoto.  It is pouring rain and they keep muttering that they don't understand, they don't believe what they have recently been through.  An unnamed man, obviously a poor and very cynical individual, joins them inside the structure to get out of the rain.  He breaks off pieces of the structure to make a fire and, overhearing the muttering, and asks the men to tell what it is they don't understand.<br /><br />The woodcutter tells how he went into the woods to get the firewood he sells and came upon a body and ran to get the police.  We learn that the other man is a priest and his encounter with the man and his wife before they met the bandit.  The woodcutter then recounts the trial of a bandit. Tajomaru (Mifune) and his testimony of how he came to kill the man and rape his wife.  After the testimony we think we have the story.  However, they then bring in the wife who has been found hiding out.  She tells a completely different story including the statement that SHE killed her husband.<br /><br />The dead man testifies through a woman who evokes his spirit.  She becomes possessed and recounts what he knows about his death.  He doesn't know who killed him or who removed the weapon.  The cynical man senses something is wrong with the woodcutter's story and challenges him to tell what really happened.  We then get another very different version.<br /><br />There is much more to the story than this broad outline, but I don't want to take away from your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />There is a very interesting commentary on the disk by Donald Richie, an authority on the films of Kurosawa.  He sounds a lot like a professor teaching undergraduates driving home the same points multiple times.  One of them is that every one of the speakers has his or her own story and that each is true for them and that there is no other truth to know.<br /><br />This is clearly a lesson you could learn from the film, but that would be like learning you can never get a pepperoni and mushroom pizza because the driver delivered a ham and pineapple pizza instead.  It may well be that there is no perfect or Platonic Ideal pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  Some may have more pepperoni than others, others may use different kinds of mushrooms.  What is pizza anyway?  Yet, when I give you a pizza, you know if it is pepperoni and mushroom or something else, right?<br /><br />As for the impossibility of reconciling these stories, well, we have forensics nowadays.  Even before scientific analysis, intelligent folks could and did compare the various testimonies given and then did some analysis to come up with a more likely scenario that is different than any individual testimony.  It will also likely be incomplete and wrong in details, but will reveal more than accepting only one version or none.<br /><br />It is also important to remember that the testimonies recounted here are also not direct, but are also recounted by the woodcutter even though we see them as if they were direct accounts.  So, there is another level of potential distortion.  And it is clear that everyone here is indeed bearing false witness.  This is a very different thing than a person who is trying to provide a truthful account, but is limited by the human condition and is only able to provide a partially complete version (even with errors).  This kind of error is quite different than a conscious lie that is meant to deceive.  The person telling a real lie often understands how their story differs from reality because they are calculating their distortion to be believable but deceptive.  It may be that they eventually commit so strongly to the lie that they forget reality, but others can still get closer to what really happened than accepting the lie at face value and shrugging one's shoulders saying, \\"Well, what can you do.  It is his reality.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fascinating and important film.  Watch it and enjoy!human condition and is only able to provide a partially complete version (even with errors).

B000001FSU|5.0|This is my favorite Anthrax album, EVER!!  The song writing is catchy, with great inner-song changeups and progressions!  I am baffled by the negative reviews of this album.  I will never forget buying this tape on a choir trip in 6th grade (1988) and listening to it with my walkman on the buss.  I bought it because I liked the album cover (lol) and had heard from older friends that Anthrax was heavy, thrash metal style (I was like 10 or 11 years old).  The experience changed my life!  I remember riding through the Tennessee mountains listening to State of Euphoria, absolutely mesmerized.  Get it!!!
B000A6CLL0|3.0|Great show!  Really it is...   <br /> <br />But WTF?  $80 or higher a season?   <br /> <br />what makes em think we'll pay twice as much for a season of star trek than any other series? <br /> <br />I'll pass till they can figure out the real market value of this franchise
B00005JO17|3.0|Ok, maybe 3.5, maybe 4 at most....My major thing with this is that it is a lot darker than the trailers let on.  There are a few creepy moments,the treatment of Chicken Little is way mean spirited, the movie is oddly structured(not that little kids, I have an 8 year old who liked it, care about structure)with a baseball subplot.  There is a lot of destruction and characters getting evaporated(yes, it is all made good in the end  but wow, it is a little overwhelming.)  I am not in anyway an alarmist.(the sky is not falling)  I just want people to know what they are getting into.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film  is pleasant.  It tries hard to be \\"cutting edge\\", with clever beginnings and such, but really, Disney is pulling out of its own well.  We have the making fun of merchandising stuff(see aladdin), the lion king references(see lion king 1.5), nods to things like war of the worlds(just when you are thinking \\"god, this is like War of The Worlds\\" a character steps in and says \\"  This is like War of The Worlds\\").<br /><br />The voice work is great, Chicken Little himself is so darn cute,  Garry Marshall does a great job as the dad.<br /><br />Other fun things include a look at middle school(funny moment when all the kids pull out their cells.  I teach high school and can relate), and some fun side characters.  You know, the misfits.  I found it typical that the fat pig was played as a music loving misfit with a streisand collection, but there are a few good jokes.<br /><br />And ultimately it becomes a story about fathers and sons, which I am a sucker for.<br /><br />So I am sort of on the fence.  I am sure your kids will like it if they are not afraid of loud noises(in the spaceship....yes, I said spaceship)...but like a few of the more recent disney things(Valiant, Home on The Range) it has a reasonable premise<br /><br />dwarfed by selfconscious(sic) references, odd shock value and meanspiritedness.  As a parent you might have some explaining to do.<br /><br />(and buy the way...the attached trailer for the ant bully, another disney film, ends horrifyingly.  beware)he way...the attached trailer for the ant bully, another disney film, ends horrifyingly.  beware)
0449227421|1.0|...and you can get a pretty good idea of the awfulness of this book.  There's a place for simple, entertaining literature out there, and I recognize it.  One can be economical with words, and there's not necessarily any need for stylistic flair, polish, or ornamentation in popular books. <br /> <br />Still, this is insulting.  Follett is a published novelist, for goodness' sake; there's no reason for grammatical or punctuation errors to show up.  If poor proofreading were the extent of the problems, of course, that would be forgivable, but to call the dialogue and exposition \\"stilted\\" or \\"cliched\\" would be generous.  How could anyone wade through this tripe?  The bad guys are broad-brushed Nixons with daddy issues, and the good guys are \\"brilliant\\" Barbie-and-Ken types who speak like high-schoolers reading from a play script.  Is it too much to ask for exposition to be kept out of the mouths of characters?  How about a prepositional phrase to begin a sentence? <br /> <br />I'd love to like this book, and have nothing against techno-thrillers, but the poor quality of the writing is just distracting.
0375713751|5.0|I bought this book at the Houston airport, in one of the 9 trips that kept me away from home, my husband and my 1 1/2 year old baby girl 22 days in that single month. <br />I almost start crying at gate B forty something(and this is a very funny book! I swear!, but this part...) reading the very first chapter, when Kate is trying to make some pies she just bought look \\"home made\\" by pressing them, because her daughter has an event the next day and she doesn't want to have her little girl be the one who's mommy didn't have time to bake something. When her husband comes down (4 am) and tells her no one is expecting her (Kate) to do that, and she answers \\"I am!\\", I had this feeling that I was looking myself in a mirror. <br />Different culture (I'm Mexican), different personalities, very different job, and not always what I would have done, but I identified with every fear, every joy, every truthful confession, every inner conflict of the character. The only thing that makes me sad is that I doubt I'll find another novel I will like this much; I might find some that are excellent, but I don't believe it will be easy to have that \\"mirror\\" experience again. <br />Ms. Pearson, if you read this stuff: Excelente, Felicidades... y Muchas Gracias directly from Mexico. <br /> <br />
0553288105|5.0|This is Asimov at his best, no doubt about it. But besides all the tour de force about paralell universes and so on (which is, indeed, one of the other amazing aspects of the book)what Asimov really does here is an analysis on what drives people and about what one considers to be more important in life. Readers of Sci-Fi usually enjoy the genre because it deals with the non-trivial. And here the Master offers a view on the ones who disregard grand scale happenings, such as saving the world, and prefer to engage themselves on daily life issues instead. And Asimov insinuates, or better, exposes, that perhaps even those who whish to do something for mankind are actually driven by the most selfish of the reasons... The characters are well developed, and they all carry that naive touch that permeates all Asimov's works. The Master uses them magically to show his argument: is it more important to raise kids, or to learn and discover? Or both of these are equally part of the game, being both not only acceptable aproaches to life, as well as complementary ones? Are alien beings capable of communicating with us, even capable to feel fear, anger and love? There are lots of other ideas such as these throghout the book, not to mention the purely scientif possibilities that are raised... This is a masterpiece. It leads to thinking on various levels and, best of all, it is very entertaining.<br /><br />As Voltaire put it: \\"The superfluous is very necessary\\". Asimov blends the superfluous and the necessary wonderfully.
0446577383|4.0|Unlike some reviewers who lowly rate a book for no other reason than they happen to disagree with the writer's politics, I am rating this book based only on its entertainment value.  Pure and simple, it is a fun book that builds suspense, which results in a page turning adventure.      As others have said, The Camel Club is about four men, eccentrics all, who, while holding their secret \\"Camel Club\\" (conspiracy theorists) meeting, stumble on a murder in progress.  The story moves along at a brisk pace with good dialogue, lots of action, a little romance, and remembrance of lost loves.  The Camel Club members try to solve this murder on their own because they have all had previous run-ins with, and are known by the local legal authorities. They  realize no one would believe them even if they came forward with what they saw.  As it is, the hunters become the hunted and the story turns into a race to produce the proof, before the murderers can launch an even more deadly series of events.     Most readers will not be disappointed, particularly if you are new to Baldacci.  Some reviewers had lamented the fact that Camel Club is not up to the standards of his previous works.  Apparently they have not read Saving Faith, Simple Truth, and Last Man Standing.  This book is as well written as those.  It is a very good book, but not as good as Baldacci's best and it would be hard for every book he writes to be his best (just like any other writer).    Baldacci does take some cheap political swipes and falls into that mindset that all the folks we go to war with are the good guys and that everyone in our government is either one of the bad guys or a nitwit.  I think Baldacci may be a lot like the crazy characters in this book, which isn't really a bad thing!  The book is still a hoot and a great addition to your library of suspense/thriller books.

B000BW7QX6|5.0|From the first minute to the very last, the movie Serenity simply does not let up. It's a roller-coaster of emotions, you won't go five minutes without laughing at something happening or something being said, and you won't go a minute without wondering if everybody's gonna make it out alive from this escapade. You will laugh, you might cry, you will definitely be shocked, but you will never be bored! This is simply movie-making at it's finest, and the best movie I've ever seen. No comparison.
B00005JLWN|4.0|What is \\"Equilibrium\\"?<br /><br />Take equal portions of \\"1984\\", \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", \\"Brave New World\\", and \\"THX1138\\", throw in some generous servings of gunkata and wire-fu, add a dollop of the twin-Desert Eagle-wielding whirling dervish of destruction that is Christian Bale's Grammaton Cleric, and you have the shiny-happy-people-holding-hands world that is \\"Equilibrium.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, it's derivative. Sure, it's fluffy. But boy oh boy is it fun to watch, and if there's a moral to this story, it's this: sometimes the best thing to do is to self-medicate.<br /><br />It is 2172 in the Republic of Libria, and the future's so bright we've *all* gotta wear shades---and take our Meds.<br /><br />But it's a fragile future: all citizens maintain a constant dose of the wonder drug Prozium, taken at regular intervals and available at Equilibrium distribution centers throughout the City. Prozium induces a perfectly level emotional state, flattening the mountains and filling the valleys. Prozium lets you cope, Citizen.<br /><br />It's your restroom break, and a jackbooted black-visored thug in full battle dress with a fully locked-and-loaded streetsweeper is gonna give you a little escort to the potty. Your reaction? No worries. Told to stomp puppies in the street or club baby harp seals to death? No worries.<br /><br />You get to spend most of your day gazing up at the huge, bloated, godlike head of Sean Pertwee (\\"Father\\", Equilibrium's economy-class rendition of Big Brother) blaring away at you 24/7. Your reaction? Hey man, it's cool.<br /><br />Yup: Prozium is a real wonder-drug. And if you miss your dosage? See those big guys in the leather trenchcoats with the black-visored helmets and the itchy trigger fingers?<br /><br />Of course, there is another way: go off the Prozium, quit cold turkey, begin to feel, start an art collection. Trouble is, government in the world of Equilibrium doesn't come calling with public donations to your arts foundation or underground symphony.<br /><br />They come with a Death Squad.<br /><br />They send in Society's ultimate weapon: the Disciples of the Tetragrammaton---the Grammaton Cleric. The Grammaton Clerics let the shock troops do all the initial wetwork and perimeter-securing, stride into the dark little warrens where you and your Picasso-loving rebel scum are hiding, show off their astounding Gunkata (a discipline where the adept wields his weapons in mathematically and geometrically precise sweeps and arcs designed to maximize carnage on the enemy and minimize damage to the Cleric. It's neat. Where do I sign up?), provide you with about 300 extra air-holes free of charge, and then pay you and your \\"Feelings\\" the ultimate compliment: they introduce a little napalm and chordite appliqu&eacute; to your bootleg copy of the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />That sounds pretty harsh, you might say. And I might say: consider the alternative: the brutal b*tch for humanity that was the 20th century. Father would back me up, citizen. Mankind nearly didn't survive. We made it through four World Wars, nuclear apocalypse, mass murder, environmental catastrophe, ecological collapse, mass genocide and ethnic cleansing, even 24-hour Jerry Springer episodes.<br /><br />Prozium is far better than the alternative. The problem starts when Grammaton Cleric Preston (Bale, who is so good he makes you cares despite the overall silliness) goes off his meds.<br /><br />Alright: first off, I was told \\"Equilibrium\\" was a mind-f*ck flick: much like the Matrix. I expected that Bale's character, once off the drug, would start realizing that something truly horrible was up---like, you know, when Rowdy Roddy Piper in \\"They Live\\" when Piper puts on the shades and realizes the yuppies are actually revolting outer-space monsters with meaty, veiny heads. Something like that.<br /><br />I thought maybe Bale would discover that Libria was ruled by giant carnivorous pink lemurs, or that the citizens of Libria were actually being forced to eat their own snot while Father took pictures and laughed.<br /><br />Nothing at all like that, I'm afraid. Bale wakes up, starts grooving on fine art and getting down with his erstwhile buddy Partridge(another great, grounded performance by Sean Bean)'s sudden interest in the poetry of Yeats, and starts to feel. You can probably connect the dots and fill in the plot from there.<br /><br />But that said, \\"Equilibrium\\"---which doesn't have an original bone in its sleek little body---entertains. Director Kurt Wimmer has certainly added something to the bubbling cauldron of cultural Cool with Gunkata: even if it's not a real martial art, it should be. I'd take lessons.<br /><br />The acting is the glue that holds the flick together: Bale is astonishingly good here and provides the movie with so much gravity that it seems more profound than it actually is. Good job! Sean Bean is equally excellent: the two make such a convincingly formidable duo that a `twist' 15 minutes into the film is actually compelling. I've never been a big Angus Macfadyen (Dupont; the actor was Robert the Bruce in \\"Braveheart\\") fan: he doesn't give me any reasons to start here. Maybe it's the weak chin and the pouty face.<br /><br />And the movie looks absolutely awesome: the firefights are great, the choreography is stunning, Kurt Wimmer keeps the pacing so tight that even as the wheels come off the wagon and the seams start showing, you're just so overloaded you don't notice. As for the film's big `message': is Utopia worth the emotional price?<br /><br />I don't know about that, and I don't know that I care. Things blowing up? Check! Christian Bale looking hip and sleek as he robs Neo's wardrobe? Check! Lots of wire-fu and gunkata-fu? Check and check! Hip white cadillac with white interior you get to drive if you make it through Grammaton Cleric training?

0375405380|5.0|I find two varieties of five-star reads.  Page-turners both, there are those that hit you like the best action movies - a quick rush, great fun while they last, a lightning shot of adrenaline - and all but forgotten a month or so down the road.  And then there are the very special books that deliver all the thrills, the action, all the suspense while at the same searing an unshakable image in your soul that you know will stay with you for a very long time.  Don Winslow's remarkable \\"Power of the Dog\\" is firmly in the latter camp.<br /><br />Contemporary history buffs my remember US DEA Special Agent Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Camarena who, while assigned in Mexico in 1985, was abducted, tortured, and brutally murdered by Mexican drug lords.  While Winslow changes the names, the events leading to and subsequent to Camarena's murder play a central role in this epic tale of the violence, corruption, love, betrayal, and vengeance surrounding three decades worth of the trafficking of cocaine and heroine by Mexican drug cartels.  So grand in scope, so exhaustively researched, and so authoritative in its delivery of the facts, and comparisons or analogies are strained.  But for a starter, consider a role up of  \\"Traffic\\", \\"The Godfather\\", and \\"Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia\\".  Winslow manages to demystify the shady politics and clandestine operations of Nicaragua and the Sandanistas and the Iran-Contra affair, the 1994 assassination of Mexican Presidential candidate Luis Colosio, NAFTA and others in enough detail to qualify as a docudrama, while the unspeakable brutality, depravity, and evil that travels alongside the drug trade is, well, plainly spoken.  Winslow weaves tight story lines from Mexico's deserts and poppy fields to the Tijuana/San Diego borderland battlegrounds to New York City's Hell's Kitchen and Bensonhurst.  His characters are much too real to be expected between the pages of pop fiction - all too believable in their flaws, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and failures.<br /><br /> In the end, it would not be giving anything away to say that the vaunted war on drugs is ultimately a war of futility.  Drugs pour into the US in ever-greater quantities while drug lords get richer and the American taxpayer pours increasingly more money to fund corrupt politicians and dubious strategies.  Notwithstanding, \\"The Power of the Dog\\" is a powerful and unapologetic tale of bitter fatalism, of redemption that rings ultimately hollow.  If you are squeamish, or intend to keep naive delusions of our \\"noble\\" fight against drugs intact, this is probably not the book for you.  But for what is bound to become a classic, plumbing the depths of evil in this dark history we'd probably all prefer to ignore, you simply must read this novel.and failures. <br /> <br /> In the end, it would not be giving anything away to say that the vaunted war on drugs is ultimately a war of futility.

B0007WZUMO|5.0|There's so much said about the album, so much that's still to be said, but I want to keep it short here. Owning the album since the Japan release on April 27, 2005, I've been listening to it back and forth, up and down, driving, cycling, walking the roads and streets, and sometimes at home. It's become part of my diet, so to speak, and for me, it would be ***absolutely incomplete without the Japan bonus tracks***, especially \\"Home\\". - \\"I used to know who I was... until you came along\\" This line recalls in me deeply the memory of meeting my soul mate here, as a matter of personal experience. This may not be valid for everyone, but IMHO \\"Home\\" and \\"Right where it belongs\\" are complementary, vital tracks on \\"With Teeth\\"; without them, some teeth would be missing.
B00005YJMX|4.0|Werner Herzog's re-make of Nosferatu the Vampyre is a \\"very\\" stylish take on the Count Dracula legend that has all the earmarks of its director. Not having seen F.W. Murnau's original, I have to believe Herzog was making an homage to those pre-war German artists and filmmakers who brought forth the style that more or less defines what we've come to know as early 20th Century German Expressionism -- Klimt, Beckmann, Nolde, Kokoschka, Murnau, et al. -- and what the Nazis ultimately deemed to be \\"degenerate art\\". Linear storytelling is often eschewed in favor of pure expressionist filmmaking. Shots and sequences are not framed and lit for visual agreeableness but for pure emotional impact. Script and speech acting are minimized and understated for the sake of visual emotiveness, much as the great films of the silent era. In these regards, Herzog has made a successful film which those who admire his unique aesthetic will certainly enjoy. Herzog's use of symbolic motifs, especially those of teeming critters in the midst of Dutch seaside society, will delight his fans and gloriously confound Herzog newbies!  <br /> <br />The film itself is more eerie as opposed to scary. From its opening handheld sequence of corpses frozen in their terror and torment, to the severe forebodings of the gypsies, the ominous depiction of Black Death, and the hideous visage of the Vampyre himself (Klaus Kinski at his tastefully tortured best!); a marvelous spinetingling gloom pervades the proceedings that stops just short of outright camp...then takes a few memorable left turns! <br /> <br />The castle, the Transylvanian landscape, and the town of Wismar are wonderfully depicted. Isabelle Adjani is most adequate as Lucy; the wan, terror-stricken, shrinking violet of a wife who's also the Count's \\"special interest\\". Bruno Ganz as her devoted husband Jonathon, a real estate agent driven by the promise of a fat commission to travel four weeks across Europe to meet with his ghoulish prospective client, is obviously having fun in a somewhat stilted performance that sometimes crosses that wispy thread-like line into camp. Others play their roles to the hilt under Herzog's singular direction.  <br /> <br />One wonders, when all is said and done, what will ultimately become of property values in Wismar! <br />
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This box set is a must for Batman fans. It includes the four films (in widescreen) produced between 1989-1997. The two disc editions include commentaries on each film by the directors, and excellent documentaries covering the production of each film in detail. There are surprisingly candid comments from both Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher about the films, and the direction the studio wanted each of them to take with their respective projects.  <br />Here's a brief recap of the four films: <br />Batman (1989) - Batman vs. the Joker (wildly played by Jack Nicholson), excellent production design, great atmosphere. <br />Batman Returns (1992) - Batman vs. Penguin (Danny Devito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) in a a dark, moody sequel. Seen as a disappointment upon release, it improves with age. Great score by Danny Elfman, excellent performances all around. <br />Batman Forver (1995) Exit Burton and Michael Keaton, enter Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer for a lighter, more action-oriented installment with Jim Carrey as The Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face.  Lighter in tone, but great fun. <br />Batman & Robin (1997) - what many consider the nadir of the series, as George Clooney takes over as Batman, and Schumacher takes things much closer to the camp spirit of the tv show. Messy plot, overwhelming at times, but still fun if youre more in the mood for something in the style of the 60s tv series. Not as strong as \\"Forever\\" though Uma Thurman is fun as Poison Ivy and Arnold Shwarzenegger is ok as Mr. Freeze. Definitely the least of the series, with interesting comments from some of the participants on the extras on where it went wrong. <br />All in all, an essential set, even if you only want two or three of the films. Try a Bat-marathon, including the 1966 tv spinoff  \\"Batman: The Movie\\" and Chris Nolans excellent \\"Batman Begins\\" from this past summer, which are not included in the set. <br />
B00005JNQS|5.0|In 2002, 20th Century Fox released Ice Age starting Ray Romano. And look who else is making a comeback to animation, Robin Williams, the last animated movie that he did that was in theatres was 1992's Aladdin, even through at the time of making thier was problems between him and Disney, he returned as the voice of the Genie in the 3rd and final chapter of the Aladdin series, that was a direct to video release.  <br /> <br />Robots has the same team that directed Ice Age, Carlos Saldanha & Chris Wedge, whom started animating this movie after the release of Ice Age. And I haven't heard of an animated movie being planned by 20th Centuray Fox for 2008, so it could be a while before we see another animated movie from them.  <br /> <br />The movie opens with Mr. Copperbottom (Stanley Tucci) with news that he and his wife Mrs. Copperbottom (Dianne Wiest) are expecting a son. But he arrives late for the delievery, which is not a doctor that is over at the house. And soon comes their son they name Rodney, who soons notices TV-personality Mr. Bigweld (Mel Brooks) , but of course at first he doesn't know who is, but becomes a fan, and since he has his own company. Rodney (Ewan McGregor) even showx up at his dad's work, with a new invention, which causes a problem with his dad's boss (Lowell Ganz). Which leads Rodney decide to go to Robot City, to meet and show his invetion to his hero Mr. Bigweld, and even with an little engourment, even against his own mother's wishes. Whiel there he meets Fender (Robin Williams) even when he is trying to get directions to Mr. Bigweld's factory. But it seems like the gate guard (Paul Giamatti) won't let Rodney in, even after qutie a roller coaster trip to get thier. It aslo looks like Phineus T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) has replaced him, and his Mom's  (Jim Broadbent) idea to get rid of Mr. Bigweld, and have the town's robots parts from being fix, and more of an upgrade.
B0000A118M|5.0|When he made this album, John Coltrane considered it to be his gift to God. It's certainly worthy of that status, having some really amazing instrumentals, including, of course, John Coltrane's masterful saxaphone playing. I'm a drummer, and I can testify that this album is also a prime example of really skillful jazz percussion. If you're looking to start a really fine jazz collection, this would be an important album to include. <br /> <br />If you liked this, I recommend Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps.\\" It's a little bit less serious, slightly more bouncy, but of similar excellence.
B00004X01U|5.0|I do not understand why some people don't like this album; in my opinion is just one of the best Madonna' album!  Music contains some great tracks such as Don't tell me, What it feels like for a girl, I deserve it and Gone, a terrific ballad which gives the most beautiful ending for a Madonna's album.  The only weak point of this album are Runaway lover and Amazing: both of whom are co-write with William Orbit, but his sound is too different from the rest of the track list, devoted to the French touch of Mirwais.  Anyway, this album is FANTASTIC!!!!  P.S. Just one question for Madonna; why only three singles?!?
B00009W0U4|5.0|I  can't  say  anything  different  here  that  anyone  else  hasn't  already  said  about  this  shocker,  and  im  glad  i  bought  it ... im  still trying  to  get  over  the  anger  i felt while  picking   my  mouth  up  from  the  floor.  I  loved  it.  Made  my  blood  boil  and  my  skin  crawl.  I  guess  it's  just  one  of  those  things  that  you  hate  to  love,  and  love  to  hate.   Just  one  thing  though;  I  would've  realy  loved   bashing  in  the  brains  of  the  guy  who  came  to  the  tunnel  hallway  and  saw,  and  walked  away  and  did  nothing...id  get  him  just  before  id  go  after  The Tenia.        If  you   do  like  getting   thown  for  a  loop  and  enjoy  having  your   emotions   rattled   then   by  all  means  get  this.    Thank  you  for  reading.      PS.  Two  thumbs  up  for you  Gaspar Noe!
B000094HMU|5.0|1. Hope...I hope you will buy this dvd.  One of the best opera that I have seen on DVD.   <br />2. Blood...This cast has passion.  Levine is divine.  Domingo is a strong Calaf with a dramatic voice that soars over Puccini's masterpiece.  His acting is tremendous as usuall.  Mitchell is the bonus of this great cast.  She sings flawlessly and one of the best Liu I have heard.   <br />3. Turandot...Eva Marton might not be the best Turandot, but that does not matter.  When she and Domingo were singing in act III it was magic.  When she was shedding tears while singing my heart palpitated to a renewed passion of why I loved Opera to begin with.  My eyes and ears where glued to my home theater.  For all I care Marton and Domingo could have cracked their voices and it would have not mattered to me a bit, cause folks the stars were alligned right over the Met that night.  I have not seen Metha's version of the Turandot, but this is the best Turandot I have seen so far.
B00006LLOG|5.0|\\"Transformer\\" was Reed's second solo album. It was produced David Bowie and Mick Ronson and recorded at Trident studios in England. The Bowie/Ronson influence on Lou Reed's sound is very obvious, especially if you compare it to his first solo album. Many tracks give remindings of both \\"Honky Dory\\" and \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", and Bowie himself appear on backing-vocals on several tracks.<br /><br />Lou Reed's songwriting was never better than on this album, and with musicians like Mick Ronson, Klaus Voorman and other skilled people, the album was almost bound to be a classic. And time has proved it to be!<br /><br />There is a great variety of styles, and the Reed, Bowie, Ronson team is capable of handling them all. The opening track \\"Vicious\\" is one of Reed's greatest rockers. \\"Perfect Day\\" is such a beautiful ballad. \\"Satellite of Love\\" such a catchy pop-tune; lots of Bowie influence on this. \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" was Lou Reed's commercial break-though and \\"Andy's Chest\\" is an often overlooked pearl with a great build-up. And the rest of the album is just great.<br /><br />This is simply a five star plus classic album!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|\\"Underworld\\" takes two staples of horror - the vampire and the werewolf - and matches them against each other in an action-movieesque power struggle, with a strong romantic element at its heart.  I'll admit that from the trailers I didn't know if this would work - the love angle sounded fine, but I thought if you're going to have a vampires vs. werewolves war, why give them so much heavy firepower that it's going to change it from a horror movie into a straight-out action movie?  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.  While the firepower and the swords do allow \\"Underworld\\" to function as a first-rate action film, they do not, in my opinion, hold the movie back from being a whale of a horror movie as well.  Of all the martial arts/swirling swords/blazing guns and black leather horror out there that have formed their own little genre (\\"Blade\\" trilogy, \\"The Crow\\" movies, etc.), this and the \\"Resident Evil\\" movies sit atop the mountain.  \\"Underworld\\" far surpassed any expectations I had for it. <br /> <br />  A centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves (known as Lycans in the \\"Underworld\\" mythos) forms the scenario and the launching point, with the vampires currently in the winning position but with new developments in the wings for both clans that may shift the balance.  The lead vampire is Selene (the gorgeous and perfectly attired Kate Beckinsale), a ruthlessly efficient 'Death Dealer' (vampire assasin) out to avenge the deaths of her previous (human) family at the hands of rogue Lycans, and she's brought into contact with a mortal named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who may be the key to creating a perfect vampire/werewolf hybrid that would be more powerful or dangerous than either species.  The romantic story that slowly builds is never forthright but obvious nonetheless; it's 'felt' far more than 'seen' through the movie.  A labyrinth of power alliances and ancient secrets sets the balance of the war - and several of the cast of characters's placeswithin it - spinning. <br /> <br />   The pantheons of werewolves and vampires remain credible horror creatures, their use of modern weaponry and martial arts fighting techniques (the latter mostly just for the vampires) serving not only to make the show more appealing for action fans but to differentiate the characters from those in previous great vampire and/or werewolf movies (\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", the \\"Ginger Snaps\\" movies, the Hammer movies, \\"Dracula's Curse\\", etc.)  And \\"Underworld\\" and \\"Blade\\" and such are actually helping the whole genre by Not retreading the ground that's been done so effectively before (although occsionally a werewolf or vampire movie like the just-mentioned \\"Dracula's Curse\\" will come along and work the traditional territory and still be fresh and awesome) but by forging out new screen territory for these classic creatures to operate in.  Fellow horror fans will be happy to know that the action isn't confined to machine guns and swords - the Lycans are lethally effective in the fang-and-claw department, and both sides make use of more olden weapons (whips, cudgels, etc.), sometimes modified a bit for the creature's attributes.  I.E. a Lycan can wield a far bigger and heavier cudgel or mace far more effectively than even the strongest human ever could.  I'd like to see these weapons get more screentime in the sequel(s), just as I think it might not be a bad idea to take another classic race of monsters (maybe gargoyles or goblins?) and put a new spin on them.  To keep going and be just as great as the first one they're going to have to add in some new characters beyond Selene et al., and there's no reason not to go beyond the established races of vampire, werewolf, and human. <br /> <br />  Great characterization, impressive performances all around and high production values help \\"Underworld\\" live up to its full potential.  Horror fans, action fans (especially those inclined towards great, larger-than-life martial arts action), fantasyfans who don't mind their fiction dark and violent, and any fans of rip-roaring adventurous movies where the love angle isn't just a cool subplot but an essential focus, have Got to see this one, and especially to see this extended version.  Outstanding on all counts. <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Nothing here is what it seems.\\" <br /> <br />Science fiction just isn't what it used to be. Over the last couple decades, beginning a few years after George Lucas's Star Wars Trilogy came to a close, sci-fi started to get darker. With films like Blade Runner, Terminator, and Total Recall, dystopian or apocalyptic futures started to invade the genre, supplanting the romps and high-spirited adventuring styles of Buck Rogers and Luke Skywalker. More and more \\"darker\\" kinds of films like The Matrix, Minority Report and I, Robot became sci-fi staples, with space opera becoming an endangered species, even moreso with Lucas's new lifeless, awkward, lumbering \\"vision\\" of the Star Wars universe that was employed in the Prequel Trilogy. <br /> <br />Fortunately, space opera was still alive and kicking, in the form of a prematurely cancelled TV series from the mind of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel). FireFly launched in 2001, and after a series of idiotic scheduling decisions by Fox, the series was put to rest. However, a legion of fans and suprisingly high DVD sales caught the attention of the movie industry, and creator Whedon, not content to let his baby die, managed to get a movie in the works to finish the story that began on a small transport ship in the backwater of the 'verse. <br /> <br />And in 2005, we got Serenity, and a reminder of what made movies like Star Wars a joy in the first place. <br /> <br />Now, that doesn't mean that there's nothing dark about the movie; there are both laughs and cries aplenty here. The story of the faithless former soldier and current captain of the ship Serenity, Malcom Reynolds, and his ragtag crew certainly has its share of woe. His medic, Simon, Tam is a fugitive who is trying to keep his mentally unstable (and psychic) sister, River, from the watchful eyes of the totalitarian Alliance, which makes finding paying work (legal or otherwise) that much harder. His compatriots (some of whom qualify as friends) consist ofa brilliant and lovestruck mechanic, Kaylee; his former second-in-command, Zoe; her husband and resident idiot-savant pilot, \\"Wash\\"; Inara Senera the courtesan; Darial Book the preacher; and Jayne, a blue-collar killer who has the morals of a wolverine. Mal himself is a man who has lost his faith, and keeps fighting for survival simply to protect those he cares about. <br /> <br />And yet, these characters, troubled though they are at times, are what makes this tale so incredible, and despite its tragedy, so uplifting and joyous. The story of their battles against the Alliance, the cold-hearted Operative sent to hunt them down, and the vicious Reavers, crazed cannibals drifting on the edges of the black, is full of fast-paced action, witty banter, and real, full characters that provide such a great emotional anchor that you geniunely care about the entire world (or worlds) they live in. While Serenity has its share of interstellar scraps and old-fashioned shootouts, it is the way the characters resonate with the audience that really makes it feel magical. <br /> <br />With surprisingly skillfull camera work for a first-time movie director (thanks to help from technical veterans of movies like Mystic River), as well as more than a little help from David Newman's brilliant score, Serenity soars to new heights of the kind of emotion and entertainment that science fiction can offer. It's a tale of heroes and villains who are, in the end, just people; a story of sorrow, joy, victory, and belief. Nathan Fillion isn't Harrison Ford, and doesn't try to be (though he does a hell of a job of making his character shine), but like the original Star Wars, it's him, the actor and his co-workers and most importantly, their characters, that help Whedon's vision echo back to the glory of science fiction's past. <br /> <br />It's what happens when you truly reach for the stars.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This a great Hoilday movie, yeah it can be a bit sappy and fluffy at times...but it a hoilday movie. Will Ferrell just proves that he can do any role at all. I am not sure how many actor can pull this role off and keep Buddy likeable for over 2 hours. Ferrell pulls it off. I know that Jim Carrey and Chris Kattan were once consider for the role. Jim Carrey took another role and they thought Chris was to short for the role. I KNOW i would have hated this movie if Carrey was in it.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have no life. I am almost 30 years old and on Thursday nights I can't wait to sit down and watch as the lives of Ryan, Seth, Marissa, Summer, Julie, Sandy, Kirsten and the rest of the Newport elite unfold before my eyes. Maybe I am drawn to the show so that I can live vicariously through other people, but it doesn't matter. This is a show I don't miss.<br /><br />And even though I don't miss it, I found this DVD set to be fantastic, a welcome addition to a collection that is both eclectic and growing.<br /><br />Of course I never expected The O.C. to be as strong in the second season as it was in the first. After exploding on to the scene in its first season, there was sure to be a letdown and there was, but that doesn't change the fact that this is still an enjoyable television show with some great characters, solid writing and some good acting.<br /><br />The season opens where the first season left off (naturally) with Seth in Portland with Luke and his dad after sailing away in the season one finale. Ryan is back in Chino, living with Theresa, who is pregnant with their baby. Kirsten is knocked out by the departure of her two kids and has turned to the bottle a little more than normal. Sandy copes with her and the ongoing construction in the Cohen household. Marissa, with Ryan departing for Chino, has also hit the bottle and has been forced to live with her mother (Julie) and step-father (Caleb). Her father (Jimmy) is taking it easy on a boat with Kirsten's sister Hailey (Guest star Amanda Righetti) and Summer is still reeling from the departure of Seth and is trying to rid  herself of anything pertaining to him.<br /><br />Okay, now that we're caught up on where everyone is, it is time to talk about where everyone goes and in Season Two, some people certainly went places.<br /><br />Early on, Hailey took a job in Japan, jilting Jimmy, (Tate Donovan) who in a moment of desperation, proposes to her. Of course the Japan job was just a way to right Righetti out of the show so she could concentrate on the short-lived North Shore, which had debuted in the summer. Jimmy eventually also sailed away, which will be noted later.<br /><br />Theresa, noticing that Ryan (Ben McKenzie) seemed distant and basically still in love with Marissa (Mischa Barton), lied to him, telling him that she lost the baby and basically pushing him back to Newport and the Cohen's beach house. It becomes quickly obvious that she still has the baby, and this certainly can be a story line in season three and beyond. Preparing to return to Newport, Ryan, at Sandy's urging, goes to Portland to convince Seth (Adam Brody) to return and the two make a triumphant return to Newport Beach.<br /><br />Of course, Marissa and Summer (the delicious Rachel Bilson) are not immediately receptive of their two Knights in shining armor. Marissa has spent the summer drinking away the days and hooking up with the lawn boy, while Summer was devastated by Seth's departure and wants noting to do with him when he returns.<br /><br />Julie (Melinda Clarke) and Caleb's (Alan Dale) strange marriage continues to take even stranger turns, as Caleb is indicted and eventually is forced to reveal that he fathered a child with another woman while married to Kirsten's mother.<br /><br />And things continue to get interesting from there. Lindsay (Shannon Lucio), Caleb's illegitamite daughter, and Ryan begin dating before realizing just what the situation is with her father. The story line with Lindsay started out very strong, but fizzled out near the end, although it is questionable why she at least didn't come back for Caleb's funeral in the final episode. After all, he is her father.<br /><br />Summer moved on from Seth, meeting Zack, (Michael Cassidy) a water polo player who is interested in comics. Seth is torn between his friendship with Zack and his relationship with Summer. The triangle is a fantastic arc through the whole season and Cassidy, of the four new guest stars this season, lasted the longest and deservedly so. His Zack was someone you could root for, making it hard to hate him when he took Summer from Seth. The trio put together a graphic novel (Atomic County) and even pitched it to a couple reps with interesting results, including an all-out fight between Seth and Zack in a comic book store.<br /><br />Seth, with Summer seeking comfort with Zack, dated wild child Alex, a tattooed-club manager (Olivia Wilde). Alex was a great addition to the show for the time she was there, dating Seth and then eventually getting in a relationship with Marissa. The storyline with her was strong, like the LIndsay storyline, but eventually wore out. However, her club The Bait Shop, became a great set with bands playing in many different episodes.<br /><br />The Marissa and Alex relationship was only one of a few stories for Marissa. She also hooked up with DJ (Nicholas Gonzalez) her family's yard guy. That relationship pissed off Julie and eventually came to an end. The story line was never built strongly, and probably thankfully, as there became so many characters to focus on.<br /><br />Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) suffered through their toughest year of marriage yet, as they were both tempted by others outside of their union. Sandy's ex Rebecca (Kim Delaney) returned for a short arc and Kirsten found herself attracted to Carter (Billy Campbell) an editor assigned to the Newport Group's new magazine. His departure pushed her further toward the bottle and eventually into rehab as the season concluded.<br /><br />Julie found herself cheating on Caleb with her ex, Jimmy. When the two were caught by Marissa, Jimmy figured the best thing to do was to get out and he sailed to Hawaii, only to return in the finale and in the start of season three. Caleb, possibly one of the creepiest men on television, also caught Julie with another ex, Lance (Johnny Messner). Lance managed to show Newport more of Julie than they every imagined, with a porn tape from her past. Caleb filed for divorce, but a heart attack, his second of the season, did him in in the season's penultimate episode. Ironically, Julie had called him to the house to basically poison him, but couldn't bring herself to do it.<br /><br />Ryan's brother, Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) also gave Newport living a try after being released from jail. He brought not only trouble, but some good story lines as well, as he tried to mend his former ways. Getting high and hitting on Marissa changed everything between the three (Ryan, Marissa and Trey) and eventually led to the shocking final scene, as Marissa shoots Trey as he and Ryan fight.<br /><br />As I have said, I am addicted to this show, so I was bound to like this set. But the two commentary tracks added a good insight to the show, as did a good blooper reel, a feature on fashion and the Obsessed Completely special that ran prior to the start of the season.<br /><br />All in all, a fine effort.

B00005JO17|5.0|The digitally projected, polarized 3-D version is astonishing. The clearest, brightest image I have ever seen in a multiplex; this is truly the future. <br /> <br />The movie itself was a cute kid flick; if not as good as the best of Pixar, so what? The kids and adults in the audience seemed delighted with it. The venom against this film is mostly illogical; just enjoy the family film (in glorious digital 3-D) and forgot the comparisons to other movies.
B00005JOHU|3.0|\\"There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. <br />Thats one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. <br />The only question is:How do we arm the other 11?\\" <br /> Yuri Orlov(Nicholas cage) <br /> \\"Lord of WAR\\" <br /> A well intended semi-biophic designed to highlight the massive firearm trade business behind war.Nicholas Cage is given his best role in a long time as Yuri Orlov,an interesting performance as we are allowed relate to someone who makes his living from the deaths of others.Cage makes the most of his role,juggling business savvy confidence effectively with an underlying vulnerability.Someone who feels that hes essentially out of his debt.In the end we see a man who knows hes untouchable,but has lost everything that means anything to him.  <br /> The rest of the cast offer some delicious performances ,thanks to a script that offers surprisingly rich characters.Jared Leto is perhaps the most memorable as Orlovs troubled brother,the self proclaimed \\"f**k up\\" of the family.Ethan Hawke also appears as a narcotics officer in a brilliantly played small role. <br />The cinematography is to be admired,despite the fact that alot of it is hit or miss.Consider a hokey yet inventive opening bullet POV sequence and an exciting plane landing on the Sahara Desert.Both great in different ways. <br />Pic is never as powerful as it wants to be though,and perhaps the 1st person narrative is the cause of this,making the film feel more like an illustrated lecture at times.This dvd is certainly a must for Nicholas Cage fans and those looking for a fresh indifferent perspective on war.just dont expect it to be as effective as it could of been.
B000002UUX|5.0|In my teenage years, I mostly listened to metal; Megadeth was my favorite band, and Countdown to Extinction and Rust in Peace were my favorite albums.  And still, in 2005, Rust in Peace is one of my all time favorite albums, period.<br /><br />Picture an empty basement.  Saturday night, midnight.  Rikki Rachtman and his Tom Araya hairdo are welcoming a new viewer, a Motley Crue, GN'R, Poison fan to the show...<br /><br />...whoa!  Sensory overload!  Too much darkness, too much aggression, too much complexity to see!  But wait, our fan is starting to adjust, starting to adapt.  Hold on.  What is this?  A grinding, repetitive power chord intro... \\"Welcome to this fortress high, I'll take some time to show you `round.\\"  And some five minutes later, after a 3+ minute solo outro featuring the most possessed runs in metal history, a new metal fan was born.<br /><br />Rust in Peace transformed me from a music fan, to a student, analyzer, and critic of music.  And what does this critic have to say some 11 years after first hearing this album?<br /><br />Hot damn.<br /><br />Right out of the gate, this horse plunges forward at uncanny speed with \\"Holy Wars.\\"  This track sets the tone for the album.  The tone?  Riffs and rhythms that sound like solos, and solos that sound like the sonic representation of laser and deathray-based intergalactic warfare.  Seriously, if you want discipline, focus, and repetition in practice, personified, look no further than Dave Mustaine.  How in the world is this guy playing these verse riffs/solos while singing?  (Please suppress the desire to blurt out any vocal jokes at this time).<br /><br />Not satisfied?  Want more?  See Marty Friedman.  I mean, without a doubt, this was the most killer Megadeth line-up operating at the most absurd level of proficiency.  Each track displays a range of tempos, moods, breakdowns, and changes.  More importantly, the better described as compositions work so well as progressions of intent.  The politically, socially, and militarily charged songs seem to always be charging to a pre-destined vantage point, and it is this quality, even in the presence of such an abundance of solos, which gives Rust in Peace its cohesive and thematic strength.  I would go as far to say that this album is so balanced by intent and patience that it makes the oft-despised Mustaine vocals seem absolutely fitting.<br /><br />Aside from that criticism, and despite the almost endless 5 star ratings on Amazon, there are many who do not hear the appeal of this album.  I am at an utter loss to address those critics.  I have tried, and I cannot listen to this album from the perspective of a skeptic.  Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Sepultura...not a one of these great bands has released such a perfect blend of maniacal rage, relentless speed, and breathtaking skill.  Though Metallica must be given credit for their unparalleled, epic songwriting when epic and metal weren't really congruent terms, songs like \\"Take No Prisoners\\", \\"Eye of the Tornado\\" and \\"Rust in Peace\\" added a level of technicality and precision the metal world was not accustomed to.<br /><br />Here in 2005, one can still listen to this album and immediately forget its classic appeal and longevity.  Indeed, the musical performance and lyrical content place it well within any contemporary circles of metal, and probably, just as it did upon its release, more accurately places it ahead of anything being played today.itically, socially, and militarily charged songs seem to always be charging to a pre-destined vantage point, and it is this quality, even in the presence of such an abundance of solos, which gives Rust in Peace its cohesive and thematic strength.

B00097DXZS|4.0|Love Santana, love the album.  Favorite tracks are 10 (Cry Baby Cry featuring Sean Paul and Joss Stone, 11 (Brown Skin Girl featuring Bo Bice) and 12 (I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love featuring Los Lonely Boys), with Bice's Brown Skin Girl the catchiest and hardest to forget.  Keeps going around and around in your head all day.  It would make a great single.
B00005RG6B|4.0|Ok.  So if you're reading the reviews for Operation Livecrime, you're probably a fan.  As a fan, this is a must have DVD.  Plus, there are many reviews of the band and their songs.  I won't repeat their wonderful comments. <br /> <br />This DVD has a fairly-good 5.1 audio track; if you don't have a Dolby Digital 5.1 setup...you should just buy the CD.  I bought the DVD because I've got a really good 5.1 setup with a good-sized sub.  The 5.1 mix is very basic: Tate's vocals are out of the center speaker while the rest of the musicians are from the front (left/right).  The rear surround channels are almost invisible.  If you increase the volume of the surrounds, you'll hear faint crowd noise.  Obviously, having been recorded in the early 90s, they probably weren't anticipating a DVD 5.1 mix.  Although, I have heard many pre-DVD concerts successfully transferred into 5.1 with excellent instrument separation and crowd placement.  They could've done a much better job at re-mixing the soundtrack for 5.1.  I have both the DVD and the CD...if you don't have a good 5.1 setup at home...avoid this DVD - just buy the CD.   <br /> <br />Ok...the editing is mind-numbing.  I hate short cut segments.  There's not a single shot that's longer than 5 seconds; that's really annoying.  However, I can overlook the poor editing for a glimpse into a concert that I regrettably missed.  Operation Mindcrime is a very energetic, physically and mentally exhausting CD; I can understand why sometimes it's necessary to have fast cut scenes to emphasize the energy of the moment.  Probably doesn't need to be that fast cut through the whole film...but I'll forgive it.  For Queensryche fans everywhere, this is a must-have for the collection.  I hope when high definition DVDs finally make it to market, they'll redo both the audio and video.  Until then, this is a great substitute.  Beats the hell out of VHS and stereo! <br />
B0009H1CK6|5.0|Great show. Amazing musicians, excelent sound and image. The energy is contagious and even the Montreux audience, although somewhat shy, can't avoid getting involved. Rodgers is still on top of his game. His guitar was and still is the soul of Chic. The other members of the band are equally exceptional. Well done!!!
B00011CZRE|5.0|The movie is one of the best movies ever. Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman did it very well. The end of the movie is the best what i have seen.The Director is very talented and this movie is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Simple words can't describe this movie...
0895260131|5.0|As an european with a deep knowledge of the menace that islam has been for the  european civilization I can only say that this book destroys the veil of hypocrisy that the leftists all around he world and their not so hidden hacks and allies have cast upon the plain truth on this dangerous cult. <br /> <br />Europe survived several islamic invasions only thanks to the courage of the Francs of Charles Martel, thanks to the crusader warriors, thanks to the Maltese knights as well as thanks to the marvellous soldiers of the polish king Jan Sobieski, who saved Vienna and consequently entire Europe from the Turks no more than three and half  centuries ago. <br /> <br />When the Turks had alread succeded at imposed the presence of their symbol on the towers of Vienna. <br /> <br />Islam destroyed during its expansion the  ancient christianity  that was predating it in North Africa and in the Middle East, as it was in Persia, where it was the commonest religion. <br /> <br />It established an humiliating status of dhimmitude for the non moslem who refused to give up their land and religion to the pretences of the arab conquerors. <br /> <br />Rightly Spencer points out that dhimmi means not only protectd, but also guilty: christians and jews were guilty of not having accepted Mehemet, a road bandit at its beginning,  as the true prophet. <br /> <br />This system is still partly in use today, it is sufficient to be willing to listen to the tales of the surviving Coptic christians of Egypt, who are costantly set apart as outcasts in their own country, who are barred from public posts, humbled in many ways, when they are not openly  attacked because of  their religion. <br /> <br />The adorers of political correctness should listen to the tales of the Iraqui Christians, the real descendants of the ancient Assyrian people, whe were gradually and barbarically expropriated of most of their land by the arab invaders, whose last political incarnation was Saddam Hussein. <br /> <br/>But they will not, as they pursue their clear agenda of estirpating Christendom from the land inhabited by europeans, being the helping and abetting of the mass migration of millions of moslems one of their tools for the destruction of the white and christian Europe. <br /> <br />As a man who has witnessed the agressiveness of the islamic immigrants, who has heard them menacing bombs and destruction well before September 11, being them aware of teh french bombings of the mid nineties before they happened, I may only say that jihad has already been taken a foot on our soil: I can say that the secret aim of mass migration is the colonization and islamization of Europe and eventyually the world, since many of them brazenly tell it in our faces on many occasions. <br /> <br />This book for me is not an eye opener, but just a scholarly written tractate that cathegorizes in a deep, profund way what we already know.
B000B0WODA|5.0|I think that some reviewers SO expect a sophomore slump that they hear one anyway, even when there isn't one. Such is the case with FF here. This follow-up record isn't one iota worse than their debut. In many ways, it's more confident.  <br /> <br />Franz Ferdinand has a sound so distinct they could patent it. They rock and keep rockin'...and if you don't believe me, listen to just snippets of Evil and a Heathen, I'm Your Villain (the hooky bassline nicked from The Clash's Train in Vain...but improved upon!), You're The Reason I'm Leaving, and Outsiders. This group is fun to listen to it's like an illegal drug.  <br /> <br />Why not 5 stars then? Only, because it's VERY similar to their 1st effort, almost interchangeably so. For instance, the final song, Outsiders, is very similar to the final song on their first cd, 40'. They both employ melodicas at the end, I believe, and virtually the same tempo (still, they are both GREAT tunes!). I would have liked a little variation, development and maturity. I hope when they come back with album #3 they've added some new twists. In the meantime, this album is on high, heavy rotation. One of the best of the year!
B0002N4ZEW|3.0|Not a highly original concept, definitely a highly marketable one -- an LSD soundtrack (yawn).  Sampled Pink Floyd guitar riffs, how clever!  Turn down the dorm room lights, crank up the lava lamp, and voila!  Instant psychedelic voyage, just add...well, I'll leave that part up to you to figure out.<br /><br />Now that I've slagged it, I'll say that Porcupine Tree does this piece of music justice by carrying the prank all the way through.  This is no half-baked execution of their idea.  The songs range from 15-20 minutes each, are superbly recorded, and straddle a line between campy substance humor and furrowed-brow psuedo-science that is fun on quite a few different levels.<br /><br />A novelty record at worst, a tongue in cheek acid parody at best.  File along with Timothy Leary, Terrance McKenna, \\"Ogden's Nut Gone Flake,\\" \\"Altered States\\" with William Hurt, \\"Mountain Jam\\" by the Allman Bros. and maybe your Cypress Hill records (I know you have 'em!)  Don't take it too seriously or hold it in too much esteem and you won't be let down -- ahem -- I mean bummed out.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|I guess the judges felt that both Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn were overdue for an Oscar.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you saw this movie and didn't love it, go watch the DVDs of the TV series.  While the movie stands on it's own, it's kinda like watching a Star Trek movie if you'd never seen the series.  You get it, but there's a lot of history and character development you don't know that adds depth to the story.  The characters are very complex, and there's so much behind what appears on the surface to be only an action flick.  The depth of characters and quality of the writing and dialogue leaves any other SF movie I've ever seen (including all Star Wars and Star Trek movies, Matrix, etc.) in the dust.

B0002ZYE1Y|3.0|I highly anticipated this album and now after all this time that I own it I have to say that its not that much. 3 stars is the maximum that I give it and maybe too much <br /> <br /> My opinion is that maybe this is their worst album compared to all of the rest the only reason being that in terms of composing the songs are weak. Besides \\"ghost love score\\" which is one of the best songs they have written and \\"I wish I had an angel\\" and maybe \\"planet hell\\" and \\"dead gardens\\" the rest of the songs don't say much. They don't get my as much excited as listening to their previous albums and to me they sound as fill ins!! <br /> <br /> I don't mind the fact that they sound a bit more heavy and more straightforward, it could be a nice development through the years. <br /> I do mind though the bad and low production of the album.  <br />Compared to \\"OCEANBORN\\" for example its like comparing\\"the number of the beast\\" with Iron's last album!! <br /> <br /> When I listen to \\"oceanborn\\" i find no weak songs and they sound classic and fresh at they same time.  <br /> Even compared with the \\"angels fall first\\" album in terms of inspiration and composition the first sounds better to me!!! <br /> <br /> I do not object to people liking this album (even though I object to the highly overclaimed reviews that it received and my mind starts to spin around here). My only objection is that maybe some people here are prejudiced towards the band being a good fan. <br /> <br />There isn't much more to say only that I still listen to their first albums each one being a jewel but I can't listen to \\"once\\".
B000002AHM|5.0|Not only is this one of the most amazing technical shows of guitar skill I've ever heard, but it's also highly musical and exotic. You hear it straight from the first song. You hear the beautiful interplay between Paco and Al, and then it throttles you into one of these two sonofabitches solos, with an impecable rhythm backing it. And it goes on. And on. Throughout the whole album you are just amazed by the interplay between Paco and Al, John and Al, John and Paco, and all three of them together.
B00006D295|4.0|It's hard to believe that when THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW was first released in 1975, it was being shown as a regular feature with daytime shows.  I can hardly imagine this a Saturday matinee for even one week's time. <br /> <br />Thank goodness for Greenwich Village's WAVERLY THEATER that started the midnight cult phenomenon that has been legendary for 30 years.  This movie was actually partially responsible for making New York City theaters like THE WAVERLY and the 8TH STREET PLAYHOUSE famous. <br /> <br />So with a reputation like that, it would seem that ROCKY HORROR is damn near flawless.  But as a pure film, without the fun of the audience participation, that's not so.  The first half nearly jumps out of its socks with excitement and music.  By the time you're into the latter half, it has slowed to an almost comatose level.  Even the songs have lost their edge by then. <br /> <br />But for its flaws, it's timeless fun to be watched over and over again, even if it's only on your TV.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|Great to look at.  But in the end im a little disapointed.  Johnny Depp should not have been wily wonka but whatever.  ill stick to the origial. but it looks great.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Ten years after Green Day burst into the mainstream in 1994 with the hugely popular Dookie, they released American Idiot and were quickly reinstated at the top of the pop music charts after spending several years in relative obscurity.  Whether their new success was comprised of fair-weather fans or of a brand new crop ripe for pop-punk exposure, Green Day capitalized on this revitalization and became the voice for yet another generation of adolescents.  Even a year after its release, American Idiot was still as popular as ever with a continous stream of singles and music videos dominating the air waves one after another.  But the question remains: why did they become so popular again?  Was it the quality of the music?  The pointed political stance?  Or was it that they changed their image to fit in a world overcrowded with people dressed all in black and wearing too much eye liner?  Whatever the case, when listening to American Idiot, little difference can be found between this and their earlier works.  As per usual, all the songs present meet the Green Day prerequisites of catchiness, crunching guitars, and clever lyrics.  These standards happen to be where the problems lie: the album is over-reliant on Green Day's all too familiar strengths and as a result it's a lot less impressive than what it could have been.  While Billie Joe does manage to flex his songwriting muscle by examining the same set of characters for an entire album and adding his two longest songs to date, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming,\\" he is often found recycling the same rhyme schemes and vocabulary that he's used a thousand times before.  In addition, Billie Joe's thinly veiled \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" character is a ridiculously egotistical move that scarily borders between laughable and, given the current state of Green Day's influence, alarmingly true.  Musically, there is evidence of genre experimentation but these examples are too few and far between to make much of an impact in the constant guitar assault.  Although the guitar may be part of what makes the album gel so well, it also becomes a crutch when seemingly nothing better could be used in its place.  That's not to say that all these things make American Idiot weak or unworthy of a place in Green Day's lofty discography.  The Indian flourishes and beautiful pacing of \\"Extraordinary Girl,\\" the fantastic ending to \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" the classic rock n' roll tribute in \\"Homecoming,\\" and even the ambitious \\"rock opera\\" song structuring all rank among Green Day's finest moments.  A masterpiece?  Not quite, but it remains a fine example of Green Day's music and is a welcomed boost in popularity for a band that rightly deserves it.tant guitar assault.

B000000OQY|5.0|For me Lies is all about the acoustic side of the album. I don't think that I'm alone here. In the many years that I have owned this disc, I have only listened to the live side a handful of times, meanwhile the \\"B side\\" is an essential part to the collection.<br /><br />FOUR SONGS:<br /><br />PATIENCE, so different than anything on APPETITE. You can easily look at this in a couple of ways. A) AXL ROSE pussied out B) AXL ROSE was a genius in that he could do rippin' rock tracks AND songs to get the ladies unzipped, or C.) Who the hell is AXL ROSE? Either way this track was key in the catalouge of GN'R because it introduced the softer side of the band... this would be very important in their future success.<br /><br />USED TO LOVE HER, If you are the biggest, dirtiest band around and you release an acoustic disc, you have to do something to make sur integrity is held. This song does that perfectly. A light riff with words about killing your chick and literally burying her in the back yard. Yes.<br /><br />YOURE CRAZY, shows that GN'R almost invented the concept of UNPLUGGED. They took one of their nastiest electric tunes and rehashed it into a still pretty nasty acoustic track. My personal choice for this pack.<br /><br />ONE IN A MILLION, well, I ain't no racist ok? Maybe I'm just a regular white boy trying to make ends meat. Still, I've always liked this song due to the fact that there are so many  questionable lyrics, digging at all races, the police, homosexuals etc. No way would he get away with releasing this today. This song is like he was just proving that this band was the biggest thing in the world and that he could say ANYTHING and get away with it. Classic.<br /><br />The live tracks ARE ok, but they are nothing legendary. This is all together a nice little package for any GNR fan. There really isn't to much in the catalouge- so, if you don't have THIS one then you are missing a lot.
B00004XQP4|5.0|On Nimrod, Green Day started to experiment with their sound and go beyond the simple parameters of pop punk.  With the release of Warning, Green Day fulfill their promise of musical exploration and deliver their most compelling and fascinating album yet.  Right from the start, the title track shows a side of Green Day that's never been heard before: the smart acoustic guitar, the excellent use of the twangy electric guitar on the bridge, and the various sirens and sound effects let the listener know they're in for a different kind of Green Day album.  The best example of their new direction shows on \\"Misery,\\" a six-minute tour-de-force of several musical styles and instruments, from the French accordian to the Latin guitar and horns, all wrapped up in a brilliant character exercise from Billie Joe Armstrong.  Despite this brave new experimentalism, the album is still chock full of great pop songs like the catchy single \\"Minority,\\" the rolling rhythms of the poingant \\"Church on Sunday,\\" the wonderfully Kinks-ian \\"Jackass,\\" and the more serious take on dominatrix love (as compared to the hilarious \\"Dominated Love Slave\\" from Kerplunk) on \\"Blood, Sex and Booze.\\"  To finish things up, Green Day closes out the album with two of their most affecting songs yet, the yearning \\"Waiting\\" and the somber \\"Macy's Day Parade,\\" which work as perfect closers to a more mature and meditative disc.  The conciseness, the brilliant writing, and the seemless blend of ideas makes Warning Green Day's best album since Dookie and shows just how much this talented band is capable of producing in the future.
B00005ATQH|4.0|Stanley Kubrick of the early sixties made some HILLARIOUS black comedies. See also DR. STRANGELOVE. This is a fun movie loosely based on a very controversial book of the day LOLITA. The story about a proffesor who becomes obsessed with a twelve year old girl.<br /><br />I have never read the book, but understand that the movie very loosely follows the plot. I have also never seen the 1998 remake with Jeremy Irons. I don't know if it would match this one.<br /><br />Kubricks direction is always legendary, and the acting here is top notch. Shirley Winters is no doubt the most obnoxious, clingy chick EVER! I no doubt would have shot her a thousand times if she was my wife. However, it is all very comical here.<br /><br />\\"oh HUM, everytime you touch me I go limp all over!\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, I know the feeling.\\"<br /><br />Classic dialouge in this peice. However there are certain things that are sort of brushed over. LIKE, we never actually SAY that lolita is only twelve years old. You as a fan of the book were already expected to know this. Also the relationship between HUM and LOLITA is never potrayed as sexual, just implied. These were some clever techniques to get this movie released back in 1962.<br /><br />PETER SELLERS is brilliant as always as his character QUILTY, another man obsessed with the little girl. Only he is a much cooler dude.<br /><br />I think it would be a good idea to read this book to get a better understanding of the depth of the plot. I plan to eventually. Here though, we get a very interesting series of events, and some very funny moments in a clever and quirky film.<br /><br />The campy sixties theme song by The Ventures also works for me.<br /><br />\\"So what was the deciding factor?\\"<br /><br />\\"I think it was your cherry pies.\\"
B000BW7QX6|1.0|Don't believe the people that are giving 5 stars to this horrible movie. This is an overrated film. If you look browse movie websites you will see that this movie has good reviews yet didn't make enough money in theaters. The reason why is because this movie is really horrible and most people decided to ignore this movie completely. <br /> <br />I made the mistake of seeing this movie because of the constant overrated score it received in numerous websites. Don't be intrigued to see this movie. <br /> <br />About Serenity: <br />I don't even know where to start about how pathetic this film is! I have never even thought about walking out of cinemas due to bad quality of films until I watched this joke of a movie. <br /> <br />It's forgettable. <br />It's non-dramatic.  <br />It's unappealing.  <br />Predictable storyline. <br /> <br />The movie is based about a Han Solo wannabe called Capt. Malcolm Reynolds and his crew who rescue a girl named River. This girl apparently as result of her captivity from the future government called \\"Interplanetary Alliance \\"developed unbelievable combat skills and telepathic abilities.  She has some secrets the government doesn't want everyone to know. But sense they rescued the girl, you know it; the crew struggles for their survival and to keep this girl from government hands. So now that you know the whole story of this movie, get ready for the bad CGI chases, lame jokes, and River using her Kung Fu fighting skills against people four times her size (the only thing missing while she was fighting was having the \\"everybody's kung-fu fighting\\" song and Luke Skywalker greeting Han Solo wannabe). <br /> <br />Don't say I didn't warn you if you buy this movie. Avoid this DVD like the plague.
B000002U8G|5.0|I have just never understood how someone could not like PINK FLOYD, especially in their early seventies hey days. These guys produced records with such passion and presiceness and created such full bodied atmospheric sounds you can't help but get taken in by it.<br /><br />Close your eyes and listen to albums like this one MEDDLE in its entirety and you are going on a trip. You don't really even need drugs to get stoned to this album.<br /><br />This one was released in 1972, one year before DARK SIDE catapulted them into the point of no return successes. What this means is that the band was still functioning as a unit and were still daring to try brave experimental peices.<br /><br />ECHOES is a 23 minute journey into your own brain. It dazzles and mystifies, its creepy and cool. This track was originally all of side two onthe record. Don't be afraid of its length, you will forget about time once you are in.<br /><br />Side One is the most ecclectic Floyd set you will ever find anywhere- yet is all very great. My favorite FLOYD set, to be exact. ONE OF THESE DAYS is a bass heavy riffer that will melt your face for sure, there is NO WAY they could have opened this one better, this flows into the dreamy PILLOW OF WINDS and on from there into FEARLESS, a definate pleaser.<br /><br />After that we get SAN TROPEZ, I find this song to be cool simply because of its uncharacteristic light heartedness. This is Roger Waters singing here, the same guy that in a few years would pen \\"The worms ate into his brain\\" is singing \\"as I reach for a peach...\\" I love it.<br /><br />Anyway we close with SEAMUS (thats the dog) a strange bluesy song with a dog. Check out the movie POMPEII, there you actually witness David Gilmoure \\"playing\\" the dog like an instrument. Weird.<br /><br />All around one of my fave FLOYD discs. It is the closest thing to the feel of DARK SIDE. I would have reccomended this to myself back in the day when I was jonesin for a DARK SIDE companion. All other FLOYD travels in its own path, some more trippy, or spacey, or commercialized, or just way the F out there.<br /><br />The years between 72- and 74 were the absolute best years in FLOYDS career. Tight laced and free. Also check out OBSCURRED BY CLOUDS., some more trippy, or spacey, or commercialized, or just way the F out there. <br />The years between 72- and 74 were the absolute best years in FLOYDS career.

B000AARKOO|2.0|Lets go see this movie because Orlando Blooms in it! <br /> <br />Please Hollywood. This movie is so off it's not even funny. They do everything they can not to offend anyone. Blooms character would be seen as an infidel. He also does not become a great fighter after 5 minutes of lessons from his father. He says he has no religion, so why even go to Jerusalem?  <br /> <br />A fiction movie to attract Orlando Bloom fans all for the $$$$$. It's not bad but it's not accurate either. It takes place long ago with todays politically correct thoughts. Stick with the History Channels look at the Crusades for educating. Watch this to be entertained.
B0009UC810|5.0|No, do not settle for BLUES BROTHERS 2000, its all about the original 1980 movie with John Belushi and Dan Akroyd. I'll get back to this point....<br /><br />You NEED this movie. It is chock full of COOL. One of the most rockin' movies that was ever made.<br /><br />Cab Calloway's character is the king sh*t for sure, and he just gets coooler as the movie goes on.<br /><br />The plot is rockin', the action is top notch (the police car chase scene at the end was one of the most innovative movie tricks of its day; the police car chase scene at the beggining is almost as good.)<br /><br />Music from many old school blues greats, at the top of their game in this picture. RAY CHARLES; JAMES BROWN; JOHN LEE HOOKER, just to name a few. I also have always been impressed at how sexy ARETHA FRANKLIN is as the waitress. It ain't everyday you hear me call Aretha Franklin sexy, trust me. But in this movie that chick is rockin!<br /><br />Carrie Fischer is one smokin' chick herself, and her role is perfect as the pissed off ex love out for blood.<br /><br />I believe this movie was a labor of love for everyone involved in it. And in turn we are graced with a hip flick that is always a pleasure to watch. YUP, you definatley should go ahead and BUY this for everyone you know that is cool.<br /><br />BLUES BROTHERS 2000 no. They tried, but failed to make the cut. It was too different, and to many of the stars were dead or too old when this one finally got made. Sorry John Goodman, I mean no disrespect, I just didn't care for the part.

B000002OZY|2.0|Tommy(1969). The Who's Fifth Album.<br /><br />In 1969, The Who were close to becoming international superstars. While they had achieved minor sucess in America, The Who still didn't have a best-selling album yet. In 1969, to create hype for Tommy, The Who released \\"Pinball Wizard\\" as a single. The song became The Who's best-selling single yet, and people went out in droves to buy Tommy. Tommy was highly hyped by critics and fans alike who were calling the album a \\"rock opera\\". The album was a critical and commercial smash, and The Who were grouped along with bands like Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles. Pete Townshend's story of a deaf, dumb, and blind pinball player might have been an unlikely sucess, but it helped make The Who to become one of rock's most recognizable bands. What did I think of this legendary album? Read on to find out!<br /><br />HISTORY<br /><br />With Tommy, The Who and Pete Townshend took a totally different approach to their new album. The Who was essentially a basic, catchy, and guitar-driven British group, but Pete Townshend strived to be something more than that. He wanted The Who to be a band that wouldn't just be remembered as musicians, but artists. After brainstorming many ideas off the rest of the group, Townshend finally patched up all the loose ends and contrived a massive concept album based on a boy who was deaf, dumb, and blind. The Who's record label and producer were skeptical at first, but they agreed to make the album.<br /><br />MUSIC<br /><br />Pete Townshend planned Tommy as a concept album, or an album where all the songs would \\"flow\\" or \\"blend together\\". Throughout Tommy, The Who repeats many of the same rhythms, melodies, and harmonies, and you will continually hear many of the same songs on each track. Pete Townshend tried to make his guitar not just an instrument, but a character in the story. To that degree, Tommy is a very ambitious album,  yet maybe it's own ambition is what causes it to fail.<br /><br /> \\"Pinball Wizard\\", a rock classic, is a thundering anthem that combines Pete Townshend's awe-inspiring guitarwork with Roger Daltrey's inspired singing. \\"I'm Free\\" is a short but sweet rocker that many fans will recognize as classic Who material. \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", the album's closer, is a decent track that finds The Who rocking out. The rest of the album, at best, is barely listenable. The tracks, which supposedly are chapters in the story, all sound the same. In fact, most tracks on Tommy are filler. What I found that I didn't like about this album is the overblown and cheesy way Tommy is made; the tracks are laughable at many times. While The Who tried to make an amazing rock opera, they simply did not suceed. Tommy is a hopelessly flawed and indulgent rock relic that will leave you feeling confused, but not satisfied.<br /><br />OPINION<br /><br />The Who would later go on to create masterpieces like Who's Next and The Who By Numbers, and Tommy inspired The Who to explore their creative abilities. Tommy also popularized The Who, and opened them up to a wider audience. \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"I'm Free\\" are also some of the finest Who tracks around. To me, Tommy had some good things, but mostly it was a disaster. However, many fans and rock critics consider Tommy a great album, and many, such as myself highly, dislike it. If I were to totally not recommend this album, I would be wrong. You might love Tommy, and you might not. I would suggest listening to Tommy or borrow it before you choose to buy it. If you wanted to discover The Who, I suggest picking up Who's Next, The Who By Numbers, or The Ultimate Collection to start you off.<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!fail. <br /> <br /> \\"Pinball Wizard\\", a rock classic, is a thundering anthem that combines Pete Townshend's awe-inspiring guitarwork with Roger Daltrey's inspired singing. \\"I'm Free\\" is a short but sweet rocker that many fans will recognize as classic Who material. \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", the album's closer, is a decent track that finds The Who rocking out.

0307236722|5.0|I bought the book because I really trust Martha Stewart to provide excellent instructions, yummy recipes and all the tools and skills to perfect a dish.  I was not dissapointed with the Baking Handbook!   <br /> <br />The recipes are well written, accurate and expertly described.  The photographs are beautiful and really give you the \\"ideal\\" to reach for. <br /> <br />Bravo Martha...Bravo!
B0009353IW|5.0|I've been a Ry Cooder fan since 1970, when I was in high school and his first album came out.  With Van Dyke Parks and Randy Newman, Ry defined 1970s Warner Bros. LA hip.  <br /> <br />My kids say I'm a curmudgeon, but I hate Buena Vista (I've been a big Cuban music fan, but other than Bruca Managua, I thought the cuts were really boring).  I had some trepidation buying this album, particularly as it was so overtly political <br /> <br />My fears were groundless.  For anyone who grew up in LA in the 50s/60s, it will bring back your childhood (Ry's liner notes are very accurate -- west was the future; east was the past).  For everyone else, the sheer musicality of this album equals Paradise and Lunch and Chicken Skin Music (my two favorite albums).  It has everything -- Willy G, Bla Pahinui, David Hidalgo,  Lalo Guerrero and a ton of other great musicians. <br />My favorite cuts are Poor Man's Shangri-La (now THAT'S  pure Ry   -- a lot like \\"Do You Want My Job\\" from Little Village); Onda Callejera, and the amazing vocals of a 90 plus year old Lalo and an astonishing sax on Chucos Suaves. <br /> <br />Buy this album!  It pretty much restored my faith in the music business and reminded me of being 10 and listening to the \\"X\\" late at night. <br /> <br />p.s.: I went to Loyola Law School and I never realized what a tool Fritz Burns was!
B00005JO17|5.0|I saw \\"Chicken Little\\" on Friday and am amazed how cynical some folks are about this movie, including Ebert and Roper.  This is a cute movie with a lot of laughs IF you go to it to be entertained, not to critique.  I'd say this film is more in line \\"The Incredibles\\" in terms of violence and cruelty than \\"Finding Nemo.\\" If your kids can handle that movie, they'll be able to handle this one.  Finally, don't leave too soon, I chair-danced my way through the start of the end credits.  Have fun!
B000001G1E|5.0|They say Elvis Presley is the \\"king\\" ,,,but can Elvis get superbad like James Brown? Can he Dance half as good? Did Elvis work as hard. Elvis couldnt do 8 or 9 minute dance marathons. <br />Whatever the consensus is...James Brown is a legend. All the new rap and dance and hip hop cant hold a candle to the energy and spirit James transmitted through the microphone. I always get energy when I listen to the Star Time Box Set.  It is definately worth the money you spend. All his best songs are extended to original length,,the way it should be. I cannot dis any of his music, he is just that good. His highlight years were 1968-72. <br /> He really worked hard, you can tell just by listening. His music doesnt grow stale because it is so dynamic and real. In any case dont waste time reading the reviews if you dont have the box set..... go and buy, it's worth it.. trust me.
B00005JXY3|3.0|Part II picks up where the first one left off.  Daniel has triumphed over the bullies of the Cobra Kai dojo, and finished high school.  Mr. Miaghi has gotten word that his father in Okinawa is dying, so he and Daniel rush off to Asia to be at his side.  While there Miaghi is confronted by a former friend / bitter enemy, revisiting a love triangle, and resolving a feud he left years ago.  Daniel meets up with his own conflicts: creating an enemy (who just happens to be the nephew of Miaghi's enemy, Sato), meeting his own next love in a semi-triangle (who just happens to be the neice of Miaghi's lost love), and resolving his own feud.   <br /> <br />This was just a little too predictable this time around.  Miaghi and Daniel being in parallel planes was a little too ridiculous, and the resolution between Miaghi and Sato was known from the beginning.  The pace of the movie was a little too slow, Daniel didn't ease up with his Jersey smart guy routine as we'd hoped he would from the first, and the final conflict was both predictable and cheesey.  It boardered on campy quite frankly.   <br /> <br />But, there are some good messages still in this movie.  It reinforced the important relationship between teacher and student, showed that it's important to have inner strength over muscle strength, and of course, the conflict and ultimate triumph of good over evil.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This is one of the defining albums from NIN, and the one that keeps  coming back into my CD player all the time. <br /> <br />Just a couple of comments on the other reviews: <br />Its an EP not an album - thats why its short ;-) <br />Physical is a cover of an Adam Ant song - so thats why it sounds a bit different from the other stuff, its the only non-original ;-) <br /> <br />A great heavy album that is fantastic live as well

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I heard about this show after the release of Serenity. I thought it might be fun to check it out through Netflix. The first dvd arrived, and I watched the pilot episode...and I felt like I had nine new friends. The cast, the writing, the whole concept is just so unique and so amazingly good. <br /> <br />How can a  Sci-Fi, Western, Comedy, Morality Tale Space show possibly work? Because of a very dedicated man and his crew of equally dedicated actors, directors, writers, set designers, etc. who all were able to see Joss Whedon's vision of this here 'Verse. After renting the first 3 dvds in the set, I knew I had to own it. I also knew that I would be morally obliged to convert as many friends and family to it as possible. <br /> <br />I simply can't tell you how much I love this show. Since discovering it, I have been thinking about it constantly. Where will Captain Tightpants and his crew take us next? I don't know. I just hope I can come along for the ride.
B00003CX9E|1.0|Are you kidding me?  I cannot believe that so many people are giving this more than 1 star.Why are there so many people that support such a lousy and boring film? Is it because they like to look deep and smart? It is truly sad that anyone would feel this way.

I bought both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. And it was simplly wonderful to have such a classic to comfort me, while being surrounded by another culture and language.<br /><br />This is a romance story, but for me, though I am a die-hard romantic, I have fallen in love with the prose, and romance of the age, not the actual romances between the characters.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|Finding Neverland is a wonderful, lovely little film.  It's about as perfect as they get.  The writers could have made it go on and on, bloating it past it's just over an hour and a half time frame.  But they didn't.  With amazing actors Johnny Depp, Kate Winslett, and Dustin Hoffman, the director could have let the cameras linger longer, stargazing to the point of watering down the story.  But he didn't.<br /><br />Finding Neverland tells the story of how the enduring story of Peter Pan came to be.  Johnny Depp plays Scottish playwright Sir James M. Barrie.  Barrie is just coming off a flop of a play that theater manager Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) underrwrote.  Kate Winslett plays a young widowed mother named Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. She is struggling to raise four boys.  The boys become the inspiration for Barrie's play.  Unfortunately, the story comes at personal cost to Barrie's wife Mary, and Sylvia.<br /><br />Like Johnny Depp, who got comparisons to Michael Jackson in his portrayal of Willy Wonka, Barrie is drawing ire from the Victorian folks as they question not only what is a married man doing spending so much time with a young widow, but what is he doing with four young boys? Mary is neglected as James spends hours playing games with the boys, or walking in the park with Sylvia. Sylvia is socially ostracized, causing her mother to become enraged with Barrie.  She accuses Barrie of being selfish.  There is no doubt that is true.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough that the brilliance and genuine qualities of all the children who acted in this film made this movie.  The looks of sheer delight on their faces as they watched the play looked like pure innocence.<br /><br />Extras include absolutely hilarious outtakes, a short piece on the creation of the movie, where Depp, Winslett, and Hoffman are interviewed, and an even shorter piece on the special effects used in the film.<br /><br />This is a film worth purchasing, as you will want to see it repeated times.  LIke a fine wine, it will ripen each time you see it, with new layers and nuances unfolding, until - one day - you will fall into tears.repeated times.

B00007AJF8|3.0|Too many inside jokes, too much Hollywood backslapping.  Movies about movie stars, books about authors and songs about rock and roll bands are just too onanistic.  I'm giving it three stars only because of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors.<br /><br />Also, the absurdist mode doesn't work well for feature-length movies.  Once the initial interest in the absurdity has worn off, there's really not much to go on.  That's why movies that do use the absurdist mode generally are divided into short segments, such as \\"Monty Python's Holy Grail\\" or \\"History of the World Part I.\\"

6305648522|5.0|The original version of Cinema Paradiso is a delightful film of love, coming of age, and unforgettable characters engaged in real life.<br /><br />At the end of the new uncut version, a famous, middle-aged Italian film director returns to the poor, dusty Sicilian town where he grew up. He comes back for the funeral of his oldest and best friend, the projectionist at the local cinema.<br /><br />There he rediscovers the love of his life. As teenagers they were tragically separated, neither knowing where the other had gone. Elena's parents had taken her to Tuscany, Salvatore had gone to Rome to work in the film industry.<br /><br />As the story unfolds and Salvatore realizes what happened and the part his old friend had in the separation, he says \\"Damn him!\\"<br /><br />Elena replies, \\"No, if we had stayed, you never would have made your movies, and that would be a shame. They are wonderful. I've seen every one.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't hate him. Somehow he knew that you had another life ahead.\\"<br /><br />It has all the elements of classic Italian tragedy. Star-crossed lovers, separated forever because of destiny.<br /><br />A great movie!

If you tend to avoid the grittier thoughts that we all have, and focus only on the pretty side of your mind this is not the book, or the author for you. CP uses disturbing description of sex, biology, and alimentary function as a tool to make the reader see that the main character lives in a world that we avoid.  <br />yes, it's wierd. Yes, it's graphic. even so, I dare you (as does CP, on the first page) to put it down. It's worth every churn of the stomach just for the twist at the end.
B000AGTPUA|2.0|Zemeckis and this NEW SCAM should be held accoountable to customers that purchase this FAKE OLD FASHIONED 50'S STYLE 3-D TOTAL GARBAGE!    BUYER BEWARE!!!  This IS NOT ANY GOOD 3-D AT ALL!!!  This is the OLD red & blue GARBAGE they use back in the 1950's.    Zemeckis and the company that released this version should be ashamed and made to give REFUNDS TO ALL that GOT SCAMMED and bought this GARBAGE 3-D version of this film.    I seen this movie in IMAX 3-D and it was the absolute best 3-D production (still to this day) ever made.    To not at least give us the current style 3-D that Disney Digital 3-D can bring veiwing audiences, is a total shame and I feel I GOT RIPPED OFF!!    As the first rewiew, when my wife and I seen this was being available in #0D we were estatic.  Bring it home to find out it's THE WORST 3-D FOR ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN!  Even the campy 50's 3-D's were better.  This 3-D has DOUBLE IMAGE and aggrivated our eyes (and even a couple of friends we wanted to show how BAD THE 3-D on this DVD is) within 10mins. of viweing.    I tried EVERYTHING to adjust by contrast, brightness, colors, interlance, progressive, movie mode, etc., EVERYTHING, and nothing would improve the quality of this HORRIBLE 3-D DVD release.    It is a total DISGRACE and Zemeckis & Company SHOULD REFUND ALL BUYER'S MONEY!    With the IMAX 3-D sequential this should have been released in, or at least a Digital 3-D.     In my opinion THIS DVD IS A SCAM FOR THOSE WISHING TO VIEW IT AGAIN FINALLY AT HOME IN 3-D.
B00005KFUN|5.0|I am ashamed to say that I have never heard of this band until I saw the movie \\"High Tension\\". After finishing the movie I waited for the credits to find out who the hell played the awesome theme of the movie... It was \\"Newborn\\" by Muse. I found this album and was amazed that EVERY track was just as if not more epic then than the first. They are a truly amazing band and I can't wait to get my hands on the previous and current releases. If you are a fan of Radiohead's less poppy tracks than you'll dig these guys. Not to say these guys are a rip off band but like all music you will find similar sounding bands... but this is not a Pearl Jam/Creed comparison. For all those that haven't heard this album you are really missing out.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|OK, here's how it all started for me. About a month ago in the Kansas City Star, I read a review of this interesting-looking movie I'd seen previews to called SERENITY. (\\"How cool to see a sci-fi movie with a title named after our ultimate goal in my N.A. group,\\" I thought.) The guy reviewing the movie is GUSHING over it, admitting out loud it's hard for him to give a completely unbiased review of the movie, since he's a die-hard fan of the TV series it was based on. Up to this point, I'd only heard the title \\"Firefly\\" bandied about on occasion...seeing it in TV Guide, hearing the occasional reference to it in my chat room, etc. About the only TV I watch on a regular basis are the classic series that are found on both HBO and FX--the other channels held little if any interest for me. So, after reading the KC Star reviewer ranting about the Firefly series, implying it was the sci-fi equivalent of the Second Coming of Christ, I thought I'd put it on my Netflix list and check it out. I remember thinking, \\"Well, if it's as good as STAR TREK and STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, I'll be impressed.<br /><br />God, was I ever impressed.<br /><br />The TV series box set all arrived in the space of one week, and I ended up watching them all in the space of 4 days. I couldn't put one disc in and just watch one episode...I was fished in like a spawning trout and had to watch the entire thing, start to finish. Hooked, hooked, HOOKED. I loved everything about this show from the get-go. The cast: It was cool to see the familiar faces of Ron Glass and Adam Baldwin, but even cooler to get acquainted with the others who were unfamiliar to me. 9 very, very gifted actors who, for all intents & purposes, appeared BORN to play these roles. I could rant about them all individually, but I'd be sitting here for another hour. You get the message. The acting: Matter of opinion here, but I think they pulled it off effortlessly. They BECAME their characters in the fashion of true method actors. When actors make their jobs look completely natural and effortless, they are achieving their goals magna cum laude. The stories: They pull you in immediately, the same way Stephen King and others like him pull you in right from the first few pages instead of taking forever with plot set-up and character study. Some of the more cynical among us would argue that the stories got a bit corny on occasion. To that I would argue, hey, even the best sci-fi TV shows and movies would occasionally tread into that territory (I have yet to forgive the NEXT GENERATION series for coming up with the episode where Data tried to become a stand-up comedian with the help of Joe Piscopo...or in the original STAR TREK where they took on the group of outer-space \\"hippies\\"...) Sometimes corniness can be the right kind of comic relief at the right time within a story; whether it works or not is subject to anyone's opinion. Personally, I don't think they ever crossed the line where that was concerned. The humor in the stories was a godsend, and the vast majority of the time, very well-done and thought out...and as I stated in my review of the movie, it was even more pronounced throughout the movie.<br /><br />I could go on about other nuances of the series that grabbed me or tell you about my favorite episodes, but after 1835 previous reviews of this series, you've gotten the message. Allow me to share this with you, though: After spending 4 days last week watching the series non-stop on DVD, I was chomping at the bit to go see the movie. I checked the newspapers to see if it was still showing anywhere here, since it had been playing for about a month at the time. Thankfully, it was still showing at ONE THEATRE quite a distance from where I live, and it goes without saying that it was worth the time, distance & $$ to get to see a truly fantastic movie. (Thank YOU, Joss.) It was the 7:30 showing that evening, and just imagine my surprise when I walked into the theatre to find it nearly PACKED. I thought I'd actually walked into the Friday night premiere of JARHEAD or something. Walked up to the top row, found a seat and asked the girl next to me if this was the theatre for SERENITY, & she said it was. No way in hell was I expecting to see that many people in the theatre that night, considering the movie was on its last run before (hopefully) hitting the dollar houses. Hard to describe the feeling that went through me as the lights went down and the movie started up...\\"corny\\" as this might sound to some, there was a real feeling of camaraderie, of family...like I was part of a large group of like-minded people of greater-than-average intelligence who know quality when they see it. I'm sure I don't have to tell any of you by now what a rush the movie was, or how it's one of the few movies I've seen in recent memory that I would pay to see again.<br /><br />As has been stated by other reviewers, we can hope that the suits at Fox have learned a lesson by pulling the plug on a series that deserved to survive. (Can't help wondering if the FX network might learn a similar lesson now that I've heard that OVER THERE has been cancelled...) I'd like to believe that this series will be remembered for ages to come for its quality, its humor, its depth, its humanity. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and I feel blessed to be a part of the Firefly/Serenity community.ly PACKED.

0007105673|5.0|I think A Suitable Boy is one of the most marvellous books ever written.  The characters breathe life from every page.  I wish, quite honestly, that there were double the number of pages in this book.  Except not, perhaps, in one volume... Then we really would strain our wrists.   <br /> <br />Seth's writing style varies from the serious to the playful and often reminds me of the styles of Tolstoy and Galsworthy (two more of the very small group of novelists who have, in my view, successfully interweaved social comedy and tragedy with politics).   <br /> <br />I have read several reviews in which people have expressed disappointment with the ending, and I can understand this.  At the same time, it is virtually impossible to end a saga (unless in death of the entire family ala Gabriel Garcia Marquez!)  I'm sure that Seth's ending reflects this very problem.  It's slightly wistful, possibly in acknowledgement of our desire to know more about what \\"happens\\" - and his inability to go on for ever! <br /> <br />A compulsive read.  Buy it. <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|I don't find anything wrong with this album or any of their first 4! So, listen to the samples (short though they be)! Buy this classic if ye feel so inclined! However, for some people let us clear up exactly why Cliff Burton was so awesome for the majority of fans of the \\"classic\\" Metallica: he helped in composing, as evidenced in the listed names under each song title in the liner notes, and was a major contributing component to their \\"classic\\" style!
B0000262I4|5.0|When Renata Scotto first sang Norma at the Met, she was humiliated by raving Maria Callas fanatics. Even so, that did not stop her from singing in this studio recording under the baton of James Levine who championed her and the obscure tenor Giuseppe Giancomini and celebraeted mezzo Tatiana Troyanos. The real strength lies in the way that Scotto and Troyanos, with their musically resplendent voices blend together in duets and scenas. They truly understand the relationship between Norma and her rival Adalgisa. Too bad Placido Domingo wasn't contracted to sing Pellione opposite Renata Scotto. They tended to sound great and they had already worked together in studio recording for Tosca. Fans of Callas disliked Scotto because they claimed her technique was almost a replica of Callas' voice. This is not true. Scotto had a unique voice whose vibrato and dramatic phrasing was entirely her own, even if influenced by Callas. And besides, what singer hasn't listened to Callas and tried in some way to emulate her ? Renee Fleming claims to model herself after Callas (eventhough their voices are entirely different) mezzo soprano and later soprano Shirley Verrett was a huge admirer of Callas and attempted to copy her in some ways and in recent years the most Callas-like soprano is Angela Gheorghiu. This Norma is well-conducted by Levine who treats the score with brilliant technical masteship of bel canto as dramatic theater. He had previously recorded Norma in 1974 with Beverly Sills as Norma and Shirley Verrett as Adalgisa. If this recording saw the light of day, when will that one ever make it to the recording market ? I can't wait till Deutsche Grammophone releases it! Please please release it! Beverly Sills, like Scotto, was a different Norma, one Norma who had a more beautiful, feminine tone instead of the huge, overdramatic style that most sopranos sing. Norma, for all her stature, was a woman with the most basic human emotions - love, motherhood, jealousy, anger, hatred, etc. Ideally, a coloratura soprano with dramatic or spinto capability should sing her. Very few singers have come close to the ideal Norma but I can honestly say that Maria Callas, Montserrat Caballe, Renata Scotto and Bevely Sills are the closest to perfect Norma on recording and stage performance. If Leontyne Price had sung Norma, she would have also nailed the role. One review mentions Renee Fleming. NEVER! She sings \\"Casta Diva\\" in concert and in recording albums with beautiful tone and ravishing pianissimi but that's it. She doesn' have the je ne sai quais to essay all the other arias. Should Fleming sing Norma, it would ruin her voice and she knows it. It would be a performance closer to Beverly Sills' Norma for both Fleming and Sills possess light instruments. Fleming stays away from the dramatic roles because it would cut her career short. She will never sing Tosca, Turandot, Norma, or even Butterfly. Perhaps the closest to a dramatic role she has sung is the heroine in I Pirata the bel canto rarity.
B000002HMH|2.0|ho-hum. just O.K. nothing new or special. that's why i have a problem with it. it bores me. it's fine for playing at work as background music that coworkers might like, but that's about it.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Close your eyes for a few seconds and forget Batman Baegins.  It's the best live-action version the Bat's ever had,  better than this 89 version.  But close your eyes for minute and imagine that it's the summer of 89 once again.....<br /><br />I don't think younger people realize just how big this movie was.  It was the biggest,  most expensive, and the most anticipated movie ever.  Blockbusters were already commonplace (this was the eighties),  but Batman was special.  You couldn't walk down the street without seeing that golden emblem somewhere.  An when it came out, it was a smash success.  It was the sixth highest grossing movie of all time.  So how does it hold up today?<br /><br />Not very well,  I'm afraid.  What was once so exciting and expensive,  now sadly looks cheap.  The story just wasn't very strong,  which I think was forgiven at the time because of all the visuals.  And that vision that Burton gave us still works today,  it's just the production values remain outdated.  Batman is very much a movie of it's time,  which is what prevents it from becoming a classic.  The Prince songs were not needed(watch the music videos on this DVD and wheep for all of those dollars that went into Mr. Artist Formerly Known As' bank account.)The style is sort of a bizarre combination between 30's/40's noir and the \\"latest\\" 80's fashions.  I think it would have worked better if they would have just gone all noir.  That would have allowed the film a more timeless feel.<br /><br />Of course,  movies aren't determined by their special effects and production design are they?  You have to have a story forst,  right?  Someone should've told Burton this.  Batman is an interesting character,  so why is in the spotlight so little?  Jack Nicholson may have-given a career defining performance (not his best mind you,  but what most immediately think of.),  but the movie is called \\"Batman.\\"  Duh.  Anyway with a number of under-developed and uninteresting side characters,  Batman just feels so dull when looked at with modern eyes.<br /><br />But why the four-star rating?  Well,  even though the movie hasn't aged well,  it still pulls my nostalgic strings and works inspite of all it's flaws.  First and forermost is Danny Elfman's amazing score.  I beleive that it gives this film legs to stand on.  It is my favorite score of all time.  It is at once dark,  mysterious,  powerfull,  and heroic.  Just listen to the last track playing during the last scene.  The camera rises up to the rafters ot Batman himself,  standing tall as the music swells to the greatest musical notes in the history of film. In my opinion anyway.

Oh well,  he's certainly back on the path of greatness now!<br /><br />So buy this DVD.  The features are very well deserved by this important movie.  Like it or not,  it was an EVENT.man just feels so dull when looked at with modern eyes. <br /> <br />But why the four-star rating?  Well,  even though the movie hasn't aged well,  it still pulls my nostalgic strings and works inspite of all it's flaws.  First and forermost is Danny Elfman's amazing score.  I beleive that it gives this film legs to stand on.  It is my favorite score of all time.  It is at once dark,  mysterious,  powerfull,  and heroic.

B000002H97|3.0|One of the best POP albums of all time, this heralded the beginning of the end for the classic (and imo, real) Metallica. There are still a few fizzling sparks of feeling here and there, but nothing to compare to the nuclear-powered sun of raw, sometimes brutal, sometimes exquisitely sad, but always beautifully potent emotion they once evidenced on the first 4.
B00029LNHS|4.0|I am only giving this album 4 stars because of the song 'Hey Mama' It is the only good song on this album.  Monkey Business has more better songs on it.  I never liked 'Where is the love' or 'Let's get it started' I know they were huge hits but they just didn't appeal to me.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this group just not this whole album.  If people love this album, great! U have good taste!  It's just not my top pick.
B000B7BRMM|1.0|I totally agree with the review that said Diana Krall does not sync up with the band.  There is something so totally off about her singing and it does not mesh with the traditional big band style that Christmas songs shine with. <br /> <br />I love Diana Krall.  I have since I was in college almost 10 years ago.  But listening to her singing on this album was just too much to bear.  Off key, strange phrasing, and a disregard for becoming one with the orchestra.  I am very disappointed.
B00005JOI3|2.0|The Jacob's Ladder plot trick resurfaces again. <br /> <br />That's ok but the entire movie is shot as if everyone is on bad acid. Really. <br /> <br />The cinematography is disturbing, almost a swirling mess. You keep trying to figure out what the h*** is going on.  In the end, you ask does any of this matter at all? <br /> <br />The plot concerns a troubled psychiatrist who tries to help his suicidally-depressed patient who is an art history student.  The doctor's wife is an artist who has tried to kill herself too. Or is she? <br /> <br />He's  really just a substitute for the student's usual psychiatrist who is off, one way or another.  <br /> <br />One reviewer said this was not your usual movie NYC.  They got that right, While I lived in New York for decades, I could identify almost nothing. (Yes, I recognized the Brooklyn Bridge.) <br />It is the New York not of movies or reality,  but of nightmares. <br /> <br />See it if you want. Let it freak you out a little. But don't try to figure it out. It can't be done. (However, the title does make sense.)
6305971099|3.0|Halloween 4 was a success in many ways. It introduced a new object of Michael Myers' affection, a new cast of characters to care about, a pretty fresh story line, and great acting as well as a couple scary moments. But where Halloween 4 triumphed, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers falls flat on its face. It's not to say that this movie is horrible; it definitely has its moments. However the stories and ideas seem rehashed, and the movie is just generally less interesting than the last. There's plenty of things wrong with the movie, but there's also a few things it got right, and for that reason it's not a total write off. Although the story found in Halloween 4,5 and 6 would later be ignored by H20 and Resurrection, the trilogy did have some promise. Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michael Myers just might not be the movie to stand out in the saga. <br /> <br />So of course Michael didn't die when he got shot down the empty mine shaft at the end of Halloween 4. You'd think the police would check for a body instead of throwing dynamite down there and assuming that Myers is done for (won't they ever learn). After falling down the shaft Myers crawls out a nearby escape hole and then floats down a river to the house of a hermit. Unsuspectingly the hermit nurses Myers back to health, and to show his gratitude to the kind fellow, Michael obviously kills him the first chance he gets. This is the first instance where see the \\"thorn\\" symbol on Myers' wrist (which would later attempted to be explain in Halloween 6), which becomes an underlying theme in the movie. It's as if Myers isn't just an evil individual, but rather someone being controlled by some \\"druid\\" cult or something. This is what presents a lot of problems with the plot. First there's a man dressed in black walking around the city, also with a \\"thorn\\" tattooed on the underside of his wrist (also explained in part six), but the mysterious man does relatively nothing in the movie. You see him from time to time(usually only the lower section of his body) walking the streets or following Loomis in the Myers house, but that's about it. The only thing he does is apparently break Myers out of prison at the end. It would have been nice to at least have this character do something for the movie besides walk around mysteriously (*Note you don't find out until Halloween 6: The Curse Of Michael Myers that the \\"man in black\\" was the one who helped Michael escape from prison, so if you had never seen part six and only viewed part five, his presence would make little or no sense to you). Myers is of course out to kill his niece Jamie once again, after failing last time. Unfortunately Jamie has become a mute after the events of Halloween 4, and now is mysteriously linked psychologically to her uncle (don't ask how). So Myers of course returns a year later on Halloween to kill again. Ultimately Loomis knows that Jamie is the only one who can help him stop Michael. The cast is good, and entertaining. Most of the actors from Halloween 4 have returned, including Danielle Harris as Jamie, Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis, and Ellie Cornell as Rachel (although she doesn't last long). Tina (Wendy Kaplan) is a welcomed introduction to the cast, and gives the movie enough flavor to make it distinct from the last film.  <br /> <br />My main complaint with the movie though (besides the less than stellar plot) is that this movie is just not scary or suspenseful. I mean when you watched any of the previous Halloween movies (except the God awful Halloween III: Season of The Witch) you actually cared about the characters and feared for their lives when Myers was after them. In Halloween 5 you almost want the idiotic teenagers and Tina's jerk of a boyfriend to get what they deserve from Michael. There are very few suspenseful parts found within the film, and even those lack the intensity that previous scenes had. Most of the scenes play off ridiculous murders (at one point Myers actually takes the timeto put a noose around a police officer's neck, before he throws him out the window. I didn't know serial killers has that kind of time). Myers even resorts to the least scary of methods to try to kill Jamie; he attempts to run over her with a car. Is this the same killer that we once feared in the previous movies? Also having Myers unmask himself, or even having him shed a tear in the scene with Jamie totally ruins his persona. The whole point of his character is that he was heartless and didn't care about who he killed. Now it seems Myers has a soul. The plot leaves a lot of holes in the story, and somehow you would have thought that the characters would have learned from the last film since it just happened. Sometimes it just seems ridiculous, almost like \\"I can't believe they are doing this again.\\" The only interesting thing about the plot is at the end when Myers has apparently escaped from his cell, leaving you with another cliffhanger (and a segway to the next movie). <br /> <br />Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers has its far share of problems. It's definitely one of the most inferior movies in the series (then again nothing beats good old Halloween III), but it has a couple moments. However plot holes, and generally uninteresting/hated characters really detract from the feeling the movie could have had. It didn't help that they attempted to make Myers a \\"human\\" in the film either (good thing they got him straightened out in the six film). If you're a die hard Halloween fan, then you might find some things about the film to enjoy, however overall it's a disappointment. Casual fans might want to skip this one, or only rent it/watch it on tv if they are interested. At this point the franchise started its decline for a bit, but thankfully it got back on track with H20 (only to be once again taken to the toilet by Halloween: Resurrection). I guess it serves a purpose in the end, but it does little for the series. Just don't go into it expecting too much.
B00005JMJG|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie more. <br /> <br />It has big name stars, a super cool title*, a premise that can't miss. <br /> <br />Ha!  The sci-fi premise of this sweet romance movie is that you can have your personal history changed by having your memories erased. <br /> <br />In the movie both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey decide to have their memories of their romance erased.  But Carrey changes his mind in the spin sycle and chaos ensues, as he tries to keep their romance or his memories of it alive. <br /> <br />The goofy CGI scene erasing just made me nuts.  Maybe once or twice it's effective, but finally it's a nauseating bore and I just stopped giving a darn about the characters or the story at all. Maybe there's till time to get free popcorn refill. <br /> <br />To make me not care about Ms. Winslet is some kind of major achievement. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the movie up until they went on max CGI. <br /> <br />* The title is lifted from Alexander Pope, the renowned 17th Century British poet. Sadly for me, it was the best part of the whole movie.  <br /> <br />Oh, crud, I just realized it's written by Charlie Kaufman, the man who penned the eminently weird Adaptation. (Invent a twin brother to help you? What?)
B000001ESF|5.0|I'll admit it: I am one of those horrible, horrible people who know nothing about prog. Although I have, along with most primates, the ability to detect a tempo change, I couldn't tell a 17/6 beat if it castrated me with a paper shredder. Since I can't talk about the \\"prog,\\" I shall speak about the \\"rock.\\"    And \\"2112\\" rocks. A lot. The mammoth title song is awesome. The acoustic sections don't drag, and the metal sections throw infectious riff after riff at thy ears. It has shrieking guitar solos, pounding bass, flawless drumming and vocals that range from shout-whining to soaring sing-whining. But don't get me wrong, Geddy has a fine voice and is enjoyable to listen to. The 20 minutes are over quickly, and you shall find yourself hitting \\"Skip -\\" soon after it phases out with a searing instrumental before announcing, \\"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation...we have assumed control...we have assumed control...we have assumed control...\\"    The rest of the CD is equally great. \\"Tears\\" is probably my favorite of the quintet; a beautiful melody, sheets of pseudo-strings and great vocals make this track one to remember. And remember. And remember...    The harder rocking \\"Something For Nothing\\" and \\"Bangkok\\" along with the psychadelic \\"Twilight Zone\\" are other great songs; the only \\"good, not great\\" track would probably be \\"Lessons.\\"    As a whole, \\"2112\\" is one of those amazing CDs that won't leave your player for any, any reason for quite a while. Buy it for \\"2112,\\" the other five are like finally locating your wallet and discovering an extra five-hundred bucks inside. Get it. Now.
B00006690G|3.0|Eminem is one of the best reppers in the whole world, you might not agree with this, but thats my oppinion and I am standing toll with it. The reason I am saying that is because unlike any other rappers, Eminem does not rap about how rich he is and how beautiful his life is. Instead he shows how thing are really are and gives some tips how to deal with it, especially in this album \\"The Eminem Show\\", he raps about his harsh childhood and the real world around us. All of his best songs are gathered here. And none of it includes some crap that most rappers sing about: money, cars and jewerly. <br /> <br />In this album Eminem points out all the bed and the good thing that we human beings are facing every day. The good example of thins would be song \\"White America\\" where Eminem is strongly against racism and American industry over all, and the way of life in the lower class. Some people does not realize the things that are happening to us and what it may lead to in the future. Em does a great job bringing those promlems in many different aspects, thats why I think that he is brilliant. <br /> <br />Over all Eminems carrier was not that popular untill he started acting more mature and thoughtful. I agree with some critics that Em was not always on the top of all, and his lyrics did not make any sence to some listener; also I am sure that there are many haters of him; and many of his works were not so pleasent to listen. But with time he gained more experience and self-esteem which rocked his way to the top.  <br /> <br />In my opinion this album is one of the best that was realised by Eminem and you should get it right away, if haven't yet.
B00009V7T2|5.0|\\"De-Loused\\" is a crazy, insane album full of irresistable hooks, melodies, hard rocking guitars, otherworldly sound effects and some of the best vocals that I've ever heard. It should be required listening for everyone in ze vorld.    It is well that it begins with a catchy track (cut two, disregading the introduction) because the other eight songs require a couple of listens to really grasp. A feeling of \\"uh, yeah, right, whatever...\\" is prevelent after the first run, but keep at it and it won't leave thy CD player for veeks.    All of the songs are great, and I go through periods of obsession for each, but the ones that always stick out to me are tracks 1/2, 3, 5, 7, 9 (an unexpected, beautiful ballad) and 10. Track 7 has a very long period of white noise, but the core parts more than make up for it. The closer, track 10, goes from semi-techno to hard rock to electronica to AWESOME free jazz and back to hard rock in time for the stunning closer. It's just one amazing track on an amazing album.    Another plus are the lyrics; I can certainly identify with them. *Sigh* I remember the first time I had my transient jet lag, ecto-mimed bison and heard the shelve of pigs' smothered cries for the first time. MEMORIIIIES, WHOA WHOA, MEMORIEEES--    *comes off of nostalgia trip* just by the damn CD.
020161622X|2.0|As most other reviewers, I was drawn in by the glowing commentaries here on Amazon. <br /> <br />As background, I've been programming professionally for nine years now, on a variety of projects, but generally high-performance embedded stuff. I'm interested in improving my software development & management skills, and have read a number of other, better books (listed later) about these topics. <br /> <br />My first criticism is that the collection of 50-odd tips are simply too shallowly presented to be very interesting. Generally, if you agree, you say, \\"yeah, duh,\\" and if you don't, there's no discussion of the point, and no attempt to address known difficulties with \\"good\\" practices. There also seemed to be no attempt to balance some of the points. For example, the authors repeatedly talk about writing your code so it's flexible. In general, a good idea. On the other hand, they really seem to think you should be writing everything, regardless of what sort of application it is, to run on different machines, under different operating systems, with and without concurrency, etc. This, to me, just seems foolish, extra work, extra code, extra bugs. The estimates I've seen (in other, better, books) say that just writing re-usable code takes three times more work than \\"normal\\" code, ignoring multi-platform complexities. <br /> <br />The old school comment (and I consider myself fairly old school) is there because they very obviously come from a Unix/command line environment. I will admit, they motivated me to improve my scripting skills, something I've been planning on doing for a while. But then they have inane advice, like \\"use only one editor *for everything*\\". This is perhaps nice, if you can, but on larger projects or organizations, this probably isn't possible. I use the IDE required by the project, a different editor for documentation (also required) and a third one for doing hex & advanced search and replace. Perhaps with emacs and 47 scripts this wouldn't be necessary, but I'm not convinced it would be efficient either. <br /> <br />All in all, the advice is generally good, but I think there are better books out there (e.g. Code Complete, Writing Solid Code, Rapid Development, The Mythical Man-Month, C++ Coding Standards). As a light book to get you thinking about your craft, it's not bad, but that's the best I can say about it.  <br /> <br />
1573223085|5.0|this is a fantastic book.  i've just ordered 9 more copies to give to my management team.  but i do find it highly ironic that a book with such emphasis on design and beauty would have one of the dullest, ugliest book designs i've seen in a very long time.  maybe the publisher never read the book!
B000001GXI|5.0|Though not a perfect recording, this is one that lingers with growing affection.  Plenty has been written about the glory of Wunderlich as Pamino - and all of it is evident from the first sung note to his last.  With his honey tone and peerless phrasing, Wunderlich creates a masterpiece within a masterpiece.  Crass as Sarasto and Fischer-Dieskau as Papageno, furthermore, nearly match the wonder of the show's star.  It is true, the ladies fare less well.  Peters is technically brilliant (contrary to popular opinion), but lacking in characterization - one wishes for the Queen of the Night to be a force of Nature, but Peters' voice is too light.  Lear is nothing more than a serviceable Pamina - rather bland, actually.  On the other hand, Otto is pure delight as Papageno's perfect match Papagena and so is the ensemble that makes up the Three Ladies.  So, in the end, with an evident mixed bag of vocalists what pushes this recording to the level of genuine greatness?  Karl Bohm.  If the listener insists that Mozart's operatic swan song is mainly a trifle of a plot and a \\"fun\\" and fleeting flight of fantasy with gorgeous music -- then this listener does not deserve this recording.  If, however, the listener believes that this work was the boy genius' last and greatest testament of his faith in music -- then there is no other.  Bohm, stripped of fake profundity, narcissistic intellectualism and empty polish so prevelant in modern recordings, guides the Berlin Phil to lovingly and delicately express the deep, epic spiritual essence behind the music.  There is not a wasted gesture, nor is there one which calls attention to itself.  Flaws and all -- this recording remains my favorite. It's a thing of beauty.****1/2 <br /> <br />Other references:  Top recommendation - Rough Guide; High recommendation - Penguin Guide, Classical Music: Third Ear
0345457684|4.0|Bloody and violent, but very intelligent and ambitious, this is one of the best recent sci-fi debuts. The concept of sleeving, that is pouring one's consciousness into a carrier vessel, is not exactly new, but well thought out, with all the logistical and technological details. Questions concerning morality in a world where you could be theoretically immortal, religion in a world where everything is for sale and many other interesting observations are sprinkled throughout, but the action itself is great, and main plot, the noir style detective story of uncovering the truth about a suspicious suicide of a powerful rich guy, is very well done. Graphic violence, sex, drugs and sleaze mean this is not one for the squeamish, but this book leaves some food for thought in its bloody trail. Highly recommended to fans of Marlowe, Philip K. Dick and exciting sci-fi in general.
6304119046|5.0|The enduring influence of Citizen Kane was demonstrated yet again, by George Clooney's brilliant directorial debut, \\"Good Night, and Good Luck\\".  Great film--very timely--highly recommended.  Not in Kane's shadow but a distant descendant aware of its indebtedness.  There's even a quick reference to Hearst.    (Note that maybe last year's finest film, Scorsese's \\"The Aviator\\", also owed a fair bit to Kane.)
B00009V7P8|5.0|I have no words to describe Damien Rice's \\"O\\" perfectly.  I can do no justice with the little bit of English that I know, but listening to this album causes my heart to swell with more emotion that any CD that I have ever owned.  This CD evokes memories of my life, memories of love gained and lost, and hope of the future.  It's timeless, anthemic, and a CD that I highly recommend to anyone who considers themselves introspective and deep in thought over anything of significance. <br /> <br />I look forward to more music by this artist.  His outlook and beats are fresh, words inspiring thought, and almost, just almost carries the listener to another world with all of his art. <br /> <br />I keep this CD with me at all times.
0307276902|1.0|Having been through treatment and four other members of my family being through treatment at the facility he so clearly describes, I am offended and angry at him and his book. I am 69 years old and have never read a book that I have been as upset over. <br />I am 23 years sober and now work in the field of treatment and have never, I repeat never, seen any treatment facility that would conduct treatment in the manner described in this book. He obviously wrote this to sensationalize his story so that others will buy the book. There is nothing in the book that is accurate or even remotely true. <br />My fear is that it will cause many persons to refuse going to treament who might otherwise have been helped with their addiction. This book will not save lives, it may in fact cause some lives to end in the destruction of addiction. <br />Facilities could not possibly operate in the manner he describes or they would be closed by governing and licensuring boards. How could he possibly believe that he would not get a huge negative response to this, or maybe that is his point in order to sell more books.  <br />As a work of fiction, it is compelling. As a biography it is a work of fiction!!
1573229725|5.0|Sarah Waters' \\"Fingersmith\\" was one of the most beautiful novels of the year. This year had a number of special novels for the literary world, but this one has a great place among them. Set in 1860s Victorian world, it shows the life of Sue Trindon in a harsh Gothic atmosphere. It shows London as a city where pornography, emotional abuse and rape are the natural bedfellows of greed and lovelessness. The herione knows that her mother has been hanged for murder. She is brought up by two women who are into crimes that are scary. It's a rough, crooked yet comradely household, which is occasionally visited by one Richard Rivers, a debonair criminal, forger and seducer. This book shows how the person copes with the different circumstances she is in, and comes to like them.<br /><br />This books shows that the story is many things, a thriller and a love story. It is passionate and startling in its portrayal. Sufficient to say, it is erotic and unnerving in all the right ways. Long, dark, twisted and satisfying, it's a fabulous piece of writing, but Waters's most impressive achievement is that she also makes it feel less like reading, more like living: an unforgettable experience. Despite the excessive attention to detail, one is not put off from the tension that the book depicts, especially in the end. It cleverly shows the Victorian world in all its detail with a modern touch. Sarah Waters is one of the most respected authors of the younger generation and this novel proves it.
0140131558|1.0|I was very excited during the first fifty or so pages of \\"City of Glass\\", but at around the midpoint all of the interesting ideas that had been introduced ceased to develop further. In fact, nothing else really happened at all and I never got any answers or conclusion. I feel that it was not so much a story as a practical joke on the reader. Perhaps real literature isn't necessarily supposed to satisfy. Well I'm satisfied with \\"City of Glass\\" anyway. At least I know who I won't be reading any more of.
0780626966|5.0|I love the nightmare series (expect 2) and i was glad that they came out with a box set. The set contains everything you need and more. Lots of special features, commentary, a chessy maze with lots of goodies, the whole nine yards. I loved the commentary with Robert Engulnd and Heather Leggendcamp. they are hilarious people with lots to say to tune in. The dvd also inclued CD glasses (woooo ahhh) for nightmare on elm street 6..... the movie as a whole is horrible but with CD glasses it that was much WORSE! YAY! And it's great to look back to see emmy winner patrica arquette in nightmare 3 and 4.... ahhh good times.... <br />Jared O!
B000062X9B|5.0|I never liked Johnny Cash, and I've been a music fan for most of my 55+ years.  Then, a year ago, I was in a used record shop in Norwich, England, when I heard something that stopped me in my tracks.  \\"Who the hell is that?\\" I asked the kid behind the counter.  \\"It's Johnny Cash,\\" he said.  And so it was, Johnny Cash singing \\"Spiritual\\", from one of the American records.  I was stunned and overwhelmed by the lean beauty of that song, and the courage of the man singing it.  Since that trip, I've bought all the American albums.  This one, though, is simply my favorite.  Cash's cover of Neil Diamond's Solitary Man is brilliant.  And \\"The Mercy Seat\\" is just overwhelming in its emotional intensity and its deep ring of the truth.  Was I ever wrong for all those years about The Man in Black.  This music, spare, lean, intense, haunted, and brave, is unlike any American music I have ever heard.  It comes closest to the raw intensity of the best of the blues.  But it's all Johnny Cash, the one and only.  Hear it, weep, and rejoice.  This is a consummate artist at the peak of his career, even at its end.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I thought it was very exciting and very good, but I didn't think it was great.  Then I read numerous professional reviews, including one by noted sci-fi author Orson Scott Card, calling \\"Serenity\\" the \\"best sci-fi movie ever made\\".  I was skeptical.  Certainly it was better than all of the Star Wars prequels, but that's like saying filet mignon is better than hamburger.  So I went to see it two more times.  Then it clicked.  This movie is so full of subtleties and significant small details that make it so much more complex than the usual blunt-force sci-fi movie of recent years (or any years, for that matter).  If it's not the absolute best sci-fi movie ever, it's certainly right up there with the best.  The key to understanding that is to watch it several times.  That, of course, makes it an ideal dvd purchase.  You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but grow to appreciate it more and more every time you see it.
B00005JOGU|5.0|First and foremost, this film is anchored by the brilliant performance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  I know many others have said the same thing, but this performance MUST get an Oscar nomination.  It seems highly unlikely that there will be a better lead performance this year.  This is a riveting, intelligent movie...but would be completely sunk without a great performance.  Truman Capote was an odd man...and his mannerisms and voice would have been easy to turn into caricature...Hoffman makes him as real and believable as such a person could be.   <br /> <br />The movie surrounds the creation of the non-fiction novel IN COLD BLOOD, about a brutal murder of a family in a small farming community.  For 1959, it was particularly brutal (although while watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that if the same happened today, it might not even make the national news), and Capote initially sets out to write an article about the effects of the killings on the community.  But he's first drawn in by the crimes and a fascination with the brutality.  (He even peeks in on the closed caskets to discover that the faces of the victims have been swaddled in cotton because they were so badly damaged by the shotgun blasts.)  He wins the reluctant trust of the head law enforcement official (Chris Cooper) and the story begins to take shape.  But when the perpetrators are caught, and Capote attends the perp walk, he is instantly drawn to one suspect, Perry King.  He finagles a meeting with King and discovers a soft-spoken, highly intelligent soul, in some ways a kindred spirit.  Capote is also gay, and the film hints that there might have been a physical attraction to Perry, but it never asserts this as a primary motivator...which is good, because there is no real historical evidence for this, and it would have cheapened this highly textured and layered movie. <br /> <br />Capote is a man torn apart by conflicting feelings.  He misses his lover back home (well-played by a gently aging Bruce Greenwood) but he begins to feel at home in the small town.  His manner of dressing even begins to tone down for the \\"local folk.\\"  He is horrified by the crime, but drawn to King.  He also senses that he has the makings of a groundbreaking book.  King and his partner are quickly tried and sentenced to death...before Capote can get all he needs from King.  So he arranges high-priced legal help for the men, just to draw out the process.  Naturally,  King is grateful for the friendship.  But is Capote really a friend?  Or is he just a selfish man?  The movie has it both ways...which is its strength.  At no time does it settle for easy answers or clichd feelings.  Hoffman is compelled again and again to depict a man who doesn't clearly know his own heart...or doesn't want to face it.  He runs for months at a time, but is pulled in again and again.  Hoffman handles these challenges brilliantly.  Frankly, I doubt there is another film actor working right now capable of executing this role.  I can't even imagine who else the director might have had in mind for the part. <br /> <br />Another key role (an another Oscar nomination, one can hope) is the character of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD author Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener, one of the best actresses around.  At first, she is simply his lifelong friend and now his \\"research assistant.\\"  They travel to the crime scene together and she helps Truman seem a little more normal.  But halfway through the film, her book is published, and she becomes the most celebrated writer in America.  Capote is torn apart by jealousy.  It's an unattractive side to him, and there is a brief but lovely scene when Lee recognizes how torn up Capote is, and instead of confronting her old friend (and believe me, she isn't one to necessarily spare his feelings), she offers a brief moment of comfort.  Her understanding allows us to know just deeply Capote has gone off his tracks at this point. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the film, all the appeals run out for the two condemned men, and there are some death row and execution scenes that are downright chilling.  We don't feel bad that the men are sentenced to die, but the quietness of the scenes is very effective.  Yes, executions make almost naturally compelling drama, but the filmmakers have gone above and beyond.  These are not glossy scenes (a la THE GREEN MILE or DEAD MAN WALKING); they are dusty, grim and heart pounding.  The young actor Clifton Collins Jr, who plays Perry, does a terrific job throughout, but he shines in these scenes.  Never over the top, we nonetheless get a sense of the terror and resignation he is feeling.  And we can get a pretty good idea of why Capote's career descended into booze and ineffectuality after these events. <br /> <br />The movie is not flawless.  Although it's less than two hours, the pace is just a little slack and indulgent, and the movie feels just a little bit too long.  While the movie does a terrific job in art direction (it feels beautifully of the late `50s and early `60s), the cinematography seemed a bit obvious at times.  It used the same establishing show of New York City over and over.  I assume some of this was budget limitations, but it's a flaw nonetheless.  But these are minor flaws.  What the film DOES have going for it is a terrific script, a compelling story, and a fistful of textured, highly intelligent performances.  I highly recommend this film...one of the best of the year. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I read several reviews, including some by respected professional critics, when this came out saying that \\"Serenity\\" was the \\"best sci-fi movie ever made\\" and I was somewhat skeptical.  I had seen it once at that time and had thought it was indeed very good and that it was certainly better than any of the Star Wars prequels.  But that's like saying filet mignon is better than hamburger.  So I went to see it a couple more times.  Then it clicked.  This movie is so detailed and nuanced that it can only truly be appreciated after multiple viewings.  There's simply too much going on at once, both visually and aurally, to fully grasp the complexity of this film in one sitting.  This, of course, makes it the ideal movie to purchase on dvd.  You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but come to appreciate it more and more each time you see it.  Also, keep an eye on Summer Glau's performance as River Tam - probably won't get an Oscar nomination, but she certainly deserves one.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Another Reviewer very shrewdly said that we have come to the point now in the music business where we expect every Bands second album to be an automatic slump. Alot of people out there are rejecting the second album without ever giving it a chance. It is difficult, without question, to re-create a fresh approach after such a successful first album. yet I certainly believe this is better than the first without question. Why you ask? Well because from a personnal opinion i did really rate the the first album. In Amazon terms it was a three-star album and no better. The insanely catchy 'Take Me Out' proppelled the album above and beyond it's worth. It was good album without question but I just didn't see what was so brilliant about it. This album however, I feel, shows a real improvement over a strong first album. The first four or five tracks are fantastic and perhaps tails slightly to the end, but only slightly. The Music I feel is more consistenly stronger on this album. There is no stand-out track on the album like 'Take Me Out' which is certainly down as a modern classic. And I think its better for it. Perhaps I am being way too over-critical of the first album because of the great success of 'Take Me Out' over-shadowing it. Yet by the same token many people are being wildly unfair to their second album which is catchy consistent and strong right the way through. What else could we ask for; perhaps a Take me Out remix??
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I have loved Joss Whedon for over a third of my life. Since the first episode of Buffy I was completely hooked on the guy and his genius and I have not turned back. I had extremely high expectations for his theatrical directorial debut, and I am very happy to say that \\"Serenity\\" more than exceeded all my expectations.  <br /> <br />At first I must admit that I was skeptical at certain points. I loved \\"Firefly\\" and was more than overjoyed when the \\"Firefly\\" DVDs were released years ago so that I could watch them over and over and over. But I was skeptical as to how successfully Joss could introduce the characters and their \\"verse\\" to first timers while adding something new and relevant to the story for those of us who have enjoyed the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew for years now. Of course I should never have worried. I have seen this film multiple times with many different people who had never watched a second of \\"Firefly\\" yet completely fell in love with the story and the characters. There is a feeling of unity that Joss establishes with his casts and characters that no other writer/director/producer can even attempt to establish. Joss's cast and characters have a comaraderie about them that is uniquely Joss and uniquely fun. He did it with Buffy, he did it again with Angel, he did if for a third (and possibly most successful) time with Firefly, and he continues it with his work on Marvel Comics comic book, \\"Astonishing X-Men.\\" There is a familial warmth that is undeniable, and it is part of what makes the film \\"Serenity\\" so spectacular.  <br /> <br />This movie is the kind of movie that one can truly watch over and over and over again. Every time I've seen it I have heard new lines that made me laugh outloud that I didn't notice before because I was already laughing so loud at something a character has said. The witty quips and dialogue of this movie are unparalleled in every other movie ever, with the possible exception of \\"Army of Darkness.\\"Whether the humor is from Mal's muscle-man, Jayne, obvious funnyman, Wash, Mal himself, or any of the other brilliant characters, this movie is hilarious. In a very intelligent and surprising way. The humor just adds to the plot which took my breath away with its intricacies and perfection. Honestly, I cannot say enough good about this movie.  <br /> <br />Whether you are a fan of sci-fi, westerns, comedy, action, romance, or whatever, this movie is for you. It's brilliant. This is the movie George Lucas should have made. It's like early, awesome Han Solo only 8,000,000 times cooler than that could ever be because Joss has something George never had: heart. His heart and his intelligence bleed all over this film, and I truly hope that the DVD sales are astronomical so hopefully, sometime in the near future, Joss can take us back to his brilliant Serenity on yet another amazing tale.  <br /> <br />Of course, if you buy the full screen version, something amazingly gorgeous will get cut.  The visuals in this epic film are on par with films that cost literally hundreds more millions of dollars to make (ie all three Star Wars Prequels) so I say go all out and get widescreen to take in all the gorgeous beauty that is \\"Serenity.\\"  But even in full screen format it's still worth every penny. <br />
B0009S3HI0|5.0|Just like every Deftones CD, you don't really get into it at first, you have to listen to it and let it grow on you. At first I wasn't really thrilled about this CD, but now that I've actually listened to it over and over, I love it. Very different from most Deftones discs, and not as heavy, but still great. No Deftones CD is alike, so that's normal. The only songs that I wish would have been on here is \\"The Boys Republic\\" and \\"Lovers\\". The DVD is kind of a letdown, only videos and a little bit of random in between video stuff. I was hoping for some Deftones commentary and live performances and stuff. And most Deftones videos aren't that interesting. But anyways, the CD is great, but I really wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't a fan of the Deftones. Start with the actual CD's first.

B00097DXZS|1.0|Although I am a HUGE fan of Santana, this album sucks BIG TIME and I am really pissed for wasting money on a \\"below average quality collaboration\\" album.<br /><br />When I want to listen to Santana, I want to listen to Santana, not a scramble of duets where NOISE, not music is the main result.<br /><br />And those who think this album is good, go listen previous albums of Santana then you will realize THAT WAS THE REAL SANTANA.<br /><br />This album is a HUGE step back in Santana production and in its musical journey. I could barely \\"feel\\" his \\"musical signature\\" (as in his guitar) from the rest, where the rest is a \\"pathetic\\" mixture of the \\"present\\" cool singers/whatever...<br /><br />Sorry, as much as I love Santana, I was and am ashamed to have spent even just 17 dollars (canadian) for an album that went straight into my closet, labeled \\"LOSER\\".<br /><br />Save your money and your love for Santana, sticking with his better, previous albums.
0451169514|5.0|I first read IT when I was nine years old, and something about it really struck me home, so i reread it twelve years later, and figured it out: IT grabs you emotionally, sucks you in and attaches you to the characters like a leash, in that awesome way that only stephen king can project. This is by far his best book (in my opinion), however, many people will be turned off because of its size. Dont worry, it reads pretty easy, and you wont be dissapointed. It is a wonderful and touching coming of age novel, confronting your fears at a later time in life. Follow the lucky seven through 1090 pages of fun terror, heartache and nostalgia. read IT and love it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Put Phil Spector John Lennon, Paul Mccartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison in the studio and what have you got? Magic overshadowed. Let It Be Naked... is the version the beatles wanted you to hear, they've taken away all the Spectorized production and gotten down to the songs themselves. Your right next to them now this is what you would have heard had you been in the studio. Turn the volume all the way up and drive while wearing a rain coat.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Another album with slutty songs written by horny guys who can't get any action.  Britney gets more pathetic with each album.  There are so many more talented artists out there: Ashlee Simpson, Gretchen Wilson, Leann Rimes, Shania Twain, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore n Hilary Duff.  All who write their own music and have actual talent.  I agree with Kristen Dunker \\"Kat\\" This album is pure smut and sends an inappropriate message to young girls.  Girls are under enough peer pressure and they don't need this tart adding to it with suggestive lyrics and skimpy outfits.
B00006RIO7|4.0|While I think that they did an excellent job with this film, the voices ofthese Stars do not impress me for such a show.  I feel like they have had a lot of training and are signing their best, but they do not compare to the talents of \\"Real Musical Theater Singers\\".  With the exception of the song Mr. Cellophane which is superior!  But in general the CD is exciting.
B000007XUQ|5.0|This is one of the most well made albums I've ever heard. From the singing techniques to the complex chords.<br /><br />I believe the christmas spirit in the world nowadays is fading away. After listening to this album, you will really get the feeling of how christmas really is. Karen Carpenter's melodic voice and Richard Carpenter's great orchestrations and arrangements put together result in a very unique and spellbinding atmosphere.<br /><br />Most of the artists nowadays usually just make a christmas album to profit from their popularity ending up in nothing different from their original styles like Destiny's child for instance. When I heard that they had a Christmas album, I quickly went to one of these record stored to buy it but when I heard the songs, I was like \\"what is this!?!\\" It was nothing but an RNB style album with nothing more christmasy but the lyrics. That doesn't apply to this album. Each song is special in it's own way.<br /><br />It may be too early listening to christmas songs in October but it's the right time to get the feel and atmosphere of it. Christmas melodies are just so different from normail 21st Century Music. I'd advice you all to listen to old classic christmas albums like Nat King Cole's or more in the 1930's-1970s. Those were the times you could really call music \\"music\\".<br /><br />Listen to it while you lie on your sofa. Close your eyes and sing along sometimes. Even if sweat is pouring from your forehead, you could still feel the chill of Christmas.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|When will Elfman get his due credit.  The man is one of the most versitile composers of his day, and has not been awarded a thing.  Personally I think that Nightmare before Christmas was his best.  But Corpse Bride was fantastic.  He know how to fit into Burton's visions perfectly.
0679745203|4.0|The English Patient is novel motivated by intrigue.  In story that is as mysterious as the shadowy Tuscan villa in which it unfolds, Ondaatje skillfully weaves together the lives of four war-ravaged individuals.  There is Hana, a young nurse who has renounced emotion after the deaths of her father and lover; Kip, a stoic and mechanical Sikh sapper who has embraced a tenuous and solitary existence; and Caravaggio, a once suave thief who has been discharged with maimed hands and an uncertain identity.  Flotsam of the Italian Campaign, these three disoriented souls drift around the centerpiece of the novel - an encyclopedic man burned beyond physical recognition.  In unraveling the cloak surrounding the English Patient's past, the others begin convalescence. <br /> Ondaatje is a masterful visual artist.  By communicating the story through sequences of stream-of-consciousness recollections and haphazard but vivid flashbacks, he impresses images of \\"the white plain of her stomach\\" or \\"the permanent desert winds that live in present tense\\" into readers' minds.  These fleeting glimpses into the characters' complex pasts never constitute an entire piece of the puzzle but serve their purpose by engaging curiosity.  By intertwining elegant statements such as \\"`Give me a map and I'll build you a city. Give me a pencil and I will draw you a room in South Cairo, desert charts on the wall,'\\" the author creates mystiques unique to each of the characters.  An intricately connected web of human emotions, The English Patient is a compelling read.  While its appeal may not be towards the general audience, engaged readers will find it near impossible to untangle themselves from the labyrinthine lives of this novel's characters.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Is a happy Eric Clapton a good thing? Is it really Eric Clapton? <br /> <br />Those are the questions that Clapton fans are asking after this new release -- Clapton's first original album in seven years. And the album's tone is decidedly up -- from the opening bars of \\"So Tired\\" we see a man who might be tired, but he's happy about it. <br /> <br />In \\"So Tired\\" we can even hear why Clapton's so tired -- a baby cries in the background of the song. The song is infectuous, and very happy. <br /> <br />\\"Say What You Will\\" has potential to be a sad song -- \\"Say what you will/good love is hard to find./And I've had my fill/of the hurting kind.\\" But it's a song about good love -- \\"You found the best in me.\\" It's a happy song because of the sadness that went before it. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Going Left\\" is a song about changes -- and there's a shade of spiritual content in the song, talking about spiritual changes in life. The song is tinged with Gospel influences, including the backing vocals. I can see myself singing along with this one in the car. <br /> <br />\\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\" -- four songs in, and we hit a blues-tinged ballad. A heart-sick, broken hearted song, this is the first time we hear a even a hint of sadness on the album. <br /> <br />I won't go all the way through the playlist. One of the complaints I've heard from Clapton fans is that the album is too 'up' for an Eric Clapton album. And \\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\" is a strong track, probably stronger than most on the album. But Clapton writes what is true for him -- a quick look at the credits shows that he wrote the happiest-sounding songs on the disc. He's a happy man -- and a happy man can't sing the blues (if that isn't a song, it should be!). <br /> <br />One other complaint I've heard is that the album neglects Clapton's guitar skills. I'll have to admit that I agree here -- I was looking for more guitar work than is on this album. \\"Lost and Found\\" and \\"Piece Of My Heart\\" are both great blues-rockers, and feature some good guitar licks, but the album fell short of my expectations in this area. Those two tracks, along with \\"Revolution\\" (which I reviewed previously) are probably my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />This one wasn't what I expected, but it's earned a place in the collection. It's a fun CD, and a welcome release. Seven years is, after all, a long time to wait.
B000060P79|5.0|this CD is great, simple plan write really creativly, not like all the bands that you people who hate the cd are like, all the bands you like sing about death and various criminal offences!!! anyway, if you hate the CD, why are you reviewing it? and why the hell did you look it up on amazon! everyone likes different music, and you sure as hell dont have the right to put them into categories, just because you like different music. Anyone looking at this CD who doesnt have it, ignore all those sad posers, they need to grow up. simple plan are like no other band ive heard before, they sound so fresh and dont resort to bad language and violence in their lyrics. buy this CD now! it rocks, and also check out there new album, still not getting any, its even better! <br />and all you idiots who call over people posers to protect your own title of being posers, get a life. honestly, who are you to say what music people can like.
B000AXSN5G|3.0|Old man lying by the side of the road with the lorries rolling by...gone but he's not forgotten<br /><br />I used to like Neil Young from the moment I heard the refrsin of the Loner and I had followed his up and down career through the great Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere / After the Goldrush to the frankly awful, Old Ways, but finally gave up about four albums ago not buying Passionate, Greendale etc.<br /><br />I was tempted into this purchase by the hype referred to in other reviews and alas, have been bitterly dissappointed by the result. After all these years a pattern emerges. You know it is not good when Neil reverts to this country stuff. I recall an interview during the years of dispute with David Geffen when Young said that he could churn out these country albums every few weeks if he had too. ...and it shows.<br /><br />Now we all get old and we all have our problems and Neil Young is no different. I hope that he has a happy life and I know that he has done great charitable work through the Bridge and a host of unpublished other things. I know too that as an artist he uses his chosen medium to display to the world emotions, feelings views and opinions. I do not expect him to always be the sharp social commentator of Ohio or a bluesman but I do expect him to be a little incisive with his published biting and nuanced lyrics. I love the grunge music and the folk stuff but I really do not like this nostalgia trip and the things were better in my day stuff.<br /><br />It is almost as if Neil Young has disappeared and a cardboard replica has taken over his place in society. If I can command the reader's attention for a moment compare Neil with Paul McCartney. Now Macca is no Neil but he has got a gift for a good melody and a way with words but without John or Elvis Costello he can be a bland musakman. Neil seems to have lost the plot.<br /><br />These songs are nice, the words are nice, the tunes are nice, the album is nice and the packaging and DVD are nice. If I had wanted nice I would have bought McCartney.<br /><br />I hate to say this but when I play this, and believe me I have played and played this I am reminded of a visit to my grandma, long dead, where time stood still. Paul Simon wrote,<br /><br />Long ago it must be<br /><br />I have a photograph<br /><br />Preserve your memories<br /><br />They're all that's left you<br /><br />After hearing this so many times it is how I feel. It makes me sad that this poet has degenerated so far into this road to oblivion. Hopefully the archive albums will help restore his well earned reputation as one of the greatest singer songwriters of the twentieth century which this album has done so much to expunge.

B000BW7QX6|5.0|A few months ago I was introduced to the failed TV series Firefly. At first I was very leery of it because it sounded like a hokey b-movie thing, and frankly it having been made by the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was not a really good recommendation for me. I looked in while my roommate was watching an episode, and was hooked before the first 10 minutes were over. I then borrowed the whole series and devoured them. After watching I found out about the upcoming Serenity movie that was a continuation of that series.  <br /> <br />Fast-forward 5 months of anticipation, punctuated by occasional tidbits of information from those that had seen it in prescreenings. <br /> <br />Sep 30 came and I, and many of my friends were waiting for the theater to open.  <br /> <br />This film was everything I could have hoped it would be. It was fabulous for old fans of the series, and also great fun for those that were new to the story. It was by turns, funny, exciting, and shocking. This film has heart on a scale that I rarely see. <br /> <br /> <br />The characters seemed like people you might actually meet somewhere, and the villain was scary enough to make you believe him. This is not some SFX bonanza. There is just enough SFX to make you believe the environment might just exist, and the cinematography is wonderful. The movie starts with a minutes long continuous take that shows the scope of the ship, and many of the principle players. <br /> <br />If you like Sci-fi at all give this one a shot. I seriously doubt you will be disappointed. <br />
0156027321|5.0|Probably one of the better fiction tales I've ever read.  The story of a boy thrown off a ship in a storm and being the only survivor of his family would sound dark, but it's funny and moving, sad and amazing, and thought provoking.  What I got out of it was a story of survival, faith, creativity, love, humor and adventure.  Kind of like \\"The Princess Bride\\" - it has it all!  I highly recommend this book.

B000087DRK|5.0|This is a great introduction to the best band of our time.  Turbonegro combines the classic punk style of the clash and the sex pistols with amazing guitar solos by euroboy who could be called the modern day hendrix.  This album is without a doubt one of the greatest albums OF ALL TIME!!!  and could hold it's own with any of the great classic rock albums.  every song is a hit, if you are a rock listener, turbonegro is definately the band to get into... if you haven't already.
B000002H33|5.0|That hasn't already been said? <br />Every song on here is a masterpiece, classic, timeless. <br />My favorites are Master of Puppets and Disposable Heroes. <br /> <br />P.S. <br /> <br />Metallica is supposedly making another cd.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|I have been waiting for this release since DVD players came out.  I am pleased to fantasize that by February my fantasy will be reality. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed the Sci-Fi channel miniseries, I found that this movie captured FAR more of Herbert's more subtle nuance.  If you read the book, you will most likely enjoy the Lynch version than the SF version. <br /> <br />Of course, if you DIDN'T read the book, this movie won't be worth the time.  The book has so much detail which is referred to in this version (which is why I like it better) that if you are not familiar with the text, this will be highly unintelligible (much like Kubrick's 2001). <br /> <br />If you didn't read the book, get the Sci-Fi version.  It is a bare shell compared to this version, but it makes sense as a movie. <br /> <br />Of course, you should read the book.  You should read 2001 by Clarke, too, if you want to take the advice of someone who you don't know.
B000001E18|4.0|This is my second review of Zooropa.  I am disposing of my original review because I now feel quite different about this album, thanks to repeated listenings and additional insight from other reviewers here who were able to get me to wake up and realize the genius in this particular piece of art.  For truth's sake, I absolutely must submit this edited version.<br /><br />I originally stated that this album was \\"not essential\\" in the average U2 fan's library.  I insisted that the \\"novelty wears off\\" after listening to it for a while.  Well, now I'm just going to be blunt.  This album is better than All That You Can't Leave Behind, and it may even be better than How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (two of U2's most recent offerings).<br /><br />Actions speak louder than words, and I find myself listening to this album (and genuinely enjoying it as I listen) quite a bit more often than ATYCLB and Bomb.  It just clicked with me all of a sudden -- I finally \\"get it.\\"  Put simply, this album is fresh, innovative, and exciting, and it does a wonderful job of bringing us further into the uncharted, murky territories that we were introduced to with Achtung Baby.<br /><br />Some of my original contentions and descriptions still stand true (because I didn't *completely* dismiss the entire album in my first review), so I will repeat them again here.  The opening of this disc is suspenseful, tense, and eventually turns into one heck of a crazed rocker.  \\"Lemon\\" is upbeat, colorful, and mystifying.  \\"Dirty Day\\" is an aptly-named killer song that will stun you with its simplicity.  \\"The First Time\\" is soulfully deep, and there's even a guest appearance from the late Johnny Cash to be found in the hauntingly touching \\"The Wanderer.\\"<br /><br />I can now even say some good things about some of the other tracks on this CD, which is something I didn't do the first time around.  \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\" is full of yearning heartache, \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\" will pound your senses on all eight rock 'n' roll cylinders, and the fun and catchy melodies and lyrics in \\"Babyface\\" and \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\" allow the listener to take a soothing break from the frenzied chaos of the rest of the album.<br /><br />At this point, there's actually very little about this album that I *don't* like.  Take \\"Numb,\\" for example.  It's really kind of a neat song, but its robotic personality and mumbled lyrics has a tendency to sometimes annoy me.  \\"Some Days\\" is a great track, but in my opinion a better effort should have been put forth into providing its guitar solo.  Still, these minor problems don't ruin the fact that this is a fine compilation of futuristic pop music.<br /><br />I will say it again, though: This is the U2 album that leaves you saying to yourself, \\"What the heck?\\"  That, however, is mostly a good thing.  I admit, I'm giving Zooropa four stars -- not five -- but that's only because this album isn't *quite* as epic as some of their other masterpieces like The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.  In addition, one of my original complaints was that some of the material in a way sounds as if it was left over from AB (and my understanding is that there might be some truth to that).  What it amounts to, though, is that with this disc U2 needs to be commended for continuing to evolve a more daring sound and artistic persona, and I no longer feel reluctant to recommend this album to anyone.  Pick it up -- you probably won't regret it.roll cylinders, and the fun and catchy melodies and lyrics in \\"Babyface\\" and \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\" allow the listener to take a soothing break from the frenzied chaos of the rest of the album.

B00005JO9J|5.0|I discovered \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" the same way that I've discovered almost all of my favorite shows - by mistake.  In 2003 when most of my favorite shows closed up shop for the last time, I really didn't think I would stay into television the way I had... But with the help of great shows like \\"Grey's Anatomy,\\" I think I have become more obsessed. <br /> <br />With only 9 episodes in the first season (despite the fact that 13 where filmed), \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" was able to drag viewers in like nothing before... Commanding upwards of 18 million viewers a night right out of the gate, it was a force to be reconded with. <br /> <br />The show follows a group of five surgical interns during there first year of residency, focusing around the character or Meredith Grey (whos mother was the most succeful surgen to ever step foot in that hospital) who has to deal with not only the rigors of her residency, but a complicated love-life, and her mother's alteimzers aswell. <br /> <br />Surrounding Meredith are four other residence, all of whom she shares her home with including: the super model, the angry chinese woman, the dorky geek, and the playboy <br /> <br />\\"Grey's Anatomy\\" which the excpetion of oviously having a single main character is reminiscient of the best years of \\"ER\\" but from right out of the gate.

This is a great novel filled with observations, images and actions carefully stitched into words by a master narrator. If you're a novice to French literature, this is a perfect place to begin.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|I won't write a long review of this film, but I do have a couple of things to say about this film. <br />   This is hands-down, the most amazing Christmas movie, I've ever seen.  There's a consistant sense of wonder, mystery and magic.  The movie makes you smile, thrills you, and amazes you at every turn.  Robert Zemeckis has put together a really superb film, that will become an absolute Christmas classic, and will be cherished by many generations to come. <br />   This is one of the best Christmas films, and one of the best films for children, ever made.  If you loved Matilda, you will know what I mean, when I say that this film makes you feel like a kid, all over again.
1591396190|4.0|This book forces you to challenge how you've defined your customers and competition. The concepts are easy to grasp but harder to apply. I did not walk away having redefined my products but I did gain a better appreciation of the assumptions that currently drive the strategy and the risks inherent in this strategy.
B00005JNJV|5.0|People tend to think of comics--and films based off of them-- as things just for kids. Something with bright costumes, lots of violence and explosions. This film proves that comics are no different than any other novel, videogame, or film. You have the good ones (Batman Begins, Batman, and Batman Returns) and the bad ones (Batman Beyond and Batman and Robin).   Batman Begins is one of the best films I have seen that has been based off a comicbook series. The film has a strong storyline, great script, and a very talented cast. You can tell by the quality and detail of the movie that the people involved really cared about this character. I'm glad to have seen a film that brings justice to Batman and his story.   As for portraying Gotham's Dark Knight Bale has brought the character back to life on the screens just as Keaton had for Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns.
B0000028M7|5.0|\\"Them bones\\" is my all-time favourite song. The album is totally worth the money just for this song alone. Others like \\"Angry Chair\\" And \\"Would\\" is just an awesome bonus. Alice in chains deserved an award out of MTV, because I believe this album blows any metallica album out of the water.
B00005JO17|1.0|In one word \\"BAD.\\"  Disney calls this talent?  It doesn't get much worse than this.  No talent and not even close to the original story. I guess if you come from the computer generation of cold creation and you have been starved for real motion picture entertainment and you have a brain cell of a \\"nat\\" then you might enjoy this film. Be safe and buy your kid a real Disney movie meaning before Walt died and before Eisner took over.  Disney has lost all of their true talent.  All i can say is poor Walt......

0307276902|2.0|Like others have expressed here, I question the validity of so many things that Frey claims happened during his stay at a Minnesota treatment center, not the least of which was the constant breaking of the rules without consequence to the author.   When two facility employees actually take Frey off the campus many miles away to retrieve another patient who left, my head was shaking back and forth through the entire chapter.  I don't believe that would ever happen.  I'm shocked that it did. <br /> <br />I did gain a small degree of insight into addictions and the addicted personality; how valid those insights are is questionable in my mind, however. <br /> <br />One other point is that the grammar (or lack thereof) in this book was extremely distracting to me.  Periods and commas actually *are* necessary to enable the reader to quickly and effectively grasp the information being conveyed.  I had to reread a fair number of sentences in order to understand them. The excessive and unnecessary capitalization of all kinds of words that don't need capitalization further distracted me.  It's too bad that Frey didn't hire himself a very good editor to edit this book.  Of course, in that process it would have lost a bit of its flavor, but for me, it would have been a worthwhile tradeoff. <br /> <br />All in all, it's not the worst book I've read, but it's far from the best.  My advice is borrow a copy or wait till you can purchase it used at half.com or here. <br /> <br />I also agree with other reviewers that Oprah's Book Club stamp on this book will translate into lots and lots and LOTS of dollars for the author, some of which I hope finds its way into charities and foundations that help those struggling today with their addictions, especially since Frey's treatment was paid for in that manner (something I missed in the book but was alluded to by another reviewer).  Pollyanna, I know, but . . .
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses Of The Holy (1973.), Led Zeppelin's fifth studio album<br /><br />In the early 1970's, Led Zeppelin were at their peak. Led Zeppelin were one of the top established bands in the world by the time of the release of 'Houses Of The Holy' in Spring 1973. This was due to the release of four magnificent albums, displaying music from groundbreaking blues hard rock songs to acoustic masterpieces. However, it was mostly in the release of their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV, that the band really sored to superstardom. Songs like 'Stairway To Heaven', which quickly became a generational rock anthem and other great songs made Led Zeppelin IV the band's best sounding album to date. As a result, the band faced the dilemma of making the follow up to a hard rock masterpiece. Scaling to the heights of Led Zeppelin IV seemed impossible; so were the band able to pull it off with 'Houses Of The Holy'?<br /><br />Many will disagree with me but in my opinion, Led Zeppelin's finest hour came with this album. Furthermore, I would go as far to say this is rock music's finest hour of the 70's. So why do you ask? How is HOTH better than albums like Led Zeppelin II or IV? Where are the tracks that better 'Stairway', 'When The Levee Breaks' or 'Whole Lotta Love' for that matter? The answer, for me, lies in how much ground the band covers in this album. This album is the mix of the original rocking Zeppelin, with the new, experimental and more developed band. This album, albeit having only 8 tracks, covers the sounds of funk, reggae, riff rock, synthesizers, acoustics to name but a few. Plus this is all in 40 minutes. I've never heard an album quite like this one. True, it is not as all round consistent as LZ IV but it is in diversity that makes HOTH (the first album the band gave a true name to) a winner of an album. 'Houses Of The Holy' is ingenuity and creativity but at the same time is the band truly enjoying the music their playing and you can sense this in all the albums songs. Plant's vocal range and different styles of delivery are evident through the album, Page's guitar play cleverly changes gears through the album, JP Jones' contribution is invaluable (especially on the keyboard) and Bonham's drumming is first rate. The band opened loads of new avenues in rock music with this album; its impact has been subtle but downright effective. Ironically, the album was released in exactly the same week as Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon'. Two classics like these in one week is staggering and seldom ever seen. The faxt that the band recorded a title track for this album which didn't make it to the final song list shows howe good the work. 'Houses Of The Holy', the song which appears on 'Physical Graffiti', is awesome and the fact that it was deemed too inferior for this album shows the musical quality within. The album will probabaly not strike you as being that great during the first few listens - I personally was disappointed with it at first; but this album gets better and better with repeated listens and the experimetal songs really grow on you.<br /><br />A Led Zeppelin fan favourite, 'The Song Remains The Same' opens the album. This is a 5 minute, upbeat rock song with some amazingly adept guitar work from Page. Plant's high register singing to a fast rhythm works very well. Following this is a true masterpiece and sadly one that often gets underappreciated. 'The Rain Song' is the band's search for a song in the vein of 'Stairway To Heaven'. The slow, mellotron-based melody in this song is awesome. The acoustic sections are moody and the end climax is thrilling, with Plant crying out for 'Just a little rain!' A relaxing song; and it cheers you up on a rainy day too! An acoustic opening follows in 'Over The Hills And Far Away'. The build up into the rocking part of the song is legendary. The song fades out with a dreamy guitar/keyboard section which really cool. Finishing the first half of the album is 'The Crunge'. This is perhaps the mostexperimental song on the album an I personally think it works really well; although some may disagree, finding this track annoying. Plant half sings/half talks on the vocals to a song with a funky beat. Theres a lot going on in this song, so give it plenty of listens; at the least its a funny listen.<br /><br />'Dancing Days' opens the second half of the album. More great riffs from Page supplement some almost chanted Plant vocals. The instrumentals at the end build a great climax and overall the song is a really catchy listen. 'D'yer Mak'er' is next; this is Led Zeppelin successfully experimenting with reggae. The beat is cool and Plant's vocals capture the song style very well. Then we have the next epic of the album; 'No Quarter' is another masterpiece. This is Led Zeppelin's eeriest and most captivating song. Plant's vocals are chilling and give the song a suspicious aura. The song is on of John Paul Jones' finest hours. His keyboard/synth part is awesome and captures the nature of the song and his bass solo mid-way through the epic is timeless. After this song fades out, we come to the classic finish with 'The Ocean'. The hard rocking riff to this song is vintage Zeppelin, supplemented by pronounced drumming. This is a very strong finish. The racing guitar section at the end is a great way to end a unique album.<br /><br />There was never an album quite like 'Houses of the Holy' before it and there has never been on like it made since. This is Led Zeppelin at their most creative and able, showing really how genius their music could be. Led Zeppelin IV might be the band's most consistent and popular album, Physical Graffiti might be their epic and Led Zep I and II might be the hard rock gems, but it is in 'Houses Of The Holy' that you have the great band demonstrating their utmost ability and at the same time giving it their greatest passion and energy. It is a sin not to own this album!!!<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10; a classic that rises above the reste album an I personally think it works really well; although some may disagree, finding this track annoying.

B000AA305M|5.0|This is one of the most amazing compostions of music I have ever experienced. As for the copyright, why should that affect your rating of this CD? People giving a one star rating because of the copyright are doing an injustice to this work of art. Every song is amazing in its own right. <br /> <br />1. Alibi - one of the most powerful songs I have every heard. The climax at the end of the song is amazing. <br /> <br />2. The One I Love - Radio hit, kind of safe but still classic David Gray and a good song. <br /> <br />3. Lately - Great song. Simple yet effective. <br /> <br />4. Nos Da Cariad (Goodnight Sweetheart) - Darker song that grew on me the more I listened. The chorus is the high point of the song. <br /> <br />5. Slow Motion - My second favorite song, displays Gray's incredible range. Starts small but builds to become monumental. <br /> <br />6. From Here You Can Almost See The Sea - Reminds me most of older David Gray, eerie chorus and all around good song. <br /> <br />7. Ain't No Love - High point of the album. Instantly became one of my favorite songs of all time. <br /> <br />8. Hospital Food - Upbeat pop song with lyrics that don't quite match the mood of the song. I like the contrast. <br /> <br />9. Now and Always - Interesting intro and decent song, but not my favorite. <br /> <br />10. Dissapearing World - Great way to end the album. Slow song that is another personal favorite. <br /> <br />Go buy this album now if you love good music, or download it legally, because David Gray is one of the last good artists and we need to support him.
0307276902|1.0|I have never been to addiction treatment of any kind but this book just does not have the ring of truth about it.  Some of the reviews on this site have already called into question many of the events depicted, such as the dubious tale about Frey being admitted to the main ward in the treatment center, still woozy and badly injured, being given drugs to help him through withdrawal, and then left unattended for hours on the floor of the TV lounge.  Detox can be a very dangerous and uncomfortable process and I just don't believe that any legitimate treatment center would do such an irresponsible thing.  Having opened his book with such a whopper, Mr. Frey continues with other sensational but unlikely scenarios - drilling of teeth without anesthesia (for no good reason), smashing his furniture, threatening and fighting with other patients, playing cards during lectures, gambling openly, flaunting the rules against fraternization with the females, all without any apparent repercussions.  And then this bad boy is rewarded by being allowed to join in a catered banquet!  Do you have any idea what chaos would erupt if a facility full of ADDICTS was actually run in this fashion?  <br /> <br />One important point that I caught is that Frey didn't have any money and his treatment was being paid for by a grant from the treatment center!  So here's a guy who defies the treatment program, breaks the rules with impunity, intimidates the staff, and its' all ON THE HOUSE!  Do you really think that a treatment center would waste time or money on a guy like this?  Do you really think that they would put up with more that ten minutes of this idiot?  I don't.  There are too many people who WANT to get clean and sober.   <br /> <br />I think that most of the people here who are impressed with this guy are young and/or naive.  The real world just does not work this way.  This book is a fairy tale born of a wild imagination and a gargantuan ego.  This guy (and Oprah) believes his own bs.I don't.  This is a poorly written work of bad fiction.
0446608955|5.0|The book A Walk To Remember is one of the most beautiful love stories ever written. Written with a typical high school setting, Landon Carter the popular \\"stud\\" was running out of time with no date for the Homecoming dance. Jamie Sullivan, the most unpopular preacher's daughter is the only girl left who has not been asked yet to the dance. Although not his first choice, and the fact that he's running out of time, Landon asks Jamie to be his date. She then asks him to participate in the winter play with her, where he first realizes how beautiful she really is. They partake on a journey of falling in love and doing many wonderful things together. Then Jamie shares her big secret with Landon, the fact that she has been fighting cancer for two years and has stopped reacting to treatments. <br /> <br />A movie was made after the book was released following the same story line as the book. There are many comparisons between the book and the movie but three major ideas stand out. The main points differ but still follow the same basic idea. <br /> <br />The first big difference in the book is how Jamie Sullivan and Landon end up talking to one another. In the book Landon is desperate for a date to his homecoming dance and Jamie being the only available girl, he asks her to go with him. In the movie it happens very differently from the very beginning. It starts with Landon and his friends playing a prank on a classmate, but in the process the prank goes bad and the student gets hurt. When the cops show up, all of Landon's friends bail out on him. Leaving him to take the fall and get in trouble. His punishments include participating in the school play, tutoring kids on Saturdays, and helping the janitor after school. <br /> <br />His punishment from the prank leads into the next big difference between the movie and the book. He was made to partake in the schools musical. However, in the book Jamie asks him to participate in the school play with her. <br /> <br />Another comparison between the two is in the book, on Landon and Jamie's journey of falling in love. He willingly goes to the Orphanage with Jamie weekly to volunteer. Although, in the movie he has to do the community service of tutoring on Saturday mornings because of the trouble he got in. Jamie also goes to tutor the children, where they start spending even more time together. <br /> <br />Both the book and movie are first-rate classics. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys a good tear jerking romance. Despite the few major differences between the book and the movie, they were subtle enough to not make it seem like a big change in the story line.  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
076790592X|5.0|I picked up this book during a trying time in our family....my father-in-law is sick in a nursing home and improvment looks bleak.  So, I was a little apprehensive that perhaps this was the wrong time to read this book.  I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />Although bittersweet, because as predicted we lose Morrie in the end, I was greatly uplifted by the fact that this man's spirit was unbreakable.  He is the type that makes lemonade, the best you've ever tasted, out of lemons that are substandard.<br /><br />I truly believe we all have this gift tucked innately within ourselves, but it is a trick to tap into it.  The more we practice, however, the better we get at it---or the more we \\"get it\\" should I say.  Morrie definitely \\"got it\\" and he managed to allow others to see it in themselves as well.<br /><br />Morrie's gift was that of the positive, always looking at the glass as half-full as opposed to half-empty, but not obnoxiously so.....miracuously and infectiously so.  What a delightful man.<br /><br />Mr. Albom wrote a beautiful true story that has captured Morrie's spirit and it will live forever as a result.<br /><br />Wonderful reading.
0060161582|3.0|This little adventure/memoir was written by a native who decided early on that he wanted to be someone else and live in a foreign country, as his life was so dull; he wanted it to be like one of the Technicolor movies we all loved.  As soon as he was old enough to leave the farm behind, he settled in England 'to ride trams and understand strange languages' -- in a land with perpetually drab weather, \\"across the pond\\" 4,000 miles away, not usually sunny and bright.  When in Iowa, he worked as an assistant of a sportscaster at WHO radio where I hear Don Thompson, the erstwhile movie producer, on Sunday mornings.  We had that kind of broadcast on WROL here, as I observed personally one time, while Bill Ross was the gopher.    Ten years later, he returns for a solo motor trip to relive old childhood yearnings and memories, and finds instead of 'home' a foreign country.  \\"I wanted to travel around.  I wanted to see America.  I wanted to come home.\\"  And so he sets out in his mother's old car to see part of the country he had left behind in his youth.  He heads toward Missouri to Hannibal, the home of Mark Twain, but finds it less than he desired.  By this time,  he became disenchanted with his search for the elusive dream of childhood memories as he saw a few occasional Burma Shave signs along the way.    Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri resembled a flatland with corn fields and hardly anything else.  Of course, he bypassed Chicago.   The Mississippi River didn't look as big or majestic as he had remembered it.   In fact, it too was drab and brown, flat and dull like the countryside.  After reaching the Tennessee/Mississippi border, the Mississippi River was broad, dangerous, and deceptively fierce, sometimes overflowing an immense section.    Kentucky had rolling hills and bluegrass, purebred horses, while Jackson, Tennessee, had people who talked funny.  The same in Oxford, Mississippi, so he went on to Tupelo to see the birthplace of Elvis Presley.  He ventured through Oklahoma on the way to Little Big Horn in Montana and Mt. Rushmore.    You'd think that, by now, he would have found some appreciation of his native land.  Instead, he returned to Britain for another ten years before moving to Maine for just a few years.  Some people are just never satisfied.  On the bus yesterday I heard a young mother of three say she hated Tennessee.  I wanted to ask her why she is here then!  I hope that someday Bill Bryson will find his paradise and ideal place.  He might try hiking up to Shangrila in the Himalyans.  That would be quite a feat -- better than coming to the Smoky Mountains and bypassing the hardest and most dangerous of the Appalachian Trail.  I had recommended the Natchez Trace, but he really is not an outdoors person.  Nor am I. He went to Australia instead.  Now, that is a foreign country and they really do talk funny there!
B00001OH7P|2.0|The stage persona of Ziggy is one of the most famous images in rock.  But is this a great album?   <br /> <br />I suggest Hunky Dory, or his tryptich (low/heroes/lodger), or even Scary Monsters.  All have more complex and interesting songs.  Ziggy itself is a great song.  Soul love, Starman have memorable offbeat syncopation with the guitar, but much of Ziggy is done better elsewhere.   <br /> <br />If there was one record of Bowie's to get, this would not be it, though this is probably his most famous work. <br /> <br />It is funny to see how androgynous Bowie was, to say the least, and then suddenly in the macho 1980s he made a big goof of it in interviews.  Rock's Chameleon for you.
B0006FFRVQ|3.0|After so many disappointing CDs, with the slowest tempos and quietest songs ever, all in a row like a funeral dirge, Krall actually acts like a jazz singer at times here, some songs, gasp, actually have noise, and Krall does something besides whisper in ultra quiet mode. This is a very enjoyable album, although not a fabulous one. But the music is fun, and the performances remind you of the early Diana Krall. You know the one who had pretensions of being a jazz artist, not the female version of Mantovani. The flip side of this is a dvd that contains a few music videos, and it forcefully reminds you of Krall's other flaws. Her performance is utterly without personality. Why bother to video such a thing? It reminds me of a surly concert performance she once gave in my city. Enthusiastic fans were appreciative. She barely acknowledged that she was in a room playing for other people. Fans called out some favorites that they wanted her to do. She looked up and sarcastically stated--and it sounded mean, no joking here---\\"What, do you think I have a tip jar here?\\"  Then she realized what she had done and made a half hearted apology. Not a trace of a connection to the audience. Krall is a leaden performer, and it shows on the music videos, which might as well not exist. She's hard pressed to crack a smile. If she has a personality, it is hard to find. Just be satisfied that the music is decent again. About time.
B00005JAVO|5.0|Houses Of The Holy (1973.), Led Zeppelin's fifth studio album<br /><br />In the early 1970's, Led Zeppelin were at their peak. Led Zeppelin were one of the top established bands in the world by the time of the release of 'Houses Of The Holy' in Spring 1973. This was due to the release of four magnificent albums, displaying music from groundbreaking blues hard rock songs to acoustic masterpieces. However, it was mostly in the release of their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV, that the band really sored to superstardom. Songs like 'Stairway To Heaven', which quickly became a generational rock anthem and other great songs made Led Zeppelin IV the band's best sounding album to date. As a result, the band faced the dilemma of making the follow up to a hard rock masterpiece. Scaling to the heights of Led Zeppelin IV seemed impossible; so were the band able to pull it off with 'Houses Of The Holy'?<br /><br />Many will disagree with me but in my opinion, Led Zeppelin's finest hour came with this album. Furthermore, I would go as far to say this is rock music's finest hour of the 70's. So why do you ask? How is HOTH better than albums like Led Zeppelin II or IV? Where are the tracks that better 'Stairway', 'When The Levee Breaks' or 'Whole Lotta Love' for that matter? The answer, for me, lies in how much ground the band covers in this album. This album is the mix of the original rocking Zeppelin, with the new, experimental and more developed band. This album, albeit having only 8 tracks, covers the sounds of funk, reggae, riff rock, synthesizers, acoustics to name but a few. Plus this is all in 40 minutes. I've never heard an album quite like this one. True, it is not as all round consistent as LZ IV but it is in diversity that makes HOTH (the first album the band gave a true name to) a winner of an album. 'Houses Of The Holy' is ingenuity and creativity but at the same time is the band truly enjoying the music their playing and you can sense this in all the albums songs. Plant's vocal range and different styles of delivery are evident through the album, Page's guitar play cleverly changes gears through the album, JP Jones' contribution is invaluable (especially on the keyboard) and Bonham's drumming is first rate. The band opened loads of new avenues in rock music with this album; its impact has been subtle but downright effective. Ironically, the album was released in exactly the same week as Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon'. Two classics like these in one week is staggering and seldom ever seen. The faxt that the band recorded a title track for this album which didn't make it to the final song list shows howe good the work. 'Houses Of The Holy', the song which appears on 'Physical Graffiti', is awesome and the fact that it was deemed too inferior for this album shows the musical quality within. The album will probabaly not strike you as being that great during the first few listens - I personally was disappointed with it at first; but this album gets better and better with repeated listens and the experimetal songs really grow on you.<br /><br />A Led Zeppelin fan favourite, 'The Song Remains The Same' opens the album. This is a 5 minute, upbeat rock song with some amazingly adept guitar work from Page. Plant's high register singing to a fast rhythm works very well. Following this is a true masterpiece and sadly one that often gets underappreciated. 'The Rain Song' is the band's search for a song in the vein of 'Stairway To Heaven'. The slow, mellotron-based melody in this song is awesome. The acoustic sections are moody and the end climax is thrilling, with Plant crying out for 'Just a little rain!' A relaxing song; and it cheers you up on a rainy day too! An acoustic opening follows in 'Over The Hills And Far Away'. The build up into the rocking part of the song is legendary. The song fades out with a dreamy guitar/keyboard section which really cool. Finishing the first half of the album is 'The Crunge'. This is perhaps the mostexperimental song on the album an I personally think it works really well; although some may disagree, finding this track annoying. Plant half sings/half talks on the vocals to a song with a funky beat. Theres a lot going on in this song, so give it plenty of listens; at the least its a funny listen.<br /><br />'Dancing Days' opens the second half of the album. More great riffs from Page supplement some almost chanted Plant vocals. The instrumentals at the end build a great climax and overall the song is a really catchy listen. 'D'yer Mak'er' is next; this is Led Zeppelin successfully experimenting with reggae. The beat is cool and Plant's vocals capture the song style very well. Then we have the next epic of the album; 'No Quarter' is another masterpiece. This is Led Zeppelin's eeriest and most captivating song. Plant's vocals are chilling and give the song a suspicious aura. The song is on of John Paul Jones' finest hours. His keyboard/synth part is awesome and captures the nature of the song and his bass solo mid-way through the epic is timeless. After this song fades out, we come to the classic finish with 'The Ocean'. The hard rocking riff to this song is vintage Zeppelin, supplemented by pronounced drumming. This is a very strong finish. The racing guitar section at the end is a great way to end a unique album.<br /><br />There was never an album quite like 'Houses of the Holy' before it and there has never been on like it made since. This is Led Zeppelin at their most creative and able, showing really how genius their music could be. Led Zeppelin IV might be the band's most consistent and popular album, Physical Graffiti might be their epic and Led Zep I and II might be the hard rock gems, but it is in 'Houses Of The Holy' that you have the great band demonstrating their utmost ability and at the same time giving it their greatest passion and energy. It is a sin not to own this album!!!<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10; a classic that rises above the restthe album an I personally think it works really well; although some may disagree, finding this track annoying.

0790729601|5.0|I'm not going to comment on the story line or plot as that has already been well covered by other reviewers.  <br /> <br />This one was panned by the media critics as too fantastic, unblievable. They missed the point! The whole purpose of this movie is Box Office Success, to make a whole lot of money for the studio by providing pure entertainment, give the public what they want, and expect, from an Arnie adventure flick; and in that they were successful, very successful indeed.  <br /> <br />This film doesn't pretend to be what it is not, serious! It provides action, fantastic adventure and lots comediac fun; you don't have to believe what you see, but you will be entertained and that is the whole point. It's entertainment devorced from reality. Highly recommended. The 5 stars are for entertainment.

B000068CNX|5.0|Friends was a great shows, but of all the seasons this one is among the very best. Funny episodes, funny actors, even better than the first.
B00097DXZS|3.0|OK, Supernatural was a hit so let's milk it for all it's worth. Enough already !<br /><br />I love Santana, but there was a time when there was a difference between the group and the man. There were Santana albums and then there were Carlos Santana albums. That distinction is gone. Just team Carlos up with other artists and turn out another CD.<br /><br />At least if that's the formula let's make it good pairings.<br /><br />This CD is okay but I expect more from Santana.<br /><br />The best cut is I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love, but that's a Los Lonley Boys song guesting Carlos Santana. I want some Santana songs. Where is the next Jingo, or Soul Sacrifice, or Persuasion, or Samba Pa Ti, or Europa, or even Dance Sister Dance.<br /><br />As I have said before bad Santana is better than no Santana or even the majority of other crap produced these days. But please don't tell me this is all that you are Carlos.<br /><br />If you have to keep teaming up with people then take a suggestion: make the next pairing with Gregg Rolie, Michael Shrieve, Michael Carabello, Jose \\"Chepito\\" Areas, Neal Schon, and Alphonso Johnson.<br /><br />Get it?
0553801503|5.0|I blew through this book in less than 3 days thanks to a rather slow moving conference and long flights. It is excellent, the writing is on par with earlier books in the series. Even the most peripheral character feels fleshed out and a \\"real\\" person. I'm sure most are aware by now that this is half of the \\"story\\", focusing on events around the Lannisters, Brienne, Arya, Sansa, and Sam with almost total exclusion of Jon Snow, Tyrion, Stannis, and Daenerys. The story focusing on them, taking place in the same timeframe, will be in another book. <br /> <br />Since Kingsport and the struggle to reunite Westeros is the focus, this book is VERY politcal, there are almost no battles, little or no magic, and no significant elaboration of where GRRM wants to go with the plot. What it does do is massively fill out much of the political landscape and show just how important the recently deceased were to stability. Westeros feels like it is ready to implode even more so than when open war ravaged the land. <br /> <br />Due to the lack of massed battles it appears that not much is happening, and indeed few characters reunite or significantly alter their situations until the very end. But GRRMs lively writing and vivid descriptions of the world keep even tedious council meetings interesting. I happen to like Brienne and Sam, so their stories were fun for me. Fans of Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion (my personal favorite) will have to wait though, as they are referenced only briefly. <br /> <br />As a side note, at one time there was a review that stated this book would take place 5 years after the first three. This is incorrect, as AFOCs starts off immediately after the last book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Saw the play in Denver and loved it ALL. And the soundtrack brings it all back and in repeated hearings you get the nuances of the lyrics and the music that you only get the quickest blush for when hearing it on stage. Stephen Shwartz is amazing! As are all the lead actors/singers. Both Chenoweth and Menzel SOAR! What a masterpiece.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I don't have a clue what Firefly is.. at least when I saw this movie I didn't.  My boyfriend hauled me to this one and I am really glad he did.  I was expecting the same old tired lightsabers and warp drive standard fare.  What I got was something totally different.  There was a distinct western flavor to this movie.  The characters were all fun to watch and the dialog was fresh and different.  I very much enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br />I was surprised that I hadn't heard about this before.  Too bad the movie studio didn't advertise it more.  Nobody I have talked to about this movie even knew what it was.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I am a fan of 'Like a Virgin' like Jesus Christ was a good man. I live for this album. I will be buried with this album. I have listened to this album at least three times a day for 22 years. The original release date of this album is my Christmas. I live only to listen to this album and worship the young Madonna who made it all possible. If only it was still the early eighties, if only I still had dreams that had a chance of coming true, if only my young Madonna would know who I am. I have broken down these songs with descriptions for you, kind reader. My words fall flat at accurately describing these wonderful songs, but I have done my best...<br /><br />1. Material Girl - Ah, Madonna personifies the 80's attitude. Notice when the male chorus comes in how they sound like mindless robots. They have been stripped of their souls by the almighty dollar. This is Reaganomics at its best. Madonna knows true love will come one day, but she'll be rich and have fun along the way.<br /><br />2. Angel - Oh how many times I rewound this song on my tapedeck late at night while I was in bed and the rest of the house was sleeping. Madonna's angelic voice makes this song so wonderful. \\"Oooooh...You're an Angel.\\" I would play and sing this song all night until Madonna's sweet voice lulled me to sleep. The greatest thing I could imagine was for Madonna to slowly fly through my window and hover above me all in white while she sang this song to me.<br /><br />3. Like A Virgin - No other title track in the history of music has ever equalled this. Like a Virgin is not only the world's most celebrated pop song, it is the best pop song. I used to dance behind a locked door in my bathroom while wearing my mother's underwear listening to this.<br /><br />4. Over And Over - Madonna really lets loose on this one. It's a happy song that makes you oh so happy to be young and alive.<br /><br />5. Love Don't Live Here Anymore - Some would disagree, but I find this song to be the jewel of Madonna's entire career. The desperation in her voice has brought tears to my eyes while listening. How could anyone ever do this to our dear Madonna? Oh if only I had been Sean Penn in the 80's. I would have been her knight and she would have been the most beautiful damsel. I cannot write anymore about this song, I'm crying now and I have to finish this review.<br /><br />6. Dress You Up - Custom suits made in London may be what dreams are made of. Madonna again gives us a pop attack that just will not let up. No matter how bad of a day I've had, or whatever the world throws at me, I fight back. I just hum 'Dress you Up' to myself and all my troubles go away. Its worked everytime for 22 years.<br /><br />7. Shoo-Bee-Doo - Another beautiful song that makes me cry. I always imagained Madonna singing this to me as I sat in my dark closet. This song prevented me from commiting suicide at least 15 times. I would stare at the 'Like a Virgin' album cover and sing 'Shoo be doo be doo baby' as I kissed her photo.<br /><br />8. Pretender - If there is one thing Madonna cannot stand or tolerate is posers. I have always lived my life so that Madonna could never accuse me of being a Pretender. I take this song religiously, because I know that one day Madonna will judge me and decide my fate in the hereafter. My only goal in life is to hear her say \\"You have done well\\".<br /><br />9. Stay - A great closer and a wonderful new beginning to an album. After Madonna pleads 'Stay Stay please Stay Darling\\", how can you help but turn the record back over and listen to it again? If my life worked out the way I wanted to, I could have just spent my entire life locked up in a room listening to this album 'Over and Over again' with no worries, no responsibilities, and no problems.<br /><br />Dear reader, as you finish this review, imagine me dancing and twirling away on a winding mist of crisp air while Madonna sings enchantedly in my heart and yours.jewel of Madonna's entire career.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|A bit into commericalism. A movie about how several survivors box themselves up in a shopping mall to wait out the pending horror that is going on outside the mall's wall, i.e. Zombies.  A must see film for anyone who enjoys watching horror movies.  A classic film.
0790729393|1.0|Before I begin, let me state that in no way do I condone child abuse nor do I excuse adults who sexually victimize children.  But neither do I condone vigilante-style justice.  This author of the book and the makers of this film seem to be of the opinion that sexual predators deserve to die a violent death, and that their killers should be allowed to get away with it.  The picture disturbed me greatly for its lack of a sense of true justice, as well as the cheap exploitation and ignorance that the script espoused.  I couldn't have been more shocked if this film had condoned mob lynching, genocide, serial killing - or child abuse, for that matter.  Morally wrong is morally wrong, and the defense of vigilantism is morally wrong.<br /><br />Some people continue to insist that this film is based on a \\"true story\\" even though the author has never presented credible evidence that it's based on fact.  Some have suggested that this was a matter of publicity seeking, but I believe that his insistence that it's based on truth is merely a way of lending its unbelievable plot line more credibility.  In this film, Kevin Bacon plays a low-life security guard in a Catholic reform school.  He and two other guards routinely victimize and intimidate their young charges, forcing themselves on teenage boys in horrendous acts of sexual abuse.  Years later, one of their victims spots the Kevin Bacon character in a restaurant and shoots him dead in cold blood.  Unfortunately, there's nothing unbelievable about the plot up to this point.  Child abusers do exist, and people do kill for revenge.  It's what follows next that is so incredible.<br /><br />The murder is followed by a cover-up at all levels to protect the murderer.  We are asked to believe that, in order to exonerate a killer - a GUILTY killer - a Catholic priest would lie under oath and a prosecutor would throw a capitol murder case, all on the basis of the idea that the \\"fag\\" child molester got what was coming to him.  Of course, most well-read and enlightened people know that sexual predators who victimize children are almost always heterosexual.  And although there is no indication in the film that the Kevin Bacon character is homosexual, many people (probably a majority of people in the US) still wrongly believe that most gay men are child abusers and most child abusers are gay.  I believe that this homophobic reasoning underlies the author's conviction that the murderer is justified in his actions; this opinion is further underscored by the fact that the mood of the film when the killer is acquitted is nothing less than celebratory.  I also believe that it's one reason why so many people think that a movie in which someone literally gets away with murder is a \\"great\\" film.<br /><br />For me, this picture was bad in a dozen different ways that I found offensive - the storyline reflects bad logic, bad judgment, bad justice, bad morals, bad lessons and bad drama.  All combined, this film annoyed me from the first scene forward.  The conclusion that murder can be justified struck me as absolutely barbarian, and I was flabbergasted at the fact that such a distinguished group of fine actors would lend their skills to this bigoted, puerile garbage.  The more I watched, the more I got the impression that this film, and the book it was based on, was created only to please homophobic adolescents.  If you are the sort of ignorant Neanderthal who would think it's OK to commit murder as long as you're blowing away a \\"sexual deviate\\", then this film is for you.  If you further believe that murder in the name of revenge is not only defensible but perfectly just, then you will find this film rewarding.<br /><br />With all the talk in the news these days about sex abuse victims coming forward to accuse their tormentors, I would have liked this film much more if the boys had simply banded together and accused Bacon and the other guards of the abuse, bringing charges in adulthood for what they sufferedas adolescents.  Surely if real life victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests can find relief though genuine legal means and have their accusations believed (as so many have done) why not the teens depicted here?  A far more satisfying ending would have been for Kevin Bacon (and his cohorts, who escaped any retribution at all, including the vigilante killing) to receive exposure and proper legal punishment.t they suffered as adolescents.

1573223026|3.0|I suppose I should say that I'm one of those who became a huge Hornby fan from Fever Pitch on, running out to buy each new book the day it came out. This latest novel is definitely one that I could have waited on paperback for. It's not bad, it's just not as good as one is used to getting from Hornby. The premise it's built around is one of those high-concept one-liners that one finds around Hollywood: four strangers all intending to commit suicide encounter each other on top of a building on New Year's eve and go on to form an unlikely support group. The story unfolds in first-person narrative through the alternating very different voices of the foursome. This narrative method tends to mess with the book's pace, as a story starts with one character, only to be ended by another. However, the main problem is that the four characters are all rather thin -- more archetypes than actual living, breathing people a reader can engage with and believe in.<br /><br />There's Martin, a 40ish morning TV host who's managed to throw away his comfortable house and family by being caught having sex with a buxom teenager. He's a kind of standard-issue shallow media type who spends the entire book trying to figure out why he behaves badly. His motivation for suicide is simply that he's lost it all, and can't imagine ever getting it back. There's Jess, an absurdly nasty teenage girl who can't understand why she just got dumped and more importantly, can't understand why her big sister disappeared. She spends the entire book being outrageously cruel to everyone she meets, while simultaneously acting as the crazy glue that keeps the foursome from drifting apart. She's so completely over the top and shallow that one is forced to speculate whether Hornby has aged (or matured) to the point where he's lost touch with the younger generation. Almost equally shallow is pizza-deliverer JJ, an American whose critically acclaimed, but unpopular band just broke up, and whose English girlfriend has left him. His function in the book is to act as a kind of soothing balm between the others, and yet the solution to his suicidal pain is so strikingly obvious (start a new band, der!) that his presence feels constantly unnecessary. The best character of all is the one who is probably closest to Hornby's heart, middle-aged shut-in Maureen, who's spent her entire adult life caring for her mentally catatonic son. As many of Hornby's readers know, he's got an autistic son, and one can see the empathy of direct experience seeping into the passages written from Maureen's perspective.<br /><br />It's to Hornby's credit that the book remains as readable as it is, given the weak characters and stop-and-go narration. Hornby remains a very fluid writer, even when the dialogue is barely credible, he manages to keep the reader engaged. Still, there's a kind of internal tension to the whole thing -- because as much as Hornby tries to avoid easy answers and even easier platitudes, the book slips right into them. The whole notion of \\"there's always someone worse off than you\\" pervades the gang of four, and is stamped with an exclamation point by an African cab driver whose own personal tragedy makes them shamefaced. Another running notion is that not every problem can be met and conquered with a little therapy and will, and yet by the end of the book that's more or less what each one is in the process of doing. And despite Marin's continual disparagement of Jess for looking to the movies for solutions, the book sure is cinematic. In fact, I would not at all be surprised if this made a much better movie than book.<br /><br />If you're a big Hornby fan, you'll probably enjoy this one, and if you're not, it's unlikely to win you over. Even at his most mediocre, he's more entertaining than 99% of writers and if nothing else, the book has plenty of funny bits. My own favorite is when, after having abandoned getting together to discuss books by suicidal authors, they get together to discuss music by suicidal musicians. After JJ plays some Nick Drake, Martin and Jess dismissivly shrug it off, leading to the following reaction from JJ: \\"I wondered whether it would be possible to punch both of them out simultaneously, but rejected the idea on the grounds that it would all be over too quickly, and there wouldn't be enough pain involved. I'd want to keep pummeling them after they were down, which would mean doing them one at a time.\\"r to discuss music by suicidal musicians.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I was not an original fan of \\"Firefly.\\" In fact, I did not TRULY get into the series until earlier this year, when Sci-Fi reaired the series in full.<br /><br />Soon after, though, I discovered that a movie was to be released.<br /><br />I saw this movie.<br /><br />And I was blown away.<br /><br />The essence of \\"Firefly\\" is captured in this film. This blend of action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, and Western doesn't lose anything from the series (well..it does, but to say what would be spoiling the film for those that haven't seen it).<br /><br />Wonderful CGI and camerawork. Same acting you're used to. Better character development on many of the characters you've come to love.<br /><br />I'm strapped in waiting for a possible sequel.<br /><br />See this film. Buy this film. Love this film.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|When I was five it was 1963 and I lived in the most beautiful countryside imaginable on the edge of a forest deep in southern Sussex.  The winter was cold, deep drifting snow and crisp, sometimes biting north winds.  The summer though was hot, filled with bees, birds, open windows and perfect flowers.  At this age I began to love music.  First came the Beatles - along with Elvis, Ella and Sinatra singing \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\".  The soundscape to a perfect, childish year that saw my journey truly begin.  <br /> <br />As I grew older, the Beatles blossomed into a rich, verdant orchard that fed those days and shaped a new world as Beach Boys singles sang out from a million grateful juke boxes.  Cream, Hendrix, Dylan, Yes, Cohen, Joni, Crosby and Wyatt soon followed - then came the pulse of Jazz fusion - Miles Davis, Weather Report, Mahavishnu/Shakti, Oregon - then ECM wrapped a cool but incredibly beautiful wind around us: Jan Garbarek, Eberhard Weber, Keith Jarrett and a family of friends to name just a few.  Expansion, progression, experimentation, new horizons, soul food and spiritual highs were widely available in many a darkened room, bursting behind closed eyelids and the soft, warm breath of lovers.  <br /> <br />Then came the antidote.  It wasn't really required by true musos - it was just that a frustrated mainstream music media hadn't looked much beyond the album charts to find new champions.  Instead of punk/wave remaining on its natural edge where it would surely flourish, it was kicked down the throats of the masses by media hysteria - straight into the misunderstanding of golden brown mainstream. Some of the new wave too soon proved itself truly great and timeless - Pistols, Clash, Talking Heads, XTC and on and on it rolled on and on, through The Smiths, Throwing Muses, My Bloody Valentine, Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Pearl Jam, early Verve, Bjork, Radiohead with many of the aforementioned - and probably a couple of hundred more - still breathing new life into the ever turning seasons.  Many of you will know exactly what I mean and many of you reading this will know exactly where I'm going.  We all need something new - something that pushes the waves back yet manages to wash over us as we feel the goosebumps rise and the braingasm begin.  Sigur Ros are part of this evolution.  All of their albums have blissful, deeply evocative, moving moments.  Takk brings them to a new level.  This album isn't just worth five stars - it is like all of the artists above - it is so precious - not only to music per se but as a measure of all that is positive in human development.  How are some humans this good?  Simple notes that have been available since time began.  How are we fortunate enough to have had them find us and lead us into the secret world that they and their ilk inhabit?  If this is your first time in their world, think yourself lucky - you just got pulled through. <br /> <br />I will only mention one track - Svo Hljott.  I am five again and living in the most beautiful countryside imaginable on the edge of a forest in southern Sussex.  The window is open yet November is all around me and the fragrant scent of roses tip-toes in between my closing eyelids; but sleep is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br />
B00005JO1G|3.0|Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal, \\"Proof\\", \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\") is quickly assigned to C Company upon his arrival at the Marine base. Entering the barracks, he finds other Marines struggling to use a homemade USMC brand on a guy's leg. After they finish, they move on to Swoff. Struggling, he passes out as the brand approaches his flesh. When he wakes up, Troy (Peter Saarsgard) explains that he has to earn the brand; the whole thing was a show, for his benefit. Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) picks Swoff and Troy for sniper duty and they begin to train and bond. Shortly after they finish training, Operation Desert Shield begins and they ship out to Saudi Arabia. Eager for action, they quickly become bored sitting in the desert, waiting for some guns to go off.<br /><br />Director Sam Mendes' follow-up to \\"American Beauty\\", \\"Jarhead\\" is a film with high expectations that it ultimately fails to meet. It wants to be the next \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" or \\"Platoon\\" but lacks the key ingredients to get there.<br /><br />A friend told me that she saw the film as well and liked it because it really captured the experience of going to war, ready to defend the country, and then sitting around waiting for something to happen. She was in the Army for a while and can attest to the accuracy of that part of the film. I can't.<br /><br />What I can do is evaluate if the film works from a narrative and dramatic point of view. It does and it doesn't.<br /><br />The film quickly and efficiently establishes Swoff through a series of brief flashbacks and some voice over narration. We learn that Swoff had a screwed up childhood, but we don't really understand why he would join the Marines. His dad was in Vietnam and we quickly learn that this screwed up his family life. So why would that make Swoff interested in joining the military? It would seem to accomplish just the opposite.<br /><br />Once he arrives at the Marine base, the film becomes a series of scenes that we have seen in other, better films about the military; the abusive drill sergeant, the humiliation of a new recruit, the hard training. After the film moves to the desert, we meet Swoff's buddies in more detail. Again, characters from other, better war films; the joker, the earnest guy who wears glasses and listens to tapes from his family, the family man excited about the birth of his new child, the two Latino men who fight over the differences between their cultures.  \\"Jarhead\\" can't really be faulted for including these, because we expect that they will be here. And these scenes are done well. They just don't offer anything new.<br /><br />Once they set out for the desert, the film begins to push the envelope a little, introducing some elements that we haven't seen before. Mendes manages to convey what it was like to sit in the desert and wait, and wait, and wait. But what about this would make it interesting or compelling to an audience? The characters. And this is where the film falls short. Swoff has to deal with the same feelings that all of the men in his company have to deal with. They begin to suspect that their girlfriends and wives are cheating on them which leads Swoff to begin to suspect his relationship with the `girl back home', as he pays daily visits to a bulletin board covered with pictures of the cheating spouses.  One day, she sends the t-shirt featured prominently in a sexy photo back to him. So we get that. We get that he is jealous and unsure of his relationship and unhappy. What we don't get is the reason why he starts to act crazy. It's almost as though there is a scene missing in the development of this trait. One moment, he is bored and anxious about his relationship. The next he's buying homemade alcohol and dancing around wearing nothing but two Santa caps, one of which is on his head.<br /><br />There is also supposed to be a relationship between Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Troy (Peter Saarsgard), the two central characters, we are supposed to live this experiencethrough them. Troy is Swoff's buddy, confident and partner, the guy who `has his back'. In one scene, Troy helps Swoff deal with an issue, but that is about it. There is a scene, late in the film, which is supposed to be the `grand moving moment', showing us how important their relationship has become. It comes off as hollow and formulaic.<br /><br />All of the production's physical elements are there. The cinematography is beautiful and evocative. The setting is perfect. The editing is great. There are small artistic flourishes throughout that add to the story, without detracting from it. But the narrative elements are lacking.<br /><br />In addition to a lack of character development, the film doesn't really take a stance for or against the war. In one scene, Swoff and all of his buddies are watching \\"Apocalypse Now\\", cheering when the helicopters begin to attack the small village on the beach. I'm sure this is the message Coppola intended for this scene, for this film. In another scene, Kruger (Lucas Black, \\"Sling Blade\\", \\"Friday Night Lights\\"), one of Swoff's tent mates, begins talking about how the war is being fought for oil, etc. The message is mixed, or non-existent. Why is this important? Because if the film doesn't take a stand, one way or another, why should we even watch the film?<br /><br />To see the relationship between the characters? It is superficial, at best. So, no.<br /><br />To watch the great action scenes and/ or battles. Not here. Sorry.<br /><br />To watch the acting. Maybe.

B000062YB1|5.0|Slayer, part of the big four of thrash, is one of the most influential and innovative thrash metal bands around, and had increased their popularity in 1986 by creating one of the best metal albums ever (along with \\"Master of Puppets\\"), \\"Reign In Blood\\". That album was an absolute masterpeice. Then in 1988, Slayer came out with \\"South of Heaven\\", which was a more complex album. It had slower songs, mixed with tons more atmosphere, more organized song structures, and for the most part, worked and satisfied fans everywhere. Now \\"Seasons In the Abyss\\" combines their thrash heaviness found in \\"Reign In Blood\\" with the organized, yet still complex song structures found in \\"South of Heaven\\", and is actually my favorite album.    First off, I still love the more thrashy songs like \\"Hallowed Point\\", \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Born of Fire\\", but I also love the fact that Slayer decided to go more  progressive and bring more to the music than just dual shredding, all-over-the-place guitars. The guitars are still complex enough to leave you amazed, the drumming is extremely good (obviously, its Dave Lombardo, people), and the lyrics don't suck either. Some fans of vintage Slayer are extremely critical of this album and call it a new Slayer, and that it sucks, but this album does not suck and is in fact, a better Slayer.     So, hows about some musicianship criticism right about now? Ok, here I go: Tom Araya (Bass, Vocals, Lyrics) - As a lyric writer paired with Kerry King, Tom always manages to write about some dark and gritty stuff not expected out of a thrash metal band, but rather a death metal band. Who cares though? I love the lyrics and it fits the atmosphere of the music quite well. The vocals are a bit dry, and Tom sometimes sounds like he is struggling to pull off the screams. He's no Freddie Mercury, but he's better than most vocalists I've heard. Oh yeah, the bass? I don't hear any bass. I'm sure he's pretty good though, he has his own signature bass guitar, if that counts for anything. Kerry King (Guitar, Lyrics) - Obviously the better of the two guitarists. He is fast, accurate, but he seems to love to make the guitar screech using the whammy bar a bit too much. Overall, a quite solid player, and better than Hanneman. Jeff Hanneman (Guitar) - His solos are good, but Kerry Kings is so much more precise and complex, he kind of leaves Jeff in the dust. Once again, a solid player. Dave Lombardo (Drums) - Honestly the most talented member of the band. He was also the co-creator of Slayer anyway. Between his double bass kicks and attraction to off-beat drumming and crazy fills (and his overuse of the ride cymbal), I find myself struggling to comprehend what a great player he is. I am currently myself struggling to learn \\"War Ensemble\\". Its f**king hard!     Now for the songs:    1.\\"War Ensemble\\" - A thrash classic. Possibly one of the best on the whole album. Its also got one of the greatest overall drum performances ever, and like I said, is f**king hard. (10/10)    2.\\"Blood Red\\" - A slow but short song. I guess the length is not that big of a problem though, since if this song were 6-8 minutes, it would get boring. Pretty good. (9/10)    3.\\"Spirit In Black\\" - Love the lyrics. Another very slow song, but I like it. It surely isn't like a \\"Reign In Blood\\" song, but its decent. (7/10)    4.\\"Ependable Youth\\" - Its got some interesting lyrics, but the song itself is not that bad. It just feels so... so... boring, I guess, is the only way to put it. Kind of a filler song. (6/10)    5.\\"Dead Skin Mask\\" - I know what the songs about, and I love it. Its about a wierd murderer (and I use the term \\"wierd\\" very lightly)who cuts off peoples faces and wears them as masks. Why Slayer would choose to write a song about this-I don't know. But its a great song. (9.5/10)    6.\\"Hallowed Point\\" - If the whole album had been like \\"Spirit In Black\\", it would have been very boring. However, here is the first song that they revisit their thrash roots. This song isgood enough to have actually been a \\"Reign In Blood\\" song. Great drumming, of course. (10/10)    7.\\"Skeletons of Society\\" - Slow song, but this is the best slow song on here. It has so much depth to it, it just doesn't leave your head when you hear it. Good lyrics too. (10/10)    8.\\"Temptation\\" - Another \\"Reign In Blood\\" sounding song. Great track. one of my favorites. (9/10)    9.\\"Born of Fire\\" - Possibly the worst \\"Reign In Blood\\" sounding song, but still above decent. (10/10)    10.\\"Seasons In The Abyss\\" - My most favorite track on the album. Combines evil sounding guitars, crazy drumming (well, at the beginning anyway), and great lyrics. Nearly flawless. And at 6:32, its the longest Slayer song ever recorded (At least that I know of). (10/10)    Overall: (90.5/100)-Decent score, not too bad. Definately SOME filler material though.    Highly recommended for fans of Slayer and/or thrash metal.
B00005JO17|3.0|Adults ** ½<br /><br />Children ****<br /><br />Chicken Little (Zach Braff, \\"Garden State\\", TV's \\"Scrubs\\") creates a stir in the town of Oakey Oaks when he begins ringing the school bell, yelling \\"The sky is falling, the sky is falling.\\" After the animal residents run amuck, they eventually realize everything is calm and Chicken Little becomes the town laughing stock. A year later, the movie has just been released and it seems Chicken Little will never live it down. Little is also upset because his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) never believed him and still doesn't, causing issues within the family. His friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), aka the Ugly Duckling, Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), and Fish Out Of Water have all stuck by him and rally around when another chunk of sky falls on his head and the aliens invade.<br /><br />\\"Chicken Little\\", the newest digital animation effort from Disney, is a step in the right direction for the struggling animation company. Okay, maybe a baby step, but it is a step nonetheless. It isn't Pixar quality, but better than a lot of competing studio's efforts (\\"Robots\\") and even Disney's last few non-Pixar efforts.<br /><br />The animation is decidedly stylized. Everything seems designed to resemble storybook illustrations; body parts are exaggerated or stylized, settings are quaint, vehicles are rounded and bubble like. Chicken Little and his dad live in a large home that looks like a chicken coop. This step away from attempting to make animation more realistic is interesting and a good idea, allowing the filmmakers more creative license, giving them free reign to create a world where Turkey Lurkey (Don Knotts) is the mayor and a bull runs the china shop.<br /><br />Despite stepping away from realism, the use of computer animation has advanced so much that the filmmakers are able to cover Little with realistic, albeit small, feathers. All of the animals are covered with hair or feathers that would make any creature realistic, if the proportions were a little more realistic.<br /><br />At the same time, this stylized animation seems ripe with merchandizing possibilities. Stuffed animals, theme park characters and more are sure to be born if the movie is successful. I realize that Disney is always trying to exploit all of their movie characters for these other revenue streams, but this is the first time I have felt like the characters were designed for these avenues first. Because it seems like everything was designed for commercial value, it detracts from the magic of watching these cute characters romping around on the screen.<br /><br />The first and last twenty minutes of the film are very fast paced. The introduction of all of the characters, as Little runs a virtual obstacle course to get to school and deal with the scorn of his classmates, including Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris) and the finale depicting Little, his dad, and his loyal friends, saving the town, are fast paced and fun to watch. Because these two segments move so fast, it seems a bit like being on a roller coaster at Disneyland. You know there are faster roller coasters out there, but this roller coaster will give you a couple of minutes of excitement. In the middle of the day, you move on to other rides that the little kids love before maybe squeezing in another thrill ride before the end of your day.<br /><br />The middle of the film, when the story kicks in, is very slow. It's not enough that Chicken Little has to deal with the scorn of his classmates and the other animals living in Oakey Oaks, he has to deal with the shame of his father. Once a great baseball hero in the town, his father is ashamed that his son has created so much excitement, for no reason. This leads Little to join the baseball team, even though he can't even lift the bat. All season, he sits on the bench, waiting for his turn at bat. Then... Wait, a minute, what part does this whole thing play in the remainder of the film? It doesn't. It simply servesas filler, to make the film over an hour long, for viable theatrical distribution. The middle slows everything way, way down.<br /><br />The voice acting is good, but not brilliant. Zach Braff manages to convince us that his character is a small, little guy, who can become heroic when necessary. Joan Cusack and Steve Zahn are amusing as his sidekicks. Patrick Stewart, Wallace Shawn, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Patrick Warburton and Adam West all voice smaller, supporting characters, adding to the fun.<br /><br />Because of the stylized animation and the bright colors, the film is very \\"cute\\". Maybe too cutesy-pie for adults. Disney films used to have a lot of jokes and visual puns that only the adults would get, to keep them interested while they were doing their good parental duty and taking the kids to a film they could enjoy. Recent Disney efforts have lacked this element, making it a necessary chore for parents to sit through the barrage of brightly animated images as their kids squeal and laugh. \\"Chicken\\" has little to keep the adults interested.<br /><br />You can always tell when an animated film will transcend the genre and become a remembered, beloved classic. Adults without kids go to the film and laugh more than the children in the audience. \\"Chicken Little\\" won't be a classic, but your younger kids will enjoy it.

B0001AP12G|5.0|It seems that the only good out rapper out there is Kanye West, because Eminem only writes dumb crass tracks (My First Single A**ike that) and 50 cent writes about how rich he is and how poor you are.<br /><br />This is how rap music... should sound like.<br /><br />He writes about his confrontations with the demons inside him, his relationships, plus he has a great rap voice.<br /><br />Usually I hate rap (except K-Os) but this is some good rap for a change.<br /><br />Plus this CD is great too! full of great bouncy and catchy rap, anyone will like this!<br /><br />5/5
B0009RCPY8|4.0|Amusing classic.  Nothing deep, just some laughs from the 80s that the whole family can watch.
B0001CCXY8|2.0|CC is the posterchild of death metal which is unfortunate because they are really not that good.  This album especially can not keep up with the other techdeath bands that are out there today.  I enjoyed Bloodthirst and the Bleeding at one time.  This album seems like a detachment from intense death metal and more about riding on the CC gimmick. <br /> <br />Problem 1:  They rely too heavily on the gore subject, its just goofy.  I wonder what they tell their kids. <br /> <br />Problem 2:  The drummer really sucks.  His blast beats are really slow and simple and do not hold up at all to a current techdeath drummers.  In fact he doesnt really blast at all on this album (might be a good thing hahah).  Not only that I saw them live and the Paul Mauriskcez or whatever his name is plays completely wrong, I'm surprised he doesnt get carpal tunnel. <br /> <br />Problem 3: The guitar work is fast and thats about it.  With the exception of some riffs, most just sound like random notes.  I know death metal relies on weird and chromatic scales, but i often get the impression the guys dont know what theyre doing.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Nickleback my favorite new obsession. Its soft rock, its hard rock a little bluesy, a little Texasy a whole lot of good sounds. <br />The sound resonates early Creed and a bit of Green Day.  I don't know how else to say it, it's just sooo damn good. My favorite, can't get it out of my head cut is 'Figured You Out', nasty, but catchy...Love this CD.
B000A78Z82|1.0|I'm not sure, maybe I just got ripped off, but is there supposed to be only 1 song that is 9 minutes long on the cd?
B000B0WODA|3.0|If you want to see where this type of music came from go check out Gang of Four.  They're a more original group than Franz Ferdinand.  No, I'm not saying Franz Ferdinand is horrible or anything.  There's some catchy pop here.  It's alright but don't fool yourself into thinking they're revolutionary or anything.  Also, I bet you're checking out this page in the first place to find the next big thing.  The future of music, right?  Maybe you should check out Skinny Puppy's Greater Wrong of the Right album instead.  That's the future of music.  Not this.
B00006IU73|5.0|There are no words that can describe how great this album is.  I can't find one thing I don't like about it.  The production is perfect, the writing is fantastic, and every song is great.  I've spun this CD so many times, I'm surprised it still works.  If you like any other Porcupine Tree albums, I promise you'll enjoy this one, too.
B00005JO1G|1.0|Went to see this movie last night expecting a war movie about the US Marine Corp. Instead I saw a movie about a bunch of nut jobs that had escaped from a mental institution. These guys were falling apart before the fighting even began. This was a movie to slam our recent efforts in the Gulf area. It was a slam on the US Marine Corp and it was a slam on the military in general. I will give you all the same advise I sent my son who is in the USMC - do not waste repeat do not waste your money. This was a bunch of junk.
B0007TX894|4.0|After being graced with \\"In Absentia\\", I thought for sure that PT would never come close to topping it.  I figured they had seen their peak and were headed for a downhill.  Surprisingly, I was wrong.  \\"Deadwing\\" may not beat \\"In Absentia\\", but I enjoy it just as much as \\"In Absentia\\".  The only reason why this album doesn't beat \\"In Absentia\\" is because of the style.  \\"Deadwing\\" has a more rockish sound with songs like Shallow and Halo, while \\"In Absentia\\" was more mellow and dreary throughout.   <br /> <br />Some people may like this album more than \\"In Absentia\\" if they want something with the same quality, but a little more rockish and fast-paced.  On the other hand, those who were hypnotized by \\"In Absentia\\" like myself will think \\"Deadwing\\" comes in a not-so-distant second place.  But EITHER WAY, it's a must-have from the Porcupine Tree collection.

WITH YOU THERE TO HELP ME, THE VOLUME SEAMED KIND OF LOW HAD TO TURN IT UP. THATS THE ONLY COMPLAINT. I WANTED A BETTER COPY. SO I ORDERED THE CANADIAN ISSUE. WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT IN SOUND. ALL SONGS WERE LEVEL EXCEPT TEACHER, BUT NO THUMP BASS TO VIBRATE THE FLOOR. NOTHING TO SAY. SOUNDED BETTER AND WITH YOU THERE TO HELP ME WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS THE OTHERS.
0446577383|3.0|I'm a fan of Baldacci and like his writing style but this book was too political.  I prefer my fiction to be more fictional and not heavily based in the news that reading a good book helps escape if only for a few hours.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|First things first- there's an obvious Fall Out Boy reference throughout the entire CD.  They're signed to Pete Wentz's label, the songs have extremely similar lyrical content, and the singer sounds like Patrick Strump.  Thing is, their lyrics are better than FOB's and the singer is much, much better than Strump- more range and, as a previous reviewer alluded to, far superior enunciation.  P!ATD's debut is loaded with potential and is a bit of a fresh sound in the extremely overloaded emo/pop-punk scene.  This is one of the best releases from the emo scene this year (the best by far, of course, being Finch's phenomenal Say Hello To Sunshine). <br /> <br />That's not to say P!ATD is perfect.  One of the biggest problems with this release is the same thing I found in FOB's From Under The Cork Tree, and that's the conflict between being emo and just being depressed about not getting any.  No one really cares that your relationship didn't work, but they care even less than you're sad that you're flying solo at night. <br /> <br />P!ATD is a promising emo/pop-punk band.  The best emo/pop-punk band by far is still Alkaline Trio (recommended: Good Mourning, Goddamnit, self-titled), but if P!ATD cut down some of the lack-of-action garbage, they could easily catch up.  Check this one out if you're looking for a bit of a changeup from the emo/pop-punk scene.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I bought this CD as I searched for Christmas music that wasn't cheesy to play during a holiday cocktail party. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it - especially because of what was not on the recording, namely the trumpet falsetto horse sound on Sleigh Ride.  Just smooth and sexy background music appropriate for singles in the city.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|If popular music is your compass, your religion (and for better or worse, it's always been both for me, since I'm eight years old), then you're a fool if you don't recognize and appreciate fully the trail blazed by Annie Lennox --- granted she wasn't alone, she had Dave Stewart as a bandmate in Eurythmics, and she had Debbie Harry and Pat Benatar and a handful of others around her in the arena of pop --- the trail that Madonna and Cyndi Lauper and Courtney Love and Christina Aguilera and Pink would all walk down.  Using audio AND video to skew and shatter perceptions of what women were capable of in music, in artistic expression, Lennox --- better and more so than anyone else (save, perhaps, Madonna) who came of age musically in her time frame --- is a complete chameleon.  She'll change colors on you before your very EYES.  Consider this about the Eurythmics' daring music:  it had an extremely unique flair (in '83, in '86, in '05, for crying out loud, you KNEW when you were listening to a Eurythmics song; be it that stunning, still-unmatched intro to \\"Here Comes the Rain Again\\" or that haunted, maddened quasi-wail that opens \\"Who's That Girl\\" or the beyond-clever reprise of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" that closes their most underrated single \\"17 Again,\\" there was NO doubt when it was Annie time on the radio) without having a homogenous sound.  That's terribly crucial, and it sounds easy but it's not:  the music had the same general flavor but it had different, specific tastes.  (Contrast that, for example, with those hapless, hopeless martyrs Creed, whose music is ALL THE SAME:  \\"My Sacrifice\\" is exactly the same song as \\"Higher\\" isn't it?  And wasn't \\"Higher\\" just a half-beat step up from \\"My Own Prison\\"?  And if \\"One Last Breath\\" wasn't \\"Arms Wide Open\\" all grown up, I'll eat this keyboard.)  The vast palette of colors with which Lennox and Stewart created musical masterpieces remains riveting 25 years past their first collaboration, and this career retrospective --- the best I've seen since George Michael's best-of seven years ago --- is a pitch-perfect way to close chapter one of their journey.I've seen since George Michael's best-of seven years ago --- is a pitch-perfect way to close chapter one of their journey.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I love Grey's Anatomy. I watch it every week and I can't wait for it to come out on dvd. I recommend anyone and everyone to watch this show. It is a show with heart,humor and of course love in the medical field.
B00025ETIW|5.0|there are no words to describe how awesome this group and this CD are. they totally blow me away every time I listen to them. there's nothing quite like them; they are, as far as I can tell, TRULY unique. they're addicting. Gerard Way has amazing vocal talent, and he's a lyrical genius. <br /> <br />don't listen to what other people say about how they cause headaches, and their lyrics are all about cutting and depression. the lyrics make me LAUGH. all except for \\"the ghost of you\\", of course, which is heartbreakingly beautiful. (yes, beautiful).  <br /> <br />this album is worthy every damn penny.
1590710487|5.0|John Belushi has been, I think, one of the most misunderstood late celebrities in recent memory. This was due in large part to a certain book by a certain reporter, whose name I won't speak here. Judy Belushi Pisano went a long way towards setting the record straight in \\"Samurai Widow,\\" letting the public into her grieving process and the aftermath of John's death in 1982.<br /><br />Now we've come full circle with this wonderful biography of the man himself, told by those who knew him best. John was many things to many people, and all facets of his life and personality are talked about in this book, often with amazing candor.<br /><br />I also have to comment on the wealth of photos included in the book, many from the private collections of Judith and the Belushi family. They're a real treat to see (John was a very cute little boy) and add to the sense that this is a very personal biography.<br /><br />Fans of John will love this book. It reveals the funny, kind, infuriating, generous person that we as his fans, who could only know and love him through his work, always knew he really was.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|They had used the ending from the book rather than a hollywood-esque sort of ending. In the book there's a reason the water's dark. And that would have been REALLY scary.
6305078491|5.0|Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer, who is renowned for his extremely important masterpiece THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1928), created one of the most stylish horror films ever made when he filmed VAMPYR - DER TRAUM DES ALLAN GREY in 1931. It is loosely based on the Carmilla vampire novella by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.<br /><br />Stylistically, VAMPYR is a silent movie: the dialogue is extremely sparse and even less of it is subtitled. The imagery in this movie is astounding, despite the fact that this movie is in very poor shape and in bad need of restoration. It is one of the eeriest movies I have ever seen, and the imagery of light and shadow in particular give this film a nightmarish quality.<br /><br />Julian West plays the young man David (or Allan) Grey who checks into an inn only to be disturbed by a mysterious old man who hands him a package only to be opened in the event of his death. Led by a series of strange shadows (animation?), Grey eventually winds his way onto the old man's estate where he keeps two daughters, one of whom may have been bitten by a vampire (because she has \\"Crazy Eyes\\"), and the other, played by Sybille Schmitz, who I happen to find extremely appealing.<br /><br />The poor quality of the print actually adds to the nightmarish effect of this film. This is a great movie to see very late at night, when the neighborhood is quiet, and nobody else is at home.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt
B000BBOUU4|5.0|When this movie first came out, I heard a lot of critisism about it.  A lot of people, whom I consider closed minded, thought that it did the first movie no justice at all.  What I have to say about that is, It wasn't supposed to.  Tim Burton is a Genious.  He is not stupid.  If he wanted it to be like the first, it would have been.  This movie is follows the book so much better, where as the first is loosely based off the book.  This movie in my opinion is so much greater thean the first because you get the whole story.  All should own this movie.
B000B7HZXM|2.0|These were never great versions to begin with but they are now starting to get worse. Rod is clearly bored with this material--no matter what he says in interviews. This is by far the worst of the series. If you must buy one--get either #3 or #1, but avoid this like the plague. NOTE TO CLIVE DAVIS: YES, you have proven you can sell anything now leave Rod Stewart and his millions alone. NOTE TO ROD STEWART: Now, how about making some good music again? You don't need any more money nor do your kids. Start working on what's left of your legacy. You were born to sing blues, soul and/or rock--so get after it soon. ANd stop being such a lazy bastard and write some songs again!
B000BHHVPO|5.0|These DVD's are amazing!  I mainly bought them cause I'm a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and their set was amazing.  But to pay 30-40 bucks for this many artists, what could be better?!?  The cause is great, the dvd quality is great, the artists are great, the songs are great...  WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!?!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I recently noticed that Pitchfork gave \\"Plans\\" a fairly poor review, calling many of Death Cab's albums \\"interchangeable,\\" with an especially damning critique of the brilliant single \\"Soul Meets Body.\\"  To me this indicates just how cynical much of the college music press has become.  \\"Plans\\" is, in my humble opinion, the best album of the year, even beating out Sufjan Steven's \\"Illinois.\\"  Then again, I also thought Husker Du got even better with \\"Candy Apple Grey\\" even though a lot of \\"alternative\\" kids at the time (there was no such thing as \\"indie rock\\" back then) thought it was a sell out.  Its a classic now, just as \\"Plans\\" will be 19 years from now.  This is a beautiful pop album by any standard of the imagination--\\"Soul Meets Body\\" one of the best singles in years.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect before purchasing this album, so I didn't set myself up for anything. I can now say that I am blown out of the water impressed. Eyes-wide-open giddy. I would love to say that this is Reznor's best work since Pretty Hate Machine, but to compare the two would be a mistake. To me it is in the same style as PHM, but it is defenitely interesting to hear how Reznor has grown as a musician. I suggest listening to both PHM and With Teeth back to back. There is a maturity and solidness to his vocals, yet the unmistakable rawness is still there, seemingly made stronger by experience. ALL of the tracks are amazing, but I am partial to Only, Sunspots, and Right Where It Belongs. You can't lose with this CD.
0385512104|4.0|Coming from a city where autism is on the rise, this was a very enlightning read. Because I knew so little about it, I confess that while reading I had to pause and double check the book cover to make sure this wasn't a children's book. Haddon's debut proves him a genius in defining the inner brain of an autistic English boy. Written as a journal, the language is very simple as is that of an autistic child. But don't be fooled by the simplicity of the words, as the story does keep you locked in to know what happens next. The story starts out on the quest of 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time'. Christopher wants to know what happened to this dog and on his quest discovers more than what he can absord, about the dog, about his father and others. This is a very pleasant and easy to read book.. recommended for those who want a break from the genres of books they always read..<br /><br />very curious to see what else comes out of this brilliant author...
0975991477|4.0|Bruce Lipton is an entertaining author and is not afraid to espouse his iconoclastic beliefs, so I awarded him an extra couple of stars for courage. However, often he just goes too far, and strays perilously outside of the boundaries of scientific evidence, tending to blur objective reality and fantasy. The biology of belief is essentially a lay-person's guide to a biology that is based on his systems theory and a thesis of holistic function. Dr Lipton's emphasis that DNA provides templates for reproduction of proteins but is not necessarily the \\"mind\\" behind the selection process is an interesting proposal, and his been posited by very credible scientists(e.g. The Music of Life: Biology beyond genes, by Denis Noble). His emphasis on membrane function, communication and cooperation between cells, and the potential \\"self-sabotage\\" by a maladapted subconscious nervous system, are all points well taken, but require much more scientific exploration to establish a clear model.<br /><br />I was very disappointed by the limited scientific detail. I encourage him to develop an additional academic version. In addition, he was very quick in disparaging our so-called conventional system of medicine, but he did not clearly suggest any realistic improvement based on evidence. Biomedicine, with all of its deficiencies, is not only the best system that we have developed, but has an exciting future in that it is open to scientific exploration that will improve it even further. Having said that, I agree that in some situations, there is an over-emphasis on pharmaceutical intervention, and that biomedicine can be complemented by other systems, especially for prevention, symptom control, mind/body wellness, and rehabilitation.<br /><br />I look forward to a more scholarly book.
0553801503|5.0|I couldn't wait for the U.S. edition and bought the U.K. edition. Though I certainly miss the POVs that are not included in this volume, but outside of that, the writing is the same high quality that we all have come to expect from GRRM. The plotlines advance quite nicely. Not quite as many \\"action\\" scenes as in Storm, but a fantastic volume nonetheless.
0972169504|5.0|This is a great book for any first, second... or sixth year graduate student.  While its main characters are mostly engineer-types, I am sure humanities majors would also appreciate the witticisms presented here in cartoon form on the trials of advisor-student relations, free food, and procrastination techniques.  Most of the time I was laughing hard and appreciating the commentary for its accuracy, rarely it was so spot-on as to be a little depressing!  I recieved it as a gift from a grad student one year ahead of me, and I gave it to someone a year behind me.  We all loved it.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I once made the comment that most of the entertainment today is in very bad shape.  The industries are trying to relive past glories, especially music and movies.  Most of the money being made in the music industry is reissues, HDCD releases of well-known titles, delux reissues, legacy reissues, offical releases of bootlegs, greatest hits, and any and all repackaging of classic albums.  And they all use well known, classic, big name artists, because they know people will buy it.  Because the majority of new CDs, and new artists aren't of any real quality, they have to rely on the old stuff to make money.  The same can be said of the movies.  It's all sequels, prequels, remakes, and remodels. <br /> <br />Accordingly, I was not thrilled when I heard a new version of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" was coming out.  When I learned it was a Tim Burton/Danny Elfman/Johnny Depp production, I was less skeptical.  When I saw a trailer, I was interested.  When I heard Danny Elfman was writing/composing the music AND doing the vocals, I was excited.  The collaboration is great, almost to the point of excusing all their pretensiousness and self-absorbtion...  enough quibbling.  On to the movie! <br /> <br />It holds many of Tim Burton's staples; it is dark, stark, eerie, and filled with the regular unnamable props, but he has allowed joy into the equation.  The movie is much better for it.  There is rich color, specifically in the factory, to match the rich imagery and funny comparisons of Willy Wonka.  Depp is cast perfectly in this role, which is not really apparent unless you see the movie.  He is funny, quirky, confused, and innocent; much different than the brilliant, strong character played by Gene Wilder in the original.  The children who find the golden tickets and their parents do a great job too.  Perhaps my favorite part is the wild card, Danny Elfman.  If you don't know WHO Elfman is, you're sure to have heard his music whether in any number of cult classic 80's films (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Batman 1 & 2), his TV themes (The Simpsons), his musical-esque movies featuring his vocals (Nightmare Before Christmas-- an absolute classic soundtrack), or his 15-plus years of work as the vocalist/writer/guitarist for 80's heavyweight Oingo Boingo.  \\"Charlie\\" is the 11th time Tim Burton has used Elfman as his composer, and this is arguably their greatest work together (though I prefer \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\"). <br /> <br />The movie itself is quite interesting, moving into parts of the Willy Wonka story the orignal movie didn't, relying more on the Ron Dahl book.  Note: even the lyrics to the four Oompa-Loompa songs are the lyrics from the novel.  We learn that Willy became a chocolateer to spite his father and is forever haunted by this falling out.  An eventual redemtion of their relationship serves as a very positive pro-family element.  Best of all, it's clean.  Nothing negative, offensive, or disturbing is presented, meaning a green light for families and kids; a HUGE plus.  The only problem with this version is the lacking special features,  but the casual viewer can always live without them, making for a less expensive buy.  A great, big, fun movie. <br /> <br />Overall:  9 out of 10.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|So.  Serenity.  What is it?  A movie.  It's part sci-fi, part action/adventure, part western, part comedy, part romance/drama, part zombie-movie.  Zombie-movie isn't really a genre, but is should be.  I guess we can say 'horror,' even though I wouldn't.    Anyways, my point is, it's a blend of genres.  None will deny this; one common complaint among the negative reviews was just that: it would go from comedy to horror in an instant.  I guess they found that perturbing.    I mention negative reviews; they're rare.  Positive reviews constitute the vast majority, I assure you.  But don't take my word for it - I'm a convicted felon! Look this flick up yourself on [...], or the review site of your choice.  You'll see.    Anyways, if you buy this movie and watch it, you'll like it.  I guarantee it*.  Literally, everyone I know who saw this movie loved it: my 'Everybody Loves Ray'-watching ('Firefly'-hating) mom, my 'Laguna Beach'-watching sister, my 'Star Trek'-watching dad, and my 'Arrested Development'-watching self.  You'll probably like it, too.  -Steve  *not a guarantee

0553801503|3.0|Like many others I eagerly awaited this book - and suffered through the many changes in publication dates!  Anyway after reading it I am somewhat disappointed and do not feel a \\"fair\\" review is possible until the publication of book 5 which is in fact a continuation of this book.  My main problem is Martin chooses to focus on several of the \\"old\\" characters, introduces new ones, and totally ignores others (some of which were my favorites in the prior 3 books).  Martin does explain at the end of the book that those characters will be covered in book 5 so until that is published I am in a \\"wait and see\\" mode.  That being said, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it - just know up front you are only getting half a book here.  At least we should only have to wait a year for the next installment.  I just hope Martin isn't going to go Robert Jordan on me . .  too many characters, too much detail, not moving along the story line, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE:  OMG TODAY IS AUGUST 30, 2009 AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE NEXT BOOK IN THIS SERIES - IF AND WHEN IT IS EVER PUBLISHED WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I WANT TO READ IT.<br /><br />UPDATE:  S . L . O . W...  F.O.R.W.A.R.D.  to 2011 ............Well I did read ADWD's against my better jugement.  At least I got it from the library and didn't put any $$ into Georgie's or Bantam Books pockets.  ADWD was a bust - unfortunately, it wasn't an improvement over AFfC's.  I don't know where George went or who took him, but they need to bring him back.
B000AOEN2C|4.0|I thought that the enterprise series was pretty good.Season three was the best season and the most interesting.The theme song was very unlikeable to me.I hated it. I really liked the changed theme song that they used for In the mirror darkly part 1 and 2,in season 4. That would have been much better for the whole series.I wish that TPol and TRipp had got married at the end.  I didnt understand why he died in the last episode when in a previous season they had an episode with his son in it. Overall it was very entertaining to watch.  But i liked the other 4 Star Trek series much better. I own the entire library and will watch them all several more times in my life time.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Silently I groaned when my daughter and her tweenie friends chose \\"Freaky Friday\\" as their movie choice two years ago.  But we all just loved it!  Now we have the DVD and watch it about every other month or so.  The acting is very, very good, and I was impressed that Linsey Lohan did a good job of pretending to be a middle-aged mom stuck in a teenage girl's body.  Same for Jamie Lee Curtiss (actually the opposite).  They pulled it off and made for a great movie experience!

Tracks that stands out to me are \\"Dynamite,\\" \\"Star Child,\\" and \\"Love Blind.\\"  Pick it up you will enjoy it. <br /> <br />*fists in the air* Brit soul forever!
B00028HBKM|3.0|I don't speak ancient aramaic, and I'm probably being uncool to admit that I hate to read subtitles.  But my problem with this film is the violence.  I think it's way too much, and really bruises the viewers unneccessarily.  I understand that part of the Christian experience is to understand the sacrifice and pain, but I felt like I was watching a Tobe Hooper Chainsaw massacre at times.  For the violence, I give the film 1-star and WARN PARENTS before scarring their children.  For Gibson's good intentions, I give the film 5-stars.  It averages to 3 stars.

0393327655|5.0|I had quibbles with The End of Faith upon first reading, finding, for example, the arguments on the topic of torture simply baffling.  Yet I have come to believe that Sam Harris is one of the most significant skeptical thinkers and- what is more important- public figures in the world today. <br /> <br />I had the pleasure of attending several of his presentations at the Towards a New Englightenment conference in Buffalo, New York.  Mr. Harris' energy and arguments were gripping.  He pulls no punches regarding the danger to democracy we presently face due to the rise in irrational beliefs.   <br /> <br />Several reviewers have taken umbrage at the book's presumed anti-Islamic comments.  Yet it is rather difficult to contemplate how a book on fundamentalism and its dangers could be otherwise, given the overt attacks from that quarter on democracies around the world.  By definition, believers in Islam will treat all rational criticism of the koran's many incitements to violence as \\"anti-islamic\\", so I suppose no surprise. <br /> <br />Too early to call Sam Harris the leader of a movement, but there is little doubt that he has the potential to be one.  So, to the young skeptics and potential young skeptics of the world: give him a listen.  The other side can keep their bogus Christian rock and mass-meetings in the Astrodome.  Skeptics are the true rebels, and they just might have found their modern face. <br /> <br />

B00001OH7V|5.0|Simply put, people are obsessed with this album.  Everything from the cover pose to the subject of \\"heroes\\" is mulled over. <br /> <br />Now then, ahem...the cover (Im obsessed too) mimics a self-portrait of one of Bowie's favorite painters.  However, I think it is clearly Bowie 'miming', taking off his hat to the listener, as he had worked in a famous mime group in England.   <br /> <br />The story of the albums' creation is one of the most interesting and mysterious in rock.  The mystique of Bowie was at its height.  He supposedly cleaned up and left LA for Wall era Berlin 1977, living in a Turkish ghetto, de facto perhaps to focus in on his depression, recording a few feet from the Wall.  \\"Heroes\\" is one of the greatest songs in rock, while the second half of the album is icy germ-rock, with an overpowering oriental overtone.  It gets written about more than listened to, as it is an austere listen.  'Low' and 'Heroes' seem works of a piece, as both become instrumentals in their second half.   <br /> <br />This Berlin era influenced countless bands.  While \\"Nevermind the Bullocks...\\" was the birth of punk rock in 1977, this was the birth of what came after punk rock...postpunk and new wave.  Joy Division and New Order at best, Duran Duran and anyone with a synthesizer/haircut at worst, all seemed under his influence just a few years later.
B000002V07|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch Mazzy Star performing this album LIVE at the legedary Fillmore in San Francisco soon after it was released. It was one of the most riveting, magical sets I have ever witnessed. Suffice it to say that if Hope Sandoval and company had performed that set on that stage in the late '60s, she would have ruled the San Francisco music scene just as surely as Grace Slick did in the day. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of psychedelic music, you simply must add this fog-shrouded diamond to your collection.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Isnt it funny how some records are not so much a matter of taste, but a litmus test of whether one who listens to a certain genre even has taste or not?  This is such a record, morose and brooding, then rhapsodic and joyous.      'Kooks' was cited in the Smiths' 'Sheila take a Bow', how I first looked it up.  This is a Bowie gem, too personal to be resurected by other groups, like his other songs.  It is his ode to his newborn son, sweet and sad.  He sings how he will raise his son, fearing the day he grows up and one day leaves him behind.  Such a complex Bowie thought, but a universal feeling.    Much of this record is melancholic, with some 'proto-metal' thrown in.  This was a very influential album among other musicians.  There is more than a few lyrical allusions or even band names taken from these lines.      This merged to his 'glam' period,  which left behind his quaint folkiness.  Ziggy music was far weaker in my opinion, and in that of most of his biographers/writers etc. it was most popular with teenagers.  His 'eno tryptich' of low/heroes/lodger returned Bowie to this level of subtlety and maturity.  Interesting how his cover pictures can tell you the feel of the music.  Hunky Dory is warm and intimate, Heroes is cold and distant.     By the way, a recent British survey of 'greatest records' accurately and suprisingly rated this the highest of Bowie's masterpieces.  Though even classic Bowie seems to fall in and out of fashion, this is a masterpiece you carry in your mind, waiting to be discovered by new listeners.
0312966199|5.0|This is a book you will want to read again and again, just so you can relive a particularly funny moment. James Herriot is such a gifted story teller that he draws the reader right into the story. You truly feel as if you are standing by his side and observing what is happening. As you read you get a picture in your mind's eye of what is described in each page. Absolutely brilliant.
0739308742|2.0|I LOVED the first three audio versions of the Songs of Fire & Ice series.  The stories are extremely well written, but it was the narration by Roy Dotrice that made the series for me.  His accents and timing were perfect, and the voice in my head that I associated with Arya, Sandor & Danerys were his tone and inflection.   <br /> <br />I can't express the disappointment I felt when I found out that Random House did not secure Roy Dotrice for A Feast of Crows.  Apparently they were too rushed to get the audio version of this book out the door, and didn't give Mr. Dotrice enough lead time to fit it into his schedule.  I wanted to keep an open mind about the new narrator, John Lee, but it turns out my disappointment was well founded.  <br /> <br />John Lee is no Roy Dotrice. I've found him confusing and difficult to follow. He changed many of the pronunciations (which I can live with), but since he doesn't make enough of a distinction in the voices of the characters, the dialogue is confusing at best and nearly impossible to follow at it's worse. <br /> <br />Two stars from me. A George RR Martin story could never earn less than that, but the disappointment over the audio version warrants no more. My recommendation - buy the book. And hopefully Random House will go back to Mr. Dotrice on the next one. <br />
0553801503|5.0|First off, I think it's a bit pointless to review book 4 in this completely amazing series. If you haven't read the other 3, you won't be reading this one, and if you have you'll most likely be reading this one no matter what anybody here says. But I'll do my best anyway. <br /> <br />I got my copy back on October 18th by ordering it from Amazon.co.uk. I finished it shortly thereafter. So yes, I have read the book. <br /> <br />The bottom line with this book is that it is a great, entertaining read, but it *feels* like the half-a-book that it is. It's like an appetizer before a real meal. It just doesn't quite satisfy. That's not really a complaint as I can't imagine enjoying this book more than I did. Except... <br /> <br />The one thing that disappointed me about this book is the lack of chapters about my favorite characters (John, Dany, Tyrion, Davos). Arya is on that list, but she has a few chapters (3, if I remember correctly). It comes out to be about 60% Jamie and Cersei chapters with a smattering of others, including several new POVs, mostly among the Ironborn. <br /> <br />The other 'feature' of this book is the fact that every single character's last chapter is a cliffhanger. Big ones. There's not really *any* closure, which I suppose is where that lack of satiation comes from.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, there is a lot of new information to be had regarding the past, some of which is pretty surprising. <br /> <br />In short: read it, love it, start waiting for the next book again. With the pieces set they way GRRM has them at the end of this book we'll be in for a wild ride in A Dance of Dragons.
0394800389|4.0|Our son always cracks up when we read this book together - he has taken to memorizing some of the funnier lines, and says them faster than I can read them!  I even took this book to my son's pre-school to read to his class - they loved it.  Can't go wrong.
B000B8I8X2|4.0|Ok...There a few songs here that don't seem to fit but, there are more that just RIP!  I was a little apprehensive about picking this one up but, I'm glad that I did.  I absolutely love The Dagger, In the Fire, Independent, and Army of the Sun.  I think these 4 songs are worth the price of the disc alone.  The rest of it is pretty decent but, that's just it, decent.  I love the idea of this album.  As a few people have said, I would die to see something like this from Century Media, that would be killer!!  Anyways, overall this is a good c.d.  In the dvd Dino Cazares mentions something about possibly setting this up as a band in the future.  Would be nice as far-fetched as that seems.  Worth a shot for any metal fan.
B00005N919|4.0|Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.<br /><br />After watching the new DVD of the uncut & uncensored version of the 1992 erotic-thriller Basic Instinct, I was surprised at how well the movie has aged. I also noticed that it doesn't seem quite as shocking as far as the sex scenes & subject matter are concerned as it originally did when it was in theaters.<br /><br />When this film was originally released in the U.S. back in 1992 (in edited R-rated form), it ignited a firestorm of controversy in which gay alliances blasted the film saying that it painted homosexuals as nothing but murderous psychopaths. Women's groups also said that the movie was extremely misogynistic as well. I never could really see what everyone was complaining about, since the women in the movie are actually the ones with all of the control and power. As it for portraying homosexuals in a negative light, I also disagree. But that's old news.<br /><br />Now that the initial debate about the movie has pretty much died, Basic Instinct can now be seen as what it was strictly meant to be, which is one of the best erotic thrillers to be released by a major hollywood studio. It has its problems at times, but for what it tried to do, it succeeds extremely well.<br /><br />The now well-known plot (that I won't give too much away from in case someone hasn't seen it yet) involves Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and Guss (George Dzundza) who are detectives in San Francisco investigating the brutal murder of a former rock star and nightclub owner Johnny Boz (Bill Cable). Johnny was brutally stabbed repeatedly with an icepick during sex at the moment of climax while he was tied up. The prime suspect is the beautiful, intelligent and mysterious Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), an author of erotic murder mysteries who was also Johnny's girlfriend. It seems that her most recent book has a part in which a vicious murder happens that is strikingly similar to Johnny Boz's murder. Nick has had a troubled history as a cop that has included cocaine and alcohol abuse, and accidentally shooting an couple of innocent tourists during a botched stakeout (for which he was cleared of all charges). He has regular meetings with the local police psychiatrist Elisabeth Garner (Jeanne Tipplehorn) with whom he had an intense relationship with at one point. He's also being kept under the watchful eye of Internal Affairs due to his checkered past. During the investigation, Nick finds himself becoming extremely attracted to Catherine, much to everyone's dismay. Catherine is also bisexual and lives with a beautiful lesbian named Roxy (Leilani Sarelle). The movie ends up piling red herrings on top of red herrings, and some characters end up not being quite who they seemed to be at first. The plot barrels along to an abrupt conclusion that will likely make people scratch their heads and utter a collective \\"huh?!\\".<br /><br />This was Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's third American film after his breakout success with 1987's cult-classic Robocop and the equally ultraviolent 1990 sci-fi Schwarzenegger vehicle Total Recall. He has stated in many interviews that one of his favorite filmmakers of all time is Alfred Hitchcock. He viewed Basic Instinct as his chance to make a Hitchcockian type film but with some explicit sexual content that caused audiences (especially those in the U.S.) to sit up and take notice.<br /><br />The infamous sex scenes in the movie caused a great stir since they combine both sex and violence in sometimes jarring doses. A perfect example is when Nick and Elisabeth begin to passionately make out in her apartment. What starts out as very erotic turns savage when Nick borderline rapes her while entering her from behind. Another would be the opening shot showing an unknown woman having sex with Johnny on his bed. She is on top of him and eventually ties up his hands while he sucks and kisses one of her nipples. After tying them, she starts to bring them both to orgasm before stabbing him repeatedly in the face and neck with an ice pick.<br /><br />That scene is what really makes the central sex scene between Catherine and Nick so memorable since she also ties up his hands (after some truly carnal activity) and proceeds to mimic the opening scene. The audience I originally saw this movie with in theaters were literally gasping with breath since what started out as erotic quickly turned very tense. It's also nice to see that this movie showed that sexualy explicit material can also be integral to a movie's plot since we're waiting to see if she is going to kill Nick like how Johnny was killed at the beginning. The audience ends up not concentrating as much on the explicit sexual activity as they are what Catherine's planning to do to Nick.<br /><br />The film features some truly gorgeous and moody cinematography by Jan de Bont (who would become a director in his own right with Twister and Speed). Every shot is carefully lit and the lighting is especially great during Nick and Catherine's big sex scene.<br /><br />The music gets a little bit overdramatic at times, but overall really helps to accentuate the film's brooding feel quite nicely.<br /><br />All of the actors do fine work. Michael Douglas is his usual solid self, and George Dzundza adds some much welcomed comic relief as Nick's flustered detective partner Gus. Jeanne Tipplehorn looks great, but her character isn't quite as large as the others, but she does great work with what she had to work with. The rest of the cast are also good. Some of the performances have a quirky tongue-in-cheek quality to them that helps to lighten up the film at various points.<br /><br />But the movie belongs to Sharon Stone. In addition to looking absolutely gorgeous in every scene she's in, Sharon also does a tremendous acting job that got somewhat overlooked by people due to the full-frontal nudity and explicit simulated sex scenes she performed in the film. Her character Catherine really knows how to manipulate people to her advantage and some of the subtle changes she brings in various scenes are truly stupendous. I don't think that I haven't seen many films in which an actress has brought such a natural smoldering sensuality to a role like she did in this. Her work in the infamous interrogation room sequence is a tour-de-force.<br /><br />The plot is what brings this movie down a bit at various points. Written by Joe Eszterhas (before he ended his career with Showgirls), the movie strikes a pretty good balance for the most part. But there are places where it is evident that he got a little more caught up in the sexual excesses of the story instead of supplying a completely coherent plot. This is most evident in the movie's conclusion that raised a lot of debate since it was kind of vague as to who the killer actually was. This isn't Shakespeare, and it does get a little silly at parts, but overall his script gets the job done (even if it is a bit similar to Jagged Edge at times, which he also wrote.) I wish the ending had been a little more fleshed out since it feels just a bit rushed during the final stretch.<br /><br />I really don't think that they exploited the whole lesbian angle nearly as much as they could have. People who blast the film for supposedly putting homosexuals and women in a negative light are really missing the point of the movie IMO.<br /><br />It's been close to 10 years since this film was originally released, and it has aged pretty well. Since this movie, there have been numerous other films that have pushed the envelope much more than this movie did, so now it doesn't seem quite as shocking as it initially did. While it is nowhere near Hitchcock, the fact that they implemented that feel and style into this movie really helped to elevate it and make it much more than just erotic trash.<br /><br />The plot doesn't hold up all the way through, but overall I rank Basic Instinct near the top of it's genre. My 4 (actually make that 4 1/2) star rating is based purely on comparing this movie to other films like it. Sure, if you start comparing this movie to Saving Private Ryan or Gandhi, it's going to not seem that great. But taken for what it is, it is one of the best and a great showcase for Sharon Stone. The combination of violence, explicit sex and sexual ambiguity make Basic Instinct one of the best guilty pleasure films ever made.<br /><br />The recent special edition DVD is chock full of extras. In addition to a commentary track featuring Paul Verhoeven and Jan de Bont, there is also one in which a feminist critic actually ends up praising the film (and she does a great job explaning why.) Anyone who has labled the film as misogynistic would be wise to hear her comments. There are also segments showing the differances between the butchered network T.V. version and the original cut and the expected interviews with the cast and crew. Also, it's presented in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio. If you have ever tried watching this film in pan/scan, the widescreen DVD is most welcome indeed!<br /><br />I strongly recommend checking out the unrated director's cut of the this movie versus the censored R-rated version. The unrated cut is much more explicit but also seems more appropriate and smooth.<br /><br />Basic Instinct the director's cut is not rated and contains explicit sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and strong language.rformed in the film.

B00005JNZ4|2.0|I saw 'Must Love Dogs' at a cheaper ticket price then usual. It was eight dollars. Usually it would be fifteen dollars for one film and the price will always increase. I also enjoy films with Diane Lane. In my DVD collection I have 'Under The Tuscan Sun' and 'Unfaithful'.<br /><br />I was also appealed by John Cusack. In this movie his favorite film was Dr. Zhivargo. In 'Serendipity' with Kate Beckinsale, he enjoyed 'Cool Hand Luke'. I was also pleased to see Dermot Muloney from 'The Wedding Date' in this film as I thought just recently that he looked a little like John Cusack, and purhaps should have been in Dermot's place in 'The Wedding Date'. Still no harm has been done and I am delighted that they are both in this film.<br /><br />From the looks of the title dog lovers should enjoy this film. Indeed there should be enough moments in this film with dogs to keep people happy. The only thing is, maybe the lure and love of two people no longer got the producers of this film excited, so opted for a different approach with the dog title. A new direction is always important with films. There is really nothing worse then being like all the other films around.<br /><br />There is a wonderfully attractive cast that purhaps isn't put to as good use as they could have been with a stronger story. There doesn't seem much of one, and what is there, they could have done a lot more with. From the looks of both actors sitting on a park bench beside a dog and surrounded by green trees and lush green grass, we could be in for some fun. And while the park bench is occupied by more people then lone Tom Hanks in 1994's 'Forrest Gump', this 'Must Love Dogs' film feels quite empty of the couple together and a lot of running around in circles by everyone. So maybe the couple in question should enrich their life experiences by not advertising themselves online, but take a chocolate from Forrest's chocolate box. If anything it might increase the viewers interest and pleasure in this film. Still I'm sure this film will be fondly remembered by some.<br /><br />While I enjoyed a scene where John Cusack and Diane Lane had to go to the chemist so John could replenish his condom suply, that was funny and indeed could happen. I remembered a movie called 'Trojan War' from 1997 with Jennifer Love Hewitt, in which the guy Will Friedle, who's after another girl's affection, that of Marley Sheldon, spends most of the film in search of a pack of condoms. So it has been done before but not often, so at least that's one thing it's got going for it. Still I'm glad this film is around. Just a bit of a let down in places I'm sorry to say. Still cute looking at dogs and stars. Just as you would look at dogs in a window with either the intent to buy one or merely wonder \\"How much is that doggy in the window?\\"his film.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|Megadeth has always seemed to exist in the shadow of Metallica, which is ironic as I've always considered Megadeth to be the far superior band. Megadeth guitarist/singer and leader Dave Mustaine was also a founding member of Metallica before being unceramoniously given the boot in early 1983 due to his ego and substance abuse.<br /><br />The fact that he started Megadeth in 1984 purely out of hatred and jealousy of his former bandmates in Metallica ended up sort of causing Megadeth to never really get the true respect that Dave and his ever changing roster of co-horts deserved. It seems that every time that Megadeth has come out with a new studio album, Dave is accused of mearly copying Metallica's sonic strategies and supposedly even ripping off some of Metallica's riffs. People seem to forget that Metallica kept using Dave's musical ideas all the way through 1986's Master of Puppets (in some cases giving him proper songwriting credits, in other cases not giving him his due credit).<br /><br />In my eyes, Megadeth (and Dave Mustaine in particular) have always had the better songwriting capabilities and a better sense of what truly makes a great song in comparison to Metallica. Megadeth also gradually evolved their sound over the years without resorting to pulling a jarring 180 on their fans like Metallica did so arrogantly about 8 years back with their terrible album Load (some might say they turned their backs with 1991's self-titled release or \\"The Black Album\\" as it's commonly referred to, but I thought that album balanced their sound out nicely.) Granted, Megadeth's 1999 album Risk is considered a sell out by most people, but I really feel that in most cases it was a continuation of the direction they went in on their last album 1997's Cryptic Writings.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />Megadeth has realeased quite a few great albums over the years, but none have ever quite had the impact or lasting quality that 1990's Rust In Peace has had. Almost every truly great band has at the very least that one quintessential album that is pretty much the only one that someone would really need to buy in order to get the best overview of that band's achievments. While I personally like Cryptic Writings the best, there's no denying that Rust In Peace will always be looked back on as Megadeth's finest hour.<br /><br />It was on this album that singer/guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist Dave Ellefson (who besides Mustaine is the only original member) were clear of any substance abuse problems thanks to extensive re-hab for both of them. It also represented them hooking up with drummer Nick Menza and guitarist Marty Friedman. Lots of Megadeth fans consider this lineup to be the \\"golden\\" lineup and they are right. Dave actually managed to keep this lineup together for 4 studio albums and those albums represent the best that Megadeth has had to offer.<br /><br />Rust In Peace is a truly legendary metal album that deserves it's status as an album that was truly ahead of it's time. Something just clicked on this album like it hadn't prior or since then. From the get-go, the listener is treated to a barrage of insane metal riffing that is almost progressive in nature at times due to the constant change-ups in tempo and rhythm. But the complexity of the album isn't just done for complexity's sake. The songwriting is extremely smart and the parts flow into each other like sugar in coffee. This is a virtual textbook for anyone wanting to learn metal rhythm guitar. The drum work is also stellar along with Ellefson's stupendous bass work. He is truly one of the most underrated metal bass players of all time IMO.<br /><br />This album is also celebrated by guitarists the world over due to the insane amount of amazing guitar solos that are present throughout the album. Marty and Dave Mustaine seemed intent on trying to one-up each other in terms of soloing but it was all in the spirit of making the best album possible so even that spirited competition added to the album's greatness.<br /><br />The original release consisted of 9 stupendous tracks and lasted around 40 minutes in length.<br /><br />The original track listing was:<br />1) Holy Wars/The Punishment Due<br />2) Hangar 18<br />3) Take No Prisoners<br />4) Five Magics<br />5) Poison Was the Cure<br />6) Lucretia<br />7) Tornado of Souls<br />8) Dawn Patrol<br />9) Rust in Peace/Polaris.<br /><br />All of these songs are pretty much viewed as classics in the overall Megadeth repertoire. This album just grabs you by the throat from the start and doesn't let up. Since there are so many other reviews already that go into details of these tracks, I'll just try to focus on how I feel this re-mastered CD stacks up to the original release.<br /><br />In early 2004, it was announced that Dave Mustaine was in the process of re-mixing and re-mastering the entire Capitol records catalog of Megadeth releases to be released on July 27th.<br /><br />Rust In Peace is one of the re-releases that benefits the most from the re-mastering and re-mixing. Everything sounds much brighter and punchier. The drums now sound like thunder and the bass growls and rumbles like it never quite did on the original release. In fact, I've noticed things on this album that I didn't before due to how crystal clear and open everything now sounds.<br /><br />All of the re-relased CD's also contain bonus tracks in the form of alternate mixes in some cases and in the case of Rust in Peace you get extra tracks in the form of:<br /><br />10) My Creation (previously unreleased)<br />11) Rust in Peace/Polaris (demo version)<br />12) Holy Wars/The Punishment Due (demo version)<br />13) Take No Prisoners (demo version).<br /><br />The sound quality on these bonus tracks are actually quite good and I've always liked hearing demo versions of songs just to hear how a song evolved to the point of the final recording. The new song My Creation is kind of short but is pretty cool in its own right.<br /><br />Now onto the one aspect of this album's particular re-mastering that has a lot of purists and hardcore fans up in arms.<br /><br />It turns out that when Dave Mustaine got all of the original master tapes for the Rust in Peace album together, he found out to his dismay that that original vocal tracks for the songs Take No Prisoners and 5 Magics had vanished. [EDIT: Epinions.com user Megasoul actually found this out about the track 5 Magics. \\"Just wanna point out that the webmaster at [...] stated that \\"Five Magics\\" was NOT re-recorded (which means that Dave must have used alternate vocal takes from 1990 on the re-issue).]<br /><br />So he had no choice but to re-record new vocals for these 2 tracks. Some people are overreacting and are claiming that he did this to more than just these 2 tracks, but these are the facts from Dave Mustaine himself in a few interviews.<br /><br />So are the new vocals that noticeable or do they just flat out suck in comparison to the original? Well, if you are as big of a fan of the original album for as long as I've been, you will notice the new tracks. I think that Dave did a great job with the new vocals and they are in the exact same style and spirit as the old vocal tracks were. He really had no choice but to re-record new vocals so I don't think he should be faulted for that. It is a little bit jarring at first, but with subsequent listening, I've grown quite accustomed to the new vocal tracks already.<br /><br />All of the other tracks throughout the album have been untouched so the purists can calm down a bit.<br /><br />The CD also features all new liner notes by Dave himself as well as all the lyrics in addition to vintage photos from that period in the band's existence.<br /><br />Rust in Peace is a true metal classic that everyone interested in the genre should own. This new re-mastered CD of the album makes it sound better than it ever has and the sound is improved enough to warrant picking up this new version of the album. While the re-recorded vocal tracks on the 2 previously mentioned tunes might take a little bit getting used to, I don't think that they butcher the songs like a lot of other people are complaining that they do. But I guess it's up to everyone to decide that for themselves.that when Dave Mustaine got all of the original master tapes for the Rust in Peace album together, he found out to his dismay that that original vocal tracks for the songs Take No Prisoners and 5 Magics had vanished.

So are the new vocals that noticeable or do they just flat out suck in comparison to the original? Well, if you are as big of a fan of the original album for as long as I've been, you will notice the new tracks. I think that Dave did a great job with the new vocals and they are in the exact same style and spirit as the old vocal tracks were. He really had no choice but to re-record new vocals so I don't think he should be faulted for that. It is a little bit jarring at first, but with subsequent listening, I've grown quite accustomed to the new vocal tracks already.     All of the other tracks throughout the album have been untouched so the purists can calm down a bit.     The CD also features all new liner notes by Dave himself as well as all the lyrics in addition to vintage photos from that period in the band's existence.       Rust in Peace is a true metal classic that everyone interested in the genre should own. This new re-mastered CD of the album makes it sound better than it ever has and the sound is improved enough to warrant picking up this new version of the album. While the re-recorded vocal tracks on the 2 previously mentioned tunes might take a little bit getting used to, I don't think that they butcher the songs like a lot of other people are complaining that they do. But I guess it's up to everyone to decide that for themselves.
0743455967|5.0|Granny turned me on to this book. She reads every King book, so naturally I bought this for her as a Christmas gift the year it came out. She sent it back to me a few weeks later. Before reading the note, I was afraid she might not have liked it. As a fan of King, I thought, \\"uh oh, what did he write about in this one?\\" But not to worry, Granny know's her grandson is a music book author. She was so moved by this, that she felt I would benefit from it. She was right. Not only was this book entertaining, but it was equally educational, and inspiring. To picture Steve and his brother blowing transformers outside of his childhood apartment, was one of the funny highlights of the book. His near brush with death was one of the chilling highlights. His comments on the supernatural and telepathy were life changing, (were doing it right now). His trails. His education and his educating. His insights. His compliments to the many great writers of our time and the past. As a credit to this book, I have a stack of rejection letters pinned up in front of my desk, (when you read the book you'll understand). Because of King's insight, every rejection was a welcome one. Today the top of that stack are more recent `acception' letters. Had it not been for Steven King's personal stories included in \\"On Writing\\" I don't know if those rejection letters would have built up to purchase orders. Thank you Steven King. For the stories that came before and after \\"On Writing,\\" and for this book. Thank you for your honesty and giving up some of your privacy, as well as what some would choose to guard as insider secrets. Others have and will continue to benefit from your knowledge.<br /><br />From Mark John Sternal<br /><br />Author of \\"GUITAR: Total Scales Techniques and Applications\\"<br /><br />\\"GUITAR: Probable Chords\\"<br /><br />\\"Complete Guitar By Ear\\"
B00009V7P8|5.0|I guess it's supposed to be cool when someone does something entirely unoriginal and entirely fifth grade like giving a great cd a bad review for kicks.  Sort of an underwhelming and unimpressive kick, though.  Get off the couch, Boss! <br /> <br />This is a wonderful album that's perfect at times - on the album and for your life. <br /> <br />Do enjoy!
B00006RU5B|2.0|I like some of their music but the lead singer jsut can't handle the songs that they play and they aren't bad but this is just what I think. If you like rock music with a weak voice then listen to it. Hate me if you want but that is how I feel about it.
B000BGR0OM|4.0|The remastering does sound amazing & the two new tracks (especially \\"I've Got A Life\\") are modern classics.  The only thing I can't comprehend is why the album 'We Too Are One' is left unrepresented.  \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\" & \\"Angel\\" should be here & because they're not, prevent this from being a true \\"Ultimate\\" Collection.
B000002UEB|5.0|Excellent concept album by an excellent band.  If you've been disappointed by their later releases (Hear In The Now Frontier, Q2K, etc.,), buying this album will remind you why Queensryche became as popular as it did.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I love this cd. People who are looking for purely fast beats will be dissapointed. It's much more like a rock cd then punk and what you are used too from Green Day, but it does show their versatility. I love the song American Idiot, Wake Me Up When September Ends, Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, and Holiday. Totally different songs on the same album what more could you want. If you want to get a really great cd buy this one. I was not disappointed at all.
B000BTJCRM|5.0|This album backs up there outstanding EP with complete dignity. I enjoyed every song from the first listen and they still havent got old. Its good that they re recorded their EP songs coz it gives them a bit of a freshness even though i still love the rawness of the other versions. <br /> <br />There couple of i guess you could say 'acoustic songs', not really but thats as close as they'll come... like \\"tales from the forest of the gnomes\\" and \\"vagabond\\" are a real suprise and cant wait till the next album already. If youre ready for some good fun rockin music and you have atleast one rock bone in your body then you must buy this album. Go you good old school aussie boys, make us proud!
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this cd it's one of the best cds I own. Not a single song dissapoints. They have the ability to create different sounds which most rock bands can't do. They also have ability to change the whole face of rock with the ability to add rap into their songs as well. Such a great band. So different from the rest.
B000002GFT|5.0|I'm really loving this version of \\"Tam Lin!\\" I've been obsessed with this song ever since my sister went to the show and told me about it. Now I'm collecting as many versions as I can. So far, my fav is the Outgrabe version, but this is definitely a close second!  <br /> <br />Thanks, Fairport Convention!
B0002858YS|4.0|Some reviewers are apparently disappointed that Hot Fuss is reminiscent of past bands of the 70's and 80's (Forest Law). Yes we have heard this style before. That said, it's been a long time since we've heard it, which may be part of its attraction. It is a revival of a musical style that has been lost in the onslaught of grunge, hip-hop and Top40 dance and boy bands. Entirely original? No, but then there is nothing new under the sun. Originality is the art of concealing your source. What was so new about grunge? Nothing but clothing, really. The Killers are a refreshing return to the past, and fit in well with the trend of revisiting the late 70's and 80's that has been explored by other bands. IF you were alive back then, you're likely to find something familiar about this album -- but in a good way.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Very similar to movies such as \\"Cheech and Chongs Up In Smoke\\" and \\"Half-Baked\\", \\"Requiem Of A Dream\\" finds four wacky drug addicts trying to become successful however bumps on the road such as The Mob, a walking refrigerator, a deranged doctor, and there own addictions continue to derail there quest for success unitl it all comes down to a hilarious finale that will leave you in stitches. featuring a hilarious cast that includes Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly, This is a definate must-have for your comedy collection!!!!
B000021XR5|3.0|\\"Tiny Music...\\" to be their peak, which is not a five star classic but definitely a four star attempt. STP had proved itself to be a deserving survivor of the flash-bang-it's-gone grunge scene with it's eventual melding of glam, psychedelia, and thuddy down-rock. Shame no one was really listening by the time they found their own sound, though. No 4. is an unfortunate product of that frustration, in my humble opinion. What I hear is a return to the sound that made \\"Core\\" such a success, without the worry that they would be considered a Pearl Jam knockoff. They liked that sound. And if you did too, then you should pick up No.4.  <br /> <br />Weiland, I'm happy to say, has gone on to explore his slithery, desperate, slightly forced and curious sexuality with Velvet Revolver(although it could be just an amalgamated generic rock act full of borrowed antics), and while I don't really think the music is up to snuff, if you want to see where the spirit of STP went, catch up on VR's career. That's probably not fair to the DeLeo's, but whatever.
B000002A3T|1.0|the first time i played this album i thought i clicked on my porno instead 'cause this album was awful, i'de really recommend a different album go earlier, *alot* earlier... pink floyd in my opinion died out after the wall. \\"The Final Cut\\" was really the wall part 2, and anything after is really basically the same to the division bell. <br />To all the new fans of Pink Floyd i really do not recommend this album, go for Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here. <br />My faves is really anything before 1979. There is Pulse aswell that's pretty damn good...
B000BHHVPO|4.0|After much grr-ing and argh-ing at eMpTy V learning nothing in the last twenty years with their 'coverage,' I was going to pick this up regardless due to the reunion of the Floyd onstage, giving hope to the hopeless that peace can be achieved, either on a personal level or if we wanted to kick it Geldof-style, on a global level.<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember the first one and much like the first one, this one is going to get dated fairly quickly, sad to say.  It might be the old curmudgeon in me talking, but (Wotta Big) Maroon 5 and faux Glastonbury hippie Joss Stone (if she married Tommy Shaw, would she be Joss Styx?) are this Live Aid/8's Spandau Ballet and Howard Jones (though it was nice to see every limey pederast's dream has legs (and quite nice ones) under all those broomstick skirts Miss Stone's so fond of wearing).  What cheeses me off is the selective nature of this one, and this time it's not due to loss of the footage.<br /><br />That's not to say it's all bad.  Highlights?  Yeah, there were a few.  Along with the aforementioned Floyd taking The Who's advice and agreeing to get together before they get much older, were The Who, cut in half by the passage of time (and their bassist) but thankfully Roger and Pete's hopes have been dashed at hoping they die before they get old.  Geldof's \\"Great Song of Indifference\\" with Campino from Die Toten Hosen was great.  U2 almost made me feel like it was pre-1985 all over again, until \\"One\\" came on.  I almost respect Green Day again, though they're still responsible for the crop of Hot Topic punks I despise.  Elton John was fantastic.  He must keep Davey Johnstone in a cryofreezer between shows.  The guy looks the same as he did when Lady Reg was wearing the Donald Duck costume onstage.  Sarah MacLachlan is back to her wood nymph/earth mother phase that was missed when she chopped off her hair and headed up Vulvapalooza at the close of the 1990s.  Bryan Ferry still looks the same as he did last time, though one question in regard to their performance: Where's Phil?<br /><br />The absolute top gear one for me though was Robbie Williams.  Only he would have bottle enough to attempt to come off like Freddie Mercury and succeed at it!  His performance of \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" is right up there with Queen's runthrough of \\"Hammer to Fall\\" from the first Live Aid.  Take that, indeed.<br /><br />Look, unless you were there, you didn't see 98% of this.  Get it and the site specific DVDs later this month.  Feed the world.  Let them know it's Christmas time again.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />epsteinsmuthahough one question in regard to their performance: Where's Phil?   <br /> <br />The absolute top gear one for me though was Robbie Williams.

B00005B36H|5.0|I prefer Aenima's darkness and angst over Lateralus's intraspective complex style.  This is a great album and definately different from Aenima.
B00005JKL8|4.0|I just chanced upon this wonderful war-based adventure-thriler last night.As it title has already said,the movie is about a young US navy navigator who struggles for survival after his fighter plane was shot down in war-torn Bosnia. <br /> <br />Here,Owen Wilson plays Chris Burnett,the navigator who has to flee from the local soldiers,dart behind trees and play dead.It was quite a thrill as you watched him running up and down,hanging for his dear life.However,in the second half of the movie,you began to feel for Burnett as he struggles to seek help from the US navy army via his little sensory phone (or whatever signal that you call it).You also began to to feel the various obstacles he faced as he struggles to survive inthe cold,alone in a total foreign land,with the lack of machinery weapons and tools.It sure wasn't easy for Burnett,with his enemies hot on his heels,with a very stoic,determined hitman,eager to have Burnett dead. <br /> <br />Gene Hackman's portrayal of a commander is also convincing as he pledges to save Burnett's life,going against the rules and orders of his superiors. <br /> <br />It was endrearing to see Owen Wilson in a serious role,where he plays the navigator Burnett.After all,the actor's recent roles in recent years were mostly based on the comedy genre (READ: Shanghai Knights,The Wedding Crashers,Starsky&Hutch).Watching BEHIND ENEMY LINES has allow me to give credits to Wilson as an actor. After all,he did a pretty good job in a convincing portrayal as Chris Burnett,whose auick-witted thinking saves the day,as he struggles for survival in a war torn area,behind enemy lines. <br />
1400032717|4.0|I enjoyed reading about Christopher and I couldn't help but adore him, a very lovable character. I think Mark Haddon did a wonderful job in drawing in the reader.  I have no frame of reference of Autism, none the less found this a delightful read. <br />I was drawn to the other characters such as Mom, Dad, teachers and neighbors.   <br />His adventure with Toby (his pet rat) to find his Mother was funny, sad and scary.  You could really feel Christophers emotions. <br />There were some twists and turns in this book that I wasn't expecting, which ofcourse made an even better story. <br />I would recommend this book.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Im a real fanatic superheoroes fan (count Spiderman,Daredevil,Superman...i watched them all) and im really proud to say i like Batman most. I mean,Bruce Wayne is rich,intelligent,charming and all stark-handsome. <br /> <br />I've watched all Bats-related movies,from Micheal Keaton's brush with Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman to Jim Carrey's joker or Nicole Kidman the shrink with the hots for new Bruce Van Kilmer,and even to Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin...with George Clooney,Chris O'Donell (his name goes something like that) and Alicia Silverstone (Batgirl). <br /> <br />All the above films Batman (1989), Batman Returns(1992),Batman Forever(1995) and George Clooney's (1997) were nice,but a little too bleak.For a start,you might find the visuals effect,other than Tim Burton's,a little too fake. I must say director Christopher Nolan's was a total far cry (thank god). <br /> <br />I'm so much a big Christian Bale fan. I mean,this guy is all so cool. He cries,fights,trains and battles with his emotions all so well,he is no doubt the best Batty ever.No one can ever replaced him. You can't ignore this fact. This is perhaps the darkest Batty film ever,as Nolan chose to explore darker themes which include's the deaths of Bruce's parents,his turbulent childhood/young adult years as well as grappling with a double identity as Bruce Wayne by day and Batman by night. <br /> <br />Here,Bale shows he is indeed such a good actor of great calibre,he puts the rest of the cast,be it his loyal butler Alfred,love interest Rachel (a very redundant Katie Holmes) or Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). His painful moments and past,you're sure to feel the agony too as Bale,an ever brilliant actor,plays it right on the cards. <br /> <br />It's so good-with the right cast (minus ineffectual Holmes),right script and director,dark moments and a wonderful male lead,i give this film two thumbs up. In fact,i'm looking forward to the upcoming sequel too!!!
B000AARKOO|4.0|Wow. Some of you guys are cold. It seems unfair that actors who have made millions being sullen and anti-heroic (Pitt, Cruise, Farrel) now get a chance to play a completely out-of-character role of a man embroiled in myth like Achilles, Nathen Algren and Alexander, and are then compared to the one guy who could pull it off, Crowe. And they are found wanting.<br /><br />Brad Pitt spends a year in the gym pumping up for Achilles, Cruise practiced Samurai combat for 8 months to get ready for \\"The Last . . . .\\" and Farrell, well he kept dying his hair different shades of blond to get the right Macedonian lilt.<br /><br />But in the tradition of Arthur and Modred and Lancelot and Spartacus and Ivanhoe, it's hard to beat Russell Crowe. He was born 50 years late! So comparing Orlando Bloom to the Maximus character isn't going to work.<br /><br />I believe the problem with any 2005 movie with Jerusalem as the venue makes folks generally nervous. I don't know what to think of it. You know you want to say if it is a Holy City it certainly has been the site for such extraordinary suffering for the last 2000 years, and suicide bombers and car bombs and rocket attacks notwithstanding, it still is.<br /><br />Generally the plot was a relatively accurate description of what every other historian referred to as following the Dark Ages. The tranquil time (that's a relative term) between Crusade II and Crusade III.  Bloom is credible and Eva Greene as Syballa was beautiful in the long hair or short hair version and the presence of powerful men such as Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson gave it direction. Like all huge movies, sometimes homeric film shots gave way to our understanding of the purpose.<br /><br />Poor choice of a topic during a time of great political unrest. Good story worth seeing. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B000068G9X|4.0|Glenn Danzig gained notoriety as the singer for the Misfits and continued his goth metal \\"I'm a really evil guy\\" routine with Danzig. This is a raw, but rocking metal CD. The guitar sound is unrefined but works with the songs and their dark tone as does Danzig's measured yowl, and they have just enough melody that you can sing along. Danzig is an evil person and he tells you that on every song. I like the songs but they could use some theme variations. Most people probably know \\"Mother\\" by now but \\"Twist of Cain\\", \\"Am I Demon\\" and \\"The Hunter\\" are strong songs as well.
B000AQBA1W|5.0|I am a semi-fan of the Corrs.  I love their sound, their energy, their style in performance (I've only seen the Royal Albert Hall dvd).  I am semi- only because I think some of their songs are silly, but even the silly ones are done so well that I can't help stopping to listen.    I am also a Celtic music fan, so I had to get this CD if only for curiosity's sake.  This pop group is going to do traditional Irish?  I was sort of expecting to be disappointed.  I wondered is the lead singer of \\"Runaway,\\" \\"Forgiven Not Forgotten,\\" and \\"Dreams\\" going to warp \\"Peggy Gordon\\" and \\"Brid Og Ni Mhaille\\"???  What is Sharon Corr going to sound like solo?  And is Caroline Corr going to \\"over-drive\\" the rhythm with her drumming (I really enjoyed her zest and obvious joy in the Royal Albert Hall performance, but in Buachaill On Eirne)?  I kind of thought Jim Corr would do just fine. He seems to be able to play anything.    After listening to the CD for the third time, I wonder if people are going to realize what a wonder this collecton is.  Except in one or two places (notably the orchestral background and electronic instrumentation with \\"Black is the Color\\"), they've modulated their pop sound and nicely melded it with the traditional material.  Or they've done the song in a traditional manner, and it comes out just gorgeous (I am thinking of \\"Brid Og Ni Mhaille\\" and \\"Haste to the Wedding\\").  Sharon's solo is simply . . . right--as if the song had been written for her.  The vocal backups and bodhran-ning (is there such a word?) were just fine.  I'm trying to imagine which American pop group could pull off something like this.    I even liked the redone modern songs, like \\"Heart Like a Wheel,\\" which I never really cared for in its original version.    Unlike many CD's I've purchased, where after a few times I end up listening to three to five songs, I enjoy every \\"Home\\" track.  I don't have to program my CD player to skip over tracks, I just have to decide which ones I want to repeatbecause I like them best.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Scorsese does a good job of displaying Hughes' paranoia and DiCapprio does an admirable job of expressing Scorsese's vision.  It is a fairly long film but does keep the pace up enough to keep you into it.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|Two or three good songs, the rest are filler. Reminds me of Silver and Gold and a few other recent releases that some people think are \\"Timeless Classics\\". Greendale was the only worthwhile project from Neil in the last 10 years. It must have sapped his creative juices.  <br /> <br />Maye we'll never hear the \\"old\\" Neil again, a depressing thought, but if he's going to keep churning out Wal Mart background music, I wish he'd change his name so I won't be tempted again.  <br /> <br />Didn't some great musician once say \\"Its better to burn out than to fade away?\\"  My my, hey hey. <br /> <br />My love of Neil Young's music goes back to the early 70's in college and my admiration of him personally will never diminish. But his music has taken a change in direction that I no longer enjoy. Boring, tedious, mind-numbing, sing-song, chose your adjective. For anyone that has enjoyed his last few  offerings (Greendale excepted), this one is sure to satisfy.
630521610X|1.0|I'm sorry, I thought this movie was downright stupid for the lack of a better term.  Not scary at all, you know who was getting killed and I just didn't \\"feel\\" for any of the characters.  A waste of my time.
B000B0WODA|3.0|What do you do when a pretty good band records a pretty good sophomore album... that sounds pretty much like their debut album? Answer: you give them one less star in your Amazon review. That's EXACTLY the case with this year's \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" by Franz Ferdinand.<br /><br />The band almost literally photocopied their first album, to the point that I would challenge someone who hasn't heard them before, to tell a song as belonging to one album or the other. Not that they put together a poor album: far from that, but they stuck to the \\"proverbial\\" formula. As much as they stood out in 2004 with their debut, this time around, they became more of the same...

0679422714|3.0|I haven't read this book yet. What promotes me to write a comment is that one reader wrote that \\"the deaths occured not because Mao wanted to kill millions of people\\", definitely the most interesting defense for Mao's crime. Nobody really know what Mao really wanted, but we all knew that he didn't care how many people would die. The loss of human life, even in large number, had never prevented Mao in pursuing his agenda. Did he enjoy having the power to make a lot of people die? It is known that before planing his movements, Mao would jokingly told his confidants that \\"some people are going to die\\". What is the difference between Mao and Hitler and Stalin. The victims of Hitler and Stalin compose of a large number of foreigners or people of different races. The victims of Mao are almost exclusively Chinese. Why some people think Mao is less evil is completely beyond my comprehension.  <br />I totally agree with the authors that Mao is pure evil. I think where the book is lacking is to explore why the Chinese revolution eventually installed the most evil person as the ruler of China. Among Mao's victims are people like the former Chinese President Liu Shaoqi, former Primier Zhou Enlai and former vice Primier Deng Xiaoping. These are not ordinary innocent people like you and me. These are some of the most cunning people who are capable of doing great evil themselves. Deng ordered the massacre of Tiananmeng in 1989. Were they a tad less evil than Mao so that they eventually became his victims?
0446577383|4.0|The Camel Club is a group of four of society's eccentric misfits that have, for one reason or another, dropped out of the everyday world. Their leader, \\"Oliver Stone,\\" calls weekly meetings to discuss the various political conspiracies they believe exist in the world and in Washington D.C. in particular. Part of their job is to decide how they can prevent those conspiracies. <br /> <br />One late night on Roosevelt Island (which is located in the Potomac River), the club members witness the murder of Secret Service agent Patrick Johnson. The witnessing of that murder sets into motion a conspiracy of proportions the Camel Club never dreamed of and one that involves the highest levels of government. And the four men have targets on their backs that might just leave them very dead. Or, there might be a nuclear war that will impact the world forever. <br /> <br />There are tons of interesting characters and plotlines that make one wonder, just who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? If the reader remains patient they will receive a payoff in what is one more exciting and impressive read in David Baldacci's stable of fast paced and breathtaking fiction.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: We'd read David Baldacci if he wrote the copy for cereal boxes. Yes, he's that good of a storyteller! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B00005JO17|5.0|I took my two oldest boys, ages 7 and 9, to see this movie on opening weekend.  The theater was packed!  Obviously a popular choice.   <br />To be honest - we LOVED this movie.  Disney has another huge hit.  The visuals were astonishing, the jokes were funny, adults will enjoy the movie as well as children, and the plot was terrific with a great message throughout the movie. <br />Shame on the critics (especially Ebert and Roeper), what movie were they watching? <br />I enjoyed the movie so much I might fork over the money to go see it in the theater again.  We can't wait for this one to come out on DVD!
0307276902|5.0|James Frey's account of overcoming addiction, accepted (12 step) methodology for overcoming addiction, and indeed overcoming self; was impressive.  The reviewers who question the accuracy of the story (e.g. how the clinic responded to his rebellous attitude) miss the point.  Frey's story paints a picture of the duplicity that lies within all of us....as a character that is simultaneously as strong as anyone you'd ever meet, but with areas of weakness that suggest his stunted emotional growth.  As for his style of writing: The lack of punctuation struck me as superficial and benign (I neither found that it added particularly much to conveying his point, nor did it detract from the comprehensibility of the text...as others have written).  The length of the story didn't bother me in the least.  I became so invested in the characters, that I wanted to know more about them.  In fact, I wished Frey had done more to flesh out the character that represented his college-age love interest...and then some more to extend the story for the limited time he'd spent with his brother toward the end of the story.  In summation, one doesn't have to be interested in the topic of addiction to enjoy this story, just in humanity (albeit with the possibility of our selective memories of our own experiences)
B00005JO17|3.0|There's a rumor that Disney sent all these \\"notes\\" to Pixar on how to \\"improve\\" -Toy Story- before Pixar released it; Pixar read them, said \\"Blech!\\", threw 'em out, & released the now-classic tale.<br /><br />If so, -Chicken Little- took all the notes & used 'em.  & it shows.  Despite the nice voices - Zach Branff as the title character, Gary Marshall as his father, & so on - this chicken lays several dozen eggs.  A sweet tale gets so darn cluttered up, you can't keep track of why they're doing what, as we careen from a high schol w/the attendant clique kick-downs, a baseball game won by the underdog, then the near-bonding of dad & Son,  the discovery of Chicken Little's nemesis, going after Fish Out of Water to the alien ship, the the attendant invasion ...<br /><br />Enough, already! A little less frenetic activity & a bit more heart would suit *so* much better!
B000AP04L0|5.0|I have to say that Office Space has become one of my most favorite movies of all time.  This is a must-see for anyone who has ever worked in an office.  It has to be one of the greatest satires ever made in Hollywood to this date.
0553801503|5.0|The low reviews for Feast seem to be based on three things:  <br /> <br />1. How long the book took to come out - this is just stupid because it has nothing to do with the quality of the book for someone new to the series. <br /> <br />2. The slower pace in comparison to the first three - Go back and read Clash of Kings.  See how the entire book is a build up to the war.  Not much happens but it's brilliant!  After the red wedding, the death of Joffrey, and the resurrection of Catelyn, it's no surprise that the plot slows down.  In fact I welcomed it.  Now that we know just how crazy things can get, now that we know the power Daenerys is amassing, I think it took incredible poise on the part of Martin to not just drop from there right into an ending where everything is quickly explained and they all live happily ever after.  What Martin is doing is building up for the second half of his series. <br /> <br />3. The added history is useless and boring - if anything the history is the most exciting part.  Don't get me wrong, when Tolkien went on and on about who is related to who I almost didn't finish LOTR, but Feast is different.  I read and re-read everything about the history because somewhere in there are the clues to who Jon Snow might really be and other events that will be revealed to us in the future.  The history has always been given in a manner that flowed perfectly with the story and never felt forced.  It's the fact that it's so casually tossed in by characters that causes readers to miss a lot of the most interesting clues about what's really going on.  You'll see when you read the next books.  Or maybe you won't if you have trouble with Feast. <br /> <br />What I'm saying is that rating the book poorly isn't really possible unless you have the attention span of a child and require constant action.  Adults should be fascinated with this book because of Martin's excellent prose and the intricate plot he is setting up.
B0002PUHF6|5.0|Medical student \\"Herbert West\\" ( Jeffery Combs) has just returned from Switzerland after doing a horrifying experiment on a doctor has just joined the myskotonic medical university in Arkansas as he becomes the roommate of a fellow medical student \\"Dan\\" (Bruce Abbot) whom is having an affair with the dean's daughter \\"Meg\\" (Barbara Crampton). But Dan is getting involved with Herbert West's experiments which involves bringing the dead back to life with a special glowing green serum called \\"Re-Agent\\" but unfortunately it creates violent zombies that go awry.<br /><br />A sick, gory, and hilarious horror Sci-fi comedy based on a HP Lovecraft story has become a cult classic since it's release in 1985! This movie was released in that year unrated in theaters with a \\"No one under 18 warning\\" but became a minor hit in theaters including critical acclaim in this cross between \\"E.R\\" and \\"Evil Dead\\". Suprisingly good acting for a low budget movie even by David Gale who wickedly plays the evil Dr. Carl Hill whom becomes the best zombie of the movie. There's alot of nasty gore in this movie like a skull and brain surgery scene with sleaze as well, it's not for the faint of heart or squeamish but a must see and must have for fans of horror, horror comedy, gore and zombie flicks.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Millenium DVD has awesome picture & Sound from THX! great extras include storyboard-scene comparison, audio commentaries, interviews, trailers & TV Spots, Extended scenes from the \\"R\\" rated cut, Bios and Deleted scenes, most recommended.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Evil Dead 1 & 2\\", \\"Day of the Dead\\", \\"Frankenstein ( 1931)\\", \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\"City of the living Dead ( a.k.a.

B000A3XYZA|5.0|Originally released on VHS several years ago, Rodelinda now comes to the DVD. Although the DVD offers little more than the older VHS, it is nevertheless welcome coming, as it does, hot on the heels of the Munich Rodelinda starring Michael Chance and Dorothea Roeschmann. One could argue that the staging is somewhat out of date now, but few could argue the quality of the vocal contributions from each of the soloists. It certainly wins hands down over the Munich performance on Farao. <br /> <br />Rodelinda, one of the triumvirate of classic Handelian operas of the mid-1720s, is a classic of psychological action and shows Handel at his best as an interpreter of human drama and emotion. In the hands of William Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Rodelinda comes alive in a timeless production from Jean-Marie Villgier. A sort of cross between the Prisoner of Zenda and movies of the silent period, this production was atmospheric and moving, though some will rankle at the 'needless' condescensions to humour (Garibaldo's cigarette aria for example, or his leaping up after being shot to take part on stage in the final chorus dispensing champagne to all). <br /> <br />What sets this performance apart from others of the past. at both Glyndebourne and Covent Garden, is the singing. Anna Caterina Antonacci was utterly at ease in the anguished part of the distraught queen Rodelinda, mourning the loss of her husband Bertarido (Andreas Scholl, making his stage debut) and fighting off the attentions of the victorious dictator Grimoaldo (Kurt Streit). The supporting characters are more than simply adjuncts - Louise Winter as Eduige, Artur Stefanowicz (Unulfo) and Umberto Chiummo (Garibaldo) play their parts too in making this an outstanding production. Streit plays the part of Grimoaldo as a noble conqueror, guilty over his victory but unable to contain his passion for Rodelinda, vascillating over whether to have Bertarido executed, though capable of nobility at the end when his life is saved by Bertarido. Chiummo as the treacherous henchman Garibaldo displayed admirable coloratura and an almost feline edge to his actions that effectively got across the double-dealing nature of his character. <br /> <br />Andreas Scholl made his stage debut in this performance at Glyndebourne. Initially edgy and uncertain, his character grows in stature, and by the end his characterisation is utterly convincing. His entrance in Act one with its famous aria 'Dove sei?' was almost as if time stopped and we were transported back to Handel's time - his voice grave, pure and heartfelt. He coped well with some very difficult passage work in Act 2, but brought the house down in his duet with Antonacci at the end of Act 2 (Io t'abbraccio) and his 'Vivi Tiranno' at the end of act 3. His prison scene in Act 3 is streets ahead of the most recent Rodelinda recording in its dramatic awareness. <br /> <br />In all this was a very sucessful production that, by and large, achieved the praise it deserved in the press. Anyone interested in baroque opera will not wish to be without this video, nor will anyone who is a fan of good opera, well sung and well acted. Highly recommended, and worth probably 6 *  <br />
B000BHHVPO|5.0|Let's face it.  Nobody has the kind of acceptance of so many different styles or genres of music that they would sit and watch every song on every disc from this set.  We all have our favorites, but this is where the DVD format has the advantage over older video cassette tapes.  The ability to instantly access the things we like and to effortlessly skip the parts that offer nothing to us makes a diverse compilation like this work, and it could only work on DVD.  Towards that end, this is a great set.  The navigation is very intuitive.  You can search by artist, click on that chosen singer or group and watch all of the performances from them.  At less than 10 bucks per disc, even while skipping over the parts I don't wish to hear, this is a very good price.<br /><br />The quality of the audio and video is first class for this set.  Unlike the 1985 concert where home video was still an infant technology, you can tell that this show was conceived from the beginning as something to be rendered as clear, bright and pristine in a package that really documents the day.  The 5.1 sound is as good as any from my large collection of concert DVDs.  The visual image is very sharp and contrasty, even on my old analog T.V.  These discs lack for nothing as far as the technical rendering is concerned.<br /><br />Truth be told, I was planning on buying this DVD on the day of the concert just to have a video of that terrific Pink Floyd set, and yes, it sounds and looks better than I remember it from the actual live broadcast.  I feel I got my money's worth from just that group (the performance and the behind the scenes rehearsal footage and interviews), and there is so much more to see and hear.  I'm happy!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|This album is huge for Depeche Mode, and it lives up to the hype. I am a huge Mode fan and this is a great album. However, unlike the illiterate reviewer who can't spell \\"exciter\\", this album is worth it through and through. For some it may take a few listens, but this record will get you. Pick it up!
B000A3OS14|5.0|This is an incredible production from some great hits of the 80's converted to Jazz. The song selection is very good and what it's amazing is that some of the songs sound better than the originals, this cd is very good to play any time you want to feel relaxed or it's great to play it as background music in a reunion with friends or at the office. Finally another highlight from this production is that the singers are pretty good, something that is very hard to get when you buy a cd with covered songs from other singers. <br />Check how good sound Madonna's \\"LIKE A VIRGIN\\", Prince's \\"PURPLE RAIN\\", Culture Club's \\"DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME\\", U2's \\"WITH OR WITHOUT YOU\\" and Guns n' roses's \\"PATIENCE\\".
B000002U9E|5.0|Hounds is an outstanding piece of work. Two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly. The first consisting of five individual songs, though all with a very similar feel and texture. The second is a conceptual set of songs called The Ninth Wave, which has had many meanings read into it. <br /> <br />All five tracks from the first piece are excellent. The opening track, Running Up That Hill, is possibly Kate's greatest single of all time (up there with Wuthering Heights and Babooshka), it is a powerful song with simple but highly emotional lyrics. It has been reworked by Aussie outfit Infusion in recent years and become a big dance floor anthem for the likes of John Digweed and DJ Tiesto. It had lost none of it's appeal or sense of urgency over time. <br /> <br />The title track is a beautiful, upbeat song. Again it has made a resurgence in the last year, thanks to mod-rock UK band The Futureheads. <br /> <br />The Big Sky is my favourite (You want my reply? What was the question? I was looking at the big sky!). The extended mix is great and available on the 1997 EMI remastered release of Hounds. <br /> <br />Mother Stands For Comfort is a little out of place, dark and eerie it would have felt right at home on The Dreaming. Kates vocals are, in my opinion, sublime on this track. <br /> <br />The fantastic song, Cloudbusting, nearly deserves a review on it's own. A masterpiece in modern pop, it tells one of the best stories I've ever heard in a pop song, and combines it with one of the best video clips I've ever seen. <br /> <br />The Ninth Wave is beyond review. You need to buy this LP and listen to it over and over again. It will mean different things to different people, and I think that is what makes it so amazing. Commonly interpretted as the story of a woman drowning, I have weaved several meanings through the story at various times of my life, but each ends happily - the whimsical The Morning Fog makes sure of it... Else, just put it on and lose yourself in the soundscape, read nothing into it and take the Ninth Wave for a musical ride. That's my favourite way to listen to it. <br /> <br />Finally, if you ever need to test the ability of a piece of sound equipment, say the $2000 amplifier you're about to splurge on, take the remastered LP as your test. The percussion should be clear, the vocals crisp and the stereo separation precise. An outstanding LP in every way!!
B0006L0LOS|3.0|I'd heard so much bad publicity about this film that it took me forever to watch it.  It wasn't as bad as I expected, but I can understand the criticism.<br /><br />When you say, \\"Catwoman\\", most people also think, \\"Batman\\".  The whole Catwoman story intersects with the Caped Crusader's story line.  This film does not.  This is a stand alone flick that twists several accepted plots.  This Catwoman has super powers that are more like Spiderman's.  The Catwoman I grew up with had mental powers and agility that were a match for the Batman.  The special effects of this film looked more like the effects in The Hulk than the dark edgy Gotham City we have grown accustomed to.<br /><br />However, if I had not had a preconceived prejudice to overcome I would have liked the film more.  If this film had gathered enough attention to warrant a sequel, it would have been fun to watch Halle Berry play up Catwoman's fascination with Batman.  Alas, the film fell just a little short for that to happen.<br /><br />It was a gamble, but I imagine this film is destined to set for a long time in the reduced price section at your local department stores, waiting for the occasional Halle Berry fan to pick it up and regularly overlooked by the Batman fans.  I'm not sure there really are a lot of Catwoman fans???
068484267X|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I love the innocent humor of Frank McCourt and how this is just how his life is. It's like he never doubts for a minute that things could be different. He just accepts his life for what it is. The way he described the family's situation...although is VERY terrible...it's just humorous. What he thinks about his Catholic religion, how he licks the grease off the paper that fish n chips come in...I just love it. It has to be my favorite book by far. I watched the movie and it seems so depressing as compared to how McCourt writes.
1402714572|5.0|Treasure Island is about a boy, Jim Hawkins, who discovered a great treasure by means of a treasure map from an old seafaring man that stayed at his father's inn. With this map he sets off on a voyage with a crew picked by another sailor named Long John Silver, who is  the cause of the trouble on the ship.  <br />   A little while into the voyage, Jim hides in an apple barrel when some of the crew comes into the room he is in, and overhears that Silver has planned a mutiny. The captain and the loyal crew members must decide what to do about the mutiny and how to get the gold back without a ship. <br />   This is a classic adventure novel. It will keep you reading until you are done, and then you will want to read it again. I can't see how anyone would pass up the opportunity to read this great book.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|To the diehard DM fans (I have all there albums/cds)this one will not dissapoint you at all, you may find it to be one of your favorites in time.  It has an appeal that I have not felt for awhile with them.  I peaked with SOFAD and liked Ultra but I lost something with Exciter and felt we (them and me where going in different directions musically), and wham this one brought me back like finding an old friend, if you know what I mean!   <br /> <br />I can't imagine that this will appeal to the newer generation, because of the Hip Hop movement, but if you are of that Hip Hop gen reading this review, give the song \\"Suffer Well\\" a shot. It has alot of the basic functions of DM with the Synths at the beginning of the song, that takes us veteran fans back to the earliest days pre Some Great Reward and then that Guitar Riff brings you back to SOFAD and yet there is a new and freshness about the song, (of course the diehards will say this is the first song that we have ever heard DG write and it is, but he does not break form too much!)This song is catchy enough to make you want to further review the music of Depeche Mode and alas, you may have just stumbled upon a rock gem and legends as the rest of us know.   <br /> <br />Back to you Diehards Play that Angel, because it is!
B0007GAEW6|4.0|I have to admit, for quite some time, I was positively enthralled with TMV. <br />After a while, I don't know, I've listened to all sorts of stuff. <br />To be honest, this CD, although more technically delicious than De-Loused, isn't that musically insane. <br />There are definite Mahavishnu Orchestra influences (I'd prefer MO over TMV any day, too) along with Latin/salsa vibes. <br />Okay, yeah, blah blah blah, great songs, accessable yet trippy and rather long-winded, good or bad. <br />The dead time in this album could either be seen as avant-garde purposefulness or time-wasting feedback to make this CD as long as possible. <br />To be honest, I think they could've released this CD as the title track (which is only available on the Widow single) and Cassandra Gemini in its entirety. <br />I mean, Widow is alright, L'Via is muy interesante, Cygnus is a driving intro, Miranda is the ballad the Widow wants to be, so on, but the non-album track encompasses all these elements and makes them more concise. <br />Another element that drags this album from a five-star rating is how ridiculously morbid it has to be. <br />I mean, come on, Omar and Cedric made Acrobatic Tenement only 9 years ago, which was delightfully innocent and pretense-free. <br />It's almost like now they have to live up to this jaded, death-fixated standard or else. <br />Fine, they can do what they want, but it still feels kind of goofy to me.
B000B5IPLK|3.0|I've been a fan of Alicia's and I've seen 2 live performances from her and it was good. I have to admit that it was in her early days when \\"Fallin\\" was big. As a musician myself I respect and support the guys who perform their own music and especially if they play on it as well, which is why I adore Alicia. <br /> <br />I have however noticed in the \\"Unplugged\\" album that she is going through an identity crisis. Some of the tracks she really tries to bring out the \\"power house\\" singing that some of the other black female artists are known for, and she fails miserably here. She is not blessed with a naturally powerful voice; her breathing is all over the show; really strained to make some of the notes and some she just didn't make at all.  <br /> <br />She also goes for the \\"poem type\\" song which is again is not her style, and is clearly more for the Neo-Soul artists like Erykah, Jill and even Floetry. <br /> <br />All in all I like her music and some of the arrangements were good, but I do cringe on some of the songs but I will recommend it and support Real musicians. <br />
B000006IUQ|5.0|such an astonding movie of nerve racking suspence and a great look at man vs natue this is probly one of the best movies iv ever seen <br />baldwin and hopkins have never been better
6302842174|5.0|Kate Bush is more than a pop artist she is a performance artist....listening to her music alone can take you into a dreamy world of sound that will never be forgotten and can never be compared but to see her videos is to see the artist truly at her best!! If only her videos were released on DVD...alas we live in America....radio and MTV insists that we be obsessed with talentless idiots like Britney Spears and such. I for one refuse!!! Give me brains and talent and a message any day...Thats Kate Bush!!! ART!!!
B00004Z459|3.0|I remember when I was obsessed with these guys. <br />I was 13. <br />Oh my, great times. <br />Then one day, I realized there's this band called \\"Converge\\" that makes all radio-rock sound like bland poop crispies. <br />This album, for its purpose, is just fine. <br />It's not as wretched as Meteora, where all the songs sound just like songs on this album, only even more disgustingly radio-friendly. <br />These songs are decent. <br />There's absolutely nothing offensive about it. <br />There are no filler tracks or 4 minute noise interludes. <br />The most experimentation in the album comes from their DJ making the only song I'd still MAYYYYBE consider putting on a mix CD. <br />The whole two-lead-singers thing is perfectly even, tag-teaming vocals in a logical manner. <br />The production is solid. <br />But then again, that's the point. <br />I look back at it, and it's NSYNC copping Nine Inch Nails' angst and industrial soundscapes. <br />But then again, NSYNC's alright for easily-digestible pop music. <br />That's what the CD is; detuned powerchords, a drummer afraid to use his ride cymbal, and a bunch of songs just crying to be overplayed, remixed, etc. to sell like Usher's latest release. <br />At least they don't seem to try to act like they're all Do-It-Yourself indie hardcore or anything. <br />It's still pop, though, despite whatever people might try to classify it as nowadays.
B000002KHB|5.0|If you use the link through [...] you can support Deep Purple's official website without adding anything to your purchase.  If you love Deep Purple, buy their material, please don't steal it by downloading.  This band has earned much more money than they will ever see.  Be a true fan and buy what you want!
B000001Y5J|5.0|I have had this CD for years and just found out there are hidden tracks on it. One is a cover of an Adam Ant tune, which blows the original away, and the other is something that belongs on a hidden track, but is still quite digestable. This short album is perfect in its focused aggression/desperation. The short instrumentals make release for the tension long enough to make the latter all the better when it kicks in once again. Highly listenable for those that like it heavy. Some of Trent's best work, but what more can be said about that?
B0007CNXUK|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was fairly interesting, beautifully filmed, with decent acting.  I felt Johnny Depp was excellent in this film. In fact he was the best part of  the film. Having read a little about J.M. Barrie Depp seemed to reflect strongly some of Barrie's quirkiness.  Overall a descent film worth watching (though I would rent or borrow it).  Like other reviewers I will mention that this is a Fictionalized story regarding real people and events.   It is NOT an accurate account.  If you are a reader and interested in a more accurate account read the Book J.M. Barrie and the Lost boys by Andrew Birking(who's interviewed in the extra's).
B00005NGZX|5.0|Jane Doe is what I consider one of the defining moments in hardcore, even indie music in general. <br />Converge, a heavy music juggernaut since the early 90's, has not only been around the hardcore equivalent of 49 years, they have grown and matured in a positive manner. They were never afraid of incorporating disparate ideas into their music, unlike their relative contemporaries Madball and the like. <br />They slowly but surely pushed themselves from the hardcore/punk cliche into something a lot harder to define, spearheading in this 2001 masterpiece. <br />Musically, it's as tight and precise as any speed metal group. <br />However, they never traverse the land of self-indulgent prog; when they play in 5/4, 7/8, whatever, it feels like a punk band playing in odd time, not the metalcore equivalent of 2112. <br />There's quite a bit of tongue-in-cheek riffs and sudden tempo changes, along with the dissonant chords and jagged rhythmic patterns that have become their trademark. <br />It's refreshing to find lyrical content that avoids the tough-guy cliches. Honestly, Throwdown lyrics are only one step away from Linkin Park's vague angsty whines. <br />This album, although not necessarily Converge's most profound lyrical statements, are artfully abstract, centered around a relationship, but avoiding the morbid emo crap by a clean mile. <br />Really, though, the lyrics don't matter so much, because for most of the album, they're completely unintelligible from Bannon's monstrous death shrieks without the aid of the lyric sheets. <br />What makes this album truly great are the songs; alone, each song is powerful, but in album order, they are absolutely devastating. <br />Instead of basing songs around their impressive chops a la Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge plays for the song, focusing on making each and every track a song, something hardly any hardcore groups can pull off nowadays. <br />Another one of their many amazing gifts is how they can stay so heavy, even when they're playing ridiculously slow (and by slow, I mean my-metronome-doesn't-go-that-low-slow) which makes songs like the title track stand out in such a solid album as it is. <br />Despite the fact that all their CDs are amazing (You Fail Me even has moments that surpass most everything on JD,) I still consider this album their most perfect release to date. <br />Anyone who enjoys heavy music at all must listen to these guys. <br />It might take a while to get used to, but it's worth it.
B00004RJ74|5.0|I always liked \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" but till yesterday when I rewatched it after long period of not watching I didn't realize how much I really do adore this movie. Only now I somehow understood how ingenious and perfect it is. Directing is great (as Robert Rodriguez admits in commentaries it was done with much of a help from Quentin Tarantino), cast is awesome: George Clooney is right on his place here, this was the first movie I saw him in and was pretty imoressed by his acting. For Tarantino as I think this was just the best work ever. Harvey Keitel is amazing as always. Not to mention Juliet Lewis, Denny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini and cameos by John Saxon and Kelly Preston. The film's done perfect technically and visually the plot is hilarious, call it whatever you want - comedy, horror, action, thriller, criminal film - it's all there. \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is a unique movie made by talents of many people involved. Such set of circumstances happens rather seldom like a solar eclipse. So enjoy!<br /><br />And on the edition itself I'd say it's one of the best I've seen speaking of amount of bonus features. Many deleted scenes (that are really interesting unlike in other movies' editions) with commentaries, on the set features, outtakes that are so funny they worth the whole picture... Anyway you won't be disappointed by this 2-disc edition. I guess I'll watch it again in a couple of weeks :)
B00009V7P8|1.0|i just felt like this guy needed a one star review
B000BW7QWW|1.0|I really can't understand all these rave reviews giving 5 stars and saying that Serenity is the best movie ever.  It is the sort of movie that you would expect on something like the Sci-Fi channel, certainly not something that I would expect to see at the cinemas and it is clear from the box office results that most people agreed with my view. <br />I was actually a fan of the firefly series, but Serenity was a huge disappointment and it felt like something that Joss Whedon had done in desperation, as firefly was not at all the sort of series that was made to be a theatrical release. <br />In reality I would probably give Serenity 2-3 stars but I thought I would give it 1 to counter all the ridiculous 5 star reviews. <br />Also be careful when looking at the dvd cover, as it doesn't at all represent what happens in the actual movie.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|The best thing I can say about this movie is that it will keep little kids out of your hair for a hour or so. It's fast, funny (if you're under 8) and visually interesting, but I've come to expect only the highest in quality from Disney animation and unfortunately Chicken Little is indeed a tiny achievement when compared to the vast libraby of classics in the Disney vault.  The characters aren't fleshed out and the story is a haphazard mess.<br /><br />Chicken Little's town is chock full of characters with many story possibilities but we never get to really know or care for them. They are all just one-note types (the goofy one, the nerdy one, the bully, etc.) and nothing more.<br /><br />For an 80 minute film, the story is way too padded and careens all over the place. The out of left field turn in the third act turns the film on it's head and takes it in a totally new direction.  Worse, quite a few sequences have no real point to the main story and seemed to be included only to provide action or humor.  There was a great chance to make Oaky Oaks feel like a fun community to live in that is never exploited.  Instead we get quick jokes and cultural refrences in the style of so many other CGI movies of recent years.<br /><br />This DVD includes an 18 minute making of feature, a few deleted scenes (one showing Chicken Little as a girl), a trivia game and music videos.  It's all done in a quick energetic style and if you enjoyed the film enough to check out these features, you'll probably enjoy them.  Just don't expect any major revelations or insight.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is not Pixar level movie making.  Chicken Little is not going to be anyone's favorite Disney feature animated film, but it may keep the young ones entertained for 80 minutes.
B000A2BNSG|5.0|I have two favourite movies and one of them is \\"Arizona Dream\\". I can watch it endlessly and very often. You know sometimes you got the mood when you just want to sit and watch something old, something you've seen many times, something very dear and familiar. \\"Arizona Dream\\" works for me at those occasions. Actually I don't like Emir Kusturica and his other works. Paradox, but I adore \\"Arizona Dream\\". It's the movie which seem to absorb all the wisdom of the world and at the same time all its contradictory. In a few words I can tell about the plot that the film is about our dreams. That we all pursue them and doing that we don't notice people around who also have their dreams. And very often our desires obstruct other men's desires. And we can never be happy. I know, maybe it sounds silly but it's not.<br />I can't say what happened to Kusturica in this feature but all 140 minutes of the film are flying very fast and you wish it was endless. Johnny Depp is very different, Vincent Gallo is ingenious as always (just watch his \\"North by Northwest\\" remake scene), Jerry Lewis is hilarious, Faye Dunaway and Lili Taylor make a perfect duo.<br />\\"Arizona Dream\\" is a kind of a movie every time you watch it you find something new, you discover new hidden meanings and layers. You won't get bored with it for sure. If you don't believe me - check imdb ratings. They are quite good and I'm sure none of those who voted loves this film as I do. If there was an ultimate movie for me to recommend for everyone - it'd be \\"Arizona Dream\\" without any doubt. I understand it's not a commercial project but still it's a shame such a brilliant picture is still not out on region 1 DVD.
0446677450|5.0|I have read some of the 5-star ratings as well as the 1-star ratings and I would like to add my 2 cents on what I think about this book. First, Robert Kiyosaki is no different than anyone else. Kiyosaki came up with an great idea and he sold it. Now whether the person agree or disagree is totally up to that person. I have brought several of Robert Kiyosaki's books and materials and I think his products are great. I have listened to other financial experts and again they also put their products and/or services out to the public to sell. This is the first time I have seen or read someone lay financial information down like Kiyosaki and tell like it is. Look I don't care what you do financially, you're rolling the dice either way. People always looking for someone else to tell them what to do and how to do it. Most of the stuff that Kiyosaki and other financial experts put out is very simple stuff. When was the last time the school system taught basic, fundamental financial education. I have seen students get straight As in advance math but can't balance a checkbook or understand how a mortgage work. High school graduates walk across the stage to get their diplomas and a credit card to go off to college with no financial knowledge or discipline. I have been on both sides of the fence when it comes to education and experience and believe both are vital for success in today's information age economy. In conclusion I will say this, whether you agree or disagree with Kiyosaki or any of the other financial experts. The bottom line: It's up to YOU in whether you are success or not. Kiyosaki just gives us another perspective. An opportunity is just that an opportunity. It's up to YOU to make that opportunity great or not!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|When was the last time you heard an album that was only ten songs long, but featured production by DJ Premier, and Q-Tip as well as being considered the greatest rap album of all time. Well, if you've heard Illmatic by Nasir \\"Nas\\" Jones, then this criteria is nothin' new. The thing about Illmatic was that this album was Nas' DEBUT!!! Not only would it be next to impossible to get Primo and Tip on one album; let alone on your debut. This album is truly amazing not only because of the star power, but Nas was able to show the world the lyricsm that East-Coast cats are expected to deliver now. His realistic 'hood tales fuel the appeal of the album, and the truth is what keeps the listener hooked. It is ironic that 50 Cent has a beef with God's Son, considering that he probably wouldn't have ever rapped if not for this album. In fact, I believe that rap would have never been recognized; so forget it being the staple of pop-culture if this album wasn't made. Ever rapper has studied this album; whether they want to admit it or not. Buy this, it is an essential for anyone who even says the words hip-hop or rap. \\"One Love\\" and \\"The World Is Yours\\" are the best known songs, but I think it is illegal to say that one song is better than the next. Classic. It is the rap bible. 'Nuf said. Buy it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was the greatest.  The FOX network and the movie industry must be completely full of retards to not have taken it seriously.  It causes me PAIN that they aren't being made anymore.  What the hell was FOX thinking, airing the second episode before the pilot?  Ohmygod.  I hope their network crashes into the ground and destroys  itself, so more good ideas will go to television networks that can recognize them.
B00000DR52|4.0|'The Last Emperor' is a very overrated movie, but this is a nice and soothing soundtrack that accompanies the film.  I was surprised David Byrne composed a few of the tracks.  Listen to it before going to bed.  One will have an easier time falling asleep.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Making your stand in regard to this here Cream is about politics rather than just craving blues. It's about getting  shievery 'n' stoned  by the \\"Politician\\" guitar line and lyrics (which I need more time to befittingly describe). True,  earlier renditions of the same worked better, but this time Cream compensates for the \\"spermishness\\" by sheer wisdom,  reading one another much better onstage. Which fact immediately graces the overall delivery. The only reservation I personally have is nothing to do with Eric foregoing Gibson for Strat or the like trivia. It's about virtually his and Bruce's vocals being indistinguishable. Aged or incipid? Well, Johnny Hallyday's 2000 performance at Olympia upset the \\"argument\\" for good - as well as Cream does now. Probably, we're blessed with audio here while rid of incessant predicament of oldage (on DVD release?). The sound of this one comes across as virile as the candid frontpage pic does. I can only wish the video were the same... but stick to audio still. Rock energy is not to do with age (as Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand prove). It's to do with CORRECT mentality. Which in turn picks up from the epoch. We almost succeeded in bringing world to perfection in the 60s' but it somehow retreived back, so mused Alvin Lee. It looks like Cream as outfit never paused at the job. Another contention is trademark transparent Reprise label sound quality with notably deepdown rolling lows and esthetically tipped 5 kHz while letting down by 2 dB on mid-highs and analog-like roll off after 10 kHz. So far I'm in position to judge.
0441012906|2.0|Although I am a big Reynolds fan, this one just seems to drag on and on. When you are well past page 200 and you're still wondering if anything is ever going to happen, you're forced to check to see if you're reading a psychology text. Nope, it's supposed to be a novel. <br /> <br />Many cereal boxes are more intriguing. <br />
0385513755|3.0|The biggest disappointment with this book is its dreadfully cheesy and anticlimactic ending.<br /><br />I can put up with weird interpretations of well known works of art for the sake of a story, however far-fetched they may be, but a bad ending is dreadful.<br /><br />And why is \\"The Last Supper\\" so crucial to the story? The painting is as relevant to the passion of Christ as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is to to the birth of Christ. Just look at the painting: it depicts a meal during the day being eat at a venue overlooking the ocean. The last supper was held at night in Jerusalem, not overlooking the Mediterranean. The \\"disciples\\" are eating fish and leavened bread, rather than unleavened bread and lamb, as required by a passover meal. Now we are supposed to believe this paining is trying to tell us the \\"truth\\" about Jesus. Give me a break.<br /><br />Having set these blunders aside, it still makes for an entertaining story. Pity the narrator for the audio version can't do a decent French accent.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Truly this is one of the greatest LPs out there. Not only have the songs been covered by so many artists, but they all can stand alone, or as part of an album. The Album starts with where Do The Children Play?  which is a great introspective look at development and technology, with a loss for the spiritual. Hard Headed Woman  is a great love song. Wild World  Listen is a wonderful song of a father to a daughter. Sad Lisa  is a Meloncholic look at a sad girl that the singer has feelings for. 'Miles From Nowhere' and 'On The Road To Find Out' show Cats spiritual quest.  <br />Longer Boats  is a great catchy song that is a lot darker and deeper than the tone of the song. It speaks of UFOs coming to get us.  <br />But I Might Die Tonight  is an interesting cynical look at the rat race that life has become.  Into White  is an interspective look.  <br />Father And Son  is the mark of Cat Stevens genius, it is a perfect song. Very few song capture the wonderful conversation between a father and a son. They both seem to make sense, and seem real, In a three minute song emotions, statments and positions are made and expressed.  <br />The finale of the Album is  Tea For The Tillerman  with its surprising end, seems a perfect end to a perfect album.  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was an original fan and almost cried when they cancelled Firefly.  I eagerly anticipated the movie and hooked all of my friends on Firefly.  Then it finally became the day when Serenity came out.  It was so good I did not move at all during the movie and when I tried to get up, I fell down, because I hadn't used my muscles in an hour.   <br />     It left some questions, but that is what you expect in a TV series gone movie.  I would have loved a second season of Firefly, even a complete first season, but Serenity at least satiates my hunger.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|\\"When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural.\\" Ra's Al Ghul, Batman begins.    And so it was with the Batman franchise as well. Having reached ground zero with 'Batman & Robin' (Which I consider to be the worst big budget film of all time), Warner Brothers put Batman back in his cave until the time was right. What a difference a decade makes.    Like X-Men & Spider-Man, Batman begins takes the 'Comic' out of 'comic book movie'. 'Begins' is a serious, but not somber, take on the Batman legend. Instead of hiring trippy \\"Visionaries\\" like Tim Burton or Joel \\"Woodstock flash-back\\" Schumacher, WB went with a filmmaker who had the ability to tell a story, Chris Nolan. Teamed with an expert in the genre, co-writer David Goyer, Nolan avoids the pitfalls of Ang Lee's disastrous 'Hulk' and delivers not only the year's best film, but the best 'Super hero' film of all time.    The movie is available as either a bare bones DVD, sans any extras, or a \\"Deluxe\\" two disc version that includes a disc full of twelve minute documentaries on the making of 'Begins' as well as a mini comic book. The deluxe version runs five to ten dollars more, and is only recommended for hard core fans. The movie, however, is recommended for everyone.
B00000JCOV|2.0|First off, let's just start off with this fact.  9 people.  9 people?  That, in my honest opinion, is overkill.  In fact, that is just one of many things that take away respect from this band.  They aren't necessarily bad musicians, but have you ever just tried to organize a trip with 9 people?  It's hard.  I have been writing music for sometime now, and I have been in bands ranging from 6 people, to 1, and I will tell you this much.  The fewer, the better.  I think they would be so much better if they ditched four of their most useless band members and went from there.  It is too hard to orchestrate with that many minds, especially when almost half suck.  All they have going for them is volume, and that's not saying very much.  I am very big on vocals/lyrics, and I am very concerned with how the music wraps with the idea in the music and what comes across in the end.  I don't feel anything from this music, as I feel that they just use their clown army image and wall of amps to fill the gap of quality music or any real talent.  Granted, it's fine if someone else likes them, and if you find something in there for you, great.  But there are much better choices in this world if all you are concerned about is how heavy is.  And for the one reviewer who professes the likes of Mars Volta or At The Drive In, what the heck are you thinking?  Not only are they media trash puppets, but they are no where near the sonic medium of Slipknot, but in your defense, not many bands are.
0156027321|5.0|This book is so rich in symbols and emotion and power --- and even fun --- that it's hard to find one path through it all. I don't think that Martel really wants one path --- and each time I consider the possible paths I come up with another theory. The conflicts in the lifeboat after the sinking of the freighter bring out the more abstract struggles between good and evil, innocent and powerful, man and God, life and death. The ocean is a universe and the lifeboat becomes a vessel that defines existence. The deaths of the zebra and the orangutang nearly pulled out my heart. In the end I missed Richard Parker as much as Pi did. Martel did a masterful job --- and he deserves accolades. His writing style is excellent and his storytelling matches anyone's. <br /> <br />
B000AMJDHY|4.0|There's definitely been a lot of hype over P!ATD. A LOT. They had three songs up on purevolume.com and within weeks they had a solid online fanbase. The vocalist is reminiscent of Stumph (Fall Out Boy, vocals) & overall they're a good band who've put out a rad album. Don't let the reviews sway you, go out and buy it, or check out their purevolume page, and judge for yourself ;)
0446677450|3.0|I believe that while Kiyosaki does an excellent job of emphasizing the importance of financial literacy and gives much helpful information, I think he tends to oversimplify the process of gaining financial freedom. The author is a shining example how hard work and determination can get people anywhere in life.  But I found myself, more often than not, noticing that sometimes in the book Kiyosaki made the goals so simple like infomercials on TV. All he says you have to do is follow some simple steps and you will reach financial freedom. He had many resources to jumpstart his career that the average citizen would not have access too. I enjoyed this book and I think Kiyosaki has many good ideas but I just think he tends to oversimplify the process of gaining financial freedom.
B00005JO17|3.0|It was not great, mind you.  Story-wise and even graphics-wise, Disney is no match for Pixar.<br /><br />But at the same time, the movie wasn't a complete dead weight that I thought it would be.  Indeed, the main story had a rather decent, fun structure to it.  I did enjoy the movie, I must admit.<br /><br />But if you are a type to find faults in movies, well, you'll be busy.  A lot of the supporting characters simply do not work.  Many jokes (both spoken lines and visual gags) fall flat, especially those that seemingly target adult audience members.  It tries too hard to push a family drama theme.  And it has too many pop-rock songs in the background that are there for the sole reason of selling the soundtrack CD.<br /><br />The level of graphics left me totally unimpressed too.  Not terrible, but nothing to write home about.  For instance, Chicken Little's feather/fur effects simply don't measure up to Pixar's 4-year-old Monsters Inc.  Plus, Chicken Little's rendering of fabrics and their interactions leave a lot to be wished for.<br /><br />I will say, however, that Disney has done a splendid job with facial expressions, as well as with the glossy quality of Chicken Little's eyes.  Very well done.<br /><br />All in all, even with all the faults, the basic story works, and Chicken Little is undeniably one cute character.  So, if you're in company of less-demanding crowd (like little kids or someone who just wants to see something cute), Chicken Little will do just fine.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this album back in '97 while on a business trip in Vancouver.  I heard their Virgin Record store there was fantastic so I thought I'd kill some time.  I had heard some of the buzz about Radiohead's new album - Ok Computer but never really got into their most popular US single - High and Dry but thought, what the heck...  This single decision opened my eyes, made me realize how much we're missing here in the US and how ridiculously superior British pop/rock is to the bogus corporate controlled crap from here in the states.  I've since become very opinionated in favor of the talent from the UK as compared to what we're stuck with here.  For instance, the one single from OK Computer that made it here on the airways was perhaps the worst song on the album - Karma Police.  Um, hello... what about Paranoid Android?  Subterranean Homesick Alien?  No Surprises?  So, then I realized, there's got to be so much more from across the pond that I'm missing.  Thank god for this revelation... now I'm blessed with listening to the likes of Muse, Thirteen Senses, Leaves, Longview, Elbow, Placebo, South and Keane... and I owe it all to OK Computer!  The most important and influential albums of the last 20 years!
B00097DXZS|1.0|I've been a fan of Carlos since 1968. I even have recordings of him before the Santana band. The man is truly one of the greatest guitarists of all time and a true inspiration, as well as the band (including this one) being one of the greatest bands of all time.  He is a true human being with dignity and grace. He even charted a course between 1972-1975 where no rock guitarist went before and none has gone since. His achievements are truly awesome. On Supernatural, he played with a vengeance, like a man who had something to prove even though no one believed him. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, that Carlos is missing from this album. The Santana band is even in absentia. Make no mistake, Carlos and the gang are all here, but for the performance they turn out, they might as well not be. It appears to be Clive Davis' album entirely. Carlos' sound is perfect, but he plays like a charicature of himself. Never once does he catch fire. The band appears to be on vacation. There is practically no tune that stands out, because all are stuffed with bad lyrics and bad hooks and bad gimmicks. This is one for the dumpster, Carlos,--right where I sent Shango. There are tunes that wear better than others: \\"I'm Feeling You\\" sounds childlike and simplistic compared to the rest, and because of that works better. \\"Trinity\\" is at least a listenable instrumental, but hardly worth getting excited about. Unfortunately, it's the only one. We don't get to hear the massive power of the Santana band at full tilt. There are no risks taken, nothing catches fire, and Carlos' leads seem pruned and slicked down for top 40 consumption. It's a Carlos we've seen before: It's a replay of Carlos in the 80's all over again, with every step a sure miss. If you want a good Carlos album, buy Caravanserai, Borboletta, or Lotus, or even Supernatural. But pass on this one. Like many of his albums in the 80's, it's not worth the price of the cellophane it's wrapped in.
B000BGR0OM|4.0|Aside from SHAMEFULLY leaving off Sexcrime (from their 1984 soundtrack), this collection just about what you would expect a single-disc Eurythmics greatest hits collection to have.  All the big and well-known songs are here.  Beethoven (I Love To Listen To) is missing, but was not a chart burner for them. <br /> <br />The remastering sounds GREAT.  The 2 new songs are good, especially I've Got A Life, which you may have heard on the radio.  Was It Just Another Love Affair, which is also very good, is a relaxing mid-tempo song with soothing vocals. <br /> <br />All in all a very good release, and with the upcoming remastered catalog with bonus tracks, a very exciting time for Eurythmics fans! (Although it will not be complete until they decide to remaster the 1984 soundtrack as well.)
B00006ADFL|5.0|this film was very well done by director peter jackson of the well known lord of the rings series. this was kate winslet's first role and i would say that it is one of her best.  this is an uncommonly heard of film that is well worth watching and will stay with you long after it is over.  the film is haunting, mysterious, and memorable.  i would recommend this film to anyone looking for something different but something great.
6305291446|4.0|After Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michael Myers, and Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers, Halloween H20 was a much needed installment for the series. With the last two films the series had started to take a slow decline, and H20 attempts to correct the mistakes the last films made, while taking Myers effectively into the new decade. It's been said before, but this is truly the best sequel in the series since Halloween II. It definitely has the classic feel that made the first two movies genuienly creepy, as well as great direction. That's the key, where as the last two films tended to focus on excessive (and sometime ridiculously stupid) violence, and completely confusing stories, Halloween H20 takes the series back to its basics and returns to what made the films scary in the first place; suspense. While it's not the best the series has ever offered (that honor of course belongs to the original) Halloween H20 is miles ahead of anything that was attempted in Halloween 4-6, and will definitely restore faith in anyone who thought the series was dying off slow and painfully. <br /> <br />Finally the story in a Halloween movie is clear. Forget anything that took place in Halloween 4-6. Halloween H20 completely erases those events (which I don't necessarily agree with, but hey it works) and picks up twenty years after the end of the second film. Apparently Michael Myers' body was never found at the scene of the accident in the last movie, which lead Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to fake her death and change her name and location to attempt to allude her brother, whom she believes is still alive. However after the death of Dr. Loomis, Myers has aquired papers from Loomis' home explaining exactly what his sister has been up to in the last twenty years. With that in hand he travels to California where Laurie is now the head of a secluded private school, and working under the name Keri Tate. And from there the fun insues. There are a couple of strange moments in the plot, mainly that the story leads you to believe at first that Myers true target is Laurie's son John (Josh Hartnett), although he quickly disappears before the movie is over. For the most part the scenes are extremely suspenseful (especially when Myers is trying to get into the gate when John and his girlfriend are outside Laurie's house), and the direction really creates some great moments throughout the film. The acting is better than anything seen in the last three movies, mainly because of Jamie Lee Curtis' return, although her performance isn't nearly as powerful as the original (but it can be forgiven). Cleaning up the story as well made the film a lot better, because there's no confusion about what's going on; Michael is there to kill Laurie Strode, and anyone else who gets in his way. The cast plays their parts especially well, including Josh Harnett and Michelle Williams, and even LL Cool J (although his character is ridiculously stupid in this movie). The real star of the show is Jamie Lee Curtis though. She definitely adds a whole new dimension to the film because her acting is one of a kind, and having her return to do this film makes it feel more like the original. <br /> <br />While it's not the best the series has seen, and it definitely has it's flaws, Halloween H20 is way ahead of anything that 4-6 tried to do. I was glad to see the series get back on track with this one. If you were a fan of the original Halloween or any of the later sequels, I think you'll find yourself pleasently surprised by this one. My expectations for this film were pretty low considering what I had to go on off of Halloween 5 and 6, but it went above and beyond anything I believed it could have. Too bad Halloween: Resurrection effectively killed everything this movie accomplished, but no matter. Even without Resurrection this film stands on its own as a great addition to the Halloween family.
B000BNX3AU|4.0|this movie really could have been so much better than it was.  i have always been a huge fan of both diane lane and john cusack.  this movie however, made their acting skills seem laughable.  i believe that this movie could have been so much better if the script had been written by someone else.  the story was sweet but not exactly memorable.  the movie is enjoyable but in the end disappointing.  this film is good for laughs but not one of the year's best.
0689862725|4.0|I finished this book a couple of nights ago and I found it to be wonderfully written and with a very good story line. This is not typical King, it does not have the intense shock value of books like \\"The Regulaters\\" or \\"Pet semetery\\" {\\"Pet Semetery\\" being my favorite King book} I can understand how some found the book slow and lacking in the shock department, I will admit that the girl acts and thinks in a way that is older then a nine year old but this is a great read non the less. If you are new to King, check out \\"Pet Semetery\\" and \\"Cujo\\" before you read this one and I think you will be able to enjoy it more.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|tim burton has always been one of my favorite directors.  this film is deffinately one of his best.  johnny depp is casted perfectly in the role of willy wonka.  this film is hillarious and sweet and is great to watch with the family.  i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film with tons of laughs!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is ok for a b-movie.Half-a-movie at full-price -- it's annoyingly unsatisfying. Also self-indulgent, sadistic, juvenile, pretty to look at, and empty as a beer can on my front porch. Its ok to rent and spank to this movie, but if your looking for a keeper, check into Vivid's line of movies starring Jenna Jameson, Celeste, and Chasey Lain, and Debbie Diamond.Your little guy will thank you
B00001U0E1|5.0|this film is wonderful in every way.  gwyneth paltrow and joseph fiennes are wonderful in this film as well as geoffrey rush, judi dench, and ben affleck.  this film deserves is recognition and should have recieved more awards that given.  this is deffinately the best film inspised by a shakespeare play, and is uniquely original in it's way of telling the story of one of the history's most famous plays.  the film, acting, and story line is great!  i highly recommend seeing this film!
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis-(What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) Another album that makes me feel high on life, although this one's a bit more sonically devastating. The best band of the `90's in my opinion, the kings of \\"brit-pop\\" peaked during this album. Every track a gem in its own way, \\"Wonderwall\\" hit it big during the fall of '95. \\"Cast No Shadow,\\" dedicated to The Verve's Richard Ashcroft, is another gorgeous ballad. Yes, \\"She's Electric\\" sounds like something off of Sgt. Pepper, but I consider the Beatles' influence a tribute, not a rip-off. Liam Gallagher's Cockney accent and sneering lyrics give the songs a rock `n' roll attitude, while elder brother Noel (who write all the tunes) is a guitar hero who can jam with the best of them. Noel has a penchant for catchy melodies, with every song being a possible hit. The lyrics can be arrogant and boastful, but they are mostly about setting yourself free and being your own person. Oasis has brought back the rock star attitude and swagger, while at the same time, maintaining a positive message, soaring guitars, and a pounding beat. That, to me, is what rock `n' roll has always been about.

0596007124|5.0|The method used by the authors is very useful. Now I have in my brain (as they told at the begining) what the patters are and why we should use them.<br /><br />My only complain is that is excessively java oriented. Some interesting examples (MVC and some other) are very difficult to follow due to the platform commintment.<br /><br />Anyway the concept is still there and there are many sources to fix this concept with an example exercise.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This is the worst movie NOT about Jesus ever made! Instead of making a film about Christ's life and/or his message, Mel Gibson makes a slasher flick about what the government can do to another human being. If you are a twisted person who enjoys watching over 2 hours of obsessive blood & torture, then you will love this absurd gore-fest. Otherwise, it's an obscene, narrowly focused, remote, spiritually uninvolving, and amateurish  waste of time. The acting is average and there is an anti-Semitic message simmering at the surface of this mess. Even Satan is portrayed as a cliche---an ambisexual hooded figure lurking in the background of several scenes. There is nothing new here except that all of the actors speak in Aramaic, which is distracting since you must read subtitles. The slow motion scenes are so self-conscious that the film becomes tedious to watch after awhile. Plus, there are historical inaccuracies contained within, like the fact that Romans did not nail spikes into Jesus' hands but his wrists. Overall, this movie told me next-to-nothing about the man called Jesus of Nazareth. The only vaguely interesting part of the film was the music, which reminded of the excellent music from \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" composed by Peter Gabriel. (The CD is titled \\"Passion\\".) In fact, if you want to watch a deeply moving, spiritual film, rent or buy \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\", which was a gritty, realistic interpretation of Jesus' life, and contained a rare look at the human side of Jesus. (It seemed to me that Gibson was influenced by this movie and decided to do his own version but failed miserably.)
B0007PAMR4|1.0|Yes, I am a Dune fanatic.  I have watched David Lynch's original more times than I can count.  However, if you are looking for a movie that got better with the deleted scenes put in (like Lord of the Rings) then don't bother with this version.  I was horribly disgusted with what the production company did to Lynch's original that I don't think I'll watch the extended version ever again.<br /><br />To sum up points that were made by other people that I found as well:<br /><br />1. The replacement narrator killed the flow of the movie.  I kept thinking that his style belonged more in a video game than anything.<br /><br />2. The replacement score was constantly playing.  There would be scenes where nothing extra special was happening and the background music was preparing you for battle.<br /><br />3. The scene edits were horrible.  Extra bits were put in where they didn't belong and they cut was horrible!  In the first 10-15 minutes I saw the same Harkonnen ship approach Arakeen 2-3 times, and this is happening when Arrakis didn't have anything to do with the scene.<br /><br />4. The movie was explained to death.  Every character was introduced with a relationship.  I have never seen a movie that just said \\"This is x and he is blah blah blah in relation to y.  He also likes to play golf.\\"<br /><br />5. The dubbing was horible.  There was a part at the beginning where the emperor was talking to the guild navigator and he originally says \\"House Atreides\\" or \\"the harkonnens.\\"  What is put in is \\"Duke Atreides\\" or \\"Baron Harkonnen.\\"  One line in that speech says something to the effect that \\"I have ordered Duke Atreides to replace THEIR ENEMIES the Baron Harkonnen.\\"  Whose idea was this?<br /><br />I wish there was a way to let Universal that they have already killed this movie twice since the original and lost a lot of the money they hoped to gain.<br /><br />To a previous poster, E. Dolnack, the special effects were still very good for the time it was made.  The budget was about $50 million which I believe was one of the largest to date.  Lynch still had to make cuts and use substandard equipment.  Also, if you read the book, you will see that they are supposed to \\"whisper\\" in their heads.<br /><br />The actors did an amazing job in creating their characters.  The amount of emotion mixed with the score really takes you inside the movie.  Also, the costumes were spectacular!  Rarely do you see such diversity and detail put into wardrobe.  For these reasons and more I love Lynch's version over the Sci-fi one.<br /><br />Save your money and hope that one day David Lynch will be able to make a Director's Cut of the film.  It's a longshot, but I would love to see it.  This Extended Edition is not worth the money.ade.  The budget was about $50 million which I believe was one of the largest to date.

B00008WT5C|5.0|Heres the thing. When you have the digipack, you can use it to unlock certain pages at the official AC/DC website. I forgot about this; every album includes something different. This particular one unlocks the rare songs CRABSODY IN BLUE and CARRY ME HOME. The first one is a slow bluesy song about (take a guess) and the second one is one of the greatest god damned hell foresaken tracks EVER! I never understood why this song was never released on any albums in the U.S.<br />Oh well, you can at least hear it if you have a computer, which I assume you do since you are here reading this.<br />This album LET THERE BE ROCK is a great addition to the AC/DC collection all the same. Powerfull RAW rock and roll riffs that tear most everything else ever apart. Probably even the heaviest AC/DC riffs ever! Bon Scott as always is the man.<br />You really should ONLY listen to this when it is VERY VERY LOUD. I know I say that a lot, but with this album, it really does not have any effect unless it is EXTREMELY LOUD, in which case it sends pulses and vibes of raw energy strait through you!<br /><br />OOOOOOOOOH YEEEEEEAAAAA-YAAAAA

B000060MMI|5.0|Coming from a lot of Irish background it was not uncommon to hear a lot of traditional Irish folk music growing up. Especially on holidays like St. Patricks Day when everyone would get completley sloshed and want to sing these old traditional Irish songs.<br />It is due to this reason I assume that certain bands hold special meaning to me. Like old school Drop Kicks and other bands that rip up traditional irish music and make it rock really hard.<br />The best account of this breed of rock music would have to be this album by FLOGGING MOLLY, called DRUNKEN LULLABYS.<br />It is packed with heartfelt and fist clenched songs that are sure to please ANYBODY!<br />Some of it is very punkish, lots of group SHOUT-ALONGS, and soft ballads turn into high energy killers on the title track and WHATS LEFT OF THE FLAG.<br />There are folky acoustic numbers like IF I EVER LEAVE THIS WORLD ALIVE, and even some turkish devil music like ANOTHER BAG OF BRICKS.<br />All in all this whole album is incredible, if you are curious about this band I would get this one first and then if you like this their first album; SWAGGER is also very good.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|this soundtrack is quite sad. some of the music is slow, while others are quick and witty. my favorite is \\"The Wings\\". its a takeoff on blackbird by the Beatles.  it is a lovely song and i like it a lot.
B000000OSG|5.0|Most people will tell you that UYI1 is the better of the two discs, while I think that 1 is an excellent disc, it is most definatley about no.2.<br /><br />Honestly, you really shouldn't be without either one, but if you can't afford the pair, I would start with number two. It has less radio fare, and in my opinion is a much more interesting peice. Since my copy is on vinyl; lets drop the needle, shall we....<br /><br />First song is CIVIL WAR, this is a softer rocker, yet very cool. The opening sample from Cool Hand Luke kicks the whole thing off right.<br /><br />14 YEARS: Good song man. It's funny that when this first came out I used to think, fourteen years was such a long time... thats how old this album is now.<br /><br />YESTERDAYS: Nice ballady number. Its true the first couple of songs work you in slowly.. don't worry.<br /><br />KNOCKIN': Hey, I'm always about a Bob Dylan cover, and here it is done to perfection.<br /><br />GET IN THE RING: OH YEAH BABY! This song WILL be played at my wedding or else I ain't never getting married. A girl I used to go out with way back in the day was down with the plan, its to bad she dissapeared on my ASS! Oh well, one of my favorites for sure!<br /><br />SHOTGUN BLUES: Well, somewhat generic, but its placement here is good, right between RING and BREAKDOWN, you need a little breather.<br /><br />BREAKDOWN: Is a mellow tune but one of my favorites. Some of the best GUNS lyrics.<br /><br />PRETTY TIED UP: Don't listen to what everybody else says. This song is cool. Banjo's are pisser!<br /><br />LOCOMOTIVE: Well, it ain't the best, and it is a little long, but give it a chance, it ain't as bad as everyone says.<br /><br />SO FINE: TAkes you right back in....YEEEEAAAAHHH......<br /><br />ESTRANGED: It ain't stoppin', first SO FINE and now ESTRANGED! Many people claim this as the BEST GNR track ever, well it certainly is close.. undoubtedly one HELL of a great epic. Nine and some odd minutes, it may get your chicks pants off too and its a hundred times better than November Rain, (not that theres anything wrong with THAT song.)<br /><br />YOU COULD BE MINE: OH COME ON NOW! I love it when girls get nasty with this song! Its way intense and good old fashion SLEAZE! Its awesome to know that on such an eclectic album GUNS could still shred it up like the old days!

0393035158|5.0|Yesterday I finished Sam Harris' work,\\"The End of Faith\\" ... and noted I had underlined nearly a quarter of the text.  As an active conservative Christian, it was important for me to read an author with a different view. I commend Sam for his courage to wade into conversations where we all know we shouldn't go.  Anyone truly interested in the future good of our global community would benefit from reading the thoughts Sam has recorded here. His ability to help us clear our minds of what holds us back is a rare gift. I truly believe Sam only means to help people of faith and those whose lives their actions impact ... and that Christians would do well to spend as much time evaluating their faith as they do practicing it.
B000002UA0|5.0|Pink Floyd was once the greatest psychadelic rock band in all the land. That was when Syd Barrett was the guitarist/songwriter. \\"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\" was with Syd...you see where I'm going with this. This album is the most far out, awesome, spacy, pop music that you will ever hear. People who pledge their Pink Floyd devotion to \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" need to seriously reconsider, because David Gilmour's guitar playing and Roger Waters' songwriting is seriously sub-par when compared to that of Syd. \\"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn,\\" if not the best, is at least my favorite, so see if you feel the same way.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|While it may fall into some other psychological film categories, it's definitely a unique film in it's ownright.  From it's quirky characters, to it's unusual settings (including a lot in Bale's blue collar worker's place of employment: a machine shop), to it's visual look and direction, this is very close to being called a true, one of a kind film.  It is a dark film, with some dark scenery, but I was actually surprised to find that the overall look was nowhere near as bleak as one would be led to believe from the film's promotion and reviews.  It's kind of like Anderson's film Session 9, which set in an abandoned mental institution, you would think it would be a dark looking film, but it really isn't.   <br /> <br />Christian Bale, Michael Ironside, and Jennifer Jason Leigh all give top notch performances and make you forget about it being a slow moving film, shot in hotel rooms, dingy apartments, and a grungy machine shop.  The actor who plays Bale's psychological nemesis is also excellent.  He is the one Bale keeps seeing show up at work, while no one else does. <br /> <br />The film is strong enough to keep your interest thorughout, with interesting dialog, character development, and the mystery element.  While not the most thrilling or complex of psychological puzzles, the end is rather simple, yet very satisfying, and it thankfully does not go the artistic route and come up with some preposterous twist ending.  <br /> <br />This is not a movie for everyone, but it's a fine piece of cinema and deserves to be seen.
B000002A3T|1.0|OH MY GOD! I picked up this album cause I had a couple extra dollars and thought I could add on to my Pink Floyd collection. What a huge mistake that was. This is probably my least favorite of any album I've ever listened to. It is what would happen if you took KD Lang and Bob Dylan and pushed them into a tiny padded room with nothing but an 8 track recording system, a guitar, and some terrible smooth-jazz saxophone samples. David Gilmour is a total jerk, because this album is in no way similar to Pink Floyd as Syd Barret would've had it. Syd was a genius, David is a loser. Don't buy this unless you are getting it for your arch nemesis' birthday, and even then, nobody deserves this crap. Buy \\"Piper At The Gates of Dawn\\" or \\"Saucerful of Secrets.\\"
B00016ZQXO|4.0|This isn't one of Queen's strongest albums but it isn't one of their bad ones either.  Some of their strongest ever hits are here although as one cohesive piece of work this one isn't.  Still, this version of the album has a very well done mini-lp sleeve packaging that is very faithful to the original lp design complete with colour photo of that \\"Bicycle Race\\".  Every track is well remastered although perhaps due to limitations of the master tape, some tracks start out soft and then get louder while some tracks sound better produced than others but it's hardly noticeable unless you're looking out for these things.  Overall this is still the best version that is out there of this album.  Recommended and a must if you are a Queen fan.
0671027573|5.0|I won't go into plot details or spoilers of any kind. Suffice to say that if you enjoy romantic suspense with a twist of humor, this book is for you.  I've read several books in the romance genre, but often find them too contrived, sappy or just plain silly. Linda Howard does a neat hat trick by tying the mystery elements (which were a bit creepy) with the comedic romance very nicely. Some of the scenes between the main characters Jaine Bright and her romantic interest cop Sam Donovan were just hilarious - I mean laugh-out-loud.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this book. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|The Paltrow version is really quite nice and enjoyable, but I can't help feeling that something is slightly amiss, a bit out of place. As if the actors - though very good ones at that - couldn't wholly identify with the characters they played. Sometimes they just seemed to be telling their lines without their hearts being in it. There is one exception and that is the excellent Jeremy Northam. Although his Mr Knigthley is certainly not as charismatic as that of Mark Strong in the other version of Emma, he was great.<br /><br />Toni Colette, though a very good actress, was really miscast as Harriet Smith and not just physically. She is a modern actress and couldn't fit into this period drama. The same is true for Ewan McGregor: a great actor, but not one for period drama, or at least not for regency drama, I fear.<br /><br />The film is not strictly faithful to the plot, which in itself wouldn't be a problem, but it weakens the performance even further altogether. Still, if you do not have too high expectations, you may enjoy this film without further ado.
0446577383|5.0|So, Why the Camel Club?\\" is finally asked by a perceptive soul at the conclusion of this book. The first answer he got was. \\"Because camels have great stamina.They never give up.\\" The second was, \\"In the 1920's there was another Camel Club. And at each meting of that club they would all raise their glasses and take a vow to oppose Prohibition to the last drop of whiskey. Now that's my knid of club.\\" <br /> <br />Well, the group may have adopted the name for these reasons or for others, but they are an interesting and eclectic assortment of people. In the course of the telling of the tale, this rag tag assortment of folks manage to ...uh oh, I am almost telling you too much. <br /> <br />Let's just say that this story starts with the pace of a steam engine with a long load of fully loaded box cars starting from the station. Chug, chug, chug. However, by mid-story the pace is picking up and in the last quarter of the book it is a flat out page turner.   <br /> <br />David Baldacci has written eleven novels with this one and most have been well worth reading. He has a couple of clunkers, in my humble opinion, but even though he uses this novel to put forth some of his political opinions about the war in Iraq and the wisdom of US policy in that regard (which I don't agree with) nevertheles he delivers a very compelling and scary novel about how things could be and hopefully never will. <br /> <br />This is one time you hope that fiction will never become fact, but it is worth your time to read it and decide.
B00005MP58|4.0|This film is a brilliant and dynamic adaptation of Jane Austen's P&P. Andrew Davies dreamt up a fantastic script, faithful to the plot and period, yet it is fresh and modern at the same time. I very much enjoyed the \\"show it rather than tell\\" scenes and all the extra scenes Davies came up with, like the introductory scene with Bingley & Darcy or the fencing scene telling a lot of things about their status, characters and feelings. The dramatisation of all the letters was also very enjoyable: showing events rather than the actors' having to read them endlessly without any actions. I also liked the way the Bennet girls were presented, how even the most everyday activities highlighted their characters.<br /><br />I also liked the way Darcy - played superbly by Colin Firth by the way! - was given more attention than just appearing occasionally at the scene. This way we were more familiar with his character, actions and his feelings for Elizabeth. As a result the surprise element is not so significant of course, but it did not lessen the merits of the production.<br /><br />Costumes, music, buildings and scenery were absolutely fantastic. They were not simply objects and background, they also disclosed a lot of useful information about the characters (e.g.: Darcy is wealthy, but has taste, lady Catherine is wealthy and pompous, Elizabeth is not very rich, but is natural and unpretentious...).<br /><br />The actors were also very good, although I have to admit that I thought Jennifer Ehle miscast as Elizabeth Bennet: she seemed too experienced, too knowing for a twenty-odd something-year-old girl. At times she was simply impertinent instead of daring and she just SMIRKED instead of smiling playfully. Thus Darcy appeared a far more positive character to me right from the start despite his aloof behaviour. Elizabeth Garvie in the '79 version was absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />And there was another miscast character: Wickham. He was just too slimy. I mean, he IS slimy all right, but in the beginning Elizabeth and the audience shouldn't know that. He should appear as a much more attractive person compared to Darcy. Adrian Lukis couldn't do that, he was a bit repulsive right from the start. So I was left with the feeling \\"how could Lizzy fall for this guy's charm even for a second?!\\" You aren't supposed to feel that from the start, you shouldn't be thinking, even as a spectator, that Elizabeth must be really foolish to like this guy instead of the charismatic and sexy Darcy!<br /><br />All in all, if you love the book, you are going to like this adaptation very much.ht, but in the beginning Elizabeth and the audience shouldn't know that.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Who'd have thunk that Preston, Idaho could generate such a quirky gem of a flick?  While this comedy isn't for everyone, it was for me.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite lives in a cow town with his grandma and his thirty-something year old stay-at-home brother Kip.  Napoleon hasn't got much going for him besides his own imagined \\"skills\\" and a tremendous imagination.  When his grandma gets injured on a day trip, Creepy Uncle Rico comes to take care of Kip and Napoleon.  Add to that Napoleon's accidental friendship with the new kid, Pedro and you've got a recipe for a fine little tale that involves a rip-off time travel machine, disco dancing, true love (over the internet), suit shopping at a thrift store, and chicken farming.  The music collected for this film is eclectic and light.  The soundtrack - with sound bites taken from the movie between songs - is a precious addition to the film.<br /><br />Doesn't sound like much?  That's the magic.  The \\"high point\\" of the film is a risky run for class president.  But along the way, Napoleon gets to demonstrate his odd sort of faithfulness to his friends and a willingness to dare to dream.<br /><br />Oh, and listen to the commentary on the DVD.  Jon Heder (Napoleon) and Jared Hess' commentary are hilarious.  Score one for the little guys.
0767020308|5.0|The crew, namely Andrew Davies as scriptwriter and Sue Birtwistle as producer, that adapted Pride & Prejudice (1995) on film did a fantastic job again.<br /><br />Andrew Davies came up with yet another delightful, fresh and lively script.<br /><br />The scenery was picturesque reflecting the social position and financial means of the characters, just like the costumes did, disclosing also lot of info about characters. Just think of the overdone robes and droll headdresses Lucy Robinson, as Mrs Elton, was wearing: showing her lack of taste and her desire in aspiring for higher status than she actually represents! And the elegant yet moderate clothes of Jane Fairfax showing no lack of taste, but of means. Simply brilliant!<br /><br />All actors were superbly cast. Kate Beckinsale, as Emma and Mark Strong as Mr Knightley, Prunella Scales as Mrs Bates, Bernard Hepton, Samantha Morton, Raymond Coulthard ... and I could go on and on were all excellent, you could truly associate them with the role they played.<br /><br />The adaptation as a whole had more depth than the Paltrow version and was more true to Jane Austen's spirit.<br /><br />If you are a true Austen fan, you mustn't miss this film!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|It took me a long time to get over Depp in 21 Jump Street, 20 years ago.  I'm well over it now, and he just keeps hitting them out of the park as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />I was a fan of the Gene Wilder film version of this story, and wasn't quite sure how I'd feel about this newer film.  The flick feels like a Tim Burton adventure from the get-go, from the Danny Elfman music to the dumpy, lopsided house in congested isolation right next to the middle of the action, to the dark-yet-lush, Burtonesque colors.<br /><br />It might have been risky casting Freddie Highmore (Depp's young co-star in Finding Neverland) as Charlie, but the young actor was perfect in the role.  In fact, I can't complain about any of the casting.  Helena Bonham Carter was the grunged up, wonderfully understated mom of Charlie, and the boy's whole extended family all fit nicely.  Christopher Lee took his place dutifully and expertly as Willie Wonka's estranged father.  Everything fit here.  The riskiest move was using Deep Roy, long-time English short-guy, as all of the Oompa Loompas, but I believe he pulled it off.<br /><br />Depp, though, carried the movie for me.  He could have been a silly Willie Wonka, or he could have not given nearly enough.  I think that he did a triple flip and stuck it.  He was childishly enthusiastic, wounded, simultaneously guarded and open... and ultimately captivated by young Charlie.
0307276902|5.0|I read and heard all of the hoopla about this book from Oprah, etc...  With their reviews of the book, I had to have it, after receiving the book on a Friday, the book closed Sunday afternoon.  I simply COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.  The brutal, heart-wrenching and graphic honesty of James Frey should be comdended.  I have started \\"friendship books\\"  I pass the book around to family and friends, each person that reads the book, signs it, highlights in it, writes comments on the inside, etc... when the book (like this phenomenal book) makes its way around, I have the precious book to keep.
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|After four tries it seems they finally came up with a Batman to remember.  Christian Bale not only cuts a fine figure but gives the role the gravity it deserves, providing the much needed raison d'etre for the Dark Knight.  Unfortunately, the plot was a bit far-fetched and not very well resolved.  Christopher Nolan put together an excellent supporting cast with Michael Caine giving Alfred a nice comic touch and Gary Oldman as a young Detective Gordon.  But, it is the extra touches which really make this movie, like Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, who helps Batman come up with the armor and gadgets he needs to take on the underworld of Gotham. I also thought Cillian Murphy did a great job as Dr. Jonathon Crane, the genesis for the Joker.  However, I wasn't particularly smitten by Katie Holmes and Mark Boone Junior turned Flass into a joke, whereas he was a much darker and more sinister character in Frank Miller's Batman: Year One.  It will be interesting to see where they take Batman from here.
0156027321|4.0|***Possible spoilers ahead...but not too many**** <br />After I finished this fascinating novel, I decided to take a look at what others had said and peruse the ratings/reviews here. To no surprise, the reviews are very mixed, but mostly positive. The negative reviews are mostly the kind of reviews that always puzzle me, not actually reviewing the book, but pointing out that it isn't the book that they WANT it to be, which are entirely different things. But I digress..  <br />This is certainly a book for a pluralistic world, as young Piscine Patel absorbs the major religions represented in his village, and when confronted by three religious leaders and his parents, wonders why he can't be a Hindu, and a Christian, and a Muslim. They all seem ok to him, so he wants to believe them all.  <br />His response to Jesus is very notable: \\"I couldn't get Him out of my head. Still can't. I spent three solid days thinking about Him. The more He bothered me, the less I could forget Him. And the more I learned about Him, the less I wanted to leave Him.\\"  <br />Of course, Pi does not believe that these religions can't be all-inclusive, much to the frustration of all three religious leaders. Pi's faith becomes based in an amalgamation of all three religions, and he is critical of those who think only one of these religions can be true.  <br />Theological confusion aside, the book is an intriguing look at zoos, survival at sea, animal instinct, and much more. It is a survival book, an adventure book, a fairy tale, a tragedy, a comedy.  <br />Young Pi is left on a lifeboat following a shipwreck. The only other occupants of the lifeboat are a hyena, a zebra, an orangutang, and a tiger. Adventure and mishaps ensue.  <br />There is much violence. Not the violence born of man, but the natural violence born of the will and desire to survive.  <br />There are many parts of the book that are disturbing, some puzzling, others frustrating (what's up with the algae island and the blind Frenchman?), which push the story from highly unlikely to impossible. You know from the start that Pi survives the ordeal, you just aren't quite sure how he will, and that curiosity keeps the pages turning.  <br />There is an interesting and not-quite-satisfying (likely the intention) twist at the conclusion that leaves the question of what is true hanging out there for even more speculation.  <br />4 stars. Joe Bob says check it out.  <br /> <br />Favorite quotes:  <br />\\"I have nothing to say of my working life, only that a tie is a noose, and inverted though it is, it will hang a man nontheless if he's not careful.\\"  <br /> <br />On agnosticism: \\"To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\\"  <br />
6304806418|3.0|All in all this is a pretty good adaptation of the stage show. A meaty storyline, we all seem to relish in the tales of heroines who die young, a sumptuous latin setting and the winning combination of Tim Rice And Andrew Lloyd Webber. <br /> <br />Madonna gives her best performance on film ever, but still manages to miss the mark. I enjoy Madonna, but just felt that she was not feminine enough, not pretty enough and was unable to sing strongly enough. I was never convinced it was Evita on the screen, always Madonna. I personally felt that all Madonna's years in the gym worked against her, as I was unable to ever see the fragility and vulnerability that Evita fought, and eventually succumbed to, all her life. I also think Madonna has a fine voice for pop music but fell short of her requirement in this role, too many times I awaited a high point or crescendo, and was left with a flat note or weak attempt. Although she did sound great on some of the less challenging numbers. <br /> <br />Jonathon Pryce, who plays Peron, seemed uncomfortable in his role. I found myself wondering if he was trying to not overshadow his co-star. Unfortunately this left his performance flat and wooden, and nowhere near the level of expertise we have come to expect from him. <br /> <br />As for Antonio Banderas, WOW. He stole the show, he is electric, passionate, humorous and who knew he could sing. He actually shows up Madonna when it comes to the singing, a rather sad statement, but true. <br /> <br />All in all, the movie is well worth viewing, and I do not regret buying the DVD. With the stunning backdrop, lavish sets, catchy songs and Antonio's bravura performance, I am sure I will relish this movie many times over. It's just so hard not to wonder what could have been.
B0000004V2|5.0|if miles davis' 'a kind of blue' is the definitive jazz album, the roses self-titled debut is the definitive post-1985 brit-rock album.  most of the 200+ reviews here on amazon are written, i assume, by dyed-in-the-wool roses fans.  consequently a lot of the reviews are biased--and that's understandable.  so, to those who've never heard the roses,  here's why you should pick up this album.<br /><br />1) the marriage of dance and rock. the roses were among the first to incorporate dance beats into classic guitar rock, and we can thank reni for that (a hugely underappreciated drummer). it's most evident in 'fool's gold,' -- still one of the greatest songs ever written.<br /><br />2) john squire. mr. squire is a *witch* on the guitar. his solo during the last five minutes of 'i am the resurrection' leaves little doubt the man sold his soul to the devil. if the devil does indeed find work for idle hand to do, john squire must have been one idle little kid.<br /><br />3) the songs.  top to bottom there's really not a dull moment. 'i wanna be adored' is probably one of the greatest album openers ever, and signals a rallying cry to what would become their legion of fans. it builds slowly, like an train picking up speed, before exploding into john squire's signature riffage. after that thrilling into, the band never let up. the sequencing is brilliant and relentless. 'she bangs the drums,' 'elephant stone,' made of stone,' 'shoot you down' (itself a highly jazzy number), and 'sugar spun sister' (and it's curious 'sticky-fingered boy' lyric) are the perfect blend of dance and rock.  the production is *perfect.* the album never gets bogged down with brass, strings, etc.  this is the classic four man lineup--guitar, bass, vocals, drum. no filler, no fluff.<br /><br />4) sheer enthusiasm and exuberance. they were a band primed for greatness and in listening to songs like 'i wanna be adored' and 'i am the resurrection,' you get the feeling the band knew it--and they were right, which makes it's all the more astonishing.  it's very much a statement album, a statement that forever changed the british musical landscape. i don't think it's stretch to say that without the roses, there would be no oasis, no blur, no verve, no suede, no charlatans.<br /><br />5) let's face it--this album's got cache. any self-respecting music fan *has* to have this album. not only is it essential listening, it will get you bucketloads of cool points--at least in certain circles.<br /><br />the roses, sadly defunct (can a reunion really be that far off?), remain as influential 15 years after their debut as the were the day it was released.  i assume this is an album each successive generation will discover anew.re right, which makes it's all the more astonishing.  it's very much a statement album, a statement that forever changed the british musical landscape. i don't think it's stretch to say that without the roses, there would be no oasis, no blur, no verve, no suede, no charlatans.   <br /> <br />5) let's face it--this album's got cache. any self-respecting music fan *has* to have this album. not only is it essential listening, it will get you bucketloads of cool points--at least in certain circles. <br /> <br />the roses, sadly defunct (can a reunion really be that far off?), remain as influential 15 years after their debut as the were the day it was released.  i assume this is an album each successive generation will discover anew.
0064409422|5.0|I read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" twice, and now that it is coming to the theaters in December, I'd like to read it again before seeing the movie.  This is an absolutely splendid, spellbinding read for people of all ages.  Four children discover the magical land of Narnia behind the doors of a wardrobe in an empty room.  It is ruled by an evil ice queen, and Narnia hasn't seen any signs of spring since she has begun to rule the mythical land.  I don't want to give anything away, but this book is full of twists and turns and it will keep you hooked until the very last page.  But know this: the children are on a quest to bring the sun back into this magical world, and along the way, there's plenty of adventure to keep the reader turning the pages until late in the evening!  Highly recommended.
B0001I55OC|1.0|I'm reluctant to call this the worst movie I've ever seen, since I've been witness to quite a few crap-fests, but Timeline has got to be in the top 10 at least.  You know a movie is going to suck when Paul \\"zero talent\\" Walker is the best actor in the whole film.  I'm not kidding.  Walker has become one of my favorites in Hollywood simply due to his comedically bad acting in every single movie he's ever made.  And his acting skills blow every one else's away in this movie.  It's like they just picked a bunch of shmoes off the street and said, \\"Hey guys, you're all going to star in this terrible movie called Timeline with Paul Walker.  Don't worry if you can't act, no one will notice because the movie's so bad anyways and they'll all be focused on the stupid dialogue and Paul's pathetic attempt to appear believable.  Welcome aboard!\\" <br /> <br />I got tricked into seeing this one because I'm a sucker for medieval war films, even if they're terrible.  But this one takes the cake.  I won't go into all the terrible plot mistakes and innaccuracies, but my absolute favorite part of the movie occurs when some guys are attacking a castle at night with flaming arrows.  Nevermind the fact that flaming arrows aren't going to do much good against a stone castle.  Then the attacking general has a brilliant idea: \\"Hmmm... they can see our arrows, since their on fire... maybe we shouldn't light them! Yeh! Then they'll be virtually invisible, since it's night and all!\\"  He even gives a name to this new, invincible weapon: Night Arrows!  What a brilliant strategic manuever!  His enemies don't stand a chance!  Then all his men applaud his genius as they proceed to decimate the castle with their night arrows.  I was speechless.  I've seen some great military strategy in movies, but nothing compares to this. <br /> <br />So as you can see, not the best of movies.  I suppose you could make a drinking game out of it: one person drinks everytime Paul Walker says something stupid, anotherperson drinks when something doesn't make sense, another when some retarded military idea is proposed, and then another who drinks everytime an actor says \\"whoa\\" or \\"night arrows\\".  Guarenteed you'll all be wasted by the end.

B000AARKOO|1.0|I saw this one somewhat reluctantly, expecting another epic with grand sweeping battles and great visuals (like the Iliad) but with a somewhat questionable storyline.  Truth be told, I'm kind of exhausted of epic war movies after LOTR drained me, but I saw Kingdom of Heaven anyways.  Big mistake. <br /> <br />The movie is terrible.  It stars Legolas (or whatever the hell his real name is) as some backwater blacksmith who finds out he's the bastard son of some nobleman.  After the nobleman dies, Legolas assumes his fathers place and proceeds to thrash anyone who gets in his way.  This part of the movie drove me nuts.  Observe:  the movie seems to span about a week in time.  In that short time, Legolas goes from a simple blacksmith to some kind of master warrior who is easily able to defeat trained knights on the battlefield.  Nevermind the fact that his life to this point has consisted of beating iron over a forge; this is Hollywood!  Not only is he nearly invincible, but suddenly the king of Jerusalem declares his love for him AFTER KNOWING HIM FOR 2 DAYS! Then he passes the throne to him upon his death!  What has he done to inspire this love?  Well, he sleeps with the king's sister, sets his peasants to days of digging in the dust, and loiters around Jerusalem sitting on hilltops and walking through the streets.  Wouldn't you say this qualifies him to rule probably the most famous city in history? <br /> <br />And that's not all folks, it gets even better!  After Legolas turns down the kingship (because he's such a perfect knight), he proceeds to advise the city's generals on the best way to conduct a war.  Because everyone knows that a large portion of blacksmith training involves military tactics, troop deployment, and psychology of the enemy's mind (which he seems to know intimately, despite the fact that he never met the man).  Foolishly, the veteran generals dismiss Legolas's master plan, and they are of course beaten.  So if falls to Legs to devise defense plans for Jerusalem.  He proceeds to make impassioned speeches to his troops, command the firing and placement of huge, complex catapults called trebuchets, decide where to place his archers and troops, and generally make all the tough decisions that experienced battlefield commanders are more prone to.  All of which he succeeds brilliantly at.  Of course. <br /> <br />I could go on, but I'm so furious at this point I'm going to break my keyboard.  Read some of the other negative reviews to see all about the historical innaccuracies and such.  Simply put, don't waste 2 1/2 hours on this pile of crap.
B0009VRHLK|3.0|That's the secret, because it really is quite a movie, but your mind has to be slowed down to appreciate it.  If you are in \\"normal\\" movie watching mode.......looking for excitement or intrigue or laughs, this will seem very slow and pointless.  But with a little heaviness in the eyelids, the flow of the scenes and the abstract imagery will seem quietly mesmerizing. The songs in the film are just right.  It's not a great film and not for everybody (especially those with an aversion to graphic sex), but not nearly as bad as some people have said.  I stopped paying attention to Roger Ebert's opinions a long time ago!
0060512806|5.0|Do you I have a short attention span? If your answer is yes, may not be able to get the most from this book. Furthermore, if you have no interest in cryptography, World War Two, internet culture or high finance- this will bore you to tears. I actually read the book \\"Crypto\\" by Levy to prepare for this book and was happy I did. <br /> <br />The plot is a mix between three main characters. Two are Bobby Shaftoe, corporal in the army, and Daniel Waterhouse, a cryptanalysis specialist. Their paths crisscross during WWII as they fight to mislead and out fox their Nazi counterparts. The third main character is Randall Waterhouse, the grandson of Daniel and one of the founding members of an internet bank. This bank may revolutionize the world of finance. You may be asking how these two story lines are related. Well, to start a bank you need hard currency and it just so happens that Shaftoe and D. Waterhouse uncover a plot to hide billions in Japanese and Nazi gold at the end of WWII.  <br /> <br />The story jumps back and forth as Daniel, Jack and Randall all trace a path to the hidden gold. Many other historical figures appear as characters, one of the most interesting is Alan Turing, the man credited with the invention of the modern computer. Another is the wonderful portrait of \\"the General\\", MacArthur and his interactions with Bobby Shaftoe on the island of Manila. Stephenson really knows how to bring the man to life! Various other historical figures, small and large, pop in from time to time. Any WWII or history buff will gain much enjoyment just by the noticing of passing historical references and people; this is one of the books biggest selling points.  <br /> <br />The Cryptonomicon's time line is non-linear, with each successive chapter taking place at a different location and following a different character. Therefore, if you are going to read this, know that there are many names, places and dates crucial to you getting the most out of this book.  <br /> <br />With that said, I can honestly say that, apart from about 20 pages of mathematics that I could not fully understand, this was one of the most idea filled and interesting books I've laid my hands on in some time. Stephenson may be a genius of Da'Vinci proportion, if not that, then at least a teacher of Feynman's caliber.  <br />

B00028HBKM|3.0|The Passion of the Christ is a film I doubt will ever be shown on television as an Easter Holidays Special. It interweaves high-level violence worse then you found in most horror films, the subtitling of two languages, and the brutal simplistic story of a medieval passion play. There is a single theme brought home again and again. Christ suffered for our sins.<br /><br />When Mel Gibson first planned making the film, he didn't want to use subtitles. Through most of the film, you don't need them anyway to understand what is taking place. There is a visual language in the stylised costumes, and the acting.<br /><br />Jesus Christ (James Caviezel) has a quiet distance from the world that shows without words he is the Son of God. Speaking, Caviezel detracts from this by delivering his lines with a wooden earnestness.<br /><br />The film occurs during the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus. It isn't easy to understand the story. Gibson may think his audience will have read the New Testament. Or he didn't want this story to detract from the violence, at the heart of the film.<br /><br />This violence begins when he is taken prisoner by the Jewish Temple Guards. To describe the violence he suffered here would be to detract from the graphic nature of it. Reading what happens to him, you won't be able to suspend your disbelief to believe he could have survived any of it.<br /><br />The scourging of Jesus is made worse by Gibson's attention to detail. The Romans have to work themselves up to be able to do it. The sound made by the torture instruments striking into Jesus' flesh. Even when Gibson shies away from the scourging, you can still hear it. This will probably become one of the most memorable, and horrifying, sequences in cinematic history.<br /><br />Between the scenes of Jesus' torment, we witness the other characters in the story. Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello) receives his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. But he, and his money are cursed. In scenes of graphic ugliness, he is driven to madness and suicide.<br /><br />The two Marys, Jesus' mother (Maia Morgenstern) and the former prostitute Mary Magdalene  (Monica Bellucci) are there to witness, and react to the suffering of Jesus. It is from them, we are meant to gauge how to feel about the events unfolding on the screen.<br /><br />These events are of suffering and pain. The actual crucifixion is almost a relief after the scourging. By then Jesus is a half dead, blood-splattered ruin of a man. He dies on the cross along side two common criminals. To keep the interest of his audience, here Gibson adds Hollywood touches you won't find in any bible.<br /><br />You also won't find any spirituality, or goodness here. The theme of this dark movie is the pain and suffering Jesus suffered on behalf of Christians. For them, it is a gorefest held in a good cause. It is this audience the film is intended for.In scenes of graphic ugliness, he is driven to madness and suicide. <br /> <br />The two Marys, Jesus' mother (Maia Morgenstern) and the former prostitute Mary Magdalene  (Monica Bellucci) are there to witness, and react to the suffering of Jesus.

B00003CXA4|5.0|I watched this movie years ago having not seen it since I was a kid.  After watching it I decided to write my senior research paper about him, as I wanted an excuse to not just read and absorb him, but gush about him to someone. <br /> <br />Gandhi was a great man.  What a tale it is, from being a reletively simple, unknown attorney to becoming one of the greatest world leaders in history.  His turning point moment came when he was thrown off a train for sitting in the first class car in South Africa.  He would not allow for Indians to be treated like third class citizens anymore and moved towards equality.  Not only did he achieve the smaller equalities, but he overthrew the British Empire's occupation and at long last freed India.   <br /> <br />I will spare the blow by blow of this movie, as it tells his story so well (if just glossing over just a few of his major points and good works for people).  But this movie, as well as his written work, taught me how to be a better person.  Despite how corny and silly that may sound of me, I learned not to complain.  Even the scummiest of jobs (ex. rake and cover the latrine) you do with joy.  People lash out at others when they are angry and unhappy, and yes they hurt you, but you will not be beaten down if you realize that happiness is not handed to you but earned by our own efforts.  I always remember his words in my darkest hours ... <br /> <br />\\"When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won.  There have been tyrants and murderes, for a time they can seem invincable but in the end they always fall.  Think of it.  Always.\\" <br /> <br />If that doesn't bring tears to your eyes, then nothing will.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|As Spiderman 2 slowly faded away from our cinemas, Hellboy has come to take his place with cigar chomping vengeance. While Peter Parker hid behind a mask and fought evil, Hellboy was born evil. He ground down the stubs of his horns in a futile attempt to look more or less human.<br /><br />Underneath all the make up and prosthetics Hellboy is Ron Perlman. In Blade II and Alien: Resurrection he played kick ass bad boys who did good deeds when it was in their interest. Now he is the star of the film, given a great script and enough screen time to somehow express the vulnerable side of a monster far worse then anything he has played before.<br /><br />Hellboy was born in 1944 on a barren Scottish island, which just happened to be a crossroad into a hell dimension. Lead by none other then Rasputin (Karel Roden), the Nazis try to unlock hell. Only to be stopped by Professor Broom (John Hurt), and a bunch of cigar chomping American soldiers. Hellboy is then found by Broom, who raises him to be an agent of the super secret FBI Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.<br /><br />Almost from the start of the film, this means Hellboy fights creatures, which are bigger, meaner and even more ugly then himself. He seems to relish these visually fantastic CGI (Computer Generated Image) encounters, which are shot like lovingly detailed tiles in a comic book. His giant stone right hand, super strength and intellect mean Hellboy usually ends up winning, but as you soon work out, its the battle with his destiny that is soon going to be the biggest problem the world has to face.<br /><br />Hellboy is according to Rasputin the demon whose destiny it is to bring forth the destruction of humanity. In a way Hellboy knows this, and it helps explain his self-loathing. Although even then, in his monster suit, Perlman at times shows a surprisingly sweet gentleness. His love of kittens, and especially fire starting babe Liz Sherman (Selma Blair.)<br /><br /> Like in a comic book, the other characters are only really seen in their relationships with the hero. So along with Blair, the centuries old fish man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), and new team member FBI agent Joe Myers (Rupert Evans) don't develop in their own rights.<br /><br />Del Toro has carried across the dark, articulate visual language of this comic book into his film. It works because of his attention to detail, and what this communicates to the audience. Walking out of the cinema, I felt I'd read a comic, not seen the film. I think this is the effect he wants it to have on us.the other characters are only really seen in their relationships with the hero.

B00097DXZS|2.0|Like a couple of other reviewers, I have everything that Santana has ever done, and have seen the band live a million times. <br />I hate to say this, but the album is a good cure for insomnia. Carlos, what were you thinking? <br />\\"All that I am\\" is messy, with few periods of great guitar work and a wonderful percussion section way under utilized, which has always been the basis of great Santana music in the past. <br />Performances by guest vocalists are mediocre at best. <br />Carlos, you owe it to your loyal fans to create an album with just you and your band of great musicians. Lighten up on the vocals, play more instrumental stuff, and show the World why Santana is second to none in musical ability.  <br />By the way, Caravanserai is my favourite.   <br />

Martin decided to flesh out that five year period in these two books and not just skip those years.  So to a certain extent the book is fluff to much of the plot, but it helps Martin avoid having to go in depth and explain the intervening period without lengthening book 6. <br /> <br />The second book is well over half done.  He chose to segregate the stories in the two books and had already written much of what will go in the next book.  I expect that on in a couple years, but I fear the sixth book will seem like a lifetime away.

Since Alan Wilder left the group the rhythm parts and even the catchy melodies are just GONE and now it seems never to return either. <br />This entire album is even worse than \\"exiter\\" which was their tragedy in music making. All sounds very a tonal, no melodies , nothing catchy which you at least would expect of such great songwriters. The worst is that we know they can , but simply they refuse to use their talent in any productive way. This is not a new road to take surely. I appreciate a band experimenting but this one definately is an experiment gone wrong.  <br />Of course this album will sell shiploads and see if they care, but to me this album is the Depeche Mode's (fans )emperors clothes!

0804836272|2.0|Last year, the local foreign-language TV station here in L.A. broadcast an NHK-produced, fictionalized series about the Shinsengumi. The show was gripping, but it was obvious that the whole thing was highly romanticized. Since then, I've been looking for a more historically accurate account of the period, so I was delighted when I found this book.    I did indeed learn a lot more about the Shinsengumi from it. For one thing, the television series presents the group's members as heroes and patriots. By including descriptions of less-than-flattering incidents conveniently left out of the TV version, Hillsborough's book essentially portrays the Shinsengumi as a group of deluded, self-aggrandizing thugs. My personal sense is that there's some truth to be found in both of these approaches. Being aware of television's need to simplify and anoint heroes, I tend to trust books more. In this case, however, the written word doesn't live up to its promise. Neither version presents enough evidence for its own point of view, nor does either generate enough overall credibility to allow the consumer to make anything resembling an informed judgment.    Hillsborough says in the Preface that he's \\"concentrated on the spirit of the Shinsengumi and their place in history, rather than on trivial details....\\" To my mind, that's insufficient justification for the disorganized, repetitive writing and overheated descriptions found in this volume.     Regarding organization, I'm no fan of the \\"Dates and Places\\" school of history, and I have no trouble with the idea of an author bringing an era alive by telling incidents out of their chronological order. But really, shouldn't there be some kind of reason for jumbling these things? I couldn't discern one here.    The real problem with the book, though, is the shallowness of its analysis. Hillsborough's thesis is appears twofold. First, that a \\"will to power\\" combined with \\"self-aggrandizement\\" leads to trouble. Second, that the \\"superior martial spirit, fighting technique, and an unflinching propensity to kill,\\" and the \\"official sanction to kill\\" granted by the Tokugawa shogunate is what set the Shinsengumi apart from their peers. This might be true. Repeating it over and over doesn't make it true. At one point, the phrase \\"propensity to kill\\" appears eight times in two pages. Several chapters later the point is driven home yet again, with a chapter entitled, yes, \\"A Propensity to Kill.\\"    The Shinsengumi were a tragic group of idealists trying to hold on to a world that was passing them by. Their goals were lofty; their methods were brutal. I don't believe their leaders were unaware of the tensions between their ideals and reality. Although many were peasants, they were educated and pursued art and culture along with their martial activities. I await the day when an author writing in English treats their complexities with sensitivity and justice.    [Three stars for the information. One for the writing. Average: Two.]

B000001G8A|5.0|What makes this \\"Girl frm the Gold West\\" so golden is the mastership of all the forces behind it - conductor Zubin Mehta, tenor Placido Domingo, soprano Carol Neblitt and baritone Sherill Milnes. This recording dates from the 80's, which was still a terrific period for Mehta, Domingo, Neblitt, eventhough at this time Sherill Milnes was facing some vocal decline. The 80's modern studio recording advantages is what makes this a superb interpretation. The pacing is dramatic, thrilling and lyrical when warranted. This is probably Puccini's most exotic opera. Butterfly was set in Japan but was still pretty Italian under the surface. In Butterfly, the Japanese-Italian mix was also suffused with slight Americana (the American national anthem changed to \\"America Forever\\") but here we are treated to an entirely different animal. This is the Old West and Puccini's Italian style is nearly sacrificed for what could pass for an American opera or even a Broadway musical. This does not mean that this is not an operatic treasure. The music is exquisite. The lead soprano role of Minnie is a voice-killer, and presents many challenges to the soprano. In truth, it takes a soprano capable of Turandot to sing Minnie. As far as I'm concerned, only one soprano truly nailed the role- Birgit Nilsson. On stage, her mannerisms and her voice was the very character that Puccini envisioned. Birgit Nilsson is featured in a 60's recording of this opera which captured her in her prime and her portrayal is the best there is, closest to the original soprano who premiered the role opposite Enrico Caruso back at the turn of the century - Emmy Destin. Nilsson probably possessed a bigger instrument than Destin. Still Neblitt does an excellent job with what she has in her favor -a rich Puccini voice. She may struggle with the high tessitura but she is simply ravishing in the lyrical segments. She sounds like a kind of American Tosca. More than any other tenor, Placido Domingo possessed a voice that could essay any character in any opera and I seriously mean that. He is Enrico Caruso's reincarnation and his performance as Dick Johnson is a tribute to Caruso's style. He has the dramatic heft and the voluminous beauty of tone to sing each line. It helped that Domingo looked very handsome in the 80's so that when he sang the heroic and romantic leads, he could pass for a movie star who could also sing opera. As Johnson, he looks dashing (if he looked like he does on the cover of this album). Sherill Milnes was in the final phase of his career but in this opera he holds out till the end in his usual flair. He was a fine exponent of Puccini, as his Scarpia attests, and he is nuanced and even a bit comical on this recording. Verdi baritone parts are far more challenging than the almost static Puccini baritone parts so this role presented no problem to the aging Milnes. Zubin Mehta conducts with brilliant technical mastership and delivers some subtleties as well. Thank you Deutsche Grammophone for the great music.
B00005JO17|5.0|I do not have kids, I saw the trailers of this movie and thought I wanted to see it.  The other night we were out to dinner with friends and we went out to see it with them and we laughed almost from beginning to end.<br /><br />This has to be one of the best animated movies in years.  It even starts, in a way, making fun of some of the great movies that came before.  The story is appealing to any kid, or grown up for that matter, who ever struggles not being popular or understood.  There are lessons about perserverance, friendship, hard work to overcome a handicap, powerful lessons for kids and big kids alike.  The characters are all in high school, so the dynamics of being popular and fitting in and being a success are all there.<br /><br />One of the things that got me was how quickly the time went, I laughed so much throughout the whole thing that the movie was over in minutes, seemingly.<br /><br />Unlike some of the previous releases, there are no inuendos, and the adult humor is clean stuff that only the adults would laugh at not even Bugs Bunny adult humor.  Even the music was tame, no heavy hip hop during and after the movie.  It was something anyone could take their kids to and even buy when the DVD comes out.  I am putting this on my wish list, first time for me to order a cartoon movie.  I just think it is a movie that does not have crass borderline things in it.<br /><br />Some may say that the teasing of the weak or unpopular in the movie is a negative, however, it is all with positive results with friendships being strengthened and the unpopular overcoming things and hanging together.<br /><br />I have my favorite scenes, but I do not want to spoil this for anyone, the last scene will make you laugh and laugh when they make a movie about what Chicken Little and the gang did.  The reflections and allusions in the movie are so on target.  Disney hit a home run in this movie.  A must see for young and old.  The whole family needs to see this together.s together.
B00005ONMP|5.0|I had heard all the music on here before interpreted by other conductors and other symphonies but Claudio Abbado proved to be the most efficient for me. Thanks to the world's leading classical music label- Deutsche Grammophone -we are able to hear a complete set of Mendelssohn's symphonies and overtures with the acclaimed London Symphony in a beautiful and surprisingly afforadable album. For music that is this good, I was surprised that it wasn't a little more expensive. But good, right ? Just more of Mendelssohn to love. On this album: his symphonies 1-5, Scherzo in G Minor from the Octet for Strings, the Overture to A Midsumer Night's Dream incidental music and Hebrides Overture. These are the most famous Mendelssohn creations. His Fourth Symphony is the \\"Italian\\" symphony, with lyrical, bouncy rhythms and classical harmony. The Midsummer Night's Dream overture encompasses romanticism at its peak, with sprightly strings representing the mischievous fairies that figure prominently in the Shakespeare comedy. The Hebrides Overture is evocative of wintery landscapes and sea breezes, a fine example of a tone poem and musical painting at its best. Its haunting melody is instantly recongizable. Abbado is clearly suited for this kind of music and it's refreshing to see him stray from the usual Italian repertoire he is most famous for. Still, inescapably, his Italian soul stands out but this gives this music more color, more volume and lyricism than what can often succumb to stale, cold English interpretations like Andre Previn's conducting. No offense to Mr. Previn, who has produced some brilliant music. <br />             <br />   <br />   <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Upon listening to \\"Playing the Angel\\", the new DM record, I knew I was going to like it. I like every DM album; including the ones the fans usually complain about, although I'm not much of a \\"Speak & Spell\\" fan. But I knew that I liked \\"Exciter\\", and most bands who've been around as long as DM don't even have to prove themselves by trying to break a whole lot of ground. What should be considered is if the album sounds good or not, if the lyrics are good or not, things like that. And in both accounts it is excellent. I PITY anyone who doesn't like this release. They are missing out on something that I never thought I could expect out of these guys. It has quite varied sounds in it. It can be pretty edgy at times like in \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" and \\"The Sinner in Me\\"; especially the bridge/coda of the latter. Even those songs have little lacking in melody, another standout quality of this album. <br /> <br />Dave Gahan's contributions are good too, notably \\"Suffer Well\\". While not extraordinary, it gets a five by my standards even with his other two because the surprisingly good material is what stands out. Sure, it doesn't seem like \\"Violator\\" now, and isn't as immediate. But once you've been blown away, the same can never happen with you immediately again. <br /> <br />Oh, and comparing it to U2 in recent years is just ludicrous. Everything from \\"Songs\\" to here blows what U2 have done since \\"Pop\\" out of the water. Very little about \\"Playing the Angel\\" even seems forced to me. I'm kind of superficial about high-tech sound, and so I really tend to like this album. Where the production was more of the strength with \\"Exciter\\", it's in the songwriting in this one. \\"Damaged People\\" additionally is beautiful.
0689878451|5.0|This true story is an excellent way to teach children that families are of all varieties. By portraying \\"family\\" as those who care for and love one another, this book expresses the most important aspects of a true family. I'm sharing this book with everyone I know!
0790742780|2.0|Joel Schumacher could've had a killer movie: a feature-length newspaper headline reading \\"Angry White Male Cuts Swath of Destruction Across L.A.\\"  It couldah been a contendah.  And besides, how can you go wrong with Douglas and Duvall?<br /><br />But it does go wrong.  First, we get recycled ethnic characters from every possible ethnic group (AWMs included in Douglas himself, wearing 60s knock-off classes, a white shirt and a pocket protector for heaven's sake).  Even then, the movie could have been great in a schlocky kind of way, a fantasy revenge flick for AWMs.  But then Schumacher totally blows the other parts of the story, particularly Duvall's Detective Prendergast as a recycled detective-on-the-verge-of-retirement, a cliche so common that it's been repeatedly lampooned in movies like \\"Short Time\\" and cartoons like \\"The Simpsons\\":  \\"No! NO!  MENDDDOOOOZAAA!\\"<br /><br />In short: great principle story and actors ruined by tired supporting characters and secondary plot.

The color photos are beautiful, and it is always nice to see what the finished product \\"should\\" look like.  And with such detailed directions, your end product will most assuredly match the pictures.  Martha has done it again.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot is the best metal ever to hit the earth!! I am a die hard maggot and i love every album they have ever come out with. The Namless is my personal favorite because, it is the perfect blend of screaming, talking and great guitar lines. As for \\"As I lay Dying\\". Screw them. The pail in comparison to Slipknot. Slipknot is the best metal band ever and always will be.

B0007GAEW6|4.0|I'm a fan of prog-rock, but the Mars Volta are the weirdest band I've ever heard.  It probably has a lot to do with the fact that the reference points are even more obscure.  I'm not sure these guys have even heard of Rush, for example.  I don't like \\"The Widow\\" very much, but all 4 of the other songs (the last 8 tracks are the last song, \\"Cassandra Geminni,\\" stupidly cut up by Evil Record Execs) have moments of piercing brilliance. <br /> <br />I'm tempted to call the style \\"maximumism\\".. Where the Pixies keep instrumentation simple and songs to a 3-minute maximum, the Mars Volta drag the last song out to over half an hour and when the songs really get going it sounds like there might be 20 or 30 different instruments/sound effects going on.  The vocals always have bizarre effects on, a thousand backing tracks, and they slide around from one speaker to the other. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, these hard-rocking, intense, cramped segments fade way too often into endless ambient sections.  For example, \\"Miranda\\" opens with like 5 minutes of coqui frogs and other strange noises.  It's a great song once it actually starts, but this is a rock album, not a \\"sounds of the forest\\" relaxation tape; something has to HAPPEN!  \\"Cassandra\\" is particularly marred by this trait; I enjoy the end immensely, but to get there I have to sit through endless amounts of random noise and ambient jazz horns (probably played by Flea). <br /> <br />Overall, 4 stars for originality, scattershot brilliance, beautiful production, and boundless creativity.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I own almost every album of Santana, a life long fan. I own LP's, Pre recorded cassettes, CDs and DVDs. This is one ablum I WILL NOT BUY with DRM software. Santana why are you doing this to your loyal fans ? We know money is not important to you, so why this ?
B00004Y6NV|3.0|By no means a bad album, but a bit disappointing in places.  The best known selections are excellent but there seems to be a lot of 'filler' here unlike other Dire Straits albums in the form of too much background music, and MK's sharp storytelling seems to lost its edge (in songs like 'My Parties).  In 'On Every Street' the group at times just sounds as if they had had enough.  However the strongest songs - including the opener 'Calling Elvis', the title track, 'The Bug' and 'Heavy Fuel' are still enjoyable to listen to which is what counts in the end.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This is just mind blowing. This is art to the finest degree. I got this album recently after deciding to venture into the serenity of the best death metal group I have ever heard (and truth be told, the only death metal group I can stand to listen to). <br /> <br />Listening to this album was mind blowing. I loved every single second of it. Somehow Opeth manages to fit crazy riffs and solos in this amazing album. What really did it for me though, was the DVD. Lamentations makes this album 50,000 times better than what it already was. If you don't have this DVD, get it now. Opeth are one of the best live bands ever, and they make this album come to life. <br /> <br />I have hated death metal my whole life, I am a very devout progressive metal fan and crazy guitars impress me a lot more than angry vocals. Opeth is the one exception to the rule. They are simply amazing. Get this album now.
B0009A21R6|5.0|I still love this CD and ever since it came out 20 years ago has been a permanent fixture in my collection.  So the anniversary edition was the way to go upon its release (along with the new DS/MK compilation 'Private Investigations'.  This is still a classic and the best of their studio albums, along with 'Love Over Gold'.
630438551X|5.0|I am a big R&J fan. <br /> <br />The version with Clair and Leo is my very favorite. why? it nicely contemporises everything in the world of verona italy, making the characters seem more real and understanding than ever before. <br /> <br />Leo and Clair's chemistry is to die for as the pair cuddle in bed the morning after their wedding night . ..  <br /> <br />\\"Then let me be taken! let me be put to death! i have more care to stay than will to go! come death and welcome! juliet wills it so!\\" <br /> <br />and when romeo and juliet meet for the first time at the party, they see each other through the opposite sides of a fish tank and the flirting is heart melting. <br /> <br />\\"Did my heart love til now?\\" romeo whispers to himself as he watches juliet dance reluctantly with her future fiancee. <br /> <br />Mercutio gives an outstanding performance and is the most memorable mercutio yet. he brings the character to life and is more real and vibrant almost than anyother charcter in the play. in other words, he steals the spotlight and runs with it. <br /> <br />if you won't buy this movie, you'll want to after you rent it. it's a tale that will leave goosepimples up the backs of your arms as bodies are carted away and the prince bellows at who he feels are the culprits. <br /> <br />\\"All! Are! Punished!\\"
B00000DGUY|2.0|Firstly in response to the editorial - 'Communique' is not a dismal record by any means!  It may not have fared as well as other DS albums and had no hits so to speak, but it was a good album! <br />Its a shame that instead of releasing a 2 CD compilation, instead cramming 16 songs onto one CD meant editing so many great songs - 'Money for Nothing', 'Brothers In Arms', et al.  More over, this collection has too many annoying live renditions of songs which were superior in their original studio format - 'Love Over Gold' in particular.  With the new 'Private Investigations' CD out now (in single and also  double CD form), check that one out, or stick to the original studio albums, this is not a showcase of DS at their best.  Several tracks including the superb 'Telegraph Road' areis also missing from this collection.
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca is my favorite book.<br /><br />I read it about . . . oh, maybe five months ago, but the characters are still fresh in my mind. Why? Because I can relate so easily to the nameless young woman who narrates the tale.<br /><br />Our namesless shero is shy, meek, and bites her tongue a little too often. She works for a fat, gossipy woman who, ironically enough, unwittingly brings her into contact with her future husband -- Maxim de Winter.<br /><br />Maxim is a man haunted by a greivious burden...<br /><br />\\"They say he can't get over his wife's death . . .\\"<br /><br />But max's secret isn't what it seems.

A shaken Max went down to identify her and has lived a reclusive life ever since . . . . until the day he meets and falls in love with our nameless shero.<br /><br />Miss. Nameless is happy with Maxim, but the longer she lives at the castle-like Manderly, the more clues she finds . . . unraveling a mystery that will glue the reader to his or her book.<br /><br />Just how exactly DID rebecca really die?

B000002KYB|5.0|This is one of the best (if not the best) of Dire Straits' back catalogue.  Interestingly, the new DS/MK compilation, 'Private Investigations', features the 3 best-known tracks from this album.  The title track has never sounded better than on here, in its original studio format.  'Telegraph Road' is an epic masterpiece, 'Private Investigations' is dark, and the other two songs, the satirical 'Industrial Disease' and 'It Never Rains' are excellent as well.  Mark Knopfler's lyrics are excellent and the storytelling prevails throughout.  Drummer Pick Withers is on top form.  Don't be put off by the fact that there's only the 5 songs here - the album lasts for over 41 minutes, and the guitar work - both electric and acoustic - is superb throughout. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Writer/director Joss Whedon had a daunting task ahead of him when making \\"Serenity\\". He had to appeal to a hearty fan following, and bring in people who were new to the product. Did he succeed? We'll see when the box office numbers star rolling in. But here is my assessment.<br /><br />From the fan side of things, not only are you battling their desire to see more of their beloved \\"Firefly.\\" But you are also at odds with the anticipation of the new episode. Anticipation can kill a movie before it gets started. How do you live up to three years of desire? On this, I was initially worried. The first scenes are a little slow moving, though important from an exposition standpoint. Ultimately though, from the fan perspective, I believe the movie is a roaring success. Even though some of the primary cast get little more than a scene or two.<br /><br />Captain Malcolm Reynolds - Mal is a much darker version of the character from the series. Rarely do we see the mischief. That gleam in his eyes. This time out, he's deadly serious. Credit Whedon and Nathan Fillion for taking that kind of a chance with their leading man.<br /><br />Wash - One of the great elements of the series was the occasional Wash wisecrack. Even if it was in Chinese. Alan Tudyk is given a couple of moments, but nothing memorable.<br /><br />Zoe - Aside from the usual, Zoe doesn't get a lot of play here either. Her one big moment comes off more like her one big half-moment.<br /><br />Kaylee - Curiously, our little Kaylee has taken to verbally slapping Mal around. Obviously less meek than in the series, she keeps turning the knife in his back in a way that was formally in playful jest.<br /><br />Jayne - The big, out for himself, lug has some fun lines. Almost all of which have been in the trailers. And he seems uncharacteristically heroic in the action scenes. Protecting others before worrying about himself. The rest of the time, he's Jayne.<br /><br />Simon Tam - The good doc gets more to do than some of his shipmates. He also seems to be the same person we knew from the series. Focused on helping his sister recover from what the government did to her.<br /><br />River Tam - Second only to Mal, this is her movie. Summer Glau acquits herself fairly well in the action sequences. She's a dancer, and Whedon took full advantage of that with the fight choreography.<br /><br />Inara - Morena Baccarin looks great on screen. No doubt about it. For the life of me, I can't remember if she actually has any lines in this movie.<br /><br />Shepherd Book - Gets a couple of nice little scenes with Mal. Not much else.<br /><br />Apparently, a number of scenes were shot which would appeal more to the fan base. But Whedon excised them in favor of making the film less in-joke and more accessible. While they may end up on the DVD, he's vowed against a \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film. Maybe we won't have to suffer the endless \\"Really, Really Special Edition\\" DVDs here.<br /><br />Trying to forget what I know about the show, I think the movie will play alright for the uninitiated. While there have been a few shortcuts taken (i.e. - Why Inara left Serenity.) The vast majority of the film plays out very well. If people let go of the \\"failed TV series\\" thing, they should have a good two hours.ore to do than some of his shipmates. He also seems to be the same person we knew from the series.

B00004Y6NX|4.0|This is almost a classic with two drawbacks - short duration (38 mins), and an awful closing track 'Les Boys', one of the few dud tunes that Mark Knopfler ever wrote.  Otherwise this is an absolutely fine album.  Side one of the original vinyl (ie. 'Tunnel of Love', 'Romeo and Juliet', 'Skateaway'), is superb and faultless all the way.  In terms of a comparison with 'Love Over Gold', the latter is definitely better.
B000B9EY2U|4.0|My wife and I are pretty big fans of DM; so of course, once this came out, we had to get ourselves a copy.  We've had it for a little while now, and here's our take on it. <br /> <br />The first single, Precious, is a great DM track - and the first half of the album is really easy to listen to, and very accessible.  There's a slightly more industrial sound to some parts of it - a little grating in places, actually - but it's still very clearly Depeche Mode. <br /> <br />The second half of the album is a little harder to get into; few of the songs have the immediate bite of the first half.  The only song I flat out don't like is Damaged People; that one just seems to grate on me.  The rest are an odd mix; some definitely grow on you, though. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this is a decent album by Depeche Mode, but not their best offering.  I would put Ultra, Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion ahead of it, I think; and I don't think the album will convert many people who aren't already fans.  For existing DM fans, it's a mix - some will be delighted by it, and some will be disappointed.  For the rest of us, I imagine it'll be somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br />The one thing that's a little disappointing here, though, is the attached DVD.  We picked it up mostly to have the Dolby Surround version of the album (with a view to actually owning a surround-sound system at some point), but the rest of the DVD is very limited - the video of Precious is good, and the brief Making Of featurette is interesting, but all that's left after that is a video of a recording of Clean - quite nice - and a disappointingly short slideshow.  I can't help but think they could have made this part of the special-edition package much richer than it ended up being.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|This second album from Dire Straits is excellent - and quickly grows on you.  Sure, there are none of the classic tracks that we all grew to know and love, and also provoked inferior comparison with the group's debut (which is as good an album).  The 9 selections here are totally listenable, top quality songs with no duds worth skipping and MK's storytelling lyrics prevail throughout.  It has a very laidback feel to it like the first album does, but also a 'summery' tropical feel, possibly due to its recording location. <br /> <br />'Lady Writer' was probably the candidate for a single if there ever was one.  Other tracks worthy of mention include the opener 'Once Upon A Time in the West', 'Portobello Belle', 'Single Handed Sailor' and the superb closing brooder 'Follow Me Home'.
0763617105|5.0|My two-year-old daughter loves this book. Her preschool recommended it, and when I first saw it, I thought she might be frightened by it.  Not the case.  She loves reading it at night before bed, and she talks about it during the day.  It teaches a great concept:  Mommy comes back.  It's and easy read with repetition (which kids love), and the illustrations are different than most children's books.  She loves looking at the \\"owl babies\\" and especially loves the drawings of the Mother Owl.  I highly recommend this book for your toddler and/or preschooler!
B000005JA8|5.0|I can see how this album is hated by many but if you can get past the grating first time through it, the reward is beyond your wildest imagination.

B000002N2P|5.0|Finally, after all these years, Green Day has really hit it big. They've been together for over 16 years, and their music is finally being appreciated. What amazes me the most is that artists with hardly any talent *cough cough Justin Timberlake and Hilary Duff* can easily recieve constant airplay, yet unbelievable bands like Green Day, who have been together since before Hilary Duff was even born, have to work hard for decades to hit the mainstream. (Not that that's been their goal...I'm just saying that pop artists have basically taken over the airwaves.) The band is incredibly talented- Billie Joe Armstrong is probably among the best guitarists of modern rock, and has a voice that is pretty much the eupiteme of punk rock. Mike Dirnt is flawless on the bass guitar (and, I just noticed this by listening to the backup vocals on several of their CD's, but Mike Dirnt's voice isn't too bad...he adds a lot to the vocals in their songs) and Tre's drumming skills are incomparable. Listening to their albums, it's hard to believe that all that music is coming from only 3 people.  <br /> <br />Insomniac is underrated. VERY underrated and VERY underappreciated. Although not as anticipated as Dookie, it is still a great record, probably the most \\"punk\\" CD they've ever produced. At the time that this record was made, Green Day had started to move away from songs about love, girls, and the things that confused teenagers usually go through, and entered a world of anxiety and dysfunction.  The lyrics are very poignant and original- step into the mind of a hypocrite in \\"Walking Contradiction\\", the shoes of a drug dealer in \\"Tight Wad Hill\\", and the body of a boy with no self-esteem in \\"No Pride.\\" The sound is very eclectic, and, unlike some of their other albums, the bass is very prominant- especially in \\"Stuart and The Ave.\\", \\"Brat\\", \\"86\\", and \\"Panic Song,\\" which has amazing instrumentals.  <br /> <br />For what it's worth, here are some of the \\"standout tracks\\": <br /> <br />-Armatage Shanks <br />-Stuck With Me <br />-Brain Stew <br />-Jaded  <br />-Walking Contradiction <br />-No Pride <br />-Panic Song <br />-Geek Stink Breath <br />-Westbound Sign <br /> <br />(Of course, all of the songs are good.) <br /> <br />Another thing I liked about Insomniac was the artwork. To a passerby, the booklet may look like ordinary liner notes, but open it up and you have a spread of colorful, random artwork, which you could probably spend hours staring at. Flip the page over and you've got, of course, the lyrics to the song- a little hard to read at first, but who cares? <br /> <br /> <br />The only turnoff of the album was that it was short- just over half an hour long. However, the fast-paced, head-banging songs make it all worthwhile. Green Day is one of the greatest bands ever, and I think the only thing that's keeping them from a place in the Rock 'n Roll Hall of fame is time. (A lot of their instruments and outfits they've worn at concerts are at the museum, however...thankfully, not in the \\"On The Charts\\" section.) Who knows, maybe they'll be one of the inductees of 2006...

B00006AW2G|5.0|I am not a Stones fan but I am definitely on a Rolling Stones tear.  My daughter gave me Exile on Mainstreet for my birthday. Incredible.  So then I started reading about this series of four masterpieces Beggar's Banquet - Let it Bleed - Sticky Fingers - Exile on Main Street.  The SACD sound on these ABCKO (of which this is one) disks make them worth every penny - and you DO NOT even need an SACD player to hear the difference!<br /><br />Let it Bleed opens with the intense, driving social statement Gimme Shelter.  You can hear Merry (that is the correct spelling) Clayton's voice break just a little on her third \\"Rape, Murder!...\\" and Jagger in the background responds enthusiastically to her incredibly powerful vocal. I think those 4 lines of Merry singing is one of the great moments in the recorded history of rock.  Gives me the shivers everytime I hear it.<br /><br />After the incredible Gimme Shelter, the Stones move on to a gentle take on Robert Johnson's Love in Vain.  A beautiful little blues ballad.<br /><br />All of the tracks sound superb, you can hear every nuance.  Country Honk is a hoot of a piss-take on their Honky Tonk Woman single and it is wonderful. The first time I played it I was in my car. I kept looking around to see who was blowing their car horn at me! It took me a few minutes to realize it was the darn CD! *Honk-Honk*<br /><br />You Can't Always Get What You Want has never sounded better, the listener is surrounded by the sound of the Bach Choral Singers.  You could be standing right up there on the risers with the rest of the choir, the sound is that good.<br /><br />Keith Richards vocals on You Got the Silver is a nice little surprise - the guy can... or maybe it's could... actually sing.  He actually sounds a bit like (don't laugh) Sonny Bono!<br /><br />I would still have to say that, of the quartet of Stones masterworks, Exile on Mainstreet is my very favorite followed by Beggar's Banquet, Let it Bleed, and then Sticky Fingers.  All are fantastic but if I had to choose them in order, then that's how I would rate them.  Given a choice of only one I would really struggle between choosing either Exile and Beggar's.<br /><br />I believe the smart way to go would be to buy them in order, saving the very best (Exile on Main Street) for last.<br /><br />One reviewer has complained he does not like the mini-lp digi-pak packaging on the ABKCO Stones releases.  I love it.  Contrary to his assertion, the plastic spindle does not break because it has a much improved design over the traditional CD spindle you find in a jewel case.  And you get the nice picture disc.  This is as close to your old Lps as you are going to get.<br /><br />A word of warning on the used disks.  Make sure they are the 2002 remaster before wasting your money.  I once purchased a used King Crimson CD advertised along with the remasters.  It was a 20 year old remaster that really sucked.then that's how I would rate them.  Given a choice of only one I would really struggle between choosing either Exile and Beggar's.    I believe the smart way to go would be to buy them in order, saving the very best (Exile on Main Street) for last.    One reviewer has complained he does not like the mini-lp digi-pak packaging on the ABKCO Stones releases.  I love it.  Contrary to his assertion, the plastic spindle does not break because it has a much improved design over the traditional CD spindle you find in a jewel case.  And you get the nice picture disc.  This is as close to your old Lps as you are going to get.    A word of warning on the used disks.  Make sure they are the 2002 remaster before wasting your money.  I once purchased a used King Crimson CD advertised along with the remasters.  It was a 20 year old remaster that really sucked.

B000005J08|5.0|There really isn't much you can say but totally unpredictable and absolutely ingenius from start to finish. One of those rare records that keeps you on the edge of your seat and you find yourself saying about every other minute \\"How the hell did he think of that?\\". The ideas are bountiful and over the top brilliant. Every record collection should have at least one copy of Can Tago Mago, Captain Beefheart Trout Mask Replica and Naked City by John Zorn. Amazing stuff.
B000002A33|5.0|screaming trees dust a great cover and an title to get you too think and it sure does you look at the cover and wonder what the music on the cd going to be like, is it gonna repeat what they've done before? or is there gonna be a big surprise well really you know which way screaming trees make music heartfelt lyrics blistering music with a hint of that dirty word which i don't think kurt made i think soundgarden and mark lanegan made what grunge was really about...  <br />this album features such classics in my opipion  <br />holo of ashes, all i know, look at you,  <br />witness, traveller and gospel plow,  <br />this album was released long time after the grunge icon killed himself.. and around this time we had this terrible thing called britpop bought on by them god damn awful bands oasis and blur this was a saving grace that saved the last 4 years of the nineties for me...grunge is dead but the trees still grow
0679731725|5.0|Highly unusual book - somewhere between \\"Upstairs-Downstairs\\" and \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\".  Not quite tragic, but somewhat sad, about a butler's obsessive quest for perfection serving a master whose political choices before World War II were less than wise.  Steven's entire life had been spent in the service of Lord Darlington whose good name was eventually ruined forever through an unsuccessful libel suit.  He had indeed consorted with the Germans - who used him attrociously.  The title refers to what's left of Stevens' life.  He has spent too much time looking back; he must look forward.  He has judged his own life by the actions of Lord Darlington.  Incredible tone of a superior English butler kept throughout.  Reminds me somewhat of Henry James, in long sentences and rambling prose. I loved this book deeply.  Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson star in the movie.  The author displays marvelous sublety in allowing us to read between the lines - so much unsaid.

B000BBOUU4|5.0|I know that many people had complaints with this film because it wasn't the Gene Wilder Wonka from their childhood, but this is the true version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton's vision is the closest thing Hollywood could possibly ever produce to Roald Dahl's fantastical world of a remarkably clever (albeit eccentricly crazy) very sweet man.   <br /> <br />Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka.  He's actually beyond perfect.  Depp is the character actor of all character actors and his portrayal of Wonka is so hilariously crazy that it is just perfect.  The thing I find so remarkable about Depp's performance in this film is that it is his fourth starring role in a Tim Burton movie, and yet it is amazingly different from every other performance he has ever done.  So many other actor/director combinations get stagnant and appear to repeatedly do the same thing over and over (Tom Hanks/Spielberg, Tom Cruise/Spielberg, Ben Affleck/Kevin Smith, etc...) but Depp and Burton bring a new character, a new scenery, and an entirely new production to everything they work on together.  \\"Charlie\\" is no exception.   <br /> <br />And speaking of Charlie, his portrayal in this film by Freddie Highmore is awesome.  I have to admit to being slightly disappointed by the casting of Highmore as Charlie because I was not overly impressed with his performance in \\"Finding Neverland\\" but he silenced my criticism by perfectly portraying Charlie Bucket.  He was awesome.  Depp was awesome.  Burton's direction and crazy Burton-esque set design was priceless.  This movie was tremenedously crazy fun and I cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard at the movies.  \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" rocks!

0140288503|1.0|BlackHawk Down was a great book. The reason i thInk this is because it was writen in a way that it put you in the action, it made me feel like i was there in the middle of a war.  <br />   Another reason i liked this book is because it went almost exactly with the movie, and when i read a book i like to be able to watch the movie and there not be a big difference between it and the book. Also not only did the events follow along with each-other there were alot of the same words and the book used alot of detail in sense that it used the abbreviations the army does, it used the same weapons, and the same names of the people who were actually in the war. I highly recommend this book to anyone. <br />            <br />RYAN CARNEY <br />
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash broke all boundaries on this one. There early punk sound has been hidden beneath a load of other genres that were expertly mixed together on this album. From a punk fans persepective, this first was a dissapointment. Wheres \\"White Riot\\", or \\"all the young punks\\". this album was very diffrent.  <br />London Calling-an absolute classic, the punkest song on the cd.10/10 <br />Brand New Caddilac- weird song, kinda rockabilly, whatever it is, it rocks 8.5/10 <br />Jimmy Jazz-A favorite of mine, as the title suggests, it has a jazzy feel to it 9/10 <br />Hateful-An amazing song, not sure how to classify it, listen to it and youll love it though. 9/10 <br />Rudie Cant Fail-Another classic, great song. I love the chorus 9/10 <br />spanish bombs-kinda poppy, but still a really good song 8.5/10 <br />the right profile-love it, damn these songs are so good 9/10 <br />Lost in the supermarket- One of my favs, great lyrics. Really weird, but great 9.5/10 <br />Clampdown-fun song, not much more i can say 9/10 <br />Guns of Brixton-My favorite from the album. It a great reggae tune, responsible for making rancid what they are today. 10/10 <br />wrong em boyo-great song, the begging sounds like rudie cant fail 9/10 <br /> <br />okay so i would rate the rest, but im to lazy, so just know that they kick ass, and get this album. now
0002171856|5.0|Most everyone I know involved in Wilderness Survival has this book. I reference it many times and have read it cover to cover several times. I always seem to find something new. This book is easy to use as a reference and has more than adequate detail for beginners to advanced practitioners. Loaded with illustrations and pictures. Definitely a must have in your library!
B000AL730O|3.0|This album is very, very good. If you are a Paul McCartney fan, you'll love it. <br /> <br />A lot of people have been comparing it to his first album, McCartney, but it is wholly different. The only similarity is that he plays most of the instruments by himself. Personally, I prefer McCartney over Chaos and Creation in the Backyard. <br /> <br />That being said, this is a very real and a very heartfelt album. It doesn't \\"rock\\" in the sense that a classic rock album might. It isn't quite \\"easy listening,\\" either. So what genre should it be in? Why, \\"Paul McCartney,\\" of course. You cannot put a label on this man. <br /> <br />Check out Jenny Wren, Follow Me, and Riding to Vanity Fair. Fine Line, the first single, was a weak front to this album, in my opinion. Please don't judge the album after hearing it on the radio.
B00005JKC3|3.0|Lou decided to town down his massive body so that people would be more likely to see him as a person and not just as his \\"monster\\" alter ego \\"The Hulk\\". When I noticed his height, I thought \\"Damn it !!!\\", he should be over 2m. He is only 1m 96 tall and that makes me very angry. The reason, why I gave this movie only three stars is, because the story is a little bit boring. I enjoyed seeing that Hulk-monster, but the end of this film is forgetable. I think, that Louis Ferrigno is a great Bodybuilder, better than that Arnold Schwarzenegger. I enjoy watching films of Big Loui.
B000002UC5|4.0|Paul McCartney's first solo work is also, in my opinion, his best. <br /> <br />Many people rag on McCartney for his solo efforts which, after \\"McCartney II\\" and others, is understandable. However, the heartfelt emotion on this album is simply amazing. The stripped down songs are quite reminiscent of Let It Be. <br /> <br />If you're a Beatles fan, especially of their later works, check out McCartney. <br /> <br />Listen to: Every Night, Man We Was Lonely, Maybe I'm Amazed
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a great album, listen to this. <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends <br />are the best songs on this. Green Day ROCKS!!!!!!!
0307276902|5.0|And I am so glad Oprah selected it as her book choice so everyone gets a chance to meet James Frey.  This man stole my heart right away.  I hope everyone takes the time to read his follow up My Friend Leonard so you can see what becomes of his life.   <br /> <br />AMLP was not an easy book to read, Like MFL people might complain about the writing style, but to me it was like picking up someones journal and reading something so true and honest.  It is like he just blurted out his words onto a page.  I loved it.   <br /> <br />It was raw honesty, and that it takes a lot of courage to write like that.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Last night, I was driving my friend's car, while he was in the passengers seat flipping through CDs - he pulled out Damien Rice, saying \\"you have to hear this, he's the best.\\" Words can't describe how I felt, when the music started...it is hauntingly beautiful, one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. Ever. I'm so glad we had a long drive ahead of us, because I was able to hear the entire album - afterwards I knew I needed to have it (I would have bought it from Amazon but I needed it as soon as possible) so I ran out to a local music store this morning, 5 minutes after they opened, and I bought this CD. Damien Rice is a musical genius. I hope he tours in the US sometime soon.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|Ok people, listen up.  This will only take a second.  Get on with your boring life.  These naysayers are pathetically pathetic!  It was a cheap little action movie filmed in the late 70's that's entertaining for what it's supposed to be.   <br /> <br />That said, the new \\"director's\\" cut is a bunch of noise about nothing.  Do I like the comic book fade-in?  No, I think they're weak, but it doesn't really detract from the movie viewing experience.  Hey people, we're not taking Ben-Hur here, it's the friggin Warriors!  Get over it.  Take it as it is and get on with your life.  Jeez!
B000A6T1JU|1.0|As a fan of the original, I was deeply disappointed with the tinkering that was done to this classic. All the additions they added, diluted the whole tense feel of the movie. It made it really cheesy. <br /> <br />Plus, as some have pointed out, they didn't even show the (deleted)   <br />daytime Coney Island begining scene. Which was something I saw years ago and always remembered; and hoped to see again.  <br /> <br />Buy the original version if you can find it. This version is not worth spending your money on.
037571457X|4.0|Marjane Satrapi, Persepolis (Pantheon, 2003)<br /><br />Persepolis is that rarest of birds, a graphic novel that has transcended the idea of the graphic novel and gained a strong foothold in the world of mainstream literature; not since Maus has a book with so much of its content devoted to illustration gotten such a huge following among those who'd never otherwise consider looking at a \\"comic book.\\" Tack on any hopes that spring immediately to mind here; you're likely to have them dashed, just like we did with Maus. But still, maybe a handful will go on to discover David B. or Kyle Baker or Neil Gaiman's graphic work, and it will all have meant something.<br /><br />Persepolis is the first piece of Marjane Satrapi's autobiography, and it deals with her childhood and youth first in the Shah's regime, then after the overthrow by Ayatollah Khomeini (though, oddly, Khomeini is never mentioned by name once in the book; I hesitate to offer, while hoping it's true, that perhaps Satrapi keeps him unnamed as a show of disdain). Her stated goal is to show the world that many Muslims living under oppressive regimes are not tower-bombing fanatics, a stance that does raise more questions than it answers (most importantly, why share a religion with such nutcases?, a question that should not, of course, be limited only to those who follow Islam). That aside, Satrapi does achieve her goal quite handily, and it may well be an eye-opener for those who did not previously realize that not everyone in Iran is, in fact, a dangerous zealot.<br /><br />The artwork, not surprisingly, has that sort of L'Association feel about it that was also present in David B's award-winning Epileptic; everyone seems a bit rounder than one normally finds in comics, without many angles at all, seeming somewhat vague and unformed. The dialogue is subtly geared towards what a child/youth would hear, while the infrequent narration is imparted in an adult tone, giving the book a nice added touch of veracity. A very good start to the series. *** ½ity. A very good start to the series. *** 
B000BGR0OM|4.0|Because Eurythmics already have a single disc collection out, I'd expect this one to be a double, but hey, it's still an improvement, and remastered. This is 5 tracks longer than the 1991 \\"Greatest Hits\\", and basically just includes those songs and what came out since. All the obvious cuts are here, like \\"Here Comes The Rain Again\\", \\"Would I Lie To You?\\", \\"Missionary Man\\", and of course \\"Sweet Dreams (are made of this)\\". Also favorites of mine like \\"Love Is A Stranger\\", \\"Thorn In My Side\\", and \\"There Must Be An Angel (playing with my heart)\\". Plus a couple from \\"Peace\\", and two new songs. Overall, I guess this is the \\"Ultimate Collection\\".
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I have to admit that am guilty of judging this book by its cover. I heard the name, made a funny face and never gave it a chance.<br /><br />Fast forward a month or two to the middle of this fall semester and my roommate is playing these really catchy tunes that sound like a car crash between Fall Out Boy and The Newsies.<br /><br />\\"Who is that?\\"<br /><br />\\"Panic at the disco.\\" and I blush in embarassment. Look what I have missed!<br /><br />Now, there are a few things you must know about Panic! before you go constructing an opinion about them. The whole disco thing is part of the intention. I read an interview on their website where they said time and again that they were trying to make rock music that you can dance to. Good job guys. Another interesting little fact I picked up by reading some other reviews here is that their songs borrow lines from Mr. Chuck Palahniuk himself. I knew I heard that line somewhere before . . . (for example, the first song, \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide in Press Coverage is straight out of Fight Club.) These guys are ridiculously catchy, and sound a hell of a lot like Fall Out Boy, but are not musical clones that tend to pop up in the image of successful bands. If you like these guys, and haven't heard FOB, check them out. You'll also like The Academy Is . . ., who I missed in concert and regret the decision to see The Offspring instead to this day.<br /><br />My favorites on the album, if you don't feel like fishing through my ratings, are the first song and the last five songs (but all the rest is good stuff too as well). Here's a rundown of it.<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />1. The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage - I wish it was an emo trend to make really short, precise titles. Saves typing time. Despite the mouthful of a title, this is a great song. The leader singer has a great voice, and plays with vocals like a twelve year old on a pogo stick - up, down, and every other way possible. The techno-ish breakdown near the end of the song is pretty neat, and the main chorus is something anyone can rock out to. 10/10<br /><br />2. London Beckons Songs About Money Written by Machines - Not exactly my favorite on the album, but it has the image of a good song. This song has my favorite lyrics of the album in it \\"Just for the record, The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of: A. Indifference or B. Disinterest in what the critics say.\\" 9/10<br /><br />3. Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks - The techno-ish beginning is interesting (takes me way back to the days of Eiffel 65) and it revisits the funky little synthesizer bit throughout the song. Not quite as catchy as the others. 8/10<br /><br />4. Camisado - I like the beginning, it's pretty spiffy. This ones a little more fun than the last, but still not as good as what is to come. 9/10<br /><br />5. Time to Dance - I think this is the one they are advertising (at least on Purevolume they are, I don't listen to the radio). It definitely picks up the beat a little more from the last one, and gains a little more of an edge. 9/10<br /><br />6. Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off - This is a good song. It has a catchy chorus with some wicked shifts in the beat of the song. Keeps you on your toes and has little haunting verses before launching into the chorus, \\"Let's get these two hearts beating faster, faster!\\" 9/10<br /><br />Intermission<br /><br />7. But It's Better When We Do - This is a really catchy song that plays off of some jazzy piano and instrumental pauses. A real shady tone. It is connected to the next song at the end. 9/10<br /><br />8. I Write Sins Not Tragedies - My favorite song off the album, and the beginning is brilliant. Listen to it closely the first time you hear it and you'll laugh. The main chorus is easily the catchiest thing on the album (meaning it'll be stuck in your head for the rest of the day). The whole distortion part is a little iffy, but it doesn't ruin the song. This one, more than anything  reminds me of The Newsies (if you don't know what it is, you're on Amazon, for godsake, look it up) 10/10<br /><br />9. I Constantly Thank God for Esteban - Strike up the band! Nice little song with pretty little lyrics. 9/10<br /><br />10. There's a Good Reason Why These Tables Are Numbered, Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of It Yet - Holy emo title, Batman. Catchy, old style song with not a whole lot of rockin out in it, but you will definitely find yourself tapping your toes with the swingy tune. \\"I'm the new cancer, never looked better and you can't stand it.\\" Ska influence? Maybe. No matter what it's good. 10/10<br /><br />11. Build God, Then We'll Talk - Ah, more Palahniuk fun. There's a return to rock in this song, but keeps the creepy swing backdrop. The song, like a lot before it, let the singer play with his voice. 10/10<br /><br />So, go buy it. Or pay a friend for it. Or purchase it off the internet. Whatever, don't tell us how you get it. We probably don't want to know. Bottom line is that you should go get it. If you're concerned about the title of \\"emo\\" music, then just forget the whole concept and just listen to the tunes. A song is a song.<br /><br />What a wonderful caricature of intimacy.song.

B000001F3C|4.0|I often try to pick a favorite U2 album, and always end up in an 11-way tie. I think \\"War\\" is what most would consider to be the end of their early/punk period, and arguably the best of the first three albums. \\"War\\" is also the album that first caught the ear of many people, including hits such as \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\". However what makes the album completely shine for me are songs like \\"Seconds\\", \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\", and the great \\"Surrender\\". We also get the incredible closer \\"40\\", which sounds even better on the live \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" album, or of course in person. Overall I find this as essential as any of their other discs, and this is probably THE throw-your-fist-in-the-air U2 album.
B00079FUI6|3.0|I bought this dvd set (along with Lost) because I read several reviews saying how great it was.   After watching all of season one of Desperate Housewives, I didn't find it to be particularly great.   <br /> <br />I didn't become very attached to any of the characters and although the show was often interesting and whacky, I didn't find it to be anything overly special, although there were a couple of episodes in the middle of the season which were very exciting. <br /> <br />I will probably watch the set one more time and then sell it.  <br />If you are looking for something different that is somewhat fun to watch, you may want to take a chance and buy this set or rent it.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|This one and only album from Linda dates back to 1970. It has since been remastered with extra tracks that offer insight into Linda's musical experimentations with different instruments and production. The music is really well written and is some of the best psychedelic folk music I've heard. Recommended by none other than Mikael Akerfeldt of the band Opeth, I had to give this a try. As usual Mikael is spot on with this recommendation. Parallelograms comes off as a beautifully crafted \\"acid trip\\" type of folk music with little surprises inserted throughout to add interest to what is already, quality music. If you're familiar with the mind bending works of bands like Comus, you'll love this.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|The Eurythmics singles were always much better than the complete albums they came from and The Ultimate Collection gathers together their greatest hits plus two new songs.  \\"Here Comes The Rain Again\\" is their finest moment and one of the best singles from the 80's.  \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\\" was their lone number one single and is a great synth-pop song while \\"Would I Lie To You?\\" has a crunching guitar riff and blazing horn section.  \\"I Saved The World Today\\" from their late 90's comeback album is a beautiful track.  The two new songs open and close the album.  The upbeat \\"I Got A Life\\" is the opener and better of the two songs with a downcast \\"Was It Just Another Affair\\" closing out the album.  The Eurythmics made some of the 80's most intelligent and best produced songs and they still hold up twenty years later.
015603008X|5.0|A beautiful story, if there ever was. So thought provoking and moving that after i had read the simple sentence that concluded it all \\"put flowers of Algernon's grave, thanks\\" I had to get up and run with the accumulation of fear and frustration left in me by the book. <br /> <br />I dont know where to begin. I guess what really moved me about the book was the ultimate differnce between the two charles. Both were human in the end and both could dream. One understood his surroundings more but the other was blissful becuase of his inability to not understand his surroundings. Did it matter? One was happy and the other was not. It really came down to which one <br />was more fit to live. In the end the intelligent one was the one fit to live, but at the same time the one who died.  <br /> <br />My other was Algernon. I felt that in both stages of Charley's existence Algernon was the true companion. The humans were either gods or fools, but Algernon was always a force that Charly could relate to. Algernon was not a hypocrit or controling. He was Charley's companion and the one being who he could truely relate too at both levels of his intelligence.
B00003CXXS|3.0|I like the thrills and the overall rush you get from the Jurassic Park films thus far, even if none come close to the suspense, and originality of the first film. But can't we come up with a new premise, i mean come on, a lost unknown island in the second movie, where Jeff Goldblum goes to rescue his X wife. And now the third with the same island that Dr.Grant gets conned into landing on from a group of normal suburban tile selling folks, who can't afford to pay him for his duties, but can hire professinals to fly a plain and protect them with guns on the island. Well this premise is more enjoyable than The Lost Worlds at least. I guess all in all i can't complain much, these movies are about Dino-CGI's and being chased and having fun with it, not much else. I just wish when or IF they make number 4 they are a little more clever with how they execute the plot. For instance what ever happen to the Barbasol shaving cream can that went under the mud when Newman got killed in the first film while trying to escape?? Maye we should use that for the next one. So Jurassic Park 3 is more of the same, run, hide, or be eaten.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I have to agree with the critics, this is a great album. Not the best since Violator as Songs of Faith was equally good. Ultra appeared to be a continuation on Songs, sort of formulaic. The song writing wasnt as strong. But then some of the nice songs on violator and Faith were lifted by the magnificent ones surrounding them.   <br />  This deserves 5 stars no doubt about that but it doesnt cover any new ground. Even Gahan's songs fit in perfectly. Perfectly Depeche Mode! Violator was stunning, encapsulating Depeche Mode's development as a band so far. Songs of Faith and Devotion was stunning and shocking! With the heavy guitar and the chunky sound. <br />  Playing the angel is stronger than Ultra in its consistency and way stronger than Exciter. Exciter was an understated effort. Impressive and interesting, but could have been so much better. <br />  Whether you are a Depeche Mode fan or not, this is money well spent. Great Songs, amazing instrumentation and yes, David Gahan singing!
0765340798|2.0|Having gone through 5 prequel books I wanted to read this volume. Unfortunately, it is exceedingly difficult to get through. <br /> <br />Plot and characterization are extremely shallow. Many things are repetitious. Not only the story and explanations, but even choice of words. For instance, if you see the word javelin, you just now that it's going to be paired with balista. <br /> <br />As it is, apart from subject-matter, to me it has very little to do with the original series. And although it was never to be expected that it would, considering the sheer genius of the original series, it could have had such better treatment than it has got here. <br /> <br />Viewed for and by itself as a book of science ficton, it just does not come up to par.
B00004ZD69|5.0|This was the first God Speed album I ever heard, and untill this day I've been a huge fan. This is probally thierbest album, but I wouldn't give any of thier other albums less then a 4 1/2.  <br /> <br />The only way to describe it (for me) is a musical journy into the ends of human civilization.  <br /> <br />Amazing.
0316172324|5.0|The point of the book was not that snap judgements are always correct. The author shows how more factors than just logic come into play when making decisions, and how if we rely soley on logic we can reach wrong conclusions.  <br /> <br />It was an easy read but very thought provoking. I liked this book much more than \\"Freakonomics\\" because the author is not using the book as a vehicle to impress the reader with how smart he is (although he clearly is, and is a good writer, but he lets his work speak for him). <br />
B00005JO1G|1.0|This movie is a big disappointment when it comes to a portrayal of what it means to be a Marine. As a former Marine, I found it insulting and to say the least lame. The film portrayed marines as being a group of adolescents whose sole  activity consisted of masturbation. Whoever wrote the sript obviously had no idea of what it was to be a Marine. The casting of Foxx as a Staff sergeant whose vocabulary consisted of one word, which is unprintable here, was the pitts. If you want to see what it was like in the old days, then see \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" or the \\"D.I.\\",  those were the good old days when they separated the men from the boys in the first 3 days.
0007113323|5.0|This book emerged onto a highly competitive market already burgeoning with numerous field guides covering the region, most by renowned authors and many having benefitted from improvement over several editions. Quite simply though, this book won instant recognition as the best field guide available for Europe - and perhaps a model for field guides everywhere. Its authors are well known experts in their field having spent many years studying and publishing on the birds of the region. However, the key to the guide's success is the fact that so much more useful information has been condensed into a guide which is much the same size as existing books. The book boasts excellent illustrations, succinct text and handy maps, all presented on a the same page. Small enough to fit into a pocket (about the same size as the National Geographic guide) and cheap, it is a must for anyone visiting Europe. As one reviewer has already pointed out, it is indispensable in Alaska too - not just for Palaearctic vagrants, but for regular shorebirds and some residents. Don't hesitate!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This was a very inventive re-telling of a classic story.  I have seen the original many times and even though it will always remain a classic, it has become kind of stale. <br /> <br />Tim Burton has given a fresh perspective and wonderful visuals to the story.  The music is upbeat and the characters are a little more developed.  I could not imagine another actor who could better portray Willy Wonka's eccentric behavior other than Johnny Depp.  He gives an amazing performance as the wacky chocolatier. <br /> <br />If you are a die hard fan of the original, you may be disappointed in this movie...but if you are already a fan of Tim Burton then you already know what to expect.
B000083LQB|4.0|I agree with both sides on this one. On one side, this record sounds 100% better (no pun intended) than the original. I saw them live last year and this remaster actually sounds really close to their live sound. On the other hand, the reissue is priced at a rediculous amount. The solution? By it used like I did. I got it off of half.com for $13 (plus shipping). It's definately worth it just for the sound quality alone, let alone the additional b-sides, nice packaging, and liner notes.
0312995423|1.0|I so enjoyed \\"The DaVinci Code\\" that I afterwards bought Dan Brown's earlier book, \\"Angels and Demons\\".  The earlier book was OK, but it showed that it was an earlier effort that lead up to the better paced and better written DaVinci Code.<br /><br />Last month, I bought Dan Brown's \\"Digital Fortress\\" as a book-on-tape (CD actually) to listen to on my commute, and looked forward to it with pleasure. If Brown was getting better with each book, this one was going to be a lulu.  I notice that Amazon.com shows both the hardback and paperback versions of \\"Digital Fortress\\" with 2004 publish dates.  I assume, that this is the result of one of two scenarios:<br /><br />1)  The 2004 edition is a reissue, and this book was originally written and published long before \\"Angels and Demons\\".<br /><br />2)  This book was written before \\"Angels and Demons\\", but never published before, due to its absymal quality, and was only published last year because of the phenomonal success of \\"The DaVinci Code\\".<br /><br />I assume one of these is correct based on two observations:<br /><br />A)  \\"Digital Fortress\\" has a lot of computer references, and said references are archaic for a story written in 2004.<br /><br />B)  The writing in \\"Digital Fortress\\" is abysmal, which could be indicative of an author's first effort.<br /><br />Either that, or it was ghost-written by an 11-year old.<br /><br />After weaving such an intricate plot in The DaVinci Code, you would have thought Brown was an expert in plots. The lack of such expertise in \\"Digital Fortress\\" indicates it may be an earlier effort.  In Digital Fortress, the action revolves around an \\"idiot plot\\".  An \\"idiot plot\\" is a phrase I'm borrowing from a movie reviewer, the definition of which is, \\"a plot which unfolds only because everybody acts like an idiot\\".  That's Digital Fortress in a nutshell.  The characters' actions and reactions defy common intelligence, much less common sense. Digital Fortress is the poster child for the \\"idiot plot\\".<br /><br />But that's not the worst part of this novel.  We've all read a book or seen a movie where the plot was silly, but we still enjoyed it because the characters and writing lifted the story above the plot.  Well, Digital Fortress does not rise above anything. I have an unabridged version, so the awfulness of this book can't be blamed on any editing.  This book is simply badly written.<br /><br />The story revolves around a professor, David, and his fiancee, Susan, a master cryptographer at the National Security Agency.  She is professional and intelligent.  I'd like to give you the flavor of the writing.  In one part, a fellow cryptographer, in talking about the NSA, quotes a Latin phrase, and then translates it to English for Susan, \\"Who will guard the guards\\".  That is, if the NSA has all-encompassing ability to snoop on everyone else in order to guard America, who will guard America against the possibility of NSA abuse.<br /><br />So....  the coworker makes the comment.  And the cryptographer thinks to herself, and I'm not quoting the book, this gives you an idea...<br /><br />\\"She stared at him in confusion.  What was he talking about?  What could he mean?  Greg could be so irritating.  She thought and she thought. What was he talking about?  She didn't understand. Who will guard the guards?  Her mind whirled.  Her world seemed to be crashing around her.  And where was David?  Who will guard the guards? He wasn't making sense.  She stared at him in confusion.\\"<br /><br />On and on and on.  As a person with a 1,700 book home library, including many volumes of books-on-tape, I'm one who likes to keep books, or, at the very least, pass them on for others to enjoy.  For me to consider throwing a \\"book\\" away (in whatever form), it must be really hopeless.  But that's the point I've reached on Digital Fortress.  I am only on CD #4 out of 10 CD's and I am seriously considering throwing this away without finishing it.  The only reason I haven't is that Ispent good money on this set.<br /><br />Thank you for letting me vent!<br /><br />Happy Readerspent good money on this set.<br /><br />Thank you for letting me vent!
B000093BDX|5.0|THE MUSIC COULDNT BE ANY BETTER.THE SOUND GREAT,EXCEPT 12 OF THE 30 TRACKS APPEAR TO BE PURE MONO !!WHY!! I HAVE ALL THESE SONGS ON LP,AND THEY ARE IN STEREO. THIS REMINDS ME SPECTORS BACK TO MONO.NOW MOST OF THOSE SONGS WERE IN STEREO.WHEN ON LP .WHY DO THE RECORDING ENGINEERS THINK WE WANT MONO? WELL I STILL BOUGHT THE ALBUM AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B00013AXEE|3.0|I enjoy reading Stephen King and I love writing, so I bought a copy with great expectations. I found it disappointing in both structure and advice. The first 100 or so pages are almost pure biography. Labeled \\"C.V.,\\" this long section describes how King developed as a writer. Unlike the biographical sections of other such works (Norman Mailer's The Spooky Art, for example), most of the biographical stories have only the merest connection to learning the craft of writing. I couldn't help thinking that King desired to write an autobiography to immortalize friends and family, but didn't take the plunge and so instead lumped it into his book on writing.<br /><br />The latter part of the book provides his advice on fiction writing, much of which is excellent and compelling. However, some of the advice understandably mirrors weaknesses that appear in King's own writing. I remember a high school friend commenting (he'd just finished The Mist, I believe) that King couldn't \\"write a good ending to save his life.\\" This failing is well explained by his dislike for outlining and pre-conceived conclusions.<br /><br />An English professor of mine called it \\"grooming your own thicket.\\" When writing without a clear idea of the conclusion, most writers have a snarled mess by the time they reach page 50. The branches of unresolved plot, so clear in the beginning, have grown out of control and enmeshed the writer in chaos.<br /><br />If you're a beginning writer, realize that Stephen King is a one in a million writer (as proven by his incredible success) and what works for him may not work for you.
0689877692|5.0|You might find yourself telling your young child, \\"Do not touch!\\" This pop-up book is an elegant, beautiful object, or series of objects, one on each fold-out spread. I laughed and marvelled the first time I opened it, and continue to do so every time I open it again. It's nominally a number book, counting from 1 to 10. Each page opens to create a wonderful 3-D construction, each hiding one red dot. One page wiggles as you pull a tab, one makes noise as zigzags rub against each other, one has 9's that dangle from Seuss-like trees. They're all great fun.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The beauty of this music and the angelic voices never fail to bring a surge of emotion that wells up inside of me, almost to the point of tears. This is as pure as music can be, as perfect as human voices can be, embodied by these four heavenly artists. My words only hint at how this music has affected me. Breathtaking!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Love this movie and thoroughly pleased there will be two more movies made. I do wish they could continue the series as well.  <br /> <br />One of the best sci fi movies I have ever seen...if you can call it sci fi. It mixes in so many genres...sci fi, western, kung fu, horror and comedy. So so good.  <br /> <br />Its a crime this didn't do better in the theaters. Even my friends who have never seen the television show loved this movie.  <br /> <br />Best movie I have seen this year. Can't wait to buy it.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This has to be one of the best CD's I have heard in quite a long time. Every single song is great; my personal favorite thing about this band is that you can sing along to every one of their songs. My favorite song is 'Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off'. The words are also very easy to understand, and do not run together like the words in some other bands' songs. If you are looking for something extremely original and fun, that is also rocking, and able to be danced to, then pick up this album. You won't be disappointed.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One beautiful unemployed day I figured what the heck I have no job to go to anymore and I have Netflix, maybe I should take a chance and rent a series. Thankfully I had rented Firefly, just weeks after it was cancelled from the Gorram Fox station. Even though I thought I wouldn't enjoy the show because I'm no great Sci-Fi fan I ended up loving it so much I bought the set and then spent the rest of my time talking about the show to anyone that would listen to me. Since then I roamed the browncoats network looking for tid bits about this show hoping that it would be ressurected by maybe the sci-fi channel (who opted to pass inorder to get the Tremors series, yeah good move dummies) thus the whole idea of a major motion picture was born, thanks in part to people like me who spent their hard earned cash on the set making it one of the highest selling on Amazon. When the flick came out I loved it. Loved it so much I saw it more then once. Loved it so much I just had to have the three part series of comic books that gapped the time between the final Firefly episode (Objects In Space) and the film (Serenity). Needless to say I was a tad bit dissapointed with the comics (basically you learn that a villain from the first episode lives and wants revenge and that Book leaves because he is forgetting himself and eventually kills someone). Regardless of how this DVD is done up (outtakes, deleted scenes, what have you) I would buy it simply because the film is one of the best. In the end though you'll hear all about how this film didn't make enough money but once again I have to blame the money men. I hardly recall seeing a preview for this film and when I did it took the movie completely out of context. Years of horrible movies coming out and an overall box office slump probably played a part as well but if anything rent this film and I gaurantee you'll find yourself owning it and maybe even the Firefly set for good measure. On one final note you can catch the Serenity soaring the skies in the Battlestar Galactica mini-series (the series FX is done by the same company) for about 30 seconds.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|Its one thing to NOT release the ORIGINAL Theatrical Cuts..its another to re re re re re re release the same SE editions over and over again. DO NOT BUY THESE.Its just another commercial pile of junk. HOw Greedy can one person and a corporation be??Ask the RIAA???
0375508414|5.0|I'd seen the movie ages ago, much too long ago to really remember. The book was wonderful. <br /> <br />It's interesting to me that this story rides more on the colorfulness of the characters than the plot. There's not really any one direct plot, it's more like a series of stories and adventures that add to the growth of the many characters of Whistle Stop. I also liked how Evelyn's character changed and grew, and how the story was told a lot through her visits with Ninny Threadgoode. Very interesting way of going about it. <br /> <br />Overall, loved this book. Loved hearing about the pre-Civil Rights South, Idgie and Ruth's relationship...A book in which one can get lost. Highly recommended.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Is it as good as the original? Yes, it is. In fact I think it's much better than the original. All the usual themes and visual elements that Tim Burton is known for are present (i.e. separated families, an isolated outsider, and crooked houses). Johnny Depp is perfectly goofy and plays the role of Willy Wonka as an alienated outsider, locked away from the rest of the world (much like in Edward Scissorhands). In fact when you actually see Willy Wonka for the first time he's wearing large, round sunglasses and just looking at him you feel as if he's an alien from another planet who's just dropped in for a friendly visit.<br /><br />Tim Burton shows us the psychological side of Willy Wonka. Where did he come from? What's he's fascination with candy? And why is he all alone? Which helps provide a really nice character for Depp to wildly play out. Depp's Willy Wonka is a real nut-job, he's weird looking, and talks funny, and it's more effective than Gene Wilder's performance, because Willy Wonka should be really weird. The film is visually dazzling, the acting is superb, and the cast is absolutely spot-on-perfect! I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of people out there who'll absolutely hate it, but I loved it! Tim Burton really exceeded my expectations with this film.<br /><br />The 2-Disc Deluxe Edition DVD is somewhat of a let-down. There's a few behind-the-scenes featurettes about the casting, visual effects, set designs, how they created the Oompa-Loompas, how they did the scene involving dozens of squirrels and a featurette on how they created the chocolate river, that will make your mouth water in delight. There's also a documentary on Roald Dahl, the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. There's also some interactive games for the kiddies, but nothing that interesting. Some of the featurettes are fun and entertaining, but when added all together, is rather short, about an hour long. It would have also been nice to get an audio commentary from director Tim Burton. I've always liked listening to his commentaries on his other films (Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish, Batman, Edward Scissorhands). The Deluxe Edition may not be super-awesome, but it's still a better purchase than the single disc version that's also available.always liked listening to his commentaries on his other films (Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish, Batman, Edward Scissorhands).

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|A Beautiful Lie is the second album for the amazing band Thirty Seconds To Mars.  The 12 tracks on this album are each individual and phenominal to say the least.  Anything you can possibly want you will find within these songs.  The first single off of the CD, Attack, will have you yelling along with Jared Leto by the time you get to the second chorus and you will stay right there with him until the very last chords of Hunter.  It is at that moment that you'll remember to breathe.  Please don't pass this CD by.  If you're already a fan of the first CD, be prepared for something completely different yet even more unbelievable than the Self Titled album.  If this is your first time experiencing this band, please go out and also pick up the 2002 self titled CD which you will love just as much as this one.
B00000DOYH|5.0|Physical Graffiti (1975.), Led Zeppelin's sixth studio album<br /><br />By the mid-1970's, Led Zeppelin had achieved more than most bands could ever hope to manage. The band, to this point had released 5 albums, each of them different, excellent and constantly pushing musical boundaries. Plus the band were at the height of their popularity. You would surely think that the band couldn't possibly have anything else speacial in the can. However, not Led Zeppelin; this band were not finished. Lead guitarist, Jimmy Page's desire for a double album became evident and this ultimately led to this album, Physical Graffiti. This next ambitious project from the band went gold on advanced orders alone and has since become one of Led Zeppelin's more popular albums (not that any of their albums aren't popular!). So, is this famous album depicting the multi-storey buildings in New York on the front cover really worth its weight in multi-platinum?<br /><br />Eventhough this album is no longer either my all time favourite album, or my favourite Led Zeppelin album (I personally think that its a close second behind Houses of the Holy), this work is still of tremendous importance to me. This was THE album that originally got me into Led Zeppelin and indeed hard rock in general; and I sure haven't regretted it in the time since. 'Physical Graffiti' had me hooked from the first listen. I couldn't get enough of the classic riffs of 'Trampled Underfoot', 'Sick Again' or the sheer beauty of 'Kashmir' or 'Ten Years Gone'. This 80 minute double album has everything; vintage rocking Zeppelin, the more experimental side to the band and the acoustic side. Led Zeppelin truly kept up the pace with this album and made it 6/6 great album releases. Interestingly, when this album originally charted, all of the band's previous 5 works were still in the top 100 charts. 'Physical Graffiti' is also a landmark in some respects for the band; apart from featuring 7 tracks with JP Jones on keyboard, it was also one of the first albums to feature a major string section in one of its tracks, 'Kashmir'. The album as a whole is a mix of up to date (at the time tracks) but also a number of outtake tracks from previous albums. This fan favourite album is a winner all of the way and keeps the listener interested throughout.<br /><br />Disc one of the album opens with the rocking 'Custard Pie'. Page's scratchy riff is great and the song as a whole has great confidence and control. The beat is classic Zeppelin. A few drum beats follow and we're into 'The Rover', a 1972 out-take song. Another rocking song with a great bluesy driven riff. Next is the epic, 'In My Time OF Dying'. At 11 minutes, you need to give this song a few listens (I took a while to really appreciate it) however you will find it to be an amazing track. Based on a Southern USA country style, it has some clever quiet passages and some powerful choruses with Plant giving a stellar performance on the vocals. The 'dying cough' ending is classic. Following this is 'Houses Of The Holy', the out-take title track from the previous album's recording session. For a leftover, this song is awesome; catchy, memorable and hard rocking. Page's guitar exit solo is brilliant. Things then get even better with 'Trampled Under Foot'. This track has real attitude with a cool underlying keyboard harmony from JP Jones that really makes this track unique. The riff to the song is awesome. Then ... we come to 'Kashmir', the legendary song and best of the album. Using a string orchestra backing, this eastern based song is hard to better for innovation. Words can't really do this masterpiece of a song justice.<br /><br />So as you can see, disc one is a classic album on its own! Disc two is great but it doesn't quite shape up as well as the first half of the album. There are two real classics on this half of the album. The first is 'Ten Years Gone'. Moody, atmospheric and captivating, this 6 minute track has it all. Page jams out plenty ofinspirational melodies and Plant gives one of his most bold and commanding performances. The other really great song is the closer 'Sick Again'. Some people strangely have passed this rocking gem off as filler ... my response is HOW DARE THEY!!! 'Sick Again' is one of the bands most energetic and powerful rock songs; Page's guitar work is a killer. That's not to say that the rest of disc two is substandard though. 'In The Light' is a climatic eight minute epic that is a bit slow in parts but non the less has a classic chorus. 'Bron Yr-Aur' is a short acoustic piece which is a pleasant listen and 'The Wanton Song' is a great jam. The rest of the disc are interesting leftovers from previous albums. 'Down By The Seaside' is catchy but a little commercial sounding and 'Night Flight' is an average rock song. 'Boogie With Stu' is an intersting one, incorporating piano to a country and western style and the follow up, 'Black Country Woman' is slower but in a similar vein.<br /><br />'Physical Graffiti' is without doubt, one of the band's best albums. The first half of the album contains some of the band's best work and if it wasn't for a few average songs on the second half, I would possibly have said this was the band's best album. That said, 'Physical Graffiti' is a must buy; you simply can't miss out on great songs like 'Kashmir' or 'Trampled Underfoot'. This epic and in some ways diverse masterpiece is well worth buying even if you are not massively into the band's music.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10Plant gives one of his most bold and commanding performances.

B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is one of the most excellent pieces of work ever recorded. <br /> <br />They are a great band and can be weighed up against the likes of Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, and even the genius of bartok and bach in terms of pure unadulterated musicality. <br /> <br />They have extreme depth and do music worthy of the highest possible scores. I suggest you buy this album outright. <br /> <br />As for the comparisons to Pablo Honey and other Radiohead albums this one wins by far, this is definitly Radiohead at their best.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|This is the way to do it! All the other Batman movies were lame ducks. In this one, acting goes from good to extraordinary good. Visuals are superb. Cinematography is excellent, darkish, ominous looking, just can't be any better. Stunts and fight sequences are magnificent.    Any low point? Yes. My main problem was the water-down violence, in search of a PG-13 rating. That was bad. Let's look at it for a second. Batman is a crime fighter. Criminals do evil things, are ruthless, kill everybody and shoot twice at the wounded. So Batman is a goody-goody fellow, never kills anybody except by chance or accident, and avoids romantic involvenment.    Well, that is not good in my agenda. But that is just me. It is my usual complain against PG-13 ratings which kill potential great movies by turning us into grown-up children.     Film violence is always carefully choreographed to avoid injuries. In this movie they go to the borderline, and the actors perform their own stunts most of the time, adding realism to the action. Thus, the fighting sequences are great. However, in order to make it less shocking, the scenes are filmed mostly in close-ups and with fast editing. Remember the \\"Moulin Rouge\\" disaster? Just similar. Too bad. Bruce Lee did it best 30 years ago. All his fighting scenes are shot from a distance, so the viewer can see the whole body of the hero and his foes.    That said, this Batman is the real thing. I hope the sequels are equally relevant to the saga.    Did I forget something? Well, yes... the Batmobile. In this movie is called The Tumbler and I assure you, is the coolest, greatest Batmobile ever. It's sooo wonderful that they should get Detroit to manufacure so people could drive it to the supermarket or kids to school.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti (1975.), Led Zeppelin's sixth studio album<br /><br />By the mid-1970's, Led Zeppelin had achieved more than most bands could ever hope to manage. The band, to this point had released 5 albums, each of them different, excellent and constantly pushing musical boundaries. Plus the band were at the height of their popularity. You would surely think that the band couldn't possibly have anything else speacial in the can. However, not Led Zeppelin; this band were not finished. Lead guitarist, Jimmy Page's desire for a double album became evident and this ultimately led to this album, Physical Graffiti. This next ambitious project from the band went gold on advanced orders alone and has since become one of Led Zeppelin's more popular albums (not that any of their albums aren't popular!). So, is this famous album depicting the multi-storey buildings in New York on the front cover really worth its weight in multi-platinum?<br /><br />Eventhough this album is no longer either my all time favourite album, or my favourite Led Zeppelin album (I personally think that its a close second behind Houses of the Holy), this work is still of tremendous importance to me. This was THE album that originally got me into Led Zeppelin and indeed hard rock in general; and I sure haven't regretted it in the time since. 'Physical Graffiti' had me hooked from the first listen. I couldn't get enough of the classic riffs of 'Trampled Underfoot', 'Sick Again' or the sheer beauty of 'Kashmir' or 'Ten Years Gone'. This 80 minute double album has everything; vintage rocking Zeppelin, the more experimental side to the band and the acoustic side. Led Zeppelin truly kept up the pace with this album and made it 6/6 great album releases. Interestingly, when this album originally charted, all of the band's previous 5 works were still in the top 100 charts. 'Physical Graffiti' is also a landmark in some respects for the band; apart from featuring 7 tracks with JP Jones on keyboard, it was also one of the first albums to feature a major string section in one of its tracks, 'Kashmir'. The album as a whole is a mix of up to date (at the time tracks) but also a number of outtake tracks from previous albums. This fan favourite album is a winner all of the way and keeps the listener interested throughout.<br /><br />Disc one of the album opens with the rocking 'Custard Pie'. Page's scratchy riff is great and the song as a whole has great confidence and control. The beat is classic Zeppelin. A few drum beats follow and we're into 'The Rover', a 1972 out-take song. Another rocking song with a great bluesy driven riff. Next is the epic, 'In My Time OF Dying'. At 11 minutes, you need to give this song a few listens (I took a while to really appreciate it) however you will find it to be an amazing track. Based on a Southern USA country style, it has some clever quiet passages and some powerful choruses with Plant giving a stellar performance on the vocals. The 'dying cough' ending is classic. Following this is 'Houses Of The Holy', the out-take title track from the previous album's recording session. For a leftover, this song is awesome; catchy, memorable and hard rocking. Page's guitar exit solo is brilliant. Things then get even better with 'Trampled Under Foot'. This track has real attitude with a cool underlying keyboard harmony from JP Jones that really makes this track unique. The riff to the song is awesome. Then ... we come to 'Kashmir', the legendary song and best of the album. Using a string orchestra backing, this eastern based song is hard to better for innovation. Words can't really do this masterpiece of a song justice.<br /><br />So as you can see, disc one is a classic album on its own! Disc two is great but it doesn't quite shape up as well as the first half of the album. There are two real classics on this half of the album. The first is 'Ten Years Gone'. Moody, atmospheric and captivating, this 6 minute track has it all. Page jams out plenty ofinspirational melodies and Plant gives one of his most bold and commanding performances. The other really great song is the closer 'Sick Again'. Some people strangely have passed this rocking gem off as filler ... my response is HOW DARE THEY!!! 'Sick Again' is one of the bands most energetic and powerful rock songs; Page's guitar work is a killer. That's not to say that the rest of disc two is substandard though.

B00005JO1G|1.0|A man and his rifle... the haunting memories of war that Swafford had to go through are unimaginable. Now, if we forget about the real ravages of war, we might be tempted to believe this young man. However just one glance at Saving Private Ryan gives us a different impression of what war is like. The reality of war is far worse than what we see in Saving Private Ryan or Jarhead, for that matter. No one should discount what a soldier goes through while at war; however, exaggerations were unwarranted given the short time those soldiers spent in Iraq.<br /><br />The plot as I understood it, was supposed to be the life of a soldier in the US Marine Core. The life of a soldier can be very uninspiring and to some extent boring to the outside world. No real heroes were supposed to be identified in this movie, and to that extent no real action either. However, Sam Mendes tries, and fails miserably, to enchant us with something that reminds us of past war movies such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and so on. There is even a point in the movie where you hear The Doors singing. Swafford makes a remark about the fact that they should play their own music and not Vietnam music. Sam continues to un-inspire us with some really bad attempts to make Swafford look like a bad ass soldier. It didn't work. I kept thinking he was dreaming...<br /><br />What I liked in this movie is the cinematography, but the cinematography alone is not enough to account for what turned out to be an over hyped account of a soldier life in the Gulf War I. There are references to what happens when a soldier is away that simply were not properly exposed. For instance, the cheating girlfriend part was overplayed when instead it could have been added as a background story to add a dramatic effect to the fact that war is hell even if you are never deployed overseas.<br /><br />There are other insignificant positives worth noting. For example, Jamie Foxx was a good choice, but his acting was cut short and made inappropriate at times. Some of the songs were quite good and seemed to be well placed.<br /><br />The bad side of this movie, which seems to be prevalent, is that acting seemed to be a little exaggerated. Jake Gyllenhaal does not strike me as a tough soldier at all. Jake is the quiet type (at least from his looks). Sam Mendes could've added a different role for this young man.<br /><br />The storyline is the other bad bullet. It poorly highlights the little things we cannot begin to appreciate in less than two hours. At the same time the movie references Albert Camus, who happens to be a principal luminary in existentialism. The reference is badly disposed of as if it never even happened. A better reference (at least for humor's sake) would have been War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy.<br /><br />That's it...<br />--Willimes.

B000002H97|3.0|There are clearly two types of people here: the idiots that give this album anymore than 3 stars and the people who know their stuff. <br /> <br />This album MIGHT have been nice as an experimental album but after this they never bounced back.  They slowed down simplified their songs, got rid of almost all the thrash element, made music videos and changed the song themes (notice there are a lot more introspective songs).  If this had been their only album they did this on I might be a little more generous in my opinion of this, because then it wouldn't be a sell-out album.  But since they have just gotten worse they basically committed suicide with this album. <br /> <br />Now, even the quality of the songs aren't that good.  I'll admit they're not as bad as their later songs but look at what they did: <br /> <br />-Lars starting sucking by playing the most simplistic drumming with no real fills <br />-no double bass (or if there was I missed it) <br />-Kirk's made his solos mediocre (I can't think of one actually GOOD solo on this entire album) <br />-most of the lyrics aren't as good or are just cheesy and suck (\\"Off to never, Neverland\\" or \\"I'm your dream, make you real/I'm your eyes when you must steal/I'm your pain when you can't feel/Sad but true\\") <br />-not one real fast song on the entire album <br />-James sings like a country singer, no growls or screams anymore <br />-there are no crazy basslines like Cliff did (sorry to keep bringing up Cliff, Jason) <br />-a lot of the music is repetitive and dull <br />-nothing on this album really pumps you up and makes you bang your head and act like a wild, rabid animal <br /> <br />I actually commented on the songs themselves here, so please, p**sies, don't try to make it like I just don't like this album because it's more mainstream than their earlier work. <br /> <br />Now some idiots say that a band should progress.  Well, it's fine if they progress but it's called selling out when they change their music completely as well as change genres, do stupid s**t just to get popular and stray from their roots. <br /> <br />Others say this album is awesome and those that disagree are iditos and just like anything that's not mainstream.  Well, first off, refer to the above and second, you're the idiots who probably bought this album as their first Metallica album so that's the first thing that was forever ingrained in your mind of Metallica.   <br /> <br />The production is nice in some aspects but worse in others.  Yes, the \\"quality\\" is better but it's not as raw as their other stuff. <br /> <br />Their previous albums blow this out of the water.  In fact, this album is just short of being a piece of crap compared to them.   <br /> <br />All in all, an album much better than the crap you'll hear on the radio, but a mediocre to average album compared to their previous godly releases.  This one isn't even real thrash!  The only real tracks I can get really get into are \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Through The Never\\".  \\"Enter Sandman\\" is way overrated.
B000003S0D|5.0|I was hesitant to write a review for this great CD because when you think about it, we all have different taste. What is 5 stars for one person is 1 star for another. Anyhow I'll say my 2 cents worth. I have been fascinated with King Crimson from 1969 when I bought their first CD. I still like King Crimson but prefer the period between \\"Lizard\\" and \\"Red\\". Out of all the CD's that King Crimson have produced over the years I can pick 5 CD's that were released in a row that were absolutely outstanding without one bad song. They are - Lizard, Islands, Larks Tounges in Aspic, Starless and Bible Black and Red. Those 5 albums were otherworldly. Every time I play them, I marvel that such painfully beautifull music could be written and performed. So, regarding Lizard, from the very opening note till it's melancholy last note this album is pure magic. The music moves me and stirs up emotions that few other performers have had the ability to do. This CD had the perfect blend of classical and rock. If I had to leave my burning house, I would grab those 5 CD's I mentioned earlier and run from the flames.

B000AGTPUA|5.0|This is, for those of us who have always loved the Christmas season, an amazing journey. I found myself going back over fifty years to the Christmases I remember as a child.

I would encourage those who enjoy the season as much as I do to get the DVD and share it with family and friends during the joyous Christmas season.
B000001F3C|4.0|I've listened to all of U2's albums many times over and have often found myself putting a different album at the top of the heap depending on my mood at the time.  Of all their works there are only three albums that I have never thrown on top - October, Rattle & Hum, and War. <br /> <br />War has got some fantastic music.  I think the first three songs easily rival the 1-2-3 punch of The Joshua Tree.  By my count there are six great songs on this album: Sunday Bloody Sunday, Seconds, New Year's Day, Two Hearts Beat as One, Surrender, and \\"40\\".  The midpoint of this record somewhat fizzles.  Like a Song is alright but overlong and it gets boring after a bit.  Drowning Man is slow and fails to capture you at all, never coming close to the moodiness on the previous album, October, or the atmosphere that makes that album so good.  The Refugee was a great song at first, but it doesn't hold you at all.  None of these songs is a horrible listen, but I wouldn't suggest that any of them is U2 at it's best.  The last song on the album that I don't care as much for is Red Light.  It's more upbeat, not quite as boring, and brings in some horns but it ultimately never really goes anywhere.   <br /> <br />The band experiment a little more heavily on this album and get more outside of the four piece mentaility by bringing in strings, additional backup singers, and brass.  It's clear they were trying to get away from the echoing, frenetic sound of Boy and the somewhat eerie, moody sound of October (though Drowning Man seems to want to recapture this a bit but fails).   <br /> <br />This is still an album well worth owning.  None of the songs are bad and Sunday Bloody Sunday, New Year's Day, and \\"40\\" are classics.  I think Surrender is heavily underrated and think Two Hearts Beat As One comes close to the other classics on the album.  Seconds is a great song also notable for debuting The Edge as the lead singer on a song, at least partially (Bono sings about half of the lines as well).   <br /> <br />Despite my criticism, I like War.  Any band that can claim an album like War to be their worst overall album (at least I will make that claim) is a great band indeed.  Greater things were to come and are still coming as How to Dismantle on Atomic Bomb may be U2's best album.
0064409422|5.0|I watched the animated version of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe when I was a kid, and really liked it.  At the time, I didn't realize that it was a book, or that there were other stories.  Once I ofund out, I read the entire series, and re-read it several times as a kid.  I have meant to read them again for quite a while, but the movie coming out soon finally motivated me to get to it. <br /> <br />The book was as good as I remember, but it did read like a kid's book.  If  didn't have such great memories of reading it while I was a kid, this might have bothered me more, but as it is, it didn't matter to me.  It was also very short, but despite that, Lewis does a great job of introducting us to the world of Narnia and to some great characters. <br /> <br />If you're an adult who hasn't read these before, there probably isn't much point, as the movie will probably do a good job of telling the story on a higher level, but if you're a kid, you should definitely read this series.  Although, make sure you start with this book first, even though they are currently being marketed in chronological order with this book second.  This is the first book in the series (it says as much at the end of the book), and reading them first in a different order is a great disservice to the story and the reader.

B0000033P0|3.0|You know, after repeated listenings, I have to say that I now find \\"Tarkus Suite\\" to be a lot more cohesive, complex, and even addictive, than I first thought in the (kind of annoying) review below.    But more to the point, my tone in the original review was fatuous and pompous -- not good manners at all.  I was going to edit out some of the more smarmy bits; but then I decided to let the whole thing stand, as evidence that a writer can turn into a windbag pretty quickly if he isn't careful.    It certainly wasn't necessary for me to slag the excellent Carl Palmer, just to praise Bruford or Williams.  And it was disrespectful to the efforts of the musicians.  So, my apologies to them, and to the readers here.    There's lots to say about this challenging work, but I'm going to shut my mouth now.  Rock on, all concerned!    (original text...)  ********    These guys recorded the delightful and amazing \\"Benny the Bouncer,\\" and they clearly had talent to burn, so it's kind of hard to be too critical of them.  (Plus, they made a whole string of albums that were simultaneously big hits, and deeply weird -- try doing that now!)  Nevertheless, for all their fine intentions of bringing jazz inflections and classical structures to a rock audience, one has to finally admit that this album is pretty silly.    Carl Palmer on drums had enough technical chops to make Gene Krupa weep, but I'm sorry, he's a robot.  If you want to hear what truly fluid, flexible jazz-rock drumming sounds like, check out Bill Bruford on the Yes albums 'Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge,'... or listen to Tony Williams, doing pretty much anything that Tony Williams did, back in the 60s with the Miles Davis group.    The main track here, \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" has moments of great beauty and intensity, but in the end it doesn't really hold together: mostly it's just a tidal wave of stuff.  It's all over the place, but in a bad way, lacking thematic unity or structural integrity.  The lyrics are earnest-but-silly in that high-toned, oracular, high-school-yearbook kind of way (again, contrast 'Close to the Edge,' where the lyrics are every bit as silly, but somehow earnestly charming); and a lot of the soloing is technically impressive -- except that the notes are often just sort of spattered about almost at random.  (Again, listen to early-70s Steve Howe --or, dare I say it?-- the Miles Davis of 'In a Silent Way' to hear how an artist as equally skilled as Keith Emerson just chooses his moments with greater care).     And again, when all is said and done, Carl Palmer is a robot.  I'm sorry, it's just true.    The minor track 'Jeremy Bender' is puerile, tasteless, and really kind of beneath them.  Later on, they would cut 'Benny the Bouncer,' which is in the same vein -- except that it's somehow totally classy, and classic.      I think this record made it to #1 in the UK, which shows that the English audience of the time was admirably eager to hear smart, ambitious material.  That's a fine thing, and these fellows gave it a fair shot.  But it's too bad someone couldn't explain to them that, for instance, Curtis Mayfield or The Allman Brothers were (despite their lack of classical pretensions) just about as ambitious and smart as it gets -- only without the fancy pyrotechnic trappings.    Keith, Greg, or Carl, if you're reading this -- God bless you all!  You guys had talent and guts, and in your best moments, you really rocked!  I only say these critical things now to help guide the younger folks (who after all can't be expected to buy or listen to EVERYTHING) to a bit more nourishing fare.  So, to all you kids: check out \\"Karn Evil 9\\" and \\"Close to the Edge,\\" and get a whiff of how it felt to be musically smart and crazy, back in those smart, crazy days.  Cheers.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Not much to say here that hasn't already been said about the film itself, except that this Disney film well deserves the same treatment that Cinderella recently received. The story is not unusual but it is timeless and charming. <br />What must be said above all is that the contribution of Peggy Lee (and Sammy Cahn) to the soundtrack with a handful of songs and the voicing of several characters is what pushes the quality of this film far above any other Disney works of its time or ever since. What a wise decision of Walt's to employ her vast talents. For the record, by Peggy's account Disney was a kind, lovely man who she couldn't have been happier working for. Let's just forget all those rubbish demonic rumours about the great man! The legal battle over royalties Lee unfortunately had to wage against the Disney company was on the release of this film on VHS in 1988. If Walt was around he would have made damn sure she got what she deserved without all that mean corporate penny-pinching. Long live Lady and the Tramp and the inimitable Peggy Lee.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie. It brought back memories of Blade Runner, the Japanese anime Cowboy Bebop, and the EA game Privateer. If you enjoyed any one of these titles, you would probably enjoy this movie as well. Even for people who are not familiar with them, this is great story with a high level human realism (as far as scifi goes). It is not a movie about \\"good\\" vs \\"evil\\" (like Star Wars or Star Trek), but more about a group of people just trying to make it on the fringes of the universe; which if you ask me, is a welcome break from the typical formula of Hollywood scifi movies.

Batman was not the flier we thought he was but he was only a very good acrobat who had very good weapons that threw cables all around and helped him get out of the muddy marshes of life right into the sky. At the end of his metal thread he looked more like a spider swinging in the wind than a bat, but let’s say he was close enough.<br /><br />The main rewriting was not about that technical side of things. The bat mobile was not the great war tool it was supposed to be. It was awkward and did not play a great role. What’s more the flier version of it ended down on the steps to the  cathedral with Batman inside. Not very swift that bat mobile. But well you have to do with what you have and nothing else.<br /><br />The main rewriting was not the car nor the plane nor any of these vulgar means of transportation. The main rewriting was the girl who went through all kinds of traps, tricks, fears and frights in the hands of the Joker or in the hands of Batman. Luckily or unluckily she fell in love. The poor darling! In love with a bat, and they say it drinks blood. But at the same time that makes Batman a real man who can fall in love and have an adventure with a woman. Once again, in 1989 we were still very far away from Proposition 8 in California and the rulings of the Supreme Court in 2014 or is it 2015. It was so earth-shaking that we don’t even remember the date.<br /><br />But Batman knows how to do it in style with champagne and luxurious British cars with the driving wheel on the right side, and door opening the way they haven’t opened for now more than fifty years. That makes the film really attractive and the girl very remarkable since she is able to keep a secret. For a press photographer that is rather amazing. She cancelled her chance to get a Pulitzer Prize. You must admit love has no limits.<br /><br />I guess after a few winter nights spent in solitude and fear she might find the adventure less attractive, but well, we will cross this bridge when we come to it, shall we not?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUnd fear she might find the adventure less attractive, but well, we will cross this bridge when we come to it, shall we not?

B0002VKZL6|4.0|I heard \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" on the radio and just had to buy the CD.  Of course, it's always a risk to buy a CD based on one song - chances are, you'll like that one song, and nothing else.<br /><br />In this case, I like the entire CD, with of course special preference for \\"Postcards\\" - when it comes up in the rotation, I listen to it twice!  It just makes me want to dance!<br /><br />The overall CD feels mellow, but not such that it will put you to sleep.  At times sly (\\"boom, like that\\"), at times funny (\\"sucker row\\"), it's also very sweet in places.  \\"all that matters\\" is such a pretty love song:  \\"my darling girl/my darling girl/you're all that matters/in this wicked world\\"....<br /><br />Technically, I would give the CD 4.5 stars, but of course that's not an option.
B00005MP58|5.0|This series is entrancing, entertaining and enjoyable. All of the characters are wonderfully portrayed to elicit a variety of emotions from the viewer, admiration and affection for Ms. Bennett, exasperation with her mother and younger sisters, scorn for Ms. Bingley, annoyance at Mr. Collins etc. etc.  However, it is the brooding, smoldering, intoxicating Mr. Darcy, played majestically by Colin Firth (there can never be any other actor in this role) that sets this 'film' apart from any and all others. His performance is exceptional and he dominates every scene he appears in and pervades those he does not. The evolution of the love affair between Mr. Darcy and Ms. Elizabeth Bennett is among the greatest love stories ever told. Both actors exceed all expectations in conveying their growing passion for each other, despite their initial objections.  <br />The \\"long and longing looks\\" scene in the music room at Pemberly has got to be one of the most romantic scenes ever caught on film.....enough to melt your heart and flame your own passions. The only disappointment is the truncated last scene when Mr. Darcy and Ms. Elizabeth Bennett finally kiss.......alas it must be left to our imaginations, just as Ms. Austen intended.

0199267170|4.0|This new edition of Oxford's standard anthology of Shakespeare's works has been expanded to include a new general introduction and introduction to each work, an essay on Shakespeare's language, and a new user's guide, among other original features. This favorably reviewed new edition of a classic is a superb way for libraries to provide attractive access to all of Shakespeare's works and introduce these classics to today's readers. (South Texas Library System summary)<br /><br />For individuals, I'd recommend getting each work in a separate volume, preferably one with more notes on each play.  When I studied Shakespeare in college, having an annotated edition really opened up the writing to me.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Did you ever hear the one about the band who were launched by a TV show? Yeah, hilarious isn't it? Many artists have gained exposure through TV shows and TV commercials. Some are success stories, most are not. For every Dido there's The Rembrandts (Roswell and Friends, in case you didn't get the references). Then there are those artists who are better than that song used on the TV show - Gavin De Graw (One Tree Hill) and Remy Zero (Smallville) for example. And there's that crowd from The OC - Phantom Planet and their one hit `California' - a band that didn't deserve even that much success. But The OC does have one success story, and they are called Death Cab For Cutie.    Like Seth, I'm a big DCFC fan, and like him I was partial to them before most people knew either of us existed. The thing about public exposure is that it means more people will go back and buy the older albums - and with a back-catalogue as strong as Death Cab's that's always a good thing. It also meant that they got a major record label deal. Their harder to find releases are now much easier to find too. But what about their new material? Their first step into the world of producing music for the masses. Read on...
B0007TKNCY|5.0|Often considered the definitive screwball comedy, BRINGING UP BABY is Howard Hawks's masterpiece of fast talk, breakneck comic timing, romantic misadventure, and general wackiness. The brilliantly witty dialogue and wicked pace of this film proved to be hugely influential in the years succeeding its production, but no film has managed to surpass this one in its genre.<br /><br />Cary Grant stars as the serious but absent-minded and awkward Dr. David Huxley, a paleontologist who has spent the last four years assembling a brontosaurus skeleton and is hoping to win an important endowment for his museum. Katherine Hepburn plays the zany society heiress Susan Vance who latches on to the nerdy Huxley on the eve of his wedding day and won't let him out of her sight. Falling in love with him on a whim, she is determined to make him love her too.<br /><br />The frantic pace of misadventure that falls upon Huxley and Susan does not let up through the entire film. Centered on searches for a lost dinosaur bone and a pet leopard named \\"Baby,\\" the action is driven by her increasingly daft and wild efforts to romantically capture his interest which result in an increasingly absurd set of mishaps. The daffy and charmingly annoying Susan flusters the strait-laced Huxley causing him to progressively abandon all decorum and propriety, much to his embarrassment.<br /><br />Popping up along the path of these misadventures are a rich and stodgy aunt (May Robson), a stuttering big-game hunter (Charlie Ruggles), a drunken gardener (Barry Fitzgerald), a clueless constable (Walter Catlett), a pompous psychiatrist (Fritz Feld), a straight-laced fiancee (Virginia Walker), and a cagey fox terrier (Asta). Nearly all come together in the climactic jailhouse sequence that wraps up and resolves much of the high jinks of this picture.<br /><br />BRINGING UP BABY is one of the greatest and most enduring comedies on film. Versatile director Hawks literally defined the genre of screwball though, to our loss, Hepburn never starred in another one. Thoroughly accessible to modern audiences, anyone who loves movie comedy should allow themselves the pleasure of this film.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt, to our loss, Hepburn never starred in another one.

B000A2H812|4.0|Russian gyspy polka punk is what we will be discussing today. Anyone still listening? Hopefully at least a few of you decided to hear me out, because it will be worth it. See whereas many people would hear of this seemingly ludicrous combination of styles and be deterred for me it was the main reason that I ended up hearing Gogol Bordello. I absolutely had to know what this was going to sound like. And you know what it sounds like? Exactly what you would expect from Russian gypsy polka punk.    Basically, the sound is that of a drunken bar riot mixed in with accordions, shouting, and spliced with reggae and dub influences throughout. The entire thing sounds like it was recorded with the lead singer so drunk he could hardly stand on his own two feet. He shouts and slurs his words with intensity but never clarity and this is a good thing. Seeing this live must be a total trip, and maybe a dangerous one. Polka on its own is more or less intrinsically lame, but the accordion is not. Pumping up the accordion and setting it against high energy punk music is actually very clever. Much like Yellowcard and their fiddle was a good gimmick except this is a) way better and b) less financially motivated.
0307236722|5.0|`Martha Stewart's Cooking Handbook' is Martha Stewart Omnimedia's first book since Miss Martha has been out of the slammer, and it is her first big book in several years. That, combined with the fact that it's name promises to be a serious manual on baking techniques gives me high expectations for this new title.<br /><br />I am really happy to say the book meets or even exceeds my expectations on almost all points. Like the famous `Boy Scout Handbook' which is exclusively a `how to' book on all the basics, this volume covers virtually all the essential baking techniques, without going into any long explanations on why these are the best techniques. Thus, unlike Sherry Yard's excellent `The Secrets of Baking' or Shirley Corriher's `Cookwise' or Alton Brown's `I'm Just Here for More Food', this book spends no time dwelling on how biscuit baking is very similar to pie crust baking or that cheesecake is not really cake, but a custard pie. Instead, Martha and her very large and expert staff of magazine and book writers, editors, and photographers have assembled and excellent tutorial on most of the basic baking skills.<br /><br />There is another way in which this book is different from most conventional books on baking. It is in the tone I first detected in Martha Stewart's flagship classic, `Entertaining' where she takes the stance of an amateur with good taste and good learning skills, rather than the role of a professional who is showing us amateurs how it's done. This is not to say that we amateurs can't learn a lot from all the baking professionals out there like Peter Reinhart, Rose Levy Beranbaum, Nick Malgieri, and Gayle Ortiz. It's just that Miss Martha sees things from our side of the kitchen counter. This may not explain all the good qualities of this book, but it helps. I think this attitude and the great skill in both describing and picturing techniques means this book is a superb introduction for the beginner, and even for the teen and preteen bakers among us.<br /><br />Lots of books use photographs or drawings to illustrate techniques, but the presence of the pictures is not an automatic path to clarity of presentation. The technique illustrating pictures in this book are simply superb. They seem to leave nothing to the imagination, as when they provide simple pictures illustrating what packed brown sugar looks like, how to measure across the top of a baking pan, and how to prepare the bottom of baking pans with butter, parchment round, followed by more butter. All the photographic experience that has been acquired by doing a monthly magazine has been put to good use.<br /><br />While a purist may object to some elements of this book's organization, it is excellent for a beginner or even an intermediate amateur. Instead of giving us a chapter on quick breads, the book starts with a chapter entitled `Simple Baked Goods' which cover biscuits (five different methods), muffins (four recipes), popovers, scones (four recipes), quick breads (five recipes, including cornbread and Irish soda bread), and cakes (seven recipes). Rather than putting all the tutorial material on techniques in the front of the book, the photo tutorials begin each relevant chapter. So, the first chapter includes lessons on cutting butter into biscuit dough, making and cutting scones, cutting biscuits, and preparing muffin tins. Other specifics appear as sidebars to individual recipes. Thus, the correct method for filling popover pans is shown together with the one popover recipe.<br /><br />The next chapter is on `Cookies'. Just as with the `simple' recipes, the chapter begins with an introduction on good techniques for making cookies, a photo gallery of cookie making tools and tutorials on cookie techniques. Also like the first section, the selection of recipes is very well done. The forty-two recipes certainly don't cover all the ground you will find in a full book on cookies, but a lot of very popular recipes are here. I was particularly interested in the recipe for nut crescents and I was very pleased to find a good representation of exactly now to form the crescents before baking so that the cookies would bake evenly.<br /><br />My favorite subject, yeast breads, is in the next to last chapter on `Yeasted Baked Goods'. Here again, the choice of recipes is excellent, covering virtually all the major bases with at least one or two examples of each major type of European bread, except for naturally yeasted sourdoughs. All recipes use active dry yeast. A professional baker may prefer fresh yeast and some writers are particularly fond of instant yeast, but I first learned yeast baking with active dry yeast and both of the other types have their disadvantages for the amateur.<br /><br />One possible dissonance is the fact that pate brisee recipes (pies, tarts, galettes, etc) and other pastry recipes such as puff pastry and pate a choux are in two different chapters, separated by yeast breads. From a practical point of view, for a `handbook' of techniques, I consider this entirely unobjectionable.<br /><br />One thing I really like about the individual recipes is that in addition to the fact that they seem to leave no important detail out, they also do not introduce a lot of tricks and gimmicks. While I have seen pate brisee recipes with all sorts of different additives to make them work better, Martha Stewart gives us the simplest recipe possible made with flour, salt, butter, and water, period, plus a really nice pictorial tutorial on how to put it all together.<br /><br />Aside from the generally friendly tone and the homey introduction from Martha, there is none of the chatter in headnotes and sidebars you will find in many books. This is all business.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this as a first book on baking techniques and reference for lots of common baking recipes.ested in the recipe for nut crescents and I was very pleased to find a good representation of exactly now to form the crescents before baking so that the cookies would bake evenly.<br /><br />My favorite subject, yeast breads, is in the next to last chapter on `Yeasted Baked Goods'.

B000B0WODA|4.0|To read all of this review or many more like it check out my music review blog @ [...] or in a few check out the brand [...] <br /> <br />One thing is for certain the rest of the planet and myself couldn't get enough of the first album that this band released. The debut album by Franz Ferdinand was something that was largely accepted by the public, with songs like \\"Take Me Out\\", \\"This Fire\\", and \\"Jacquline\\" to name a few, it was hard not to like this album. Now this was back in 2004 so we the listener since that time have been salivating for the chance to hear anything that was new by Franz. They toured for a while and released that album that lots of bands release now where you essentially re-release the first and tack on like a new track or two and maybe throw in a DVD of tour footage. Really that's more for the hardcore fan, I don't really dig all that backstage access stuff I'm just into new music, so if you'd waste less time filming and more time recording like a proper musician then you could satisfy your fans cravings faster. I will admit that I wasn't as excited as I thought I would be for the release of this CD, but I think it was because I had fallen out of that post-punk love that I used to have. To prepare for this new album I wanted to get back into the swing of things in a positive way so I listened to the first album to remind myself why Franz Ferdinand was different than all the rest that seem to blend into the genre. It worked, which is good because it helped me revisit my love of Franz Ferdinand's music and also I am more excited now for the new album than I had been before hearing the first album. All in all Franz will deliver me a saga, and I am curious to see which direction the band has decided to go in what with the success of the first album.
B000ASSDVA|2.0|I saw this film during its first run in 1961.  It was presented in 70mm on a huge screen with outstanding sound.  Rosza's music was always part of the appeal.  The photography was sometimes breathtaking.  The color was rich and beautiful.  Among Heston's epics it was neither Ben Hur nor the Ten Commandments, but there are hundreds of movies of less merit that have been given better treatment than this one.<br /><br />The DVD I have was purchased through Amazon's resale program.  It seems to be of Chinese origin as the subtitles are in that language.  The print is really pretty awful.  The colors seem to bleed and overall the image is not sharp.  The sound is stereo with none of the impact of that 1961 memory.<br /><br />This movie was \\"restored\\" in the early nineties.  I remember seeing Ms. Loren talking about it on one of the morning programs.  But this is not that print.  It is a mere shadow of what might have been.<br /><br />The movie deserves to be presented in a double DVD with full honors of trailers, \\"Making of....\\" and the best print they can come up with.  Sure it's not Lawrence of Arabia -- what is?  Lawrence is by consensus of a half dozen sources one of the three greatest movies of all time.  But El Cid is not about an anti-hero like Lawrence but rather about a principled guy with courage and values.  There IS an audience for that, too.<br /><br />I don't know whether the American rights to this movie are tied up by some estate or some studio, or what.  But it is time to give us the movie with the technical quality of the original.  The movie itself may be a 3 1/2 out of 5.  But the only excuse for this foreign ersatz is as a stopgap until the real thing FINALLY comes out.
B00009Z576|4.0|Yes was one of my favorites for many years.  Drama is a very good album. Not my favorite(close to the edge, Relayer, Tales of Topographic oceans) but I recomend every album from Close to the Edge thru 90125.  I saw a previous review commented that Trevor Horn sounded much like Jon Anderson.  I agree but if you are in the new york city area there used to be a Yes tribute band that plays all the classic yes stuff and their singer sounds just like Anderson.  I think they were called Yesterdays and the guys were perfect, but it was a few years ago.  Anyway if you really love yes you'll want to get the Drama album.  I always find the mix of yes members music with new people to be exciting.  I also recomend Jon Anderson's \\"Olias of sunhillow\\" album, Asia's Asia album and Alpha album(the ones with Steve Howe, Geoff Downes, Carl Palmer, and John Wetton). <br />
B000B7HZXM|4.0|People never cease to amaze me. With the fourth installment of Rod Stewarts American Songook series it should perfectly clear to any and all reviewers exactly what one might find in purchasing one of these discs. Rod and U:ber-Producer Clive Davis set this wheel in motion with the very first release and have nary strayed from that winning formula. So when you stop by your local retailer and decide to purchase a copy of your very own it's painfully obvious what contents within will be found. Yet...here in Amazonland we have yet another slew of one star temper-tantrums ( I refuse to call some of these critiques 'reviews' ) from misguided music-lovers who feel the need to prove to the world just how musically sophisticated they truly are. So getting their knickers in a twist they hurridly get on-line, post a few silly comments and just as hurridly disappear. Of course none of them having actually purchased the disc and giving it a proper listen. Sadly, they ultimately do little more then pollute this fine web-site with opinions that mean very little and prove to the world that some people should have their keyboards taken away from them until they can learn how to play nice. But thats the price we pay for certain freedoms. Even cranky one-star mental midgits must have their day! <br /> <br />As to the disc itself as previously stated if you enjoyed Rods first three installments then you will probably enjoy the final disc as well. Again, he doesn't stray from that immensely successful formula and while for many thats a blessing it, unfortunatley, is also a small curse. I'll be blunt. Rod Stewart doesn't know the first thing about tackling standards but unlike many musically-challenged detractors I'm perfectly aware of that and am not seeking that when making my purchase. Comparsions with Sinatra ( which some reviewers seem intent on making ) is beyond ludicrous. If I want Sinatra I'll put Frank on my turntable. My reasons for enjoying these cd's is simply because Rod Stewart evidently enjoys these songs, seems to have a grand time singing them and that sense of enjoyment is what comes thru my speakers here at home. If I want pharsing I'll listen to Mel Torme or Ella. If vibrato is what I seek then I got plenty of Sarah Vaughn or Tony Bennett. But asking this singer to be compared with the greats of years before not only shows a complete lack of understanding popular song and also belies any real empathy and understanding of these discs. Trust me, not one of these cd's will ever be considered a \\"classic\\"  but that's hardly the point here. The sheer pleasure, at least from this music lover, comes from hearing a standard, knowing its lyrics and singing along with Rod. Knowing full well that neither of us will ever be considered great vocalists and not caring either. Can anyone here truly believe that Rod the Mod actually subsctibed to the very idea that he's a tremendous vocalist. Of course not! Thats why he's having such a grand time. Its a labor of true love for him and the very fact that fans of these discs are hip to that fact makes it even more enjoyable. And for those out there who only wish to hear him sing \\" Maggie May \\" I suspect nothing that this singer could ever do would eventually please them. <br /> <br />Overall, I take great pleasure in these cds. No, there not perfect, no there far from being considered classics. And no, not one track to be found on any of these offerings would be considered definative but who cares. Its a great disc to throw on, roll back the carpet, sing and dance to and thoroughly enjoy.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|There is just one good track on this album, and it is Precious, which is a new depeche mode classic in the vein of Enjoy the Silence. But even this standout is nearly sunk by an absurd lyric about silver wings. The Depeche Mode rhyming scheme, once so charming, has kind of worn out its welcome.<br /><br />Most of these songs are tuneless. The striving gospel numbers seem forced. The lyrics are laughable pop-psychobabble. The overfiltered and dirtied vocals don't suit the songs half of the time. Not nearly as good as Exciter, which had several good tracks.<br /><br />****EDIT*****<br />After a few years, I see this as a new Depeche Mode with a greater sense of self-humor. I have gained an appreciation for about half of the songs on this album, but I still think it's their weakest.
B000002UA7|5.0|One day I heard at the radio \\"Army dreamers\\" and instantly this song reminded me of \\"Beatrix\\" from Cocteau Twins, I dare to say it's even better than \\"Beatrix\\". I wanted to know more about this Kate Bush, so I bought this album, called \\"The Whole story\\". Boy, I was stunned and this hadn't happen to me since many years! These songs are just haunting, I hear them again and again in my mind long after I have heard them. Her voice is sublime, like coming from another world... What a strange beauty in her words !... She's like nobody else, not even Tori Amos , to whom I see that some people compare her. I adore Tori but this one (Kate Bush) is just so different. I can't compare her to anyone else nor classify her style which is unique.  <br /> <br />I give a five star rating to this album and long to hear to her other albums, to her new album as well, which is called \\"Aerial\\" (Sylvia Plath comes to my mind here with \\"Ariel\\", I wonder if there is a connexion between them).  <br /> <br />My favorite songs from this album, the ones which, in my opinion, stand out are the following : \\"Breathing\\" (one of the best songs by far that I' ve ever heard), \\"Army dreamers\\", \\"Cloudbusting\\", \\"Wuthering heights\\", \\"Running up that hill\\", \\"The Dreaming\\", \\"Hounds of love\\", \\"The Man with the child in his eyes\\", \\"Babooshka\\".  <br /> <br />Finally I would like to indicate to new listenners (like me) the following link which is a great source of information about Kate Bush (including a short biographical note, discography and some very interesting external links):  <br /> <br />[...]%20Bush

B000ASAEQW|5.0|I bought this video recording in VHS format of Mozart's famous singspiel, \\"Die Zauberflote\\" (The Magic Flute) in 1990, and it's the best all around production of Mozart's great opera I've seen.  I believe this is superior to the Levine/Met production from 1991, also on DG DVD.  This is a September 1983 live performance from the Bavarian State Opera, and features Francisco Araiza as Tamino;  Lucia Popp as Pamina;  Wolfgang Brendel as Papageno; Kurt Moll as Sarastro, among others.  I would call this a traditional production, rather like Ancient Egypt seen through the eyes of German intellectuals, unlike the Levine/Met production, which had more contemporary sets and yet had a more \\"Ancient\\" look to it than this Munich production.<br /><br />Conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch (b. 1923) sets sensible tempos in the style of Karl Bohm, although many of Sawallisch's tempos are faster than Bohm's studio recording from 1964 (DG CD).  He is more moderate and middle of the road than Levine, and appeals more to my way of thinking Mozart's great opera should sound. While there are a few imperfections in singing and ensemble, the overall musical thrust is so good, these are quickly cast aside.<br /><br />For more details, see my remarks about the VHS release of this title. I am glad and thankful DG is releasing this on DVD.
0740748475|5.0|As a huge fan of Calvin and Hobbes, this is an absolute must-have.  The smaller collections are far more convenient for casual reading, but to have the entire series in one archival three volume set is awesome.    I have several of the C&H collections dating back to the early 90's along with several of the Bloom County collections from the late 80's.  I've always loved both strips but C&H is always fresh and timely.  100 years from now, the timeless philosophies of C&H will be relevant as the day they were written.  Bloom County - a political piece relies on you to recall the exploits of Ollie North, Madonna, or Imelda Marcos.  As the events of the 80's become more and more distant, I find myself less interested in pulling out Bloom County and more interested in Calvin and Hobbes.
0393324818|5.0|Moneyball is a phenomenal book about the game and business of baseball, but it is also an insightful look, in the context of innovation, into the historical background and institutional framework of baseball along with the traits that made Billy Beane a successful innovator. <br /> <br />Bill James, Sandy Alderson, and Paul Depodesta are just some of the individuals mentioned in this book that deserve credit for their creative ability to see the game in a different light, the light of the scientific method.   <br /> <br />Although Billy didn't have the statistical and formulaic expertise of some of these other individuals, he acted as the creative catalyst in bringing the ideas developed via the scientific method, sabermetrics (the mathematical and statistical analysis of baseball statistics), to fruition i.e. implementing them into the game of professional baseball.   <br /> <br />Billy's experience as a ballplayer plays a crucial role in his willingness to adopt the values of the scientific method.  He is able to come at the problem of ballplayer valuation with a firsthand understanding of why some of the established methods of ballplayer valuation are flawed; His fearlessness of mistakes is another attribute that allows him to innovate so successfully. <br /> <br />I think my favorite segment of the book is the discussion of Billy as a trader; he has an uncanny ability to get what he wants for much less than its worth - part of this is due to his more accurate understanding of the intrinsic worth of baseball players, but much is due to his shrewd negotiating ability and trading techniques.  One technique Billy uses is \\"trawling\\" - the constant search for information critical to other GMs - which helps him to find creative solutions to effectively craft deals that other GMs would find agreeable. <br /> <br />All in all, I greatly enjoyed this book, but I would like to have seen a discussion, possibly just a chapter, devoted to the evolution of the A's model and whether or not other teams would be wise to adopt it.  There is no question in my mind that sabermetrics is an incredibly valuable tool to be utilized by baseball front offices, but chemistry also has its place.  I think a comparison with the model used by the Atlanta Braves' front office, one that does not neglect the value of an analytic approach, but also places emphasis on the value-based/observational approach used by many scouts, would have served this topic well.     <br />

B000AU9UYM|1.0|My God the pain! Let's point out numerous flaws/stupid stuff in the movie: <br /> <br />1. Why are there present interludes when we are watching the past? Why won't Nolan just show the kid Bruce and then the adult Bruce? It's pointless the way he does it. Oh wait I know why; he's a bad film maker. Sad that people mistake this for \\"good film making.\\" <br /> <br />2. The Scarecrow has about 2 seconds, and Ra's Ahl Ghul is so plain and boring. Yeah, this is a BATMAN movie, but come on, what is Batman without his criminals and bad guys? Some dork in a suit who whines and whines and whines... <br /> <br />3. And whines... and whines. Batman is a pansy in this movie. \\"Oh, I fell down a well and some bats scared me. Mommy, help me! I might start wetting the bed again!\\" Too much gibberish about \\"fear\\" too. It's like who cares? <br /> <br />4. No imagination. None. What's the scariest thing Nolan came up with with Scarecrow's gas? FIRE EYES! Bow down to FIRE EYES! Wet your pants in FEAR with FIRE EYES! Or worms... or a skull... I mean instead of putting something that actually scares people (a spider? a scary clown? snakes? etc. etc.) he puts FIRE EYES. All shake and tremble to FIRE EYES! Just watch as Batman glides and what scares the people? FIRE EYES. The movie is also \\"realistic\\" because Nolan can't but IMAGINATION and FANTASY into a FANTASY character. Ya know, making a FANTASY movie about BATMAN is out of the question! <br /> <br />5. The fight scenes... are edited so badly it's crazy! People say this is from the victim's POV... well why was the fight scenes like that when Bats fought Ra's or when Bruce fought the Chinese people in the beginning? Why is Nolan treating ME like a victim (actually, after watching this \\"movie\\" I feel like a victim)? The argument makes no sense. The reason Nolan shot them that way? He sucks. <br /> <br />6. How he got his gadgets... watching these sequences is about as entertaining as watching someone buying groceries at the grocery store -except here you here some idiot keep on making excuses and asking stupid questions like \\"Does it come in black?\\" But then again, this is genius film making! What is more genuis than watching people order stuff from their own company? Best Screenplay/Director/Picture award coming this way! <br /> <br />7. The collateral damage. So Batman who wants to be silent and a dark knight costs about a billion or 2 dollars in property damages, risks cops lives and bystanders. And for what? KATIE HOLMES (who is horrible). That's right. Obviously she is worth more than a dozen cops and property. <br /> <br />8. Closer to the comics? Nope. Not at all. People say \\"Well, the Joker didn't kill Batman's parents!\\" Well, Ra's Ahl Ghul did not train Bruce! John Crane is a teacher! Rachel Dawes does not exist in the comics! If anything, Burton's version is closer, even Bob Kane has admitted that's how he always invisioned Batman. <br /> <br />9. The music is uninspired, with too much synthesizer and drums. Nothing special. No memerable theme like Elfman's score. Fits the movie though; dull, uninteresting, uninspired and boring. <br /> <br />10. Doesn't need to be a Batman film. Replace this with Jerry Orbach and change a few characters names and BAM you have a totally different movie. Hell, you can even keep Ra's and Scarecrow and have a different movie; it's just too realistic. It's like a martial arts episode followed by Law and Order. It just isn't that great. <br /> <br />The good things about the film: <br /> <br />- It ends <br />- It can be used in a suicide note <br />- It makes me want to watch Keaton's Batman to feel better <br />- It gave me a warning to watch it again or its sequel
B00097DXZS|2.0|On previous albums (Supernatural, Shaman) the songs felt like actual collaborations with the artists. On \\"All That I Am\\" (which is a good a joke for a title), the songs feel like the guest artists just recorded their parts and mailed the recording off to Santana's Berkely studio for him to put his recycled guitar licks over. And judging by the credits... that's exactly what happened. <br /> <br />I knew I wasn't getting a Santana album when I bought this. I just liked the guests he brought along on this one. Or should I say, \\"I just like the artists that brought Santana along on this one.\\"?  <br /> <br />I dig Anthony Hamilton a lot, but not even his track is all that great. It seems to me that he really humbled himself and held back to give room for Santana to do something, but sadly, Santana does nothing with that \\"room\\". <br /> <br />I knew nothing about Bo Bice before, but based on his performance here, I feel he's severly over-rated. Maybe it's just not his style? I don't know. <br /> <br />The Joss Stone and Sean Paul track is probably the highlight here. The track is smoldering and Santana actually helps the song out. <br /> <br />I was looking forward so much to the Robert Randolph, Kirk Hammett, Santana track (Trinity)!!! But what's up with that acoustic guitar?!?!?! It sounds like crap!!! It sounds like somebody's playing a tin bucket with strings on it! That stupid acoustic guitar in the background KILLS the song and makes me wanna vomit! <br /> <br />Overall, I could see all of these songs be complete without Santana even being on them... and that's a bad sign. But that statement is just eveidence that these songs are not actually collaborations, but they are just Santana jamming over a finished song that never needed him. Sad, I know. I wanna cry over my own statement there, but it's the truth.
0060825219|2.0|I am a big fan of Paulo Coelho's work. I believe time will show him to be an important writer.  <br /> <br />I first discovered him with \\"Veronica Decides to Die\\" on an airplane flight. It made me want to rush out and do something wonderful with my life, and I've recommended it to friends. Several of his titles are permanent parts of my library. <br /> <br />That said, however, I was frankly disappointed by \\"The Zahir.\\" I don't believe there's the moment of transformation for any main character which we've come to expect from Paulo Coelho. I don't believe there's an adequate exploration of the conflict that gets his tale going in the first place. Things just seem to meander from one place to another until the story fills enough pages to call it a day. I sincerely believe a first time author would have found it difficult to get this published. <br /> <br />Buy the rest of Paulo Coelho's books. Loan them to friends. Keep them in your library so you can read them again and again. But if you really want to read this one, check it out from the public library so that you can return it when you're done.  <br />
B000002KBU|2.0|CARY: The only track with bass & drums. Another additional benefit is the background singing. <br /> <br />CALIFORNIA: This is the one with the steel guitar (at least it's something). <br /> <br />MY OLD MAN: Right after \\"frying pan\\", there's a brief piano passage that sounds like Paul Bowles. <br /> <br />A CASE OF YOU: It's a dud track and my guess is that this non-tune was written around the pre-written lyric.
B000A59PMO|4.0|I am the type of person who absolutely abhors most of the garbage that TV producers put out these days, and have been for a long time now.  I think and believe that 99% of what you see on TV is throwaway, nonsensical, BS, that has no place in your head. <br /> <br />This show is actually very interesting and not just for teens.  I am not a teen, being 30 I actually think its enjoyable, without insulting my intelligence all that much.  I guess what I am saying is that IMHO, this is the most interesting thing I have seen on TV since \\"Twin Peaks\\", back in 89-91.  The characters are well thought out and seem to be really immersed in their parts, not just half-wit acting.  Also, the show has a lot of twists and turns that will keep you pleasently engaged until the final episode is over.     <br /> <br />You might be asking yourself, why if I enjoy this so much am I giving it only 4 stars?  The DVD special features are non-existent, except for a few, mostly unimportant deleted scenes.  No interviews with the cast and story writter, no making of, just the deleted scenes.  I would actually suggest that you rent this through Netflix, or any other online rental place, which is what I did, unless of course you feel you must own it.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|It was a matter of arguement of Dream Thater's new studio album. Last two of their studio album devided the fans all over the world generally in two part; first group is included by the fans who likes ToT and 6DoIT albums and next ones who hate those ToT and 6DoIT. Personally, i coundt love them as their past albums but at the same time i believe their essence has a penetrating difficulty, moreover, if anyone can penetrate once, get lost within them.I listened this \\"OCTAVARIUM\\" with no expectations. An what i've found? \\"Root of Evil\\" is a natural follower of ToT sound. Heavy song but keyboards are more hearable than ToT.Second track \\"Answer Lies Within\\" is one of the best in Octa. slowly processing song. Enterence of strack remind ed me Pink Floyd's \\"High Hopes\\". LaBrie reaches another peak in this. Excellent. Especially in desperate hours, anyone can find his/her all answers lie within.\\"These Walls\\" has very great keyboard and guitar parts. It is a qualified new era Dream Thater track. Be careful for Portoy in the silence parts of the song. Impressive.\\"I Walk Beside You\\" is a song with new experiments on vocal parts for Dream Theater. U2-like vocals are waiting to be liked. Not bad. But nothing more than \\"not bad\\". \\"Panic Attack\\" is a transition song between 6DoIT and ToT.It has only a few \\"Muse\\" like vocals on it.They dont dominate whole. Solos are truely excellent.\\"Never Enough\\" is more \\"Muse\\" sounded track. After 03:30 song gets another vision via Petrucci's guitar tricks. \\"Octavarium\\" is truely a progressive metal masterpiece.Tribute to the progressive rock legends from Dream Theater. A modern Vintage. It has perfectly orchestrated five parts as \\"Someone like him\\", \\"Medicate(awakening)\\", \\"Full Circle\\", \\"Intervals\\", \\"Razor's Edge\\". Total running time is 23 min. Flutes, achoustic guitars, electric guitars, lyrics, drums are all awasome. But keyboards have a spesific \\"peak\\" on this album. All notes have a self meanings. First part is as an enterance and reminded me Pink Floyd's \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\". II.part has a lyric dominated structure till 12:15. After that Marillion/Yes like keyboard tricks and sounds get neo prog fans heads off. Even the end of this part may be given as a lesson is called \\"how to write a prog song in five steps\\". \\"Intervals\\" has unbelievably great transition to the \\"Razor's Edge\\" with most impressive strings. Wonderfull. On \\"Razor's Edge\\"processing of song, compability of strings, harmony, polyphony, sound of guitar solo...I say this without any of suspect, it is one of best songs in prog music history not just DT history. The most matured song of DT maybe. It may take time to understand totally but it woths everything.<br /><br />It is Jordan Rudess, the one getting giant on this album. He has a domination on whole tracks especially \\"Octavarium\\". Ashes of my love for DT got alive again with this.and reminded me Pink Floyd's \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\".

B0000DERO9|4.0|Again the Pet Shop Boys played their little trick on their fans. The album Very was released in 1994, and didn't do very well commercially or critically, and while the Pet Shop Boys shortly thereafter toured, it had the feeling (partly due to the rumour mill) that this was in fact a farewell series of performances. The next year, when the dual-disc set Alternative was released, the question was largely, 'Alternative to what?' -- a real album, a continuation (Alternative was made up of all the non-album b-sides that had been released during the Pet Shop Boys career, once again fueling speculation that this was a tying-up-of-loose-ends at the end of a career).<br /><br />Then, in 1996, the album Bilingual was released, again following the by-then-well-established pattern of releasing a single, then follow-up with the album. This was an 'out' album; while most people always knew the alternative sexuality of the group, it had never been made explicit in the group's official publicity. Now, it had been. No surprise to anyone really (does anything coming from any band from the 80's really surprise anyone?).<br /><br />The Pet Shop Boys managed to release an adequate album, alas, not their best work, and indeed some commentators, remembering the speculation that they were ready to retire, opined that retirement would have been better than this.<br /><br />Not so, to be sure -- this is a perfectly serviceable album, good in many respects; the first single, Before, was released with a CD-movie of the video (very useful for those without Euro-MTV, American MTV long since having left the genre of the Pet Shop Boys behind and thus unlikely to carry their videos even when they win Euro-MTV awards). This song included many of the classic Pet Shop Boys elements -- poppy dance tune, double-edged lyrics, sample heavy feel, and toe-tapping rhythm.<br /><br />The rest of the album is influenced obviously by the groups adventures in Latin America and Latin Europe during their concert tour, as well as holidays in the sun. Songs such as Discoteca and Se a vida &eacute; contain in their titles the influence; peppered throughout with almost spoken lines in Spanish (&iquest;Hay una discoteca por acqui?), almost as if they had simply lifted lines from their Berlitz travel phrase book. But, in the traditional quirky Pet Shop Boys way, these fit in nicely with the tune.<br /><br />The transitions on this album are interesting -- for the first time, the Pet Shop Boys didn't have their songs as isolated bits, but many instead flowed together--Discoteca and Single being two prime examples, which bleed together musically and lyrically, the end of Single being also the first line from Discoteca: (&iquest;Hay una discoteca por acqui?).<br /><br />Songs in the much more traditional upbeat, lyrically-cynical and clever, electronically pop include To step aside, A red letter day, and Saturday night forever. Tennant begins to allow himself some more direct social commentary in songs like The survivors, which can be understood on many levels. Of course, Tennant's lyrics on the album Behaviour poked fun at those celebrities who, because they have fame, suddenly start taking themselves seriously as experts on social concerns, so he is understandably cautious and understated in his own observations, which are usually very much rooted in his own, direct experiences.<br /><br />As with many Pet Shop Boys albums, Bilingual had a follow-up single, Somewhere, which was not included on the album, but was on the special edition, limited release of the double-CD Bilingual. This second disc includes in addition to Somewhere remixes of several of the album cuts, as well as an additional b-side.<br /><br />The songs Before, Single, and A red letter day charted variously around the world, but didn't catch hold and take top honours anywhere. Alas, the Pet Shop Boys looked like they were past it. But history has proven differently.<br /><br />This is an essential album to anyone who wishes a complete Pet Shop Boys collection -- the special album only for those die-hard collectors who can spend extra on auction sites or some such to track it down, but one gains little musically from it. However, this album is for the most part a placeholder in the overall history of the Pet Shop Boys (for the historically inclined, perhaps it is the 'James Polk' of their albums, adequate but undistinguished, often forgotten, but still on the books).one who wishes a complete Pet Shop Boys collection -- the special album only for those die-hard collectors who can spend extra on auction sites or some such to track it down, but one gains little musically from it.

B000A3DFZE|2.0|A few decent tracks such as George Harrison's \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\", however for the most part EC sings to sub standard R&B ballads, which may work for some, but not for slowhand.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|I can see why some people would think this album isn't as good as  the others. These are the people that think Depeche Mode's music has changed too much and they're simply not happy about it and certainly not at all willing to go along with it. Strangely enough, these are the same people that, if DM didn't change their style up a bit, would complain that it's the same old tune recycled over and over on every album. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a much darker DM album than I'm used to, but I liked it more than most others for that reason. The tunes are good, the lyrics (for the most part) are well polished, and it's definitely an album you should give a chance. And if you find it hard to deal with the change of style, give it a few more listens through. Your opinion of it will probably get better. <br /> <br />Standout Tracks: <br />\\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" - This song is obviously influenced by Nine Inch Nails with its loud, raw industrial sound while being very dark lyrically. If it wasn't for the vocals being different, I wouldn't have known the difference. <br /> <br />\\"John the Revelator\\" - Extremely catchy lyrics; I can't get this song out of my head! Luckily, that turned out to be a good thing. <br /> <br />\\"Macro\\" - Powerful lyrics sung with a lot of passion. I couldn't help but loving this song.
B00097DXZS|3.0|Not a bad cd, however it seems that the entire cd is engulfed in Latin music. A few gems include Steven Tyler, Michelle Branch and Bo Bice, however Carlos should focus the album more so on rock n' roll as opposed to an overkill of Latin music.  Save your money folks, this is just not worth new, used maybe, but not new.

B000AL730Y|4.0|There's a lot of buzz for this CD and I think it's a bit of a stretch, although not without truth. Frankly, I was expecting to be blown away. Instead, I was entertained and frequently impressed, but not dazzled. McCartney does often achieve moments of his own past greatness - most of Fine Line, Friends to Go, Jenny Wren and English Tea - but repeatedly slips into more awkward, forced sections that more recall his later, less successful material. There's nothing, in other words, that holds together in perfect form from beginning to end like, say, Fixing a Hole, or, if you go back further, Things We Said Today. That having been said, there is  much to enjoy on this record. McCartney demonstrates consistent mastery of texture; his arrangements, which, as you now know, no doubt, are largely himself playing a multitude of intruments, are unfailingly on the money. The piano often evokes late-Beatles Paul, as does the gorgeous Hofner bass. Use of acoustic guitars is always effective, although he's a bit less consistent with the electrics, sometimes hitting the ground running (Friends to Go), but other times missing the mark (the tacked on piece at the end of Anyway). You sense that Paul is taking his writing - and his legacy - seriously here, no doubt a factor of his entering his middle sixties, having acquired and inspired that lifespan perspective that an artist gets to later in life when the body of work really begins to stretch out behind him - the autumnal seriousness of a songwriter holding onto his still potent powers and apparently relishing their longevity. Still, lyrically he's no Dylan - or even Ray Davies. But the seriousness that pervades much of the material has pulled out some compelling music that I think will age well, as much of his catalog has, come to think of it. The strange thing is - the longer his stuff hangs around in our heads, the more endearing it becomes, mainly because the fact that it's not Beatley enough matters less and less as time goes by. And whereas this one isn't as Beatley as the hype would have you believe, it's quite evident that the artist behind it, while well past his prime, is still predominantly in command of his artistic gifts.    With regard to the DVD, McCartney comes across as himself, a well-developed persona - too much so, maybe - obviously quite at home with the camera and able to deftly use it to suit his purposes. (He's been doing this for a long time!) There was one moment, however, that was priceless for me, where he shared somthing of a more personal nature about one of the songs in a way that will particularly touch fans of George Harrison.
0060234814|4.0|When we read this in for our Book Group it was difficult to find a good list of discussion questions. Here is the list I compiled from questions I found on the internet. I hope this helps your book group! <br /> <br /> <br />1) Many of Narnia's fantastical creatures are personified; name some of them. Which human qualities are most celebrated? Which are not? <br />  <br /> <br />2) Elements of fantasy and real life are intermingled in the worlds of Narnia and \\"reality\\". What makes these worlds different from each other? <br /> <br /> <br />3) Although they are children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have very distinct personalities. By portraying them the way he did, what messages might Lewis have been sending to children about human behavior. <br /> <br /> <br />4) Each of the children undergoes some changes throughout the course of the novel. Discuss how these changes impact their characters.  <br /> <br /> <br />5) Symbolism is quite prevalent in this book. Discuss what Narnia and Aslan symbolize and how their portrayals shape Lewis's message. Who or what else is symbolic? How?  <br /> <br /> <br />6) In agreeing to sacrifice himself in Edmund's place without divulging to the White Witch theat he could return, Aslan might be considered somewhat deceitful. What other variances are there on the traditional definitions of good and evil? <br /> <br /> <br />10) Aslan sternly reminds Peter to cleand his sword after he kills Maugrim. Why was cleaning his sword so important?  <br />7) When Lucy tries to minister to her wounded brother, Aslan hurries her along to tend to others. Does the theme of the greater food vs. the individual arise elsewhere in the story? What other themes arise? <br /> <br /> <br />8) The Pevensie children leave London during World War II because the city they live in is being bombed. Yet Narnia they fought in a war. Do you find this ironic? -Talk about this. <br /> <br /> <br />11) In Chapter 10 the children meet Father Christmas. How is he likethe traditional image of Santa Clause? How is he different? What does he seem to represent? <br /> <br /> <br />9) Notice the titles of Mr. Timnus' books. Do any of them strike you as strange or humorous? Why? <br /> <br /> <br />12) The children are each given a gift by Father Christmas. Whose gift would you most like to have? Which do you think is most useful? Elaborate. <br /> <br /> <br />13) In Chapter 7 the children hear about Aslan for the first time. Describe how each of them feels when they first hear about him. Why do you suppose they react so differently? <br /> <br /> <br />14) Some readers think that there are parallels to the liberation of the stone statues in Chapter 16. They point to passages like Matt. 27: 52-54; Eph. 4:7-10. Do you see any similarities? <br />15) In Chapter 17 the children (as adults) go after the White Stag.  What do you think it represents in the story?  <br /> <br /> <br />16) Do you think it's an accident that the children return to England when they do? Why, or why not? <br /> <br /> <br />17) Discuss the relationship of time in Narnia to the time in the children's world. How does it work for the children to grow into adults in Narnia, then returned to children in England?  <br /> <br /> <br />18) In the beginning the children have trouble with Lucy's claims that she has been to Narnia. What does the Professor say about this? How does he apply logic to this situation? <br /> <br /> <br />19) Throughout the book there is a paradox about Aslan, which the Beavers describe as \\"good and terrible\\". Compare what they say about Aslan with what is said about God in the Bible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />20) Aslan tells Mr. Beaver (p.137) \\"All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about noises. Speculate on what he might mean by this. <br /> <br /> <br />21) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, was written as a children's book. Do you think we, as adults, have something to gain from reading it as well? <br />

0307276902|3.0|Reading James Frey's new book \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" the greatest reward is perhaps uncommon perspective from a truly new voice.  I wouldn't suggest that Frey directly \\"borrows\\" from anyone in his writing, but one might be reminded of the coarseness of Cormac McCarthy's patented writing style and clipped prose, combined with the street view of, say, Lee Stringer, whose novel Grand Central Winter told of a life crawling similarly out of the proverbial gutter, unconvinced that it isn't better just staying down there in the first place.<br /><br />As a fellow author (shameless plug: \\"Las Cruces,\\" July 2005) who tries to also capture and bring forward the feel, and scent, and grit, and sometimes endless complexity of even the most simple of life's decisions (i.e., stay locked in a man made hell, or get out?), I'm always attracted to books such as A Million Little Pieces.  However, as others might point out, sometimes there's only so much reality - especially this kind of reality - that one can take in a single dose, no matter how well told.  Be forewarned, this story is well told, and this novel is a BIG dose.

We all know the outcome - Bush won - Kerry lost - and tons of fun raked in millions. <br /> <br />Thanks Michael for four more years of Bush.  I bet if this film wasn't released, Kerry would be beside himself right now trying to run a war torn country with record natural disasters and very unhappy people. <br /> <br />Now for the movie.  It sucked.  period.  Very predictable and grossly negligent.  Mr. Moore takes advantage of human grief and suffering and exploits it (the American way).  The cover of this DVD, with him wearing a cap with an American flag on it, should warn you about this pathetic film. <br /> <br />Marines were laughed at.  Our President (during a time of War) was mocked and made a fool of and the black youth, people of which Michael claims to be so in touch with, were ridiculed. <br /> <br />America should kick this &*hole out of our country.  We don't need anymore troublemakers - we need solutions.
0192834290|5.0|The sheer brilliance of this story \\"transcends time\\", to beat and old cliche.  People can not resist and good mystery, and this is by far the best.  At the same time, though, the story itself could not have existed in any other time.  Had this scheme of Fosco and Glyde been attempted in the 20th century, Miss Halcome would have picked up the phone within the first three chapters and it would have all been over.  Or, a simple blood test would have cancelled any disbelieve in Lauras identity.  But, minus these technological nuisances we get a story that is brilliant for it's sound complexity.  It is complex, and yet no contrived.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|Don't go into watching this movie with huge expectations, and you may find yourself enjoying it! Its main purpose is to be a fun film to watch, there are some funny parts and some deep parts, but all in all it can't be taken too seriously. It's music is also rather notable. The only things it's lacking is in the realm of believability in the end, that a toxin which had been leaking into the ground, for who knows how many years, could suddenly be a non-issue.<br /><br />So aside from one man's obsession with finding a treasure ship in the middle of the Sahara desert, and aside from some plague or toxin killing people, the movie itself is supposed to be a light hearted action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
0321344758|5.0|I've been working in the web industry for over 5 years now, and pretty much thought I had it all figured out, as far as usability is concerned. <br /> <br />Wow, was I wrong. Reading Krug's book opened up my eyes to several important aspects of web usability that I had overlooked. I especially found the section on user testing useful. <br /> <br />This is one of the best investments you can make for your career!
0393324818|5.0|Let's get one thing straight.  This is not a book about baseball.      America's pastime, they call it.  But to our national psyche it's much, much more.  It's a metaphor for heroism, hope, innocence, youth--the movies don't talk about fields of dreams for nothing.  But dreams are about emotion, and emotions can deceive in cruel and powerful ways.  And nowhere, according to Michael Lewis' intriguing premise in \\"Moneyball\\", does emotion distort with more pernicious force than in the sport of baseball.      Billy Beane found this out the hard way.  As an up and coming minor leaguer in the late 80s he fielded with Dykstra and Strawberry for the Mets.  Mesmerizing baseball scouts nationwide, he found himself heralded as the sport's perfect man, a power hitter, a nimble fielder, a natural headed for greatness with effortless grace.  But after spurning college at Stanford to take the seductive bait of the major league draft, Billy Beane found himself falling a lot faster and deeper than he'd climbed.    Billy was an emotional guy.  His minor league teams spent significant sums on the bats he broke when he struck out, the sinks he pulled out from their moorings when his genius failed. In hindsight, years later, he saw how his own nature had been his undoing.  And he vowed to bend it to his own will, and define for himself a new and spectacular brand of success in the sport that so spurned him.     No author in America was better suited to bring Billy Beane's story to print than Michael Lewis. There's not another writer  at work today with the uncanny ability to bring literary style and journalistic discipline to the world of numbers with such concise and forceful effect.  He showed this talent for fusion in his previous blockbuster, \\"Liar's Poker\\".  But he here he eclipses himself in an investigative masterpiece as informative as it is compelling.    Billy Beane's epiphany about his own failures in the early '90s came in tandem with a radical new school of thought in baseball, one founded in stark statistical analysis, devoid of the trappings of subjectivity and emotion.  As Billy followed a new career path in baseball management these new ideas took firm and deep root in his thinking, and he set out on a course to prove them right.  Let the old school scouts evaluate players based on gut instinct and showy play.  Billy was sure he knew a different way.    Baseball, the chastened Beane began to perceive, was living in the dark ages.  Player were culled, and paid, based on subjective premises that had little to do with their ultimate ability to get on base and score runs. The old fashioned scouting system, rooted as it was in intuition, was rife with inefficiencies and distortions.  With the advent of free agency, the imperfections of the scouting system were magnified without mercy.  In olden times a sub-par player brought up through the scouting system might set a team back 150K.  After free agency, it was more like 15M.     All this did Billy Beane learn, through the prism of his own previous failures.  And where there is inefficiency, as any Wall St. trader will tell you, there is huge opportunity.  A general manager's challenge, Billy's challenge, was to construct a team of professionals stripped down to the barest, and most relevant, essence of their unique individual abilities, with no intrusion from internal doubt or external second guessing. This was the team that would win games, making little boys' dreams come true and a few shrewd men's wallets explode with cash.     The body of \\"Moneyball\\" lays out the tale of Billy's tenure as the general manager of the Oakland A's, guiding the reader through the arcane processes of free agency and the psychology of trading.  But baseball is only a vehicle for the development of much larger themes.  It's man's fundamental struggle in every endeavor he undertakes to strip out emotions from decision making.  The quest for the optimum exists in everything.  But it's an uphill battle, against the way human beings are wired.  Lewis' tale of one man's determination to win, using only the stark truth of mathematical analysis, is filled with countless insights and journalistic jewels.  It's like watching one very exciting baseball game, where the win is about something much more than a game.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember when this show came out on FOX. I was fairly pissed that the network cut Dark Angel for this show and instead didn't give Firefly a bacjward glance. Now, years later, I happen to be perusing around and came upon FireFly again. I noticed the Serenity previews and saw that the characters looked oddly familiar and found them to be of the Firefly series. So in interest, i took a chance, dished out the cash and bought the DVD set. <br />  All i can say is that I'm very impressed and saddened that this show didn't go on as long as it should have. The storylines were mesmerizing, the characters are great, and just the whole 'verse made by Whedon is spectacular! Although I wasnt able to see Serenity while it was out, I already have a pre-order in for the DVD in December.  <br />  All i can say, as a new Browncoat, to all those still deciding whether to purchase this or not - take a chance. Buy the DVD. And before u know it, even you can find peace on Serenity~ <br />  Shame on FOX for canning this rare and wondrous gem for a media world full of monotnous reality tv shows.
B00000637V|5.0|\\"Berlin\\",  which was Reed's follow-up to his highly succesful ( both musically and commercially ) 1972 album \\"Transformer\\", showcases a radical change in Reed's direction. Whereas \\"Transformer\\" was a mostty light and musically catchy album, \\"Berlin\\" is a more complex and darker album; both musically and lyrically.<br /><br />No tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on \\"Transformer\\", and the album contains no new hit-singles. The album works much better to be listened to as a whole, and only few tracks are suited for \\"Best of\\" compilations. Songs like \\"Caroline Says\\" and \\"How Do Think it Feels\\" would be the most obvious selections to put out. This doesn't mean that this is not good album; on the contrary; it may be his artistically most  successful. Musically it's very varied in style and instrumentation.<br /><br />The \\"Berlin\\" theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks; especially \\"Lady Day\\" ( Kurt Weil ).<br /><br />The songs are generally longer than on Reed's two previous albums, but you are never bored when listening to the album; and once you have gotten to know the songs, you'll notice that it is really a very melodic album, with no unimportant tracks.<br /><br />This is Reed's Dark Masterpiece!
B000AL730O|5.0|I was blown away.  The songs are beautiful and touching.  I would highley recommend this CD.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I just saw this movie, rented it over this weekend. Although there might be some slight inconsistencies (I think they squeazed two nights into one long night without pause) the pacing of the story keeps you from worrying about it. The movie takes a more secular or mundane route for explaining the existence of vampires and werewolves. For not being a big budget movie, they did well with what they had. It is a bit bloody, but considering the subject matter it is rather tame, and is handled more cinematically, than graphically.<br /><br />As for the question of what a vampire/werewolf would look like, I think you have to consider he was not in werewolf form when he was bitten and he was given enzymes to keep him from transforming to a werewolf, hence, the form would not be very wolf like until the individual in question could have the enzymes take their course. Remember, that character had never fully transformed into a wolf form, therefore, his structure would not be fully changed.<br /><br />All in all I thought it was a well done movie, and you would never know that it was made with a fraction of the money spent on the Matrix's second movie! I've heard the \\"extended cut\\" is even better.
B000002C25|5.0|Dont go away stand by me are some of the best songs ever. This album is one of the best albums of all time its  definately there best. This band to me is up there with the greatest bands of all time. Bands like the beatles, REM, U2, coldplay, etc. This album rocks.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This new take on Roald Dahl's classic book is a GREAT movie! It is very loyal to the original story and the scenery is outstanding. If you are a Tim Burton fan, you will love this film and will definitely want to own this deluxe-edition dvd. The special features are kind of neat. My daughter is a fan of the \\"Learn to dance like an Oompa-Loompa\\" part. :)<br /><br />While the old movie focused mainly on songs and being cute, this new version really went right along with the book. Don't get me wrong, I like the old movie, but this one is just so much better. I've read the book at least four times now and it is THIS movie that is accurate to the book and that's pretty much why I like it best. Well, that and the fact that Johnny Depp is in it. :)<br /><br />In this movie, the children who are cast as the \\"rotten kids\\" are perfect for their parts and really fit one's mental image of what these kids should look like. The best of these, I'd say, had to be Augustus, who was shoving candy into his face faster than his arms could go. Even my five-year-old was pretty disgusted by him and that's saying a lot, if you've ever seen any of the little boys in her class eat.<br /><br />The only disturbing thing about this movie, however, were the Oompa-Loompas. Yep, there was only one guy playing the part, which was probably the only downfall of the film. The fact that the Oompa-Loompas had a very striking resemblance to my husband's ex-girlfriend was the thing that kinda freaked me out (we both looked at each other when we saw this one in the theater; why was his ex dressed up as an oompa-loompa? It was a strange night).<br /><br />In my opinion, this is Johnny Depp's best performance since \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" and that's saying a lot (I LOVED him as a pirate!). Also, one of the best Tim Burton films to date. If you haven't seen this one yet, the special edition dvd is worth the few extra bucks. You get a lot more features and you'll definitely have a good time enjoying all of the extras!ying all of the extras!
0553801503|4.0|I agree with Tim (Kansas City) that the audiobook is a huge let down.  Roy Dotrice has done an amazing job of developing great voice acting for Martin's characters. His voices are distinct and recognizable. Even with all the characters in the firs 3 books it was always easy to know who was talking because of the animated style Dotrice used.    <br /> <br />When I learned that Dotrice would not be performing the narration for 'Feast' I emailed George RR Martin and asked him why Dotrice was not narrating.  He replied and said that Dotrice simply was not available because of another project. <br /> <br />Needless to say 'Feast' will was a hardcopy read for me.   <br /> <br />A reply to Bushismom (New York)'s comments:  Have you ever wanted to read in while driving or at work? Have your eyes ever gotten tired while reading?  Audiobooks are great in my opinion, and I think you would enjoy this series especially on audiobook. Sometimes it's easier to use your imagination while listening rather than reading words and turning pages.
B000068FWC|5.0|After hearing the three hits, the \\"Logical Song\\" \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", and \\"Take the Long Way Home\\", I was determined to find the rest of the album +Breakfast In America+ After discovering the CD in a music store, I immediately paid for it and plunked that thing down into my CD player at home. From the first track to the last I had made a very wise investment. <br /> <br />1. Gone Hollywood: Most tramp fans don't care for this song but I on the other hand just love it! Starting out with a haunting piano the rest of band blasts in with a story of a person trying to make it big. It has a great sax interlude before it picks back up. The highlight is the ending: \\"when the world is waiting for youuuuuuuuuuu\\" then moving in a nice bridge with only a dual drum roll with the sax taking in the rest of the track 10/10 <br /> <br />2. The Logical Song: I like the lyrics and stuff but I'm not quite sure what's about. Nice keyboards and eletric harpsichord. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Goodbye Stranger: Great song from start to finish. Awesome keyboard. \\"they can laugh at my behavior, that will never bother me and say the devil is my savior and I don't paid no heed\\" Cool hook. Like Gone Hollywood, it ends with a bridge with nice guitar work. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Breakfast in America: Ah the title song. It's kind of an oddball song with the tuba and horns but cool nontheless. Fun bouncy lyrics. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Oh Darling: With a sappy title but really good keyboards and vocals. Nice to sit on a porch swing with person you love and rock in the breaze. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. Take the Long Way Home: Now this is a HIT. With cynical lyrics and the sax showing emphathy, I like to play this song if I had a bad day. Love the sax! and the ending feels like as if someone just turned off the song and let it coast to a stop. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Lord is it Mine: This song begs sympathy from its listener. Nice piano work. It would fit perfectly on +Even in the Quietest Moments+ 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Just a Nervous Wreck: This should be their anthem. Very cynical it's only way. It makes me want to shoot my fist in the air. The hardest rocking song on the album. Great guitar work. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. Casual Conversations: A mellow song about well, I guess having sex. Nice keyboards and percussion 9/10 Sets the stage for the epic ending. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Child of Vision: The best and smartest way to close the album. Starting with the keyboards like Goodbye Stranger it moves on like a sultry drifting spirit with a steady beat. After its short but ironic lyrics about being an alchoholic the auchoustic grand piano takes wins you over into a beautiful bridge going up and down the scale, showing remenants of +Crime of the Century+ and then the sax blasts its way at the nearing end as if it was protesting and puting its own two cents into the music as the song fades away. 15/10 <br /> <br />This is defentaly a place to start if you're new to the band. It is a must have and a time capsual on its own.
B00006AFUR|4.0|First off, I'm not Sherry Oda. I'm her 14 year old son, writing this review. <br /> <br />I became a 30STM fan when a friend of mine sent me \\"Fallen.\\" I instantly fell in love with the song and I decided that I would get the rest of the album. Once I got it, I realised that this band had something to prove. Although not as famous as other bands, their quality is amazing. Good musicians, and good taste. <br />I support this band and I hope that more people will recognize their talent. <br /> <br />Recommended songs off of this album: Capricorn (A Brand New Name), Fallen, Oblivion, Echelon, and The Mission. <br /> <br />Actually, all of the songs on the album rock, but those are my favourite. <br />By the way, if you like this music, you will love A Beautiful Lie, 30STM's new album. I mean it, I like A Beautiful Lie much more than this album, but either way: they rock!
B000002LLC|4.0|I was eight-years-old when the film Dick Tracy was released in 1990.  I didn't initially walk away with much from the film except an indelible impression of Madonna.  I was instantly mesmerized by her image, her voice, and those costumes!  Needless to say, I wanted to look just like her, however, as that was far from possible at eight years of age, I settled on purchasing this album instead.  I bought this album on cassette tape shortly after I saw the film and it became my first Madonna album.  Although I have owned, at one point or another, all of Madonna's CDs, this album still holds a special place in my collection.  The songs are sultry (\\"Sooner Or Later\\"), vulnerable (\\"Something To Remember\\"), naughty (\\"Hanky Panky\\"), and hilarious (\\"I'm Going Bananas\\") all at the same time.  I'm Breathless shows a different side of Madonna, and, as all of the songs are sung in character, an example of her devotion to fully realizing the character of Breathless Mahoney.  Madonna gave Breathless more depth than any of the other actors in the film gave to their respective characters, a difficult task when working with a character derived from a comic book.  This is a great Madonna album even for the uninitiated (hey, if it can be my first Madonna album, it can be yours too!) and belongs in every fan's collection.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  I have been waiting since the last of last season for this to come out on DVD.  My only complaint is that it is not coming out until next year.   I got hooked on this show because of Desparate Housewives and now I like it much better.   The characters are wonderful and I love the comedy on the show. Some of the lines that these actors come out with have you laughing out loud.   <br /> <br />I would definately recomend this DVD!
0553801503|5.0|More violence, more sex, and more mystery make this a very worthy sequel to a Storm of Swords - even if it was not quite as good on the whole as its predecesor. (How can any book be as good as Storm of Swords I ask?) Buy this book, and prepare to be amazed by Martin's world...<br /><br />I will confess that I had a slightly hard time getting into this book, not because the story was poor, but rather that it concerned points of view from \\"new\\" characters that I don't care as much about as say Dany or Tyrion... That being said, once the book got going it more than delivers.<br /><br />Cersei Was by far the best story line in her search to kill \\"The Imp\\", and young Sansa, all the while plotting against everyone who she sees as a threat. (Which for Cersei is almost everyone) Cersei was never one of my favorite characters before, as she was too evil, but now she is right up there with Tyrion. Jamie is hard at work trying to secure the Lannister lands after the Death of his father, and adapting to his new life without his sword-hand. Brienne continues her quests bestowed upon her by Lady Catelyn, with the aid of the Kingslayers blade. She encounters many old friends and foes in her travels. Anya...well she is still \\"Anya underfoot\\" making her way all over Westeros and beyond, avoiding notice, and getting into mischief.  Sam Tarly is sent on a very important Sea voyage by the Lord Snow with the 102 year old Maester Aemon to accompany him...<br />Petyr Baelish is in the Eyrie with Sansa and the sickly Lord Robert, and his intentions are beginning to show that his ambitions are far greater than he has let on...<br /><br />As I mentioned, it was difficult to start the book, as it focuses on the Damphier of Greyjoy and his family, and the people of Dorne. However, I should be clear that looking back, I anticipate a great clash when these nations take a bigger part in the \\"Game of Thrones\\" after all, \\"when you play the game of thrones, either you win, or you die.\\"<br /><br />Relic113
0767816641|5.0|I grew up loving the \\"Madeline\\" books, and as a grown up I enjoyed the film. It had all the charm of the books, translated into today's film format. To my small children this was high drama. To the grownups it was a fun movie. This is one of those whole family films that is so hard to find (ie entertaining to kids without being too stupid for adults to enjoy).

B0000033IR|5.0|Boy, they weren't kidding when Atlantic issued this album originally back in '68. It was a surefire winner from the start. <br />Her third album with Atlantic proved that her talent and gospel vocal style could not be ignored. \\"Chain of Fools\\" does good for the opener. She then cuts out on James Brown's \\"Money Won't Change You\\" with raw vitality, then on the churchy \\"People Get Reday\\". She takes this Impressions' classic and blows the roof off with a great improvisatory gospel vocal spot. Have to listen to see what I mean. \\"Niki Hoeky\\" is indeed catchy; good bass guitar line, too. Then we have the classics \\"Natural Woman\\" and \\"Since You've Been Gone.\\" Listen to that one; it sounds like she sings \\"cinnamon gum\\" every time she sings the title. \\"Good To Me As I Am To You\\" is a bluesy line with Aretha telling it like it is with Eric Clapton doing a good guitar feature. Then she cuts out on Ray Charles' \\"Come Back\\" and peps that one up, and does quite well with the Rascals' \\"Groovin'\\". Finally, we close with \\"Ain't No Way\\"; my personal favorite on the whole album. What a milestone of a song especially with the high wailing soprano in the background which I believe is Cissy Houston. Man, oh, man, that IS soul. Bonus material includes the unedited, longer version of \\"Chain of Fools\\", which is longer by about 2 more minutes. It has a 1 minute intro, an added verse, the lyrics as you're used to hearing them are placed differently. <br />Again, this is the non-chopped up version. Then the mono single versions of \\"Natural Woman\\", \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" and its flip \\"Ain't No Way.\\" If there was any album that made Aretha Franklin a household name, it sure is this. You can believe it. Ever since I got that Atlantic Rhythm & Blues box set, I've been wanting to dig deeper into some of the artists' music. With Aretha, I've heard of the \\"Lady Soul\\" album, and decided to start there. I wasn't let down, and neither will you be.
0553801503|5.0|This was worth the wait, details and layers and subtext and a joy. The characters as usual are drawn in a bold and three dimensional way, and it is a treat to uncover the many clues and red herrings the author offers.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Having seen and loved the original \\"Willy Wonka\\" film I wasn't expecting much from the new version. I was very wrong. Johny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka! This is a real family film which has the perfect ingredients of humour, sadness, lots of jolly music and colour. I could watch it again and again!
B00004YX39|1.0|Anyone who objects to describing this mess as elevator muzak has no defense - the sad fact is that Gaucho is playing in elevators and restrooms around the world at this very moment! <br /> <br />Where to begin? The backup singing is absolutely atrocious, the piano tinkling so lame you find yourself swallowing hard to keep from vomiting, and the list goes on and on. Mark Knopfler was apparently in the studio for one song but the only evidence of it is the song credits. To top it off, this CD finally concludes the series of new liner notes by Becker and Fagen written for the re-mastered discs. Following the trend from the previous CDs, these notes are pretentious, uninformative, and too cute by several orders of magnitude. <br /> <br />Thanks to Aja and Gaucho, few in the late 80's or 90's bothered to wonder where Steely Dan had disappeared to - the concensus was that if this was all they had to offer then thanks for the first five albums and so long - it's been good to know ya.
076790382X|2.0|Others have noted that this is not his best work. I have the audio cassette version and his tone gets in the way of his writing. He sounds both peeved and incredulous at most things American.... like a pissed-off John Malkovich. It's hard to emphasize with his observations since he sounds so superior to the rest of the country in most of his notings. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have noted that his \\"facts\\" are just plain wrong, and I'll add another \\"fact\\" to the pile. He mentions a friend who tries to get temp employment at the Post Office, yet gets turned down because of a drug felony. Why should this person work at a FEDERAL agency? He/she must have lied on the application, right in the section that says \\"Have you ever been convicted?\\" Otherwise, the P.O. would not have bothered running a background check. <br /> <br />Bryson goes on to say that if you are a convicted murderer you'd be able to get a job at the P.O., it's just drug charges they are concerned about. Somehow, I can't see how Bryson could have validated this claim. Does he have another friend who is a convicted murderer who has been able to secure employment at the P.O.? Again, I wouldn't apply at any government job if I had a history of malfeasance. His friend sounds like maybe the drugs did their job too well. <br /> <br />I find myself mentally disagreeing with him as I listen to the book on tape. He could be funny if he weren't so disapproving.
B00097DXZS|5.0|Wow this cd just sounds great. now this is what i call <br />music to my ears. Santana fans who don't have it wut are you waiting for?!??!
0684833395|5.0|Heller is such a talented writer!  This story is funny, shocking, sad, horrifying, confusing, and yet painfully simple.  You just have to read it to understand. <br /> <br />What I appreciate most about Catch 22 is that, while it is entertaining, it is so much more than that.  This novel is a social commentary that explores the atrocities of war, interpersonal relationships, and the depths of the human condition. <br /> <br />Catch 22 is definitely one of my top 10 favorite books.
B00097DXZS|2.0|Yep! Santana comes back yet once more with the SAME formula: lots of big names in the music biz packed in a nice album, with him and his band playing to them. End of formula. Is the album bad? Not by any means, if you isolate it from the rest of his musical production. But if you consider this guy has been putting out significantly more original material in years past, listening to more of this Santana-guitar-sound-accompanying-some-big-name-in-the-music-business is quite dissapointing. Once more, I feel fortunate for having Napster. I wouldn't buy this album, not even for its contagious opening \\"Hermes\\". My advice is simple: skip it. I give it two stars for what it's worth production-wise, but nothing else.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|When I first heard this album I fell in love with it.  But after a month of so of listening, our love affair faded.  Now I can barely ever listen to it.  I would still recommend buying it, but just know that it is not a timeless album.  Arcade Fire is unique and interesting, and hopefully will come out with an album that has the same initial appeal, but something that will constantly keep you interested.  I must add that \\"Crown of Love\\" is beatiful and one song I can still enjoy.

Grey's Anatomy is a smart dramedy with as much wit as it has heart. The only thing more watch-able than the pretty faces are the storylines viewers will love to get tangled up in. <br /> Season one starts out with the introduction of the show's heroin Meredith Grey [Ellen Pompeo] getting herself into a hilariously messy situation (I won't give it away, but let's just say Dr. Derek Shepard [Patrick Dempsey] looks just as good in the morning as he does in his doctor's scrubs). What happens in the first scene of the series sets the story for the rest of the season. Pompeo gives an honest performance (we never feel like she's acting, and we can't help but want her to succeed in her endeavors).  <br /> The show's supporting cast consisting of Sandra Oh paired with Isaiah Washington is one of the show's most pleasant surprises. There is a spark between these two by the second or third episode that viewers will notice (perhaps even before the writers did?) leading one to root for them to get together as well.  <br />Other TV buffs may recognize Katherine Heigl from the now defunct (but equally as great) Roswell. Heigl plays an intern/part time model that is strong willed and intelligent. In season one there are hints of a relationship between her and fellow bad-boy intern, Alex (you may recognize him as Masimo, the goofy Italian guy from the Jennifer Lopez flick \\"The Wedding Planner\\"). Is she just what he needs to show a softer side of himself? <br /> With smart writing and likable characters, this show has the gripping medical dilemmas of \\"ER,\\" the solid camaraderie of \\"Friends,\\" and the heart of \\"Gilmore Girls.\\" Buy season one, and catch season two on ABC, Sunday nights at 10:00 PM.
0553801503|2.0|In my Song of Ice and Fire Experience, I have laughed, loved, and died along with many of the characters. A novel without some of my favorite characters, such as Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, just isn't very compelling when compared to the earlier entries in Martin's series. As a matter of fact, some of my least favorite scenes in the books, while crucial to the plot, involve the story between Jamie and Cersei Lannister. Coming into a Feast for Crows, i was hoping that the storyline would feature Arya Stark as the main focus knowing that Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys would be absent. To my surprise, Mr. Martin has written about some of his least strong characters, and the book suffers this. Like a previous reviewer stated, 300 pages of good writing and 700 pages of fluff do not a good novel make. Hopefully when taken into consideration with book 5, my feelings about the direction this series is taking will change for the better. Until then, all I can do is hope for the best.     By the way, come join me at my website [...] as i tackle my first novel and expound upon the experiences i have with such an undertaking.
0803723865|5.0|The Gruffalo is a delightfully irreverent story about a mouse and an imaginary monster, sure to please grown-ups as well as children.  This is a case where you CAN judge the book by its humorous cover, and you won't be disappointed.  Axel Scheffler's brightly colored and too-silly-to-be-really-scary illustrations set the tone for this light-hearted romp through multiple layers of comic irony;  and Julia Donaldson's marvelous doggerel perfectly realizes the mouse's sprightly character.<br /><br />It's much more than great fun, though.  The Gruffalo also has tremendous resonance with familiar elements of Western culture.  This is a story that Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell all could love.  It's a perfect little Hero's Journey:  it's got \\"the deep dark wood,\\" a confrontation with the Monster Within, and a victorious return to the ordinary world where a nut is good.  Had this been a fable of Aesop, we could expect our hero to be eaten right in the middle, and we would be left with some such lesson as \\"Don't be too clever for your own good.\\"  Instead, our mythical mouse makes his Eternal Return bearing a subtle wisdom that echoes the teachings of the world's greatest mystics.<br /><br />The very structure of the story is classic, reminiscent of the great repetitive folk tales, such as \\"The Three Billy Goats Gruff,\\" \\"The Three Little Pigs,\\" or \\"The Little Red Hen.\\"  The mouse's encounter with a dangerous predator is repeated with slight variation in the wording three times (yes, three times, as in three crows of a cock, three days in the belly of the fish, three temptations under a bo tree...) then, after a dramatic climax, the story works its way back with another set of three variations as the mouse retraces his steps on the path toward the real climax.<br /><br />The Gruffalo's greatest fun for grown-ups comes from its heaps of irony.  First, there's the expectation of an Aesopian fable. That expectation is thwarted.  Second are the characters of the animals: they're all wrong.  The mouse is not meek and fearful;  he's bold and confident, a real smart aleck, in fact.  Then the fierce predators turn out to be wimps.  Not only that, these are the exact animals that always represent intelligence in Western folk literature -- the clever fox -- the wise owl -- the subtle snake.  Here they are all outwitted by the least of animals.  Third is the basic irony of the mouse's meeting with the gruffalo -- maybe the mouse is not so clever, after all.  Fourth, the terrible monster....  Fifth, he went through all that for a nut.  Sixth, that story was a profoundly archetypal tale in goofy rhyme, with cartoon pictures.  Seventh, I actually wrote this review, and you actually read it.  What's next?  Am I going to tell you that Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm is a model for education reform?  (well . . . yes!)<br /><br />Finally, The Gruffalo really is a fun and loveable book.  One of the best for sharing with your kids.g.

B00097DXZS|4.0|Ok, I agree that a lot of the stuff sounds like the previous albums. Also, yes he is always in the background in most of the songs. I like this album A LOT, despite all of that. Did it occur to anyone that maybe this is just how they want it? I don't understand why it's getting slammed so much. My thing is Santana is one of the few people who can pull off performing with practically ANYBODY! Some songs on here are better than others such as \\"Twisted\\" by Anthony Hamilton and \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" by Sean Paul and Joss Stone. The other songs may not be the best, but I certainly don't think they are mediocre. Please, listen to the album yourself and garner your own opinion befor reading a lot of other's.
0790729407|5.0|Ireland was in fact NOT a colony. Irish voters were six times over represented in the British Houses of Parliament. A colony cannot vote in home elections. The IRA were a separatist movement who were an offshoot of the IRB - puppets of the Catholic Nationalist movement created effectively by the Irish Catholic church. <br /> <br />The film \\"Michael Collins\\" was in fact a an exercise in propaganda. The IRA were armed by Kaiser Wilhelm with money collected in the united states. $11M to buy guns collected by <br />DeValera - a U.S. citizen. The home rule bill for Ireland was aleady passed so effectively home rule would have occurred immediately following the end of the great war. Redmonds <br />Irish Parliamentary party represented the nationalist element and following the IRA's taking of power (the biggest mistake <br />of any British government) 140,000 protestants were driven from their homes. The result being the escalation of antipathy and the permanent partition of Ireland. The architects of Irish Nationalism were in fact the Catholic Church. <br /> <br />The Collins film also insinuated that \\"they would be sent to the Somme\\". Conscription didnt happen in Ireland - so that was another misrepresentation. To the Irish soldiers of the British Army who volunteered to fight for the liberty of Europe this film was a massive insult. Padraig Pearse was in fact preparing to put Kaiser Wilhelms nephew on a throne and proclaim him King of Ireland; draw your own conclusion as to what they intended to be the outcome of WWI. <br /> <br />The Home Rulers were democratically represented and Collins was a terrorist. No doubt about it. You go into  someones home and blown their brains out when they are not armed its murder. No amount of re-writing of history can say he wasnt a terrorist and they then caused a civil war and plunged Ireland into the dark ages until DeValeras death. DeValera was also the man who sent his condolences on the Death of Adolf Hitler. Again draw your own conclusions. If thats not the actions of twisted fanatics what is. <br /> <br />Good film otherwise but please digest with a large pinch <br />of salt. Good acting and brilliant performances all round <br />- except of course Julia Robertson who needed some <br />coaching with her accent. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Wow.  I finally got to see Advent Children, and I stayed up till 3:00 AM, watching it a couple times [sometimes you need to watch a movie more than once to get it].  I was amazed with the CG, which is a major part of this movie, as well as the score.  \\"Promised Land\\" and \\"One-Winged Angel\\" sounded amazing... <br /> <br />You basically see everyone from the original game, plus four new characters (Kadaj, Loz, Yazoo, Denzel).  Everyone gets a new outfit, except for Vincent, whose only change is that his fingerless gloves now have fingers, and Sephiroth, who had no change whatsoever.  He has nice legs, though....XD!  Cid wasn't seen with a cigarette either....hm. <br /> <br />I like the fact that you still don't really know who Cloud is going to end up with, because the movie showed that he still was slightly hung up over Aerith's death, and that he and Tifa are still best friends.  (They seem better as friends, to me....) <br /> <br />Overall, this movie was fantastic, the voices (Japanese, so far) were perfect for each characters, though Tifa's was a little too high for my taste, but oh well.  ^__^ <br /> <br />Too bad the \\"helping characters\\" [Cid, Barret, Yuffie, Red XIII and Cait Sith] didn't get more screentime...
B00006RU5B|5.0|I admit I was skeptical.  I loved Soundgarden and I loved Rage Against the Machine, but I couldn't figure out how this combo was going to work.  But it does.  Cochise starts this album off with a bang - a song that grips you and doesn't let go and Chris shows that his vocals are as good as ever.  The man is amazing.  The album is consistent with fantastic rockers and beautiful ballads - Like a Stone and Get away Car.   <br />I have played this over and over for years now and never tire of it.   <br />
B000002JSN|5.0|This is my first review but I feel compelled here.  If your just looking for Kashmir or the next Stairway then I'd suggest purchasing one of the greatest hits type albums offered.  If you're looking for an in depth look at the different facets that made this band who they are then this is a great album.  As a musician myself I find this album terribly under appreciated.  The instrumental guitar work on Bron-y-aur may be the most beautiful solo of any kind I've ever heard and remains my favorite track on any Zep album...but that's me.  Some have called it boring or filler...I call it genius.  It's not a straight forward album.  Disc 2 is more of a collection of B-sides they decided to release not so much as part of an album but to give the fans a little bit more.  Ten Years Gone and In The Light are 2 of their best songs.  Boogie with Stu sounds just like its named.  It's a boogie song with a western upbeat piano line.  Sounds fun coming from the bottle of a whiskey bottle on a good night.  As a blues fan Black Country Woman is a favorite as well.  Its grown on me over the years, but now I just love it.  It's rootsy and wooden.  Simple and raw, sitting outside and jamming out some upbeat blues.  These are just of the few I think many here missed the mark on.  Tough to say but this may be the best Zep album simply BECAUSE OF THE 2nd DISC!!! <br /> <br />I rarely even listen to the  first disc anymore...It's played on the radio enough.  If you want the Zeppelin you're not tired of thanks to the classic rock stations put in disc 2.
B000AMPZGC|4.0|The CORPSE BRIDE score by Danny Elfman is a very nice score and brings good songs too, but it could be a lot better on my opinion. Some of the tracks seem to have been sucked out of previous works from this talented and gifted composer, although the final result is quite reasonable. The score has a great opening track. I recommend the CD to all, but be aware not to expect something inovative.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Are you kidding me?   <br /> <br />First off, Radiohead was their INSPIRATION... <br /> <br />and second off, Muse doesnt even like Radiohead anymore. <br /> <br />All you people who just dispise Muse because they are \\"imitating Radiohead\\"... you can all go die... <br /> <br />I'm serious...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Serenity\\" is at once a fitting ending AND a promising beginning. <br /> <br />After creator Joss Whedon's beloved cult show (\\"Firefly\\") was cancelled after an all too brief run in 2002, one had to wonder if this was yet another in a long line of GREAT shows that the Fox network didn't give a chance to, or quite understand (they played the episodes out of order because they felt the 2nd episode of the series was faster paced and more appealing) and cancelled far, far too early, while recycled crap remains on the network 7 nights a week. <br /> <br />The network had to have realized a mistake had been made once the show came onto DVD and quickly became one of the better selling DVDs in history. However it happened, we can be glad Whedon was allowed his chance to (at the very least) wrap up no less than six dangling plot-lines at the shows cancellation. <br /> <br />Fans spent years (or in my case four or five months after I bought the series on DVD after I saw the films first trailer and was blown away) waiting to see how things would turn out for fugitive/lab-rat River and her brother Simon who risked everything, including a successful and prominent life in medicine, to save River from the government who was hurting her. <br /> <br />We wanted to know what was up with Inara leaving the crew, and why she and Captain Reynolds couldn't just admit they liked one another and get it on. What's with the Reavers? and how did they get that way? Would Jayne cause more problems and go back on his promise to Mal to remain loyal to him and the crew, or would he find another way to try and turn River and Simon in for cash? Why couldn't Simon return Kaylee's repeated advances? <br /> <br />My only fear going into the film was that it would ignore the 14 episode series and play as a stand alone. I was thankfully dead wrong. <br /> <br />The movie functions best to its target audience; the fans of \\"Firefly\\". A newcomer may still enjoy the movie very much, but would in all likely-hood be somewhat lost when the film takes time to wrap up the plot-lines I mentioned earlier. The best example is the small, but quite nice subplot in the movie that deals with Simon and Kaylee. It plays quite humorously and poignantly in and of itself, but has a bigger affect when you've earned that moment in the end when they end up together. In fact, I was somewhat surprised Kaylee ended up being the movie's most entertaining character. <br /> <br />The biggest reason to see and enjoy the show before watching the movie is newcomers didn't seem to get why it mattered so much when certain people were killed off in the movie, and basically didn't care (I know this after a few friends and co-workers saw the movie, haven't not seen the series, and expressed as much to me afterward). So, as a result, a lot of the movie's final act is lost on them. I won't divulge which 2 major characters pass on during the movie, but I will say that the first was more or less expected because of the way the film was set up. However, the second death comes as a total shock. <br /> <br />In the end, \\"Serenity\\" is a fantastic sci-fi film with great effects and action. The witty, yet smart dialogue of Whedon is again a trademark of the film like the series. Afterwards I felt like the movie had began a few weeks after the last episode of the show, and had wrapped up all the plotlines nicely. Basically, it was the kick-ass series finale the Fox network never allowed them to have. It also sets up some new dynamics within the crew, and leaves the door open for a promising film franchise. <br /> <br />We can only hope, the studio is smarter than the network, and allows a sequel to occur. <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|The album is absolutley stunning. Music for the heavens. It has a few under achieving tracks , but the're by no means bad, and help make the brilliance that is 'OK Computer'. You guessed it - 5 STARS!  <br /> <br />I think in 2035 this album will be regarded as the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" is now.  <br />A spectacular timeless piece of music, and a perfect mirror (or witness?) of its time.  <br />What more can be asked from a \\"pop\\" album?  <br />
B0001M3MZ2|4.0|I love the show, and the episodes are great.  I highly recommend getting the DVDs, but I don't recommend buying THIS set.  Have you noticed that if you buy Season One and Season Two SEPERATELY, as opposed to both together in this set, YOU SAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY?  Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
B00097DXZS|4.0|All That I Am is a good CD, you can play it all the way through and enjoy it, but there are no BIG hits hear. I would give it a three but I love Carlos' Guitar work so much I had to up it to a four. Its a sounds like album, Hermes sounds like Jungo, I'm Feeling You with Michele Branch a good song, sounds pretty much like there last effort together. You will get the picture, it sounds like older stuff Santana has already done, but still its not bad and I like it. I think the best song on the album is I Don't want to Lose your Love with the Los Lonely Boys, its well done. The Bo Vice collaboration Brown Skin Girl is OK, I think Bo can sing out bigger then he did on this one. I hear that Carlos is going to do a song with Andrea Bocelli and I think that is a great idea, that will be different for sure. In closing, if your a Santana fan get this CD, you will like it, just don;t expect it to be a classic.<br /><br />For PC users; Don't load this CD into your computer until you get the security patch from Microsoft
B000001FTD|5.0|Just before I got this album, I'd picked up the \\"I'm the Man\\" EP...I have a bit on that elsewhere.  I'd heard of 'em, but the band still kind of eluded my understanding until I picked up the record of \\"Among the Living\\" (yes, the vinyl version) when it hit the stores. <br /> <br />This album is considered by many to be their finest, or at least as such in the Joey Belladonna era--a number of the tracks remain live standards.  \\"Caught In a Mosh,\\" \\"I Am The Law\\" and \\"Efilnikufesin\\" are that fine line between thrash and the more melodic sound that was to come in later years. <br /> <br />\\"Indians\\" of course was based a great deal on the suffering Native Americans took across history, but there's nothing funny about Anthrax tackling the subject.  The groove that Frankie Bello and Charlie Benante fix here is the same as any other time...just plain solid, and Scott Ian's multi-tracked guitar riffs are tight as always.  <br /> <br />I liked Belladonna as a singer, though it is obvious his range and style are very different from Neil Turban or Jon Bush.  Either way, a fantastic recording that got many plays on the turntable (and later the CD). <br />
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|What a dour film!  No likeable characters, no smiles or laughs, nothing good going on - and no real emotion to keep the viewer hooked.  Who'd want to watch a bunch of miserable guys living miserable lives?  Add to that the bizarre ending and pointless sub-plot with Kevin Bacon's wife and what you've got, in my opinion, is a real turkey of a movie.  But I bet not everyone will agree...
B00005B36H|3.0|This is the first Tool disc I've heard and bought it because many reviewers proclaim this to be a progressive masterpiece. This is a good disc but far from a masterpiece or progressive, it is more in the nu-metal style.      Pros: The drummer grounds the band with very intriguing syncopated beats that groove well with the bass player. The guitarist plays only what is needed, the singer is decent and the engineering is good. Song highlights: \\"The Grudge\\", \\"Parabola\\", \\"Ticks & Leeches\\" and the title track.    Cons: There is too much noodling and many of the songs are quite monotonous, for example, \\"Reflection\\" clocks in at 11:07 with nothing more than a trance-like repetitive groove/bass line played over and over... granted the dynamics increase but the tune never develops. The disc at 78:50 is way too long and could have been trimmed down to 50 minutes easily. By writing a less than four-star review of this disc I'm sure to receive many \\"not helpful\\" votes.
B000025XKM|5.0|Simply put, this is some of the most intimate and haunting music I've ever heard in my life. It is also one of my favorite albums of all time. I had read an article in 1990 which mentioned one of Nick Drake's songs and piqued my interest in his music. For some reason his name stuck in my head for a few years even though I wasn't able to find any of his CD's in stores at the time. I found \\"Pink Moon\\" in a store in 1995 and bought it immediately, excited that I finally found something by Nick Drake. This CD runs about a half hour, and the night that I bought it I literally listened to this album at least 6 or 7 times for what ended up being hours. I just couldn't get over it; his voice so hushed yet so expressive, the otherwordly tunings on his guitar, the impressive and powerful finger picking style evident on each song...it still amazes me today. I really believed at the time (and was probably right) that this was one of the best kept secrets in music, and until the Volkswagon commercial which featured the song \\"Pink Moon\\", it was. Nick Drake had struggled with mental illness and depression in the years preceding this release and the lyrics, desperate and depressing as they can be, give an insight into his mind that apparently no one close to him was able to achieve. The surprise is that the end of the album features the more optimistic \\"From The Morning\\", which Nick's parents chose to quote on his gravestone. \\"Pink Moon\\", an introspective, all acoustic album with no instrumental backing aside from a brief piano solo in the title track, didn't help Drake's already suffering record sales, and his depression increased until his death from an overdose of anti-depressants in 1974. His biography made me more aware of why this album didn't sell more copies until recently, explaining that with bands like Roxy Music dominating the airwaves at the time, \\"Pink Moon\\" was not exactly going to take the world by storm and seemed decidedly uncommercial. The fact that this was Nick Drake's final album (out of only three he released) is a sad fact, but thank God this was made. My CD collection is nearing 2,000 and this album has remained one of my top five favorites for the past ten years. Definitely a \\"desert island\\" disc.Drake's final album (out of only three he released) is a sad fact, but thank God this was made.

B000001E2W|4.0|This low-priced live CD was obviously Island's method of squeezing one more album (and a few extra bucks) out of Anthrax after they'd moved on.  At least they had the decency to get tracks from some different venues. <br /> <br />Essentially, this sounds like Anthrax, up to the early 90's and you can feel the heat of some of these tunes, same way you would if you saw them.  \\"Efilnikufesin,\\" \\"Keep It In The Family\\" and \\"Indians\\" are all good, and the cover of \\"Parasite\\" was a welcome surprise, being they and I were KISS fans from way back. <br /> <br />The track I really wanted was the duet with Public Enemy on \\"Bring the Noise.\\"  Chuck D. called those shows with Anthrax as some of the hardest, and the collaboration was awesome, especially this live one.  Also like the tracks culled from a show before a radio audience at the end.  Good stuff. <br /> <br />Yeah, a bit of a rip, I suppose, but at least these were good live tracks.  Perhaps not definitive, but alright for me. <br />  <br />
0786715103|5.0|Gen (ret) Romeo Dallaire's account of the Rwandan genocide is a searing, brutal picture of a nation descending into madness while world leaders provided a veritable orchestra fiddling along as accompaniment.  The depiction of human beings reduced to tribalistic savagery will wound the reader.  The depiction of the United Nations and various national governments refusing to do anything to stop the killing and save 800,000 human beings from rape, murder and atrocity will fester that wound into anger.   <br /> <br />It may or may not be true, as Dallaire states, that a handful of troops from credible, western militaries could have stopped the bloodshed, or halted it before it started.  But one can only feel disgust for the national governments and the United Nations that found complete inaction to be preferable to trying. <br /> <br />Dallaire is very even handed in his criticism of various figures involved in the massacre, and does not shy away from self-criticism in the process.  Various national governments, the US among them, garner their share of criticism.  France perhaps earns a special status as the nation who did intervene militarily . . . to defend the genocidaires, not to stop them.  Belgium, likewise, earns scorn from Dallaire for pulling out their troops, the only high-quality, western military force at Dallaire's disposal as the genocide was beginning.  Left with a token force made up of troops from other African nations (which Dallaire thinks highly of) and Bangladesh (whose forces were essentially rented to the UN and deployed without modern equipment, training, or credible leadership), any chance of the UN troops already on the ground doing anything to slow or halt the killing was stillborn the moment the Belgian contingent took casualties. <br /> <br />The United Nations bureaucracy, and Kofi Annan specifically, also earn well deserved criticism in the book.  Annan being notable for ordering Dallaire to turn over informants reporting the impending genocide to the Rwandan government (where, judging from subsequent events, they would surely have been murdered along with 800,000 fellow citizens) because the UN had to maintain moral equivalence between the two sides in the Rwandan civil war.  Annan continued to maintain this viewpoint even as one faction was hacking civilian non-combatants to death with machetes.  The idea that the man who had Rwanda and Srebenica go down on his watch would then be promoted to the Secretary Generalship is a mind-boggling issue that Dallaire does not delve into. <br /> <br />All in all an excellent read, and highly recommended.
0790742780|5.0|After a bad day at work, from time to time I just put this in the DVD player and skip everything except the confrontations between Bill Foster (aka \\"D-fens\\"), a man who snaps for reasons revealed to us as the movie progresses, and the people who get on his bad side.  Abandoning his car in gridlock traffic, he marches across LA like a video game character, acquiring weapons and unleashing them on troublesome modern stereotypes all along the way.  His destination:  his daughter's birthday party (without an invite from his ex-wife).   <br /> <br />Foster's anachronistic appearance (a nerdy, bespectacled engineer complete with white shirt and pocket protector) match his plight--the once powerful white American working man who can't move into the present and accept the changes that have taken away his power and control of the world around him.  Not that he is a racist.  He makes that clear during his confrontation with a real one.   <br /> <br />Prendergast (the cop who is on the trail of D-fens), his basketcase of a wife, and his fellow cops are a complete annoyance, especially his ex-partner who's constantly trying to get him to jump into the sack with her.   <br /> <br />Foster's ex-wife's unsympathetic telephone needling and admission to the police that he never actually hit her lead one to suspect there are two sides to their story and he has not entirely deserved losing his daughter.      <br /> <br />The confrontation scenes are a bit contrived, never allowing anyone to intrude and interrupt or disrupt D-Fens's righteous speeches and violent actions against his antagonists.  The scene where he walks away from a carload of dead and dying punks after they've crashed their car trying to do a drive-by on him looks like he's walking off of a set because the girlfriend of one of the punks waits patiently on the curb until D-fens leaves before rushing up to the car hysterically. <br /> <br />The one person Foster encounters during his sojourn that I liked is the sarcastically sweet waitress at the Whammy Burger.  She's the only one behind the counter who doesn't lose her cool when D-fens pulls out the AK-47 or whatever it is because they won't serve him breakfast.  He certainly isn't the average jerky customer, and she's going to enjoy the moment, especially watching her idiot boss squirm as he is forced to deal with the situation.  She seems fascinated with D-fens, almost like she'd run away and join him on his rampage if he asked her to. <br /> <br />D-fens' only purely heroic act of the day is bashing in the face of the jerk yelling at the woman for cutting him off in the gridlocked traffic.  He probably killed him.  That's one I have to watch over and over again.  So's the scene where he cuts the phone booth to ribbons with the machine gun because the impatient jerk behind him mouths off at him for taking too long to finish using it.  Yes, I get a load of vicarious thrills out of watching this film, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.   <br /> <br />The darkly hilarious scene where D-fens makes an old fart at the golf course regret not letting him walk through the fairway makes this my favorite golf movie.  I would gladly watch a four hour version of this film if D-fens spent all the additional time wreaking havoc and spreading panic all over the golf course, slipping a 4-iron and a pitching wedge into his bag of weapons, and climbing back over the fence, leaving the course to its onslaught of police helicopters, SWAT teams, ambulances and fire trucks.   <br /> <br />Having far passed the point of no return by the end of the film, D-fens realizes he has lost the game and makes his most sensible decision of the day.   <br /> <br />I would love to have seen a series of these movies.  \\"Falling Down 2,\\" etc.  Just imagine how much fun D-fens could have while paying a Middle Eastern convenience store clerk $3.00 a gallon to (in his mind at least) subsidize terrorism, or shaking down a roofing crew for green cards and work visas.  <br /> <br />
B00006GO9Q|5.0|This is my favorite Miles Davis CD next to Bitches Brew and captures Miles Davis in the early stages of inventing what would become known as fusion. He retained several of the players from his previous quintet (Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter) but also added some different instrumentalists to create this music. The songs on this one are like one extended piece and Miles' solos are restrained; this disc is a great example of his saying that what you don't play is as important as what you do. Wayne Shorter really shines here too. The only thing that disappoints me about this one is that Tony Williams (who was capable of the most incredible drumming I've ever heard) was relegated to playing the same pattern on his hi-hat for pretty much the entire album. Aside from this small complaint, \\"In A Silent Way\\" really is amazing and doesn't sound dated like a lot of fusion era jazz does today. The last few minutes are really funky and its interesting to see the riff that the band jams on developing for a few minutes before the band really breaks into it. Highly recommended for any fan of fusion or jazz.
076781214X|5.0|There is irony here; Peggy Sue goes back, but so do you.  Remember we are in 2005, and this Eigthies' movie had turned itself into a classic, a classical Coppola's movie. I love his yellows, his browns, his dim lighted ambiance.  And above all: Kathleen Turner's eyes, hair and her voice, her warm sounding voice.  You can also learn about family relationships and values back into the late Fifties or 1960 and some scenes are memorable: at her parent's house, and the scene with the grandparents, touching!  If you also want to see a blond (and young) Nick Cage, Sofia Coppola as a kid sister, Helen Hunt as Peggy Sue's daughter and Jim Carrey in some school cafeteria scenes this is the movie.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|Having been a Death Cab fan for a few years now, it was with great curiosity that I purchased Plans.  I enjoyed their earlier CDs, and Transatlanticism was an outstanding CD (in my estimation), but I was curious as to how they would sound in their major-label debut with Atlantic.<br /><br />The result?  A musical masterpiece.  The tracks Soul Meets Body and Crooked Teeth have what it takes to be modern rock hits; Soul Meets Body has already ascended into Billboard's Top 10 on the Modern Rock chart as of this writing.  Some might use the word \\"sellout\\" in a blind arrogance, but I perceive it as a great band finally receiving their just due from the mainstream radio industry.  Moreover, they've stayed true to their tradition of long song titles, which is generally seen as a no-no in the U.S. music scene.  Ask the Manic Street Preachers about how that problem can go.<br /><br />The songwriting on this disc is outstanding, with so many songs having lines that jump out at you, almost like how lyrics by Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows come to life.  Not to compare the two bands, but from a songwriting standpoint, DCFC is approaching that rarified air of songwriting excellence.  I don't write those words lightly.  Two examples:<br /><br />1. Crooked Teeth: \\"I'm a war of head versus heart, and it's always this way...\\"<br /><br />2. What Sarah Said: \\"Memories depend on a faulty camera in our minds...\\"<br /><br />The production of this disc is outstanding.  Great mixing, smart instrument placement decisions (such as allowing the piano solo toward the very end of What Sarah Said), and overall a crisp, vibrant sound that accentuates the band's broad musical range.<br /><br />I give this CD my highest possible recommendation.  Longtime DCFC fans should enjoy it, and newcomers to their music who have only heard the single on the radio should know that they're buying a great CD, not a disc with one single surrounded by fluff.  No, it doesn't sound exactly like older Death Cab releases, but that is what happens with bands which grow and evolve.  In this case, the evolution of Death Cab is a positive one, culminating to this point with what I consider to be the best CD that I've heard in 2005.ab releases, but that is what happens with bands which grow and evolve.

0060764899|5.0|This is probably my favorite book in the Narnia series, because I did read it first in the series as a child and it stuck with me.  What always gets me, for some reason, is when the character Edmund indulges in some enchanted Turkish Delight.  One of my favorite parts in the book, maybe because of my sweet tooth. <br />This novel features Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they go through a magic wardrobe and enter Narnia, caught in an eternal frost.  The children in turn encounter fauns, a witch as icy as the environment she has created, and a golden lion, not to mention talking beavers, giants, and Father Christmas.  Edmund learns important lessons in the ethics of betrayal, or lack thereof, so to speak.  Peter, Susan, and Lucy all find courage within themselves through battle and the wise words of Aslan, the golden lion. <br />The Christian allegory in this book is somewhat stronger than in the others, due to the death and resurrection of Aslan, but as a semi-Kabbalist/former Christian/former semi-Wiccan, I have to say I do know about religion and this scence is more magic at work than the power of a god or gods.  So, whatever religion you are, just be open-minded while reading this novel, and I think you will be able to see it for the extraordinarily crafted fantasy it truly is. <br />See you after I read the next novel, for those following my review trail !
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I pre-ordered this DVD and Amazon delivered it on the same day it was officially released. Anyone who could find any flaws in the music, playlist, energy or production must not understand REAL MUSIC! They apparently only listen to hippity hop, rap or grung. I have over 100 DVD concerts and this one is securely in the top five. When the Grammys begin this DVD/CD will walk with every award in their class as well as \\"Best of all for 2005.\\"<br /><br />I can only pity those people who gave out 1s, 2s & 3s. The pity is for their neighbors who have to listen to the sounds that comes from their homes/apartments.<br /><br />By far the best DVD to be released since, \\"Music For Montserrat\\" which featured all of the best musicians and singers in 1997 (was released on DVD July 27, 2004). There have been many that are great between those years, but in my eyes Cream 2005 Reunion is second to none.<br /><br />They were great in 1966 and all have improved dramatically. The surround mix is fantastic as is the editing. My advice is if you are under 40 you may want to skip this one unless you were fortunate to have family expose you to the best trio to ever light up a stage.

I know that a lot of people who didn't necessarily like \\"musicals\\" before are more interested in them today because of episodes of Buffy like this one, and Moulin Rouge.

B0002XNT0I|4.0|In my opinion, Philadelphia will live throughout film history as a movie more honored for its intentions than its artistic merit. Stellar performances by Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington stand along side a rather inept script penned by Ron Nyswaner.<br /><br />The central conflict of the story pivots around an utterly transparent act of sabotage. The filmmakers have attempted to make a tense courtroom drama, yet the defense doesn't really have a leg to stand on. Also, Washington's homophobic/AIDSphobic lawyer has a complete change of heart concerning taking the case but the turnaround is devoid of believable motivation.<br /><br />Still, it was major step forward for mainstream gay films and the consistently fine acting by the leads and the supporting cast, (Jason Robards is riveting,) makes this film well worth seeing.<br /><br />ABOUT THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY DVD: Justice has finally been served --- sort of. Demme originally shot a scene in which Banderas and Hanks were seen talking in bed. The scene was cut for fear of \\"alienating the audience\\" but the decision sparked controversy. The 10th Anniversary DVD edition includes this scene in its extras section. Although the scene should have remained in the theatrical version, at least DVD viewers can now see the longtime \\"married\\" couple actually acting like a longtime married couple.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|D12 is the best band in the world. (g unit number 2, cuz they are too much focused on 50 cent) <br />Loved this album, one of the best. But miss that \\"Devils Night\\" style. <br /> <br />1. Git up: 5/5, the beat is just smashing and the lyrics too. The Swift part gets the credit. Great song to start with, but clip wasn't so good. This is d12 style. <br />2. Loyalty: 4/5, great start, good beat and lyrics. but the song is too long.  <br />3. Just like U: 4.2/5 Somehow i like this song, cuz i think it's funny (on a sick way). <br />4. I'll be damned: 3.5/5 only the chorus did i like and the start. <br />6. My band: 5/5 funny song and clip. <br />7. U R the one: 3/5 didn't like the beat. (funny videoclip though)  <br />8. 6 in the morning: 3.5/5 didn't like it. <br />9. How come: 5/5 the beat is good and the lyrics too. <br />10. Leave that boy alone: 1/5 worst song of the album, i hate the beat. Album could be better without it. <br />11. Get my gun: 4.5/5 it's funny, loved the bizarre part. <br />13. Bitch: 4.8/5 a good song for da club, for the girls. <br />15. D12 world: 4.8/5 almost as funny as My band and a good effort, without eminem. <br />16. 40 oz. 5/5 i think this is the best song of the album. The beat is smashing (with good bass), the proof part is my favorite, then eminem, bizarre and then kuniva (they all good, though). <br />18. American Psycho II: 4/5 first one was better, bizarre crossed the line here. <br />20. good die young: 5/5 for once d12 is being sirius, R.I.P. Bugz (he was good). <br />21. Keep talkin: 4/5 It's alright, but could be better. <br /> <br />I recommend D12 world to y'all
B000BGR0OM|5.0|All single-disc greatest hits albums by bands with as deep a catalog as Eurythmics must leave some great songs off, and this one is no exception.  The songs were chosen based on their success as European singles, and represent rather well their chart success through the Eighties.  I personally find \\"Revenge\\" to be one of the weaker albums, so I disagree with representing it with 4 songs, which necessitates exclusion of material from \\"In the Garden\\" and \\"We Two Are One.\\"  As a single disc greatest hits already exists for the band, it would have been nice to have a double-disc set that also included strong tracks such as \\"The Walk\\" and \\"Beethoven\\" and \\"Don't Ask Me Why,\\" among others.    But let's focus on what is here.  The first track, \\"I've got a life\\" is a 4-minute summary of the Eurythmics' career, starting with a stripped-back, plaintive sound reminiscent of \\"Bare,\\" and ramping up to an all-out techno-disco number reminiscent of \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" synthesized bells and all.  It is truly one of their great singles, and does not come off at all as a half-hearted attempt at something new.  The other new track offered, \\"Was it just another love affair,\\" is a solid ballad.    After \\"I've Got a Life,\\" the album then moves into a stunning hat-trick of singles--\\"Love is a Stranger,\\" \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" and \\"Who's that girl,\\" which are three of the very, very best technopop songs ever recorded, and all in one year, 1983, to boot.  \\"Here Comes the Rain Again,\\" \\"Would I Lie to You,\\" \\"Missionary Man,\\" and \\"It's Alright, Baby's Comin' Back\\" are my favorites of the remaining tracks, but all of them are solid 80's pop singles.  Even the MOR flashes of \\"Revenge,\\" though not my favorite Eurythmics moments, have stood the test of time, while other examples of the genre (Remember \\"Starship\\" and \\"Heart\\" circa 1985?) have not.    The remastering is good, and makes a noticable difference from the earlier CD versions of these tracks    This compilation collects the strongest singles (if notsongs) from their best albums, and forms a great companion piece to the remasterd reissues.  If you own no Eurythmics, start here, and you will want them all.

B0006FO8RA|4.0|If you listen to the album closely, she changes her voice little by little. It's gets a little quieter and less stronger. Just something I thought I'd put in. Anyway, whether you would like this album or not really depends on what you have already got. <br /> This album recieves four stars from me because of the catchy tunes and all the hits are on here, so basically, you'll like every single song (except maybe her new ones). Britney Spears may not be the greatest singer in the world like Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera but she can sing. If she couldn't sing, how did she get a record deal in the first place? Her voice was much better during her first couple of hits though. <br /> However, if you have all her albums like me, or already have a few, this isn't for you. It's nothing new. If there are songs that you don't have already, buy the actually album like Oop . . . I did it again, or something. There are some songs there that are really good but arn't on her greatest hits.
0307236722|5.0|Outstanding! That's about how to sum up Martha's lastest tome on the finer points of baking. As with all her other books, it is the attention to the details that makes her stand out among those who wish to emulate her. This latest addition to \\"kitchen education\\" is a real winner. I have never felt that being in the kitchen was a step back for women or anyone who enjoyed homemaking; there are those of us who relish the joy we bring to the table with the food that we gladly and lovingly prepare. You will absolutely love these recipes for cookies, cakes, breads, etc. Some are old-fashioned favorites and others have a new twist to them that will surprise you. I found several recipes from my childhood that I thought no one else would know, yet here they are in typical Martha-style with beautiful color and detail. It was such a wonderful surprise to find the sfogliatelle and pignoli nut cookie recipes that it made me think of the \\"old neighborhood\\" and that \\"blast from the past\\" alone was worth the price.<br /><br />You will be beyond happy when you see what is within these 415 pages of baking joy; I couldn't begin to count how many recipes are within these pages. But there are in all, six chapters of recipes, with the opening section giving you:<br /><br />  A Letter from Martha<br />  General Baking Tips<br />  General Baking Equipment<br />  General Baking Techniques<br /><br />Each of these above sections come with crystal clear photos that accompany each instruction point made within that area so you know of which pan, spoon, utensil, etc. you need to accomplish which task. This is the trademark of what Martha represents in her desire to give you every detail both visually and in written description.<br /><br />Then begins the excitement of what chapter to choose from:<br /><br />  One:  Simple Baked Goods<br />  Two:  Cookies<br />  Three: Cakes<br />  Four:  Pies, Tarts, Cobblers, and Crisps<br />  Five:  Yeasted Baked Goods<br />  Six:  Pastries<br /><br />The last section is then completed by:<br /><br />  Basic Recipes<br />  Sources<br />  Index<br /><br />Every single photo is so large, crisp, and so detailed, that you can actually see each delicate layer of puff pastry, when you are looking at the recipe for Chocolate Napoleans. All the breads and cookies and pies.........there is just no end to the spectacular content of this book. I feel that this is by far, one of her very best books, though this is exactly how she approached the creation of all her mediums.<br /><br />It is definitely \\"a good thing\\". Enjoy!y:           Basic Recipes         Sources         Index     Every single photo is so large, crisp, and so detailed, that you can actually see each delicate layer of puff pastry, when you are looking at the recipe for Chocolate Napoleans.

B000002552|5.0|One thing that I found hillarious in the No Way Home movie was how The Band was potrayed as Bob Dylans \\"muscle\\". When his original band didn't want to tour with him due to fear of being shot, The Hawks stepped in. A hard rockin' bar band with fear of little to nothing. Things seemed to have clicked right away, (listen to the 1966 bootleg set) together they pushed the envelope that much futher.<br /><br />In 1967 when Bob Dylan was recovering from his crash, he agreed to help these guys write some songs to release an album. He even offered to provide assistance in the recording of their album but The Band declined this offer, stating that they wanted to do it themselves.<br /><br />Instead the bunch of them spent hours just goofing off. THE BASEMENT TAPES are the best result of these sessions. The chemistry between these guys is excellent, as you can tell its all about having fun. There are no political songs, theres no real messages at all- in fact some of these songs could be considered complete nonsense- but its a good time.<br /><br />Bobby lends his vocals to some tracks that would eventually be re-done on The Bands Big Pink album, such as WHEELS ON FIRE. There are so many great rag tag type songs here its hard to pick favorites, but mine are ODDS&ENDS, for sure, love the pace on that one, AND the lyrics (juice), YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE, a great song that has become a staple in his recent live excursions, and CRASH ON THE LEVEE... but there are countless others.<br /><br />If you ever used to hang out and jam in the basement with some boys and a couple beers; you can dig what this album is all about. Its pretty well produced on this disc, I personally have a four disc bootleg and on that you have to sift through a lot of half cuts, and outakes- here its boiled down to a very nice package.<br /><br />Rock and roll.

0553801503|3.0|A good book but easily the weakest in a thusfar amazing series.      Like its predecessors in the Song of Ice and Fire series, 'A Feast for Crows' has a detailed plot and rich characters.  Yet again no one is safe (or so it appears). Yet again the plot of the book is informed by history but with a twist. The book was gripping enough that I was able to read 670 pages in one day.  It is worth reading.    But its not like the earlier parts of the series.  If like me you considered the earlier works to be amongst the finest literature, you might be disappointed. And afraid that the rest of the series may be good but not necessarily superb. And I enjoyed being spoiled with superb here.    The issues are:    * A plot that did not really progress (other then a tiny bit at the end).  Moreover, at times the plot (for the first time) seemed forced - a probable byproduct of Mr. Martin changing his planned chronology for the series over the past three years.    * Several major characters are missing.  The work focuses on people in Dorne, Kings Landing, Braavos, the Vale of Arryn, Oldtown and the riverlands. Don't expect those who are elsewhere to really show up. This was due to considerations of length, and I actually think Mr. Martin's division was appropriate enough.  I use the word 'enough' because frankly, at least compared to 'A Sword of Storms' the cliffhangers at the end of this book are not all that gripping (as some say it is 'Act II, Scene I') and so this break appears a bit arbitrary too.     *  Several of the new characters are not necessarily compelling or drawn out enough that we should care.  I don't think all contributed to the story telling.  Some characters appear to have been inserted to flesh out the world of Westeros but don't appear to contribute to the primary plot.    * The jury is still out, in my mind, whether the writing itself was at the same standard of the earlier works in the series (for example, compare the somber beauty evoked by the language surrounding Ned's dream in 'A Game of Thrones' with the best vision evoked by the prose here).  In addition, I hadn't expected it going in, but editing could have been better. I don't necessarily disagree with those who say large portions of this book did not need to be there.    Take this book for what it is, as opposed to what it is not, and you will have a good time.

B0002PUHF6|5.0|While \\"Re-Animator\\" is certainly a Loose adaptation of the Lovecraft source material, in its own way it's up there with darker, more serious Lovecraft-inspired movies like \\"Dagon\\" and \\"In The Mouth Of Madness\\".  It's been accurately pointed out that this is not the intense darkness of Lovecraft stories, but it also shouldn't be construed, and I don't think anybody intends to imply it, that this is a lightweight, 'tame' horror.  The scares and horror movie tensions are there, but they're fun, rollercoaster-type scares as opposed to disturbing or horrifying, an unusual choice for an approach to adapt an H.P. Lovecraft story, but one that works astonishingly well.  There is comedy in here, but \\"Re-Animator\\" is most definately Not a spoof.  What it is is one of the few movies to ever combine horror and humor with such great results (\\"Evil Dead 2\\" and the \\"Gremlins\\" movies are a couple of other examples).  And it's very sexy at times too, all elements fitting in together very well. <br /> <br />  Herbert West (played by Jeffrey Combs in the role of a lifetime), the title Re-Animator, has set up shop in the United States to continue his experiments in reanimating dead tissue after previous attempts in Europe (I think it was in Europe?) went awry.  A medical student gets drawn into assisting with West's twisted experiments and by the time he realizes how desperately in over his head he is things have already spun wildly out of control.  What follows is some of the more bizarre carnage one's likely to come across.  And of course, the quirky and impeccably fitting musical score must be mentioned; nearly as distinctive as the music from \\"Halloween\\"! <br /> <br />A great horror movie, and one that successfully taps a vein of the field that's usually quite difficult to get at.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Beautiful melodies, the zoom out/zoom in from the historical to the personal and the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink production make this one of the years best records. This is a celebration of the Land Of Lincoln with stops in Chicago, Rockport, and Highland to name a few and populated by such disparate characters as Blackhawk, Carl Sandberg and John Wayne Gacy. It is an ambitious project that suceeeds most of the time, my favorites being 'Casimir Pulaski Day' and 'The Predatory Wasp Of The Pallisades Is Out To Get Us!'. Sometimes Steven's reach exceeds his grasp,like on the John Wayne Gacy song which strikes me as sophomoric, but if you like lush production and pop melodies, you owe it to yourself to give this a listen.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I have never been a big Depeche Mode fan. I was really into the remix CD that came out last year. I have liked occasional tunes over the years. I have heard some of this record and it makes me want to go see them play live next month. Depeche Mode have always been a melodic electro group with rock elements. That is why they are playing as many gigs in California as U2 and Rolling Stones. Very few bands have this level of universal appeal. The combination of Martin Gore and Dave Gahan has always been a winning formula. The first two songs are big tunes. \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" and \\"John The Revelator\\" boils down their strengths to two brilliant tracks. \\"John The Revelator\\" sounds like them at their best. \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"The Sinner In Me\\" are more moody, darker tracks. \\"Precious\\" has that classic electro keyboard sound, which is like a tip of the hat to Kraftwerk. \\"Precious\\" is a classic Depeche Mode song. More proof that these guys still have what it takes. A few slower tracks follow. Much of this album deals with serious issues: depression and human pain. Another stand out track is \\"Nothing's Impossible.\\" The album moves towards a climax in one of its main themes in \\"Damaged People.\\" This is a moving ballad. This album has plenty of authentic soul searching and hope for redemption. It's unsure where the soul ends up. On \\"Lilian\\" Dave Gahan sings, \\"I need protection\\" and \\"Pain and misery always hit the spot.\\" On the final track Gahan berates a satanic force in \\"The Darkest Star\\" and accuses him of \\"playing the angel.\\" Even though most of this album deals with dark themes, it is very uplifting music.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|As usual with big budget CGI Animated movies from Japan in the forms of BOOTLEG - SELECTED THEATERS - COMPLETELY CGI - and - IMPORTS, the Japanese have once again beaten the second to last of their dead 'Final Fantasy VII' horse and conjured up the two year follow up of the 1997 Playstation game, \\"Advent Children.\\" This movie suffers from the natural flaw that most films of this format from Japan suffer; Trying to be too philosophized within itself when there's not that much complexity within this evergoing series of video games and mini movies that seems to suffer from the George Lucas syndrome. In all reality its as straight forward as \\"APPLESEED\\" is, only its not as interesting. Hardly after a year has past, Advent Children has finally arrived on U.S. borders in the form of its official DVD release. While the storyline is still pretty nonexistent the official subtitle translation and English dub somehow made the movie more enjoyable and a lot easier to understand compared to a fan translation.      Fan boys and rabid fangirls will ignore the fact that Advent Children has no plausible storyline and simply revel in the presence of the major, minor and cameo characters just because it tickles them to them again. In truth the movie could be called a sort of nostalgia piece of sorts for them. Newcomers are better off just playing the games past VII. Before watching the movie, I would suggest watching the FFVII Digest that covers all the important details in the video game. Its a major help to those who ever played or bothered finishing the game, plus it'll help you understand the movie a lot more. While I watched this I tried hard not to laugh at the little sprite characters running on the screen and the low grade animation used in the cut scenes. The only downside is that the subtitles move a tad bit quickly when your attempting to read the length dialogue.      \\"[My sister unwittingly bought a copy of the movie (noting that I simply love editing action sceneswith music I own). I was never bothered by the fact that Japanese with English subtitles was the only choice on the DVD, I watched the movie. I began to realize that none of the dialogue was making a bit of sense. In my honest opinion, I was confused through the entire movie until watching it a second time. If anything, its dialogue was trying to be too poetic and again, too philosophized when it explains in a child's voice what went down in the video game. Thus the explanation and drama of the story was lost on me. However, I did gather this much].\\"       [Disc One: The movie]:      The planet has begun healing itself from the devastating attack of the meteor (Jenova). A strange disease known as \\"Geo-Stigma\\" has arisen in its wake. As far as the people know there is no obvious cure, and children seem to be at greater risk. Cloud Strife, who is also infected with the disease, has secluded himself from the world, haunted by the demons of his past. Beforehand he established a delivery service with Tifa and once lived in the bar. Tifa's bar [Seventh Heaven] is now an orphanage for the infected children where she and Cloud have taken care of the children before his absence. Marlene Wallace, Barrett's adopted daughter, is entrusted to the care of Tifa. With them is a boy named Denzel, who Cloud, Tifa, and Marlene have taken in as their own. Elsewhere three villainous pretty boys [Clones of Sephiorth of an unexplained origin], Kadaj (the jubilant seeming and twisted ringleader), Loz (the big strong guy who cries), and Yazoo (similar to Kadaj in appearance with the exception of longer hair, more acrobatic and straight forward with killing) plans to revive Sephiroth or 'mother' as they have come to call him. They attack Cloud --or \\"Bother/traitor\\"-- under the assumption that he has what their looking for. From there proceed to kidnap all the children from Tifa's bar turned orphanage under the false pretense that they will cure them of their illness. Cloud is practically forced out of his seclusion, feeling responsible somehow but still thinks himself unable to help others he cares for.        The storyline is basically as straight forward as that. ADVENT may rival SPIRITS WITHIN in the animation department but so far FF:TSW has the better storyline, inspite of its departure from the game. As mentioned above, many of the characters from the game make cameo appearances throughout the movie, in Sailor Moon and Power Ranger styled appearances. They come just when a dangerous situation looks bleak and stand together in a dramatic pose before rushing off into the fray. All of them ready to back Cloud Strife in his battle again the three brothers and their plan to revive their original counterpart. The movie is more action than story. It impresses you with over the top action scenes that are fast and furious, equally dazzling but a bit clunky in most places. It was obvious from the start that ENIX was inspired by various Hong Kong and Jet Li films. Maybe even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. To my delight most of the battles are indeed eye catching and thrilling to watch. With the exception of the Tifa vs. Loz battle.Tthe trailer it made the battle look very cool. It ended up being erratic and choppy at best. The score chosen for the battle was a let down as well. I was expecting this fight to be second best at least. Of course when the action stops, the movie lags on until it begins again. Thus creating a sense of jet-lag, apparent in movies like 'Soldier' and the 'Harry potter' series to name a couple.        The obvious humor of the movie was not so lost on me like I had originally thought; The characters Reno and Rude are excellent comic relief but do turn out to be the more likable secondary male characters. I did laugh when Loz's ringtone was the silly victory song played during the game. Reno getting locked out his own building was a riot. Scenes concerning Cloud and Kadaj are bearable at best. A majority of the time you'll be trying to figure out what's going on within the erratic-blipping flashbacks or the close ups on Kadaj's eyes in certain scenes. Most of the scenes with Cloud will confuse you as you try to figure out whether if he's dreaming, or having flashbacks or if he's in the present. This is most obvious when a white screen appears and his talking to the late Aerith or is unconscious. Its rather confusing to those who don't have speed-vision.        SQUARE ENIX shows that they've recovered from their self-induced Bankruptcy from their first attempt at an CGI movie via \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,\\" by providing their viewers with beautiful CGI animation that does surpass its predecessor on many levels. They paid a lot of attention to the surrounding backgrounds and character models in the film. The clothes look like clothing and actually movie and shift like the material it imitates. The hair, faces, skin features, eye animation is more life like and realistic while still maintaining the GCI look. Its actually pretty, but has its problems if you look hard enough. The motion capture is better than it was in \\"Spirits Within\\" - capturing movement with flawless ease, thus further awing the viewer. However, there are still problems in terms of running and reaction motion. I also noticed a few problems with the motorcycles; They can be clunky sometimes. Probably because they defies logical limits of reality.         The score by Uematsu Nobuo and the Black Mages plays very little like video game themed music, though it carries that sort of demeanor. Instead of looping music of course, the score for FFVII:AC constructed like a normal lengthy and charismatic Japanese score. Most of the score didn't go so well with most scenes in the film (Loz vs. Tifa, Cloud vs. Kadaj's gang). I wasn't all too surprised that amateur guitar rock managed to find its way into the background during the heat of combat, ultimately making me want to clobber Nobuo and the Black Mages. Its less than impressive and while it does offer good moments now and then, it doesn't deliver like it should've. The revamped Sephiroth theme 'Advent: One Winged Angel' made me chortle because it sounded like something out a b-horror movie when paused to make the 'phsyco stabbing' sound effect. Once again the rock invades the theme half of way through the song, turning out to blend well with the roaring orchestrated symphony. The lyrical Latain vocals did impress me as well.          The translation of Japanese in the subtitles compared to the BOOTLEG subtitled version of ADVENT CHILDREN my sister got me, is so much better in terms of understanding the very little story, while maintaining the incoherency of Japanese dailouge. There are eight subtitle formats to choose from with English and Japanese audio only. I'm basically neutral when it comes to Japanese dubs in anything concerning Japanese cartoons and films. Mostly because with films like these, they usually get horrible English dub treatment (see: Appleseed). But to my surprise, the English Dub is brilliantly transferred on this CGI film like silk on skin. It practically rivals SPIRITS to a major T. It also brings to light how little dialogue there is in the entire movie itself. The voice actors really put their all into the characters -- with the exception of some hiccups in most characters (Loz for instance) --- and give truly convincing performances. While its a bit strange at first to watch the movie in English -- the mouths are clearly matched for Japanese -- it steadily becomes less eerie. With familiar (and not so familiar) English casts this should please anyone who gets a bit tired of reading subtitles.        While her role is relatively small, Mena Suvari plays the late Arieth well, captuiring the saint like personality. Christy Carlson Romano (Kim Possible/Even Stevens) reprises her role as Yuffie from \\"KINGDOM HEARTS,\\" and gives what charm she can to a character very few lines. Crispin Freeman (Wolf's Rain) and Quinton Flynn as the Turks Rude and Reno, were amazing actors for the characters; They were good during the comedic moments too. Former(?) Soap Opera star, Steve Burton's (whom I almost mistook as Mark Hildreth) voice is the embodiment of Cloud's character in the movie. His broody voice matches the emotions of character so well, its easily my favorite voice actor in the film (\\"Well, I'm gonna try,\\"). Steve Blum gives an excellent performance as a deep voiced and wise Vincent Valentine, whose plight seems to be to the lack of a cell phone. Beau Billingslea whom I know from Orgemon of \\"Digimon: Digital Monsters,\\" was an excellent choice for Barret Wallace. His gruff voice, however, did nothing to fix the silly expressions they gave the tough man.           Much like Mena Suvari, Rachael Leigh Cook (She's all that) as Tifa ---Cloud's potential love interest and caretaker of the children in 7TH Heaven--- was an excellent choice on SQUARE's part. Her voice lends a sort of human charm Tifa lacks in the Japanese language. She could work on the emotional range of her voice though. The child(?) voice actors, Benjamin Bryan and Grace Rolek as Denzel and Marlene Wallace amazing. Defiantly on par with Rachel Hirschfeld ---Antia King--- in ROD: THE TV. While many did not like Rolek's voice for Marlene I thought it went well the character and presented her childhood just well as the Japanese Va did. Bryan wasn't heard much through the film due to his character'd short time of the screen, but he does excellently when his voice can be heard. Especially when Denzel swears, no matter how silly it sounded. Steve Staley - (Kadaj), Fred Tatasciore - (Loz), and Dave Wittenberg (Yazoo) were practically identical matches for their Japanese counterparts; Especially in the grunting department. However, Fred Tatasciore was probably the weakest out of the three of them.           His characterization made Loz sound kind of lame and wimpy (\\"Meanie!\\"). Not at all like the tough guy presented on the screen. Dave Wittenberg had his weak moments as well, during Yazoo's fight with Reno. Chris Edgerly as the toothpick chewing Cid Highwind did well with what few lines he had; His Texan accent for character was quirky and something that made you laugh in a good way. Rick Gomez as Cloud's deceased friend Zack was also an excellent match for the character's short time on film. Lastly George Newbern (Wolf's Rain) as Cloud's arch nemesis, Sephiroth, was at first a big surprise. His voice matched the pale and menacing appearance of the villain so well it made me grin just listening to him. Once you watch the Cloud vs. Sephiroth scene a couple more times though, you begin to notice that Newbern's voice is just a tad bit on the soft side to be all that villainous. It doesn't detract from the character too much though. Other actors (namely Jamieson Price as the disembodied voice of Reeve Tuesti) that lend their voices to the film are as equally good as the core VAs, if not better.        [DISC TWO]:        Disc two is all that a Special feature's junkie could ever hope for. Its jam packed with more previews and scene segments for ADVENT CHILDREN's arrival than \\"making of's.\\" That segment is barely over the 60 minute mark at best. Subtitles are provided for the trailers and interviews with the creators in Japanese only, which was nice. If there's anything more annoying its listening to translators over the Japanese being spoken. Fans will obviously compared the US release to the Japanese release due to the anime \\"Final Fantasy VII: The Last Order\\" was not added to the special features disc. I particularly don't care to watch another thing chronicling events during, between, or after the video game. I'd just go nuts and crack from so much FFVII exposure!      1): Deleted Scenes - This section is composed of eleven half-completed deleted scenes. Most of which are things that deserved to be cut from the movie -- Cloud and Sephiroth's halfhearted conversations during their epic fight---. The others, however, are camera angles that weren't used or included in the film that were used in the trailers. Which in and of itself is probably not a totally downfall but would've probably helped the flow of the battles just a little more. Overall its a major disappointment for those who thought the deleted scenes would hold some kind of substance or importance they cut out of the movie. - 3/5      2): The advanced screening - This bunch of scenes collected into a twenty minute screening was shown when AC was first revealed to the public back in 2004. Its not much different from watching the film itself, maybe its put together a little better than movie in some cases but shows the same flaws (mostly with the Tifa/Cloud flashback). The end is one glorified action montage which was cool but it ended like all the other trailers shown on the DVD. - 4/5      3): Advent Children Trailers - These were a lot of fun to watch! Collected from various game conventions (or magazines freebie discs) from around the world (or just the USA), the first several AC trailers showcase the first bouts of animation for the film and how it improved as the time of its release drew near. The final two trailers were merely scenes from the final product and were put together much better. Out of all of the trailers though, the Festa Jump (2004/05) trailers had to be the most overly flamboyant and cheesy. -3/5      4): Making Of: Advent Children - This little segment was probably the best out of the entire special features on the DVD. It showcased various interviews with most of the core people who had a hand in creating Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. They explained their objectives and ideals for the films without revealing too much about the CGI graphics like most Special Feature DVDs would. Thus the movie will still hold some kind of awe factor if you watch again. One of the shockers for me is that, the director reveals that the scenario writer wrote a twenty minute script, which kinda explains why AC suffers so many flaws. Nevertheless, this is a must watch segment for fans. - 4/5        5): FFVII: Video game sneak-peaks - Only a FFVII fan could truly be delighted in this collection of trailers for this video game. The first one It showcases ShinRA company characters (Reno and Rude, etc.), entitled \\"Before Crisis.\\" The second, \\"Crisis Core,\\" details the demise of Zack and Cloud's manipulation during Sephiroth's turn to the dark side. To comment the art used in the anime scenes shown in the trailers, its not the best. The art is more or less the kind  you'd find in one of those low budget adult anime movies (the characters have unnaturally tall and skinny drawn frames. Or their top or bottom lips seemed to be dowsed with lip-liner or lipstick) and what not. The third is a trailer for a PS2 video game dedicated completely to mysterious Vincent Valentine, entitled \\"Dirge of Cerberus(?).\\" Its obvious that this is nothing more than a good time shoot em' up game complete with appearance of secondary characters from the game (Reeve, Yuffie) as well as some original characters that apparently have a grudge against Vincent. The last trailer is yet another AC trailer showcased on Cinematech's E3-2005 special edition, shown in its entirety. All in all, this section is for those FFVII hard-core junkies than it is the casual gamer. - 3.1/5        So all in all, \\"ADVENT CHILDREN\\" wasn't a bad movie, although it suffered from all the flaws \\"APPLESEED\\" did. That being trying to cram too much into a short amount of time or having little or no plausible story to go with the CGI. It also suffers from the usual 'I will stop you fiend!' Japanese demeanor (like everything else doesn't). The characters managed to be interesting despite the lack of development and the action was great entertainment. I'm no Final Fantasy VII fan, but SQUARE did a good job with the movie. Highly recommended action flick ------- [a 3 out of 5]

B00000J7JO|5.0|I first received this CD when I was 9 years old and did not know anything about music or rock for that matter. This album took me by surprise and I listened to it everywhere I went. I still now listen to is everywhere I go to this day. The album is a perfect blend of funk, alternative rock and punk. John Frusciante rejoined the band right before this CD to make it and he has never sounded better. The bass lines are frickin amazin and extremely catchy. My band plays about every song on this CD when we practice and at least every day I am humming a song from it in my head.  <br /> <br />The best song on the CD in my opinion and the best Chili Peppers song overall I think is \\"This Velvet Glove.\\" I love the overdubbed guitars with the acoustic strumming and a simple electric yet light lick going on with it. I also like \\"Get on Top,\\" which has an amazing chorus. This CD is a classic and if you are just getting into the Chili Peppers, buy either this or the greatest hits and you won't regret anything as long as you live.
038572179X|5.0|It is the rare book that you will continue to think about for days and even months after you read it.  This is one of those books. <br /> <br />The author is a wonderfully talented writer.  Without overdoing it or succumbing to hyperbole, McEwan is able to write such a detailed story that you literally feel that you are in the middle of it.  His prose seems effortless yet packs quite a punch.   <br /> <br />The story is a great one as well.  We meet Briony when she is 13 and is a very imaginative, attention seeking girl.  In one reckless act, she manages to drastically alter the lives of everyone around her. <br /> <br />This book raises wonderful questions about love, family and forgiveness. <br /> <br />A beautiful and thought provoking book!
B0000C1733|4.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers are without a doubt my favorite band and they define me as a person. This album was wonderfully selected with songs ranging from old school Peppers to their most recent efforts including 2 amazing singles. Fortune Faded is a alternative rock funk song that has wonderfully driven bass lines and an awesome catchy chorus. Save the Population, in my opinion, is an even better song and did not get any radio play like Fortune Faded did. Save the Population has some of the most unique guitaring from Frusciante than most Pepper songs. It reminds me of a latin-funk rock song or something. The chorus is also extremely beautiful and when John comes in at the end to harmonize with Anthony, it gives the Peppers almost a new style and different direction.  <br /> <br />If you are just wanting to get into the Chili Peppers, I highly recommend this CD. I only have one slight complaint with it is that \\"Can't Stop,\\" one of the best Peppers songs ever in my opinion, did not make it on the CD. I think they should of replaced that with \\"Universally Speaking,\\" a song I never really cared for that much. <br /> <br /> <br />
0385338082|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella and I was excited to see her depart from the Shopaholic series and to introduce some new characters. <br /> <br />I did enjoy this book for what it was-a sweet and funny but not very deep story.  Kinsella is great at giving her readers laugh out loud moments and in creating heroines who are genuinely likeable. <br /> <br />This story begins when Emma is on a plane ride and becomes very nervous.  Thinking she is about to die she recklessly reveals her darkest and most humiliating secrets to the handsome stranger sitting next to her.  Unfortunately, she soon discovers that this stranger is her new boss. <br /> <br />The book keeps you going and you remain interested in the characters throughout.  It was a good and fun read but did not have all of the zip and humor of the Shopaholic series.

0452282152|5.0|This book began with an interesting premise and did not disappoint.  Who really was the girl who posed in Vermeer's famous Painting The Girl with a Pearl Earring?  I think all of us have wondered this before when studying great works of art.  Was the model someone important to the artist or someone who just captured their eye for a fleeting second? <br /> <br />Chevalier does a remarkable job of introducing us to 17th Century Dutch life and in bringing us into Vermeer's household.  Griet, the model for the painting, begins life as a maid to Vermeer.  Over time her relationship to the painter becomes increasingly complex and brings to head a number of problems in the household. <br /> <br />Chevalier's writing is simple yet effective.  She is not prone to overly descriptive prose but still manages to make us see the scenes in the novel vividly.   <br /> <br />This is a wonderful and touching story that you deserve to read. <br />

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Yes, I know there's no plot. Yes, I know that it actually creates more questions than answers. However, the absolutely fantastic CGI kind of pushes that out of your mind. You will end up gaping at the screen in awe once the movie is over and your mind will not even think of plot until your second or third time through. <br /> <br />Plot: Set 2 years after the game, there's a mysterious disease infecting the children of Midgar. A trio of brothers, led by Kadaj, plans to use this disease to help them get Jenova and recreate Sephiroth, but Cloud, being our reluctant hero once again, can't let them do so. However, before he can save the world, he must first save himself from his own inner demons. <br /> <br />A lot of those inner demons involve Aerith. I thought we had solved this problem in the game, but it seems that we must bring this issue to the surface once again. <br /> <br />But who cares? The CGI was fantastic. The music was fantastic. The action was mind blowing. Overall, watching it will be an unforgettable experience that you won't regret at all. Because of that, 5 stars.

B00005JLKB|5.0|This show captures the spirit of Superman. I am not a fan of the original Superman movies because they did not do Superman justice but Smallville it is very well done. When I would sit and read Superman comics this feeling would come over me, a feeling of excitment, adventure and intrigue; this same feeling happens when I watch this show. My opinion, skip the old Superman movies and go straight to Smallville.
B000063DHK|5.0|This is one of the greatest heavy metal live albums out there. Some songs may be subpar to the studio versions, and Bruce Dickinson sometimes does go over thr top in some songs. However despite that, altogether this album rocks, because of a few songs.( Run to the Hills is much more faster and stronger than its studio counterpart. And Rime of the Ancient Mariner is the complete opposite of the Powerslave version. It is more stronger and it has great riffs). The song that really brought the album together was Hallowed Be Thy Name! Compared to the studio version, it completely blows it away. The guitars sound crisp, and distinct. You can clearly listen to Steve's pounding bass lines throughout the song. Bruce Dickinson is absolutely superb in this song, hitting every high and low. The original version sounds unamplified compared to the live version. If you like anything metal or Maiden, then the \\"Live After Death\\" version of Hallowed Be Thy Name is your song. <br /> <br />p.s. If you want a more stronger and powerful sound from the song. Try to diminsh or remove the bass when listening to the song. Although I feel bad for dissing Steve. But listening to it like this is the only way you can feel the power and force of the song. Trust me you can significantly tell the difference! ! !
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Troy is neither a faithful retelling of the Iliad, the epic Homeric poem it was inspired by, nor a Hollywood computer generated sword and sandal film hoping to cash in on the popularity of Gladiator. Instead Troy is the timeless story of people caught up by the ravages of war.<br /><br />The film begins at the end of a long war of unification by Mycenaean King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) of the proto-Greek city-states. In history the Mycenaeans were recent barbarian conquerors of Greece, and we get a hint of this especially in Cox's portrayal of Agamemnon. He is in turns arrogant, playful and greedy. The only Mycenaean king we see who is tries to rule well is Odysseus (Sean Bean).<br /><br />From the battle scene at the beginning of the film, it is Achilles (Brad Pitt) who grabs your attention. He is brooding, arrogant and thinks his immortality will be to be known as the greatest warrior in history. This is an interesting contrast to Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana). Hector is a veteran professional soldier, not a warrior. He wants nothing more but to end the war, and protect his people.<br /><br />The war in which he finds this immortality is started with Prince of Troy Paris (Orlando Bloom) encourages Queen Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) to run off with him, at the end of a treaty negotiation with her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Both come across as sympathetic, guilt ridden and fully aware of the disaster they have caused.<br /><br />Menelaus quickly goes to Agamemnon, his brother, for help to get Helen back. Agamemnon is more interested in taking Troy, a city astride the Dardanelle's (close to Gallipoli), and blocking his access to wheat grown in what is now the Ukraine.<br /><br /> The fight scenes take place the beach in front of the city, and eventually inside it. Most of them are done with CGI, though at times the movie can look like an animation from the PC game Age of Empires. But on the ground, they are bloody and full of frenetic energy. Pitt's Achilles fights ability, speed and strength. His cold blue-eyed stare says more then any words he may speak during the film.<br /><br />When he does talk, for most of the film it is to noble slave girl Briseis (Rose Byrne). Around her he visibly softens (and hardens again, but that comes later on). Until Hector kills his cousin Patroclus, in his armour, Achilles is all set to take Briseis, and sail away forever.<br /><br />Director Wolfgang Petersen made his name with the 1981 German film Das Boot (the Boat). Troy has a similar somber feel to it. Rather then filling his movie with typecast heroes and villains, his characters become people who are dealing with circumstances beyond their control. War is the only evil in Troy, and the only people we see are its victims.Pitt's Achilles fights ability, speed and strength.

0739308742|1.0|The absolute worst thing audio books can do is change a good narrator in the middle of a series.  I loved the first 3 books and Roy Dotrice was Great.  I wish I knew why they changed narrators in mid series.  That totally sucks!!  I don't have time to read the books and depend totally on audio books.  When it happened in Stephen King's Dark Tower series at least King explains that the original narrator was in a serious accident and could no longer narrate.  So what is the reason Mr. Dotrice did not do book 4.  I hope it is a good reason because I am very disappointed.

B0000024IE|5.0|It's been almost two years since Public Enemy released It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back - with their brave new work, Fear of a Black Planet, rappers Chuck D and Flavor Flav and Terminator X complement this ambition with stunning maturity and sophistication. <br /> <br />Fear of a Black Planet - twenty tracks and over an hour long - opens with snippets of newscasts, speeches and screams that define the album's direction: \\"There is something changing in the climate of consciousness on this planet today.\\" After this ominous intro, PE hits the ground slamming with \\"Brothers Gonna Work It Out,\\" an unflinching call to arms that steamrolls over a sample of Prince's guitar solo from \\"Let's Go Crazy.\\" <br /> <br />It's immediately apparent that Public Enemy has taken a hard look around after its recent problems and come up with some potential solutions. The chorus of \\"Brothers\\" commands, \\"Go get it ... get involved,\\" a sentiment echoed throughout the album. In \\"Revolutionary Generation,\\" Chuck D claims that \\"some say we wasting time singin' a song,\\" but his repeated arguments for the power of music demonstrate tremendous growth: \\"What counts is that the rhymes designed to fill your mind.\\" The careening rage of Nation of Millions hasn't been diluted - it's been given focus and substance. <br /> <br />Public Enemy's sound has undergone a similar transformation. Terminator X has always had a masterful sense of how to construct dense, insistent accompaniment to Chuck's roar and Flavor Flav's goofy whine. The Terminator still brings the noise, but the noise is more varied - there's even a move toward melody. Chuck, for his part, has never sounded better; he speeds through a track like \\"War at 33 1/3\\" sounding like he might lose control at any moment but still articulating the labyrinthine internal rhymes perfectly. And Flavor Flav's chants - used to fine effect on \\"911 Is a Joke\\" - are more singsongish and less grating. <br /> <br />A half-dozen songs at the center of Fear stand as the most powerful work PE has done to date. Once we hit \\"Polly-wanacraka,\\" a slow groove over which Chuck drawls observations on interracial dating, the intensity progressively builds. The first acceleration is \\"Burn Hollywood Burn,\\" a scathing diatribe about the movie industry's treatment of blacks that features Ice Cube (formerly of N.W.A.) and Big Daddy Kane as guests. \\"For all the years we looked like clowns/The joke is over, smell the smoke from all around,\\" Chuck sneers. <br /> <br />\\"Who Stole the Soul?\\" challenges the IRS - or \\"Intentional Rape System\\" - for its treatment of black stars like James Brown and Redd Foxx. The surgical thrust of Chuck's accusations moves this song beyond Nation of Millions' dismissal of whites as \\"grafted devils.\\" Finally, Public Enemy pulls off its biggest surprise in \\"Revolutionary Generation,\\" which turns out to be a feminist anthem. Though sometimes misguided, the song's passion and good intentions win out. It's inspiring to hear the men who wrote \\"Sophisticated Bitch\\" now saying, \\"I'm tired of America dissin my sisters.\\" <br /> <br />A sample montage, a Flavor Flav musing on self-sufficiency and a quick reggae-style jam follow, and then Fear picks up for a breathless race to the finish. \\"B Side Wins Again,\\" a manifesto about the power of dance music as \\"Food for the brain - beats for the feet,\\" and \\"War at 33 1/3\\" fly by almost too fast to notice the bite of lines like \\"time to smack Uncle Sam.\\" The album ends with last summer's \\"Fight the Power\\": Surrounded by the rest of this extraordinary record, the song takes on heft and becomes more a program than a mere slogan. <br /> <br />For all of Fear's seriousness, Public Enemy has also developed a kinder, gentler touch. \\"Ain't we all people?\\" asks Chuck; he claims that \\"all I want is peace and love/On this planet/(Ain't that how God planned it?).\\" And PE reveals a sense of humor in the chipmunk-voice chorus on the title song and the hilarious Driving Miss Daisydis that ends \\"Burn Hollywood Burn.\\" <br /> <br />Public Enemy may still be criticized for not renouncing Griff - who is no longer affiliated with the group - explicitly enough. And the antisemitic overtones of \\"Welcome to the Terrordome\\" (not to mention the \\"Elvis was a racist\\" charge on \\"Fight the Power\\") are no more acceptable now than before. But the new attitudes and more pragmatic worldview on Fear of a Black Planet say more than any apology could. <br /> <br />Public Enemy is looking to the future, not with apocalyptic despair but with fiery eyes fixed firmly on the prize. The group's determination and realism, its devotion to activism and booty shaking, make Fear of a Black Planet a welcome, bracing triumph. I give this album 5 stars.
B000002P7R|4.0|The only reason I bought this was for the track \\"Pali Gap\\", which was originaly on the now deleted (but one of my favourite LPs)  the \\"Rainbow Bridge\\" album. After Jimi died, so young and unexpectedly, he left a lot of unreleased and half finished material. This material became the main contents of albums released after Electic Ladyland. Some of these LPs are now deleted and re-issued in other forms since the Hendrix family won back the rights. South Southern Delta is one of these re-issues. <br /> <br />I wasn't expecting a lot but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Although mainly a collection of unreleased jams and half finished songs- if you've already heard the \\"Are you Experienced\\" \\"Axis Bold As Love\\", and \\"Electric Ladyland\\" albums, it's quite refreshing to put on something different.  <br /> <br />Although there maybe the odd number you may want to give a miss there also some gems to discover too. I liked the version of, \\"Message of Love\\" even better then the \\"Band of Gypsy's\\" version, which is saying something since that was my all time favourite Hendrix song. It sounds very much like he recorded that particular number with the Woodstock line up. Power of Soul also sounds like the same line up and seems to be taken from the now deleted Crash Landing LP. There are some good jam numbers including the excellent, \\"Midnight\\" with its earthy middle eighth section. Although SSD is not as slick a package as albums recorded whilst he was alive, it still a pleasure to listen to the new direction he was developing at the time.
B000002U82|5.0|I looooooove this cd.  It is brilliant from start to finish.  Usually i do not review cds, but when i saw how many idiotic kids with adhd gave it one star i had to comment.  Britney Spears, Christina Agulara, and 50 cent arent better then this. im thirteen and even ive thought that pop and rap sucks for a long time.  just because you dont have the attention span to appreciate the intros and slow instrumentals doesnt mean its bad.  it just means u need more ridalin.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Bought the CD, went to the concert, was disappointed at both. There's just not enough Santana in \\"All that I am\\". Instead, I went back to my own all time favorite \\"LOTUS\\". It's sad to see so much potential going to waste. It's discouraging to know that the quality of his music is decreasing. I just hope that next time he decides to come up with an album it shows more of what he truly is; A GREAT MUSICIAN, and not a back up guitar player as he seems in this album.
0553801503|1.0|An extrodinary waste of an evening. The only reason I kept reading was out of frustration thinking something had to eventually happen. When it finally did \\"happen\\" it wasnt very spectular or interesting as none of it was happening to any character I gave a hoot about. Pages and pages of drivel about unimportant characters doing unimportant things that do nothing to advance the plot. Martin it seems has been too busy reading the reviews about what a brilliant writer he is (when not making a fool of himself over the election results. As if anyone cares about his political opinions) so much so that he spends endless pages writing nothing. <br /> <br /> <br />Well perhaps nothing is a bit harsh, lets say he spends an entire book doing little more then setting up the plots for another go. I suppose since he kind of killed everyone off and threw everything into chaos its sort of necessary, but in my own view there's far too much drivel tossed in that isnt neccessary and I'm not happy about spending 25$ just for a plot realignment. Furthermore, considering that according to Martin the next book is basically the second half of this book, only a part of the story that happens simulaneously, one can only imagine that the next book is going to be yet more plot adjustment. So 50$ and four years later I am what? Apperently, set up to wait another 4 years before one can only HOPE we actually get on with the story. <br /> <br />Well one can hope anyway.
0895260131|1.0|As I read through the book, it became clear that this was much more of an opinion piece (someone's opinion) than an academic book of fact.  Through-out the book there were extreme emotional opinions such as \\"he lied\\", \\"his insatiable lusts\\", \\"licentiousness, cruelty, and ruthless ambition\\", \\"much-ballyhooed (and grossly exaggerated)\\".  Much of the content (as exemplified by these 'extreme' words appears to be written by someone with hatred toward Islam.  This book therefore, appears to be nothing more than propaganda against Islam.
B000B894AI|1.0|I wanted to really enjoy this book, and I will admit that the first half was entertaining. But the conclusion of this story is totally implausible. Far too many lose ends --plotlines that took chapters to build-- get wrapped up in one or two paragraphs. And all of the \\"evil\\" characters are totally ridiculous. They are totally one-dimensional and unrealistic, like something out of the comic books I read as a boy. <br /> <br />I couldn't wait to finish this trainwreck, but I kept hoping for something better. <br /> <br />I want my eight dollars and six hours of my life back.
0553801503|4.0|Here I am, a carrion crow who ordered the UK edition to have an earlier feast, only to find the bones picked all too clean by the wolves and lions who came before me.  Seriously, after finishing this book, I'm still hungry! <br /> <br />And you will be too.  Even knowing that you won't get the POV's of Tyrion, Jon, Davos (although I never liked his), Dany, and Bran, it is still difficult to feel satisfied after reading this book.  The UK edition has 700+ pages but with significantly larger print than the 900+ pages in A Storm of Swords.  And this thinner story contains more POV's from new characters that, well .... let's say could be edited.  For example, Arya, my favorite character has 3 chapters (that are great) and Victarion Greyjoy, who we've never heard from before, has 2.  His aren't bad but they're like having appetizers instead of a main course. <br /> <br />Has George gone nouvelle cuisine on us?  Well not entirely.  There are 10 chapters on Cersei and a significant number on Jaime and Brienne as well.  But WHY only 3 on Arya?  WHY only 3 on Sansa?  The same amount of time passes in both places so why do we need to hear every thought that goes through Cersei's head and witness every dress that goes on and off her body while we're left with only skeletal, teasing information about 2 characters who I thought were more important?   <br /> <br />Although this book is only half of what the author envisioned, it should still stand more firmly on it's own.  The stories are stretched very thin compared with the previous books and the dramatic action suffers. <br /> <br />Still, it's not worth slamming completely.  It's a great world, a great author and great characters.  Just give us more meat and less parsley next time George!
B00003CWL6|5.0|The entire movie, while portraying a guy at a dead end in life, has an energy and suspense to it that keeps you watching. <br /> <br />You know throughout the movie that a lot is not right in this comfy suburban paradise. It seems that everyone in the film is off track, and gradually losing it.  You wonder whether outside forces will crush the main character, Lester Burnham,brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey.  Or whether he will explode. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite Spacey films.  His redemption films like Pay It Forward do not appeal to me. <br /> <br />Really worth seeing more than once.  Of course, if the mere setting of movie in \\"blissful American suburbia\\" makes you cringe, this is not for you.  But if you can get past that, it's a terrific film.
B00007BK2N|5.0|This is a really good movie with an excellent excellent screenplay. The movie begins with the birth of punk, when a small roomful of people were fortunate enough to catch the Sex Pistols when they first came out, changing the course of music, and ends with the death of acid. As Tony Wilson puts it in the film, it is the \\"story of Manchester,\\" that begins when a group of young and idealistic local boys decide to screw London and its record companies and start producing their own records out of Manchester, and boy, has music history benefited from this decision. It's interesting to note that as these young lads on the forefront of the music scene in Manchester began to age, they become less idealistic as they were in their youth, and more acknowledging of reality and its limits. My only complaint is that I wish the movie could have had more on Joy Division and New Order, than on the Happy Mondays. Why did Tony Wilson ever sign a band that came in last place in Manchester's Battle of the Bands??? The casting for this movie is outstanding, as well.    Two big thumbs up.    P.S. I don't know why they used the cover that they did for the DVD. It really has nothing to do with the film.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I am not even going to go into the trouble of writing a long review about why this movie was so bad. If you watch it once and honestly like it, then that is your perogotive and you are entitled to that...but, this movie really sucked. Terrible acting, AWFUL computer animation, and a shockingly pathetic plot made this movie a BIG let-down. I guess the plot is the main downfall of the movie-Dracula (who was very poorly cast in my opinion.) and his brides need some sort of energy lifeforce from powerful beings to bring there gargoyle-looking mutant babies to life. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale have to save the day. As if the plot wasn't bad enough, the film makers had to create some of the WORST computer animation EVER to grace the big screen. The animation makes it look like cartoon characters rule the movie.  NOTHING looks even remotely real and almost every NON-COMPUTER GENERATED scene is so obviously a movie set that it is hard to endure the countless scenes of lame character dialouge and predictable action sequences. Anyways, I thought this movie was a huge bummer. I saw it with a group of people and we all just laughed and couldn't believe how we had wasted 2 hours of our lives watching such a bad movie. Save your time and pass this one up.
0553801503|5.0|Yes, perhaps Feast for Crows does not quite match up with Martin's previous three books in the series, but don't let the negative reviews fool you: this is still an excellent book.  It's almost to be expected that Martin would slow down the pace a bit after the incredible events that ended book 3.  Killing off Robb, Catelyn's resurrection, Jon Snow's promotion to commander of the Wall, Lysa's murder and Arya's escape: these are all events that it took 3 books to build up to.  It's only natural that Martin allow the reader a chance to catch his breath and start building up the momentum for even greater events. <br /> <br />Thus, much of book 4 is concerned with some of the less important characters: a lot of Jamie, Cersei, and Arya, and not so much Jon or Dany.  And no, the plot does not advance at a breakneck pace.  But this doesn't make the book bad.  To compare Martin to Robert Jordan at this point is just plain unfair.  Perhaps if Martin's next three books kept up a pace in which nothing occurred and more and more characters were added for no clear reason, then the negative outcry of the readers might be justifiable.  But as of now, Martin is still involved in a hell of a story that is not diminished in any way by the latest installment.  It's simply a different pace than his previous books, and not necesarily inferior.  All the history of the characters involved is intriguing, and it should be obvious that book four is a stepping stone Martin needed to get to the big events in upcoming novels. <br /> <br />So in all, an excellent book in its own right.  A tad slow, but still a high quality piece of work.  Song of Ice and Fire is coming along nicely, and all fans should be optimistic about the future.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|First I would like to say that Tonga and Raymond need to keep the eye on the prize; please review the movie, NOT THE PREVIEWS.  Forget the Previews. <br /> <br />That being said, this is the greatest college comedy of all time.  John Belushi gives one, if not his greatest, performances before his death and Tim Matheson and Tom Hulce steal the screen.  The best National Lampoon has ever done.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Ok, it's not thta brilliant, but it is way fun.  This is a light, fast, easy to explain abstract strategy game.  There is no theme.  THis game is great for the non gamer because it takes all of about 30 seconds to explain.  Now people could take forever with thier turn and slow the game down, but I have played it many times, and have yet to see someone do that except toward the end.  Even then, they are only to see if thier is any place they go.  The best part of the game is that it makes you feel smart playing it.  Who knew they could come up with a mind game that is actually addicting and fun?  I guess the maker of tetris knew it.   <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  There is more strategy than you would think.  It is way fun and fast.  get this game for you and your family.
B000A6T262|5.0|Ten years after the final episode, including a resurgence that was bigger than it's low Neilson dictated,the first motion picture based on the original Star Trek series arrived in theaters.It would also spawn a successful film series that would go on through nine more movies and 23 years with a varying degree of success.   For 1979's Star Trek The Motion Picture,the filmmakers wanted to compete with Star Wars in terms of special effects & budget.And like all effects laden films, the script gets diluted.The whole V'ger revalation may've looked good on paper,but we have to go through a long drawn out build up that makes you feel it should've been a 90 minute movie,let alone a TV episode.Star Trek has always been about the story and  characters.The chemestry between the crew, a little rusty since its been a decade since they've acted together,is always a saving grace.   Star Trek from the get-go has always worked on a low budget from the Classic series on down. TMP should've been an example to the Berman-era TNG movies,big budget never equals better movies.   Coming after the successful yet overbloated TMP,ST II(1982) The Wrath Of Khan was a leaner and no less meaner film that really kick started the Trek we know and love today.No other villian(aside from DS9's Gul Dukat)commands your attention like Khan(first seen in the original series episode Space Seed).Where he was set on conquering in Space Seed,he's hellbent on revenge which makes him an even effective villian.Kirsty Alley's Saavik injects a dose of new blood into the veteren crew, and the battle scenes(a far cry from the cheap opticals and camera shaking of the original series)are very effective and even the newer offspring(TNG DS9,VOY,ENT)have taken their cue from this film for space battles.Regarded as the best Trek film,Wrath of Khan has yet to be toppled,though it has come close(The Voyage Home,The Undiscovered Country, First Contact).   Star Trek III The Search For Spock (1984) establishes the\\"odd numberedfilm curse\\",which odd numbered Trek film are regarded as disappointing (finally broken with Star Trek X Nemesis).   Of the odd numbered Star Trek films,TSFS is the best.Not as great as the even numbered,but holds up better than Generations(VII) and V The Final Frontier.   Leonard Nimoy's direction is surprisingly well done,despite the hokey outcome of Spock's resurrection.The destruction of the Enterprise was both effective as well as heart-wrenching.even the supporting crew members(Scotty,Sulu,Uhura and Chekov),always ignored in the past,also have great moments.   As a bridge between II and IV,it seems like a holding pattern that is best  watched as the middle of a trilogy in one sitting.   Like The Trouble With Tribbles,ST IV The Voyage Home (1986) may not be the best(II tops them all),but it's certainly many fans favorite.   What makes this film work is its humor as well as its warmth and heart.The cast look like they're having so much fun filming it, that it rubs off on the audience.Equally funny is seeing our beloved crew of the USS Enterprise,looking awkward and out of place in the 20th century.   The movie is also fast paced and tightly edited as many obsticles(the Klingon Crystal depletion,the search for the whales in the ocean as well as the hospital scenes)pile up upon one another yet successfully resolving themselves.Subsequent film that try to replicate IV's formula end up looking clumsy(V and Insurrection)because they miss the point that behind great comedy is heart.   As a continuing chapter in the Star Trek films,ST V The Final Frontier(1989) bites the dust.The plot was ridiculous as the Enterprise is hijacked by an outcasted Vulcan zealot,who turns out to be Spock's half brother in his search for God.The Nimbus III planet setting reminded me of those bad post-apocolyptic straight-to-video flicks,& poor De Kelley looked like he could've had a heart attack (though his presence is always a godsent in TREK).   But if was intended or not,it has an Ed Wood-esque appeal,being humorous without even trying.The scene where Spock & Bones expierience their past pain is effective in bringing some sense of drama in this farce.   In a world where one of the most popular Trek episodes is one of the worst (SPOCK'S BRAIN),V is mostly seen as one of the many bad chapters in a great tapestry of stories.  ST VI The Undiscovered Country (1991)is a fitting swan song to the original series crew which bridges many event that shows up on subsequent series(The Khitomer Accords,Klingon Honor,etc).The film gives our aged but beloved heroes a send-off that couldn't even be cheapened by the next film,Generations token TOS apperance.   Its mix of action,suspense,and even mystery making this a very entertaining film.The return to the directors chair of II's Nick Meyers is a godsend(attn Rick Berman,Should've hired Mr Meyers for Star Trek X).As Capt. Sulu of the Excelsior fittenly puts it,\\"Nice to see you in action,one more time.\\"   ST Generations (1994)passed the torch between the classic crew and the Next Generation.The historical meeting of Captains Kirk & Picard is what Trekkers longed for.Unfortunately,the result is a convuluted extended TV episode,a very irksome Data,an impressive yet unnessesary destruction of Enterprise D ,and a very shoddy death of our beloved Capt Kirk.Impressive at first ,but repeated veiwings makes it's flaws all the more obvious.  This special edition DVD gets points for featuring scenes cut from the original film(Kirk's orbital skydive), as well as tons of extras not featured on the first edition. The commentary is interesting as Brannon Braga and Ron D. Moore, the film's writers confess that they tried too hard too please and now can't help but cringe at certain scenes.  The TNG era films has yet to capture the big screen experience like the classic Trek films.Of the four films,ST:First Contact(1996) is the best ,even ranking with The Wrath Of Khan,The Voyage Home,and The Undiscovered Country.Unlike the other TNG films,this is the closest to a real movie as it is fast paced,action packed and has agree of warmth and humor.   Patrick Stewart is always a commanding presence as Capt.Picard(Kirk may be the best Captain,but Stewart is the best actor to sit in the chair),and his quest for vengence against the Borg (stemming from being assimilated by the collective in TNG's Best Of Both Worlds episodes) is captivating as well as terrifying.And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations.   A great battle scene with the Borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes alternating between 2063 earth(which show's the first earth warp flight with Zephram Cocherane,later followed up in ST Enterprise) and a war zone with the Borg on the new Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all too convienient TV ending.   Aside from these minor flaws ST:FC is a movie to be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike.  After successful movies(which are usually even numbered)there is usually the problem of the filmakers second guessing fan expectation, injecting a bigger budget into the following movie and hoping to capture the previous film's magic.For ST Insurrection (1998), the budget was more than the average box office take of the other films.A better movie than most of the Oddies(except III),it had some very funny moments,and Patrick Stewart seems to be having fun as Picard as he turns his back on Starfleet to protect a paradise planet that the Federation wants to harvest for it's resources.The story would've been better suited for TV,and considering the great quality of episodes on the spin off series Star Trek Deep Space Nine (The Dominion War),you also feel the writers should've strived for more on the big screen.   Unfortunately the Box office tally was lower than expected,despite being a very entertaining film.But it wouldn't bea box office disaster like the next movie. ST Nemesis (2002) (Which bears the burden of a knuckle-headed decision being released between  a Harry Potter movie and LOTR The Two Towers)is both the most praised and harshly criticized of the ten films. The biggest problem(aside from the whole Trek franchise being at an all time low)was the story using ST II The Wrath of Khan as a template.The Next Gereration's final mission as they are led into a trap by the new leader of Romulus who has a deep connection with Capt Jean Luc Picard.The sub plot of finding yet another Soong android didn't make things any better, as well as a cheat on the fate of Data.   The belief that Romulus would be controlled by not only their sub race,The Remans,but also make the Praetor,a human clone of Capt. Picard,as well as having an agenda to destroy the Federation(A repetitive,yet empty plot device).Nemesis has many great moments as well as the most exciting ship battle scenes ever seen in a ST movie.But as much as the TNG movies try,they are still big screen TV episodes.   Despite the many gapping plot holes as well as hearing fans rip this movie to shreds(It ranks above Search for Spock and Generations),Nemesis is still an entertaining movie(How could you top the collision scene!!!).
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Batman has taken a whole new twist in this completly different telling of the story of the dark knight. The 40's produced some lame seriels, the 60's produced a campy comedy of Batman and Robin, but it left confusion when Tim Burton decided to base his 1989 version of Batman on the comic books and show the REAL Batman story that only the comic book fans knew about.  <br /> <br />Tim Burton did a great job with his Batman, and a decent job with Batman Returns (1992) but the saga slipped and fell on its bat-butt with the other 2 shockers.  <br /> <br />Now, 16 years after Tim Burtons vision of Batman became what it became, this newer version goes back to the roots of Bruce Wayne. Everyone knows the sotry of Bruce Wayne, even your great grandmother whose not a fan knows Bruce Wayne's parents where killed, then he goes into hiding and returns to Gothem as the caped crusader..... BUT, for the 1st time ever, we get to see what happend in those years he was away from Gothem. And where he learned his skills, and the big question of WHY he would decide to be Batman.  <br /> <br />This edition focus's its history and remaking from the comic books. So, forget everything you saw in the Tim Burton versions, this is not a prequel to those same stories, this is comepletly starting over and is the begining of many more sequels to come. <br /> <br />PLOT. <br />Dorothy finds herself in a strange place over the rainbow.  <br /> <br />New stuff.  <br />I didnt like the look of the new Batmobile at first, but after a while it grows on ya, and when ya can see what it does....well, i wonder if I have a stocking big enough for Santa to fit one into? <br /> <br />The Batsuit and gadgets are more beleivable this time around. Which was there intention. It all ends setting up for the sequel. <br /> <br />Batmans no academy award winning movie, but that matters not to me, cos i avoid those overrated garbage flicks anyway. This movie you can just sit on ya bat-couch, on ya bat butt, with some pop-guano and kick off ya bat-boots and enjoy watchign Batman.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|i am a big floyd nut so i got this for disc3 and 4. disc3 has the complete concert including the hug at the end and the speak to me buildup. the quality is perfect, better than the bootlegs. <br /> <br />disc4 the rehearsals are cool. it has some interviews about how they got together for this event and a complete rehearsal of WYWH. i was hoping for more but it was cool. <br /> <br />i still got to watch the other performers but the list of good acts is astoudning. it comes with a little 3 page booklet that shows which artists are on which disc. the package is a small box with the discs folding out. whats fun is that Geroge Bush is on the cover of disc4 :P <br />
0812550706|2.0|From the number of reviews on Amazon, Ender's Game must be one of the most popular sci-fi novels ever written. I have read many sci-fi novels over the years, and what I usually expect are ideas about science, technology and the future of humanity, based on insights into today's science, speculation, and imagination. Sci-fi novels don't have to hold up to literature standards, as the quality of the ideas behind it is what matters the most. In addition to the ideas, we also enjoy a good plot and adventure,  fleshed out characters, and/or detailed descriptions of an imagined universe. <br /> <br />According to this criteria, I cannot say Ender's Game scores very high. While it does contain some speculations about military technologies and politics in the future, the lack of description and reasoning behind those few ideas is quite unusual when compared to other established sci-fi novels. The technological aspects of military training and techniques are also described with such superficiality that the artificial feel to it becomes quite palpable. **SPOILER ALERT** The crucial twist at the end, when it is revealed that Ender's game was real, is totally unconvincing given that we are never told how the whole system really works, beyond \\"they know you are a genius and would follow any orders given\\". Card needs to put more effort into convincing us that children can be leading adults, by actually showing it to us. ** SPOILER END **  <br /> <br />Ultimately, it doesn't seem the author had much more insight into the future than your average reader. Which is why it sounds strangely painful to me that this book is repeatedly called the best sci-fi ever. It is a book written for kids and young adults about isolation and the psychology of military-style training, but hardly can be called science fiction.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Pop Kulcher Review:  I joined the party a bit late, jumping on the Death Cab bandwagon only after the release of 2003's sublime Transatlanticism, but I made up for lost time by listening to that disc around the clock. Hell, I still do. And the new one, Plans? Not as good. But still a great album. Let's put it this way: it kinda makes me wish I were back in college, just so I could invite some sweet young thing back to my dorm room and play this disc to impress her with my sensitive side. Not like I ever did anything like that when I was in college; just saying.<br /><br />I mean, really, this is pretty mushy stuff. Soul-searching, love and life and death and all the stuff of philosophy seminar essays. Which is ok with me, especially when it comes in such a nice candy-coated package. Hey, I can do lo-fi with the best of 'em -- ask me about my Guided By Voices EP collection, please -- but there is something to be said for pure, gorgeous sonic ooomph, and Plans has plenty of it. If Transatlanticism showed a huge leap forward for the band in terms of songwriting quality, catchiness, and production, this one shoots for the moon. At least sonically. Musically, it's a bit of a drop-off. Nothing that jumps out of the stereo and throttles your neck like, say, \\"The Sound Of Settling\\" from the last time. But it's a pretty consistent disc, with only one track lazy and shambling enough to send me reaching for the \\"skip\\" button. My advice: Go buy Transatlanticism; if you've already done that, and you liked it, then get Plans.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|My wife and I watch a good number of movies.  It's very rare that we both dislike a movie.  I think the last time we really did not like a film was The Avengers remake. Well, you can add this movie to that list.  What a bomb.  Without even comparing it to Willy Wonka, this movie was a complete disaster.  Johnny Depp destroys Mr. Wonka, the children are incredibly bland, and the music is downright awful.  This film was a major disappointment.
B0009R1T7M|3.0|Pop Kulcher Review:  Every six months or so comes one of those buzz discs, the kind that every critic is thrusting in front of you like it's the second coming, but actually stopping to pick it up seems like too much of a chore, too much responsibility, like making yourself actually sit down and watch Citizen Kane or Schindler's List instead of plopping down in front of Pulp Fiction for the 20th time. Plus, those albums are generally just inaccessible enough that listening to 30-second online samples doesn't really do it for you; there's no hook to grab you. But eventually the guilt takes hold and you buy it. And on first listen, of course, you hate it. But maybe you come back a few months later and next thing you know it's your favorite album ever. That's happened to me a few times; the Flaming Lips' Soft Bulletin comes immediately to mind, a disc I put off buying, loathed on first listen, and then couldn't stop playing once I gave it a chance. The Magnetic Fields' 69 Love Songs box set had a similar effect.<br /><br />And so with Sufjan Stevens' 2005 release (Come On Feel The) Illinoise. Or at least it started out that way. Jeez, talk about glowing press. Article after article about this thing, and Stevens' vow to make an album for every state (this is his second, following Michigan, which wasn't as heavily promoted and which I haven't checked out yet). So, yeah, I caved. And, after the initial hesitation, I fell in love with it. Or at least the first half. It starts out just like all those other critics' dreams, utterly unique yet bringing to mind loads of other artists -- orchestral lushness, gorgeous lyrical balladry, campy cheesiness, over-the-top prog-like flourishes, making me think of the Flaming Lips and Magnetic Fields, sure, but also Neutral Milk Hotel and Elliott Smith. Lyrically, it seems to be an assortment of small-town tales, maybe a middle-America response to the Kinks' ode to pastoral Britain in Village Green Preservation Society.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the contagious wackiness of the title track, it slides downhill (a few exceptions aside), with way too many meandering slow songs and instrumental interludes. For the first few songs I was so excited by the overall weirdness of the thing that I could overlook its flaws, but by the end I was just. Bored. Silly.<br /><br />But, hey, I'm gonna give it time. Albums that go out of the way to be different, challenging yet warm, do earn a bit of extra indulgence. I'll see how it turns out.  At worst, there are 5 or 6 absolutely breathtaking pieces here, and that's probably 3 or 4 more than most albums these days.fortunately, after the contagious wackiness of the title track, it slides downhill (a few exceptions aside), with way too many meandering slow songs and instrumental interludes.

B000AADYYO|5.0|***** - FIVE STARS <br />=================== <br /> <br />The best Metal release of 2005, and quite possibly Opeth's finest hour ever recorded.... <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Reveries\\" is a perfect balance of what Opeth is all about. This has the Death Metal growls, but it's also got plenty of clean vocals as well, which I personally find more enjoyable when listening to Opeth.... <br /> <br />I love Opeth for their music, and the fact that they don't set boundaries when it comes to composing fresh material. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" carries every great characteristic that defines Opeth's sound in my opinion.... <br /> <br />The production of \\"Ghost Reveries\\" is simply flawless. It's one of the clearest sounding releases Opeth has ever done. Every instrument being played can be heard clearly, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the overall packaging of \\"Ghost Reveries\\". Like I said, EXCELLENT PRODUCTION.... <br /> <br />I'd rank \\"Ghost Reveries\\" as Opeth's finest offering to date. It's that solid, and should be considered ONE, if not THE best release of the year. You must listen to \\"Ghost Reveries\\" to fully appreciate this masterpiece.... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AQACO8|5.0|This album is absolutely in my top 3 favorite REM albums.  The DualDisc is great with the three music videos.  Also, if you have a home theater, you can enjoy this in 5.1 surround sound.  The mix is fantastic.  Document is like you've never heard it before.  The 5.1 mix is available as Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 for regular DVD-Video players.  If you have a DVD-Audio player, there is also a high-resolution surround and stereo track. <br /> <br />Well worth the money.  Bring on the surround sound mixes for more of the early REM albums!

B00004THAY|3.0|I think that there is a strong tendency amongst reviewers on Amazon to give everything that is sort of good five stars!  I mean, does all good music deserve an \\"A\\" or the equilivant of a five star review???  No, and this effort by BB and EC is a good example of well executed; well produced studio blues.  They don't wade into any new material or offer any new sounds that blues lovers haven't heard before; and frequently we've heard more passion and abandon than this CD offers.  What's good about this CD?  BB King does most of the singing and seems more alive and energetic than he has in several years.  EC, lets face it folks, he just cannot sing.  And as a blues singer his range is narrow and he sounds as emotionally flat as the characters from \\"One Flew Over the Cockcoo's Nest.\\"  Sure, EC can play the guitar and we are reminded of that every waking hour of our lives; but when you place EC next to a Freddie King; T-Bone Walker or Elmore James there just isn't the emotional impact that these masters were able to command.   <br /> <br />But if you don't know a whole lot about the blues; this CD will satisfy that occasional need for well produced, slick blues.  For the truly fanatical blues fan, give this one a pass and put on those old Otis Rush, T-Bone Walker songs for the real thing.

B000002MJR|5.0|I saw the group live while they were on tour in 1991/1992.  This is a better concert than the Alchemy concert, although not as good as the 'Brothers In Arms' tour in 85/86.  But it is a perfectly respectable farewell from Dire Straits, as a couple of years later (1995) it was revealed that the group would be laid to rest for good and Mark Knopfler's solo career took off.  All the selections here are of a good standard, and its also worth checking out the DVD of this concert, which has a few extra tracks not available on the CD.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|While most of these songs can still be found on my parents' hard drive, downloaded from my days as a Napster junkie, the Deftones' B-Sides & Rarities offers some new, unheard surprises, making it the perfect fan homage. Chino Moreno and Far's Jonah Matranga deliver a powerful duet on Jawbox's \\"Savory,\\" which is then followed by a cover of the Cocteau Twins' \\"Wax and Wane.\\" However, I'm really not sure if the (hopefully) ironic cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Simple Man\\" really meshes well with the rest of the tunes. With the exception of a few acoustic versions of their more popular songs, B-Sides & Rarities plays out more like a cover album than anything else, but in no way am I complaining. <br /> <br />Nick Walker <br />Synthesis.net

This CD is a must have once you hear the conviction in the harmonies you'll never take this CD out your system!

B0009A40ES|5.0|Based on Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel American Psycho, this film tells the story of an 80's yuppie named Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) who works on Wall Street by day and kills people by night. Like the often misunderstood novel, the film is more of a dark social comedy than a real horror story. Bateman dresses and talks like all the other wealthy, young Wall Street crowd, and thus mistaken identity plays a big part in his getting away with gruesome murders again and again. Bateman's own grip on reality begins to blur over time and at various times throughout the movie it's quite obvious that Patrick's view of reality is a sick, homicidal dream of endless torture and killing. Even when Bateman confesses at one point, no one listens or seems to care. Everyone has their own agenda and the main concern of Bateman's friends is which extravagant restaurant to dine at next, or getting the latest and greatest business card to impress one another. <br /> <br />Casting Christian Bale was a brilliant choice by director Mary Harron, who almost got fired from the project because of not choosing Leonardo DiCaprio for the starring role. I honestly don't think anyone could've captured Patrick Bateman's personality more flawlessly than Bale, who gave an extraordinary, chilling performance. And casting Reese Witherspoon as the prissy, bubble-brained Evelyn, who's engaged to Bateman but knows nothing of his psychotic, homicidal behavior, was a perfect choice. Much of the dialogue in the film is taken directly from Ellis' book, and the horrific violence of the book was toned down considerably, with much of it taking place off camera. Many viewers don't seem to appreciate the frequent humor in American Psycho, such as the various times Bateman says crazy things like, \\"I'm into murders and executions\\" that no one seems to hear. And his philosophical ramblings about the music of Huey Lewis & the News, Phil Collins, and Whitney Huston are hysterical!  <br /> <br />The new \\"Killer Collector's Edition\\" is a mixed bag as far as worthwhile special features go. The documentary \\"From Book to Screen\\" is in depth but instead of having new interviews with the stars there are mostly boring interviews with film critics. Plus, it seemed like there was way too much coverage of the novel and very little on the actual shooting of the film. There's a lame video essay read by some singer and a documentary on the `80s. Thankfully, there are several deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary) as well as several humorous trailers. My favorite special feature (and probably the main reason why you should by this edition) is the director's commentary which tells lots of entertaining behind the scenes info. And, the picture and sound quality are better than ever! American Psycho IS NOT a film for everyone, but for those who enjoy intelligent satires with a little horror mixed in, this modern classic is a definite must for your DVD collection! And before you judge or even watch this movie, you should read Ellis' novel to appreciate the whole, uncensored story. <br /> <br />\\"I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?\\" -P.

B000000993|5.0|A good dozen years after this was released, it's still hard to beat. Besides being my favorite of their four (at this point), I'd also call it the best starting point for newcomers. I say that because \\"Undertow\\" has all the punch of their debut EP \\"Opiate\\", but at album length, and all the power and quality of their next disc, but without all the annoying non-song tracks. Obviously \\"Sober\\" was the popular song, as was \\"Prison Sex\\", but each track on the album has the same pace and intensity as those two. Only the last track \\"Disgustipated\\" treads odd territory, but in a good way. Henry Rollins even does some vocals on \\"Bottom\\". This is one of just a few albums that still today blows my mind, much like \\"Psalm 69\\" or \\"Badmotorfinger\\" does. It gets and deserves one of my rare 5 star reviews.
1401301010|4.0|I have to say, I will never look at The Red Hot Chili Peppers in the same perspective.Not to mention Anthony.The amount of drugs that were used are death defying acts, that could of ruined one of the best bands out.The book is depressing at times like whne Kurt Cobain dies,or a fellow guitarist dies.<br /><br />Women,drugs,music sums this book completly.Their is so much time emphasizing Anthony's chidhood that you almost forget what became of him.Once you get to the late 80's everything seems to be shortned liek Anthony had nothing better to write about so might as well make it as short as can be.A large chunk of the book is perculiarly the same thing over and over.Anthony was a kaniving wiesil needing money for drugs he eaither stole the money or sold stuff to pawn shops and thus he went out for drug binges.He becomes spber briefly then has alittle drugs here and their and becomes a fanatic again and again.I was wrong when i originally reviewed this he does speak alot of his music just i was just very caught up in how long and drawn out his drug days were.It's cool to know the inside scoop about certain songs and the meaning of some of their insanity.The constant change in guitarist also give you a better idea of The Chilis ever changing sounds from funk to commercialism pop/rock.Like i said the photos are a nice edition to the book,not needed butnot rergreted.<br />I enjoyed this book alittle bit more,now that i looked at it differently.I originally mentioned i got this for 25$ even though you can get this for under 20$ i don't feel the least bit scammed thats how strong this book is.

B00002MZ2C|5.0|So many original songs it just makes me wanna cry because I know they are no longer together.  This band is different from other political bands because they call out the government (war within a breath) instead of using metaphorical symbols and trying to look creative.  This band was not just making these songs to have top 20 hits and be famous.  They made these awesome songs to move people and basically tell them if they dont like how they are being represented, get off their asses and do something about it. (Testify)  <br />   Sleep Now in the Fire just made me wanna stand up, tap my feet, and pump my fist in the air like the drawing on the album cover.   <br />   Mic Check is like no other rage song i have ever heard.  Calm Like a Bomb just f***ing blew me away.  Guerrilla Radio is amazing and i love zack screaming \\"All Hell Cant Stop Us Now!!!\\"  <br />   The best album that they ever made.

0679406689|5.0|Simply suberb; as good, perhaps better, than \\"Remains of the Day\\".  But I read it too fast while on vacation; needs reading at a slow measured pace.  Author's voice incessant throughout, with so much wisdom packed into so few pages.  Incredible how Forster foresaw today - the book is so current.  Our society is too full of movement and change; we need \\"only to connect\\"  - to connect to the earth, to each other, and perhaps, most importantly, to ourselves.  I did have trouble with Margaret's love for Henry Wilcox.  Why?  The movie was very well cast and holds up well to the book.  Just all the wise words left out.
B0006399FS|4.0|I see that quite a few people are dissing this cd, which isn't fair. I'll admit its not perfect (i skip over 3 or 4 songs usually) but it still holds some of u2's finest work to date.

0446677450|3.0|On the whole, this book is okay for a nice quiet read but I have quite a few gripes with some of the views of the author: <br /> <br />1. Kiyosaki says that to take control of your finances you need to control your expenses and invest in assets which contribute to your income. He's right, but that's basic common sense and I don't need a book to tell me that. That's something that people should realize by themselves. <br /> <br />2. Kiyosaki seems to have a very poor view of the employed class in general and paints a very dreary picture of their lives. I know lots of people who love their jobs and are not broke. It is not impossible to build up your wealth and enjoy a comfortable life while being employed. I can't believe that half of all doctors are broke. The author never mentions the job satisfaction many employees get when they do life saving/pioneering work, etc. <br /> <br />3. Kiyosaki seems to oversimplify the process of becoming wealthy through real estate and stocks. Some of the deals he talks about seem unreal. I also doubt that getting information about IPO's pre launch is feasible. <br /> <br />However, I do agree with Kiyosaki when he says that financial learning should be a part of the school education system. The level of financial literacy among many adults today is low. On the whole, this book is probably meant for your kids, so that they learn to save, invest and be wary of credit cards.

0553801503|5.0|I'll start out by saying that I couldn't wait for it to come out and bought the UK edition and got it on Oct 18th and then sped my way through it in a few days.<br /><br />The general reader complaint with the book of course is the omitted POV chapters. However, had you been following along at George R.R. Martin's website you would have know that the book is really half a book as a result of publisher pressure and their reluctance to produce an 1000+ (possibly closer to 2000) page book (the bottom line rearing its ugly head).<br /><br />Mr. Martin would have preferred to make it a single book, but what resulted is a good compromise of full character arcs for half the \\"cast\\".<br /><br />Some have complained about the lack of chapters for Arya and Sansa, but quite frankly it makes a good deal of sense. Both characters are in situations where there is little going on that they can alter given that they are still children and are both students, learning their craft  from their respective mentors while maturing towards adulthood. That is when they will be able to really make a difference in the world.  More than anything, time has to pass for them to do this and extra prose would just take away from that goal.<br /><br />A Dance of Dragons which will contain more Arya and give us back Danerys, Tyrion, Jon, Bran, etc is essentially the other half of the book and will tie things together and move us into the future and a bit too. At the very least DOD will be a longer book than this volume, probably somewhere between ACOK and ASOS so we'll at least have something meaty to read (and reread while we wait for book 6)<br /><br />It does not look like books 6 and 7 though will be cut in half the same way 4 and 5 will be as the compromise does do a bit to reduce the richness of the overall story. What would be nice is after Dance of Dragons comes out is a timeline of the plot. Thus readers could go back and read book 4 and 5 together in the chronological order as originally intended. (Then I think we will have a 5-star book).<br /><br />As for the writing style, nothing has deteriorated in terms of Mr. Martin's approach and the quality. It is still excellent and the quality of his prose remains consistently good.<br /><br />The characters all have wonderful depth, all having their particular strengths and flaws giving them a richness that makes them feel like real people (I think we all know someone like Cersei who thinks she is smarter than everyone around her and gets in well over her head, relatively speaking of course) and not the same old tiresome archetypes and clich&eacute;d protagonists and antagonists of other series.<br /><br />The plot, logically so, has slowed down a bit. A Storm of Swords was a book where major changes occurred for some of the major players in this world and those characters that remain must now rebuild their power bases and their lives, which as in real life, tends to happen at an incremental pace.<br /><br />I highly recommend all current readers to stick with it and keep the faith.

B000BB1MI2|4.0|Tim Burton's take on the Roald Dahl classic story \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" offers up a mouthful of oh-so-good entertainment for the whole family.  As with most remakes, folks tend to compare the original with the remake.  With this film, there really shouldn't be any of that.  Tim Burton's film based on the story by Mr. Dahl is a unique and fresh take on the story, not a shot for shot remake of the 1971 classic.  Burton's film sets its own course and does a damn fine job of doing so.  The visual look of this film can hardly be put into words but if you had to it would only fit into one: amazing.  The inside of the factory is stunning and breathtakingly beautiful and even the Bucket's modest home holds a certain visual appeal.  The whole visuality of this film has the look of a dream or of another world altogether.  The casting in my humble opinion is the only slight flaw of this film.  The supporting cast was about as good as could be expected but I didn't particularly care for the casting of Grandpa Joe or Charlie.  I loved Johnny Depp as the quirky and wacky Willy Wonka.  His performance flat out makes the film.  His energy and style shine through in every scene he's in.  While watching this film, you almost wanted to be a kid again and be one of those lucky five to walk through the enchanted halls and rooms of the incredible Wonka chocolate factory.  At times it seemed like Depp was a little too Michael Jackson for his own good, but it worked out well in the end.  An outstanding film from start to finish for adults and kids alike, this one will endure for years to come.

Nothing is over-described and repetition is a staple of the narrative. The story is gripping and gritty. No one who has read this book has wanted to put it down.<br /><br />I passed the book to my husband, who found himself on an airplane with his hand pressed to his mouth in horror at some of the passages.<br /><br />I was relieved to find that this is not your typical \\"addict sees the light\\" tale. There's no cheating and nothing feels false. It's out in paperback, so grab a copy and share it with a few friends. Heads up for graphic (painful to read) scenes and a generous helping of profanity.
0060934913|4.0|This book gets me to the gym. I don't care that his writing skills may not be the best, and that he may get a little repetitive.  I love this book. It is very entertaining!  I did a short stint at a butcher shop when i was in college and I can relate to many things Bourdain discusses. Now I am a registered nurse at a busy NYC hospital, and I can relate on a whole other level...we are also in the trenches, we also survive with a crass sense of humor, and we know what the underbelly of our industry is really like. People need to stop taking this book (and THEMSELVES) so stinking seriously and just enjoy!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I love the music, I just wish I could play it on my computer and MP3 player.  Unfortunately, the copy protection software installed on this disk prevents that. <br /> <br />I am one of the few people left who actually believes that artists should be paid for their music and makes a point of buying and not pirating CDs.  In return for being a good citizen, I get a CD that is unplayable.  Goodbye Foo Fighters.  Hello KazAA.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To start out, this is my first review.  I usually don't do things like this, but in this case I am making an exception.  I remember a couple of years back I happened to flip the remote to a show on FOX called \\"Firefly\\".  Not really impressed with what little I saw, I changed the channel to something else.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I see the movie Serenity on the recommendations of a few friends.  After seeing the movie I decide to give the series a (longer) second chance by borrowing my friend's DVD set.  Now I'm buying my own.  I can go on and on about the merits of this series.  The two things that stood out the most for me were the overall story and the camraderie between the characters that brought them to life.  These are two things that are sorely missing from the Star Wars prequels.
B000000W5N|5.0|the stones and \\"sticky fingers\\" a album of pure beauty and great production what the stones did for music in the early 60's and early 70's were to make masterpieces of superb quality that today's band would love to make but can't...so get this cd and listen to some lovely songs with some great sax solo's then once your finished with this cd buy exile on main street and beggars banquet the other two stones classics  <br />
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I've gotten serious in collecting Depeche Mode records only in recent years.  At the moment this one is absoluty my favorite!  As others have said, perhaps its one song shy of perfection.  One blimish song doesn't come close to bringing the album down with it.  When I heard \\"Nothings Impossible\\", I felt that song immediatly and loved every sound on the track, like it came from my soul.  Mind you this is a very rare event for me.  I knew it was a song I Needed to hear. 11 songs on this record are Perfect to me.  One is less than great, but Depeche Mode has blown me away, again, and this record is especially profound.

0380807343|5.0|This is a somwhat spooky story about a girl named Coraline (not Caroline as the crazy old man says)  It is like a modern version of Alice in WonderLand but without the silliness.  It may frighten or confuse children under eight and I recommend it for people of all ages above that.  This story is mainly about how Coraline tries to escape the wicked other mother, free her parents from the other mothers cluches, and free the souls of the children who live in the mirror.  She will encounter the other mother, a talking cat who helps her on her journey, and the rats who help the other mother and give Coraline spooky messages.  If you like books that are a little bit spooky,  sort of weird, but a lot of fun to read, then this is the perfect book for you.
630518299X|5.0|This is a funny and original movie with a serious side. I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is thought-provoking or philosophical, because it goes way beyond Orwell's 1984 to the point of absurdity. I would say that the serious side is more like a mystery or a thriller - you sense that something is very wrong, but you don't know quite what until later. But in a way this movie did presage the growing lack of privacy and even the television phenom of \\"reality\\" shows. I really liked the concept of the artificial city in this film. If we could build such cities on the moon they would be the ultimate vacation destination!
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones reads more like an historical novel than a fantasy novel.  Deep characterization, complex political moves, detailed geography and culture, as well as the occasional humorous line all build to a gripping and epic story.  Yes it's long, but I've never read 800 pages so quickly.  This is serious fantasy, where magic is scarce and monsters unheard of.  When something supernatural does appear, it's impact is overwhelming. Kings and armies clash. It is an adult book though, with sex and violence described vividly.  No hobbits or elves or other childlike pixies here, just sword on mail and snow on clammy skin.  This is fantasy you can believe in.
B00006IM9Q|3.0|I'm not a big fan of this type of music, but I must say that this album was not bad at all.  I would suggest this cd if you are a fan of late 70's early 80's pop music.
B000002U82|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the best albums i have heard, or own. Very good lyrics, very good music altogether. A MUST HAVE!!!
0385510454|5.0|unlike many others I have always enjoyed John Grisham's novels. I read his legal background into most and find It truly helpful in his writing. The broker swings out with a somewhat less than Rambo start and continues thru causing you to await the Uzis and RPG's to begin but it never starts. I would assume we would call it a thinking mans battle. The parts on Italy began to drag somewhat but then he came out with a great finale. All in all I would say that are as good as any of his others and his total sales stands to his ability. He is good.
B0007M22TI|2.0|I bought the DVD. Individually, they are very good, perhaps even great. But the concert didn't work. Visually it was awful. Too flashy. Think of Danny Boy. A song invoking fraternal love between rural lads and fear of parting by violent death, sung by women in glitzy dresses on a Vegas-style stage? Come on! When they sing, they don't seem to know what to do with themselves so they kind of wobble around. The cameraman-ship was 2nd rate. Audience pan shots reveal a lot of folks sitting on their hands. Closeups get too close. The blond fiddler played great but the very regular swooshing of her long hair seemed too affected, especially when playing slow pieces. Ugh.
0060930187|5.0|Slyvia Plath did something in literature many other lesser writers would kill to do.  She used strokes of light and shadow to capture a living archetype in all of its dreadful beauty and fragility - something almost unnameable but close to us in the world within which we live.  But she went furthur than that.  She saw herself through a glass darkly and within the archetypal she discovered a person.  Archetypes are archetypes but persons are an entirely different order and magnitude of being. <br />I have a hard time describing to myself what the actual nature and greatness of \\"The Bell Jar\\" is.  It exists in a place where mere mood becomes something objective and transcendent; a place where our words fumble about on the fringes of counciousness to describe a face that is so achingly familiar, lovely, terrifying in the richness of its capacity for self-destruction.  Not a whisper is soft enough to capture the delicacy of the portrait of Esther Greenwood.  Her cynicism is sad and accurate.  When I think of Plath herself peering out through Greenwood's too wise and too hopeless eyes I am reminded that there is a state of being that is neither sane nor insane - it is hyper-sane marked by a terrifying lucidity possessed by only a few people in human history: Jesus Christ, Simone Weil, William Shakespeare, Sylvia Plath herself, of course, in her poems also, such as in the last flower she offered up for our inspection \\"Ariel\\". <br />Plath's lucidity is knowing.  She knows herself and she sees something in the world, something that can hardly be spoken but also cannot be refuted. <br />The great American writers of the Twentieth Century are Flannery O'Connor, R. A. Lafferty, William Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, and Sylvia Plath who gave herself to us completely but only for an hour.  Only her ghost remains and it will haunt us until the end of time.
0060839872|4.0|For a complete novice, the book explains some Greek philosophy and argues why it's relevant today. In particular, the author explains the contrast between Plato the idealist, and Aristotle the empiricist. There's also a (scanty) discussion on the tussle between dialectic and rhetoric.    Unfortunately this otherwise well-written book can't serve as an introduction to Greek philosophy and rhetoric. A student should get hold of Plato's \\"Gorgias\\", Aristotle's \\"Rhetoric\\", and Vickers' \\"In Defence of Rhetoric\\" for starters. The history and development of rhetoric is worth studying in depth and has relevance today, even though historically it was eclipsed and overshadowed by philosophy. Pirsig touches upon some of this all too briefly.     An entertaining read, and instructive for the novice. But keep in mind that Pirsig was an amateur, not a professional.
B000B0WODA|5.0|I don't understand why people are so disapointed. Why do people want another debut from this band. They've already given it to you. \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" is NOT the same as their debut. It is progression.  Why would you want another \\"Take Me Out\\"? No. Although I LOVE their glorious debut, I'm glad this not a replica.   However, Franz Ferdinand still radiates thier sexy tongue in cheek attitude only they've matured enough to incorperate \\"ballads\\" like the very Beatles inspired \\"Eleanor Put Your boots On\\" and \\"Fade Together\\".   \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" somewhat reminds me of \\"Veni Vedi Vicious\\" by The Hives a tad bit (and that's not bad; it's very very good). If there every was a complaint that these songs sound similar to one another then it's probably with \\"You're The Reason I'm Leaving\\" and \\"Well That Was Easy\\". These two great songs could very easily become one. Try and listen to them back to back. You'll hear the similarity but perphaps Franz has done this on purpose. Tracks 6-8 (to me) is a trilogy of three stages of breaking up. All around the album is all delicious and sweet. My favorite tracks are \\"This Boy (super sexy song), The Fallen, and What You Meant\\". Noticed how I didn't mention anything about \\"Do You Want To\\". Opps.
B00097DXZS|1.0|As a Santana super fan this album feels so empty, sad and desperate.Supernatural was ok, Shaman,recicable and this one is pure crap.Santana please go back to yourself, Abraxas, Zebop, Inner Secrets, Moon Flower etc... The guitar lines sounds improvised and anoyng on top of this not Santana music, do yourself a favor, don't waste your money and time...Booooo
B000000OQY|1.0|I listened primarily to heavy metal in my high school days--i.e. early '90s. This song has no redeeming value, and I've never had any respect for Axl Rose since.  Just like you can't respect Sebastian Bach when he puts on an \\"AIDS kills f*gs dead\\" shirt.  Presumably civilized people should draw an ethical line....sOMEwHERE! <br />        I've branched out, and now I listen to all kinds of genres, but recently got interested in re-listening to some of the old high school music (Iron Maiden, Nirvana, early Motley Crue, and others)... I would even like to relisten to some of the earlier G 'N' R stuff like Appetite.  But I would never willingly sit through One in A Million again.  I would never sit through Griffith's Birth of a Nation, and that has much more cultural relevance if the irresponsible and inflammatory discourse of hate is what you're seeking. Cheap and offensive publicity stunt, sorry commentary on the times as well as the group (after all, none of the other band members made any serious protest as far as I'm aware.....any info I'm not privy to)...
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie, as I am watching it right now for the 498574 time, is amazing. It's the kind of movie you will never forget. The fight scenes are incredible and the entire movie itself is so entertaining, you won't want to get up!<br /><br />My favorite part would have to be \\"The Origin of O-Ren\\" which is all in anime. It's fantastic, art at its finest.
B00005JNX0|3.0|Really, we've seen all of this before, and done better.  CGI in an of itself is no longer enough to intice the families into the theatre.  The huge success of \\"The Incredibles\\" was not in the excellent CGI work, but in the fact that the story could have worked just as well with live actors.  Good script, good dialogue, and good acting really do make a difference.<br /><br />However, the studios that churn out these CGI vehicles on a regular basis don't seem to have noticed this.  They think that if you get some big-name talent for your voices, throw in a little slapstick, some toilet humor (for the under-10 crowd) and some hip pop culture references (for the parents slowly dying in their seats), then you have the makings of another blockbuster.  Certainly this movie ultimately will show a modest profit for the investors, but if I recall correctly, the box office results can be charitably described as tepid.<br /><br />When we watched it, the kids were, at best moderately engaged by the movie.  They've seen enough CGI so that it is no longer a novelty.  There just wasn't enough in the movie itself to hold their interest...the characters were either uninteresting or annoying, and the storyline meandered too much to hold their interest.  Suffice it say that the adults would have rather been doing anything else than enduring this.  Echoing other reviewers, everyone liked the penguins, but that is hardly a recommendation for the movie as a whole.<br /><br />I would not consider buying this movie, as I doubt the kids would watch it more than once.
B00008AWOG|5.0|With Still Life, Opeth treats listeners to one of the most intricate and complex albums in metal history.  More impressively, Still Life is beautifully melancholic aggression in the form of song.<br /><br />It all begins with an eerie and sparse intro. which literally explodes into one of the heaviest tracks Opeth has ever put on wax: The Moor.  This opening opus is a perfect taste for what is to come, and at this time in Opeth's career, ushered in a new level of vocal and songwriting proficiency.  When this song finally hits the verse section at the 3:30 mark, all hell breaks loose as Mikael unleashes the beast that has now become one of, if not the best death metal vocals in the business.  As the song violently twists and turns through pulverizing riffs, drum blasts, and solos, Opeth integrates their trademark acoustic sections with a grace not present before, or replicated since.<br /><br />In giving this album the edge over Blackwater Park, I think this very element, the seemingly impossible symbiosis of the distorted and clean sections, is indicative of what makes this the crowning achievement in Opeth's career thus far: the songwriting.<br /><br />Instead of simply attaching clean and distorted passages together, Opeth splices them.  The effect is often a haunting soundscape which can can unfold into more intensely quiet acoustic movements, or continue to emphasize the endlessly sustained distorted gutair melodies.<br /><br />Matching the polarized quality of the instrumentation is a stunning juxtaposition of clean and death vocals.  The clean vocals on \\"The Moor\\", \\"Godhead's Lament\\", and \\"Face of Melinda\\" are exquisite, and provide a perfect complement to the menacing growl so unmatched in contemporary metal.  Unlike all other Opeth albums, Still Life also finds the vocal arrangements at their most natural.  At times, it seems that Opeth songs make the vocal transitions out of habit/expectation.  Like the integrated acoustic/heavy passages though, every vocal change on this album is methodically and effectively placed.  On this masterpiece, the vocals match the mood, and not necessarily the intensity of the musical backdrop.<br /><br />The result of this assiduous songwriting is a perfect collection of vivid tapestries, all telling their own stories, which, as stories mimic life, do not just lean on one emotion, but follow a progression of cause and effect.  Each dark composition weaves together the mutually dependent feelings of melancholy, rage, despondency, isolation, betrayal, and regret.  And while anyone who knows my opinion of Opeth knows that its ability to create palpable emotion is, in my opinion, what truly sets it apart from other metal bands, no other Opeth release can match the pathos of Still Life.<br /><br />With Still Life, Opeth secured the place as my favorite band.  A band of epic, progressive, and crushing proportions, Opeth exploited its assets to the absolute fullest on this release.  Any fan of true metal, even those who do not tolerate death metal vocals, must hear this album.  To hear Still Life is to witness the unavoidable change and progression of life.  As should be the task of us all, Opeth has taken the accumulation of the greatness of the past to create an indelible and unparalleled mark upon the world which reflects a respect for the past, and the added ingredient of its own originality.  Not only is Still Life Opeth's finest, but it's one of this music fan's top five albums of all time.ery vocal change on this album is methodically and effectively placed.

B00005JNQS|1.0|I don't know about other towns, but where I live, the malls were plastered with \\"Robots\\" placards, banners, posters, and cardboard cutouts, always a sign that the studio may be a little nervous about a product which may not sell itself well.  Throw enough publicity at even the worst film, the reasoning goes, and you'll get at least a few suckers who will be lured into the theatres.<br /><br />Not by choice, I was subjected to this film --- what a surprise, it was as contrived & calculated as I suspected it would be.  It should hardly come as a shock that it turned in a mediocre box office performance.<br /><br />Visually, it is slick enought, but isn't that the case with just about all CGI films these days.  Big deal.  Most of the performances were pretty much phoned in --- the only one that really stands out is Robin Williams', and that is only because that manic schtick is really getting old and annoying.  The movie is noisy, overproduced, and pointless.  For all of the noise & pizzazz, the kids were generally disengaged and when asked later how they liked it, gave a shrug of their shoulders in response.<br /><br />All in all, a real dud of a film that will largely be forgotten in only a few years' time.
B00005JNTX|5.0|If you like your action films dark and gruesome, with a dash of black comedy then Sin City might just be your cup of tea.<br /><br />Directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez manage to pull off the finest comic book adaptation to date.<br /><br />Based on the graphic novels by Miller, Sin City is a timeless and brutal metropolis where the men are ridiculously brave and the women about as sexy.<br /><br />Combining three of Miller's novels the film focuses on the ultra macho heroes Dwight (Clive Owen) , Marv (Mikey Rourke) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis).<br /><br />Set in eternal night-time, the street wise trio embark on their own personal crusade to avenge personal injustices. In turn, they find themselves in a tangled web of corruption and evil.<br /><br />Our heroes motivation is more often than not the sassy women who inhabit the streets of Sin City. In classic comic style these vixens are all red lips and leather with a nasty sting in their tail.<br /><br />Femme fatales such as Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), twins Goldie and Wendy (Jaime King) and Gail (Rosario Dawson) work a sleazy end of town that often becomes a battle ground between the honest and the corrupt. The women are sexy in a way that many may see as sexist, however as a counterbalance they are also as tough as the heroes and hold their own as characters.<br /><br />Sin City's visual magic comes mostly from the subtle use of CGI to create a graphic and believable urban backdrop. High impact colour set against a monochrome background gives a feeling that you are literally stepping  into a comic book.<br /><br />However what really takes this film to another realm is how true it stays to the level of violence depicted in Miller's novels.<br /><br />Simple deaths take a back seat to multiple castrations, beheadings and amputations.<br /><br />The contradiction of combining simplistic and clich&eacute;d dialogue with this ultraviolence has the mark of special guest director Quentin Tarantino written all over it. There are laughs the entire way through as extra cheesy lines are coupled with bloodthirsty fisticuffs.<br /><br />It's an interesting film to bring out in such a time of political ambiguity. The black and white of Sin City's characters certainly harks back to a time where society was perceived as a lot less complicated.<br /><br />Sin City is most definitely fantasy cinema at its best.tten all over it.

B00003CX5P|5.0|i have been a die hard star wars fan sense i saw the first one <br />when i was five years old and i am still a die hard fan. when i <br />heard that there was another star wars movie coming out i was <br />estatic, i thought it was going to be about luke and leia and when i saw it i was a little disappointed but after watching it <br />for a while i began to like it. the little boy playing anakin  <br />skywalker was so cute and he was wonderful in it. natalie portman was great as the queen, and ewan mcgregor wasn't bad either. <br />i loved the pod race and the laser fights,and the battles in space were amazing, some of the boys i grew up with thought that <br />only guys could love star wars but they are wrong because girls could love it too. <br />i still wish that mark hamill  was in it because i always loved <br />him as luke skywalker but i know that this episode was about anakin skywalker and him becoming a jedi knight. i have to admite i didn't think i could ever like any other star wars movie especially if it didn't have mark hamill in it but i was wrong. i love this star wars movie and i'm sure every one else will too.

0786915749|5.0|I read this book late in my life (21) most people read it during their high school years. I bought this book for my boyfriend and ended up getting curious after he started to describe it. This is one of my favorite books of all time <br /> <br />This is the first book in the DragonLance books. There are other books that have come out that explain earlier than this but this is the first one you should read. <br /> <br />You follow a group of unlikely heros...their quest...well save the land of Krynn. Chaos, deceit, love, tragedy, surprises all interwine in this book. <br /> <br />The authors have the greatest way of writing, they make it so you can taste the food, smell the air and see the surroundings all without over killing you with boring details.  <br /> <br />Ive never been into sci fi books but this has changed my mind. You have the clasic make up of unlikey heros. The half elf warrior named Tanis, the unusual twins Raistlin and Camaron, the first being a tortured Mage whos power is just starting and the latter being a high spirited warrior with strength you could dream of. Flint the drarf who is grumpy and adds to the comic side of the story along with bravery and honor. Tas is the kinder, he's the back bone of humor and is so light hearted about all the death and destruction around him that at times you think the poor thing is on drugs but no its the kinder way. Sturm is the kinght and is all you can imagine what one should be, brave, corageous, caring and his one track mind of saving the day. The barbarian star crossed lovers named Goldmoon and Riverwind come from the Plains. She's the chieftans daughter and her love is beneath her in the familys eyes. Together they flee on a personal mission.  <br /> <br />Meeting one night at the Inn the heros worlds clash together whether they like it or not and work together to take down the evil that is planing on taking over Krynn. <br /> <br />Dragons, magic, love, betrayal, blood, guts, swords, crazy old wizards andevil clerics all are included in this fantastic book. Its a must read, You will get hooked :) stick with Wies and Hickman and you'll be alright :) <br /> <br />
0486440915|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the best books written. Ever. I read this book as assigned reading in highschool, and fell in love with it. I was even accused of stealing my copy, which I didn't do by the way- I bought my own.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is so well written, the characters so well drawn, the plot so well planned, and the dialog so quick that I feel any praise I can give it will fall short of the mark. So suffice it to say that if you have somehow not been exposed to Jane Austen by this point in your life, you should IMMEDIATLY invest in a copy of Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />For me this book was a gateway to the wonderful world of Jane Austen novels. Most highly recommened after P&P (by me anyway) would be Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensability. I found Emma and Persuasion interesting enough, but did not love them quite as well as I did the three others. I have yet to read the rest of Jane Austens works, but I most assuredly plan to do so.<br /><br />Anything written by Jane Austen is well worth your time.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Tim Burton takes us through another action-adventure movie!!! Batman was one of the greater superheroes.  He had inner conflicts about his identity that Tim Burton focuses on here in  Batman Returns. What is the perfect villain? The one you can relate to the most! For Batman, it was Catwoman.  The slinky feline is manipulative, but very sympathetic! it was the penguin that completely took all the sympathy.  Tim Burton didn't want you to just hate the villains, he wanted you to understand them. Thus, this is the most creative Batman movie that I have ever seen!  buy this two-disc set! This is worth every penny!
B000BB1MHS|4.0|I really do love to movie. Johnny Depp does a terrific job. There are two things I don't like about the movie. One, the Oompa Loompas. Like in the old movie, the oompa loompas are very boring and the music is terrible. They are too serious. Second is the history and flashbacks. Willy Wonka is supposed to be a mystious character who can't be described. The flashbacks just took away some of Willy Wonka's mystery and weirdness. Other than that, I loved it!
B000005HO0|5.0|The sound, the feel, the look of black metal; never has it been captured in a more perfect light than on Mayhem's 'Live in Leipzig' release. Though originally released in 1993, two years before the original black metal scene reached its pinnacle, its place as a classic album (live or otherwise) still stands to this very day, having been matched by few and topped by none. The production is raw and primitive (two words vastly over-used to describe subsequent black metal albums) allowing Dead's tortured vocals and Euronymous's thrashing and nihilistic riffs to flow from your speakers with such a jagged flair that only a live performance could give. Said production sound is necessary to fully get a feel for the album, simply to hear all of the little nuances in the performances (see Hellhammer's near perfect drum fills that permeate the whole of the album). The exact definition of the genre that Mayhem helped push to the forefront of the metal scene can be found on this album in the form of \\"Freezing Moon\\" (my personal pick for greatest black metal song ever recorded, ever). One listen to the lyrics, the riffs, and the chill inducing guitar solo and you will fully understand exactly what the genre is. 'Live in Leipzig' is easily the pinnacle of the early black metal scene and definitely a true metal masterpiece.<br /><br />10 / 10
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Being a HUGE fan of Buffy and Angel, I had heard of Firefly but never saw the series.  A couple of co-workers finally talked me into giving the series a try over the weekend.  I watched the entire first season, if you can call it a whole season, and loved it.  The next day I saw the Serenity on the big screen and thought it to be one of the best I had seen this year.  FOX!!!  What the heck were you thinking?  Bring this show back!
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I'm a APP fan, I love The Turn of.., Eye in the Sky, On Air, Vulture, Gaudi, etc, but this work is horrendous. After the departure of Woolfson and Bairnson, Alan stayed alone and produced the worst project of all times. There's none that catched me. It seems a techno project, with two old songs. <br />Sorry,  but it must be the end of the project. Go to Porcupine Tree and Marillion.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|First off, I am not some blind a**hole who hates System of a Down. I have been listening to them for over 4 years, and enjoyed almost all their albums (my personal favorite being their debut), so I guess you can say I do have a certain authority to voice my opinion over all these posers who like this nu-metal crap and have only been listening to SOAD for, like, 3 months.     That being said, this album is just not that good. It seems SOAD dropped all their Wacky Metal roots they were known for and just went straight for mainstream, Nu-Metal no different from the likes of, lets say, Atreyu or As I Lay Dying. Now, the album isn't horrible, and it is much heavier and better than most crap nowadays, but this album doesn't live up to the hype. Some songs are catchy, I'll admit, but all the songs seem to be lacking any creativity  whatsoever.    So far, SOAD has had one single (BYOB), an overrated song expressing their hatred to the president. I don't necessarily mind the new theme, and Serj Tankian does have some creative lyrics written down, but the songs-they're just... boring. The musicianship is quite okay. John Dolmayan still drums very good, and has improved (especially with his double bass kicks). Serj's voice still soars well above the music (I've always thought Serj has had an exceptional voice, he's got great range), Daron Malakian has an okay voice, and I don't mind the more vocal time he gets, but he simply has too much time and is nothing compared to Serj. Shavo Odadjian is a mediocre bassist, and he performs well on this album. But then we get to the rest. Daron Malakian - What the f**k happened? He went from an awesome guitarist (If you've ever heard the \\"Spiders\\" solo, you'd get what I mean), down to this. He plays just like all the other Nu-Metal guitarists, three-powerchord riffs played so repetitively that it make me sick, and no solos whatsoever, even though he's perfectly capable of doing so. Now, another part of this album that pisses me off, is thelyrics. Serj has great skill when it comes to writing lyrics, often writing of profound political commentary (much like Rage Against The Machine), and their religion, but the lyrics here are like an angry letter to Hollywood and George Bush, unlike before, where they were so vague and subtle, you didn't know what they meant. Thats what made their music so great, they left the meanings to be up to you. Whatever YOU thought the song meant was what the song meant, and SOAD never contradicted you. But one song in particular that pisses me off is BYOB. I won't get in to my political standpoint, but I'll leave at this: it just plain pisses me off.     There are a few tracks I do like, such as \\"Cigaro\\", \\"Question!\\", and \\"Revenga\\", but the rest is overrated, throwaway material.     Overall, if you are a fan of old Soad (which most of the overexcited 5-star reveiwers here have probably never even heard), don't buy this, for you will most likely be dissapointed like I was. But if you really like this, then go ahead and waste you money on it. Just remember, you're buying into the hype like everybody else. So, go ahead and vote \\"Not Helpful\\", while I am listening to \\"Spiders\\", a great song, while you will be stuck listening to your s**tty little \\"BYOB\\".
B0002SROSQ|5.0|\\"The Boatman's Call\\" was a great album, but it was almost impossible to follow up.  \\"No More Shall We Part\\" and \\"Nocturama\\" had some great moments, but they were essentially disapointing attempts to expand the sound and ideas of \\"Boatman.\\"  Now Nick Cave has finally come out from under the long shadow of \\"The Boatman's Call\\" and you can tell he knows it.  He feels loose and liberated on these two discs and the Bad Seeds play with inspiring power on the most lively and consistent set of songs Cave has ever written.  Abattoir Blues is the more immediately gripping of the two discs.  It's full of revved up garage rock and swampy blues while still retaining many the gorgeous melodies of Cave's more meditative work.  \\"Get Ready For Love,\\" \\"Nature Boy,\\" and \\"There She Goes, My Beautiful World\\" are the three songs that will strike you the most on first listen, with their great lyrics, lightning fast pace, and transcendent choruses.  \\"Hiding All Away\\" might be my favorite song on \\"Abattoir\\" however.  With its crunchy, vaguely funky take on the blues and its surrealist lyrics, it wouldn't sound out of place on an album by prime electric-era Dylan.  That is, until the end where the guitars get noisier, the gospel choir kicks into full gear and Cave leads the Bad Seeds through an apocalyptic rave up like only he knows how. \\"The Lyre Of Orpheus\\" is more mellow, but it has a similarly loose vibe that keeps it from being another \\"Boatman's Call\\" Redux.  Cave is obviously having lots of fun here with the humorous, dramatic title story-song and \\"Babe, You Turn Me On,\\" which functions as the folky flipside to disc one's \\"Nature Boy.\\"  Things get more serious on \\"Carry Me\\" and \\"O Children,\\" but the playing is warm and sympathetic and Cave never sounds dispairing.  This disc's greatest strength is the relaxed violin of Warren Ellis, which sets the tone for Cave's quietly engaging songs. It's rare that and artist approaching middle age, especially one often associated with youthful noise and fury, can create arguably his best album, but that's just what Nick Cave has done with \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre Of Orpheus.\\" Highly recommended for fans and non-fans alike.     <br /> <br />
6305922756|5.0|I don't have to tell you how brilliant this movie is. The same team that made 'Waiting for Guffman' and 'Best in Show' started with this mockumentary about the fictional band Spinal Tap. It's guarenteed to make you laugh, though it's not the real 'here's a joke, now laugh' humor. <br /> <br />This new edition has many special feautures. For starters the menu in the beginning has commentary by the bandmembers which is really funny. Disc 1 also has the entire movie with commentary by the three main band members. Keeping in character however, not really about how the movie was made like so often. It's almost as funny as the movie itself, but best seen late at night after an evening of partying. <br /> <br />Disc 2 is what really makes this DVD worth buying. It has more than an hour worth of outtakes! I don't really get why they took them out because they aren't any less than what ended up in the movie.  <br /> <br />It also has some music videos, TV commercials and a hilarious press conference by the Flower People, the band they were in before Spinal Tap. And throughout the entire DVD they keep in character so I wouldn't be surprised if some people who have trouble grasping the concept of irony will still think it's a real band. <br /> <br />For the real Spinal Tap fans: get this, it's awesome
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I will not comment the story, everyone should know it by now /my opinion:nr.2 is the best of all 3 movies/, let us get to the packaging of this book, I found the design of the first one better, but this second one has a voice chip integrated into the left eye, activated by poking the eye, than a scream comes out at you /similar thing to what Shrek2 had as a Spec.Ed.dvd/. The first book had a pvc seethrough cover with a paper top with description on it, second one comes only in wholesize paper cover, with no seethrough cover. <br />Both books together are scheduled for release Novem./ <br />Decemb.2005 in one paper package /same paper pack. as the second book/ as a gift set edition.  <br />I also recommend you to get a bootleg /30minutes/ of the original short movie WITHIN THE WOODS starring THE CHIN himself Mr.BRUCE CAMPBELL, I got it, the quality of vhs/dvd transfer was poor of course, but still a major thing for the hard deadite fans. <br />The 2005 region2 /United Kingdom/ re - edition of The EVIL DEAD 1 /1982/ - BOOK OF THE DEAD1 was released as a 2dvd set including an extra dvd put alongside with the booklet with a film starring B.Campbell called Running Time /1998/, it had English DD2.0+DD5.1+DTS5.1,no extras. <br />So keep your fingers crossed for The EVIL DEAD 4, Campbell,Tapert and RAIMI should reunite again for this movie, and now Sam Raimi being a Hollywood big shot because of a Spiderman1+2 succes, he should be able to come with a budget that could deliver The BIGGEST Evil Dead EXTRAVAGANZA ever, I would very much like to see a rating on that movie, probably a new classification would be needed. So long ASH fans, enjoy this BOOK OF THE DEAD 2 as it is written on the cover, it is definitely worth buying. One word subscribes it best:GROOVY.
6305897786|4.0|I had to watch it twice.  The first viewing I was too irritated by the unlikely way the supposedly extremely rare and valuable books central to the plot were being handled, being leafed through as if they were ten-a-penny paperbacks.  The distraction caused me to lose track of the plot.  I tried again some months later and really enjoyed the film from start to finish.  The ending is a bit British Hammer Horror flick circa 1960's, but I won't give away the details. <br />   <br />Johnny Depp and Frank Langella are both perfectly cast as Dean Corso and Boris Balkan, and the creepy supernatural undercurrent is crafted into a gripping 133 minutes of storytelling by a director who must be the grand master of the occult genre, Roman Polanski. If you enjoyed Rosemary's Baby  you are sure to enjoy  The Ninth Gate.
B000002UAR|5.0|I wasn't born until well after the Beatles had broken up, so my exposure to their music has all been after-the-fact.  And though I'd often heard of Sgt Pepper's and Abbey Road, rare was the occassion when I would hear any mention of Revolver.  But of the 4 Beatles albums I've heard so far (this one, Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper's, and Let It Be), I like this one the best.  In fact, it's one of the best albums I've ever heard, period. <br /> <br />I've only just begun listening to the Beatles, my interest piqued by hearing an old radio program on the \\"Paul Is Dead\\" hoax which featured some snippets of their later material.  I'm not really into the \\"Beatlemania\\" era stuff, but I love everything from Revolver onward.  This album in particular is superb.  It's very consistent, which to me is very important, but if I had to pick favorites, I'd say that \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", \\"She Said, She Said\\", \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" stand out for me.  Highly, highly recommended.  If you're not a Beatles fan, you just might be after listening to this one.  I've been listening to it almost daily for about a month now.
0778320448|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly with one problem, the repetition at the beginning of chapters - I was so engrossed in the characters I already knew about them and didn't need a recap!  I raced right through this book and then couldn't wait to begin A Good Yarn.  I am looking at other titles for Debbie Macomber.
B000003TAR|5.0|I'll make it short - This is my favourite Nirvana album, and I own them all.<br /><br />For a obsessive fan like me, it is a big deal to say something like that about just one Nirvana album, but it's simply the truth!<br /><br />If you are already a Nirvana fan, then you should most definetely buy this item. If, on the other hand, you're just starting to listen to Nirvana then I recommend Nevermind as a starter, since I started on that one and now Nirvana is my favourite band.<br /><br />In Utero - Nirvana : MAGNIFICENT.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Sorry, but I didn't get through the entire CD and want to return it. I'm probably the only one but, I don't think I've heard anything so violent, evil, negative and vulgar in a long time. Is everyone out there deaf??
015626224X|5.0|I'm not a huge George Orwell fan, I think 1984 is genius, and I thought Burmese Days was good, but I didn't like Animal Farm much.  I thought the symbolism was far too obvious, and I much prefer obscured meaning to outright political satire.  That was my experience with Orwell (aside from a couple essays I read of his from the World War II era in which he basically defended British firebombing).<br /><br />Then this year someone recommnded \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\", and I picked it up on Amazon.  It is every bit as good as 1984, and involves some of his best descriptive detail.  The details and accuracy here are amazing, and most of it would remain true for the poor in America today as it was for an Englishman in Paris in the early 20th century.  Aside from the fact that Paris dominates the narrative - maybe it should be called \\"Down and Out in Paris (and London)\\", this is an overlooked piece of great literature.<br /><br />For background on Orwell before his \\"poor in Europe\\" period, I recommend \\"Finding George Orwell in Burma\\" which is also a very good piece of journalism from modern-day Burma.
B00008EY7H|4.0|I went to Alegria when they came to Miami and I think the DVD does not transmit the magic of the performance. Although I really liked the DVD, I thought they could cut some parts and add some others. If you are a Cirque fan, definitelly you should buy it. But if not, try Drallion or La Nouba instead.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|I saw this wrestlemania last year at a friend's house on pay-per-view. When it came out on dvd, I immediately bought it, Being that i wanted to own this show so bad. This show was quite good and the only reason i don't give it that 5th star is because of the extreme dissapointment that came with the Goldberg-Lesnar match. Anyway, Here's my opinions on all the matches of this card:    1. For the WWE U.S. title  Champion The big show vs. John cena  This was a bad way to start the show. The match was boring and the moves weren't really that impressive at all. Skip this match. As interesting as Cena's raps are, It's just too bad that he isn't that good of a wrestler. In fact, I'm still waiting to see a match from Cena that's better than his debut wwe match he had against kurt angle on an episode of smackdown back in 2002. Cena wins the u.s. title from the big show. It's amazing that at the very next wrestlemania, Which took place this year, John Cena would become the wwe champion. *1/2    2. Fatal 4 way match for the WWE world tag team titles  Champions Booker T & Rob Van Dam Vs. The Dudley Boyz Vs. La Resistance Vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade  This match was ok. This match did feature some great action from RVD and it is an improvement over the opening match. It's watchable. Booker & RVD retain the tag titles in this one. ***1/2    3. Chris Jericho Vs. Christian   Oh man! Why was this great match put on so early? This match was filled with excitement and great action. Both Jericho and Christian did an awesome job with this match and this is certainly one of the best matches on this show. Christian wins in a very shocking way. *****    4. 3 on 2 handicap match  The Rock n sock Connection vs. Evolution [Randy Orton, Ric Flair, & Batista]  The Rock and Mick Foley reunited their tag team to take on evolution last year. Well, This match was alright. At least i was able to make it through this match without falling asleep and i take that into consideration a lot. Evolutionwon when Randy Orton pinned Mick Foley following an RKO. Batista would go on to become the world champion at this year's wrestlemania. Randy Orton became the world champion just months later at last year's summerslam when he defeated Chris Benoit, Who would win the world title later on in the main event of this show. ***    5. Playboy Evening Gown match  Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Kiebler & Miss Jackie  If you seen one evening gown match, You've seen them all. Skip. Sable & Torrie won, But i don't think nobody really cared. No stars    6. Cruiserweight Open Invitational match  Champion Chavo Guerrero Vs. Billy Kidman Vs. Rey Mysterio Vs. Ultimo Dragon Vs. Nunzio Vs. Shannon Moore Vs. Tajiri Vs. Jamie Knoble Vs. Akio Vs. Funaki  Now this is what i'm talking about! This match was very exciting and it had many great impressive high flying moves to really catch a wrestling fan's attention. These 9 cruiserweights really did a great job with this match. Full of great fast-paced high flying action, This match is a definite highlight of this wrestlemania. Chavo retains the title with help from his father, Chavo sr. I would've liked it even more if Mysterio Or Kidman or Tajiri won this match, But oh well, This match is already excellent as it is! *****    7. Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar  Special Referee: Stone Cold Steve Austin  This was 1 of the matches i looked forward to seeing at this wrestlemania. Unfortunately, This match really failed to live up to its hype. The match went far too slow and let's face it, There was absolutely no reason for these 2 guys to stay in a tie up for over 4 minutes!!! There was very limited action in this match and if you haven't seen this match but wanna see this match, Don't bother. Trust me, This match is nowhere near as good as you probably are expecting it to be. 2nd worst match on this event. Only reason this even gets a star is because it's better than that stupid evening gown match that took place earlier. Other than that, A big waste of time. Unfortunately, This was the last night that either of these guys appeared in the WWE. What a dissapointing end to both of these guys wrestling careers. Goldberg won. *    8. Fatal 4 way match for the WWE world tag team titles  Champions Scotty 2 hotty & Rikishi Vs. The Acolytes Vs. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas vs. The basham brothers  This match was decent. It wasn't as good as raw's fatal 4 way tag match, But hey, It was WAY better than that last match before it. Scotty & Rikishi retain the tag titles in this match. 1 thing that is unbelievable is that Bradshaw would win the wwe world title just a few months later after this match. **1/2    9. For the WWE women's title  Champion Victoria Vs. Molly Holly  This match was watchable to say the least. It's better than most women's matches that take place in the WWE today and to be able to say that, That's enough for me to give this match an average rating. Victoria retains the belt and as a stipulation, Molly's Hair gets shaved. **1/2    10. For the WWE world title  Champion Eddie Guerrero Vs. Kurt Angle  This was a great match! Two of the best wrestlers in the WWE today put on an awesome match. The action was very impressive, It was fast-paced, The wrestling was very unpredictable, And the match was never boring. These 2 always put on a good show when they're in the ring against each other. If you're a fan of either of these guys, You should most definitely watch this match. I guarantee you will love it. Even has an awesome ending courtesy of Guerrero. Guerrero retains the title. ***** [Best match on the event]    11. The Undertaker Vs. Kane  This match wasn't really that good. It was too one-sided and it was a little too short. I was only able to get through this match with ease because it was the return of The Undertaker, Who's 1 of my all-time favorites. **1/2    12. Triple Threat Match for the World Title  Champion Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Chris Benoit  This was a great main event. The wrestling was good, The match wasn't no longer than what it needed to be, And something that was long overdue finally happened at the end of this match. This match was very entertaining and all 3 of the wrestlers in this match gave it their all. This match never got boring and the more it went on, The more i anticipated its ending. To my [And hopefully, Many fans] Delight, Benoit forced Triple H to tap out to the crossface and he finally became the world title. You can really tell that Benoit truly wanted that belt, Being that he even went as far as to cry at the end of this match. And it was quite an emotional moment when Benoit And Guerrero hugged each other and cryed together as the world champions of the WWE. It's a shame that they had to lose their belts to Randy Orton and Bradshaw. These 2 guys should have, In my opinion, spent the rest of last year as champions. An awesome main event and a great way to end this show. *****    All in all, This was a good wrestlemania. Right about now, This wrestlemania and all the other wrestlemanias can be found in a box set that was just released by the WWE. You have 2 choices, You can buy the entire box set which has all of the first 21 wrestlemanias, and believe me, That box set is extremely expensive, or You can take the cheaper, Smarter way out and buy the box set by individual 5-set volumes [Which cost about $50-60 a piece]. This wrestlemania was great. WWE fans should like this wrestlemania a lot. Well, I hope my review helped. Be blessed.
0307236722|5.0|I love baked goods and I have said before that I could eat my way through a bakery.  Although I am a very tallented cook, I have struggled with baking my own sweets.  Deserts in my house were usually purchased and rarely homemade.  I intend on changing that with this book!      Martha and her staff have put together a fantastic collection of baking recipes, and not just deserts either.  There are other great things in this book including pizza dough, quick breads, and yeast breads.  The instructions are easy to understand and the photographs are beautiful (I'd eat the book if I could).  There is an extensive section of photographs and explainations of specific tools that are handy to have when baking.  Every page is filled with valuable information.    It is my challenge to make each and every one of these recipes.  I'll try a new one every weekend, if not more often, until I finish.  By that time I am certain I'll be the one my friends call on for desert or fresh baked bread, and I won't have to buy my pies any longer.  Thanks Martha, you are truly a \\"Good Thing\\"!    PS- I have already made the \\"pistachio cranberry biscotti\\" and they are fantastic!
B0002IQMKM|2.0|I know - you can't please everybody.      I'd like to buy a Talking Heads 'greatest hits' compilation because I do love a lot of their songs, but I don't particularly want to buy a 2CD or Box set just so I can have all of the songs I want.  They've got a lot of songs that, frankly, I don't care for.      And this collection almost made me break out my credit card.  But there are a few songs missing, and maybe someone thought they didn't constitute a \\"hit.\\"  \\"Radiohead\\" is one.  Also, for die-hard fans, there were two versions of a fantastic \\"B\\" side song called \\"Hey Now.\\"  If you can find it, it's a real treasure, and I defy anyone not to get the simple chorus stuck in their head for the rest of the day.    Someone else accurately pointed out \\"Love For Sale\\" was also not on here.  Great song, and video, but it's missing in action here.  And you can't tell me that TH fans didn't love \\"Stay Up Late\\" from the \\"Little Creatures\\" album!  I don't know if it was a hit, but it had a music video (remember they were all flying around on those harnesses wearing the white suits) and was (and still is) played a lot on the radio.    I'm sorry if the record industry is complaining about file sharing.  But what choice do they give us when they constantly neglect to put together collections themselves which are complete?  Give us what we want, then everybody will be happy - they'll get our money, and we'll get the exact product that we want.  They have the capability to do that, but they won't, so the downloading will continue.
B000001EAQ|5.0|What the hell is wrong with this stunning delight? <br /> <br />Fans who were old enough (like me) to live their euphoric 90s were witnessi of something huge. Pop is in many ways a much darker record than any of the other band's work. <br /> <br />U2 in the 90s was one of the most inventive modern musical bands, bringing astonishing live experiences as Zoo TV and PopMart Tour. Who the hell care if this album sold just one million copies in the US? <br /> <br />Sadly U2 were so much worried about that situation and then they sold out with ATYCLB, and they still insist with that light weight music formula with HTDAAB. Both are extremely unfocused  Since ATYCAB, there has been no build, no progression, no real drama, just sunglasses, commercials and a muddle of sameness. <br /> <br />Pop really deserves a reconsideration by Bono and his lads
B0006L16N8|3.0|X+Y is a decent album, but I find it a disappointment after the terrific \\"Rush\\".  Basically, the only song I like is \\"Speed of Sound\\", which has received extensive radio play.  The other songs lack strong melodies.    \\"Parachutes\\" was a pleasant debut album with one outstanding song- \\"Yellow\\".  \\"Rush\\" was a terrific follow-up with lots of radio-friendly songs, and is primarily responsible for Coldplay's large following.  X+Y by contrast lacks any real radio-friendly songs except for \\"Speed\\"... I for one have never understood why being \\"commerical\\" is considered bad by some critics...but those are probably the only people who'll like X+Y.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 are tainting their stellar reputation with this crap.  <br /> <br />U2's old tricks are still present here, sounded even more outdated than ATYCLB: The epic production, Edge's trademark guitar, Bono's ballads, mid tempo songs, their long time friends producing it, a short and silly \\"rock\\" number as opener, Joshua Tree remainders, etc. <br /> <br />U2 prefer to keep their focus (I mean, unfocused career) on the here and now. That's a good thing for those who prefer the current, blander and sellout U2. But the rest of the U2 masses have basically written them off. They just evaporate into nothing. <br /> <br />The sound of this album ends up, despite the \\"punk\\" ipod jingle Vertigo, being flat and insipid.  <br /> <br />I can't believe the former avant garde band of the 90s now remain unchanged: they're still unspeakably numb. The tunes are repetitive and lack dynamics. Where's the talent here? this crap contain the laziest tricks in the songwriter's canons <br /> <br />Listen to Mofo and then listen to any 00s \\"rock\\" number... <br />in the 90s U2 were truly artful, but since ATYCLB something genuinely dreadful has been killing their minds of musicians into vulgar businessmen.  <br /> <br />And meanwhile they still keep bashing Zooropa and Pop and glorifying Beautiful Day, appearing as one hit wonders and dinosaurs. <br /> <br />...Looking for a sound that's going drown out the world...  <br /> <br />
B00097DXZS|1.0|I totally agree with all the negative comments about this release. <br /> <br />Quite annoyed that it cannot be played on my P.C. or portable cd player. <br /> <br />My copy will end up at the used cd store.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Many fans of the 1971 Gene Wilder classic will find themselves picking at similiarities in this re-telling of Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.  Though Tim Buton claimed not to be an admirer of the original, I believe either he or Depp studied up on Wilder's performance.  Closer to the book than the original, there are still certain nuances, certain catch phrases that were not garnered from the book.  Depp's Wonka is a little bit scarier, a little more messed up than the Wilder version.  You get the feeling in places that he and Hannibal Lecter might get along together...Depp is that creepy in places, almost too emotionally damaged.  Overall a stunning Burton vision if there ever was one.  A little predictable...duh?  Is Depp classic here?  Yes.  Is it better than the original?  That's the million dollar question.  Childhood nostalgia clouds the answer for me.  My kids loved it and they love the old one, too.  Score there.  Overall, I enjoyed it tremendously.  Depp's over-the-top performances are always fun to watch.<br /><br />Dig it!
6305922756|5.0|Just wanted to add my 2 cents to the many quotes, etc., from TIST that are among my favorites - I haven't seen these noted by the other reviewers: <br /> <br />1) Cameo:  Julie Hagerty (Airplane, Lost In America, Freddie Got Fingered) is one of the squealing fans who accosts Duke Fame in the Memphis hotel lobby. <br /> <br />2) David:  Have you seen Duke Fame's latest album? <br />   Ian:  Uh, yes. <br />   David: Have you seen the cover? <br />   Ian:  Uh, no. <br /> <br />3) Nigel:  It seems that Sex Farm is a hit in Japan. <br />   Derek:  Spinal Tap's version of Sex Farm? <br />   Nigel:  Yes.
B00000DOY9|5.0|Presence (1976.), Led Zeppelin's seventh studio album<br /><br />When people consider Led Zeppelin's great albums, the list more than often contains Led Zeppelin I, II and IV or Physical Graffiti. Presence, the 1976 offering from the band rarely gets a mention alongside these classics. Hastily recorded in the aftermath of the huge success of the double album, Physical Graffiti, Presence has become one of the band's more criticised and sometimes forgotten works. However, is this a fairly passed judgment on Led Zeppelin's Presence?<br /><br />In my opinion, this is easily Led Zeppelin's most unfairly attacked album and it deserves far more praise than it has been given. It never ceases to amaze me why this album is given such a bad press by most people; they describe 'Presence' as the album were Led Zeppelin lost their touch or they just brandish it as incoherant rubbish. All I can gather from this is that these people haven't listened to the work enough or are just one of the old 'so called' Led Zeppelin fans. 'Presence' is a great hard rock record, displaying some of the band's best jams. It is unique in the respect that it features no keyboard or effects; all the sound you hear is vocal, bass, guitar and drums. However, I think this is no bad thing at all. The fact that the band took a calculated step back after Physical Graffiti and tried something not too overambitous is where Presence really succeeds. The song styles are simpler in many respects but at the same time they are driven by very powerful performances from the band members. Afterall, this is Jimmy Page's favourite Led Zeppelin record and you can clearly see why he enjoys this one; his guitar playing is dynamic and inspired throughout. Furthermore, this album features some killer tracks. 'Achilles Last Stand', perhaps the band's greatest epic, features on this album, as does the fan favourite 'Nobody's Fault But Mine'. The album may have been rushed together, recorded in limited time in Germany but to be honest, the music is first rate and deserves five stars all the way. Even more remarkable is Plant's vocal performance on the album; at the time of recording, he was recovering from a car accident and had to actually sing some parts laid down. His vocals are as compelling as ever though.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin kick off their hard-rocking seventh album with one of their finest tracks. 'Achilles Last Stand' stands as one of the bands most powerful epics. In fact, this 10 minute track alone is worth the price of admission, led by its unwavering groove, a particularly haunting Plant vocal, and several show stopping give and take segments between Page and Bonham. During these thrilling exchanges, Bonham's volcanic drum fills interlock with Page's wailing guitar parts, seizing several moments of tension that build to the bursting point. This awesome opening track is followed by 'For Your Life'. This is classic Zeppelin, and for me another one of their best songs. I can never tire of this song; the strutting riffs from Page's guitar make this song memorable. Plant gives a vintage performance on the vocals, sounding out lyrics about drug taking. Next up though is perhaps the weakest song on the album; still 'Royal Orleans' ain't that bad a song. Plant gives a lyrical take on one night stands, a classic rock n' roll song theme however the melodic backing of the track and the riffs are a bit repetitive. However, at 3 minutes, this weaker track hardly detracts from the albums overall rating.<br /><br />Then we come to the second half of the album. Robert Plant, whose voice has grown rougher over the years, gives a compelling, stuttered vocal performance on 'Nobody's Fault But Mine', an excellent, hard rocking song. This one is a fan favourite. The song also makes a welcome return of the harmonica to Led Zeppelin's music. 'Candy Store Rock' follows, with some catchy guitar play from Page that has a very 1950's rock n' roll sound to it. 'Hots On For Nowhere' follows and keepsthe blood pumping on the album. Many have passed this song off as filler however, I think it's a great song. It's upbeat, has masterful stop-start riffs and some great harmonisation sections, with a 'la, la, la' chorus with funky backbeats. To finish the album is a welcome return to the blues by Led Zeppelin. 'Tea For One' is in a similar vein to 'Since I've Bin Loving You' from LZ III. A little long and drawn out, nevertheless, Plant gives a resounding vocal performance and Page's guitar virtuousity shines through.<br /><br />All in all, 'Presence' measures up to be a damned good album. True, this album isn't revolutionary, it isn't experimental but the sheer quality of the hard rock songs on the album makes the work a winner. As a seasoned Led Zeppelin fan, 'Presence' has over time become one of the band's works that I listen to more; I would even on some days, place this album in the league of some of the band's earlier work. 'Presence' is a sadly underrated classic album from the great band and many seem to ignore it. My advice is to not start a Led Zeppelin collection with this album, but certainly to obtain it once you really start getting into the band's music. This is Led Zeppelin's last classic album and it deserves some RESPECT!<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10bum. Many have passed this song off as filler however, I think it's a great song.

B000B0WODA|5.0|I liked Franz Ferdinand's self-titled debut album but it seemed to me that the band was sometimes so focused on playing up their campy image that it detracted from the music (e.g., the ridiculous German vocals on \\"Darts of Pleasure\\").    On \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" the band has realized their potential. Their songwriting range has expanded greatly and now seems to draw inspiration from the '60s as much as the '80s (especially \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" and the Kinksy \\"What You Meant\\"). And the warmer production makes for a much more satisfying listen then the excessively harsh debut.    Sharper songwriting + better production - campy theatrics = a much stronger showing than \\"Franz Ferdinand.\\" This is one of the best albums of 2005 and I'm looking forward to even more growth on future discs.
B000002JSP|4.0|In Through The Out Door (1979.), Led Zeppelin's eighth studio album<br /><br />Led Zeppelin, through the course of the 1970's, established themselves as the biggest rock n' roll band in the world. Classic albums such as Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy were massive hits, selling records in their thousands. However, problems were to hit the band in the 2 years after the release of Presence, in 1976. The death of Plant's son Karac in 1977 put a stop to any touring and any imminent studio recording and also, Jimmy Page's drug addiction reached it peak during this time, and his usual musical creative output became minimal. However, by late 1978, the band were stable enough to gather material and begin recording their new album, which took place at the Polar Studios in Sweden. The resulting album from this was 'In Through The Out Door'. As with any Led Zeppelin album, the album sold very well however, it was met by a mixed response which has led to it being one of the band's more criticised albums.<br /><br />'In Through The Out Door' is a significant departure from the band's musical stylings that came before it. However, it is because of this that we must consider the band in perspective. With Page's output being much less for this album, the band needed a new songwriter to step to the fore. This appeared in the form of John Paul Jones. Co-writing all but one of the songs, he gives the songs major keyboard presence and was quick to experiment with synthesizers, with mixed results. In some areas, it works excellently well, such as in 'In The Evening' and 'South Bound Suarez' however at the same time it has its bloated moments in 'Carouselambra' and wares a bit thin later on in the album. Still though, 'In Through The Out Door' is still a great album which saw the veteran rock band keeping pace with the new generation of punk upstarts by ironically toning things down. The album is typical latter career Zeppelin in terms of experimentation. The band were quick to use synthesizers and also try out different styles such as a Latin beat in 'Fool In The Rain'. There are weak aspects to this album but at the same time it has plenty of great moments and you have to take your hat off to the band for trying new things. Plant's vocals and indeed his lyrical writing is strong throughout, JP Jones has major roles on most songs, Bonham's drumming is awesome and Page's guitar play, albeit muted in parts, still has great moments.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin's final album begins with what for me is the strongest track on the work and one of the band's best songs. The eerie opening to 'In The Evening' with guitar swirl is brilliant and it leads into a classic rock song. Plant's cocky vocals, aimed at letting the 'punk pretenders' know who was boss are apt for the song. JP Jones' keyboard use gives the song a bright and powerful tone and Page's riffing is great on this song. His solo is brilliant; he makes his guitar sound like a motorbike starting up in parts - phemoninal.! Following this great track is 'South Bound Suarez' which is an upbeat piano styled rocker with plenty of great harmonies. 'Fool In The Rain' follows; a bit commercial and poppy, this is none the less a great catchy tune. The Latin beat is great and the section where the music breaks into some kind of tango is clever. Bonham's drumming is worth a listen on the song also. Closing the first half of the album is perhaps the works weakest track in 'Hot Dog'. An interesting rocker-billy styled song that I can only listen to every so often.<br /><br />Opening the second half of the album is the epic 'Carouselambra'. This 10 minute track is a little more low-key than past epics and the synthesizer does get a bit bloated. Still, its a very good song in parts with some diverse sections and an atmospheric part with some shreiking guitar work from Page. Still though, you feel as though this track could have been cut down by at least 3 minutes. Next is Plant's tribute song to his dead sonwith 'All Of My Love'. The style is somewhat smaltzy, due to the keyboard intergration but on the whole the band's style is beautifully understated and Plant's vocals are heartfelt. The synthesizers continue with 'I'm Gonna Crawl'. A slow and bluesy performance with some more powerful Plant vocals. Again, a lot of synthesizer although it works pretty well in this track.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good album from Led Zeppelin. A few experimental slips but a great effort none the less. Still though, Led Zeppelin's new sound was distinctly slicker and more understated than on previous albums. No-one new at the time, but this was to be the band's last album, with the tragic death from asphyxiation of drummer genius John Bonham a year later. Not desiring to carry on after his death, the remaining members disbanded. Resulting from this, the band left an untarnished musical legacy and they didn't linger on past their prime (although had they continued, I reckon they would still have had some more classic material in the can!). 'In Through The Out Door' is a great swan-song for the band and one they should be by no means ashamed of. Not the place to start for a Led Zeppelin newbie, this album is reccomeded to any fan of the band looking for more.<br /><br />MY RATING: 7.5/10is somewhat smaltzy, due to the keyboard intergration but on the whole the band's style is beautifully understated and Plant's vocals are heartfelt.

0553801503|2.0|As a person who normally gallops through reading material as part of my job, I luxuriate in hearing the occasional book that's worth the time to listen to slowly.  Hearing a book gives me time to absorb all of the details, to picture each scene and facial expression, and to immerse myself in the world of the writer.  Listening to Roy Dotrice made the many hours spent listening to the first three books sing.  I couldn't wait to hear what happened to each person -- not each character, but each individual.  I do hope Random House has the good sense to redo this book with Roy and make sure that he does the later volumes as well -- even if it holds up the release.  John Lee reads some books well.  This is just NOT one of them.  Please get Roy back!!!!
B00005JAVQ|5.0|Presence (1976.), Led Zeppelin's seventh studio album<br /><br />When people consider Led Zeppelin's great albums, the list more than often contains Led Zeppelin I, II and IV or Physical Graffiti. Presence, the 1976 offering from the band rarely gets a mention alongside these classics. Hastily recorded in the aftermath of the huge success of the double album, Physical Graffiti, Presence has become one of the band's more criticised and sometimes forgotten works. However, is this a fairly passed judgment on Led Zeppelin's Presence?<br /><br />In my opinion, this is easily Led Zeppelin's most unfairly attacked album and it deserves far more praise than it has been given. It never ceases to amaze me why this album is given such a bad press by most people; they describe 'Presence' as the album were Led Zeppelin lost their touch or they just brandish it as incoherant rubbish. All I can gather from this is that these people haven't listened to the work enough or are just one of the old 'so called' Led Zeppelin fans. 'Presence' is a great hard rock record, displaying some of the band's best jams. It is unique in the respect that it features no keyboard or effects; all the sound you hear is vocal, bass, guitar and drums. However, I think this is no bad thing at all. The fact that the band took a calculated step back after Physical Graffiti and tried something not too overambitous is where Presence really succeeds. The song styles are simpler in many respects but at the same time they are driven by very powerful performances from the band members. Afterall, this is Jimmy Page's favourite Led Zeppelin record and you can clearly see why he enjoys this one; his guitar playing is dynamic and inspired throughout.

B00005JNTX|2.0|Film goir maybe. Frank Miller, author of the source graphic novels, was seduced into green-lighting the movie and settled for something even shallower than his graphic novels. I wish he had boned up on Rodriguez' previous film history before getting compromised in this first-person-shooter computer-game of a movie.  But now that Sin City-1 has paid the bills, maybe the sequel will try to aim a little higher.     Pros:  1. Stunning hyper-noir black and white visuals    Cons:  1. Strict fidelity to the graphic novels - comic book stereotypes masquerading as noir protagonists  2. Non-existant Sin City backstory - no depth at all to the weak screenplay  3. Stylized, but endless and numbing ultra-violence including cannibalism, castration and suicide  4. Acting talent wasted with hip, cliche-dominated dialogue  5. Five-minute Tarantino segment embarassing parody of his neo-noir film work.  6. Way too little content to sustain a 2-hour plus movie.  7. Humorless    Conclusion: Boring and irritating waste of potentially exciting noir visuals.

0064407667|4.0|<br />The Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning <br />This book is about how 3 children, the Baudelaire's are on the beach. A mysterious figure comes and says to them that their house had burned down and both of their parents had died. The man that had come was Mr. Poe the Baudelaire's bank manager and the person who looks over the Baudelaire's Fortune. Mr. Poe is also in charge of placing the Baudelaire kids in a new home. Mr. Poe has picked Count Olaf to be there new guardian he is either there third cousin four times removed, or the fourth cousin three times removed. The only reason Mr. Poe but them with him was because he was the closest geographically. So after they get there things they go to Count Olaf house. He has a tower at the top which the kids are not allowed in. In the house there are many bedrooms but the Baudelaire's only get one room. And they only get 1 bed. Cont Olaf and his acting crew have a plan to steal the Baudelaire fortune. They plan to have Count Olaf marry Violet, one of the Baudelaire kids. So now the Baudelaire's must find a way to fool Count Olaf's plot. Read the book to find out how or if the Baudelaire's escape. <br /> <br /> This book was very exciting to read because after the Baudelaire's had found out a way to fix one problem Count Olaf would put another on them making for there to almost always be a lot of action. I was not able to really feel like I was in the book because the Baudelaire's were in such bad conditions. That made it very to image that I was \\"in\\" the book. The main conflict interested me a lot because there were so many main plots. They would find out one thing then have to figure out how to get past another thing. It was very exciting and just the thought of having to find a way to not get married. If I was Violet I would be so scared I wouldn't be able to handle it. The characters in this book were very realistic. Violet and Klaus are both around my age and this could have definitely happened by somecruel evil person. The only one that wasn't so real was sunny because the Baudelaire's said that they could understand her when she said things like hausdasnd.  The books end was very satisfying and very enjoyable because the author always had a new problem for the Baudelaire's and somehow they always got passed it and in the end the Baudelaire's somehow get away but Count Olaf also gets away which was kind of disappointing. <br /> <br />  <br /> I think the author did a good job with the book overall. The author's voice was trying to get straight to the point and wouldn't use too many exclamation marks or anything. The author's vocabulary was very interesting especially when Count Olaf was talking he would try and act very sophisticated. But they would use the word wrong. When the author was having Count Olaf talk when he was alone he was very evil and mean. And when he was around other people he would be the nicest person you've ever met. Also he used a lot of metaphors and similes to \\"spice\\" up his already beautifully horrible writing. I loved how the author really had made a personality for all of the characters. The author used a lot of dialogue usually between the Baudelaire's. This was always very interesting dialogue about how to escape from Count Olaf. Also I loved how the theater troupe talked in such a sophisticated way but they were so stupid. The author's described things with ok detail but I wish he had described thing a little bit more. <br /> <br /> I think book is a pretty easy read and is very enjoyable for all ages. This is more for the people that like adventure books and books that may be a little bit unpleasant. I have read some of the other books in this series and you have to read this one in order to understand the rest. And this book is a little bit worse then the others. But overall I would give this book 8 out of 10 because it's an easy but very fun read. It also had lots of dialogue and the author made he book so much fun to read. So I recommend this book to people who want an easy read and a book that you won't want to put down. <br /> <br /> I think this book was great but could've used a little bit more description. And I think this was just kind of weird that in the beginning of the book the author had about 3 pages telling about how horrible this book is and that you should stop reading it. Also I think it is cool that all of his books are like this The Bad Beginning. Having the first letter of word and second letter of second word the same. Or like the Hostile Hospital etc... Overall this was a very good book and I think everybody should read it regardless of age. <br /> <br />

Still though, 'In Through The Out Door' is still a great album which saw the veteran rock band keeping pace with the new generation of punk upstarts by ironically toning things down. The album is typical latter career Zeppelin in terms of experimentation. The band were quick to use synthesizers and also try out different styles such as a Latin beat in 'Fool In The Rain'. There are weak aspects to this album but at the same time it has plenty of great moments and you have to take your hat off to the band for trying new things. Plant's vocals and indeed his lyrical writing is strong throughout, JP Jones has major roles on most songs, Bonham's drumming is awesome and Page's guitar play, albeit muted in parts, still has great moments.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin's final album begins with what for me is the strongest track on the work and one of the band's best songs. The eerie opening to 'In The Evening' with guitar swirl is brilliant and it leads into a classic rock song. Plant's cocky vocals, aimed at letting the 'punk pretenders' know who was boss are apt for the song. JP Jones' keyboard use gives the song a bright and powerful tone and Page's riffing is great on this song. His solo is brilliant; he makes his guitar sound like a motorbike starting up in parts - phemoninal.! Following this great track is 'South Bound Suarez' which is an upbeat piano styled rocker with plenty of great harmonies. 'Fool In The Rain' follows; a bit commercial and poppy, this is none the less a great catchy tune. The Latin beat is great and the section where the music breaks into some kind of tango is clever. Bonham's drumming is worth a listen on the song also. Closing the first half of the album is perhaps the works weakest track in 'Hot Dog'. An interesting rocker-billy styled song that I can only listen to every so often.<br /><br />Opening the second half of the album is the epic 'Carouselambra'. This 10 minute track is a little more low-key than past epics and the synthesizer does get a bit bloated. Still, its a very good song in parts with some diverse sections and an atmospheric part with some shreiking guitar work from Page. Still though, you feel as though this track could have been cut down by at least 3 minutes. Next is Plant's tribute song to his dead sonwith 'All Of My Love'. The style is somewhat smaltzy, due to the keyboard intergration but on the whole the band's style is beautifully understated and Plant's vocals are heartfelt. The synthesizers continue with 'I'm Gonna Crawl'. A slow and bluesy performance with some more powerful Plant vocals. Again, a lot of synthesizer although it works pretty well in this track.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good album from Led Zeppelin. A few experimental slips but a great effort none the less. Still though, Led Zeppelin's new sound was distinctly slicker and more understated than on previous albums. No-one new at the time, but this was to be the band's last album, with the tragic death from asphyxiation of drummer genius John Bonham a year later. Not desiring to carry on after his death, the remaining members disbanded. Resulting from this, the band left an untarnished musical legacy and they didn't linger on past their prime (although had they continued, I reckon they would still have had some more classic material in the can!). 'In Through The Out Door' is a great swan-song for the band and one they should be by no means ashamed of. Not the place to start for a Led Zeppelin newbie, this album is reccomeded to any fan of the band looking for more.<br /><br />MY RATING: 7.5/10is somewhat smaltzy, due to the keyboard intergration but on the whole the band's style is beautifully understated and Plant's vocals are heartfelt.

0316666343|4.0|The thought-provoking novel that is `The Lovely Bones' pokes and prods at the concept of life after death, but even more importantly, the lives that continue after a death.  <br /> <br />The story introduces us to Susie Salmon, a 14 year old girl who is trapped in her childhood after being brutally raped and murdered by George Harvey, an unusual man who lives on her street. Susie narrates the story from her Heaven, where she watches the day to day lives of the people who were most important to her, as they grapple with her murder and move on with their ever-changing lives and grow-up, something which Susie never had or will have the chance to do.  <br /> <br />The book delves into the lives of her family and friends as they attempt to move on and the colossal effect her death has on them as they struggle to stay together. From one character's affair, to the unexpected arrival of an eccentric Grandmother and the intriguing obsession a school acquaintance develops the book explores the ways in which each character deals with the tragic loss. All this is explained through the eyes of a young girl watching those she most cared about live the life that she never would, making it an even more fascinating read. It is about her watching her family's struggles as they try to move on, when she herself can't.  <br /> <br />As well as this is the ongoing sub-plot involving her killer, a disturbing neighbor, as he attempts to remain one step ahead of the police, and struggles to keep ahead of the Salmon family as Susie's sister and father determinedly pursue him refusing to sway in their belief that he is guilty. The story then looks at the depressing life that he brought on himself after he is forced to leave his home due to the suspicion of others. <br /> <br />But in spite of all this and the events that take place, the book does not have an entirely gloomy outlook, but rather displays the optimism, if at times nave, of a 14 year old girl. Although the desperate longing forher family is always underlying, the book does not have the depressed demeanor about it that you might expect.   <br /> <br />`The Lovely Bones' is no piece of light reading, but rather a complex and deep examination of a family dealing with loss, and how it is viewed by a teenager, specifically the one who's life was cruelly taken. It is a story about overcoming loss, despite how hard it is to do just that. Its extensive mixture of characters and its many minor storylines will intrigue and interest you to the end, as you can't help but get involved in the daily struggle that is their lives, as you put yourself in the position of the characters.  <br /> <br />In short-read it, or you're truly missing out.
0380820846|5.0|This is the first Julia Quinn novel I've read. I like the fact that she doesn't dwell so much on the lovemaking part. Some romance authors tend to exaggerate that. As a long-time romance reader, I prefer dialogues & interactions between the characters. <br /> <br />As for Romancing Mr. Bridgeton, I like the fact that Ms. Quinn made Penelope seem so normal. Some novels tend to exaggerate the beauty of their heroines. Also, their was constant, humorous movement in the novel. Overall, I like it & I'll recommend it to my friends.
B000A88F22|5.0|This show defines what reality TV should be....REAL.  it chronicles britneys life on tour and meeting her current husband.  sure she is immature at times and really goofy, but that is what makes it good.  she really is a down to earth normal person with a great sense of humor.  she doesn't care that she is on film and speaks what is on her mind.  there is no way this could have been scripted like newleyweds.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|The end-of-the-year \\"festivities\\" are not my bag.  In fact, they make me more than a little crazy.  But I DO like holiday music, and were it not for my Christmas CD collections from Peggy Lee, Natalie Cole, and The Manhattan Transfer, I might not survive 'til New Year's Eve.  I keep my holiday discs stashed away in a closet, then pull them out around Thanksgiving time.  However, Diana's new \\"Christmas Songs\\" will be kept out, front and center, year-round, along with all my other DK recordings.  This collection is an open window, full of brisk, fresh air.  The arrangements (and of course, Diana's playing) are effervescent, swingy jazz, and they make me feel like I'm in a New York penthouse, happily getting ready for a party full of interesting guests.  Yes, the selections are all warhorse oldies, but like everything she touches, Lady Di's intimate, Scotch-and-honey vocals, and her ingenious phrasing, make them unmistakably all her own.  DK does an especially exceptional version of Judy Garland's \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" with her great improvised keyboard intro, and at least there are two unique gems thrown into the mix: the delightful, gentle \\"Christmastime Is Here\\" (from \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\") and the gracious, sensitive \\"Count Your Blessings\\" which closes the set.<br /><br />As for the provocative cover photo of Mrs. Costello sprawled legs akimbo, in high heels and a hiked-up green satin dress, all I can say is it made me laugh out loud! I'm sure Diana is laughing, too: all the way to the bank.  Others assertions that the gal is talked into these poses by her PR people, as though she were some naive, blonde bimbo, is silly.  Diana is smart enough to know great music, and she's smart enough to know how to sell it.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna explored a different style here. Some of it has a hypnotic feel to it. You might like is as much as I do. The best single was released from the album: \\"Sky fits Heaven\\". I had to give all of the songs ten out of ten.   I also love a book  to practice it with this album Sex and the perfect lover by Mabel Iam to play the sky with your hands
0553801503|1.0|I can't give a review... see... I preordered this book OVER TWO YEARS AGO and still Amazon hasn't shipped it. <br /> <br />Going by the reviews given... Has Martin pulled a Robert Jordan?
B000002MFN|5.0|My Top 5 off of the album are...  <br /> <br /> <br />1) Erotica. This is my favorite song on the album. <br />2) Deeper and Deeper  <br />3) Bad Girl <br />4)Thief of Hearts  <br />5)words
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I can't add much to what other reviewers have said about this, it's just a great show, with almost all the musicians at the top of their form - even if Ringo forgets some words and Eric Clapton looks less than healthy.   <br /> <br />The 'good vibes' just seem to flow from the screen and out of the speakers, especially in the stunning 5.1 mix. The Harrison family has done a great job. <br /> <br />If anyone remembers the VHS version, the sound and picture qulaity are a vast improvement. The second disc has some marvellous extras and interviews and is a joy to watch.  The sense of warmth only fades a bit when you learn about how the record companies bickered about which label would release the music. Also not told here is the role of the British Taxman, but that's another story. <br /> <br />Buy it, enjoy it, support one of George's causes, and keep it handy as you'll want to see this one many times.

6305428298|5.0|There are so many wonderful reviews regarding this spectacular movie that there really isn't anything else to add.... other than... to recommend getting the Absolutely Fabulous dvd boxsets just so you can see Jane shine as \\"Bubble\\" the air-head assistant to Jennifer Saunders' character \\"Adina Monsoon\\".  Jane also had a recurring character named \\"Katie Grin\\" (who was a tv host, sort-of like an annoying Kathy Lee), and these dual roles actually meet up in an episode that is hilarious.  Jane was nominated for 5 awards, including the Golden Globe and BAFTA for her flawless performance in \\"Little Voice\\" and as a result was given her own UK tv series called \\"Never Mind The Horrocks\\".  Hopefully, she will take many more film roles that will showcase her many talents, and possibly record an album of songs for her fans.  As far as I know, the only music recordings of Jane are the 2 songs available on the \\"Little Voice\\" soundtrack-  \\"I Wanna Be Loved By You\\" (imitating Marilyn Monroe), and \\"Get Happy\\" (imitating Judy Garland).  We love ya Jane!
B00097A5HW|4.0|For ever Sharika, she is truly skilled in a blend of north-south-east-west pop and folk. ThIS CD certainly shows her diversity in music and singing abilities. i also recommend a book from a Latina author Mabel Iam, it is amazing her book Sex and the perfect lover and the Kamasutra. I love the chapter about Erotic Dance
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I am not going to ruin the plot of Advent Children, but I will tell you this....Everything you wanted is there.<br /><br />First of all, the CGI is awesome.  The opening sequence drove me nuts.  It made me nostalgic.<br /><br />The fact that all the characters appear was enough for me.  But the big surprise is yet to come.<br /><br />Get this movie.  I got the japanese version and it is awesome.  If u loved playing FFVII, you'll loive this movie.
B0006FO8RA|4.0|Her three \\"previously unreleased\\" songs are alright - \\"My Perogative\\" 's tell-it-like-it-is lyrics are quite empowering IN the album could THE BEST IT IS track #16, \\"I've just begun (having my fun)\\".
B0009353IW|5.0|It's hard to know what to expect reading the descriptions and reviews of this album, so anyone listening to this for the first time has a good chance of hearing something new to them. This album is meant to portray the people and the culture of Chavez Ravine, a Mexican-American community that was torn down in order to build a baseball stadium in the 1950s. The story is told through the music, and the culture of the people of Chavez Ravine is also portrayed through the songs, some newly-composed and some peformed by the pachuco musicians of the area. The booklet included with the CD has English and Spanish translations of all the songs as well as a description of what part of the story each song tells. The musicianship of all the singers and musicians is superb, and while the UFO subplot is strange, it all fits together well. I definitely recommend making time to sit down and listen to this whole CD with the included booklet - the journey is well worth the time.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It has reminded me why the original film was so special. Even though the original will always be a classic, in some ways, I almost think that this movie surpassed the original. For example, it actually showed more than the original film. In the original \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\", it is only mentioned how the Oompa Loompas came to work in the factory. But in \\"Charlie\\", you actually see Wonka go to their home country and find out why they are even working for him. Another interesting thing about this movie is that we get to see into the life of a young Willy Wonka when he was just a child; he has been emotionally scarred by his strict father who never allowed him to eat chocolate or any other candy because his dad was a dentist.<br /><br />The scenery for this film is amazing. From the snow covered city, to the candy room in the factory, it was very beautiful and set the perfect mood for the story. Tim Burton in a recent interview said that it is real chocolate that you see coming down the waterfall, no fake stuff. All in all, it is very wonderful eye candy.<br /><br />As my brother, who was with me mentioned, it was amazing how well the young actors in this film did. Very talented and eerily resembling the actors who were in the original film. The person who was Charlie in the film did an excellent job, and so did the person who played his grandfather. Johnny Depp is the perfect choice for Wonka. Wonka comes off as a big kid and Depp played it brilliantly. He is just what you see on the TV commercials, a very cool character that made the movie even more interesting.<br /><br />The music was very catchy, with each new person that was eliminated from the contest; the Oompa Loompas changed the music entirely for each one. These songs had me tapping my toes at many parts, it has inspired me to go out and buy the soundtrack, and I did. And the classical scores by Danny Elfman were fantastic as well, he is sure to be the next John Williams. His music help set the mood during the opening credits when the chocolate bars are shown being made.<br /><br />Overall, this film is everything I had hoped it would be. This has become my favorite Burton film. The entire time, I can't remember when a smile wasn't literally on my face; it was just like being a kid again watching the original for the first time, even though in some ways the stories are completely different, this movie being closer to the book than the original. This is probably the funniest time I've had in the theater this summer and it was just as enjoyable on the DVD. On a pure enjoyment factor, this movie is tops. What's not to like? It's a feel good movie that touches the inner child in us and leaves you feeling good by the end. If you miss this movie and don't buy it, you are missing something huge.<br /><br />First, when mentioning the special features, I first have to mention the menu screens. Excellently done, each different menu stared Deep Roy as an Oompa Loompa and each screen he is always doing something different. A lot of time was put into just the menu screen; it's nice to know so much care was put into that alone. It was also nice to see Deep Roy do this for us DVD viewers, he is always entertaining.  Now to the special features:<br /><br />Attack of the Squirrels- This is a short making of that shows that these squirrels weren't the easiest actors to work with. It is amazing how much of what we see on the film, not all, was done by real squirrels. We also get a look at the CGI and mechanical squirrels. It's a very interesting look into all of this.<br /><br />The Fantastic Mr. Dahl- This is a touching look at the life of Mr. Roald Dahl, the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory among other novels. This documentary features Dahl's family and friends as their share stories of their lives living with the legend. It also features the family and friends reading excerpts from his various stories. At times, it is very touching to the point tears begin to form. This was a very loving tribute to the author who loved and understood children.<br /><br />Becoming Oompa Loompa- Deep Roy is probably the most talented actor of this film, and this is really shown when you see how much work he put into his performance as an Oompa Loompa. From learning the choreography to having to do the same moves time after time after time, when it's all finished, you find a new appreciation for Deep Roy as an actor.<br /><br />The Five Making of Featurretes- These small mini-documentaries go into detail about how the factory/music and so on was made. My favorite part being how the music was made since this movie has such a brilliant soundtrack.<br /><br />Challenges- These are mini-games that are lots of fun for any age. Oompa-Loompa Dance Machine being my favorite. In this game, you can watch how Deep Roy does the moves for the songs \\"Augustus Gloop\\" and \\"Violet Beauregarde\\" and you can watch and rewatch the steps to learn how to dance like an Oompa Loompa. Then the second part of the game is that when he is dancing, you can use your remote control and follow his dance moves with the remote. If you mess up, the Oompa Loompa will fall and you have to start over. Once you successfully do one dance, more moves are added and the game becomes more difficult. Real fun!<br /><br />Overall this DVD is excellent! A lot of time was put into it and I couldn't be happier.imes, it is very touching to the point tears begin to form.

B000BB1MI2|1.0|It's extraordinary how Tim Burton can make movies that are totally void of humanity and energy and this is his most offensive attempt. It's equally stunning that a remake can eviscerate the brilliant script of the original, take away all humor, quirkiness and cleverness and repackage it with ridiculous changes. And then there's the awful performance of Johnny Depp who has no concept of this character. I believe the original choice for the remake was Nicholas Cage who would've gotten the nastiness of Willy Wonka. I loathed the children and acting all around. I loathed the lame songs. I loathed the money that was spent on this. Take a look at some of the making of extras of the original movie and you'll see it was a labor of love. Like all of Burton's latest movies, this was made for the money. It's eye candy, but it sure ain't sweet.
B0002S943O|5.0|Un concierto increible, una fuerza impresionante. Notables son los temas del \\"Songs of faith and devotion\\" en vivo. En cunto a los clsicos, \\"Behind the wheel\\" en este concierto, es mucho mejor que en \\"101\\". \\"World in my eyes\\", \\"Personal Jesus\\", son espectaculares. \\"Everything counts\\" en una versin actualizada y moderna, totalmente cambiado; una joyita tambin es \\"Fly on the widescreen\\". En cuanto en DVD de Depeche Mode, este es el mejor de todos, aunque \\"One night in Paris\\" tambin es espectacular y el \\"101\\" es bueno, pero quizs se poda haber aprovechado editar el segundo disco con el concierto completo, pero D.A.

B00003BDXG|5.0|The person who wrote the last review is an idiot. First of all, the movie is almost exactly 2 hours long. <br />It is strange though that this movie's theme points out things which other films have commented on. I can't recall any other time that happened. Every movie that comes out is completely original and touches no base on themes from other ones, or so I thought. <br />And I must say that \\"Oliver Stoned\\" is probably the most clever, uniquely brilliant, and HILARIOUS thing I've ever heard. It's right up there with Harry Pothead. <br />It is true that Harrelson and Lewis have completely vanished from the big screen though. Aside from Money Train, Kingpin, The People Vs Larry Flint, Welcome To Sarajevo, Wag The Dog, The Thin Red Line, EdTV, After The Sunset, North Country, The Basketball Diaries, Strange Days, From Dusk Til Dawn, The Other Sister, The Way Of The Gun, Hysterical Blindness, Old School, Cold Creek Manor, Chasing Freedom, a whole mess more, and some that are currently in production, you are correct. I mean, what are they doing now? It looks like they've given up on acting completely and gone into ice fishing or something. <br />The main \\"theme\\" of this review, as I've seen many other reviews have, is to mock a fool you shouldn't listen to. This has been my favorite movie for years, and probably will always be. Stone & Co. greatly improved on Tarantino's original script, the acting is tremendous, and Trent Reznor's choices for the soundtrack match perfectly with every scene. Also, as an editor, the editing work on this movie hasn't been matched by anything I've seen. If you haven't seen NBK, go into it looking for satire and sarcasm more than action. If you have and still don't get it, watch it again. Hell, come over and I'll watch it with you. <br />As for the last poster, I'm just upset that the actual serial killers and mass murderers Mickey and Mallory were based on didn't get to you before being caught.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Her phrasing is still interesting, soulful, many of the arrangements lean towards the gospel r & b style, but she <br />takes the old favorites and breathes new life into them, makes them contemporary and timeless at the same time.  She still <br />fills the words with meaning, yet the songs remain fun to listen <br />to at the same time.  My favorite is her version of Deck the Halls, The First Noel, and Drummer Boy.  Her O Holy Night is <br />awesome as well, she displays power and strength while not being overconcerned with how high she can reach the upper range. <br />This is a very worthwhile collection, highly recommend it!
B0002O06N0|5.0|1. if this doesnt tell you whats wrong with commercial music today. This is a fantastic album, with no airplay....I just dont get it...does everything have to be rechewed bubble gum music to be played on radio......do youself a favor.....clear the palate....try this album.......better then a sinus enema...and easier to swollow.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I must be getting older because I think Muse is a great alternative to the stuff I usually listen to: Carcass, Obituary, Deicide, etc...<br /><br />Loud crunchy guitars, some Queen sounding tunes and vocals, and a few Coldplay like moments.<br /><br />If you are into metal and are looking for something different, check out Muse.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I would hardly consider myself a Green Day fan. I gotta admit that over the years, the band did put out some really catchy songs. Some of my favorite Green Day songs comes from their recent album \\"American Idiot\\". \\"American Idiot\\" has been deemed a punk opera album. The concept of the album being a punk opera album is a bit far fetched for me. I honestly didn't think that it worked. Concept albums are tricky. They either work or don't work. Here I didn't think it worked at all. What really works here is Green Day's knack for a good hook. I found the majority of the album, if not all of the album, to be addictively catchy. One of the songs that compelled me to buy \\"American Idiot\\" is the band's latest single \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", a beautfiul ballad about Billie Joe Armstrong's father who passed away when he was young (not about the war in Iraq contrary to what you might have seen in the music video). I wish the lyrics weren't so repetitive but otherwise it is one of my personal favorite songs off the albums. I also love \\"Holiday\\" which kind of reminds me of \\"Longview\\" thanks to Mike Dirnt's throbbing bass lines. One of my favorite non-single tracks is \\"Are We the Waiting\\" with the hooky chorus which reminds me of some of the music from the hair metal era of the '80s. There are a couple of songs on the album I wasn't too particularly keen on like \\"I Don't Care\\" and \\"Nobody Likes You\\" but otherwise \\"American Idiot\\" is a solid rock album that is chockful of addictive pop hooks.
B00070EBBM|5.0|Emil Gilels became a ponderous interpreter in his later years, as witness the two Brahms concertos he recorded for DG with Eugen Jochum. Here he trims four minutes off the first movement alone, and  Reiner, a far better conductor than Jochum, leads a totally disciplined CSO, making no attempt to beautify Brahms's massive orchestral textures--this is power and polish all the way. As a result, theirs is a great partnership,  as opposed to Richert/Leinsdorf, also with the CSO, where Leinsdorf is clearly the weaker half.<br /><br />I haven't heard the 2005 RCA reissue of Gilels/Reiner (the one here) but earlier versions in various budget lines had fine sound without rising to the exalted level of Living Stereo. (The cheapest issue also includes the dubious bonus of Ormandy's lackluster Haydn Variations.)<br /><br />I don't think another reviewer here is right to say that Gilels is a classicist and Richter a romantic. The obvious difference between the two is that Richter was a lion at the keyboard, dominating the instrument as only Horowitz did in modern times, while Gilels (on records at least) was more self-effacing and middle-of-the-road, too much so later on. Both arrived in the U.S. during the Cold War and reminded listeners with a shock of how overpowering the Russian style of pianism was.<br /><br />All in all, I have relied on Gilels/Reiner being the greatest performance of the Brahms Second on disc, but relistening today, I must admit that Pollini, Ax, Fleisher, and Barenboim have all turned in equally impressive accounts.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.<br /><br />Casino was viewed by most people as nothing but Goodfellas Part 2 upon its initial theatrical release in the summer of 1995. It had the same director (Martin Scorsese), the same writer (Nicholas Pileggi) and the same two stars (Robert DeNiro and Jose Pesci) who happened to be playing mobsters once again (just like they had in Goodfellas).<br /><br />But while Casino's ties to Goodfellas are difficult to ignore, it is really quite a differant movie in some respects and should be viewed on its own terms. But unlike Goodfellas, Casino at times feels slightly bloated, just a bit overlong and is sloppily edited in comparison. But it still manages to remain a very entertaining and insightful look into the behind-the-scenes action in a Las Vegas casino in the late 70's/early 80's. The reason, for the most part, is to a dynamite cast who do some fantastic work.<br /><br />The plot involves Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) a jewish Mobster who dreams of making it big by running a casino in Vegas. He ends up running the Tangiers Casino, and brings along his longtime friend and fellow hoodlum Nicholas \\"Nicky\\" Santoro. While in Vegas Ace meets and falls in love with a beautiful hooker named Ginger (a remarkable performance by Sharon Stone) who is trying to escape from her pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods) and her profession. Ace and Ginger end up getting married and he promises her that he's going to end up going straight. Meanwhile, Nicky becomes the bully of the town and gets involved drugs and basically just making an @$$ of himself. He starts to bring a lot of heat onto Ace since Ace is associates with him, and a huge rift begins to occur between the two. Nicky also feels that Ginger is softening up Ace and ruining his usual way of thinking. Ace eventually breaks off ties with Nicky and Nicky ends up turning to robbing homes and stores to keep up his drug habit and cash flow. Ace begins to have huge problems of his own with Ginger, and the FBI also begins to investigate the financial doings of the Tangiers Casino. Basically, things begin to spiral downwards for everyone in the worst ways.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is a fascinating and insightful view of the inner workings of a casino in that era and what truly went on behind the scenes. It almost has a sort of pseudo-documentary feel to it at times.<br /><br />Once things start to go very wrong, the movie switches gears and becomes increasingly more nasty, dense and difficult to watch at times. The second half is where I feel that the movie ran into most of its problems since it lacks the feel and deft touch that Scorsese brought to the first half.<br /><br />Of all the things that the movie does right, the best is the cast. Robert De Niro might not seem to a likely actor to play play a Jewish mobster (since De Niro's Italian), but he pulls it off convincingly and turns in one of his better performances. Joe Pesci's performance as Nicky at first seems way too similar to his Goodfella's persona, but once his character starts to be at odds with Ace the true side of Nicky manages to come out. James Woods is also his typically great self in a smaller role as Ginger's pimp.<br /><br />The movie, though, belongs to a surprising and brilliant performance by Sharon Stone. Anyone who had written her off as a one-hit wonder from her Basic Instinct heyday were floored by her tremendous dramatic turn in this movie. Sharon runs the gamut of emotions from sweet, sexy, terrified and drugged out at any given moment. Also, to all of her critics she also keeps her clothes on in this film. I know a lot of people thought that her Oscar nominated performance was overrated, but I strongly disagree. Her turn in this movie is the definite highlight and strong point of the film.<br /><br />On the downside, the editing in the movie is surprisingly sloppy and just plain bad at times. I'm usually a fan of the waythat a Scorsese film is typically edited, but I found Casino to be very erratic and choppy at times.<br /><br />The movie is also too long at 3 hours and could have easily had a half hour cut out somewhere, especially during the sometimes bloated and too fleshed out second half. The movie began to feel really repetitive at times once things go sour with the characters. While the performances are sure to keep your attention, I couldn't help but feel that the plot and movie began to spin its wheels at times.<br /><br />The film also contains some of the most brutal and in-your-face violence that I've seen in a R-rated film. One of the most notorious scenes involved a man's head being stuck in a vice and gradually tightened until one of his eyeballs pops out of his head. This is the big scene that caused problems with the MPAA who originally slapped this movie with a NC-17. The scene originally played out with his head eventually getting crushed. In the R-rated cut, they tighten it to a certain point before Nicky has one of his goons cut the guy's throat.<br /><br />There are also some graphic gun shot wounds, a hand being graphically hit repeatedly with a hammer and a baseball bat beating near the end that had me wincing (and I usually don't get bothered by extreme violence). The violence is not so much bloody as it is brutal and painful. People who are easily squeamish need not view this movie.<br /><br />Casino as a whole is an underrated film that is worth checking out. While it has problems, the movie has quite a bit that's really good and features some stunning performances and a great soundtrack. It's apparent that more attention was paid to the first half, but overall I like it. I couldn't get the whole Goodfellas 2 feeling out of my head at first, but eventually I just forgot about it and accepted the movie on its own terms.<br /><br />Casino is nowhere close to being Scorsese's worst film (that would be Bringing Out the Dead IMO) but it also doesn't even come close to the greatness of Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. But it does do enough things right to warrant a worthwhile rental, if not a purchase.<br /><br />Casino is rated R and contains extreme brutal violence and strong language.ually a fan of the way that a Scorsese film is typically edited, but I found Casino to be very erratic and choppy at times.  <br /> <br />The movie is also too long at 3 hours and could have easily had a half hour cut out somewhere, especially during the sometimes bloated and too fleshed out second half.

B000AL730O|2.0|Being a lifelong McCartney fan, who has liked practically everything he has put out,  I was especially surprised with his recent releases \\"Flaming Pie\\", \\"Run Devil Run\\" and \\"Driving Rain\\", all of contained some of his best work in years.  You would think that with his advancing years, that we might hear something like...  well, like this CD&#8230; <br /> <br />After reading the glowing reviews, after having the CD now since the day it came out, and having listened to it now more than 20 times...  I have tried.  Lord, how I have tried.  I have really tried to like this CD.  But I can't.  Yes, the lyrics are definitely much improved over \\"Driving Rain\\".  Yes, it's a much more thoughtful, serious and introspective McCartney.  But it's also a depressing McCartney.  And it's a tired McCartney.  There&#8217;s barely any energy to speak of here, and you almost expect Paul to take a nap after singing each song.  One after another, tired, slow, depressing stuff.  Where is the optimistic McCartney?  Where is the fun-loving McCartney?  Where is there a freakin' electric guitar anywhere on this CD for goodness sake?  Finally near the end we get ONE song with an electric guitar but by then it's far too late.  To be sure I wasn't being unfair, I went back and put in \\"Driving Rain\\" and \\"Flaming Pie\\".  It&#8217;s like night and day.  I don't think I will ever put in this CD again, just forget it ever happened, and watch him perform \\"Helter Skelter\\" from his new \\"Live in Red Square\\" DVD over and over again. <br /> <br />Maybe the critics like \\"Chaos\\" because it is depressing.  But I much prefer the fun, optimistic McCartney (who remembers what an electric guitar is) to this one.  Because of the improved lyrics, two stars, but that's it. <br />
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This show is so well done, it trascends genres--like the Godfather is the great American film because it works on multiple levels, Gilmore Girls is the great American dramedy (as funky as it sounds).  Characters like Kirk are there for just laughs, but so many others in Palladino's \\"little corner of the world\\" are the most human I've seen on T.V.  The situations aren't about rockstars, cops or morons (hopefully no one connects with the latter).  It's about seemingly real lives and it's intellegent (perhaps the reason Lauren Graham is constantly overlooked come award time).  It's what our culture lost. <br /> <br />Season 5 promises to be better then the first four, because there are major character developements with Rory, the long-awaited Luke/Lorelai romance and big things for Lane's band. What I love about this season is that the writers were building up to everything from the beginning, and it finally came out.  Chilton was a stepping stone to Yale and Yale to Emily and Richard;  Rory's turn from her mother(carried into Season 6 too) has been integrated in from the off.  And all you have to do is see the pilot to know how long Luke has been \\"pining\\" for Lorelai.  Even with Lane's role in previous seasons, her character has been climbing the ladder to musical success, hiding CDs in the floor boards. <br /> <br />Spend an hour with the show and you'll see why.
B00005NC66|4.0|What can one say about BREATHLESS that hasn't already been said?  From the opening moments of the film, I was shocked by the camera work.  It was not until after I had seen the film that I learned about its \\"groundbreaking techniques\\" and the fact that many people consider it the beginning of modern cinema.  So I can only tell you my initial impression of the film: this does not feel like 1959.  The close-ups in the opening sequences, the playfulness of Jean-Paul Belmondo's acting style, the spontaneous dialogue and feeling of improvisation-all of these aspects led me to believe that the film was quite modern.  Like a good piece of jazz music from the 1950s which can still shock & awe today, BREATHLESS won me over in its opening sequences.  It is definitely \\"in your face\\" filmmaking at its best.<br /><br />One thing that BREATHLESS certainly nails is the relationship between our \\"Bonny & Clyde\\" characters.  Many people have complained about the \\"bedroom\\" sequence, citing its length, lack of scripted dialogue, and the like.  It would never have survived in modern cinema.  However, Godard manages to capture something in these \\"spontaneous\\" sequences.  I really felt like they were a casual couple.  Their lines are not perfect.  They are reacting to one another.  It's like we've been placed in their bedroom and we feel as if we are a hundred miles from any theater.  This is life.  Is it true that life is a bit boring at times and lacks a script?  Yeah.  But perhaps that is his point.  BREATHLESS, despite its titles, \\"breathes\\" life into its script and characters by allowing them to improvise their way through the film.<br /><br />That being said, I think that all \\"groundbreaking\\" films are destined to get certain things wrong.  In particular, BREATHLESS \\"feels\\" a bit too experimental.  That is to say, it is an experiment in going against the grain and it is (sometimes) painfully aware of that fact.  Let's take the \\"jump cuts,\\" for instance.  While Godard may have paved the way for modern \\"quick cuts,\\" his jump cuts often occur within a scene and give the film an \\"amateur\\" feel at times.  Remember when you made the videos for Spanish class and had to go back and \\"fix\\" a line error?  Do you remember the awkward cuts and how that would effect both the visual and auditory aspects of your movie?  Well, that's kind of what happens in BREATHLESS.  In fact, it happens so often that one wonders if he wasn't trying to go for that effect. It is distracting at several points in the film and I am one who would've recommended a bit more polish in places.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend you see this film if you are interested in film history and seeing the so-called \\"great films.\\"  BREATHLESS is the start of something huge and is often regarded as a pinnacle work of one of the world's greatest directors of all time.  But if you're looking for a date movie or something for the whole family, I'd probably choose something else.  There's a bit too much of \\"life\\" in this movie to make it suitable for mindless popcorn munching.paved the way for modern \\"quick cuts,\\" his jump cuts often occur within a scene and give the film an \\"amateur\\" feel at times.

B00003CXC6|5.0|First of all, let me just say this: if you are not a fan of Japanese films, Kurosawa, or \\"Samurai\\" flicks in general, you owe it to yourself to see RASHOMON and change your opinion.  It is a gorgeous film visually, emotionally powerful, and is short enough to keep even the most impatient filmgoer content.  The plot is deceptively simple: a heinous crime has been committed in the dream-like landscape of the forest.  A samurai has been found dead in the woods and his wife raped.  What unfolds is four different \\"versions\\" of what happened, told by each of the persons involved in the incident.<br /><br />Many viewers have complained about the lack of objective truth in the film.  They do not want four \\"versions\\" of the story.  They want the truth.  Some viewers expect this film to be a murder/mystery, a \\"whodunit\\" film.  \\"So who actually killed the samurai?\\" they ask.  But the film is not about discovering who, nor is it concerned with figuring out the objective truth.  If anything, Kurosawa's film cares about humanity's inability to experience life unfiltered from our subjective viewpoints.  The result: a statement that there is, perhaps, no such thing as objective truth.  RASHOMON seems to be interested in the way that each of us experiences and observes the world differently by enlarging and distorting the role that we play in various events.  Each of the initial three storytellers claims to be responsible for the crime, suggesting how we each \\"personalize\\" reality to provide ourselves with meaning and understanding.  The effect is marvelous.<br /><br />Realism looms large in the film.  From their own viewpoint, our samurai warriors are the paragons of bravery and military excellence.  Yet, from a different viewpoint, they are both examples of cowardice, yielding one of the most truthful and honest swordfighting sequences I have ever seen.  I'm talking about a sequence in which people get exhausted (fighting is tough) and are afraid to die.  Few films manage to capture life with such a purity.<br /><br />The visual cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning.  The film begins with a dreary rain sequence in which the audience is invited under a shelter with some of its principle characters.  The rest of the film flashes back and forth in time between the crime and the dreary rain.  The contrast of the downpour with the \\"dreamlike\\" forest is effective and disturbing.  The forest sequence, which soon follows the opening, finds our principle storyteller walking into the woods, as if to symbolize a journey to another reality.  The camera work in the woods is phenomenal and we get to witness several new techniques being tried out: shooting directly at the sun through the leaves of trees, casting dark (false) shadows from fake trees on the characters' faces, and one long-rail shot that, for its time period, is light years ahead of its time.  The trial sequence is also unique and interesting.  Rather than show us who is doing the questioning, instead we just get to hear the witnesses' side of the investigation.  Moreover, the witnesses speak directly into the camera, giving the film the feel that they are confessing their story to us, the audience.<br /><br />RASHOMON is a brilliant film and I believe it holds up to Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, often regarded as his masterpiece.

You will be transported to another world only to find yourself facing difficulties in your own life.to capture life with such a purity. <br /> <br />The visual cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning.

B000BB1MHS|5.0|This isn't really a remake. Willa Wonka and The Chocoalte Factory....that's the one with Gene Wilder..and it was loosely based on the book entitled: \\"Charlie and the Chocoalte Factory.\\" Yes that's right..it was a book first. The movie \\"Charile and The Chocoalte Factory\\" is actually a movie version of the book...with a few things added or altred. In the book there were actually flashbacks to Wonka's childhood just like there are in the movie. Though the book never really talked about his father. There was only one line in the book about his father. Having said this....this movie is excelnt I loved it for two main reasons ...one: Tim Burton directed it...I love Tim Burton. And two...Johnny Depp was in it..Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. I also loved well...everything else about it. If you haven't seen this movie yet I suggest you watch it. You don't have to buy it...but just at least watch it..and then make up your mind about what you think of it. For me it was just a delightful adventure through a chocoalte factory. And another chance to experaince Tim Burton's vision of something I had loved before. Johnny Depp's acting was amazing in this movie..he had me laughing all the way through. Some things might have been fore seeabile...but I laughed at them all the same. I turlly think you'll enjoy this movie...espically if you enjoyed \\"Willa Wonka and the Chocoalte Factory.\\"
B00005ATQH|4.0|I came to LOLITA without any idea of its subject matter.  I was soon shocked by the \\"love story\\" it tells and I was subsequently drawn into the film completely.  It is a mark of all of Kubrick's films that, while they may shock and disturb the audience, it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen.  LOLITA is no exception.  I should have known.  The screenplay was written by Vladimir Nabokov, whose novel PALE FIRE also captivated my imagination some years ago, and he certainly knows how to explore the depths of human emotion.  This story is rather \\"on the edge\\": a middle-aged professor becomes obsessed with his daughter's landlord.  What's the problem?  Well...the daughter isn't even in high school yet.<br /><br />Kubrick handles the subject matter with great subtlety.  By today's standards, there is nothing really objectionable in this film (at least visually).  None of the \\"intimate\\" scenes are graphic and everything is expressed through innuendo and suggestion.  Yet, the film still manages to upset audiences.  Kubrick's portrayal is enough to make audiences squirm in their seats, even though Lolita (Sue Lyons) is far too old for the part and is somewhat convincing as a tease and suitable object of sexual desire.  I found out that in the novel Lolita is even younger than seen here.  What makes LOLITA powerful is the fact that the young girl is not entirely the victim.  She is a girl fully aware of her power over men and uses this power to great effect.  We squirm because we are not accustomed to seeing a young teenager playing the role of Cleopatra.<br /><br />However, I was not thrilled with the entire film.  I think that all of the scenes with Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) are simply confusing, probably given the fact that this is a film and not the novel.  Quilty's motivations are never clearly revealed and he seems rather willing to chase Lolita and Professor Humbert around for the sole purpose of ending Humbert's dreams and ending the movie.  I have to imagine that we are granted a much fuller account of his psychology in the novel.  Additionally, the opening sequence (in which Sellers talent is quite apparent) seems awkward and contrived by the end.<br /><br />James Mason's performance is incredible in this film.  He truly becomes his part, conveying his twisted desire without exception.  We do not get caught up in his reasoning, nor are we asked to feel sympathy for him.  His part fails to gain sympathy.  Instead, we are asked to sort out the ethical mess he has made.  In the end, LOLITA is a fascinating film and I highly recommend it.  Though, you may want to put smaller children out of the room before you press \\"play.\\"ave to imagine that we are granted a much fuller account of his psychology in the novel.

B00005JL78|4.0|After the first viewing of Minority Report I loved it. After a second viewing I liked it. The problem is the plot holes become increasingly distracting the more times the movie is watched. One of the fundamental rules of fantasy and science fiction is when you establish the rules of the world you're creating you owe it to your audience to stick to those rules.<br /><br />In the case of `Minority Report' the established rules are as follows. The police of the future, through a series of circumstances, find themselves the possessors of three `precogs' (psychics with precognition). However, the movie is very explicit that the only future events they can see are murders (because murders are the most emotional of crimes). The three psychics are able to transmit hazy images of the future crime and it's up to John Anderton (Tom Cruise) to decipher the psychic messages. All three psychics are required and although the three psychics are always correct they don't always agree. If two out of three agree the majority wins and the minority opinion is stored away in a classified `minority report'. If the public were made aware that the precogs occasionally disagreed bye bye pre-crime division. Everything is running along smoothly until Cruise finds himself observing a future murder where he is the killer of a man he's never even met.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />The main problem with the movie is that the conspiracy against Cruise could never possibly work. Cruise uses the precognicient vision in order to track down the man he was supposedly going to kill. How could the precogs have possibly fortold a future that couldn't possibly occur without the existence of the precognition? It sets up an impossible loop. The second big problem occurs after Cruise kidnaps the most talented of the three precogs in order to extract the Minority Report from her brain. The movie was very explicit that the precogs only predicted murders AND require all three yet suddenly she's not only able to predict non murder futures she seems to be able to predict all possible futures. And why would the plot suddenly give her a power that seems to dwarf the ability to see future murders? The answer is plot convenience. In one part she even is given the ability to see visions of futures that couldn't possible occur and just as suddenly as her omniscience arrives it vanishes as needed to push forward the plot. The third problem is that the final precognition is clearly wrong despite the movies insistence that the precogs are never wrong. A `murder' did NOT occur unless suicide is considered murder and the precogs vision was completely different from the events shown. It's a bewildering finale to a movie filled with plot holes.<br /><br />The lazy scripting takes away a lot but with Steven Spielberg directing the pacing and presentation is top notch. Mr. Spielberg uses an interesting visual style that gives the entire movie a dreamlike quality and the money spent is pretty apparent on the screen. If you are the type of viewer who can shut his/her brain off it's a five star film but if you spend a lot of time contemplating the nuances of a film it's a three star affair. I'll compromise and give it four.predict non murder futures she seems to be able to predict all possible futures.
