B000FVQM2Y|4.0|\\"Brick\\" is a slick, stylized thriller about a young man trying to piece together the puzzle that's left after his love is killed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the lead and he does a fantastic job playing the \\"Sam Spade\\" of the  movie. The film has a lot of references to crime films of the 40s, including dialogue and characters. The supporting cast does a great job, particularly Lukas Haas as \\"Pin\\" and the femme fatale of the movie. If you like crime films, pulp movies, and detective stories, this is a movie more than worth the effort.
159420229X|5.0|The book was quite interesting in that it caused me to revive an old interest in memory skills. It clearly indicated that most of us ordinary persons can use the brain to store much useful information, as well as trash, if one is so inclined. G.Hardy Rudd, MD, FACS
0786956291|5.0|To start off, let's list the already listed items inside:  -A \\"Choose-your-own-adventure\\" style book to help create a character  -A \\"DM\\" book that lays out the basic rules and gives you a good adventure  -Dice  -Token sheet, with monsters being doubled sided (the other side containing a DIFFERENT monster)  -A fold-out map of the entire adventure setting  -A paper die-cut sheet of power cards and items  To start, this is meant as an INTRODUCTORY to the rules. Characters created using this box don't follow the rules of D&D Essentials (I don't have the \\"normal\\" 4e books, so it may follow those rules.) A lot of character powers and rules are changed. Still, this is in no way a bad product. It does exactly what it says it does: introduces 4e to new players or returning players.  The monster tokens are unlike the other tokens in the Essentials line in that they have a different monster on the other side, instead of the same monster but with a red ring around it; so that's nice.  The fold out map is nice, and can be used for a lot more than just the adventure used in this box.  The DM's book has the whole adventure in it, which leads you through the adventure in a straightforward and logical way (which bring players from level 1 to 2.)It has a small collection of various monsters and enemies in the back, and also gives some information on how to craft adventures.   Now, this whole deal may be good for returning players who are trying out 4e, but it is definitely recommended for first-time players and DMs. If you want to eventually get into the game more you'll have to actually buy Essentials line or \\"normal\\" 4e books though.

B000005E3K|3.0|In the hands of a Master, Mozart's Requiem is kin to Macduff's bellow: \\"Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, And look on death itself.\\"<br /><br />A fellow reviewer's disparaging comments on Christie in Charpentier caused me to dust off my copy of his K 626. For years it has been sitting there, untouched and unloved. It's time to ratify the original thumbs-down.<br /><br />There is one out-take from Christie's Requiem Aeternam, Kyrie and Dies Irae:  the conductor is emotionally inhibited. He is a blood-brother to Jeggy - so to speak.<br /><br />The Tuba Mirum is wretched. Its trombone opens unsubtly and the singers (particularly the bass) follow its lead. Anachronistically and unconvincingly, Christie slams on the brakes towards the end of the Rex Tremendae. The Confutatis is the greatest movement in the Requiem: it mirrors the Last Judgement. Here, it's inert: there is no smell of brimstone where the \\"just man is barely safe\\". This failure relegates Christie to the billy-goat category.  The Lacrymosa is dutiful rather than elegiac. With his ticket-to-conduct clipped by the Period Practice Taliban, Christie skips through the Hostias as if gathering nuts in May. Disappointingly, one never senses an inner dialogue in the Benedictus: they soloists sing the text aptly and no more. Speaking of which, the soprano Anna Maria Panzarella has a twittery weightless voice that is so beloved by practitioners of period practice but it does bugger all for me. Stutzmann is easier on the ear and makes more of the text itself. I was not overwhelmed by Pregardien, not that the tenor has much to do in this work.<br /><br />The Ave Verum Corpus is not a patch on the famous [[ASIN:B0000040XF Mozart: Exsultate, Jubilate, K. 165; Vesperae solennes de confessore, K. 339; Kyrie in D minor, K. 341; Ave verum corpus, K. 618]]. And De Burgos (among many others) is far preferable in the main work [[ASIN:B000026GD1 Mozart: Requiem]]<br /><br />All in all, this Christie performance is not an 'into-the-crypt' rendition of K 626. As period practice goes, Christie is not an outrider like Harnoncourt or Savall: it's listenable and reverentially performed. Intonation is good. But make no mistake: this is a faux requiem. And Macduff, where are you?not an 'into-the-crypt' rendition of K 626. As period practice goes, Christie is not an outrider like Harnoncourt or Savall: it's listenable and reverentially performed. Intonation is good. But make no mistake: this is a faux requiem. And Macduff, where are you?
B005DZMODI|3.0|Musicianship was outstanding, but to me most of the tracks sounded more like Dixieland than what I think of as \\"blues\\".  I have other Clapton albums that are a more \\"blues-like\\"...for example \\"Me & Mr Johnson\\".
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I actually read the 2nd book, Hide, in the series first. I thought Alone was interesting for a few reasons. DD Warren was such minor character in this book you wouldnt have guessed this would be a series featuring her character. We got to know Officefr Dodge in great depth, including his traumatic past. Everyone around Catherine Cagnon, a woman with a traumatic past, is being killed and Bobby Dodge is moving up the suspect list. Once Bobby sees her as a victim and not a temptress can he clear his name and keep Catherine and her son. Nathan, safe. I look forward to reading the rest of the series. This character should be of interest to those looking for a good thriller or police procedural series.
B004HW7JMO|1.0|I received Spartacus: Gods of the Arena through Amazon Vine for review. As an action film fan, I was curious. I'm so glad I didn't pay for it, as I couldn't finish watching. There aren't many films that I'll stop watching purely because of content, but after almost five solid minutes of stylized violence and gore straight from a horror movie, I had more than enough. Yes, the gladiator sport was a bloody one, but it's not something I want to see glorified. It was violence just for the shock value. Still, I tried fast-forwarding through the bloody scenes to get to the talking/plot. But there doesn't seem to be much. I haven't seen any of the rest of this series, since I don't have the Starz channel. And I was immediately lost. Unfortunately, this show just wasn't for me.
B001LMAK88|5.0|This 1985 Film captures Action, Drama, Light Humor, Great Outdoor filming (shot in Sante Fe New Mexico), with an all star cast.  You will find yourself desiring to watch this film multiple times - it moves along briskly, and can be watched by the whole family without worry of - typical now adays - four letter wording, sex or drug related scenes.  Yet this \\"is\\" an action packaged film.  The four unlikely main characters...meet by chance - and are on the road to Silverado.  Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner, Kevin Kline, Danny Glover, Brian Dennehy, and Linda Hunt turn in great performances.
B0052GACNM|5.0|It became apparent after listening to Tony Bennet's recording with Amy Winehouse that the music industry had lost a giant when Amy died.  This is a beautiful way to hear her last recording, singing that great old tune, \\"Body and Soul\\" with the great Tony Bennett.  Everyone on this recording has done an excellent job, too, but it was Amy's song that made me buy this one.  I'll cherish that voice, body and soul, for the rest of my days.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This dvd is great. It is like being at one of their concerts. My son recorded the concert on vhs tape and I watched it many times. However I lost the tape when I moved.

1405255439|3.0|With the upcoming film and all the great reviews here, I decided to get a copy for myself.  I'm not a stranger to reading children's books, though I must admit that I generally prefer books for a somewhat older age group.  War Horse looks to be for kids about ten, though it could be enjoyed by older children as well.  It's a short book, it took me somewhat over an hour to read, though I'm a quick reader.  But my problem with the book isn't it's length, but it's somewhat even use of emotions.  The story never thrilled me, it never brought tears to my eyes, it never caused any strong emotion in me.  I should have been in tears as our hero loses a friend, or when we found out that he's deathly ill.  I should have been excited and happy at the ending.  I should have felt some strong emotion somewhere.  But I didn't.   It also suffers in lack of detail and the glossing over of events.  Being as short as it is, it can't be expected to go into detail, but that's part of what can make a great book great.    Don't get me wrong.  It's not a bad book at all.  But I don't believe it holds up well for adults.  I'm glad I read the book, and if you like having read the book prior to seeing a film, I encourage it.  Just don't go in with high expectations.  Again, yes, I understand this is a children's book, and as a children's book it may be a great book.  But with the number of reviews out there implying that it's a great book for adults as well I thought another voice was worthwhile.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|I watched all 4 seasons in 3 days. What does that tell you? I was addicted to it. I've seen most of all the best tv series programs that have ever aired on cable, but this one blows them all away - period. Don't want to take my word for it, it's your loss. Netflix streams the first three seasons, and I paid Amazon to watch every episode of the fourth season. WOW! WOW! WOW!
1594744769|5.0|As an author, I read a great deal within my chosen genre, to keep myself abreast of what the market is like. Usually, this research does not inspire particularly active interest, and indeed I usually feel like I could do better myself, or that the author has done little more than perpetuate YA sterotypes and indulge in lazy plot construction. (I hate it when I can see the seams in a novel.) In the instance of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, however, I was struck by the originality and particular voice of the author.<br /><br />Riggs' characters are clever and well depicted, and the story line has no holes and few shoddy seams. I'm not usually a fan of novels that end as cliff-hangers or obvious \\"Act 1\\"s of a larger series, but I can forgive Riggs for this. At least he rounded out enough of this story to make the ending at least endurable if not satisfying.<br /><br />But of course, the real draw for this book are its peculiar photographs. Applying the oddities of human action in a novel of this sort, to attach lives and a story to the souless, forgotten, two dimentional images of these antique photos, is a stroke of genius. Occationally, the insertion of the photos into the story line seemed a little obvious, if not entirely forced -- I'd hope for a little more finesse in the sequel which is obviously on its way -- but that hardly matters when you take into account the impact these photos have on the reader.<br /><br />This novel has just the right level of creepy, and the photographs bring that home in a way no mere description can convey. To the extent that I found myself waking up from a nightmare this morning, with perfect images of the characters and villains running around in my subconcious. I was not disturbed because the book was unduly gory, or the characters or situation overly disturbing (though the most disturbing character was supposed to be a good guy. Explain to me exactly how any normal non-psychopathic person REALIZES he can rip the hearts out of animals and animate corpses or dolls with them?) But the inclusion of the photographs into the story -- photographs and drawings that would have been disturbing by themselves -- drills the story and characters into your mind. I found myself reminded of some of Edward Gorey's excellent line drawings.<br /><br />The photographs I found the most disturbing, oddly, were not the creepy wild-eyed children or the strange monsterous creatures, but the heart-rending depictions of normal human moments. In particular the photograph entitled \\"This is why,\\" could, even by itself, make your heart bleed. Well done Ransom. May your sequels be as clever.te corpses or dolls with them?)

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|I had considered buying this movie, but I decided to rent it first, which is a good thing.  While the movie was filmed beautifully, there was little to no emotion conveyed by the characters.  I got bored and fell asleep while watching it, and I love Jane Eyre.  I felt as though there were many areas of the story that were not expounded upon in the way that they deserved to be, and there was no chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester!  I suggest the Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Eyre, if you're looking for a better retelling of the story.  Yes, it's longer, but it's worth it. [[ASIN:B000LPQ6DE Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre]]
0812550706|1.0|If you are under 15 years of age, you might enjoy this story. But for anyone over 15, move on ... this is just juvenile. The nature of the interactions, the dialog, the story. It was so bad I didn't get past page 100 and I can't bring myself to attempt another Card book.
0756404738|5.0|This happened with the first book, the Name of the Wind, as well.  Halfway through this book I was disappointed that it was already halfway over. Now that I've finished, I have to wait till who knows when to hear the end of the story. Incredible story. There are people being nitpicky about minor \\"inconsistencies\\" that the vast majority of people won't notice and giving it only 3 stars, ignore those guys, it's well worth your time.
0385534639|5.0|I loved this book! When I purchased it I purchased two copies by mistake. I was going to send one back when my daughter pulled it out and starting reading it too.

This would be one book that I hope to see on the BIG Screen. Wonderful Reading!!!

B005BJ7Y54|2.0|The album received a 9.3 and best new album label from pitchfork. I was excited to check it out. Sonically its kind of cool, lots of retro sounds which I'm fine with.  Honey Bunny starts that album off which right away I noticed I didn't love but was tolerable, could see putting it on while cleaning the house or doing some other mundane task.  By the time I got to the third track I lost interest. Die starts off with a 1:30 of \\"jamming\\"  which is not in the least bit interesting. We then get a short verse and the jamming/ guitar solo continues. I bet it even rocks live but, it makes me want to skip to the next song. Unfortunately once I have the urge to skip songs half way through, I usually can't stop myself. And Girls give me no reason not to. Its a vibe record and maybe it will grow on me but, after 2 listens I can't get in to it. Long intros, long drawn out jams, and short of substance.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I bought this for my wife for her birthday.  It is 8 disks of the TV show and movies.  She would watch it when I was around and watch it when I wasn't.  It took her only two or three weeks to watch every disk.  I wasn't much of a fan of the show when I was younger, but the episodes I did see were actually really really funny and I kept finding myself sitting down to watch episodes with her when I had meant to be doing something else.  So yeah, good show.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|I spent my teenage yrs. in the middle&late 1950's.  quiet innocent and rock and roll time. Carefree and fun.  But, then came the 1960's.:  for the first time i saw a beautiful first lady who had dark hair was not white: A young and handsome president with cute small children.  So refreshing to the 20 somethings.  Then came the horrific assasssination of president  kennedy, it was so frightening. I thought,  what will happen to our country now.?  The only thing the american people  knew about the assasination is  what the news reported; most info  never made any sense, the majority of americans knew we were not being told the whole truth, but then the Vietnam war is taking lots of southern/north white and black boys, people protesting vietnam war(that majority of americans did not even understand why we were in vietnam), students being shot at kent state, blacks marching for equality, martin luther assassinated, then bobby kennedy assassinated.  To go from the peaceful 50's to all this death and devastation was mind boggling. (Nothing to say of all the body bags being brought home from Vietnam)  Most americans in 1960's did not trust us gov.  we knew we were told what they wanted us to hear.  Pres. Nixon promised to bring our boys home from Vietnam, I voted for him, it took 3yrs before he brought them home. You cannot trust anyone. Today my grandchildrens generation  are fighting Iraq and Afghanistan war, if anyone dare spit on them, would not be a good idea.  Husbands(vietnam) are one thing, my grandchildern are a entirley different ballgame, i am like a ferocious lion when it comes to my grands.  I am now 69yrs. and the JFK movie tells just how corrupt the American Gov. can be and get away with it.  IT SHOULD MAKE ANY AMERICAN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT INFORMATION US GOV. AND NEWS MEDIA FEEDS US....THANK GOD FOR COMPUTERS and OUR CYBER WORLD.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books (The Hunger Games, Catching Fire) fit quite comfortably in with the best books of the Dystopian future genre rife with a fear driven empire, uncaring citizens, an evil Emperor, and a girl with a bow, who could ask for more.  All that being said, Mockingjay drops the ball on this otherwise top notch series.  The worst thing in this book is all the whining, Katness spends over half the book in a dark haze, consisting of pouting and aimless wandering and more pouting.  When we finally get the Katness we all know and love back, we get to keep her for about a quarter of the book before losing her again to pouting etc...  This book could easily be condensed into an extra ten chapters on the end of Catching Fire, that wouldn't leave all the fans groaning as we watch an otherwise relatable character into Bella (just sayin').  Most of the other problems crop up as the story progresses, the love triangle (Gail, Katness, Peeta), awkward at its best turns almost unbearable.  Very little of the rebellion is shown, most is consumed by the aforementioned pouting.  And the final twist (Possible Spoiler alert) completely negates the first books gain.  This book isn't horrible by any means, yet when compared to its two prequels it just doesn't meet the standard previously set by the author.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|This review is going to be rather short since most of the pro's and con's have been listed numerous times by quite a few people. However, I just wanted to throw my two cents in and say that I love the sound quality of this product, and the mic works great for me. However, the reason I'm giving this a 3 is that the headset will turn off on me randomly as I'm gaming. Even with a constant flow of sound coming through and brand new batteries the result is still the same. It could stay on for a couple hours, or for just a few minutes, but in the end it still shuts off. I don't know if this is just a defect in the product I received, but it's rather annoying.
0062060554|4.0|This book just kept me turning to the next page. I wanted to know how she would get her life back after a horrific event gave her amnesia. Whom to trust and the writing in a journal were the compelling components in this book. I would recommend this book to those who like a slowly unveiling story of suspense.
0062060554|5.0|In fairness, I don't read a lot of fiction. That's because I am usually bored to death and/or irritated by the time I get to the end of the first chapter. (I read a lot of first chapters.) This book made me remember the experience of hating to put a book down and thinking about it during the work day, eager to get back to it. It resonated with a lot of what is going on in my own life these days, and I think that will be true for anyone who is having a tough time of it. I came out of it remembering -- and NOT in a sappy way -- what really matters. And I was thoroughly entertained every single moment I was reading it. I'm looking forward to reading more from this new author.
B004SHED22|5.0|I found this book both heartbreaking and riveting. I kept hoping against hope that things wouldn't turn out the way I knew they must. One cares so much about Sarah that when the narration shifts to Julia only I felt a real loss. It is, of course, about an event that so many people don't know about but should know. But it's more than that. It's about guilt, about guilt of the survivor, about the need that Julia felt to make sure that Sarah and her brother were not forgotten. This need is reflected in the need people have to treasure old photographs, trace their roots or write their memoirs. The book haunts you long after you've put it down.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|While Doctor Who has been on British television for a long time (the 50th anniversary is November 2013), forget all that.  You can sit down with this box set, starting with the 11th Doctor, and you won't have missed a thing! Everything is explained. It's the perfect entry into this awesome show.  This is a wonderful series about the most amazing man, the Doctor, from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor in the flying blue box, that takes you on voyages of time and space. It's the most amazing show, and the best thing is you can watch it all with your entire family.  The head writer (and show runner) Steven Moffat, does a marvelous job telling you about the Doctor, and you don't have to know a thing.  The stories are quite lovely, written in this series with a Fairy-Tale motif that will blow you away.  Matt Smith, the actor who plays the Doctor, is the most wonderful Doctor yet; you can almost believe he IS the Doctor.  Wonderful acting and storytelling.  Some of the stories will make you cry.  Don't miss this!  Brilliant television.  Beware, however. It may turn you into a Whovian, and you'll want to go and explore the last couple of Doctors before him...

B0053F042G|5.0|Most of the recent sci-fi movies coming out of Hollywood are short on story and long on special effects.  That's not the case here.  This is a story built layer upon layer, playing out in bits and getting stronger as it goes along.<br /><br />I didn't expect this at all.  I expected the opposite.<br /><br />This story is told so well, that the viewer becomes emotionally invested in it.  In it's outcome, and the possibilities it presents.<br /><br />A very suspenseful, thoughtful, and witty piece of storytelling craftsmanship.<br /><br />I like being brought into a film, and this does just that.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|After watching Paul I decided I wanted my own copy with all the extra's.  This fit the bill and the wallet.  Came quickly and we rewatched it and loved it even more!! This movie was hysterical!
B0055G9L9U|5.0|I will admit, that I was a bit hesitant to see Paul for awhile. Mostly because I loved Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz so much. Secondly, the previews really didn't do it justice. But, rest assured, it's fantastic.  I wasn't sure if Pegg and Frost would pull off their third film together without Edgar Wright directing and co-writing. What if it was Wright that was the funny one? True, Paul isn't quite in the league with their first two, but it's pretty damn close. Plus, it's pretty atheisty (heard a Christian shout \\"It's not funny!\\" at the screen at one point), and skeptical, as well as being fun sci fi.  I'm not particularly a fan of Seth Rogen, who voiced the alien Paul, so if I were to pick on anything about the film, it would be his performance. But, quite frankly, the rest of the film is so good, his shtick works just fine, i.e., he doesn't Robin Williams it to death.
0930289234|5.0|Excellent purchase.  Entire series in one compliation with lots of backstory notes in between each \\"chapter\\".  Quality is excellent and a real value for the price.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The movie is awesome, but I am blown away, and more than a little bit disheartened, by how angry people get watching something like this. Is it because it is just so far over their head that their lack of understanding makes them feel stupid and they react by lashing out and making a scene? Is it just this Fox News mentality of abusing something that thinks differently than you? Whatever it is, I dislike it immensely. I was dragged to see Transformers 2 a year ago and it was the worst movie experience of my life. I endured the whole thing and didn't have the urge to run out half way through calling everyone dumb on the way out. We've become deeply intolerant it seems.
B005FLX2WC|2.0|6 of 6 people found the following review OFFENSIVE because it isn't a 5-star review: (that's probably how the line above my review title should read)  I thought for sure buying this was a no-brainer, but I am disappointed overall. Considering Beth Hart's amazing vocal ability and Joe B.'s guitar prowess, this album had the potential to be the best album of the year...well for me, it fell way short. I thought Beth was supposed to be a Janis disciple--well, where's the blues rock of Janis Joplin? I didn't find much of it on here. I did find a lot of ballads with Kevin Shirley's trademark insomnia-killing, lush orchestration backgrounds. On the last track, Hart sounds like she's imitating Sarah McLaughlin more than Janis--zzzzzzzzz. And Joe's guitar playing is too restrained, I think. He only kinda lets loose on one song, and the other tracks just don't sound like Joe. Sure, shredding would have been overkill on most of these tracks, so that's why I wish they would have picked some tracks that lent more to Joe's enormous guitar talent. And the sound of his guitar is murky and distant, like he's playing in a big empty room three doors down the hall--not good at all.  The Billie Holiday song is boring too, sounding too much like actual Billie Holiday recordings. Why not update the sound somewhat--just too dated. If you're going to cover a song for a CD, it seems to make sense to do something different with it and make it better, at least in some ways, rather than stick to the original sound. What I DID like was Beth's impersonation of Etta James--great stuff! She really nailed Etta's vocal style, and I thought the legend herself was guest-singing when I first heard her. \\"Something's Really Got A Hold On Me\\" is a great song, but the band screwed around with the chord changes at the end of the chorus and kind of ruined it. I'm all for changing the music if it makes it sound better, but I think in this case it definitely did not. And again, they could have if they wanted to.  Since this was a covers-only album, the field was wide open, and they could have picked some better material to record. The first track was promising enough, but it pretty much goes downhill after that, with exception to one or two slow blues numbers and the Etta James stuff. \\"Chocolate Jesus\\"...sheesh! TERRIBLE! What's that doing on there?? I was wondering if \\"Oom Papa Oom Papa\\" from Oliver! was coming up next...   Some of the production was empty and sparse in places without sounding \\"raw\\". A little more rocked up sound with more guitars and less freakin' orchestration would have made it better, IMO.  So, sorry to spoil all the 5-star celebration, but I have to say I was disappointed. It could have been a lot better than it is.  EDIT: This idea of \\"helpful\\" votes, while originally a good idea, has degenerated into a total joke. I explained what I didn't like about the album...how is that not helpful? The reveiwer above mine bashed me simply for leaving a critical review. His own review offered no specific insight into the CD, and someone actually marked his review as being helpful. ??? That proves that people are not utilizing these review forums correctly. But that's fine...do as you like...go ahead and vote \\"unhelpful\\"! I don't care, as long as my review gets read. Now If you have read my review and truly, sincerely find it unhelpful, rather than being personally offended that it doesn't reflect your own opinion of this CD, then my apologies. And by the way, if your honest opinion of this CD is far different from mine, by all means, post your review accordingly! I won't get offended, and I welcome any civil discussions pertaining to my review! :-)
0553582461|5.0|It is hard to imagine topping the \\"Assassin trilogy\\" but the conclusion of FitzChivilry's and the Fool's story was even better.  These are complex, multi-dimensional and real characters that lend themselves to this heart wrenching story. After all the pain and suffering that Fitz goes through, you have to root for a \\"lived happily ever after\\" ending.   But nothing is easy for Fitz, who is truly the \\"Sacrifice\\" of his people. It's always hard to end a series that has this kind of scope and magnificance, but I was not disappointed. I only hope that the rest of Robin Hobb's books are as good as these 6. I would rank this series in my Top 10 all-time (I have read over 1,000 books in this genre). I couldn't put this trilogy down until the last page turned. This story and these characters stay with you long after the you finish. Well worth the time. Kudos!!
B004XWMXW4|5.0|2Cellos is wonderfully entertaining. The musicians are superb. I recommend this CD to everyone who enjoys music.   I was introduced to 2Cellos as the introduction to Elton John in concert. The only thing better than this CD is to see them in person.
B0052GACNM|3.0|This CD seems to me just another way to milk the public and take advantage of Tony Bennett's fame, with most of the singers in  this DUETS II cashing in on Bennett's popularity.<br />Most of these singers do not add anything worthwhile to Bennett's songs. Tony Bennett's CD, with all these classical tunes, would have sounded better without anybody else singing, except maybe when he sings with Andrea Boccelli.<br />Well, I wasted $11.99 in this CD, and I should have listened to the excerpts found here before buying it.<br />I am sure this CD will do very well and, after all everyone has bills to pay, even Tony Bennett.
0425205061|5.0|I enjoy reading the Jack Reacher books and when I recently went on vacation in Las Vegas two weeks ago, I lost \\"the Killing Floor\\".  I travelled to different book stores but couldn't find it so I finally ordered it from Amazon.com so that when I got back home, I could continue to read it.  When I got home, the book was waiting for me in my mail box.  Thank you Amazon.com!  Dana L Owens

B005U9RQNU|5.0|I'm happy to say I guessed who was behind the recent spate of developments by the time the season finale closed. However, it took me until Jesse reported what the doctors said about the kid's illness to figure out who was setting up whom.  Up till then I was just on the edge of my seat wondering who was going to win/live or lose/die.  That the old bitter old man in the nursing home is used as a conduit towards final resolution is a stroke of dramatic genius. This episode turns almost entirely on Walt, Jesse and Gus. Our other characters are just very minor in this OK Corral type episode. I have no idea what they are going to do for next season as this season certainly left no cliff hangers. This finale episode was really a great final payoff for watching the entire season.

0385534639|5.0|There's not more I can say that other reviewers have not. What I can say, though, is that the book has it's monotonous moments but it's worth it and there are far more breathtaking scenes than not. I was annoyed that Celia and Marco, the two lead characters, still kept their secrets but in the end, I felt like it was best that they did keep them because their relationship was so much more than a real name or anything else like that. In the book, there is a good collection of other characters such as Poppet and Widget, twins born within the Night Circus and given beautiful gifts that complement each other. I have to say that besides Celia and Marco, I loved them the most.<br /><br />This book is complicated. There are plot jumps and some of the book is non-linear, but I think of it as a build-up. Simply put, Erin Morgenstern created literary art. This book may not become a classic like The Great Gatsby but it just might. Only time will tell, but this book made my heart sing.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't been said already on a topic with almost 1500 reviews?  I can say that I have watched them all now and that I enjoyed them very much.  I think Lucas did a fine job with remastering the originals (4, 5, and 6 espicially) and that the changes don't bother me at all.  Yes, it would have been nice to be offered the originals with no changes as an option, but the changes that were applied don't damage or detract from the movies at all.  I'm happy with my purchase.

0756405890|5.0|As the first book in the Kingkiller Chronicle, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" does a good job of setting the stage and developing the characters that will then (I'm assuming) play a bigger role in the two following books.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this book - well, the Chronicle in general - is that it is split between two different time frames. In the `present' time, the main character is an inn-keeper hiding on the edge of civilization. He is fairly happy in this new role...except that deep within himself there is a longing for the glory days of old. So he begins to tell the story of this life to a scribe who wanders into the inn on accident....<br /><br />This is where the second time frame comes in - the time frame of the past. It is in this time frame that takes up the lion share of the book as it is full of daring adventures, romance and history (the history is important as it helps one to understand the new world created by Rothfuss for his characters).<br /><br />Being a fantasy novel, there is magic and the like - only in this series, the magic is more along the lines of Clarke's third law:<br /><br />\\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\"<br /><br />In Rothfuss' universe, this means that the `magic' used by the characters are based upon `scientific' laws and principles. For example if a character wanted to lift an object using `sympathy' (one of the types of `magic'), the user would have to use enough force to lift that object regardless if they were actually touching it or not. In addition, matter can not be created nor destroyed - thereby removing some of the more unbelievable uses of magic (as opposed to `believable' magic) promoted by other fantasy books.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" by Patrick Rothfuss was a good book - great characters, great plot, perhaps a tad long...but overall alright.<br /><br />Nope, the saddest part about the book is that fact that book two was just released this year - meaning that I will have to wait three to four years for the last book of the trilogy. :(ok of the trilogy. :(
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Not because it's 30 meters water-proof, not because it has a Swiss Quartz , not because it has a solid gold band is this the best watch I've ever had. The reason it is the best watch I ever had is because it keeps perfect time, and because, at the age of 57, it has given me more fun and laughs for a few bucks than many things in my life for which I paid much more. I bought one for an 80-yr-old friend's birthday, and she too loves, laughs and wears it all the time.<br /><br />As for the watch, I'm happy with it. Mine was $14 from Amazon. I'm careful with it, though it has gotten a bit of splashing quite a number of times. Still it's perfect. I've had mine almost a year, wear it a lot, and am buying yet another for my 5-year-old grandson, who is in his dad's second wedding soon. They are wearing Star Wars tuxedos, and I imagine this lego watch will be part of his wedding gear.<br /><br />Five star!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Book Review by Harry Copeland<br />Growth of a Mockingjay<br /><br />  One of the great reads for young as well as older adults is a trilogy of novels known as the Hunger Games by author Suzanne Collins. The series of stories deal with oppression, conquest, struggle for survival, hunters and those preyed upon, deprivation, courage, and a strong love triangle.<br />  The first book in the saga, entitled The Hunger Games, introduces graphic background about a war that has left the United States divided into 12 districts, each ruled by the victors from a city called The Capitol.  Each district provides a different need of the rulers: for example, D12 supplies coal; another district provides training for the peacekeeper troops.<br />  For the last 75 years the Capitol has held arena events.  Every year two youths, one female and one male, are selected from each district to perform in a fight-to-the-death contest.  There are 24 total.  The survivor's district gets extra benefits and the survivor wins numerous accolades.  After the event, all surviving youths are sent on a victor tour of each district.<br />  In the second book, Catching Fire, the drama continues with yet another Arena Event, in which the vengeful Capitol president, Snow, has the selection rigged so that former winners have to compete again.  Snow's real strategy is to get the female victor of Dl2 into another fight in hopes she will be killed.  The teenager, Katniss Aberdeen, is gradually becoming the \\"Mockingjay\\", a rallying symbol of a growing rebellion against the Capitol's heartless oppression.  Mockingjay is the title of the concluding book in this absorbing saga.<br />  There are many exciting twists and turns in the series, particularly over whom Katniss will choose as her final love interest:  Peetah or Gale, both \\"citizens\\" of her district; and rumors of a mysterious D13 and its ultimate role in the story's resolution.<br />  The three books are narrated by Katniss, which lends a deeply personal tone and excitement to the saga.  In the first book, following the arena contest, Katniss waits in a basement-like place for her televised appearance.  By her actions in the arena at the end, she has aroused the hatred of President Snow, which explains her fears in the following excerpt from the first novel:<br /><br />  The damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me.  A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin  and I can't rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. When I left the arena, when the trumpet played,  I was supposed to be safe.  From then on.  For the rest of my life.  But if what Haymitch (her drunken mentorand a former arena victor  says is true, and he's got no reason to lie, I've never been in such a dangerous place in my life.<br /><br />  The Hunger Games books have become so popular that  four films have been authorized, with the first one to be released in March 2012. Jennifer Lawrence, Academy Award nominee for Beat Actress in Winter's Bones this year, has been chosen for the lead role of Katniss.  She won over such well-known actresses as Abigail Breslin (Zombieland, Little Miss Sunshine) and Academy Award nominee Hailey Steinfeld (True Grit).  Other actors named for coveted roles include Donald Sutherland, as  snakey President Snow; Lenny Kravitz, as Katniss's caring, brilliant stylist Cinna; Woody Harrelson, as her overbearing, unpredictable mentor Haymitch; and Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, as her two aspiring lovers Peeta and Gale.  Willow Shields will portray Katniss' younger sister Prim, whose place Katniss took in the first Arena Event.  Another character whom Katniss allies herself with in the first arena contest is diminutive Rue, a tribute from another district, whose only survival talent seems to be her speed.  Chosen for this role was Amandla Stenberg.  Suzanne Collins, the author, is one of a team of screenwriters who have written the script for the films.<br />  All three novels in the trilogy are available through Amazon. com, in hardback, Kindle editions, and a special boxed set.  I bought the Kindle editions and was very satisfied with that version because of the choice of fonts, size of print, and easy to read format.  Also available through Amazon are Gregor The Underlander series, Books 1-5, also by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />,s in the trilogy are available through Amazon. com, in hardback, Kindle editions, and a special boxed set.

0553801473|1.0|Books 1-3 were engrossing and broke so many accepted standards for fiction, in a good way. Book 4 was acceptable, but overly long for the actual plot(s) progression. Book 5 barely moves any plot forward and makes me wonder if GRRM has totally given up on the series as a whole. It seems more like he is simply writing to fulfill some publisher's obligation. Mark Twain once wrote a long letter and apologized that he didn't have time to write a short letter. That's how this book feels: GRRM didn't have time to write a a good sequel and ended up just rambling all over the place, including every thought he ever had about the story line. And to think I waited five years for this! I feel totally betrayed by the author.

0670022411|5.0|Oh mon coeur! This book drew me in from the first page and now, long after the story's end, I find myself wondering about Diana and Matthew.  Where are they?  What are they doing?  Are they safe?  Are they together?  I read all types of books, all the time, and this one has stopped me in my tracks.  I picked it up on September 23 ~ Mabon ~ and just a few pages in, I was hooked.  I am taken by the characters, their romance, their intimacy, their strength.  I loved the setting(s), from the 'rooms' at Oxford, to the castle in France, and the farmhouse in upstate New York.  I could smell the old paper and ink in the ancient texts; the crisp air mingling with fall fires, and the perfume of knowledge -- past and present -- in the libraries of Oxford and Matthew's room at Sept Tours.  A book about books; what could possibly be better?  I am absolutely spellbound by this tale.  There are several full moons between now and \\"Shadow's\\" release...If only I could time walk to June 2012.

0553805371|4.0|Being one of the most influential physicists of our time Stephen Hawking has contributed a lot to the field of cosmology over the years. In The Grand Design he once again brings the interested reader closer to understanding the universe and how it works.  Why is the universe the way it is? This is just one of the questions which Hawking tackles by shedding light on recent discoveries and theoretical advances in his field. Presenting itself as a concise survey that covers the history behind the modern view of the universe this book is written for those of non-scientific background which, admittedly, some might view as a bit too simplistic. However, it is exactly the kind of book on science, or rather physics, that a girl like me needs. Why? Because apart from being a really fascinating topic, it is highly comprehensibly written, making the quest for a unified theory of the universe accessible to the reader without causing major headaches. And both the subtle humor and the interspersed cartoons are just an added bonus.  Granted, I still can't wrap my mind around those eleven dimensions, but no one's perfect. Let me introduce you to the M-theory which is (at the moment anyway) the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe, or rather for a universe that creates itself. No creator necessary.  In short: To some the answer is 42, to Hawking it's the M-theory!  Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the NetGalley.com book review program.

1932907009|4.0|This is a really excellent book. I bought in on the referral of a novelist friend, and I've found it really useful for creating a strong plot backbone in a novel. I don't outline before writing, but I do in revision, and I find it very helpful at that stage, as well as for writing query hooks. There are a few differences between novels and movies--the text part of movies is much more simplified than books, and if you wrote your novel characters the way this book suggests, they would come off somewhat less than three dimensional. But books and movies are just different, and you have to pick out the bits they have in common when reading screenwriting books, and not worry about the rest. I would (and have!) recommend this one!

However, I would like to have seen more on George Harrison with the Traveling Wilburys and George in his last days. That is probably the major criticism I have of this book which is very well presented and typical quality product from The Beatles either as one or as individuals. The photographs are good, the text where there is text is appropriate and you thirst for more. Anyone who is a George Harrison fan will enjoy this book although not as much as I had hoped.

B003D5X3VM|5.0|I categorize jazz singers into four categories:  Those who have made it; those who never are going to make it; those who are underrated; and those who are criminally underrated.  I have previously thought the fourth category to be the largest one (and I still do).  But I had also previously thought the fourth category to be exclusively women singers.  That opinion I change.  Gregory Porter is now in that category.  But he's too good to be there for long.<br /><br />In listening to his original \\"1960 What?\\", I was struck by how much he sounds like one of the great soul singers of the 1960's - David Ruffin, Levi Stubbs, Harold Melvin.<br /><br />Yet, listening to his original \\"Pretty,\\" and the lazy way he swings the melody, leaves no doubt that he is a jazz singer.  And to put an exclamation point on the matter, he does a manic whip and scat through Wayne Shorter's \\"Black Nile,\\" the most exciting cut on the c.d.<br /><br />And although he has Four Tops- or Temptations-type power on \\"Skylark,\\" he changes his approach to sweetness throughout, as he also does on \\"Magic Cup.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Porter also is one of the most spiritual of all jazz singers.  You can't miss his spirituality in \\"Wisdom,\\" the title track, and the set-ender, a glorious a capella gospel treatment of the Anthony Newley song, \\"Feeling Good.\\"  For such a young singer from Bakersfield (home of Buck Owens), Gregory Porter is about as compleat an artist as there is.<br /><br />This c.d. garnered a well-deserved Grammy nomination.  And recently, Kurt Elling listed Gregory Porter as one of the singers he listens to.  Gregory Porter is destined to get out of the \\"criminally underrated\\" category, and quickly.  Very highly recommended.  RC
0060734191|5.0|I honestly cannot recommend Garth Nix's Old Kingdom series highly enough - it has been more than ten years since I was introduced to the first book in this series, and yet I have remained hooked ever since.  Part of the reason for this is the rich world building and highly intriguing mythos that Nix has created. For instance, the Old Kingdom (in which these books are predominantly set) is a dark, mysterious realm in which magic abounds. Bordering the Old Kingdom to the south is the country of Ancelstierre - it is the antithesis of the Old Kingdom, being driven by technology and completely free of magic (as a matter of fact, it somewhat resembles England from the 1920s!). The two lands are divided by a great Wall - even time flows differently between the two sides. One may, for instance, cross from Ancelstierre into the Old Kingdom, and find that spring has mysteriously changed to winter!  In addition, Death in itself is a realm of sorts, being comprised of a river flowing through a number of precincts (the river \\"Styx\\" from ancient Greek mythology came to mind as I was reading this). Upon dying, a spirit must pass through the nine Gates separating each precinct before finally passing beyond into true Death. However, the dead have an somewhat irksome habit of not always staying dead! What's more, when they come back to life, their natures are often corrupted and they seek to take over the bodies of the living. Thus, a lineage of anti-necromancers, known as \\"Abhorsens\\", have the task of putting these violent spirits to rest and sending them back into the river of death.  However, I feel that the main focus and strength of the series is the characters themselves, who are brilliantly written. All too often, the stars of fantasy series suffer from irritating character cliches (such as \\"Mary Sue-isms\\"). Not so in these books! The star of the first novel Sabriel, for instance, is typically strong-willed, decisive and intelligent, but also highly realistic - her actions andher vulnerabilities are very believable and, well, human. Other wonderfully likeable characters include Lirael, reluctant Abhorsen-in-Waiting Sameth, a talking dog (known as \\"The Disreputable Dog\\") - and of course, who could forget the wonderfully snarky cat, Mogget?   The first novel \\"Sabriel\\" is centred on the titular character, who is summoned away from her boarding school in Ancelstierre to come to the aid of her Abhorsen father and defeat an evil spirit that has emerged from the realm of Death to plague the Old Kingdom. The second novel, \\"Lirael\\", is set over a decade after the events of Sabriel - it focuses mostly on teenager Lirael who lives on a glacier with a race of Seers known as the Clayr. The co-star of this book is the reluctant young Sameth, prince of the Old Kingdom and also the Abhorsen-in-Waiting. Both Lirael and Sameth are ill at ease with their fortunes - Lirael is somewhat of an outcast, being the only Clayr without the gift of the Sight, and Sameth happens to be morbidly afraid of the dead! However, they are soon to find their true strengths, as they are pitted against a sinister new evil threatening the realm. The story comes to a stunning conclusion in the final novel, \\"Abhorsen.\\" I won't spoil anything - just read it!   I must say that Nix has a wonderful way of writing - there's obviously a lot of depth to his creation, but no tedium and unnecessary details, being reasonably fast-paced. Once you read one page, you are simply gripped by the adventure unfolding before your eyes.   All in all, a spell-binding journey awaits new readers!

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|This movie was the most painful theatre experience I have ever had.  I knew since first seeing the trailer that this movie was incredibly pretentious and vapid but decided to accompany my friend who is an intense Malick fan.  Had incredibly low expectations but even those did not prepare me for the 139 minutes of hell I had to endure.  I gave up trying to understand the symbolism and meaning in the movie midway through it when they started showing dinosaurs and flying though the universe.  I have never ever wanted to leave a theatre so bad in my life.  Afterwards the same friend sent me links posted by people trying to explain the meaning in certain scenes of the movie, I didn't care nor did I want to know, I was totally disgusted with this movie.

B004EPZ00W|3.0|For a person with just a passing interest in baseball, this very long film is unlikely to make much of an impression.

The \\"daughter\\" had some very good moments as did the old grizzled baseball scouts  And the chubby guy was also fun to watch.  If you're very much into baseball, this one will probably have more meaning for you, and should should not go by this review.  All others, take note.

1400064287|5.0|The SUCCESs. Not the word that counts its literal meaning, but that invisible, intangible theory where we are able to express, deliver, and stick ideas to others. In this revealing book, you will be introduced to the six ingredients designed specifically to make ideas sticky, and let me deliver what I caught from this eye-opening book.<br /><br /> Others may experience over time they develop habits that slowly erode their mind's sensitivity. The inevitable pain and disappointment of moments such as delivering your ideas at a business meeting or a conference have caused you to set up walls around your mind. Much of this is understandable. But, there's no way around the truth: your mind is out of tune with confidence it was created to maintain. As we live in community, communication is the way for us to feel the unity. The book is even greater because the authors, Chip and Dan Heath, apply their SUCCESs theory onto practical situation to help readers understand more clearly. Without the SUCCESs rule, some kinds of communications might ease our conscience temporarily but would do nothing to expose the deeper secrets we carry and deliver. And, it might be the secrets that keep our minds in turmoil. Worse, this kind of communication could actually fuel destructive behavior rather than curb it. The rules the authors explain in this book might seem the things you would feel that you already know. But, these are the things you could easily ignore. The book is a great reference to keep you on succeeding the efficient deliverability of your ideas.<br /><br />Chapter summary<br />Chapter1: Simple<br />When you needed to deliver your message in a brief and compact way, how would you prepare to deliver it to your audiences or readers? Simplicity is the key and first step to make a message sticky to others. Making it simple does not mean that you need to bring out your most important idea. It is critical to find the core. According to the authors, \\"finding the core isn't synonymous with communicating the core.\\" But, that simplicity must come with its value. Like the metaphor of a company for the employees to be encouraged, your message needs to be simple and important to make your message remain not just in your mind but others as well.<br /><br />Chapter2: Unexpected<br />\\"We can't demand attention. We must attract it\\" says the authors in the book. In order to grab people's attention, your message may be attractive with unexpectedness. Breaking a pattern could be one way. For example, the old emergency siren was too monotonic to stimulate our sensory systems and therefore failing to attract our attention. As the siren gets systematically and audibly improved, people hear much brighter and more stimulating sound and therefore being aware of some situation. In order to catch people's attention, you need to break the ordinary patterns. According to the book, \\"Our brain is designed to keenly aware of changes.\\" The more you learn knowledge, the greater the knowledge gap you would get. Because we sometimes tend to perceive that we know everything, it's hard to glue the gap. However, curiosity comes from the knowledge gaps, so these knowledge gaps can be interesting.<br />Chapter3:  Concrete<br />Humans can hallucinate and imagine what we've experienced in visual, audible, or any other sensory pathways. When we use all our sensory systems to visualize ideas or messages, then the ideas get much more concrete. As an example the authors provide in this chapter, \\"a bathtub full of ice\\" in the Kidney Theft legend is an example of abstract moral truths that makes it concrete.<br /><br />Chapter4: Credible<br />When you are a scientist, you believe more in the things that are scientifically proven or that are referred to many other studies or to the words or the theories that the well-known scientist has established. That much, credibility makes or deceives people believe your ideas. Both authorities and antiauthorities work. We present results, charts,statistics, pictures and other data to make people believe. \\"But concrete details don't just lend credibility to the authorities who provide them; they lend credibility to the idea itself.\\"<br /><br />Chapter5: Emotional<br />What's in it for you? It is a good example of the power of association. Sometimes, we need to grab people's emotion. It does not mean tear jerking, dramatic, or romantic. It means that your idea must pull out people's care and attachment to it. However, we don't always have to create this emotional attachment. \\"In fact, many ideas use a sort of piggybacking strategy, associating themselves with emotions that already exist (Made to Stick).\\" People can make decisions based on two models: the consequence model and the identity model. The consequence model can be rational self-interest, while the identity model is that people identify such situations like what type of situation is this?<br /><br />Chapter6: Stories<br />Have you seen and heard the story of the college student from the Subway campaign? He's the guy who lost hundreds of pounds eating Subway sandwiches. The story inspires people and even connects to people's real life. Like the book, Made to Stick, also presents a lot of stories to deliver and to help readers understand in each chapter, stories allow people to understand how your idea can affect or change their mind.<br /><br />Close the book and think for a moment before you start reading. How are things with your mind? Chances are, you've never stopped to consider your mind. Why should you? There are interviews to prepare for, meetings to blow others' mind with your amazing ideas, and moments you need to bring up emotional attachment with your family or your friends. If you are all caught up with these things and ask yourself this, \\"how are things?\\" \\"How have I dealt with those situations?\\" Before you go reading, you first need to dispel a commonly held myth about communication. You need to understand your old habits would die hard. And, like any habit that goes unchecked, over time they come to keep disturbing you to make your ideas sticky. Try to use the clinic part in each chapter. It will enhance your understandings, and you will improve your skills to make your ideas survive. If you really want to understand much deeper, as you read the book, look up some informative articles about the anatomy and physiology of the brain. It will help you. According to the book, your ideas must simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, and stories. Try to apply these rules into your next presentation. I was not a good organized speaker. When I adjusted my mind with these rules to prepare my presentation recently, an amazing thing happened. I am the leader of the young adult ministry of a small local church. At almost every meeting, I needed to make the members understand what and why we need to awaken ourselves and other people; they barely paid attention to what I was saying. Even they seemed understanding, but once they returned to their home or to their life, they forgot what I emphasized. However, with the rules I learned from the book, the members started showing their interests in what I say and paying good attention to it. It works!<br /><br /> Part of our confusion in delivering ideas stems from a misapplication of the rules we think we already know for persuasions. The notion that all confusions can be reduced down to a single underlying problem may strike you as a case of oversimplification. However, with the book, Made to Stick, you will track and be ready for your next presentation. When I was looking for a neuroscience book, Made to Stick was one of the recommended books related to neuroscience. The book is easy to follow, and it is really made to stick! If you are looking for a scientifically texted neuroscience book, this is not the book for you. However, this book will stir up your curiosity about neuroscience as a fundamental connector to higher neural knowledge. Simply, highlyI recommend.
140120306X|5.0|Mr. Moore's metatextual subleties are remakble. He interweaves so many elements drawn from mythology, history and literature in such a satisfactory way that it never ceases to amaze you. This is way more than just a comic book. This is modern english literature that will stand the test of time. And I'm quite sure that William Shakespeare and James Joyce smile benevolently on Mr. Moore's many endeavors from above or wherever they may be.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|i bought this to download pictures from my camera to my I-Pad. I chose to pay a few dollars more and get the real thing, rather than to get a cheaper version and maybe have problems later. I am very glad I did. I have downloaded many pictures from vacation, etc and have had NO problems. I very highly recemend this this attachment. I recieved it in only a few days. I love Amazon.
B0036TGT3E|1.0|This is a review of the 3D disc only. The 3D is nicely done, much better than I expected. However there is a major problem. I legally own this disc and it won't play on my computer with PowerDVD. The Disney copy protection if OVER THE TOP! I am a major geek so I was able to break the copy protection and play my disc, but the regular human being that wants to watch on their computer is going to be very disappointed. Shame on you Disney, don't you know if the pirates want to copy this, they will? Now you're cutting out the legitimate purchaser who wants to watch it with their kids in 3D.  What a disappointment to have to waste an hour with an anxious kid hanging around wanting to know what's wrong.  All that aside, we loved the movie.
B004WE01YA|1.0|I can't believe Disney release such trash. The 3D was very poorly done. Normal Blu Ray looks better than what they did to the 3D release. I won't buy another previously released Disney movie redone in 3D. Do NOT buy this movie!
0525423281|5.0|From my blog Never Gonna Grow Up! Reviews:<br /><br />LOVE.<br /><br />Okay. That's an understatement. Let me start again. I literally hugged this book with tears in my eyes when I finished.<br /><br />LOVE<br />LOVELOVE<br />LOVELOVELOVE<br />LOVELOVELOVELOVE<br />LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE<br />LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE<br />LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE<br /><br />What? You want more info than that? Okay, fine. Lola is a crazy awesome teenage girl who is a budding fashion designer. Her life is pretty great. She lives in a nice neighborhood in San Francisco with two loving fathers (even if they are really strict) and has a rockin' hottie for a boyfriend. Everything is going pretty great until figure skating star Calliope Bell and her twin brother Cricket move back in to the house next door. Cricket crushed Lola's heart two years ago. She thought she had gotten over it, but all those feelings come rushing back, along with Cricket's tender smiles and warm heart as they get reacquainted. Can they simply be just friends or were they destined for something more?<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with Stephanie Perkins, then shame on you. Do yourself a favor and go get her book Anna and the French Kiss right now (my review, podcast interview). I seriously cannot rave enough about her writing. It's charming, intelligent, and oh so romantic. I don't usually like contemporary fiction, but I adore her writing. You really connect with the characters and fall in love with the cute boys they love. It just can't be helped! Ms. Perkins is the master of writing about cute boys. Cricket is my favorite one so far. (Sorry Etienne fans, but I love Cricket's sweet and slightly nerdy personality!)<br /><br />If you're looking for a witty, well written romance, then this one should definitely be on your \\"must read\\" list. Warning: Your heart may turn into a puddle of warm goo and you may find you want to re-read this book over and over again. In fact, you might just want to save yourself some trouble and order 2 or 3 copies right away. :D<br /><br />I received an ARC from the publisher for review.er for review.
B005BZQS1E|4.0|This movie gets a worse rap than it deserves. But if you can accept it for what it is - a carefully crafted, self-aware, tongue-in-cheek but obviously affectionate paean to silly 80s fantasy-adventure movies - it's pretty fun. Actually, it's a lot of fun. I will concede however that, given its reliance on the viewer's familiarity with this genre, the movie is probably not amusing to many folks outside of the male 25-35 age group.
0140067477|5.0|This is most definitely not a kids book.  Instead it is an excellent analysis of Taoism told through the stories of Pooh Bear.  I have read it several times and bought multiple copies for gifts.  It is an excellent read for anyone interested in philosophy, Taoism, or just wants an interesting and fascinating read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive and easy to learn - two requirements I personally look for in a puzzle game. The puzzles are challenging but not to the point of frustration. Great game.
0307477479|1.0|I've seen this merchandised everywhere -- every airport, every book store -- and even heard Jennifer Egan read a chapter at a writers' conference.  The book starts off incredibly well; I'm drawn in to Sasha's struggle, care about her.  Then I'm mercilessly jerked around from character to character, from technique to technique, until the narrative is lost, my patience is tried, and the characters are but post-it notes on the author's plot whiteboard.  To add insult to injury, the last chapter (which belongs in a Shteyngardt book anyway) is the description of how a post- post-modern marketing infrastructure sells a substandard creative product to a gullible audience based on back-scratching commercialism.  Hunh.  Sounds familiar.  I'm intrigued by the Sasha of the first chapter.  I wish someone would write a novel about her.  All in all: too smart by half.
B002CLBJPK|4.0|Very good movie. Bought this one to replace a vhs one that has stopped working. Would recommend this for anyone to show to their children.
030788743X|5.0|Is it the lure of nostalgia or simply the epic feel of Ready Player One that makes it so deliciously entertaining? It is perhaps, a bit of both. Ernest Cline playfully reminisces while offering up a heady eighties banquet in his futuristic piece about a quest to end all quests that jet-propels the minds and hearts of readers from the very first page.<br /><br />I can still remember the very first time I saw Star Wars and Tron, the first time I delved into books that epically moved me...Watership Down, The Hobbit, Neuromancer, Holy Fire, Heart of Darkness, even Harry Potter...diving into Ready Player One, with my haptic gloves, visor, and OASIS immersion rig was no different-an absolutely electrifying and unforgettable experience.<br />Cline manages to convey a bit of prescience in his portrayal of the world that Wade Watts lives in...a virtual world that is more comforting than a bleak future, where millions grow up in the OASIS, through its schools, its libraries, and its simulated cities and towns-all digitally recreated-its seamless worlds-within-worlds offering up a never-ending adventure. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Clines' futuristic grail quest takes off when the creator of the OASIS and owner of Gregarious Simulation Systems James Halliday dies, thrusting the entire planet into a frenzy (much in the same way Steve Jobs' demise did).<br />Within the OASIS, Halliday has programmed clues to unraveling a treasure-his treasure-roughly two hundred and forty billion dollars' worth and a controlling interest of the most powerful company on the planet. All are at stake and up for grabs. One only needs to have an excellent knowledge of the eighties, the background of Halliday's life memorized, and an unbeatable strategy to unravel the scavenger hunt-like clues hidden within the OASIS.<br /><br />Cline plays up his inexhaustible eighties references, as Wade Watts does his pasty-white-best to unravel the clues to three keys left by his idol Halliday-whether it is acting out the scenes in War Games, playing Joust, Dungeons of Daggorath, or playing a perfect game of Pac Man (which is still on my bucket list) on top of competitively racing against thousands of gunters bent on finding the keys for themselves. At their heels an evil multinational company lurks in the wings willing to do anything, include kill, to get at all three keys.<br /><br />Cline manages to craft a formidable opponent out of the Sixers, those cretinous suits from innovative Online Industries (IOI) bent on sussing out the keys for their own motely gain and the inevitable control and monetization of the OASIS.<br />With the emergence of the Sixers, Wade must pit his smarts and knowledge against them, and band together his friends and fellow gunters worldwide. With Wade's selfless perseverance to save the spirit of the OASIS from the Sixers, Ready Player One becomes ceases to be a quest and morphs into a worldwide mission.<br /><br />Instead of the billions at stake, the very life blood of the OASIS is threatened and the unified front that Wade and his teammates drum up conjures up visions of every epic fictional battle fought: the war of Middle Earth, the Battle of Endor, Luke Skywalker launching his torpedo into the Death Star's reactor...to Cline's Battle of Chthonia and Castle Anorak all thrust the reader from apathy to become a part of something greater. Cline has managed to imaginatively deliver the most essential ingredients to a great story or movie in a shiny, new, wrapper: charity, hope and faith.<br /><br />Ready Player One is striking, unstoppable and epically good. There are so many good and genuine aspects to Cline's novel that I don't even know where to start.<br /><br />Cline's peek at the future is believable at times with a hint of wry humor (i.e. the Portland Avenue Stacks where Wade lives...is freakishly comical...and yet just a bit sad) Who could imagine poverty-stricken families scraping out a meager existence in RVs stacked high in the sky? Visually it's like the Jetson's in HELL or the great garbage avalanche of 2505 in Idiocracy (2006).<br /><br />As is his reference to a C-section (cutting an OASIS user out of their apartment and haptic chair) nearly made me roll on the floor laughing and Wades' stint as an IOI indentured Tech Support employee was insanely good, (almost as good as his maniacal plot to somehow crack the hold of the Orb of Osuvox over Castle Anorak).<br /><br />After reading Ready Player One FIVE times, I have to say without a doubt it's been the best book I've read all year. Hopefully, Ernest Cline will channel Yoda's last words \\"...there is another Skyw-...\\"  and deliver an equally geek-worthy sequel.<br /><br />Bravo! Parzival Lives!<br />A Fiendishly Bookish Review05 in Idiocracy (2006).

B001GZ6QDS|1.0|Unfortunately this Batman movie was one of the worst that I have ever seen.  The first movie with Michael Keaton was the best and it has steadily gotten worse over the years.  First the casting was completely unrealistic.  The love interest of Batman and the District Attorney was \\"Rebecca\\" played by Maggie Gyheenlhall was not cast properly.  She's not good looking at all and borderline ugly, she's a poor actor and she had no significant role, she was just thrown in there.  The police commissioner and the mayor of Gotham were too young.  Morgan Freeman did not sell me as a techy.  Alfred was cast and portrayed properly.  Furthermore the movie was too long.  It last about 21/2 hours but could only fill 2 hours with substantive material.  The dialog was very boring and I fast forwarded through many sections.  The positive aspects of the movie was the special effects, the stunts, the cinematography and the equipment that Batman uses.  The only good actor was Alfred, the commissioner and maybe Batman.  I was very disappointed.  The Character \\"Rebecca\\" was the most disappointing.  Not worth the purchase
0316113506|3.0|Full disclosure I did not finish reading the book as I got bored with it and found it repetitive.  I ended up giving it to a friend who said he thoroughly enjoyed reading all of it.  Overall I just could not handle re-reading the same info written in a different way.  Bottom line is that physical exercise is good for your brain/mind development.  If you don't mind reading that statement written a couple hundred different ways then you may really like this book.

1575666286|5.0|Dr Gerson published medical papers in Germany on his results curing cancer. His therapy  is still being used, world wide,  with similar results.  He moves to the US, and is branded a quack and they refuse to publish new papers.  His cure is too simple.  Plus it seemed to cure everything.  Well for someone with cancer, taking 11 glasses of fresh juice every day would not be that simple. I am sure they would need help.  Also the method of pressing the vegetables, and squeezing the juice through cheese cloth seems very hard for a sick  person to do.  Some might have to use a simpler juicer, against the recommendations of the book author, just to keep up.  Sometimes you just have to do the best you can.<br />You have to read the book for the details, but my take on it is that his method floods the body with antioxidants.  So of course it is good for more than just one condition.  When you read in the newspaper, or magazines, about eating foods high in antioxidants, does it say to do it to help with just one health condition?  No, of course not. It can help in many ways.  No snake oil treatment here, just sound medical advice.<br />There is a video documentary on Dr Gerson, that is a must watch.  Parts of it are available on utube.  I got it from my video service. It gives both sides, interviewing people who were not familiar with the therapy, but who branded him a quack. Also interviewing doctors who used the therapy successfully, and who had no doubt that it worked.<br /> I know Dr Gerson testified in congress about his work, and they were impressed enough to try and pass a bill on funds for cancer research. It was narrowly defeated after much opposition from medical lobbyists. Why the opposition? Could they really think that research could put doctors and drug manufacturing out of business?  That does make sense to me. Unless maybe one small cancer drug company was in a panic. Or maybe the lobbyists were hired by people who believed he really was a quack. I always thought that people who condemn something with out investigating it, are fools.  Dr Gersons original book was published years ago, before he was murdered. Also, an attempt was made on his life while he was writing it. Someone knows who killed him and why.<br /> The cure rate achieved for certain cancers was about 70 percent. It is not a guarantied 100 percent cure. He had positive results where others failed. Names are named in the book of people cured, and you will recognize them.  According to the book, chances of going into remission were much higher using the Gerson therapy, than with chemo.
0743504984|5.0|I very much enjoyed the Band of Brothers Audio CD set.  I had read the book and own the mini-series. I listened to it in my car and thoroughly enjoyed doing so as much as I enjoyed the book.
1849386684|5.0|The Beginner's Songbook is an outstanding compliment to the easy to use Beginner's Course hosted by Justin Sandercoe at justinguitar.com. The entire course is easy to use and expertly taught. Unlike so many other guitar songbooks the justinguitar.com beginner's songbook explains the strumming patterns and builds up to the intermediate level. Apparently there will be an intermediate songbook coming in 2012 so I am anxiously awaiting it's release.   Excellent job Justin and Jed!

B001MYIXAW|5.0|If you have not seen this film yet go out and buy it, rent it, stream it, etc.  It is not a children's movie even though the main characters are 13.  It is not the run of the mill vampire story (ie Twilight or True Blood).  Instead it is an excellent re-telling of the entire genre.  The book is even better and is one of the few times I recommend seeing the film FIRST, then read the book after.  If you do see this film go with the subtitles.  The dubbing is absolute horrible.

I saw him on the Today Show promoting this CD, and from there I looked it up and listened to the samples and just had to get it.  It's a great CD and the transaction, as usual, was great.  I hope he'll make more CDs, too!
1906694176|4.0|The last of three very good books - I like the fact that it is in Sweden and we get a feeling of life there.  It arrived very quickly, and I did not want to wait for it to be published here in the USA - watch the movies (Swedish) after each book.  Also good, but the book is better (as always)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Dear Reader,  Absolutely fantastic picture quality for these classic movies.  If you started with Beta/VHS tapes and moved on to DVD, you'll know what I mean. The purchase of this collection is the next best thing to being there.  The only thing that can beat the quality of these movies are possibly 3D Blu-ray or other technology that hasn't been invented yet.  I highly recommend this collection!  Klamm.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|I liked and enjoyed the effects but that's about everything entertaining about this movie. The quality (blue ray on ps3) is pretty bad ass.<br /><br />Story line is very mediocre and no depth at all. The acting was sad at times.<br /><br />And most importantly I missed Megan Fox, someting just wasn't right with the new big upper lip girl. Maybe with Megan it would have been a better movie? Guess we will never know.
B00006IW17|5.0|X-Men is a great film to watch. The D-VHS version of the movie is a rare find. If you like theater excitement in your home, this is the movie to get in High Definition VHS.
B00466HN86|5.0|If you have a chance to see this movie on the big screen...DO IT! It is worth every penny of the theater ticket price. I've already seen it twice and would go 20 more times if I could. It is inspiring, and touching with a beautiful message that ALL men, whether they have children or not, need to see. I have never sat through a movie for 2 hours where I have laughed, cried, and been in suspense and received a message at the same time. I can't wait to own the dvd. God bless the Kendrick brothers for this amazing movie. It's my new favorite!

0307477479|2.0|My book club loved this book.  I couldn't help but feel that I was back at college, trying to hang with the hipster crowd and finding out that my leggings weren't the right shade of black.  I just don't get it.  I think Ms. Egan is a good writer, perhaps she will mature into a great writer after she gets over her need to prove that she can use every writing technique in the book to create something original.    The book opens with Sasha, music producer Bennie's assistant.  She turns out to be a through character of sorts.  From there, Ms. Egan takes us on a wild ride.  Time and place shift and suddenly, we're back in Bennie's childhood.  We follow Bennie and Sasha throughout their lives, with side trips into the lives of other characters.    I love a great character and this book had several to choose from and the scenarios Ms. Egan created are amazing.  These are the things that I love in a great book.  I WANT to stay up all night because I just have to know what happens.  This book, I didn't even finish because there was no real need to finish it.  Ms. Egan randomly tacks dénouements onto chapters throughout like post it notes.  There may have been a pattern to it, I just didn't care to thumb back through the book to find out.  I had already turned back so many times to find out who this character was or reread something.  All of the devices and shifts in voice were too distracting.  It was like pretending to enjoy a bad performance art piece because the New York Times says it's \\"groundbreaking and edgy.\\"  By the time I got to the chapter that was written entirely in power point presentations (I'm not kidding), I was over it.  The overall effect of all the techniques and devices was that it felt like someone's writing class experiment.  Did I appreciate what she was doing?  In an intellectual sense, yes.  But it didn't make me want to read the book.  Michael Kors told one of the Project Runway designers (oh yes - I'm throwing in a Project Runway reference but only because it's relevant) that a great design doesn't need a lot of accessories but a bad one does.  Ms. Egan should do some editing and yank off a few bracelets because I don't think she needs all the accessories.  There's good stuff here, it's just so bedazzled.  A straightforward story might not impress those in black leggings but in my opinion, it is so much more satisfying.
1423140591|4.0|I personally like some of Riordan's other books better, but this one still has the same style and elements that have made his work a must-read. Hunger Games and The Octobers are slightly above this one in my opinion. But don't pass this one up.

B004GGM444|1.0|I've been around the musical block a few times. I listen to all kinds of music and such, be it The Beatles or Radiohead or Eminem or Scratch Acid. But this stuff is just...gross. The vocals that do pop up, are always high pitched, like some sort of chipmunk on speed. If not for that, it'd probably be decent. If you'd like an idea of how dubstep SHOULD sound, refer to Bassnectar's remix of Ellie Goulding's song \\"Lights\\". That is what dubstep COULD be, but because no one has the nuts to actually sing, it'll probably stay like this. Bummer.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is an amazing watch.  Technically I would give it a 4 1/2 stars, unfortunately that isn't possible, so I give it 4 stars.<br /><br />First of all, this watch does everything. It comes with a very comfortable and accurate heart rate monitor.  The watch itself comes with three interchangeable bands depending on what you like.  I prefer the more athletic friendly velcro strap.  It comes in a large and small size I believe, and the small one is perfect for my wife, the large one is perfect for me.  This GPS watch is deadly accurate and comes with many customizable options that is too much to list here.  Some of my favorite features include:  it keeps your pace and adjusts itself accordingly depending on your speed.  If you want to run at a certain speed or pace, this thing works perfect to let you know how you are doing.  It also has a feature where it shows if you are behind or ahead of your goal pace, telling you in time and distance, a fantastic feature.  It calculates your distance so you know how far you have run.  You can set up modes to burn a certain amount of calories and a number of other options.<br /><br />Also, this thing wirelessly hooks up with included ANT stick that connects to your computer, and downloads all activities to the garmin website.  This website is amazing as it gives you all your activities in a calendar view.  It shows your track on a map, your calories, distance, pace, elevation, everything.  It really is a great tool that is free with the watch.<br /><br />My one complaint for this watch is it isn't waterproof.  A bummer for me.  Also, I sweat a lot when running.  At times I have found it hard while running to switch between screens with the touch buttons.  They are touch sensitive.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  The benefits of this watch far outweigh that minor setback.  Also, if you don't sweat a ton and don't need to switch screens while running, this won't pose a problem.<br /><br />Other than that, a great watch that has many other features I haven't begun to explore.  A must for a runner!explore.  A must for a runner!
1573229725|3.0|After reading the raving reviews this book received, I just simply had to read it especially since I'm familiar with Sarah Waters's writing. I tried to love this book, it is a fairly long read with a lot of twists and turns. I found myself loving some parts but hating others. However, there were some events that needed farther explanations and some characters that were never fully developed and their choice of actions never fully exposed. Although it is a 500+ book there were some questions left unanswered although trivial but for a plot so thick and detailed of some importance. However, those weren't what bothered me most while reading the book, so don't think that is why I rate it 3.5 stars instead of 5. The Plot was well crafted even with those small question marks but sadly the characters especially the main once were two-dimensional. Given each character's background their actions may come not as surprising but I was hoping still that the author would give them *more* slack. They could've used their heads more, there were some decisions Sue made that just enraged me. I found myself wanting to shake her for being so naive, gullible and weak. I felt the same thing towards Maud. They came across as underdeveloped and dependent for the most part, that when the change finally comes its too late. As a result the lesbian romance is also weak. It didn't add anything to the plot, I understand this isn't a romance but the relationship between Maud and Sue could've been handled better without overshadowing the story. Instead we understand the characters feel a sort of attraction towards each other but we never get much insight into it. The sad part is the love story had potential to add the plot and it didn't feel contrived just lacking.<br /><br />The secondary characters on the other hand ranged from serving as distant plot devices to almost three dimensional. However, they're mostly unlikable, vicious and creepy characters that I found myself hating. They are the once who make the choices that are never fully explained.<br /><br />I was disappointed partly, because I thought the plot was excellent and this could have been a masterpiece of a book if the characters were better drawn. Not a bad read by any means but I would get it from the library first I'm definitely in the minority here so chances are you might like this book better than I did hopefully. On my part I'm trying to give an honest review some of the reviewers will tell you that this book has disturbing contents and while it is indeed dark and grim I didn't mind it much. A lot of people were surprised and shocked at the first plot twist, I personally saw it coming from the moment I picked the book up.<br /><br />-Happy Reading !who make the choices that are never fully explained.<br /><br />I was disappointed partly, because I thought the plot was excellent and this could have been a masterpiece of a book if the characters were better drawn.

0553208845|3.0|Siddhartha by Herman Hesse<br /><br />I read this short novel of 167 pages for the second time, after a gap of about 17 years.I did not really remember much about it , except that it is a spiritual book and is related to Gotama , the Buddha.<br />Herman Hesse  had written this book in 1922 in German , and only in 1951, it was translated by Hilda Rosner , and was published in the USA then.It became very popular in the USA in the  sixties and still continues to be in circulation .<br /> Hesse divided the book in two parts.The first part with four chapters was dedicated to Romain Rolland.The second part , with eight chapters was dedicated to Wilhelm Gundert.Hesse took a long time to write the second part.<br />The hero of the book is Siddhartha, the son of a Brahmin ,and lives in India during the time of Gotama , the Buddha.He is restless since his youth to find the meaning of existence .He also wants to find out how to reach the state of true joy , or Nirvana. He practises meditation , fasting an self-denial by becoming a Samana(ascetic).But he is  not satisfied .He wants to take a new path and decides to go to Gotama.Here too , the life of a monk does not satisfy him .But he believes that salvation does not come through the teachings of another , even if these are by Gotama.It comes through your own search of innermost part of self, your own experience.<br />Siddhartha gets a variety of experiences ,of lust , greed and riches .He goes through life in a child like manner , at times even animal -like .The name of the game was Sansara,,involving love , women , children, honors , money , plans , hopes and pleasures.But after a time , Siddhartha realises that he could not play this repetitive game called Sansara , over and over again .He decides to go to the forest and stays in a hut , with a ferry man .He tries to mould his son in his own way but realizes that his son needs freedom , like he needed when he wanted to become a Samana in his youth .<br />x x x x x x x x  xx  xx x xx x x x xx x x x  x x x x x x  xx  x x x x x x x  x x x x xx x<br /><br />After reading the book this time , I asked myself this question.\\"Did Siddhartha realize the meaning of existence.?If so , what was it?Did he find inner peace, or Nirvana?\\" I have several doubts .May be , Siddhartha made a compromise with his soul and decided  not to explore or  gain experience any further.Was it possible to find this meaning and peace , as an individual , without participation in the affairs, challenges  and activities of  family and  community?Is diverse and wide ranging experience essential to reach the truth of existence?Should there be not a limit  to the freedom of gaining experiences of diverse kinds?I did not find answers to these in the book .<br />But still ,the  book is thought provoking , though does not really provide answers to many questions .

B00005N6KG|2.0|INITIAL PURCHASE 2011- Good headset!  it's very comfortable,  has good sound quality, and is much easier to clean than ones with rubber/foam ear pieces.  I have bought 4 sets, in the last 7 months.  Not as replacements, but so I wouldn't have to plug/unplug with my different music sources.  My only complaint is that wire tangles- like all ear pieces.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE 2014-  Apparently Sony stopped making these, leaving what's left to scalpers. The price has jumped from UNDER $10 (2011), to OVER $60 (2012)<br /><br />If anyone know of a good alternative, I'm interested.

B004J4WLB4|3.0|I bought this book because I was mildly familiar with the language of flowers from a booklet I'd found at my grandmother's house many years ago. By the end of the book, I was sick of hearing about the language of flowers and found the importance the author and characters ascribed to their meaning to be overwrought. I thought the heroine might come to the realization that the recorded meanings are just symbolic, whereas her own feelings and those of the other characters in the book are real, sincere, and not always possible to be represented simply. Instead, the book's references grew increasingly frequent and heavy-handed.  The book started out well enough, but in the second half the plot began to show holes that I found hard to ignore. The romance with Grant was relatable, but the ensuing pregnancy was both predictable and idealized. I found it hard to believe Victoria was able to start up her own wildly successful flower shop while pregnant, relatively friendless, and living in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. The nursing passage was well done, but it seemed a little out of place with the fantastical nature of the rest of the book. It seemed like the author drew upon her personal experience for a few parts with authentic results, but the issues she wrote about that she did not have experience with rang false.   In the end, all the loose ends were tied up in a way that I found unrealistic and trite. A story about a foster child should be a little more savvy, in my opinion. I think it would have been possible to create a happy ending with some lessons learned, but without doing a disservice to all the readers who know just how the garden really grows.

0553801473|5.0|I was entertained.  I would give 4.5 stars if possible.  It was not as thrilling as the first three but for someone following the series, I think there was a lot of development and character building. While I would not be so willing to kill off a character unless it really serves the plot line, I will just enjoy Martin's writing, without questioning his motives.  After all, the story is not done yet and who but the author knows how one event may have a pivotal significance on the next part of the story.  Some of the \\"surprises\\" didn't shock me, but seemed a bit out of place or timed a bit peculiarly. In consideration of the enormous size of the book, I'm talking about a couple of minutes worth of events out of a very long story.  I think the moments that felt like: \\"huh, did that really just happen?\\" left me just a tiny bit irritated with the events rather than shocked at certain deaths. I am hoping that the deaths enhance the story somehow.  Also there was no suspenseful build up before these certain events happened, and that is why they may have seemed out of place.  They were abrupt, and one, or two of them seemed a bit pointless, or perhaps destructive to future components of the story. Other than those things, the book was an amazing piece of narration and story-telling, which I found highly entertaining. I find the three star reviews a bit silly, since they were probably based mostly on angry responses to a few events towards the end of the book (the ones that I just mentioned, but took with a grain of salt.  Since I have no intention of writing any other spoilers, that's it for my review. It was a good continuation to the story, well narrated in the audio version, and excellent for a long daily commute.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I was never really a fan of the first 3 films....so I was skeptical in going to see this one. And I LOVED it! I went to see it twice and bought the film the first day it came out.

B001NY9YJA|1.0|If there is one band that truly doesn't deserve their success, it would be Limp Bizkit.   Now don't get me wrong, I listen to and enjoy a wide variety of music, ranging from Cake and System of a Down to Dr. dre and Eminem. However, this is hideous music.   First of all, the 'beats' are, for lack of a better word, truly and utterly wack. To my understanding their creative process consists of recording a sixth grade orquestra and cymbal crashes on a tape recorder. Then ripping the tape up and patching it back together randomly. The music is simply incoherent, upon first listen I believed this album consisted of hundreds of different minute long songs. I guess thats what happens when a song has no chorus  That brings me to the lyrics. There doesn't appear to be a single rhyming line on this album. A rough estimate would place this album lyrically next to \\"wall mart\\" by Mr. Ghetto (google it). Despite this being a partially rap album, rhyming might not matter, had the lyrics been quality. Portions of this album sound like the trinity killer's stream of conscious, the rest are muted by walls of noise.  I bought this album off of a $1 cd rack, and I can honestly say that it was a waste of money. \\"Faith\\" was the only song with a coherent line in it, then it descended into silence followed by the obligatory wall of noise. Seriously, there only needed to be one good song on this, and it would have been worth the money.  It is a mystery as to why this album has gotten any good reviews.
B000FJGDS4|5.0|THE AVIATOR is a superior biopic directed by Martin Scorcese. It garnered 11 Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Supporting Actress (Cate Blanchett), also Art Direction, Cinematography, Costumes and Film Editing.<br /><br />This nearly 3-hour epic covers the life of Howard Hughes from his 1927 arrival in Hollywood to the first and only flight of the largest airplane ever built, Howard's so-called \\"Spruce Goose,\\" in 1947.<br /><br />DiCaprio is outstanding as a man whose progressive OCD ultimately disables him and causes total withdrawal from public view. Despite her Oscar, Blanchett is miscast as Kate Hepburn. Beckinsale is a stunning Ava Gardner, Law can't carry off an Errol Flynn impression. The \\"Hell's Angels\\" flying sequences are absolutely spectacular.<br /><br />Marvelous recreations of old Hollywood, fine unobtrusive CGI special effects and a top-rate cast make this the sort of movie that's worth repeated viewings.

B004ZN9NCY|4.0|\\"Ummagumma\\" is an odd sort of combination album; it became common in the late 1960's/early 1970's to release a double album with the first album being a live album and the second a studio album but the second disc here is really an album of solo performances by the band.<br /><br />The live disc is certainly worth it--and unlike what is listed the live disc IS newly remastered for this edition. It is a pretty good representation of the band's live performances of the time. The remaster sounds extremely good for both discs with an improved bottom end for the studio disc.<br /><br />The studio album is a mixed bag; featuring what amounts to only two complete songs (\\"Grantchester Meadows\\" and \\"The Narrow Way, Part III\\")with the rest made up of Rick Wright's keyboard noodling (\\"Sysphus Parts 1-4), acoustic and electric guitar instrumental work out by David Gilmour (\\"The Narrow Way Parts 1-2\\") an instrumental by Roger Waters and a pair of instrumentals by Nick Mason that feature a variety of percussive instruments augment by an orchestra. The studio album is less than the sum of it's parts and while it features a number of interesting experiments it isn't completely successful.<br /><br />Disc 1- 4 stars/disc 2-3 stars<br /><br />Worth picking up for the live disc.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|This story is about a daughter learning about the true origins of her father by being surreptitiously made to read her father's diary. Her father is Mr. Benjamin Button who is \\"born under curious circumstances\\": born old and aging backwards. Themes of family, the purpose of life, unfulfilled love, fate, end of life and death were principal to the plot with fate being a major element. But the portrayal of key relationships was not sufficient to match the message. Noticeable was the amount 'dark' scenes: there was an air of perpetual night. Overall the story is a wonderful reflection on living, love and relationships. Unfortunately the greater messages of the movie are much undeveloped or contradicting. It was unfortunate that the beauty of the picture was complimented by these incomplete relationships and messages making the movie wonderfully incomplete.<br /><br />The theme of fate is the source of one of many comparisons to Forest Gump, but unlike Forest Gump a review of destiny is mostly encumbered so as to be disguised. The comparisons are fair considering that the movie is essentially filled with vignettes of key relationships in Mr. Benjamin Button's life and the philosophical, moral and spiritual lessons he adopts from each. His reverse aging almost appears as a secondary or tertiary theme compared to the attempts to philosophy the meaning of living. I would compare this movie to a cross between Forest Gump and A River Runs Through It.<br /><br />Revealing the summary knowledge and wisdom of these supporting characters often felt manipulated and palpably advertised so as to lose emotional effect. At other times thought provoking message were distracted by titillating interactions. It felt as if `sex' was being use to attract attention to the message which it was obscuring. There was an abruptness to many of the key messages of the film which was in part due to a lack of depth in key relationships. Exemplary of this is the depictions of the relationship of Benjamin with his father. Also curious were the reemerging past relationships which seemed awkwardly placed.<br />____________________________________<br />I found many of the messages contradicting. One contradiction was that of accepting ones fate (Artist Captain), but then being unwilling to deal with the consequences of his life by living out his life with the love of his life despite is reverse aging. I found similarities and contradictions in that his daughter was easily made to forgive him for abandoning, something which he was unable to do with his own father. His moral character only stood when he was with the love of his life (Paris Gazebo), otherwise he found little contradiction with using women to fulfill his needs..

B005QYKE2Y|5.0|Transformers 3 proved to be an awesome conclusion to the the series.  It was full of action from start to finish, with scenes that made you grip the armrests of your chair, much better than the second movie's action scenes.  It makes some good connections to the other movies (what was Megatron doing in space anyway when he crashed and froze?), and in a summer where a lot of sci-fi movies integrate themselves with historical moments, I congratulate Bay for his clever integration of the moon landing with the Transformers.  Some new faces too; Shockwave = awesome, Laserbeak was one of the few memorable Decepticons, and they replaced the Twins from the 2nd movie with a far better pair of Autobots (the Wreckers)!  A good conclusion and an enjoyable movie.   Oh, and one more thing: Alan Tudyk once again proves he's full of win and hilarity. :)
B005G0YP3C|4.0|I still hate the cover after all these years but the music is still glorious. The new remaster for \\"Three Friends\\" is the first time that the original mastertape has been used for a CD (the CBS/Sony copy has been used for every copy domestically since it's first CD issue).[[ASIN:B005G0YP3M Octopus]]has also been reissued by Alcuard, again, for the first time from the original mastertapes.<br /><br />How does this sound? This remaster is closer to The Beatles remasters than the previous remasters (for good or bad--if you like the 2009 Beatles remasters, you'll like this, if not you probably won't). This edition also has two bonus track--a 6 minute slice featuring bits and pieces of outtakes/rehearsals for \\"Three Friends\\" as well as a 1972 live performance of \\"Prologue\\" which runs over 5 minutes .<br /><br />What's the best version out there? Detail IS better here and clarity is slightly improved over Eroc's remastering with similar dynamic range (and if you want a flat transfer the original Japanese pressing--not the most recent reissue by Universal--but the mini-sleeve version from 1996 is the closest you'll get to that but it is also drawn from a copy of a copy of the safety master and, like the Columbia original CD, the indexing is incorrect on one track).<br /><br />The indexing error that has plagued every version on CD since the original Columbia CD has finally been fixed here.<br /><br />Bottom line: For clarity and detail THIS version does beat just about every other version although Eroc's remaster is quite similar sounding. The dynamics here are fairly decent especially compared to most current remasters so it really comes down to how sensitive you are to louder masterings.
034544678X|4.0|This book is well worth reading.<br /><br />This is a story of MAN more than DOG. It is an expose' into our human behavior through the shared experiences we have with our dogs. The text encourages us to be moral, generous and cognizant of our actions on the living things of this world, using the familiar love of \\"man's best friend\\" to inspire a genuine regard for living things in general.<br /><br />I found this to be a clever approach to encouraging 'US' to be good stewards of the world we dominate, especially those animals with whom we share the world.<br /><br />I think the best summary of this book is in the final chapter which describes coping with the death of a loved pet, an event which brings together the summary of all that it is to share your life with another individual. Is there love and loss? We theorize because conclusion is beyond our species to communicate, but, it is evident to most who have lived to the completion of their pets lives or observe a pet cope with the loss of its human that there is something special in sharing life together, species indifferent.<br /><br />________________________<br />Indicative of this work, located in the `Afterword' is a quote by Henry Beston from `The Outermost House' which says \\"... They are not brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth.\\"<br /><br />The author continues the thought with, \\"Love is not the same thing as understanding. ... Of course, it matters greatly that people ...understand enough about them (dogs) to provide a good environment for them. ... But there are different levels of understanding, and ... Perhaps there is value in relationship that strives to share what it can and that accepts, deeply and peacefully, its limitations.\\"<br /><br />\\"Our distinctiveness separates us and makes it easy to forget where we came from. Perhaps dogs help us remember the depth of our roots, reminding us - the animal at the other end of the lease (US) - that we may be special, but we are not alone.\\"that we may be special, but we are not alone.\\"

B00000ADG2|3.0|I got nostalgic when I thought of buying this CD off of Amazon. A classic Hip Hop Album, so when I saw the cheap price, I jumped on it. I buy stuff from Amazon all the time and have always been cautious. Right off the bat I noticed the copy of this cd had a \\"Return to Library\\" tag on it. Basically, I think someone got this copy from the library and sold it to me. Many scratches on the disc, and I havent even tried to play the CD. I guess I'm not mad, cuz it was so cheap.

B005G0YP3M|5.0|I've owned at least four CD versions of \\"Octopus\\" over the years (not including the vinyl)and this edition has to be one of the best out there. Remastered by Fred Kervorkian for the first time from the original mastertapes (the previous editions used various copies and/or safety masters), this edition has nice clarity, depth and, more importantly, decent dynamics but having said that this isn't the most dynamic of all the releases.<br /><br />It's a tough call as to which verison is the ultimate edition of the album. The Japanease mini-sleeve released from previous years was a flat transfer; Eroc's remaster from a couple of years back while it used a safety copy of the master (and may have used the same copy that was used for the U.S. edition of the album) had a bit less dynamic  range but featured very pleasing EQ choices that improved the sound of the album. Kervorkian's remaster (supervised by Ray Shulman)likewise sounds good and this remaster reminds me of what was done (the good stuff)with The Beatles remasters over in 2009--the album retains much of its warmth in the latest edition although it should be noted it is peak limited and a bit more compressed than previous editions. If you want a flat transfer with little to no tweaking of the material the Japanese first edition, U.S. Columbia might be good choices and the Line isn't bad either.<br /><br />We get a bonus track from a 1976 performance of various bits and pieces of \\"Ocotopus\\" that the band would do providing a condensed \\"highlights\\" version of the best tracks from the album. This was pretty common for the band to do by this time (and, in fact, there's another version of this on their double live album). It's a nice extra to include for fans although I would have preferred perhaps full versions of various songs.<br /><br />The packaging is quite as as well. The album is presented in a digipak with the lyrics printed on the inside (like the original gatefold sleeve for the world except for the U.S.) and even includes the image used for the U.S. cover on the inside for completists. We also get an eight page book with comments from the band about the making of the album as well as vintage photos and memorabilia from the time.<br /><br />Each version has its merits and drawbacks.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005G0YP3C Three Friends]] has also been remastered from the analog mastertapes for the first time by the band.even includes the image used for the U.S. cover on the inside for completists.

B00003CXA2|4.0|I came into this film rather skeptical. The subject matter was of no interest to me and the rave reviews seemed overly optimistic. While this dvd will not be gracing my shelves, I am forced to admit that this was a remarkably put-together piece of entertainment. It kept my interest from beginning to end, with plenty of laughs, surprises, and excitement. Note, however, that this is the ClearPlay review. The cleaned up version takes out the nudity, the violence, and the profanity which would otherwise have seen this film in the garbage, if I had seen it. Happily, I did not, and as usual, the film is much better without this stuff. Even still, there are quite a lot of themes inappropriate for children (or adults for that matter). This film does not paint a pretty picture of the past few decades, which is perhaps why many people don't like it. Personally, I think it was just brutally honest. Being told from the perspective of a \\"slow\\" person gives the filmmakers that liberty of telling the story with a child's simplicity and honesty. The truth is, life wasn't good then, and it isn't any better now, 17 years after the making. But this is not a film meant to depress. The comedy succeeds thanks to Tom Hanks believable acting. Does he act accurately as someone who is \\"slow\\"? Probably not, but that wasn't the point. This isn't a treatise on a medical condition. The film bravely tackles almost every key issue of the times, leaving the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions, and thus is not \\"mindless\\" as some have accused it of being. This is an engaging, entertaining, enlightening film, and if you have ClearPlay, I highly recommend it. If you don't . . . well, that's why I only give it four stars instead of five. Definitely inappropriate content in here.

0307454541|4.0|An undeniable page-turner; `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a genuine find, a novel that deserves to be read and debated and read again.  Debate is a word often associated with this novel, considering that many find the mania surrounding the story to be rather unwarranted.  There is considerable hoopla thrown in the direction of this trilogy.  The Swedish films made quite a splash here in the states, not to mention their homeland.  `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' film made a big dent here, even when awards started to roll around (for a foreign language film to get nominated for awards in the US, it means something) and the sting of the controversy surrounding the death of the author, Stieg Larsson, continues to loom over the overall impact and reception of the franchise.  There is a lot of critical words used in detraction of these books and their subsequent films (which are currently being remade by American author filmmaker David Fincher), but where there is negativity there are equal amounts of praise and adoration being lumped on them as well.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is that `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' isn't going away anytime soon.<br /><br />My personal feeling about this novel (I have yet to read the second and third novels, but they are on my reading list) is one of overall satisfaction.  There are some obvious faults here, most I chuck up to the translation (being translated into English from the original Swedish text could have caused the wording to suffer a bit).  There is some dialog that feels cheesy and underwritten and some wording that feels amateurish, which is off-putting when the bulk of the novel is so compelling.  I also felt that Larsson had an issue with editing himself.  He tried so hard to flesh out every character and every backstory and every side plot that he wound up writing long passages that took the reader out to the immediate action and into another world almost.  He wrote it well (honestly, those pages just fly by) but I can't help but think that there were a lot of details he didn't need to include.  That said, when you are finished you certainly feel as if you know THE WHOLE STORY, and I understand (especially from having seen all three films) that those details will come in handy as I delve into the second and third novels.<br /><br />So I guess I can't fault him too much for that.<br /><br />The story here, or at least the central story, focuses on a missing persons investigation.  Journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who has just been sentenced to serve a prison term for libel, is hired by an aging millionaire, Henrik Vanger, to find his missing niece Harriet.  She has been missing since the 60's and the case was close (cold) decades ago, but Henrik has been haunted by her disappearance and now that he is near death he is determined to find her.  He is convinced that someone within his family (he hates them all) has murdered her.  Mikael is skeptical, but the offer eventually persuades him (his interest is certainly pricked) but as he gets deeper into discovering the truth he finds himself way in over his head.  Then we have Lisbeth Salander, an introverted analyst working for a security company who is hired to do a background analysis of Blomkvist and finds herself intrigued.  She is tormented by her own past (carefully guarded in this particular book) and so she winds up taking part in unlocking this mystery alongside Mikael.  Salander is an odd girl, but one that is complex and intriguing.  She dresses in Goth and looks like a boy and yet she possesses an edge that makes her sexy.  She acts rather slow and yet she is far from dumb, and while she vents her frustrations in often violent and confrontational ways, she is undeniably vulnerable and emotionally wounded.<br /><br />Honestly, the universal consumption with this character is well deserved; she is that unique.<br /><br />While it has been noted that certain aspects of this prose lack originality, and the general consensus is that this is a generic crime novel, there is one aspect of this book that cannot so easily be generalized; Salander.  She is the heart and soul of this book and she makes her presence known with sheer strength and identity.  Say what you will about the overall `impact' here, but I must admit that there are few novels that have engulfed me the way that this one has.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down.aspect of this book that cannot so easily be generalized; Salander.

B0045HCJRQ|5.0|I really liked this movie-ALL of the acting was splendid. Richard Gere and Jodie Foster have an incredible chemistry.  Set in the south of the United States just after the Civil War, Laurel Sommersby is managing to work the farm without her husband Jack, believed killed in the Civil War.  Jack Sommersby was not a pleasant man,so when he returns, Laurel has mixed emotions. It appears that Jack has changed a great deal, leading some people to believe that this is not actually Jack but an imposter. Laurel herself is unsure, but willing to take the man into her home, and perhaps later into her heart... She knew his face. His touch. His voice. She knew everything about him... But the truth.   As the story progresses,and Jack and Laurel fall more deeply in love then ever.  Favorite line for me was: \\"\\"\\"\\"I told you to use the fertilizer in the fields, Jack.\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"\\"  A movie worth buying and watching!

B001MSMUH0|1.0|I saw a TED presentation Ken Robinson made a few years ago.  He had mentioned that he was publishing this book which talks about how people found their passion and defy our conventional education system.  I bought this book right away, hoping to read inspirational stories of people who found and pursued their passion. While these examples were in the book, I found the book contained too much Academic BS. First, too much emphasis was given on defining everything.  For example, \\"Academic BS\\" is frequently used by university students to try to \\"bulk up\\" their papers.  Most professors often specify how long they want a paper to be.  If a professor said he wanted the paper to be 10 pages, students are often faced with the task of filling the pages with \\"words\\" even if it only took 4 pages to convey the message. This book could have been 1 / 4 the size it was.  Just my thoughts on the matter...

B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Jack Reacher is back in Lee Child's sixteenth book [[ASIN:B004P8JPS6 The Affair: A Reacher Novel (Jack Reacher)]].  The book details Jack Reacher's final days as a military policemen in the army, while investigating a murder in a small town called Carter Crossing, near an army base, Fort Kelham.  It is an interesting story, although a little inplausable at times, but still greatly enjoyable, especially for those that are keen Reacher fans.  I wouldn't recommend this book as a starting point for people interested in the series; a prior knowledge of [[ASIN:B000OZ0NXA Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, No. 1)]] is needed to greater appreciate some of the background (though relatively unimportant) points of the story.  I also enjoyed the references to how some of his quirky behaviour that is evident in older books came to be (for instance his love for the foldable toothbrush), as well as how he thought his life was going to be like outside of the army.  These points are small, and have no impact on the overall story, but I believe that it makes the Reacher character much stronger and interesting, especially for future books in the series.  As for the writing style, it is Lee Child as we know him.  The story flows wonderfully from chapter to chapter, all in the first person perspective of Reacher.  This isn't anything new from Lee Child, but it is refreshing, as most books in the series have been in the third person.    Overall, The Affair is an extremely enjoyable addition to the Jack Reacher series.  It may not be the best story in the series, but it is well written, and will be interesting to those that have always wondered how it came to be that Reacher left the army.
B005CM9DX6|1.0|Seriously, 5 stars for this album? There is no way in the world this album deserves 5 stars. Opeth is one of my favorite bands of all time, and I believe they are one of the most creative, talented bands out there. I never cared for the death growls, but I learned to live with them and appreciate the music and excellent song writing. I loved how Opeth could write songs that were crushingly heavy one minute and gorgeous w/ clean vocals the next. So, when I heard they were writing a new album with all clean vocals, I thought it would be a masterpiece.  But, after listening to this album over 20 times, I have to say that it is an utter disappointment. I mean, really, how self-indulgent can you be? The Devil's Orchard and I Feel the Dark are the only songs worth mentioning on this noodling, unfocused mess of 60 minutes. I tried to let the album grow on me, I really did, but in the end I found myself falling asleep trying to get through it. Looking at the two bands closest to Opeth in the progressive metal/rock genre, Dream Theater and Symphony X, and their recent releases, this album seems like an epic fail to me on so many levels. What happened to Opeth? This album doesn't sound anything like the band I fell in love with a few years ago. This sounds like 70's prog rock, and a bad copy of that at best. Back to the drawing board.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|If you liked this show you'll like the box set! I for one picked up on a lot more things watching it again! Amazing writing, talented cast, funniest show on TV, hands down.
B004EPYZTE|5.0|I've been a fan of Conan my entire life. I've read the books, comics, seen the movies, and even the three tv shows. I was going to write a big long review about how much I loved Momoa as Conan. How his ever move and every line oozes Robert E. Howards Conan (he has the Conan scowl down perfect). I was going to go on about how great all the action scenes are, and believe me there are A TON! I was going to tell you about the amazing locations, set pieces, and the many great and classic Conan quotes. But I'm not going to. Chances are if you are reading this you're a Conan fan. And if you're a Conan fan and you haven't seen this movie yet than shame on you. If this movie took all of it's awesome, turned it into a giant fist made out of its awesome, and then punched you in the face, you would surely die. But here's the kicker, even though you died from a punch to the face of awesome, you would have at least seen a friggin awesome movie. Man I love me some Conan.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|As with almost any literary adaptation, fans of the source material in search of a literal interpretation will probably find a lot to fault in this Will Smith vehicle, particularly in its neutered take on the story's conclusion. All of the original's deeper underlying meanings are still there, buried in the actions and expressions of the transfigured creatures Smith does his best to avoid, but without a big reveal to lay all the cards on the table they're too easily shrugged off or overlooked altogether. That positions this as, basically, a hybrid summer blockbuster / suspense-laden monster movie with a better than usual premise. In this role it fares well - Smith portrays the terrifying isolation of the last sane man on Earth with passion and depth, leaving memories of his less-inspired earlier work far in the past. He's come a long way from Independence Day or even Hancock, and surprisingly little of that has the more stern-faced, serious script to thank. Legend's computer effects are a different story: while exceptional at rendering an overgrown, deserted NYC skyline, they feel excessive and overwhelming when it come to the creatures themselves. Though it may not live up to the lofty expectations of its namesake, this is hardly a complete write-off. In fact, as mass market action pictures go it's unusually smart, expertly paced and generally contemplative. A pity it didn't have the balls to stick with that original ending, though, as I think it would have been much more universally appreciated.

B005974CNA|5.0|Yep, they accomplished it! They managed to deliver one of their best albums ever after losing Mike Portnoy (who I consider to be one of the best drummers of the last 20 years) and former leader. The new drummer has all the licks that Portnoy has only with slightly diminished power (at least on the studio CD). Portnoy has a little more punch, but it is barely noticeable as Mike Mangini easily covers the sacred ground. Jordan also shows a little more of his phenominal keyboard work on this one which also elevates the work to higher levels. The CD starts out with the incredible \\"On The Backs Of Angels\\" which flatly states what we have to look forward to with the current state of planet earth and it's controlling ignorance of evil leaders who are pushing us all to the brink of disaster. It feels real because IT IS REAL! Great song - period. It is followed up by the equally powerful \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" and \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\". My personal favorite track is \\"Bridges In The Sky\\" because it has such a majestic feel to the chorus. Awesome! Just the kind of thing I would hope for from a band with such expert musicianship. Every song on this CD is inspiring and worth many listens and the band really seems to be enjoying themselves playing this material. There are alot of favorable reviews here, and this is just another one, but I would very much recommend this to any of my friends or those interested in great music. I hope that this is a sign of more great music from the Dream. We love you guys!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I bought this on a whim, I like Anthrax a lot, but to be honest, they never cracked my \\"big three\\" of thrash (Megadeth,Pantera,Testament). Part of it was when Joey left and was replaced by Jon Bush. Let me be clear, I love Jon as a singer..his work with Armored Saint is exemplary. But I never really bought into Jon as the singer of Anthrax. I felt that when Jon joined, Anthrax began to sound a bit generic, and drifted away from the fast thrashy melodic, even tongue in cheek, format that they created. I like the Bush-era CDs, but not nearly as much as much as the Joey Stuff. I guess a good comparison would be Hagar Van Halen vs Roth Van Halen...a matter of preference.<br />Having said all this, I LOVE Worship Music!! I find myself cueing it up on the iPod with suprising frequency. The band is tight as ever, and there is some pretty impressive shredding too. Most of the songs are Vintage Anthrax, and others are different but just as great...\\"I'm Alive\\" is suprisingly melodic, almost sounds like 3 doors Down playing a thrash tune. \\"The Constant\\" is a fine tribute to Pantera (very \\"5 minutes alone\\" sounding).<br /> highly recommended! As I said I prefer JOey's vocals to JOn in Anthrax, and I'm hoping to catch them on tour in a few weeks!!
B003X27L9U|4.0|An incredible tale. A story you couldn't possibly forget, essentially any person's worst nightmare except it's the lead character's whole life. I love that it was written from the little boy's point of view, you'd think it would make it cheesy but it just worked. Beautifully written and an eerie eerie tale.

0071762345|5.0|One of the things I enjoyed most about the book is the strength of the writing, and how surprisingly accessible it is. I've been working in online marketing for 10+ years so there's a lot in here that I know, but also a lot that I imagine will impact and help me develop my online marketing plans for the next 10+ years. What's more, I've passed the book on to others who are considerably less technical and web-savvy than I might be, and they \\"get it\\" immediately. Bravo Dave, on a terrific and informative read.

I would have preferred a new book as I was promised in the description!
B0057OOPXM|5.0|The Sundazed mono CD has a few competitors from the past.......<br />1. An old imported 1988 CD with both the stereo and mono versions present that I haven't heard. Supposedly excellent.<br />2. The Mobile Fidelity release with both mono and stereo versions. It's been too long since I've heard this one. Good sound but poor booklet presentation from memory. Now quite expensive.<br />3. The UK Deluxe Edition with stereo and mono versions + bonus tracks -  fantastic idea spoiled by maximized and distorted sound. Notice it hasn't been manufactured ever in the US. Unusual for such a popular title. The regular stereo Universal CD sounds better in stereo and 2, 4 and 5 sound better in mono. The booklet is fantastic.<br />4. The Audio Fidelity mono - this is quite good but not as good as I'd hoped because of a lack of heft. The bass frequencies appear to be shelved down for whatever reason - unusual for an Audio Fidelity release - but the rest of the frequency range sounds very good. Revamped photo presentation modernises the cover too.<br />5. The Sundazed mono - simple original cover presentation with the CD manufactured to look like the original mono album label. A photo of the RCA Red Seal master tape in the gatefold of the digipak. It sounds like what I wanted from the Audio Fidelity - great bottom end without the distortion of the Deluxe Edition. Terrific sound and my favourite for the mono. The only version that gives an indication as to why John Mayall preferred the mono mix. Given this CD, I'd say that the mono here and the Universal US stereo remaster are about on a par.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is not a easy book to review. And the reason for the difficulty is because it is such a great work of fiction and there are just too many things to spoil in the story if I start reviewing the contents. And I pity the people who are spoiled because Time.com is correct - George R R Martin is the American Tolkien.<br /><br />I stumbled upon this series through a internet forum talking about the new HBO TV series, A Game of Thrones. I was fortunate because people were talking about how excited and giddy they were that a TV series is being made. This is a forum full of mature, sensible adults and to see them raving like a group of teenage kids intrigued me enough to purchase the Kindle version of this book.<br /><br />The moment I started the first few chapters, I could not put this book down. Every chapter that I finished, I give thanks that I have not heard of this series and thus was not spoiled by the story at all. On the other hand, another part of me was kicking myself. Where was I in 1996 when the book was published? Did I live in some deserted island or what?<br /><br />In a way, I was glad because I still have 4 more books to go! I don't have to wait years for the next one.<br /><br />If you like fantasy - if you are a Robert Jordan, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, David Eddings and of course, Tolkien fan, you MUST NOT miss this series. If there were ever a fantasy book to rule them all after Tolkien, this is it!
0880793589|3.0|This is sold heavily as a useful companion tool to the book [[ASIN:0446404667 A Whack on the Side of the Head: How You Can Be More Creative]].  Von Oech has an invested monetary interest in moving this item, and he hypes it hard in his original (and useful) book on creativity.  If you are a single person, just buy the book and forget the deck of cards.  You can approximate the deck by opening to a random page.  Useful in brainstorming meetings with multiple people, provided the people using the Whack Pack in the meeting are actually receptive/helpful, and not Dilbertesque managers or marketing people.  If I ever sit in on another D&D campaign, I plan on using this deck for strategy decisions.  But it only shines in a group setting, and even then the tool's impact is minimal, in my personal experience.  Was a creative thinker before reading Oech's book.  Sometimes a small push means a breakthrough, though I haven't seen that from this product.  Yet.    If you are a big corporate manager and will try anything to jump start your million dollar creative team, then the cost of this deck is great investment.  If you are a small one-person operation, buy the original book and pass on the cards unless you really love the book.

B005G4TJUC|1.0|Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a movie I regret having purchased. It is an empty, heartless film; to watch it is to devalue your life a little.<br /><br />Director Michael Bay has made only two good films: The Rock and Armageddon (the latter is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest, this horrible (and third, if you can believe it) Transformers movie, is his worst film ever.<br /><br />Bay simply does not work well with CGI, and especially during action sequences. I am reminded of The Rock, and the expertly-directed car chase scene. The explosions, the shattered glass panes, and the upturned trolley were all practical effects. They were executed during the shooting of the film, not added in afterwards by an overpaid visual animation nerd.<br /><br />Bay's quick cutting works well in his aforementioned two other films. However, in this latest Transformers movie, the cuts provide only confusion and an unwelcome sense of unwieldiness.<br /><br />As for the acting, well, there is none. The good guys are all good and the bad guys all bad. I felt nothing but shame for serious actors like John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and John Turturro. We all need a paycheck, but to stoop this low is reprehensible.<br /><br />The other characters--the main characters--are irrelevant. They basically yell and scream much of the time. Oh, and Shia LaBouf's character's girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitely) sure is smoking hot.<br /><br />But there's no emotional connection between any of these characters. Bay's attempt at making me give a damn about \\"Bumblebee\\" or \\"Optimus Prime\\" fell flat, to say the  very least. I do not have feelings for a car that turns into a giant, ugly warrior robot. Call me crazy.<br /><br />Transformers: Dark of the Moon amounts to 154 minutes of pure, unadulterated vapidity. Life is short, people; to waste two and a half hours of your existence on a film like this is a crime.

Because of this, I get to enjoy reading Book 1-5 in a continuous flow, not being interrupted by years of waiting for the next book.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords, Book 3, is perhaps the greatest work in A Song of Fire and Ice. If we drew an exponential chart, Book 3 is the peak of already a very top graph. There are many plot twists here and much will be revealed. Everything you knew or thought you know are thrown up, in a good way.<br /><br />Sadly, the series slowed down in Book 4 and 5. I hope these two are just stage setting for an even greater Book 6. Let's hope Martin will not pull a Jordan!

1401223176|2.0|I was introduced to Jeph Loeb (and artist Tim Sale) in a couple of comic series: Batman: The Long Halloween and Superman All Seasons. Both series were extremely well written and easy to read and understand, Jeph Loeb turned out to be one of the few writers in my watch list.<br /><br />So when I saw that Jeph Loeb had teamed up with Jim Lee to do a Batman piece, I was extremely excited and bought this graphic novel without thinking twice. A great story teller with one of the most influential and greatest comic artist - no brainer, right?<br /><br />It turned out to be a mistake.<br /><br />Batman: Hush is made up of 13 comics. It has similarities to The Long Halloween in that the whole point of the story is to find out who is the mysterious villain, Hush. The first 12 comics see Batman on a wild goose chase from Gotham City to Metropolis to find out the identity of Hush - and it is not your typical wild goose chase from a good detective novel. No, this is a disparate mesh of story lines and characters, most of them unrelated, trying to gel together a dramatic story. It has failed terribly.<br /><br />If I were to analyze how Hush has failed compared to Jeph Loeb's earlier work, I'd say that he was probably `star struck'. Star struck by Jim Lee/Scott Williams. Instead of Lee's art telling the story that Loeb crafted, it became a slide show of Lee's art gallery. Instead of a story, we have scenes being set up so Lee could craft a beautiful piece to wow the audience.<br /><br />Why else would you see a host of villains and Bat-friends being involved in this story? We see Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Riddler, Harlequin, Joker, Ra'al Ghul, Clayface, Two Face (Harvey Dent) and Catwoman, Superman, Nightwing, Robin and Huntress. Someone in DC is obviously twisting Loeb's arm to make sure he give Lee a chance to depict all these villains and heroes.<br /><br />The art is nice, no doubt. Lee's take on many of the characters and scenes are really nice. But, sadly, many of his character (body and face) are like cookie cutter. They all have the same `dreamy' eyes and same body build up. They are all made of cookie cutter. Case in point, Commissioner Jim Gordon looked like Superman with white hair and spectacles who looked like Batman who looked like Harvey who looked like Robin. You get the idea. I was looking back to Loeb's Batman The Long Halloween and marvel at the variety of characters in there, all drawn with different mug faces and body shape. Some are skinny, some with long face, some really fat guys, big build mobs, etc. So, I am disappointed that Lee's character doesn't really stand out at all.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a book of Lee's art, get Hush. If you are in for a story, buy The Long Halloween instead.the same `dreamy' eyes and same body build up. They are all made of cookie cutter.

I haven't been this amped up about a rock band since Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth, etc. These guys are an avalanche of sound, bolstered by technical musicians who know how to create monster riffs. This is their best album to date, and a righteous follow up to the phenomenal \\"Crack the Skye.\\"   Highly recommended.

Sound quality when using the transmitter part is not as good when using a direct connection (USB or headphones to input) Quality seems well built. The fit in the 12V outlet is VERY tight. Have to make sure and grab by the plug and not the unit. I could see pulling the unit clear off the plug part. When USB plugged in to charge and using input jack for the music, it keeps saying searching USB. Would be nice to have a way to just charge while using input jack.

0425220931|4.0|This book is a philosophical treatment of how to become a better musican.  It will be most enjoyable to those who play bass(as Victor is obviously a bassist), and most useful to jazz payers, as opposed to those who focus on rock or classical, where improvisation is less emphasized.  I would say that if your mind is not open to this book, it is probably not open to music, either.
B003ODHOA4|4.0|Although I admit the book could use better formatting, I think the author picked up the essence of street language versus what we are taught in Mandarin class.  I know many of the phrases and laughed out-loud remembering learning them. Those I didn't know, I'm trying out with Chinese friends and teachers.  I have purchased the book for some of my Mandarin teachers as a gift. Some think it's funny and some don't want their students to learn slang. But they all admit it  is current. Like much slang, it will probably be out of date soon and DOES reflect certain slang used in only certain province areas of China. Remember - these don't work everywhere !!

0066214122|5.0|In evolution, the little guys always win. In his famous previous works, Crichton focused on the big creatures. This time, it's the little guys turn.  For dinosaurs, the evolution process operates slowly over hundreds of thousands of years. But what about microscopic organisms?  In quickly reproducing life forms, like bacteria, evolution could potentially occur in a matter of weeks. If evolutionary change occurs incrementally from one generation to the next, wouldn't it be an evolutionary advantage to have more generations in a given period?  In other words, all else being equal, the more generations you have, the more quickly evolution happens and the more quickly simple organisms can become complex.<br /><br />Prey is a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the tech business and a cautionary tale for unbridled research. As humans, we have limits to our intelligence and problem solving. We can only make so many incremental advances over a period of time. Crichton proposes a new way of making quantum leaps in our technological advances. Crichton uses `emergent behavior' as the impetus for transcending human limitations in problem solving. He surmises a complex adaptive system model of a natural phenomenon where simple structures working together in a dynamic process. For example, individual cells interact to form differentiated body parts, ants interact to form colonies, neurons interact to form intelligent systems, and people interact to form social networks.  Emergent behavior is comparable to the infinite monkey theorem, where an infinite number of monkeys hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. But who has an infinite number of monkeys? How about an infinite number of manufactured nanobots that demonstrate emergent behavior over many generations despite limited memory and limited shelf-life? The key for getting a bunch of dim-witted particles to act in concert is the concept of predator-prey dynamics. In Prey, an infinite number of nanobots can use simple algorithms as rules and basic swarm behavior as a model to problem solve their way from dust in the wind to the top of the food chain. Crichton provides an appreciation of the highly organized, orderly behavior that emerges from systems composed out \\"agents\\" behaving in accord with very simple rules. However, he also heeds warning to venture capitalists who exploit the power of human reason through the science and technology. For Crichton, the actual laws of nature always lie beyond the control of human beings while human greed and curiosity lead to destruction and chaos.d particles to act in concert is the concept of predator-prey dynamics.

B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie was not produced to win any awards.  It has accomplished what it set out to do and that is to entertain and set up the next movie (The Avengers).

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I read \\"Born to Run\\" more than a year ago in hardcover (rather than Kindle, which is my new medium of choice)and am just now getting around to writing a review. The fact that McDougall's work remains on my mind after all this time attests to its quality and impact. McDougall has become known largely as prophet for barefoot running, but I believe that understates the depth and merit of what he brings to the reader, runner and non-runner alike.  I've been an avid runner through most of my adult life and I've long thought there are important philosophical and spiritual dimensions to running that the running magazines largely miss. By examining the historical experience and perspective of the Tarahumara Indians, MacDougall illuminates new angles and purpose, and ones that have since enriched and informed my own runnning experience---not because I've abandoned traditional running in favor of the barefoot variety (I haven't, although I have started to do more shoeless beach running in the summer) but because running, at its very best, involves transcendance above the ordinary and the constant press of mortality.  I congratulate McDougall for a path-breaking and original book and recommend it to anyone who runs or is considering starting---without or without shoes.

0385534639|5.0|Not everyone will love this book like I did. It is imagery heavy, and impatient readers who aren't able to deal with the sometimes extravagant prose may find themselves losing interest quickly. However, the language is beautiful and the world well described, so if you're the type of reader who wants to truly SEE the world of the author's imagination down to the olfactory stimulation, then this is a book that I can doubly recommend for you. If you are like me, and somewhere in between, it is still definitely worth checking out.  This is a modern love story, and tastefully done. It is NOT a cheesy romance novel, with drawn out scenes of \\"mush\\" if you'll forgive the expression. Instead, Morgenstern chose to focus on the world she was building, the cast of interesting characters, and bringing you the reader into the circus with some imaginative second person writing pieces interspersed among the books sections.   I have read a review where someone complained about not being able to tell who to \\"root for.\\" Apparently to them there were no clear lines of good/evil. I find this argument silly. Good and evil is not always clearly defined. However most readers should have no problem deciding for themselves who is in the right, who is in the wrong, who the victims are, and how evil is never done for the sake of evil. It is in fact the LACK of obvious ill intention that makes these characters so interesting. Evil is typically banal when you first meet it. E.g. Hitler didn't rise to power by being an obvious evil madman, but now, he seems to be a representation of evil incarnate in popular culture today, and for good reason.  It is this \\"realistic\\" flavor to the novel that kept the characters three dimensional and believable. Realistic, as far as a fantasy novel is concerned with realism obviously.  The novel is much more than a love story. It is a story about two approaches to the world, it is a story about free will, and it is, above all else, a story about magic. I loved theworld crafted by Morgenstern's words, and her concept of magic stands out as unique. I especially enjoyed the dynamic of the two main characters' diametrically opposed methods of employing the abilities they have.  If you like fantasy and magic, a well written love story (which are in my opinion far too rare), and you can either tolerate (or relish depending on your personality) the flower description, this book is a definite must. It is an original work, and well worth the read. I can see the potential for great discussions coming from the questions raised by Morgenstern. That alone makes the book worth a read.

0385486804|5.0|Even though I usually read the book first before I see the movie, this case was different. I was caught by the film documentary from Sean Penn about Chris mcCandless a few years ago and it is still on my mind every other day. Especially in these times when the world is absorbed with financial crisis and the potential of losing money and other materialistic fears, this is the perfect answer for those who want to go back to the core and find the real source of happiness.   This sounds controversial for a story whereby the character dies in the end, but it's necessary to look beyond and be open to the message that this intelligent young men wanted to live by. Aside the compelling epic about Chris mcCandless and his quest into the wild, this book will provide more in depth insights and information and summaries on comparible events in Alaska and elsewhere. I've read it in a few days and I have made the promise to myself to chase happiness rather than focussing on getting more and more in the future. Not is a similar drastic way as Chris did, but if everyone would focus on people, family, friends relationships the world might just be a slightly better place to live in.  thanks Chris and John.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read a lot of books (2-3 per week) and I have to say that this is one of the most well-written books I have read in a long time.  I had been hearing about this book series for a while and, tending to resist what's \\"in\\" at the moment, I skipped over this series for a long time but finally gave in.  I must say, I'm so glad I did.  Although this book is considered young-adult, it's good for those of any age as I am 28 and was recommended this book series by my 60-year-old aunt.  I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the Kindle edition changes font sizes a few times and, while slightly annoying, it wasn't a big deal and it stopped doing so about halfway through the first book.

B004ZNARH4|3.0|I have been a fan for 48 years. Have over 30 bootlegs (collectables)and maybe 100 other studio CDs. I was highly anticipating this set, but like other comments here I was disappointed when I opened the box. Nothing really 'new' to me here. I have most of these versions already. But one thing that kinda got me upset was the 'three' marbles. Why not four or five. I can only assume that they represent the three surviving members.<br />I will order the other two 'sets' coming out. 'Wish you were here' and 'The Wall'. simple because I love The Floyd and wish to relive my youth and turn my children on to their timeless music.
B002OG5GT8|5.0|I got this amp to go with a set of Koss DJ100 headphones.  These were my first real quality headphones, and I have read some suggestions that say that a headphone amp is a good thing to use with them to help fill out the bass.<br /><br />This amp doesn't really seem to make the music much louder overall, but it definitely fills it out.  The lows especially seem more full and accurate.<br /><br />Overall, for the money I feel that it does a good job of helping out the sound with my headphones, and I would recommend it to someone looking to fill out the sound a bit.
B0050PYNN0|2.0|This film is essentially the story of two brothers and their companions going on a quest to rescue a damsel in distress and all the mishaps and encounters that go along with it. The sets, special effects and cinematography are quite good however it's the corny, moronic and utterly crude script that totally ruins this movie. Why do producers today feel they have to use excessive profanity, vulgar themes and depravity to make a film funny ? Are we as a society that dumbed-down that we need filth in a movie in order to enjoy it ? I think not. I'm no prude but there were scenes in this film that were disturbing and utterly disgusting. Child molestation, rape and sodomy are just a few of the themes that rear (no pun) their ugly head in this film. What sick mind of a screenwriter would think this would be funny ?   As for the actors, well they do the job and are capable if not uninspiring. Natalie Portman looks bored and appears to be phoning in her role. It's a wonder she would actually agree to appear in such a low-brow film. Integrity doesn't seem to matter with some actors I guess.   Other than the above, this film has a few good points. The issues of self sacrifice and determination are key themes in this film together with companionship. These are the only \\"good\\" elements of the film which are ruined by the distasteful (and unnecessary) foul language. Worth a watch but is not a film for kids or adults with a low tolerance for moral depravity.
140120306X|3.0|Reviews are all over the place about this entry in the saga of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, with many claiming it's just flatly incoherent. I didn't find it so--in fact, it was surprisingly straightforward as a narrative, though there's no question there are more digressions with no immediate apparent pertinence than in the first two series. Most are worth the while, though it's hard not to wonder if Moore could have spent a little less time on them (one reasonably captures the deceptively airy style of P.G. Wodehouse, while another, which is unfortunately near the end, bogs thing down with an interminable beat reflection on certain events) and put a little more thought into the conclusion, which, while visually fascinating, pays off story-wise with much the same anemic pompousness as Robert Heinlein's wrap-up in The Number of the Beast.

1589795474|5.0|This book is an eye-opener.  I read it once, and listened to the audio book many times.<br />The basic idea is that millionaires aren't the people you think of, those people are usually very high income earners, but spend so much on their lifestyle that their actual value is sorrowful, and people who are actually millionaires make much money, but live normally.<br /><br />Even knowing the message, it is worth reading.

1609611543|5.0|There are others who have done a thorough review of this book, so I'll not repeat them.  Suffice to say, that with all the volumes of scientific research that has been written regarding nutrition & grains, Dr. Davis does an admirable job of succinctly and with good humour - presenting the data and his clinical observations.  If you would like futher validation on the dangers of wheat/gluten grains - \\"Celiac Disease, the Hidden Epidemic\\" by Green & Jones\\", might be helpful.     That our most cherished food is also ONE of the primary causes of ALL of our modern diseases may be distressing to many... the scientific evidence exists and is well worth your attention.  ALL modern diseases (cardiovascular, metabolic/diabetic/hormonal, cancers, automimmune) are strongly related to systemic inflammation.  The \\"cause\\" of that inflammation has been elusive.  Probably due to the \\"wild goose chase\\" that we've been on due to the ever popular \\"fad\\" notion that \\"fat\\" particularly \\"saturated fat\\" is bad for us.  Unfortunately, the healthy saturated animal or plant fat was probably the one thing that was protecting our systems from the onslaught of increasing grains, legumes and carbohydrates in our diet.  Now, I do not make these statements base on any belief system... this issue of nutrition is mulitfactoral and metabolically rather complex.  That means don't throw rocks until you've done your homework .... if you found Dr. Davis' work \\"DISTURBING\\", \\"THOUGHT PROVOKING\\", 'WORRISOME\\" OR \\"REALLY EXCITING\\" .... if you really are interested in being healthy, eating healthy or just proving him (or me) wrong - there's a few more books to read, before you've any base from which to criticize:  the \\"short list\\" of recommended reading- \\"The Perfect Health Diet\\", by the Jaminets; \\"Deep Nutrition\\" by Shanahan, MD; \\"Primal Body, Primal Mind\\" by Gedguadas; 'Why We Get Fat\\" or \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" by Taubes AND \\"The Vegetarian Myth\\" by Lierre Keith. Additionally - These concepts of \\"Paleo', \\"low carb\\",\\"indigenous/primitive\\" nutrition are now represented in the terms \\"ancestral\\" or \\"evolutionary\\" health, diet, medicine - as the first annual symposium which occurred Aug. 2011 and the presentations can be found on [...] and provide much \\"food for thought\\".  Dr. Davis is in the company of some great writers/researchers.      As a clinical physiologist, who has worked in the field of chronic disease management my entire career (30 yrs of cardiac, pulmonary & diabetic)- I have watched my most compliant & fit patients fail on the low fat/high carb & grain diet, exercise until you drop routine. Like Dr. Davis, I now follow and support following a wheat free/grain & legume free diet.  Until you remove these foods completely, for 4-6 wks, you really won't know if you are sensitive.  While weight loss seems to be the most important thing to most folks - excess fat storage is simply a symptom of inflammation and insulin/glucose dysfunction that leads to diabetes or heart disease or cancer or auto immune disorders.  However, you do not need to be obese to have those problems.  I am and have always been fit (previous competitive athlete) and thin (BMI 20) and always ate organic whole foods, high grain/legume diet but that did not protect me from insulin/glucose dysfunction or overt inflammation (fibromyalgia).  Getting off all grains & beans and limiting my carbs to 200 kcals/day has worked beautifully for 2 years.  Yes, low carbohydrate - the issues in systemic inflammation are directly related to an interplay of nutritional factors.  In reality, it is the rare Homo sapiens (probably in the range of 20% of the total world population) that can \\"thrive\\" on high carb and grains.  We can survive but the current health status is quite indicative of the lack of tolerance.     As for staying on the nutritional program - all I can say is - It's the most pleasurable way to eat that I have ever followed...but I also adhere to the concepts that healthy saturated fat is GOOD!  So, lots of ribeye, pork chops, cheese, butter & cheese cake (no crust) and vegetable (cooked in butter) AND fermented foods (kimchee, live yogurt).  Oh yeah, even though I was thin, I had a bit of a spare tire, despite lots of good exercise - that's gone too. And, I exercise less now than before.    If you truly are interested in eating nutritionally healthy for our species (ie your health) and actually want to learn something beyond your belief system then this book is only one of several \\"must read\\" but it is one of the most important ones because it uncovers the truly destructive nature of one of our most hallowed foods.  This is NO FAD - there are those of us who have spent our personal and professional lives in scientific & clinical research/study to discover that which can stop, reverse and prevent the riduculous \\"diseases\\" of modern civilization - the answers are right here, right now. Dr. Davis' work is an important part of that scientific/clincal research coming to light - ignore it at the risk of your own health.  VIVE VIDA!

B005ELZKWS|4.0|I never understood the praise that Chickenfoots first album got. With the exception of a few songs (Down the Drain is just a great tune) most of the songs were about as original as dirt. I mean \\"Oh Yeah!\\" is about as poorly written a song as you could get. I probably gave that disc a total of 7 to 8 spins and never went back to it. I wanted to like it but just could not. I think you can tell that these guys got together and took about a two days to write these things.   So when it was announced that III was on the way I did not get all that excited. Then I heard Bigfoot. Pretty great riff in a pretty good song. But still one song does not an album make...... or break for that matter. I then heard bits of other tunes and thought that the album had a chance to at least be better then the first. Of course that's not saying much but it was a start.  I got the album on release day and gave it a spin. Pretty good. Better then the first to say for sure. I then gave it another listen. I thought 'Yeah I like this album. It's got some good and some skippers but it's good overall\\" Then I gave it a third spin and fell in love.  What a great album. It is full a great grooves, catchy choruses, great guitar solos and Michael Anthony's backing vocals (oh those wonderful volcals. This is by far Sammy and Michaels best work together since OU812 and by far Joe's most fun album.  1. Last Temtation - this is one of those tunes that takes a bit but once it hooks you it sticks. Great chorus and a great tune to start off the album - Much better then \\"Avenida Revolution\\" from the first album.  2. Alright - First listen I thought this was going to be the albums \\"oh Yeah\\" tune with a repetative silly dated chorus. Well it's not. It's a fun song not to be taken to seriously. Mike's backing vocals help lift this song to a higher plain then just some ol regular throw away track. Great tune.  3. Different Devil - Probably my least fav track but it's not bad. Just not up to the standards of the rest of the tunes. It's a slower song and Mike's backing vocals are great. It sounds the most like some of Sammy's solo stuff.  4. Up Next - This was another track that i did not love at first but now i find it to be one of the albums best tracks. Such a great bridge with Michaels vocals and a great grove by Satch. Good stuff here.  5. Lighten Up -  I really thought this would be my least fav song but I actually enjoy it now after repeat listens. I thought the chorus was dull but each chorus builds a little more and makes this song a keeper.  6. Come Closer - This might be my fav song and I never pick slow songs. I usually skip them. But this is a great GREAT tune. Sammy's vocals, Micheals harmonies in the bridge, Satch's guitar plaing in the chorus all make foer an all time classic. Great tune. I love it!  7. Three And A Half Letters - Right off the bat this tune opens with Athony's great harmonies so thats a plus. Sammy just talks the verses but belts out the chorus and helps this song stand out. Not a great tune but not a skipper.  8. Bigfoot - Great grove - Nuff said  9. Dubal Blues - Another great tune that I did not care for on first spin but love now. This is a Great tune. Again Michaels backing vocals bring this song to another level. Great riffs and solos in this tune also. love it!!  10. Something Gone Wrong - A slower tune to end the album. It's good but does not stand out. It's the only tune I can't remember at any given time.  11. untitled track - This is really how to end an album. A great song and probably the heaviest on the album.   Now with all the praise I gave this album you may say, \\"Why only 4 stars\\" well I like to wait and give 5 stars to all time classic albums. albums that have stayed great through the years. This album has a chance. Get back to me in 10 years.
0375842209|5.0|The book got here early and was in great condition. I experienced no difficulties with the purchase. It is a great book to read as well.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|THis film you can tell *spoiler alert* is not real but it's awesome the way they made haha to seem as if it is real. This reminded me of the blair witch project only better. The troll hunter guy was so cool after he lightened up. Totally recommend and 5 stars.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|This is an excellent period correct film. Its not like today's 21st century CG movies, rather true and involving and the engine sounds are worth the purchase. If you are a true gear-head, then this film MUST be in your library!
B00319KS7C|4.0|I thought it was funny in the way that you smile a little when something is funny but i did not laugh at all. THis movie was more of a suspense or acftion movie than a comedy. It was ok but kinda weird and the ending could have been better. I would give it 3 or less stars but i gave it 4 stars because i was entertained!
0790742780|5.0|This movie is pretty old, but still applies to today. It is kick-ass! everyone needs to stand up and do this, bring America back to the great country it was. I don't blame this guy for going off one bit!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Come on now, I downloaded this on the first day it came up and there hasn't been a single update addressing these problems. FIX THIS. You guys are better developers then this.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I really liked this movie. The girls are beautiful, I love the dancing, and the acting is spot on. its turns out real strange. Shows you how delicate the mind can be. Wonderful!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This is truly an incredible album, start to finish! Every single song is extremely dance-able, well written, and just plain fun! These are certainly the songs that you want to hear at the party or at the dance!
B0049OSQ18|4.0|Wonderful production. Kinda' like Pete Seeger on a bad, grouchy day -- but his \\"bad day\\" is our good fortune! This is a great album. Interesting instrumentation, good singing and harmony. Neo-Folk? maybe! but not tied down to the mundane oh-hum particulars of traditional folk. This music sounds like the old folk music but it's free -- it still has the steel edge of protest but with the loopy vision of an evangelical anarchist.
B002NPY7E0|4.0|This is one of the best unsung movies to come out of Hollywood. Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro at their best. Got a little scare when the DVD stalled and we had to restart it, but it worked the second time.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|This was excellent. It was unfortunately predictable as most movies are, but well worth watching and worthy of buying. It would have been nice to know how Hannah got from the facility in Arizona, USA, to Morocco, Africa.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Prepare for the best thrill ride. Hop on and strap into this marvelous book. The suspense takes you on a ride that you just want to continuously get back on. once you read the first you gotta read them all.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This is a great movie, with a tightly woven plot. Also, Disney did a great job with the 3d filming. There was no problems with blurring as I have seen with some movies where the 3d part was kludged into it as an afterthought.
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is the most beautiful and wondrous book that I have read in a very long time. The evocative descriptions of this elegant, enchanting circus draw the reader into its dreamlike world, while the temporal convergence of two chronologically distinct threads of the plot builds emotional urgency. The use of the present tense throughout keeps the reader firmly anchored in the characters' perspectives. One of those rare books that I couldn't put down while also wanting to savor my enjoyment of the writing.
B004ZNACA6|2.0|I've never been a huge Pink Floyd fan - I owned only Dark Side of the Moon on LP, but their music was everywhere, at least the hits on classic rock radio.  Feeling like I was missing something, and because I really liked solo Syd Barrett, I splurged for the Oh By The Way set when it came out a few years ago.  As I plowed through that set I realized I'd missed the boat on Pipers and Meddle, two unqualifiedly great records, and I liked songs I hadn't heard before on other albums up to and including The Wall, another \\"okay double album that would have been a great single album.\\"  I was somewhat disappointed by the sound on OBTW, except for Pipers and Dark Side, which were recent remasters. Other bands' catalogues had been reissued with proper, sometimes spectacular, sonic improvements over earlier CD versions.  However I've now had the opportunity to compare OBTW to the Discovery Box (via MP3s), and I'm surprised to report that overall I greatly prefer the OBTW remasterings.  My general impression is that the Discovery set has been remastered a bit louder and with the bottom end boosted, and more often than not this isn't beneficial to the music.  There's a clarity and balance to the OBTW versions that's sometimes lost in 2011.  I can't say if it's compression, but the Discovery set doesn't sound like it's meant to be listened to on a good stereo or through good headphones, my preference.  Pipers and Dark Side sound pretty terrific in 2011, but the 2006 or 2007 reissues sounded great as well.  Saucerful of Secrets, never a great sounding LP, may have been improved in the new set, but just.  2009 Beatles remasters this set ain't.  The OBTW packaging is great, and I'm glad I don't have reason to ditch the set.  The Discovery set is a missed opportunity.
B003L77G10|5.0|If you're a fan of Julianne and/or The Good Wife, you'll love watching the weekly story unfold along with the personal drama among the regulars.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|How are they allowed to sell a movie along with a digital copy still (October) when apparently the digital copy offer expired in the middle of september. I bought this version of the movie solely for the digital copy, when I could have saved money. I've never been less pleased with Amazon.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|my only complaint on droid x is the UI. needs some polish. its cool looking just a bit clustered. took a min to underatand the weather wheel.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Awesome CD. Although it is second-handed, its quality is so good as a new one. Price is low. I like it.
B000QRIGJY|3.0|I knew something was off in the first few chapters and even mentioned it to my wife. I was just choosing the next Bosch in order and would have done the same thing again even knowing this was an expanded serial. But it is not a full-blown novel and the story leaps where it usually twists. A little too quick a read, this one should have had a little more of a discount from full fledged Connelly novel price tag. Bosch fans need to hear the story, but don't expect to spend as much time reading as the other offerings in the series.
0061997811|5.0|This book is a MUST have for anyone calling themselves a Harry Potter fa. It not only has interviews with a lot of the cast but it takes you through step by step on how each movie was made, start to finish with a lot of little extras such as The Marauders Map and Quidditch World Cup tickets. LOVED IT!
0307946711|5.0|Nick Hornby was right--this book is \\"fantastically readable.\\" I'm a literature snob and I have encountered few books as instantly captivating as this one. Sure, Emma and Dexter aren't extremely likable characters, but that's precisely their charm: they are profoundly HUMAN characters. Nicholls's portrayal of these two people is completely unsentimental, which is one of my favorite things about his writing. He is utterly truthful and always a shade sarcastic, and you get the impression that the author himself doesn't suffer fools. I was weeping for the last 50-60 pages (it's my own fault for reading it while pregnant), and my husband kept teasing me by asking me if the plot had taken this or that shmaltzy turn, which it never had. I felt completely un-manipulated while reading this story, which is something rare when reading love stories (although I wouldn't reduce this story to falling under that particular category). I have little patience with popular fiction that seeks to tweak my heartstrings. I always maintain that writers should simply tell the story, and if they tell it with enough style and honesty, my heartstrings will be duly tweaked. This book is one of the funniest I've ever read, and also one of the saddest, and it helped that I kept picturing Emma as the divine Anne Hathaway and Dex as the lovely, lovely Jim Sturgess. (I haven't seen the movie, but I love both of those actors.) Full disclosure: I also happen to be a lot like Emma--a rather politically-charged, artsy-fartsy feminist, so I was especially drawn to her character. I could go on and on, but I won't. It's just a clever, \\"fantastically readable\\" book and I'm looking forward to reading David Nicholls's other work.
B0051MKMNC|2.0|Every year I buy about 10 movies I've never seen and generally enjoy about 90% of them.  This year my miss is LIMITLESS.    While I really enjoyed the premise and thought the entire plot was well thought out this one missed me for in the execution.  It's like the creative team felt they need to push the envelope in cinematic technique.  I think the movie could have stood on it's own without that.  THe acting is solid (though you can tell its as filmed quickly in some scenes).  This movie could have been great and could have been a repeat watch in my household.    Sad to say that I cannot recommend purchasing this movie.  While I am certain that some people love it- don't purchase just because you've seen the previews and like the premise.
0807014273|5.0|In his Foreword to MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING, Rabbi Harold Kushner writes: \\"If a book has one passage, one idea with the power to change a personal life that alone justifies reading it.\\" I read this book in 1961, reread in 1991 and I have just finished reading it again to get a better understanding of it.  At the age of 85, I am searching for the meaning for my actual survival of five Nazi camps. I bore witness how people were capable to brave the worst conceivable conditions. I do not recall many nihilists among us prisoners, predominantly pious Jews; our omnipresent suffering had meaning. For most of us, zest for life and trust in God didn't diminish. We were daydreamers of pleasant happenings in the past and wishful happenings in the future. Frankl believes that neither pleasure nor power, but the quest for meaning in life is essential. He quotes  Nietzsche's maxim \\"He who has a WHY to live, can bear with almost any HOW.\\"<br /><br /> I shared my life story, mainly my predicament during the Holocaust, with over 700 audiences. I deem it to be my mission; it gives a meaning to my suffering. While my story is primarily about suffering and losses, Victor Frankl's first part of the book is primarily about his strength and will to survive. I have often been asked:\\"What kept you going? Why did you strive to stay alive? How could you survive when so many others haven't?\\"  I have no clear cut answer; it might have been a combination of factors and luck was perhaps one of them. I do know that despite the suffering I strove to survive. The desire and hope to be reunited with my family gave me the courage to suffer.<br /><br />Frankl, an accomplished psychiatrist before the war, seems to have psychiatric mediums. His therapeutic doctrine known as logotherapy (Logo\\" from the Greek denotes, \\"meaning,\\" and therapy is helping people with their neuroses) implies that it is imperative to find meaning for life. He believed that people cannot avoid suffering but they can choose how to cope with it and to find meaning in it. Hope should never be given up; Frankl quotes Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) \\"Life is like being at the dentist. You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.\\" Frankl survived Auschwitz, and three other concentration camps; this was a miracle and a blessing to us. In this book written six months after liberation Frankl writes: \\"The condemned man, immediately before his execution, gets the illusion that he might be reprieved at the very last minute. We, too, clung to shred of hope (p.10).\\"<br /><br />During the Holocaust, I had been subjected to unimaginable acts of extreme wickedness, as reflected in my autobiography From a Name to A Number. I thought that I have seen it all, apparently not. Frankl's book brings to light horrific situations that I have not heard of or read about. His story contributes to the grand, but incomplete, mosaic of Holocaust history. There are still stories to be told, to be written. Once we Holocaust survivors are no longer among the living, our stories, the importance of their intrinsic lessons, should be read and reread. Man's Search for Meaning is a contribution of monumental proportions to the Holocaust legacy. I am grateful to Frankl for enlightening me and others, who have read the 12 million copies, in twenty-four languages, of this book.<br /><br />Frankl had an option, in 1942, to emigrate to the U.S. and thus save his and his wife's life. He had chosen to let his visa lapse, because he didn't want to leave his aging parents in Austria. Consequently, his parents and his wife perished in the Holocaust while incarcerated Viktor Frankl suffered. He found meaning in his suffering. Abiding by the fifth Commandment Honor your Father and Mother was meaningful to Frankl.

0470424656|5.0|This book was a recommended reading for a course at Yale. It's a great book for practitioners and students. Each chapter is broken down into sizable bites of information which take you step by step how to think through valuation. Equations are easy to follow, and typically each chapter ends with tips/reminders on how to accurately use the methods just taught.

B004P8JPS6|1.0|What happened here?  I've been a Reacher fan from the first book but THE AFFAIR was truely a bad story, with an unbelievable plot and a ridiculous ending.  Did someone else write the second half of this book?  Lee Child is better then this.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|Megatron was going after the Cube on earth AND meeting up with Spock (aka Sentinel) for making the ultimate bad-ass portal?  How many other things will they tack on to that moment in history?  Transformers 4 anyone?  The Soviets took pictures in 1963 of the Pillars drag marks and stockpiled on the moon.  Who were these Decepticons that did this and why didn't they attack Earth for resources if they had nothing else to do?  Soviets never bothered to tell anyone about those early pictures they took?  Sure would have been helpful to the Autobots years ago huh?  Another story spoiler the writers couldn't afford.  Sam's hot model girlfriend (who cares what her name is) has her opening scene showing a close-up of her perfect a_ss in panties.  Can we get back to the robots now and schedule her p_orn movie later?  -And let me know the title for that movie  Poor Sam having it tough getting a job....that storyline took too long and got annoying fast.  Sam just happens to get a job where one of the few human worshiper-spies for the Decepticons works?  That sure was convenient.  And what was up with that psycho Asian guy's attitude?  Were they desperate for the underwear-disgusting, gay-like comedy?  The Autobots revive Sentinel and speak to him in English when they try to calm him down.  I sure hope he had been to earth in the past otherwise I can understand why he's so freaked out by the Autobots' voices.  Sam's parents camp out near Sam's hot model girlfriend's house and give him woman advice....creepy.  Sam tells his mom that his hot model girl is \\"the one\\".  Really?  If Mikaela dumped him after two big adventures and years together....how long can he last with a hot model who doesn't like him risking his life?  Just after Sentinel reveals he's really with the Decepticons and all h_ell breaks loose and Ironhide is killed, Sam goes back to visit his folks to have the girlfriend chat to change the pace of the movie??  I'm not sure which is worse:  McDreamy as the traitorous bad guy, or Spock doing Sentinel's voice.  The Autobots' ship is destroyed in true shuttle-Challenger-explosion fashion....double creepy.  Sam can't shoot McDreamy from 10 feet away before getting b_itch-slapped?  Of course not, we need McDreamy to turn the Pillar back on again later in the movie...and how did McDreamy know what to push?  Sam basically ruins the Autobots desperately needed surprise attack with his bungled rescue of the hot model.  Nothing like risking the fate of the world on a guy who's jealous-hot for a potential porn star and can't shoot a gun.  They spent a lot of movie time with human strike teams trying to get close to the Trump building but never did...Optimus shot at it via Shockwave's gun.  They could have made a mini-movie of the tipped-building scenes....and I have to say that was the toughest building to destroy I've ever seen.  The humans did \\"deceptively\\" well battling Decepticons with assault rifles.  Remember how Vortex (the Decepticon helicoptor) obliterated the military base in the first Transformers?  Spock gives his Vulcan line for \\"The needs of the many outweigh....\\" - that was my first clue that the film hit rock bottom.  There's already enough homage to Star Trek in this movie - don't mess with Star Trek II.  I'm sure Spock's plan to enslave us little fragile humans to work on the huge Cybertron metal planet will work just fine......was I the only one skeptical about this the moment he said it?  I'm also sure that bringing Cybertron into close proximity would have NO effect on the Earth.  Hot model girl saves the world by using her feminine wiles on Megatron??  That was my second clue that the film hit rock bottom.  Megatron can see Spock about to destroy Optimus, so he doesn't wait a few seconds first before shooting Spock?  And then Optimus takes the opportunity to kill Megatron.....see Megaton, that's what you get.  I was very happy that Optimus wasted no time killing Megatron and Spock....unlike Sam who when handed a pistolfrom Epps, grabs it like a little girl grabbing an icky worm with her fingers.  The film apparently had very obvious product placements, but I was too busy trying to find reasons to like the movie to notice.  What's the best parts?  1. Opening scene on Cybertron.  2. Whenever Optimus is fighting.  3. Any scenes of the hot model in panties or sexy outfits.  And to think, when she was a kid her classmates made fun of her big lips and no b_oobs....where are those loser classmates now?  (It should be noted - the \\"Transporter\\" dude is bangin her now and he's 20 years older than her.  Now that's a REAL hero.)

0062060554|4.0|Ah ha!  An English author takes on a mystery.  That's a lot to take on, with good English mystery writers from the past asking if the present stock has a good 'nough offering.  Although the book dragged in the middle because of repetition it was a very good read.  There were a few places where I had to go back and mutter \\"say what?\\"  I figured part of it out but I still had a surprise waiting on me at the end.  It ended a little too smoothly, too fast, but after all forgiveness and understanding come quickly on the throes of true, lasting love. Congratulations to the author for a very successful first book!  I highly recommend it, and I love to see first-time authors get a boost.   The book was a gift.

Aperture allows you to have some of the fixes of the harder Adobe photo shop type programs, in a much easier format. I highly recommend this book if you have Aperture, or are thinking about switching from I-photo to Aperture.  Aperture is very good for organizing your photo's and camera vidoes.

B004MERJOK|5.0|\\"Lone Survivor\\" is a Navy Seal's personal story of being in hand-to-hand combat high in the mountains on the Afghan-Pakistan border.  His commanding officer and two fighting comrades are killed in a running battle, and he alone survives.  Severely wounded by multiple hits, Marcus (the Lone Survivor), falls, fights, and struggles his way down the steep mountainside to land in an Afghan village.  He is sheltered (according to Pashtun custom) and finally rescued by his comrades. This is a truly gripping story that describes what it is to become a SEAL and why so many of them have a \\"NO MERCY\\" policy.  And his story makes you thankful that such men are on the front line protecting us once more.

I can relate to alot of her feelings and emotions but WOW this girl has been through alot and she is very strong whether she knows it or not! Just when you think you've had it rough, read this, I assure you the things this women endured and her strength through it all will keep you moving. Gbless this women and her family and I'm sure things happen for a reason, which we may not know until the end.
0743454537|3.0|I'd hate to ever be in the situation of this book.  How far would you go to save your loved one?  I found it interesting how the author starts of leading your heart to breaking point for Anna and you start feeling strong dislike for parents who brought her in to the world as nothing but an spare part to be harvested for her sister.  It then it switched to the view of another and another and with each view of another family member and more background you get swayed back and forth.  It's not as simple as that.   I was gripped by it to the point I struggled to put it down because I wanted to find out what happens next.  Unfortunately the ending ruined it for me. Why not just leave it open? Why lead us all the way to that point only to go to the lamest ending the book could have had.  I'm really torn in what rating to give it.  Had it not been for the ending it would have been 5 but the ending makes me want to give it a 1.  So I guess I'll settle for 3 because it was a good read until the end...
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Very different to Demi's previous 2 albums. In my opinion most of the songs on this album have a bit of a Techno feel as opposed to her traditional Pop and Rock songs.  This being said, Unbroken is her best album to date, its fun but with soulful messages, if you are a true Lovato fan you will love it however if you are a huge fan of her Disney stuff, you might be less inclined to listen.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" (1967) sounds revitalized in its 2009 stereo remaster. However, the original mono mix has more punch, with notable differences on \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and the reprise of the title song. The stereo and mono mixes should be issued on a single disc in the same fashion as the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966). Nearly 45 years later, \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" remains among the landmark recordings of the 20th century.
B001IBV694|5.0|Anyone who thinks Stanley Kubrick's film version of this is any good should definitely read the book, because it is much better. Many people talk about how hard the slang is to understand but I first read this when I was about 16 and I had no trouble at all. Being from a small town in the U.S. with no real exposure to Slavic languages it only took me reading the first chapter to get used to the slang. So don't let the language discourage you from enjoying this masterpiece of literature. It is a bit graphic and quite violent but (unlike the movie) there is a purpose to it all.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I have both PS3 Slim and XBox 360 Slim, and decided to take my PS3 on an out of town business trip. The TV in the hotel is old with no HDMI input. It was perfect time to try the G155.  First both PS3 Slim and XBox 360 Slim fit very well. The hard case is simple but handsome looking. The latches are good enough that I wouldn't feel nervous about it snap open. Tried to sit on the flat side and realize it won't hold my weight (185lb)!  At the airport I still had to take out the machine during screening, which is unavoidable but easily done.  The case fit as a carry on bag. I have a laptop bag and a carry-on luggage and didn't want to check one in. This time I put my laptop and bag in my luggage as it was squash-able. For long flight where I'll need my laptop, I would have to check in the luggage.  The two long round pouches inside the case can hold couple of controllers in addition to the AC adapter for the screen and power cord for PS3. My XBox Slim has a big transformer so that will reduce room further. I have the PS3 wireless headset and that won't fit in the case (bummer). 7.1 wireless virtual surround gaming on the road and fit in one case would be fabulous, but fully understand room limit. I simply allocate more room in the luggage.  The screen feels bigger than the 15.5\\" spec. It's bright, sharp and beautiful. I tried racing and few action games that had very fast movement at 720p and the screen showed no lag. The viewing angle is limited. Horizontally it's good enough for two kids sitting side by side comfortably. However, the up and down angles are more restrictive for games with dark scenes (e.g., Socom 4, COD Black Ops and Heavy Rain). Since the case opens and angle is fixed on flat surface like a desk or table, the player must adjust the height if sitting on a chair. With most people's height, sitting on the floor to play should be fine. I like to play late at night in bed. The angle of the open case is greater as the surface is not hard, coupled with the user sinking in the bed, made viewing screen difficult for folks with normal height (below 6 feet from my estimation).  The speakers are OK. They are not \\"bright\\" speaker types if you know what I mean. Not great but not bad either. I haven't tried playing music (since I use iPod for that), but am impressed with the voice coming through. It's clear and deep.  All in all, this is an innovative product and probably the best solution for the road warriors to date. Few things the user will need to adjust but it's remarkable to be able to take a PS3 on the road with a beautiful and bright screen. If I'm to take it on a long road trip, I'll certain consider a portable generator or battery with a 600 watt inverter!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie vividly captures the feeling of being depaysee (out of one's familiar surroundings). The main characters are both lost in Japan, unmoored and lonely, tired, unable to sleep, jet-lagged and confused. Coppola captures this ethos perfectly. The setting is magnificent- a luxurious but cold hotel in Tokyo and the lights/sounds/swirling/frenetic activity in the streets below. Bill Murray nails the jaded Bob and his midlife crisis perfectly. Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is just realizing that her marriage is not all she expected it to be and that no marriage can provide her with the life direction she is seeking. Charlotte and Bob are both intelligent and highly attuned to the nonsense (e.g. Charlotte's husband's self-absorption, the inanity spewed by the actress Kelly, the artiness of the crew directing the commercial) that surrounds them. High above the Tokyo streets, both protagonists are trapped in their luxurious but cold setting and the two forge an ambiguous, tender bond. It is to Coppola's credit that the bond remains ambiguous to the end (what did they say to one another in the final scene?) and that the movie avoids the traps that could so easily have ensued had the two had allowed the obvious attraction between them to become explicitly sexual. Coppola allows Bob and Charlotte's story to unfold in its own messy,goofy, unclassifiable way. The scenes involving the filming of the whiskey commercial are hysterical. The scene where Murray sings \\"More than this\\" at the Karaoke bar perfectly captures the film's spirit: unpolished, ambiguous, heartfelt and ironic.
1423140591|5.0|Zo my goodness this is a great book!  Its a great addition to the Percy Jackson books and a good sequel to The Lost Hero.  The only thing that I was dissapointed in was that it was a little shorter then the Lost Hero but that is understandable since in The Lost Hero the story and the purpose of the series was laid down and in this one we already knew what was going on so the only thing to do was introduce the 2 other Demigods from the 7 (Frank, and Hazel) and of course show what Percy is up to. Overall the book is good not the best of all the Percy Jackson books but definetly a good one.<br /><br />Some people trash Riordan's humor in these books saying that its cheesy and not original but I think they are wrong.  I like how some of the jokes are cheesy thats what makes it funny and he is definately creative when it comes to most of the humor he puts in.  I'm not saying he is the funniest guy around but some of his humor that he puts in makes me laugh and it keeps the books up beat so they dont become dark and depressing which the last 2 books (Lost Hero, Son of Neptune) have potential of being a little dark without the humor.<br /><br />In conclusion Great book buy it!
B002VKB0M4|4.0|I love French cinema and Paris - but did not have high hopes for this film.  I rented it because I was missing Paris and could tell that the film would have great shots of Paris- and it did.    I have never cared for Binoche.  I found the beginning of the film to be hackneyed and trite.  The character of the professor was off-putting and a bit creepy.  Nevertheless- by the end of the film, I was won over and I think the film is good but not great.  One of my favorite activities (shared by many visitors to Paris) in Paris is watching the life swirl around me on the streets and in the surrounding houses.  This film captures this experience.  We are brought into the interlocking worlds of a number of characters whose lives intersect in ways they do and do not perceive.  Although there are some truly clunky aspects (the affair between student and prof was not credible, the young man's illness seemed to be conveyed in an unconvincing manner, the last-minute intersection of the professor and the dying man, the motorcycle accident, the fashionistas in the warehouse) of this conceit in the film, the melange is ultimately messy, unresolved, and poignant.  One is left with a true appreciation for the people whose lives touch our own.  Some of the best scenes:  the small-minded owner of a boulangerie  the party scene (what great dancing)  the father-to-be  the cruelty of the young student  the tenderness between the fruit seller and Elise  Elise and her children  The last scene- where the dying man looks upon his nieces and nephew, says good bye to this sister, and takes a cab to the hosptial- was just like the film iself- hackneyed, trite,and clunky in places ---but ultimately true-to-life, messy, unresolved, poignant and somewhat magical.
0767903862|4.0|I have just discovered Bill Bryson - my first read was \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" which I loved and since then have read his earlier book about a road trip in USA (can't remember the name ...) and am listening to his most recent \\"At Home\\" on audiobook.  I always enjoy his turn of phrase, descriptions and the way he can spin a yarn from a mixture of facts, experiences, imagination and humour. I love the way he makes history interesting and brings it alive. In this book about travels in Australia, which is a decade or so old now, he is mellowed a little and in high spirits, playful and energetically inquisitive and full of enthusiasm for a variety of \\"tourist attractions\\" from the ancient and natural to the cheap and tacky to the historical and hysterical. He notices and finds joy in little details (gas pumps in full sunshine) and grand vistas (Uluru) alike. Even when the actual places he finds on his travels are not scintillating, what he makes of them often had me rolling about laughing out loud.  - I thoroughly recommend this book!
B004WDRSO2|5.0|First off I must admit that I do not have a blu-ray player so I can only watch the dvd version. That said, I enjoy the dvd but I will say to those who are a little behind the times such as myself that all but one of the extras are exclusively on the blu-ray, not on the dvd, but that doesn't bother me much, I buy dvd's for the movies, not the extras and I am sure that someday in the future I'll be able to watch the blu-ray anyway. That said there is one complaint that I have, the case says that the blu-ray had DTS surround on it but the dvd doesn't, that is a disappointment because I would love to be able to listen to it with DTS, especially since they should have plenty of space on the dvd from the lack of extras to fit it on there. That said I'm sure from the other reviews that the blu-ray looks even better than the dvd version and obviously sounds better with the DTS and would recommend that anyone who likes the Lion King rather they have a blu-ray player or not to go ahead and purchase this, it's worth spending the extra 5 bucks just to have this movie, and never know, someday you may buy a blu-ray player and be thankful that you bought this movie on blu-ray as well.

B0055S348W|4.0|I've used it several times with success to print documents and photos from my LG Ally. However, for some reason it does not always recognize my hp printer,via wifi, even when I'm standing next to the printer and using the wifi system in my home. That is frustrating since it does, on other occasions, connect with this same printer.

B003L77G6A|5.0|From reading some of the negative reviews, I was really worried that this season would be a bomb. Quite the opposite.  I think Amy Farrah Fowler is a great character and adds to the meta-fiction element of putting 1990s sitcom stars in the show. The idea that she would want to blend in socially is not inconsistent with her character - she studies neuroscience and is interested in human psychology, unlike Sheldon. Also, she's pretty darn cute.   The fact that the characters are settling down into 'normal' relationships, or at least trying to, seems to fit in with the overall story arc. The whole series began with the Johnny Galecki character choosing to become more social, and since then he has slowly been shedding his man-child persona. Howard has also grown into a more mature, likeable character, again going with the whole theme of the series.  I think you get the feeling with the show that they've assembled a \\"dream team\\" of comic actors. You can tell that the actors genuinely enjoy working with each other and on the show.   My only minor complaint was that some of the riffs on Raj maybe went a bit too far. I don't want to be PC or anything, but I think the old guideline of laughing with someone vs. laughing at someone applies here. Still, it's not really a deal-breaker at all.  The only other (slight) complaint was that maybe Kaley Cuoco didn't get enough air time.  As far as the science / nerd cred, there's still a lot of it, including cameos of some famous scientists and, especially cool, Woz himself. I think we need to remember that this is still just prime time TV, it's supposed to be light entertainment. After all, you wouldn't expect Frasier to give a lecture on atonalism or quote Deleuze and Guattari, or for an episode of Sons of Anarchy to be a detailed exposition on how to rebuild a motorcycle engine.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This Jack Reacher takes you back to the days when he was still enlisted and alludes to some set up for The Killing Floor.

B00386EZJU|5.0|This is one of the best movies out there!  Good story, plenty of action, great music - this is a movie you can watch with the kids, but it's not too \\"kiddie\\" for the older viewer.  You fall in love with the dragon and the hero, and the ancient dilemma of differences and expectations between parent and child is worked out with courage on both sides.  Can't wait for the next movie!
B004289ZW0|1.0|I have used this item for 6 months with an iPad aviation chart app.  Initially, the touch on/off function worked ok.  It was a bit erratic, but it was usable.  Finally, after 6 months the device totally failed.  GPS performance, when it was working, was unreliable: The unit would freeze and required a hard reset... not exactly what you need when flying.  I have since purchased the Dual Electronics XGPS150.  It is a MUCH better product.  Do not waste your money and time on the GNS 5870.
B003L1ZXCU|4.0|The writing style of this book threw me off a little at first. It's almost like in some instances there are too many details, and in other there aren't enough. For example in some places he uses these long winded back stories or over the top descriptions filled with too many adjectives to introduce you to new characters, and then others he simply mentions their name once and expects you to remember who they are 3 chapters later.  That being said this was still a very good book. It took a little while to get going, and I was a little worried at first, but it really sucked me in in the second half. But then it just ends on a total cliff hanger with almost no resolution. Lucky for me I read this book now, after the sequel/conclusion has been published, because if I had to wait two years for the conclusion I would have been a little upset.  All in all this is a good read and I'm anxiously awaiting the delivery of \\"Freedom (TM)\\" so I can see how it all wraps up.  Dan
1557420580|5.0|I absolutely love Fitzgerald. And this books written about the Jazz Age are my favorites of his. The characters are complex and the story is intriguing. I couldn't put it down. What makes a book stand out for me is whether or not it made me think, and this book definitely did. I recommend this 100% for any fan of The Great Gatsby or other Fitzgerald novels or short stories.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The action is top notch, moving rapidly and coherently to an exciting climax.  It is hard to understand how you wind up rooting for thieves, but it comes out quite naturally.  It's just good to see everyone get what they deserve.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|We were fooled by a cleverly edited preview that this would be a fresh post-mod take on Thor as an ancient hero trapped in a modern world. It wasn't. The preview selected almost entirely from about 20 minutes worth of the movie -- the part that features Natalie Portman -- and none of the rest, which is a stupid, badly done comic book fantasy story with cheesy special effects. I like well-done superhero movies. Ironman I was terrific. But this sucks hard. The longest 1 hour and 55 minutes I have spent in a long time. Don't Do It!
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is another childhood movie that I sent to my daughter in college.  She loved it growing up and she still loves it.  Movie night included this movie and another of her favorite childhood movies.  It was viewed by several of her fellow students (male & female) in her dorm and they ALL loved it!
B005MMYCY6|1.0|You kinda get what the director was going for here -- trying to do a reverse role model story with a badass rocker dude as the role model who ultimately redeems himself despite his anti-everything behavior. Did not work at all. I rented this because of the interesting cast and some reviewer called it \\"hilarious.\\" That reviewer was clearly under the influence of serious narcotics, because there was exactly one laugh in the entire film. And the cast is utterly wasted. Rainn Wilson spends most of the movie in a catatonic state, Natalie Portman is mousey (if you can believe that) and Joseph Gordon Leavitt is doing his best Jesus Christ impersonation, but without the winning charm. Avoid this one too. Nothing redeeming about it.

0071762345|5.0|Over the last decade, I've developed hundreds of websites, marketed them for Google, and have helped make my clients millions of dollars.  Likeable Social Media is hands-down one of best marketing books I have read in a very long time.  There's no fluff. No filler.  Simply terrific advice on how to make the most of social networking in order to improve your business.<br /><br />The best part about this book is that it's absolutely stuffed with case study after case study of how businesses have triumphed (and suffered) by harnessing or ignoring the power of engaging people through social networks.<br /><br />While many books on marketing simply offer up theory, the author has noticeably poured a significant amount of time into researching real examples of how social networks can make or break a business.  You're treated to concrete examples of what works, and what doesn't.  Granted a few case studies are from the author's major corporate clients, but the information he provides is still extremely useful.<br /><br />With the conclusion of each chapter, you are offered a quick recap of \\"action items\\" that make it easy for you to plan your marketing efforts.<br /><br />I'm no stranger to marketing through social networks, but the author has definitely given me great new ideas.  A few involve how to encourage more people to become fans of a business page, I'm a little ashamed I hadn't thought of them sooner.<br /><br />What's interesting is that the author doesn't simply help you to positively engage existing fans, but how to deal with unhappy customers.  While some of the info is Customer Service 101, he offers a fresh take on how a bad situation can be spun into great free promotion.<br /><br />Not every technique outlined in the book is brand-new.  But many ideas haven't been addressed in other books on social network marketing, which makes this book worth its weight in gold.  Take my advice as a longtime internet marketer: add this book to your cart right now if you want to engage potential customers and improve your business.ness.

0385738765|5.0|4.5 stars  James Dashner's writing just gets better and better. The Maze Runner was good but I wasn't sold on it...but this latest installment has made me a complete fangirl of this series. The stark writing is perfect to tell this grim (yet hopeful), mind-bending tale. There's this stirring sense of these characters struggling to hold on to their humanity in the midst of all these trials and confusion that has me invested in their fate. As these characters persevere and fight and SURVIVE with their hope intact and pushing them forward, I can't help but cheer and then hold my breath for them...because Dashner is a master at creating that exhilarating feeling where you really, truly NEVER know what's going to happen next.  I love the Lost-esque feel to everything. And I do not evoke the Lost word lightly.  What an electrifying series! I can't wait to see what crazy twists James Dashner has in store in The Death Cure.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Cast Away is a good movie. I'm scared to go in an airplanes for the fact that it can crash. And you never know where the airplane will crash. Specially if it crashes in the water. I don't know how to swim. But either way this movie was interesting on all the way's he came up with to stay alive for four years.  But once he was found and went back home it is real sad that his long time girl friend, Kelly, was now married and they had a child. Kelly is the one thing that kept him alive for four years. Now that he is back you can see in Kelly eyes that she wishes she could leave her husband for her true love. But it wasn't going to happen. In the end it seemed he was going to find love in another woman.
B0043KK4N6|3.0|After watching the movie, I wanted to hear the music again and again, so I purchased the soundtrack.  It's just ok.  Maybe it was just better when I watched the movie along with the performances.  Soundtrack was just so so.
015603008X|5.0|Daniel Keyes weaves a touching and poignant tale of the human condition around the life of a boy who is mentally disabled and offered a second chance. Keyes tackles a difficult topic with poise, respect and thoughtfulness. The book jacket of this version gives away the plot bookends, to some extent, and yet it's the biographical journey of Charlie Gordon that matters most.  The story quickly becomes fascinating and Charlie's progress is measured through almost flawless pacing. Keyes embraces the full scope of his material and keeps it believable and unpredictable throughout the heart of the novel. Charlie Gordon feels real. Some supporting characters are bland, but they highlighted others that are more memorable: my favorite was Winslow.  This book was physically challenging! I found myself pacing at one point. At various times, my heart raced and pounded. Eyes swelled or wrinkled. Lips smiled, cheered and grimaced. My hands roamed my face looking for something, anything, to scratch. I ran the emotional gamut. And I lost sleep.     As someone opposed to all medical testing/research on other animals, I was unsure what message the book would send on this issue. In fact, the subject is never directly approached. To avoid any spoilers, I'll step off this soapbox by saying that the apathy or indifference displayed here by an author who has all other angles carefully considered is what left me most disappointed.  Flowers from Algernon is a fairly quick read that digs below the surface and leaves a lasting impression; it's a remarkable achievement on so many levels. When Charlie asks \\"Why am I always looking at life through a window?\\" it reminded me of the Dalai Lama's \\"Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll be able to enjoy it a second time\\". I hope it applies to Charlie Gordon, too.
1250004349|5.0|What a gripping story!  Sarah's Key tells about tragic events in WW-2 concerning the Jewish community of which young Sarah and her family are members.  The story tells of their removal from their homes to a concentration camp.  We hear about the atrocities toward the Jews in Germany and Poland but this takes place in Paris, France.  The author tells the story alternating in the main character's voice of the present and Sarah's of 1942's WW-2 voice.  Discover the life altering key Sarah has. It is a must read before seeing the movie.
B00009AOBI|4.0|\\"Mask\\" is one of my favourite movies and this edition was quite a surprise for me as soundtrack by Bob Seger has been removed with music by Springsteen taking its place (which was actually the original soundtrack). To tell you the truth, I preferred Seger, his music gave more rhythm to the whole movie and somehow made the saddest scene a little lighter bringing some hope. \\"Roll me away\\" at the end blew me away!Springsteen in this case is quite depressing. I did appreciate the director's commentary though it wuold have been perfection to have interviews to the actors as well.
0525423281|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is one of my favorite recent contemporary reads so I was eagerly anticipating the companion book's release. Happily, Stephanie Perkins pulled off a great follow up to Anna. Even with a new cast of cast of characters, the feel of the story is just as charming and captivating and left me completely satisfied.<br /><br />Lola is a quirky and flawed yet endearing main character. She's confident and outgoing and likes to have fun with her clothing choices and dress up in wigs and her own fashion creations.  She's 17 and lives in a San Francisco Victorian with her two dads, and has a part time job and a loyal best friend. Her love life is heating up with her rocker boyfriend Max, and things are going pretty well until her old crush Cricket Bell moves back next door and then things start to get complicated.<br /><br />Part of the book's charm is due to the unconventional characters. The main character Lola isn't perfect, and her decisions can be rash and infuriating at times, but I liked that she seemed authentic. The supporting characters are fully detailed and help to enrich the story. I loved Lola's family especially. Her two dads are a great support system for her, and it's great to see her interactions with her involved parents, which is something we don't see too often in YA. As a bonus, it is fun to see some familiar characters from Anna turn up in this book and interesting to see how outsiders view them. The funny thing is that I thought I would miss Anna and St. Clair from the previous book, but as I became involved with this story, I was less interested in their lives and more taken with the current cast. You get the best of both worlds with the overlap of characters past and present.<br /><br />The story is set in the Bay Area and all the details written into the story lend an air of authenticity that as a former San Franciscan I enjoyed a lot. It's not Paris, but San Francisco has its charms as well. This setting is more grounded and relatable in a way.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins again impressed me with the way she writes slow building romance, with the longing looks and sexual tension that leaps off the page. This author is great at capturing the small moments in a relationship and the feel of first love. As the boy next-door, Cricket is smart, sweet and tall, and fashion forward in his own right. Mainly he's a nice, normal guy, which can be a rarity in itself in YA books. The author takes advantage of his close proximity next door by creating cute, special opportunities for them to interact. These characters will make you melt. Fans of the first book should fall in love with this couple just as much as Anna and St. Clair.<br /><br />I wager you will enjoy this book if you like YA contemporary romance, the book Anna and the French Kiss, and books with quirky characters. It's hard to perfectly capture the magic formula that is the first book, but I found Lola and the Boy Next Door a treat to read all the same.erkins again impressed me with the way she writes slow building romance, with the longing looks and sexual tension that leaps off the page.

0061784788|5.0|This could very well be James Rollins' best Sigma Force novel to date.  This outing, more than any other SForce thriller, harkens back to the glory days of Rollins' writing, when he specialized in stand-alone adventure novels set underground, in the jungles of the Amazon, or perhaps up at the North Pole.  The story spins wildly around the United States, and encompasses historical figures from our country's past, the lost tribes of Israel, and the mystery of the Ananszi Indian tribe's disappearance.  There is rarely a dull page, never a dull chapter, and finally some romantic action between two of Rollins' characters who have been making eyes at each other for the last three books.<br /><br />I was reluctant to start this due to the formulaic nature of the last two Sigma Force novels, but was glad once I did start it that I had forced myself to give it a try.<br /><br />Excellent fun!

B0033807C2|1.0|A work of art, if Van Gogh was a writer he would write books half as good as this. Iv'e always liked greek mytholgy, and Iv'e read many a novels in my time and all books by Rick Riordan Iv'e loved, but this is the one I favour the most. The book in its self is masterfuley writen, the story line massively compelling and the actual facts about Greek Mytholgy very accurate. kronos is a masterpiece, as is every other asspect of the book, I liked the god's attitude and aperance. Another thing was the humour in the book marrvously good and well spread out. In short, a awsom book writen by, in my view, a gunius.  This has been the review of a 10 year old,  Goodbye.  P.S. I recomend that you buy or read the book.
0618680004|1.0|He is pushing his Faith of Atheism to new limits in this book.  He is the Personification of Arrogance and Contempt toward people of faith.  He has no scientific data to refute that there is a spiritual realm or a life after death,  ignores countless peoples' testimonies of Near Death Experiences, present day miracles, testimonies of people such as myself having life changing and living relationships with Jesus Christ and closes his eyes to reams of evidence that life was intelligently designed. Questions of DNA, abiogenesis, the infinite complexity of living things, the forming of brains, eyes, that has perplexed scientists for centuries he dismisses with a wave of his old withered hand, deeming anything contrary to what he proclaims of no consequence as he sets himself up as the highest authority in the universe, having ultimate knowledge of this life and the next and everything in between.  Don't waste your time on an arrogant old atheist's bitter, insulting, unscientific, and hostile tirade against all people of faith.

159420229X|3.0|I found this book incredibly dry.  I wished there had been more focus on actual techniques than on history and the competitive circuit.  However, I did find the chapter on memory palaces quite captivating.  If the author had used the same clear approach in teaching how to memorize poems and numbers, I think that the book would have been a bit more interesting and useful.<br /><br />For those who compete in memory circuits or the like, I think this book would be a very good read because you would be able to make very palpable text to life connections.  The rest of us are kind of lost in the fray.<br /><br />Overall, I did get some enjoyment from the overall story.  The underdog, the author of the book (who has had no previous training and has average memory capabilities)trains for a year with some of the best in the industry and winds up winning one of the most coveted titles in the memory competition circuit.<br />Congratulations, Mr. Foer!  If only you could have imparted upon us exactly how you did it.
0553801473|2.0|I have to agree with many of the others the 5 star reviews for this book can not be true.<br /><br />The first three books were fantastic page turners with new surprising twists. The last two books seem to be nothing, but money grabs.  They have gotten longer and longer and nothing note worthy has really happened that couldn't have been done better in a shorter more concise book. G.R.R.M really needs to wrap up the story already and be done with it.  Most of his \\"surprises\\" of ending chapters on cliff hangers and killing and un-killing characters are just proving to be pointless and have no meaning to the overall story. The gimmick of this book taking place the same time as the last book leaves you right where you started 3K pages ago... no where.<br /><br />He did a recent interview where he was disappointed in the show \\"LOST\\" as it ended poorly and didn't have any direction.  Interesting he has fallen into the same trap.  It seems fairly obvious he doesn't have any plan on how to finish up the series.
B005BZQS1E|2.0|This is not the worst movie, it's just that with a cast like this, I was expecting it to be, well, at least good.  It had a few (and far between) chuckles, but was certainly not the HIGH times you'd expect.  It simply wasn't very funny.  I attribute that to a weak script more than on any failing of the actors.

B000VI70WM|5.0|I lost track of DD in the early 90's when I migrated to country music.  I got lost in that genre for a couple of decades until I tired of the same ol', same ol' sound.  After viewing a Behind the Music special on VH1 on Duran Duran, I purchased The Wedding Album in December of last year, and was re-hooked.  Until that purchase, the only other CD I owned of theirs was the Decade compilation CD.  After listening to The Wedding Album, I wanted more.  I bought All You Need is Now in March of this year.  Loved it.  Next came Astronaut (loved it), followed by Liberty (loved it), Big Thing (not so in love with it, but some good songs), and Medazzaland (very odd sounding but grows on you).  I based the order of my purchases predominantly on customer reviews.  I was hesitant to buy Medazzaland because there were so many negative reviews, and as I listened to that CD for the first time, I really wanted to turn it off.  I found that to be the case with Astronaut at first as well, but I found myself liking both of those CDs as I played them more.  What has really impressed me about Duran Duran is their willingness to grow as artists and to explore different ways of making music.  I don't want them to sound like Rio and Hungry Like the Wolf.  I think they have matured over the years and sound better than they did in their hey-day.  There were many negative reviews about Red Carpet Massacre, but I decided to buy it anyway.  I really like this album.  It's unexpectedly low key compared with what is \\"typically\\" expected for a Duran Duran release, but that's what I like about it; it's different.  I have tickets to see Duran Duran in Chicago on October 21st.  Thank God they are still doing live shows after being together for 30 years; otherwise, I would never have seen them live.  This will be my first Duran Duran concert (and hopefully not my last), and I am soon to be 48! Oh well, it will be a better show than it might have been twenty or more years ago since they have only gottenbetter over the years.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|Starts off intriguingly, with Hanna being trained by her father. It's still interesting when she is captured and tries to carry out her mission. But it soon degenerates. It's hard to root for her or Erik when they're killing poor working shmucks like lab techs and policemen.<br /><br />What's good: seeing Hanna react and adjust to the outside world - meeting electricity and other people and showers. I'd wager the lesbian-toned kiss between her and another teen is what earned all the critical acclaim, because the script is Luc Besson material (think Fifth Element, not Taken). Some \\"symbolism\\" in filming in Wilhelm Grimm's house, bad wolf, wicked witch, etc., but somewhat blunt.<br /><br />The climax is a letdown - for all their training, the promise of Hanna's training is feebly realized, and some main characters are taken down like rank amateurs. There is no intelligence to their final encounters, no smarts, no skill, no payoff for all that training. A superior movie in this regard would be Die Hard. There we see the hero and villains actually use their brains. As such, this movie is kind of a missed mess of genres.<br /><br />If I'd rented this for a dollar from Redbox, I'd still say it stank. But I rented it for $6 On Demand due to the high praise from idiot critics and I wouldn't recommend others watch it within the rental period - better to waste my money than their time. Watch it if you're desperate. You have been warned.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I watched the film version of Shutter Island in the theater and I really enjoyed it and I figured it was time to read the book.<br />Shutter Island is one of those books that you put everything on hold so you can continue reading. Author Dennis Lehane sets a chilling atmosphere throughout his novel. Although I had seen the film and knew what was happening, (the film stays pretty much true to the book), I was instantly lured in and enjoyed the creepy setting and intense storyline.<br /><br />This is a wonderful noir type psychological thriller. It is a bleak, doomed story that takes place in 1954 on a place called Shutter Island.<br />U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his deepest darkest secrets are at the core of this thriller. Nothing is as it seems and I love that about this story. I WISH I hadn't seen the film first!<br /><br />Teddy is sent to Shutter Island with his partner, Chuck Aule, to investigate the disappearance of a patient named Rachel Solando. Rachel was living at Ashecliffe Hospital on the island, a high security asylum for the criminally insane.<br />Shutter Island is accessible only by ferry, Rachel's room was locked and under strict watch, yet she managed to somehow disappear into thin air. The story is set amidst a hurricane on the island, and as the storm rages Teddy and Chuck begin to put the pieces of a horrible puzzle together in order to unravel the truth.<br />There is a lighthouse on Shutter Island, where crazy experiments and surgeries are rumored to take place.<br /><br />Teddy is a haunted soul, his wife Dolores died in a fire a few years ago. He loves his late wife to the point of anguish and blames himself for her death. Throughout the story Teddy has dreams and flashbacks involving Dolores, she haunts his every waking hour.<br />I felt bad for Teddy as I read, his situation is a sad one, he can't move on with his life since his wife died. I really wanted him to get off that island, no matter what his past was.<br /><br />Shutter Island itself is a menacing character in the story, and Teddy fears he will never be able to leave. He wonders if he has been lured there as part of a trap. He doesn't know who he can trust.<br /><br />\\"Ashecliffe Hospital sat on the central plain of the island's northwestern side. Sat benignly, I might add. It looked nothing like the hospital for the criminally insane and even less like the military barracks it had been before that.\\"<br /><br />I recommend Shutter Island to anyone looking for at thrilling, creepy read with mystery and surprises involved. The writing is wonderful, the storyline flows quickly and the characters are interesting.<br />What a fantastic setting this book has, a remote island housing some of the most violent mental patients with an investigation going on while a hurricane rages. At one point the power goes out, and the patients get out of their holding cells.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this read, it was perfect for this time of year.

B005974CDU|4.0|I am not going to add to the list of 130+ reviews that are 12 pages long - I'm pretty sure by this stage the overall score speaks for itself. Dream Theater delivers, and produces its best album since Scenes from a Memory. Mangini's very convincing debut makes it easy to forget Portnoy rather quickly - was he holding Dream Theater back the last few albums?
B002ZG98C8|2.0|Okay. This movie could had been a great movie, but what happened was there were too many big name stars than it actual needed. The stars in the movie were Danny Trejo, Steven Seagal, Robert De Niro, Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and Lindsay Lohan. They should had just had either Seagal or De Niro for the villain. They should had Michelle Rodriguez or Jessica Alba. Lindsay Lohan as the drug addicted daughter in the movie they didn't actually needed. They could had just had the mom be a addict if needed, but that whole part wasn't needed in the first place.<br /><br />If they could had did a better planning and editing in this movie, this movie could had been so great. As of now, it is just a if-if movie. But enough about what could had been, this was how the movie was. I thought Trejo played a great Machete. He was a great hero and acted his part well. Seagal acting wasn't as good as Trejo. He didn't play the villain as well. He seemed too cocky and overplayed his role. De Niro was a better villain than Seagal and should had been the main villain without Seagal as a partner. Rodriguez played a great hero role in the movie and was the best actor in the whole movie. Alba was okay, but was just eye candy in the movie. She shouldn't had been in the movie because she seemed misplaced in this movie and wasn't a good actor. Lohan was another eye candy actress in the movie. She too wasn't needed or her role.<br /><br />If there is another Machete movie, I hope they consider cutting down on the main stars list. Sometimes TOO MUCH is a BAD THING!
0321127420|3.0|Fowler is one of the most read writers on the topic of object-oriented programming.  Indeed, he captures the reader and most of his books, this one included, makes for a good read.  However, to my mind, and this is a personal opinion, I find the whole topic of patterns for object-oriented programming vague and imprecise.  I bought this book in the hope that it would reveal some structure underlying successful patterns of enterprise design, but I was disappointed.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|I wanted to give this movie 1 star, but since Vanessa in it - I guess 2 stars. lol  This is just a modern day retelling of Beauty and the Beast but done very badly. The screenwriters made this movie more of a teen chick flick than what it should had been.  In the beginning of Beauty and the Beast there is a witch that goes to the guy/prince for help and when he doesn't help her, the witch puts a curse on him. In this movie, it's more the witch just shows up and is just there. The guy makes fun of her and so she gets back at him with a curse. This was close to the story main point, but doesn't really work if you already know the true Beauty and the Beast story.   All the teen flick ideas comes in by the guy actually caring about what other High School teen think about the guy. The guy best friend and his girlfriend cheats on the guy. Who cares? Then, a few other stuff that wasn't needed for this movie, but to make it into more of a teen flick.  I really didn't like the guy in this movie. This movie him get a beautiful girl too easy just because he has money. You can be really ugly and just have money to get a beautiful girl that what I saw. Also, most people would call him a stalker because he follows her around nightly. He goes though her web page account and learns things about her. She gets knock out and immediately takes her away. Then, he demands her to leave with him. He says it's for her protection, but we all know that he really a super stalker!  Vanessa looks hot as she usually does, but since this isn't high school musical, she doesn't have much acting skills. Also, since she not signing songs, she has to make up the difference in talent, but she doesn't have the skills too. So, she was just okay to be in this bad movie.  I don't recommend this movie. Just go get the Disney cartoon version is still better than this.

B005U9RQNU|4.0|Once in a while, those that produce television programs actually get it right. They produce a program that is well written, properly filmed, properly cast, and tells a story that grabs your interest as well as your intellect, and presents it in a manner that keeps you riveted to the screen.   The producers of Breaking Bad have accomplished all of these. I am confident that this program will become a measuring stick for all dramatic programs from hence forward. Thank you for producing a TV program that entertains me to such an extent that I actually schedule other activities around the programs time slot.

B002XTXG1G|5.0|Must be watched multiple times.  After the intial shock of the first viewing, Hardy's perfomance makes you want to watch it over and over. Hardy really shows off his acting chops in BRONSON. The most disturbing part about the film is that is was based on an actual person, who is still in prison.  Looking foward to more movies fom Tom Hardy.
0062060554|4.0|I recently read a request on the mystery forum to list spellbinders that don't include murders. Well, here you go. There's an almost murder that causes a lot of grief for Christine, the protagonist, who sometimes wishes it had been successful, but it was more of an attempted murder, kind of second degree if you will.<br /><br />Christine wakes up every morning with no memory of who she is, usually alongside a man called Ben who eventually tells her he's her husband. When she goes to the bathroom there are lots of pictures of Christine with Ben but little else. Christine is hiding something from Ben. She's been going to see a psychologist, and she's been keeping a kind of journal of her memories, which she hides in a shoebox in the closet when she's finished writing. Gradually she begins to remember things.<br /><br />Also she eventually remembers a friend named Claire. Ben has answers for all of her memories that are inconsistent with what he's been telling her. He knows she'll only forget again that night. But she's written something at the beginning of her journal: \\"Don't trust Ben.\\"<br /><br />When she wakes up each morning she thinks she's a young woman, but is shocked to find a much older woman looking back at her in the mirror. Ben tells her she's 47. She also eventually learns that she spent seven years at a kind of home for the mentally ill called Waring House, and that Ben came to see her most every day.<br /><br />S.J. Watson is very good at doling out little hints as the novel progresses. I could have kicked myself for not figuring it out much earlier than I did. I read a lot of mysteries and S.J. Watson follows all the rules: you're supposed to show the murderer or the attempted murderer in this case if only briefly and she certainly does that. The smartest move she makes as a writer who's trying to throw the reader off a bit is to change a name, and that's what got me I suppose.<br /><br />I guess I've seen a similar movie or two, but this is definitely not your typical mystery or thriller or whatever you want to call it. For a while there, I thought all three major characters besides Christine (Ben, the doctor, and Claire) were doing a number on her. So, like Sherlock Holmes when he's outfoxed by Dr. Moriarty, you just have to give author S.J. Watson his or her due.you want to call it.

030788743X|5.0|Positive: 80's nostalgia. As a child of the 80's, I adored all the references (and I got most of them except the most obscure games and shows). It took me back to a time of day-glow, big hair, and awesome TV. Like, totally.<br /><br />Positive: The Big Bad Corporation bent on world domination. There had to be a bad guy, you know, and IOI completely fits the bill. Not only do they have an entire department devoted to finding the keys and gates hidden in OASIS (called the oology department, since they're searching for virtual Easter eggs), they're willing to kill anyone who gets there first.<br /><br />Positive: The online world. It's like World of Warcraft and Second Life and Call of Duty plus every other game you can think of in one place. And it's free! Plus, when you're online, it's not just 2-D like nowadays. It's fully 3-D and, if you have enough money, can even include smell. Yeah, I can see how some people would never want to leave, if their reality sucked.<br /><br />Wish: That there was an online world as wild as OASIS (though I don't want our real world to be that crappy. Because it was really, really bad.). I mean, how cool would it be to fly the Serenity around Weadonverse? Or sneak aboard the Death Star? Or go on a quest for an Easter egg worth billions of dollars?<br /><br />Overall: A can't miss for anyone who loves the 80's and gaming, READY PLAYER ONE is an absolutely fantastic, unputdownable read.

B004ZNACA6|5.0|I will start this review off by saying I'm less than 20 years old (not giving my real age, so that's going to have to do.) Therefore, I haven't been listening to Pink Floyd since \\"back in the day\\". Really, I didn't start listening to them until last year. I had of course listened to their 4 big albums (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall) and I loved every single one. However, I still wished the listen to the rest of their stuff, as well as actually own my own copies of those 4. That's where this box set comes in.  For someone like me who just wants the music, this is perfect. It's bare bones stuff, yes, but that's all I really need. I can certainly understand the complaints about there not being any bonus stuff, and I will agree more should have been added to make this an amazing box set for long-time Pink Floyd fans. I, personally, don't need any of that stuff. I'm happy with it just the way it is.
B00474GUEA|4.0|I don't know how this album didn't blow up. I guess it was about 3 years ahead of it's time. While the Chromatics are too sexy and gritty to be considered chill-wave you can definitely see how they saw it coming all the way from 2007.     Hands down the best cover song of 2007. The the title track is one best tracks of 2007. All and all Night Dive is easily one of the most overlooked albums of 2007.

B003L77GH4|5.0|A combination of GREAT writing, characters, acting, flashbacks, costumes, special effects and music make this series sensational.  The stories deviate from the books, but only in ways that improve the stories visually. This is not your typical vampire saga. It will appeal to fans of the \\"Moonlight\\" series and the Twilight Saga\\" books and movies, but I feel that \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" is a lot more appealing, dramatic and action-packed.  Watching the entire 22-program season on DVD without commercials is a real treat for fans after having to wait a week in between TV broadcasts all season long. The extra disc included also contains some terrific background information, and I really enjoyed the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" featurettes and bloopers. I suggest that those who have never seen the series on TV watch the entire first season of the series on DVD or online before purchasing the second series DVDs.

B004J4WQ46|3.0|The good news is these songs don't suck.  It's an album full of pretty decent songs.  The first track, Machu Pichu is actually pretty great.  After their first 2 one dimensional, albeit awesome albums, the band is showing an appreciation for other sounds like keys, etc.  So, they've progressed...sort of.  The problem is that these songs sound like cover songs.  You can hear when they're being influenced by Radiohead on 'You're So Right' and various 80's bands throughout the album.  It's ok to be influenced, it's just a bit overboard on this album and I'm left wondering, who are the strokes?  I applaud their new musicianship, but it gets in the way at times.

B000035Z3K|3.0|DRACULA<br /><br />While not the first vampire movie to be released, nor the greatest, Dracula deserves a place in horror as the most defining image of the famous blood drinker.  In fact, since the 1980s, Hollywood has been trying to redefine the vampire, steering it away from the classic portrayal by Bela Lugosi, but it is a hard sell.  Lugosi took the role and made it his, and he did it so well that it is still nearly impossible to think of the word Dracula without conjuring his image.<br /><br />The 1931 Dracula follows the classic story fairly consistently.  Being the first sound version of the tale, it seems fitting that Universal would remain truer to the novel, even if just to stake its claim.  The plot should be familiar to everyone at this point, but in case you have never seen it, the story involves Renfield--a naive real-estate man--traveling to remote Eastern Europe from London to arrange for Count Dracula's transport to England.  Renfield is a modern man, and the furthest thing from his reality is the possibility of vampires.  He would rather believe the strange count is just eccentric, and that his castle is just old and spooky.  Dracula makes Renfield his slave, gets to enlightened London, and begins to feed on the unsuspecting locals.  Van Helsing is the only one who suspects Dracula's true nature, and devises a plan to destroy the beast, while saving his next victims.<br /><br />It's a great movie overall, but truth be told, it has a lot of weaknesses.  The story is that most of the people involved in it's making thought it was going to flop, that the public had no interest in vampire films, and so most of the energy put into it was weak at best.  A lot of the acting is bland, and after Dracula gets to London, it seems like everything got a lot less interesting.  The dialogue is un-interesting, the actor's delivery is dry, the sets are unexciting, and the camera work ordinary.  Then, after 30 or so minutes of boring dialogue, they go and stake Dracula and that's the end.<br /><br />But the first 20 minutes are really fantastic.  Dracula's castle is convincingly constructed and looks real.  It's a total wreck, with fallen stones and cobwebs everywhere--it reeks of decay.  How Renfield could have supposed any mortal to be able to live in this place is amazing.  The effect is creepy and adds considerably to the feeling of a present evil.  The interaction between Renfield and Dracula is great, with long silences and gazing looks, and the infamous lines Lugosi utters all lend to the atmosphere.<br /><br />Lugosi is credited with saving the film, and with good reason.  He is unbelievable in the role as Dracula.  His entire role was on the mark and convincing.  You can tell he really enjoyed the part and lived up to it.  Rumors have it Lugosi kept in character the entire filming, and I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case.  Credit should also be given to Dwight Frye who plays Renfield.  It's a very interesting character that goes from a stiff suit to a raving maniac who eats bugs all day.  When the two of them are on the screen together, it's electric.  All their scenes together are terrific, memorable.  They alone are the reasons to watch this movie, but I think it is reason enough.<br /><br />Lugosi transformed the vampire in film with this one role, and that is worth seeing, too.  Instead of playing the part as a revolting, undead devil, Lugosi added a complexity still used in the vampire role.  He is evil, his habits strange, his mannerisms suspicious, but he is also elegant, charming, and unassuming.  That's why the Lugosi vampire is so frightening, because it is like a sheep in wolves clothing.<br /><br />I feel like this movie stands as a great due to the Lugosi factor, but keep in mind that an alternate version exists, shot with all the same sets, but with Spainish actors instead.  It's a superior movie, much more interesting than the popular English version.  Its only downside is it lacks Lugosi.  Ifonly Uiversal had combined the efforts of both movies, we would have had possible the greatest horror film of all time.have had possible the greatest horror film of all time.
B003L77G38|5.0|The third season is definitely a must have, great acting and stories.Fringe has continued to entertain, amuse, shock and totally take viewers on a roller coaster ride from one week to the next, and each season is better than the last. John Noble is so excellent as the absolutely diabolical but lovable mad scientist Walter that I can't for the life of me understand why Emmy Awards haven't been thrust at him every year. Anna Torv is that rare female actress who appeals equally to men and women, and quite possibly the only female lead on television who dresses appropriately for her job as an FBI agent. Her Olivia is a polished jewel, both beautiful and smart! Joshua Jackson was such a surprise to me because I didn't expect him to be up to the caliber of his castmates, but I was so wrong -- he is brilliant as the super-smart once bad boy Peter. The threesome is surrounded by interesting and quirky characters to fill out the ensemble, especially Lance Reddick as the head of the FBI's Fringe Division, and Jasika Nicole as the utterly delightful Agent and Walter-sitter Astrid, whose name he never seems to remember correctly but always speaks with adoring admiration.
B000JVT1U0|4.0|THE WICKER MAN<br /><br />What makes The Wicker Man a horror film, since it lacks psychos, monsters, magic, supernatural powers, or the paranormal?  The film is more of a mystery than a horror flick, but seen through the eyes of the films hero, Inspector Howie, it most certainly is horror.  In this respect, it's a culturally subjective horror film, for any good pagan would watch this without so much as a flinch or a shutter.<br /><br />The movie takes place on a beautiful island off the coast of Scotland.  Warmed by the Gulf Stream Winds, it is a place known for it's prodigious fruit production.  Inspector Howie is summoned to the island to investigate the possible murder of a young girl.  It's a frustrating mystery as Howie tries to figure out what has become of her, and his inquiries inadvertently uncover that the people here are no longer Christians and have reverted back to the beliefs and practices of their pagan ancestors.<br /><br />This is greatly upsetting to Howie.  Howie is the sort of man who has made self control and reason his life's purpose.  He is a true Apollonian, a believer in the seriousness of life.  He has worked hard to become an inspector, is due to be married, is a very faithful Christian, and has maintained his sexual purity.  Counter to this are the locals, revelers in the ways of Dionysus, people who enjoy life, singing and dancing, a people for whom the ceremonies and morals of Christianity mean nothing, a people who have little need for the modern, civilized way of life.<br /><br />To make matters worse, it is spring, and so in true pagan form, the people are preparing for the islands fertility rites.  Couples make love in the open, children sing songs about procreation, phallic symbols are everywhere.  If this were not enough to turn Howie's stomach, he also has to contend with the buxom waitress in his hotel.  Not only does she flirt with him every chance she gets, but she even stoops so low as to blatantly invite the chaste inspector for a night of fun in her room, singing softly to him through the bedroom wall while dancing nude in some sort of sexual ritual.  Yeah, it's a great scene!<br /><br />Howie doesn't take the bait, nor does he ever come to terms with anything he witnesses on the island.  His horror is so great he threatens to turn their whole society inside out as punishment for their wicked ways, till he finds the pagan leader, Lord Summerisle, who politely reminds Howie that nothing illegal is taking place, and so he has no recourse.  Unless that is, he can find the body of the young girl whom Howie suspects was some sort of sacrifice.<br /><br />If you have seen the new remake of the movie, you'll have an idea of what happens next, but you should still see this movie.  It is one of the most well made films ever made, in any genre of movies.  Much of this has to do with the fantastic script and acting, but even more so with the interesting subject material and setting.  The pagan rituals, songs, fetishes and lifestyle are stunningly captured.  The film's crescendo is at the end with the May Day festive ushering in the spring, where everybody dresses up, more sexual insinuations are made, and Howie reaches his boiling point.  When all these elements are tied together, you end up with a beautiful movie that is entirely fascinating.<br /><br />Like I said before, your take on the film may be entirely subjective.  I felt like I wanted to take sides in this, and I certainly believe there is a polar duality at play here that is hard to remain nonpartisan through.  At times I sympathized with Howie, and it's hard not to.  But he comes off as a jerk mostly, and the locals increasingly become more likable.  It's not till the end that you may find your opinion of Howie really changes once everything becomes clear and his destiny unfolds.  This is where the new Wicker Man really screwed up.  The original really hits the point home and the end is breathtaking, a true work of art that words cannot justify.
B005LAJ1CC|5.0|I just finished watching this on cable over the span of the last two days, parts 1 and 2, but as far as I'm concerned they could have run the entire documentary in one day, and I would have sat through the entire 5-hour uminterrupted run.  A nicely done biography courtesy of Martin Scorsese on the life, music, and personality of \\"the quiet Beatle.\\"  Although some of the editing was a bit choppy on some of the musical footage, I found the biography to be a fascinating look into a performer I didn't really know about as much as I thought I did.<br /><br />One thing you come away with is that George, in his aspiration to spread love, was greatly loved in return by friends and family for a lot of obvious reasons.  What was really nice to see is that he was accepted with his moody side as well, something lots of people look at in others first, disregarding the rest.  Of all the people interviewed for commentary, the most inciteful ones seemed to be Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, and wife Olivia.<br /><br />George's religious philosophy and world views may not necessarily be eye to eye with your own, but anyone who is trying to make a difference in the lives of the lesser off and is a true advocate for positive change is a good icon for the world at large.  Apparently the quiet Beatle had a gift for reaching out and opening people's minds at a one-on-one level, though not good at delivering speeches in front of thousands.  He was obviously very personable, candid, and passionate about the things that he believed in.  That passion--or any--can make an orator out of a mute.  Funny how one of the most telling things about him was his eyes!  You can see the depths of his emotions constantly, and maybe the weight of the world was something he placed too firmly on his own shoulders.  You would be moody too!<br /><br />In contrast, we see he had a very playful side, loved mischief, and got simple joy out of colors, flowers, and close friendships.  Unfortunately, the mischief veered into unfortunate territory for the main women in his life, and Olivia makes it plain in what she says about him--or, rather, what she DOESN'T say.  \\"The key to a long marriage...Don't get divorced,\\" speaks volumes on her thoughts about his quirks and aberrant behavior.  She was trying to be graceful without giving details, but not too many people appreciate infidelity.  Was he a good husband?  Well, it's very obvious she loved him, which covers up a multitude of foibles.  Was he a good father?  It certainly looked like it to me, because Dhani seems to be a good kid, and boy, he sure looks a lot like his dad!  Was he a good friend?  Undoubtedly.  Was he a great spiritualist?  He tried his hardest with lots of success.  Was he a great musician?  Ringing affirmative!<br /><br />Moments that stand out in the film:<br />George standing protectively by John's side after Stu Sutcliffe passed away while Astrid shot their photos.<br /><br />George laughing and singing along to \\"This Boy\\" while viewing an old Beatle performance.<br /><br />Eric Clapton's recounting the entire Patty Boyd situation.<br /><br />The wonderful footage of that huge, sprawling mansion.<br /><br />All the interviews with Tom Petty, from the funny ukelele story to his recounting of George's post Orbison death comment:  \\"Aren't you glad it's not you?\\"  Well, at least he was bold enough to say what most people are thinking anyway.<br /><br />The music footage, of course, and getting to see nearly everyone who was anybody in it!<br /><br />The most touching part for me was after that lunatic broke into the estate, nearly killing George and Olivia, forcing them to have to fight back.  The results of the attack seemed to bring out the best thing for George in his preparation for death:  closure.  His telling Olivia that he finally figured out he really had to let go of all his bitterness and be more forgiving made me want to take stock in the way I've been conducting my own life, and maybe it's time to be more spiritual myself.  No matter what your faith is, forgiveness can do wonderful things--well, I've generally seen it in other people.<br /><br />To sum it up, this was an excellent account of George's life because it didn't put him on a sugary pedestal.  It was brutally and delightfully honest, portraying the man as a multi-talented, intelligent, loving, spiritual human being with flaws like anyone else.  His major goal toward the end of his life was to be more and more God conscious.  In closing, all I can say is bless you, George.re spiritual myself.  No matter what your faith is, forgiveness can do wonderful things--well, I've generally seen it in other people.<br /><br />To sum it up, this was an excellent account of George's life because it didn't put him on a sugary pedestal.

0671027344|1.0|I loved this book in high school. I think I made everyone that I knew read it because I praised it so highly.  Now, I am a graduate student and I decided to give it another read.  WOW. This book is horrible. It was entertaining to relive the story, but now that I'm an adult, I find the characters in this book to be so selfish and shallow.  If you enjoyed this book, you need to rethink your life's priorities. I would recommend by starting with reading The Art of Happiness by the Dalai Lama.

0307477479|1.0|I can't understand what all the acclaim is about- the characters were weak, and seemingly were portrayed in such a stereotypical fashion because the author really did not understand the world of which she was writing. That is also probably what made it so popular with the \\"Oprah\\" crowd who thought they were taking \\"a walk on the wild side\\", albeit such an ordinary and false one.

0553384775|5.0|Interesting how the 5 star and 1 star reviews are about equal! I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I don't know if it tells the full story, as some reviewers complain it doesn't, and it does not address the wreckage wreaked upon clients by Stratton's pump and dump schemes, but the story told was fascinating; funny in the right places, interesting to follow.
B004J1DBJI|1.0|Unless you're asking fairly basic questions, Wolfram Alpha doesn't work any better than asking the same question in Google or Bing. Bing actually works slightly better with complex questions. e.g. Attempting to quickly calculate the irradiance at 1 inch from a source with irradiance of 100,000 microwatts per square centimeter.  Wolfram Alpha returns definitions &amp; statistics on the word 'source' or other useless trash. Rephrasing the query dozens of times results in nonsense.  Faster to run the formula manually using the calculator app.

B005KP7EK4|5.0|Sam Shepard is no novice to the thoughtful, landscape-driven Western. This film posits the question: What if Butch Cassidy hadn't been gunned down by the Bolivian army, but instead lived to old age in exile. It picks up with him as an old man considering a return to his long lost home, but along the way he is sidetracked, and some of his old ways (and old acquaintances) come back to haunt him.   The performances here in every way match the beauty of the landscape photography here. This is an excellent character study with a nice conversation regarding the nature of true crime.
0670022950|4.0|I wrote my dissertation influenced by Ernst Cassirer's idea that the idea of Humanity was a galvanizing one during the Enlightenment. So, I am really glad to see how Steven Pinker provides sufficient evidence to show that the impact of the Enlightenment Humanism was overwhelmingly positive. I was a bit disappointed, however, in reading the section on it that he gives such short shrift to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In fact, he locates him only as a Counter-Enlightenment figure.  It is true that he quarreled with philosophes who had an unthinking faith in reason and other advances in arts and letters, and many people blame him both for the terreur that followed the French Revolution as well as the later totalitarianism of the 20th century.  They both do him a grave injustice. In his La Nouvelle Heloise, which Pinker rightly emphasizes, Rousseau's characters over and over again enjoin each other to be human and respect the rights of humanity. In his Emile, he wants to raise an ordinary boy, who treats everyone, high and low, the same.  His Social Contract not only criticizes the institution of slavery, but advocates self government. Rousseau was very aware that both reason and passion, if not rightly directed, can just serve self interest. Kant was also very influenced by Rousseau, he said it was Rousseau who taught him that the vocation of philosophy was to defend the rights of humanity.  Kant also saw that reason itself is not sufficient, you need a good will to do the right thing. Denis Diderot has also often not been given his due, either. Whereas most of the other philosophes were hoping for enlightened despots, Diderot said we should be wary of those most of all as they condition people to obedience.  In my thesis, I was not interested in a fixed theory of human nature, but was more interested in how we have historically defined ourselves as both civilized and humane, and how often we have fallen short of that definition.  Pinker's voluminous testimony seems to show that despite our problems, there is still hope that we can listen to the better angels of our nature.that despite our problems, there is still hope that we can listen to the better angels of our nature.

We live out of state where his bakery is but we will be traveling to get there in a few weeks to eat there, can't wait.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I think most people know about the movie itself so I won't spend too much on the movie. The Lion King is one of those Disney timeless classics originally released in theaters on June 15, 1994.  The quality of the movie is very good. Blu Ray does a lot of justice for this movie and Disney did a very good job cleaning up the movie for a high quality release for both image and sound.  I purchased the 3D version of this movie, it also contains the 2D version of the movie so if you are thinking about buying a 3D tv in the near future you should consider paying the extra few bucks now to future proof your purchase for 3D if that's something that interests you.  The interactive menus are very nice and easy to use.  I use a PS3 as my Blu-ray player.

The student is in denial when the drug dealer tries to get her to see that \\"teach is a basehead\\". The acting in this movie is good, Anthony Mackie does a good job as Frank the drug dealer. Good Movie

B004EPZ0BG|3.0|Mila Kunis is Jamie, a young New York headhunter. Justin Timberlake is Dylan, an art director living in LA. When Jamie recruits Dylan for the job of \\"GQ\\" magazine, they agree to start a relationship which is strictly \\"physical.\\" Having just broken up with a boyfriend/girlfriend, Jamie and Dylan think everything will be fine - a relationship without complications and emotional baggage. Of course, it works ... for a while.  Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake (if not the characters they play) are so likable and charming that you almost forget \\"Friends with Benefits\\" (directed by Will Gluck, \\"Easy A\\") eventually becomes what it is mocking, a formulaic romantic Hollywood comedy. Without their spirited performances the raunchy rom-com would have been a mess. While we all know where the film's story is going, we are ready to accept it, clichés and all.   Supporting actors include Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson and Richard Jenkins. They all turn in solid acting jobs, and cameos from Masi Oka, Andy Samberg, Emma Stone and Shaun White (as himself) may add a few laughs, but it is the beautifully shot locations of New York City and Los Angeles that are really attractive.   Thank to the two leads, \\"Friends with Benefits\\" is a better than average romantic comedy, which is an old-fashioned love story at heart with a few modern twists.  Not to be confused with TV series \\"Friends with Benefits.\\" Also, \\"Friends with Benefits\\" happens to be one of the working titles of Ivan Reitman-directed \\"No Strings Attached\\" starring the \\"Black Swan\\" star Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. It's a little bit confusing.

Now let me start off by saying I have no \\"set\\" religion. I am not an athiest I just simply don't have a particular God or religion I believe in or pray to. I'm very open-minded and open to all ideas. Now let me also say I am thoroughly convinced that we are not the only planet with life. Millions of start and planets and WE are the only beings out there? Huh-uh...I don't buy it, not one bit. I intend to read this again and I just started Erich Von Daniken's book \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" and I have asked for \\"History is Wrong\\" for xmas (I have yet to read it). If you are open-minded or just want a very thought-provoking book (I know I keep using those words) this is a definite must. I love this subject and I love this book. Even if you're a close-minded person and you have that \\"there are no aliens and there never have been\\" mentality even you will think twice after reading this and it will make you think \\"you know, maybe...\\" Greatest book I've ever read. Thank you Erich Von Daniken.

B005J9ZDYK|5.0|a new collection of Shaun the Sheep  Tales is always reason to cheer.  i have been waiting for this new collection for quite some time. the new episodes  have been released on DVD piece meal, seven tales at a time under various DVD titles, but no complete collection, then  i recently found these all season two episodes on my NetFlix  Video Streaming Service.  i then checked Amazon and found the Second Season was being offered as a PRE ORDER with a due date of November 15.  i did a bit of research and discovered that the set consisted of  forty episodes.  i placed my pre order without hesitation.  i am not going to go over each of the forty episodes, as time and space would not permit it.  suffice it to say, the tales are great fun  to watch.  i've watched some with one of my grand daughters (age 11) and the enjoyment she she displayed  will warm the heart of any grandparent.  all the episodes are worthwhile and be sure to notice all the attention to detail that is diplayed.  the hard work that goes into making these small inanimate creatures move and act as if they're actually alive is impossible to comprehend. Shaun the Sheep, his flock, Bitzer the dog, The Farmer and all the other \\"actors\\" are truly works of genius by the tatented people who bring them to life.  you cannot go wrong in purchasing this Second Season Collection.  i only hope that these characters will  continue to be brought to life by this band of creators inm future episodes and collections.    there is one small item i do take issue with.  the characters of Bitzer and The Farmer, as wsell as several others have their appearance changed from the way they were originally presented.  i prefer the original way over the current appearence.  it isn't a major issue however.

B0012Q732O|5.0|I liked this movie since it first came out and now I keep it with my collection of good movies to have. It is not historically correct, nor does the geopraphic setting make sense, but it has great special effects. It is a fantasy and a love story in a prehistoric age, which I find is great for teenagers. The movie has no profanity or sex-filled screens like many of the modern movies. I recommend it.

This thing is excellent for the price, i honestly have nothing but good things to say about it. It is probably one of the simplest to install and use (just make sure you have an optical audio output on your television obviously). The sound is clean and clear, it won't disappoint believe me. If you have taken your time reading this review, just buy it, there is no need to look anywhere else.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|This movie is a very good comedy styled as a documentary on a Troll Hunter and Trolls.  The scene with the Troll Hunter baiting a Troll with a bucket full of a Christian man's blood was hilarious.  I guess, according to the legend, Trolls don't like Christians. They become violent when Christians are present.  So the question was asked how the Trolls would respond to the presence of the Muslim camerawoman. The response was, \\"I guess we will find out.\\"  One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.
1401324517|4.0|What a wonderful and insightful tennis read!! Since we love him, reading Rafa's life/tennis story was quite interesting. He seems to have as much love for tennis as we have for him. Truly a responsible, respectful individual and very real(loved the story about him buying a sports car). Uncle Toni is a task master, not one that we would survive under. It is a tribute to Rafa, Roger and now Nole that the guys on the top are great guys and have a tremendous amount of respect for each other and TENNIS. No divas. No abuse to those working the tournaments. Times have certainly changed and Rafa et al are responsible for a lot of that. Probably too tennis-detailed  point by point descriptions) for not true enthusiasts.

B005CMSDLE|1.0|I ordered this movie about the 7th of September and I still haven't received it yet. Today is the 10th of October.  I've contacted Crystal's Consumer Connection and they still haven't been able to get the item to me.  I need a refund.  I've already checked the movie out at the video store and watched it.  Why do I need the movie now.  I thought that I would get it earlier so I could tell people that I had seen it, but I can't do that now.  Anyway the movie wasn't that great.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|Well, I just spent a few extra bucks to get this movie with the digital copy. It EXPIRED! Warner Brothers says that it clearly states that it expires September 13, 2011. By clearly they mean once you have already bought it, opened it up, it is printed in small print INSIDE the packaging where you would activate the digital copy. How dumb of me to not know this when ordering on-line. Even if you bought in personyou would have to open the case up to see this. Something that gets you arrested if you don't buy it first...  Well at least other movie studios like Disney actually try to take care of their customers and offer real digital copies and not misleading lies on the front cover.

B001N18HO6|4.0|I have been a pearl jam die hard fan since june of 1992, and though i havent always agreed with eds politics i have always had their backs as a fan much as one would your best friend or your brother, that said i loved the rewards bestowed to us true fans in the delux oackage except for 1 thing! Why the 7 song edited version of unplugged dvd? I had recorded this on VhS the night it aired on tv and literally wore the thing out til the tape broke. Ever since that fated day in 1996 when my copied version broke all i have ever wanted was a full length version of this show and i was so excited i was going to get it in the set just to open it and realize that it was cut down and i felt like the kid that had asked for one small thing for christmas and waited patiently all year for it in this case closer to 20, and then to give me just a part of it? what was the point of pulling out the rest? I still love these guys, always will, i grew up with these guys, have spent 3/4s of my life listening to and spending countless thousands of dollars gladly i just wanted the full thing. I'm sure neither Ed, Jeff, Mike, Stone or Matt really care or anyone else for that matter but it would be nice if someday i could pay and receive the full length show of their 93 unplugged show. I'm just one greatfull fan that will always follow these guys and thats like a needle in a mountain of needles, but it would be really cool to someday get that show hat isnt a bootleg that is something band wants to share with fans and friends that have stuck with them for 20 yrs and hopefully 20 more! keep up the good work guys and you've earned all the respect fans and peers alike have given you for so many years and for the most part have done so with grace!<br /><br />ps Mike McCready and Jeff Ament are the 2 most over looked, dismissed bass and lead players in the history of rock or any other genre ever. I love you guys and i love all my PJ fans that have hung in thru the good and the bad, a true music fan and their loyalty to what and who they believe in is a beautiful side of life too few people take time to notice! ok I'll shut up now, thanks to anyone who cared to read and/or understand!loyalty to what and who they believe in is a beautiful side of life too few people take time to notice! ok I'll shut up now, thanks to anyone who cared to read and/or understand!

B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty McCreery emerged as the winner of American Idol's tenth season in 2011 after wowing audiences with his powerful and strong deep voice, as well as his down-to-earth, humble, and laid-back personality. His debut album, Clear As Day, is excellent and wonderfully displays his powerful vocals and great range on both fun, upbeat songs; inspirational songs; slow, heartfelt tearjerkers; etc, all reflecting his personality. The album was wonderful with the first listen, and it just gets even more and more addictive with each and every listen.  1. \\"Out Of Summertime\\" is a great, uptempo start to the album, describing a couple of teens who meet and are together over summer; however, they are not able to remain a couple and form a long-term relationship because of running \\"out of summertime\\" and having to move on. It's a great and fun song; however, it is a little repetitive with the chorus repeats, but it doesn't really detract from it at all.  2. \\"I Love You This Big\\" is the first single and became a top 15 hit for him, having recently gone gold. It's a nice, sweet song of expressing how much you love someone.   3. \\"Clear As Day\\" is the slowest song on the entire album, as well as one of the saddest. It starts out sweet, but it later at the end turns sad and tragic. The song speaks of situations in a young couple's life, and how the man remembers everything and his memories are always \\"clear as day\\".  4. \\"The Trouble With Girls\\" is the second single and another sweet song. It talks about all the things girls do that make guys like them - \\"they smile that smile, and they bat those eyes. They steal you with hello; they kill you with goodbye. They hook you with one touch, and you can't break free\\". However, he sings of this positively as \\"the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me\\". This is definitely one of my favorites.  5. \\"Water Tower Town\\" is another favorite of mine, and I love how it greatly reflects Scotty's life, upbringing, hometown, etc. and how he sings it (as all the other songs) with such passion. It discusses life in a small town - \\"In a water tower town, everybody waves, church doors are the only thing that's open on Sunday, word travels fast, wheels turn slow, yeah workin' hard and livin' right is the only life we know, Friday night football is king, sweet tea goes good with anything, the fireflies come out when the sun goes down, nobody eats til you say amen...\\" I greatly hope he releases this as a single, and I predict if he does, it will be a huge success for him, as there are many people across America that can relate.  6. \\"Walk In The Country\\" is a fun song that's clearly country and was originally a Keith Urban song from his days with his band The Ranch. It speaks of getting away from everything and \\"walkin' in the country\\". I love the song, and I personally think it's a little ironic that he sings in the second verse, \\"I'm so sick of these TV shows...\\" when it was a TV show that helped him achieve his dream. :) Shining performance, though!  7. \\"Better Than That\\" is a very fun, upbeat love song, detailing all these great things that have happened to him in life, \\"first crush, first kiss, first time I saw the ocean... baseball and summer nights...\\" and how he thought nothing could beat them all, yet his girl's love is better than everything else. It has a great tune and could be a big hit as a single as well.  8. \\"Write My Number On Your Hand\\" is a great, upbeat song as well, that starts out at first sounding a little like \\"Good Directions\\", but then comes into its own, and again, could be a great hit single. It speaks of a couple meeting and having fun over summer, and to remember him, he wants her to \\"write [his] number on [her] hand\\". I love the \\"twist\\" at the end. It's easily one of the more addictive, sing-along songs and an overall feel-good song.  9. \\"Dirty Dishes\\" should definitely be released as a single, as it is easily one of the top best songs on the album and, again, easy to relate to for many, with the mother praying, \\"I wanna thank you, Lord, for noisy children and slamming doors, clothes scattered all over the floor, a husband working all the time, dragging in dead tired at night, a never-ending messy kitchen, and dirty dishes\\". It's a very positive, up-lifting message about appreciating everything you have instead of seeing all the annoyances or imperfections.  10. \\"You Make That Look Good\\" is another fun, upbeat love song, expressing how he has things that may not be overly great in appearance to some; however, his girl makes it all look good. It's just a very sweet, tribute song.  11. \\"Back On The Ground\\" is a wonderful song of staying grounded and humble through everything: \\"Ain't it funny how it all comes back around? I remember when I couldn't wait to get out of her hair and ditch this town. I was restless, time to move on. Now it's any reason to go back home. That's what it's all about. Yeah, I'm just slowin' down to get my feet back on the ground\\".  12. \\"That Old King James\\" is an excellent way to close out the album, and I love that he has this song on here, representing his Christianity. The songs details an old King James Bible that has been passed down from grandfather to his mother to him and how it has affected them all, sharing the importance of passing down the Bible from generation to generation.  Every single song on here could easily be a single, and they are all wonderful choices to represent Scotty. The songs are easy to relate to, fun to sing along to, and inspirational, making this an overall very powerful album that you can't help but feel good after listening to.   I also suggest getting the WalMart version of the \\"ZinePak\\", which comes not only with the CD, but it also has a 72 page magazine book that he helped put together, sharing photos, well wishes from other country artists, lyrics, short entries of what the songs mean to him, trivia, etc. I am already eagerly awaiting more material from this great, fresh young talent!!!
B001GBUD4A|5.0|This album could not miss in my collection and remastered version is always more extensive and better. The best thing is that I got together with two more sonata albums, a week before the promised date. (Y)
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Loved, Loved this Album.  Scotty has a wonderful voice.<br />Can't wait for him to start a 2nd album. This is why there was<br />no guessing who was going to win American Idol and why he<br />won.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|i like this movie a lot, best one yet!! i really hope that they continue the series, james mcavoy was great
B0050PYNP8|5.0|If you haven't watched Paul, watch it. Paul is a really funny movie about an Alien trying to get home when he runs into the funny guys from Shaun of the Dead who happen to be english nerds visiting America to see Comic Con, along with visiting a few alien hot spots, traveling through the midwest in an Rv. It is extremely funny as long as your not crazy about religion and can take a joke. It is also not for kids.<br />Paul has easily become my favorite movie, I love the characters, I love the jokes, I love the midwest. Ha!Ha!
B000003S5H|5.0|This is an LP worth the Bucks. There are a minimum of 3 songs that really so shine and make this LP a Keeper.  I do recommend this LP and on You-Tube some songs are used in videos - excellent i must say.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Battlestar Galactica is one of the best shows of the last 20 years. I didnt care for the original, and as such I didnt bother watching this series when it first premiered. For years I kept hearing how good it was, and finally, shortly before the 4th season started, I netflixed the first three seasons. I was totally blown away. The show is very mature scifi, by mature I mean the intelligence of the writing, it doeant talk down to its audience. The production value is amazing, each episode is like a minimovie. The show also doesnt pull any punches, its not afraid to totally shake up its characters. This is not a \\"more of the same\\" each week kind of show. The series can be enjoyed by fans of scifi, or just good drama. Ive begun watching the series again with someone who cant sit through scifi, and shes hooked on BSG.  The show looks amazing on bluray, it includes all 4 seasons, plus Razor and The Plan. I highly recommend the series.
1592536913|1.0|Hi,<br /><br />I've relied on Amazon reviews to steer me to consumer success for years.  After the purchase of this book I find myself obligated to write this, my very first review, to give back to the community I've relied on for so long.  And as such I give you an unbias, practically sound, and factually based review.<br /><br />A cohort and myself bought this book in hopes of supporting our well versed research into the world of steampunk.  We're working on our own game and supporting storyline and have purchased a few resources to further educated ourselves in any and all aspects of the genre.  We're generally laid back fellas and have appriciated every book we have purchased thus far in at least one way or another.  We're glass half full kind of guys.  I think most steampunk fans are. And it is without reservation that I must say there is not a single desirable aspect about this book.  It's not that *we* did not like this book.  But rather it is that I belive this book would benefit no one for any reason in any circumstance whatsoever.  Let me explain.<br /><br />This book literally is a compilation of 1000 pictures.  You would think this would be easy to nail.  And is why we purchased the book before any reviews were posted.  So, let me explain how and why this book did fail at something so simple.  There are no words in this book at all.  No gadget titles, no short explainations, no author references, nothing.  On each page is literally a few pictures.  That's it.  There are numerous repeated pictures meaning the title of the book is a complete lie.  To be clear, this book, entitled \\"1000 steampunk creations\\", in fact as much less than 1000 steampunk creations.  It contains numerous angles of the same creation on multiple occasions.  And quite frankly some of the angles and/or zoomed in shots are completely unnecessary.<br /><br />To be honest I think most of the initial few positive reviews for this book are likely family and friends of the \\"author\\" (the one that wrote 0 original words in this \\"book\\").  Please save yourself the cost of this book and look elsewhere for inspiration and pictures.<br /><br />Justinok\\").  Please save yourself the cost of this book and look elsewhere for inspiration and pictures.  Justin
B0055CJ8T2|4.0|GO Ms. Rowland! This album is hot!  All of the Night, Feeling Me Right Now, Lay It on Me, Work It Man and I'm Dat Chick are my favorites. I DO NOT like techno or pop/rock, electronica sounding music though. She tries to appeal to all but that was a miss for me. I think with a nice voice like that she should stick to RnB. 4 stars
B001GCUNYO|5.0|A weapon, by simple definition, is a tool used to protect one's self or others from harm.  The hero in this story is a living, breathing weapon who, in his own words, was a 'preventor' when he worked for the government in an obviously highly skilled special ops unit once the action starts.  The cost for his dedication and diligence was his family.  His wife left him and took their daughter, marrying a very wealthy business man who raises up his daughter as his little princess while the ex wife clearly allows her bitterness to show to their daughter.  So, when Neeson's character 'retires' to civilian life, all he has is a home movie of his daughter's last birthday under his roof, a single digit birthday where she gives a happy, adoring smile into the camera to show off her missing front tooth and blows out the candle on her birthday cake.  He has a single photo album in which he has a single photo from each of his daughter's subsequent birthdays until this one, her seventeenth.  He is a man who has the time to consider everything he does with purpose when it comes to his daughter and her happiness.  He keeps his distance from the ex and the new husband, but makes an effort to maintain a pleasant relationship with the man who is helping to raise his daughter in his stead. He obviously loves his daughter and she loves him, managing well enough not allow her mother's bitterness to cloud her relationship with her father, but as any teen would, she does use her mother's feelings to her advantage as we soon see.  As you watch the first few moments of the movie you get a picture of how lonely this man is, how much he sacrificed and while he does not regret that sacrifice, he does wish that he knew how to make things better, to re-establish a relationship with his daughter when she is on the cusp of adulthood and spreading her wings.  And her first act of spreading those wings is to go to Paris with her best friend to stay at the friend's cousin's home.  Now, because Neesom's character knows how ugly the real world is, he's not on board with this, especially with the way daughter and mom spring it on him the day after her birthday.  Because she is underrage they need his signature on paperwork to allow her to travel out of the country, and if Daddy doesn't approve, she can't go, so little missy turns on the water works and Daddy caves.  Unfortunately, when they arrive at the airport, he discovers that his daughter isn't going over to Paris for a simple vacation but they're following a band across Europe to attend all their concerts.  Angry at being lied to and against his better judgment, he allows his daughter to go on the trip and within an hour of the girls arriving at their destination, they are kidnapped.  His daughter happened to be away from the action with it first starts and she's on her cell phone with him, relaying what she's seeing through the window as her friend is being physically hauled out of the apartment.  His training kicks in and he's now a father and a highly trained special ops soldier and while he's telling his daughter what he needs to know in real time, he also has to tell her that there isn't going to be any way to stop her kidnapping.  The look on his face when he hears his daughter screaming for him makes you feel that moment right in the pit of your stomach and when the kidnapper picks up the cell phone after they take his daughter, he spells it out for them loud and clear:  I don't have money but I have a specific skill set.  You let my daughter go or I will hunt you down and kill you.    The bad guys think he's joking or blustering but he is serious and with the help of his old team and resources, he's on the move, heading to Paris and he starts with the creep at the airport who targeted the girls for the crew to kidnap and works his way up the foodchain.  He's been told his clock is 96 hours before he'll never be able to find his daughter and he's not wasting a second of that time playing nice or takingprisoners.  His daughter has been sold into a prostitution ring and he's not letting anyone who had any involvement in the organization off the hook.  He doesn't stop, he doesn't negotiate, he doesn't quibble, he's hunting for his daughter and every time another truly sleazy bad guy bites the dust you can't help but cheer for him.  The uncut version vs. the theatrical version is superior only in that you see him serving out the punishment these pigs deserve and it gives you a certain sense of satisfaction and justice that they don't prevail this time and they won't get a chance to victimize anyone else.  While there is a good deal of violence, it's not gory like a horror film, and there is alot of high intensity action that culminates in the rescue that you're holding your breath for.  It's a thrill ride and entertaining but it also has some clear lessons about the consequences of the choices we make.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Prequels usually don't interest me but this was excellent!  Bring out more.  I recommend you put old TV series that are finished be put on sale.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I absolutely loved the first season of Spartacus, and I wrote a review of it as well, and when I heard about the prequel 'short stack' of 6 episodes I was very much looking forward to seeing it and was not disappointed.  Because the story line of the first season was a bit complex with primary, secondary and tertiary plots and characters interracting, and it was so riveting it made you want more, it was natural to have some burning questions that went unanswered when Season 1 ended...  Like what in the world happened between Quintis and Selonius that made them such bitter enemies?  Well, you know the old saying that there is a fine line between love and hate?  In this case, it's a matter of your best friend will most definitely be your worst enemy if you have a bad enough falling out, and that's what happened between these two, big time.  There was the question about why Doctore, who was such an honorable man, was so steadfastly loyal to the house of Batiatus in the midst of this dishonorable behavior.  In the prequel, we learn about that as well about the wife that he mourned.  And, of course, the mystery of Crixus and Lucretia.  Did he at one time love her and then slowly grew disillusioned with his lot in life as her secret gladiator lover and that was why he turned his sights onto her nubile and lovely personal maid?  Well, while it seemed like a romantic notion to think about, that ain't even close to the way their relationship started.  I will say one thing, though.  As grasping and greedy, perverse and manipulative as Quintus and Lucretia were throughout Season 1 and the prequel, they had one redeeming quality between them and that was that regardless of what threatened to tear them apart, they wouldn't allow it because they genuinely loved each other.  I don't know if it was that they recognized a depth of evil in the other that complimented their own so well that they naturally meshed together, or if the two were even capable of something as fine as love, but whatever it was, they had it and they remained wholly committed to each other no matter what.  While I haven't heard any sort of scuttlebutt about the second season of the show, I do wonder if the character of Gannicus will be re-introduced into the rotation since the gladiators have fled from the house of Batiatus after the revolt, if for no other reason than to offer haven to Doctore until he can track down Ashur and give him the justice he so richly deserves.  I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1 and I was so delighted with this 'short stack' of episodes so that the questions I had about the characters and their back stories were answered.  For anyone who enjoyed season one, or who just enjoys a really gritty, intense and riveting story, this is for you.  It's wickedly good fun!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|While I enjoyed the complete first season series it was sad to realize that while I was watching I knew in reali life the main character was deceased in real life.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|As a woman who loves history, especially ancient civilizations, and who enjoyed the movie 300 for that reason and, well... *ahem* other attractions, when I heard about this series on cable I was admittedly curious.  I have never purchased any TV series before so I took the plunge with this one and while I thoroughly enjoyed it, I must admit to having been taken aback in the first episode by the nudity and the perpetualy use of particularly ugly profanity.    However, a funny thing happened on the way to maxing out my blushing fuse, I actually stopped noticing the nudity and the majority of the foul language.  Believe me, I'm no prude by any stretch of the imagination, but I do have a limit to how many times I care to hear four letter words that start with F and C before it becomes downright absurd.  The way the series is filmed is truly captivating, the blending of sets and then the CGI effects was impressive and effective.  The wardrobe for the ladies was just gorgeous as was the period jewelry that they wore, and the attire for the men was also equally impressive, though the gladiators wore loin cloths and little else, and THAT was quite all right.  The nudity and foul language were integral to the story being told, and it was told so well that you stopped noticing the bare bits bobbing about before you, and in most cases, the men and women who were nude looked very good in that state of undress.  In the fighting and training sequences, there is some viscerally intense scenes where body parts are removed from the whole and there is alot of stylized bleeding going on, but it is obvious that that part is not real.  The dialogue is fast paced and smartly written.  The plots, subplots and tertiary characters are all interesting and you feel like you're watching a chess game being played as everyone moves and positions themselves to advantage so that they'll be the winner in the end.  And in the center of it all is Spartacus, believably played by the late Andy Whitfield.  I was so sorry to hear of his passing and I watched the series again after I learned of his death, finding his performance to be spot on and noble.  Spartacus is a man who makes war and sheds blood but only because he must to survive, before and after the betrayal at the hands of the lying Legatus.  He fights so that he can find his wife who was sold into slavery at the time he was also sold as a slave.  He fights to earn coin so he can pay to buy her freedom once she's found and brought to to the household of the Dominus who keeps and trains him to fight for the crowds.  And when his wife is killed, he continues to fight to honor a man who has none, the Dominus who betrayed him and arranged for his wife's murder while lying to Spartacus' face the entire time, always moving on that chessboard to best advantage.  He fights to pay for his only friend's gambling debts and when he dies in so useless a way, he continues to fight to pay to take care of his friend's widow and young son.  He's a barbarian who is more noble and civilized than the so called high born Roman nobles who use and abuse the gladiators and those of lesser social standing.  It is a riveting series and a feast for the eyes in more ways than one, the plotting and twists keeping you on the edge wanting more.  Unfortunately, Andy Whitfield will not be able to provide since he left us at such a young age, but his work remains and it was a body of work to be proud of.  This series is well worth the investment and one of those guilty pleasures that only whets your appetite for the next season to begin.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie , which is based on a true story is quite a well done affair. The acting is top notch and oscar worthy from Claire Danes. ALthough this was a HBO movie ,she deserved and won a emmy, in fact  this one won best drama too! and five other emmys! IT's a great film that deserves every bit of it's acclaim.  The supporting cast including David Strathorn and catherine o hara  also shine and the actress who plays the mom is outstanding.<br />This movie tells a great story of someone overcoming all odds without being overly sentimental and that's a feat in itself. The direction is flawless and this captures the past quite well. The dvd is well done and the picture looks outstanding. I saw this with a high school class and they were spellbound by this one. There isn't one bad review on this one, not one, not even a three star and for good reason this is truly a quality film. It's a important one to watch , because many of us have terrible preconceptions about AUTISM and this movie goes the distance to show us that the truth is more varied than we can believe.  Of course there are low level autistics who can't interact with other people very well, I have been in a school with someone that could only recreate disney movies and never communicate in other way.  So this is the story of a higher level person but certainly it's the story of a mothers love too, because without Temples mom , she would have been locked away in a institution. A terrible fate for anyone in the 1950's much less a kid.  This is one of those movies everyone should see for a number of reasons.  Find those reasons for yourself with this winning film.  Hbo outshown the studios with this one.
B000E33W1W|5.0|Awesome movie!! Can't watch it enough!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This package is just great, all of it from the box art to the content inside. A must buy for the fans and everyone into the sci-fi or great storys should buy this saga
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have had a pair of these Sony MDR-W08L Stereo Headphones since they first came on the market. They have great sound, a long enough cord for anything I've needed, block some outside sound, and stay in your ears while active. Also, they are inexpensive. They are so lightweight & unobtrusive I forget I have them in! I have had lots of different styles up & down the price range, but I can not recommend another set more than these.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|So rarely is film let out of its cage. So scarcely is the language of movies used as though it's never been spoken before.<br /><br />Terrence Malick's fifth film is a grand victory of human awareness and stands among the greatest, most fearlessly original and most universal of all films. It explores human experience from the inside, from within its characters' thoughts and sensations. Malick identifies its protagonist as its viewer and assembles a multitude of brief impressions of astounding vividness to act as an analogue of our own collection of memories. Roger Ebert wrote of Charlie Kaufman's great 'Synecdoche New York',<br /><br />'For thousands of years, fiction made no room for characters who changed. Men felt the need for an explanation of their baffling existence, created gods, and projected onto them the solutions for their enigmas. These gods of course had to be immutable, for they stood above the foibles of men. Zeus was Zeus and Apollo was Apollo and that was that. We envisioned them on mountaintops, where they were little given to introspection. We took the situation as given, did our best, created arts that were always abstractions in the sense that they existed outside ourselves. Harold Bloom believes Shakespeare introduced the human personality into fiction. When Richard III looked in the mirror and asked himself what role he should play, and Hamlet asked the fundamental question To be, or not to be, the first shoe was dropped, and \\"Synecdoche\\" and many other works have dropped the second shoe.'<br /><br />'The Tree of Life' is an other of the greatest of these works. As the years pass, our films seem to be moving deeper and deeper inward. This film attempts to be a mirror. It shows us a life such as our own and asks us to discern what is important in a life, what is good, what is lasting; and what is meaningless noise, what does not last. Kaufman's film also explored the human experience in an unconventional way, but while it had very little compassion and was devoid of wonder, Malick's film possesses those qualities and others in rich abundance.<br /><br />One the main objects of this film is to evoke the early experiences and impressions of a human life, spanning about a decade. And one of its most masterful sections is the one dealing with the first three years or so. The many brief images and events we see delineate a landscape of early memories; we're delighted by the colorful bubbles we blow. A child with a grotesque Halloween mask. Our mother dances with us and we love her. That chair just moved by itself, didn't it? A scary dog barks at us and we stay behind our mother. A new baby, what does it do? We dream of the strange triangular room in the attic we went up in once or twice. Night after night our mother kisses us and turns out the lamp and this is the way our life passes. A glow seems to surround all things. I don't doubt nearly all of us could construct a similar sequence from our own memories (Dressing me in the morning, my father says, 'Up-a-sky!', throwing his arms upward. I raise mine in response, beaming back at him with delight - his and mine - as my night-shirt is swished off me).<br /><br />As we grow older and more aware, as the script says, 'Gradually, the subtle radiance passes from things, as though a layer of cloud had come up over the sun. Slowly as the dawn, the boy is growing up.' We begin to see bad things, sad things. Why does that man walk funny? Will our mother have to look as old as grandma does some day? Later, these things seem to be present in many places, or most. What did that man do to go to jail? Could it happen to us? Then we even find it in ourselves; we disobey our mother even though we love her, and we don't know why! We can't resist playing mean tricks on our little brother, dangerous dares. What did we do? Why aren't things the way they used to be? 'How do I get back?'<br /><br />Malick had his current style of film-making basically set since his third film, 'TheThin Red Line', but there its greatness was constrained by particularities of the project: its protagonist's wonderings did not feel genuine, its original score was unsatisfactory (my advice to film-makers: Most, to nearly all of the time, use preexisting music, or don't use any), multiple tiny roles filled by distractingly famous actors, and other problems. In his next film, the excellent 'The New World', most of those problems were absent, although, like 'Thin Red Line', it still took place within a historical event it was constrained to tell and to serve. But here Malick has broken free of all that, has no one's story to tell but his own, and applies his poetic technique with complete freedom to the life of this common suburban family (and many other things). One of the most important parts of making books or movies is knowing your subject and its details cold. Setting 'Tree of Life' in the same environment and time Malick himself grew up in, he holds all the cards here too for the first time. He soars where before he could only leap.<br /><br />I love, love, love the way Malick makes movies. He spurns artificial light, films his actors constantly (even when they don't know it), foreswears story-boards, always seeks to captivate fleeting, chance moments; a butterfly alighting on Mrs. O'Brien's hand, thunder flashing in the skies before Pocahontas, an inquisitive baby giving John Smith a kiss. He films and edits what ever and how ever he wants; what ever feels right, what ever is beautiful. He loves open fields, tall grass. He loves twilight and dusk. He loves water. He loves Sol, loves its light shining among plants, among people. He loves flocks of birds, hands holding hands, heads turned upward. He loves things that glow. He nearly always shoots manually; his camera is free. It swings and flutters about Smith and Pocahontas as they embrace. It runs joyously through a forest, peering upward and making Sol beam and dance among the branches and leaves. I am so very grateful there exists such a film-maker as him.<br /><br />Now, the degree to which there are 'good' actors and 'bad' actors is much exaggerated; actors are basically as good as the script is and the director allows or coaxes them to be. But there are actors who simply ARE the characters they play; who fit them like a glove. Brad Pitt has worked perfectly well in many roles; I should note he does not fit the over-bearing, mood-shifting Mr. O'Brien seamlessly. We're aware every moment that we're watching Brad Pitt playing this character. In a way, the softness his acting produces between himself and his often harsh character may be in keeping with the film's gentle feel. I don't know. I learn that Heath Ledger was originally intended to play the part. I think he would have been just about the perfect fit; not as bright-eyed a man as Pitt, excellent at conveying a certain muddle-mindedness. Look at his character in 'Brokeback Mountain', in which he had children too. Think of how he might have raised sons if he had been more of a family man and you pretty much have the character right there, accent and insufficient love for his wife and all. But so it goes.<br /><br />Mr. O'Brien is a remnant of a past age in which men lived by their toughness, by their ability to control, to discipline, to command. He raises his sons the way his instincts dictate him to, the way his line has succeeded. But our genes can linger far longer than the conditions which bred them, and a boy need no longer be taught in such detail how best to fight back if he is hit. 'If he blinks, crack 'im!' This generates hype and a sense of moral importance on an event which will not likely ever come (and certainly their father's attempted training sessions only disturbs the boys). In the script, driving by a team of disheveled men digging a ditch in a poor part of the town, their father advises them: 'See those people. Somebody got the upper hand with them. Don't let it happen to you. You've got to get ahead of the other guy. He'll be doing all he can to do the same to you.' And later, 'If you're good, people take advantage of you. Think of yourself as someone caught behind enemy lines. Work! Fight! I see you wasting your time -- staring out the window -- playing! I make sacrifices for you. You honor those sacrifices by what you do. That's how a family works.' His mind is every where at once, among other, worse problems. Malick describes him early in the script: 'His boys regard him warily. His sharp, sarcastic words, and orders so irrational he hardly expects that they will be obeyed. He never asks what they did at school. He does not know the names of their friends. Were he to inquire, they would suspect it was a trap.' 'He has the unshakable belief that he must approve or modify everything the children do. He is full of petty and exasperating cautions.'<br /><br />Oh dear. Sean Penn. Poor Sean Penn. He costarred in an other of the greatest films I've seen, Tim Robbins' 'Dead Man Walking', and was so perfect as Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sant's 'Milk', that I have, at times, passed pictures of the real Harvey and temporarily failed to mentally differentiate between the two men. Penn called Malick's script the most magnificent one he'd ever read (he can say that again), but was disappointed and a bit confused by the filmed result, and that his own small role ended up being essentially one of a figure rather than a character (and alas for Penn, since his first film, 'Badlands', of nearly four decades before, Malick has not made actor's films). It's true that the script was clearer about several things, especially Penn's character's existence in the city: 'The others do not meet his eyes. Each makes his way alone, shut up within himself. None can be sure of the other. No tie is fixed or lasting.' 'The supreme misery:... to find oneself abandoned to the busy dance of things which pass away.' My guess is it's one of the best things ever written, and much less a movie script than a poetic story, stunningly beautiful, unbelievably vivid in its descriptions of places and experiences. But many of its ideas would be impossible to communicate in film, and ultimately the best medium for the script, as it was in that form, was the written word. I would console him by saying the film has a power very few have ever achieved, and an effect no other has.<br /><br />The stellar accretion sequence is simply the most powerful and awesome passage of film ever made. There doesn't seem to be any beginning or end of existence, nor a smallest scale of matter, or largest. Multitudes live among the immensity of a single leg of a mite, the keys I type these words on are uneven plateaus gigamiles across. A galaxy is a twisting amoebic mote, stars are searing subatomic particles and my neighbor's welcome mat is more vast than all the wastes of Mars. I set a glass of milk on a table, and there it will stay with all the worlds it contains for a million aeons before I pick it up again, and an ocean wave is no more or less a passing shape than the Eagle Nebula. In our search through the inward planes, we now find within the realm of orbiting spheres to exist a landscape of webbed and dancing strings. This will never end. And all the matter we have perceived is a little explosion whose trifling cause we can not see, whose flying sparks will in an instant fade and turn to lifeless smoke, perhaps to be dispersed by a wind or to sink into an earth, forgotten or unseen. It does not end, it only continues. We live in infinity and eternity. But the film shows us with humbling beauty what little we know of outward realms, and of the history of the continual rearrangement of matter, and gives context of the O'Brien family's existence; the cauldron that will become their world, the microbes they will descend from.<br /><br />Some silly people inform us that Malick's acceptance of current models of the formation of the galactic realm, of Earth and its biology, conflicts with his at least semibiblical spirituality (he opens the film with scripture and refers to it a number of times, among other examples, and he is as interested in the birth of a soul as of a world), because it contradicts all that the creationists say. Malick, I'm sure, could scarcely care less about the current fancies of that endless debate. He knows that scientists do not spend their years making up malicious lies, and he also obviously feels a silent goodness in the universe. Says Jack the script: 'You whom we met in the woods and on the hills, whom first in her eyes we knew -- how shall I name you?' In 'The New World', Pocahontas speaks to it in the same fashion: 'Dear Mother, you fill the land with your beauty. You reach to the end of the world. How shall I seek you?' Around me I hear religious people confiding to each other that their god feels more present to them when they walk through woods, when they see and do beautiful things, than when reading their holy book. My mother tells me she felt this goodness touch her one night as she sat quietly holding one of her newly born children.<br /><br />Those who search eventually find the word 'god' to be an ancient verb meaning 'to call out to'. This is exactly what Malick's characters do, although they never once use the word in direct address of the presence they speak to. Kneeling at the foot of his bed, young Jack goes through his prayers as he's been taught to, but we hear his true thoughts running underneath. 'I wanna see what you see.' Malick's main characters tend to have, deep down, the advantage of a rare freedom from established theology; a freedom to directly question their gods, not only request of or thank them (I must confess I lacked this freedom at his age and didn't look beyond my considered prayers). 'You let a boy die. You let any thing happen. Why should I be good if you're not?'<br /><br />I suppose any established theistic religion tends to forget the idea of such questions, as they seem to go for ever unanswered, and focus on established assumptions. Malick, though, does a thing that few people have had the courage to do in perhaps a very, very long time by renewing those questions, insisting on them; by once more crying out to the powers that may or may not be. 'What are we to you? Answer me.' And perhaps, at times, answers are not wholely absent. Near the end of 'The New World', chasing her little son through a garden in England, feeling peace at last, Pocahontas seems to find one. 'Mother. Now I know where you live.'<br /><br />Terrence Malick is the great poet of the cinema, and 'The Tree of Life' may remain his greatest poem. It is, among so many other things, the ultimate family movie. It radiates a holiness of family, draws us closer to those we love most. The over-arching tale of 'The Tree of Life' is simple: A man is lost amid a perplexing life lacking purpose and joy. The tale opens in brokenness as he and his mother and father mourn the loss of his younger brother, the kindest and gentlest of the three sons. Seeking a way from his meaningless toil, a way back to the Eden he once knew, he lays his hand on a tree and witnesses the past and future of himself and of all existence pass before him. Jack - and we, the viewers - begin a search for meaning, for that which is lasting, holy.<br /><br />I am stunned to learn that Malick himself lost his own younger brother as a young man, for which he largely blames himself, and has borne that guilt and grief for the rest of his life. This explains so much about his films - this one above all - and the depth, meaning and power of it are made so much more profound by this knowledge. 'The Tree of Life' is the product of a tortured man, and what we see in it is not only his philosophical message, but is from his own wounded heart. His own pain is present. We are told artists must suffer for their art, and here Terrence Malick, in his anguish for his little brother he's carried since the late sixties, has made a film which stands among the greatest and most essential of all human art. Jack's vision of the after-life is also more clear in this light; what Malick shows us is not only his belief, but is deeply personally important to him. It is his consolation, his hope.<br /><br />Above all, the film is wondrous. It instills us with its wonder, its awe of all things, and helps us to better appreciate beauty and goodness when it passes before us; to hold on to it, how ever small or brief. There's a moment in the film that moves me more than film has ever before moved me. One morning, when the boys wake to find their father has gone on a trip, and they're free to romp in the house and tease their mother with a lizard and for once life is as it ought be with them, they run outside laughing with her as 'Les Baricades Misterieuses' plays, and we hear the mother's prayer for her children - for all that live. 'Help each other. Love every one. Every leaf. Every ray of light. Forgive.'he rest of his life.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is a greate series. I like it alot better than Twilight series. Love the Louisiana setting and the \\"old south\\" undertone. Listen to the song that plays at the end of each episode. I get a kick on how it relates to the episode itself.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Easy to use and great real time effects. This makes a whole new use for your camera. Could not ask for any better.
B004P8JPS6|1.0|I have read every Jack Reacher book and for the most part enjoyed them. Not so for The Affair. Couldn't wait for it to come out and then couldn't wait to get thru it. Boring and senseless. Stupid sex scenes. Waiting for trains that shake the earth, come on for heavens sake. Half the time things did not even make sense. Lee Childs can and has done better. Drop the phony sex scenes and stop over doing the descriptions of every little thing. Hope the next one is better or it will be my last.
B0024FAR5M|3.0|A watered-down peek into a potentially fascinating world. SoA has all the components of a great series and lives up to the hype for the most part, but fails to deliver the x-factor of the Sopranos or The Wire. You don't love the characters and you don't care who gets killed - even the cliffhanger is a bit of a no-brainer.  I found the story-line a bit weak and any exploration of the secondary characters was too little too late. While I still looked forward to the next episode, I ended up being disappointed with this one and probably won't be back for season two (which is probably awesome). HBO all the way from now on!
0316172324|5.0|I was at a local coffee shop which has a used book selling area.  I grabbed this one for it's simplistic look as I was in the mood for noting serious... before I knew it over an hour had past and I was completely lost in contemplation.  I am not too great at book reviews as I don't know what serious readers/authors/editors would say about this book.... but for a reader like me who takes things at face value this book was delicious.  Without trying Malcolm had me thinking about things that up until then had only been subconcious reactions and understandings about the world around me.  I grew to have a much keener mind and attitude about all things \\"Blink\\", and you will just have to read the book to know what I mean by that as it's not something easily described.  A point I can easily make here is that Malcolm describes this phenonmenon if you will with creativity, ease and a fascinated disposition.  As you read you can feel his excitement and amazement over the things he has learned, almost as though it is a treat to be telling you such wonderful and intriguing stories.    I recommend this book for anyone interested in the subtleties and grey areas of life less explored.  It will have you thinking philosophical, deep and profound thoughts within the first 5 pages.  I am truly impressed by this book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Pretty face, pretty songs. Love to hear her voice singing. It only took me 10 seconds to be captivated by this wonderful album.
6304211740|1.0|I find this version of Jane Eyre utterly pitiful.  Hurt, though a good actor, didn't quite impress as Rochester. In many moments, I didn't feel the passion/tension that define the character. Gainsbourg was ok, but she lacked the passion too, especially in the scene where she speaks all her feelings when she knows she has to leave Thornfield Hall.  The couple lacked chemistry, and what is more frustrating are the liberties the producers took while filming.  So much of the book has been left out, and worse, changed.  The Rivers didn't know who was Jane Eyre when they first met.  Futhermore, leaving no adequate description of the life changing encounter with the Rivers is just sinful.   It's truly disappointing, especially when you realise it's a Zeffirelli movie.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie is excellent. It has been performed with the highest quality and it is very accurate to the comic story line. They truly got it right and did not miss anything for accuracy of the characters' personality and powers. I am excited to see the next one.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This set is one of the largest, most detailed, most playable that Lego has ever made.  First, is it expensive?  Yes, it really is.  However, you get nearly 4,000 Lego bricks, including the best mini-fig collection ever.  Over 100 parts just in mini-figs, to the best of my knowledge that has never been done before.  You also get a set that allows you to replay every scene from the movies that was on the Death Star.  Fun to build, fun to play with, great for both kids and adults.  Much better than the display models, like 10221 Super Star Destroyer, which is nice and all, but it is just a display, it doesn't really do anything.  This set, well, talk about play options!  As for what is in the box:  First, the bags of Lego ARE numbered, so you don't have to open them all at once, it is a very straight forward build that even a 10 year old could do just fine because of the numbered bags.  The bags are placed inside white boxes, numbered 1 to 4, open them in order of course.  The manual is very nice, spiral bound, heavy duty printing, it is very high quality, looks like a $20 book all to itself.  Very large and heavy, it shows the quality of the item from the first minute you pick it up.  The Lego bricks are of course perfect as always, very nicely done.  You get lots of different elements including bricks, flats, plates, and various colors too, however there is by design a lot of gray in the floor plates.  There is some repetition in the build in the framework, however since you build it from the ground up and since the 4 \\"sides\\" are not completely the same, there is almost no 2x and 4x builds, there is just enough different to keep it interesting.  If you're a Lego fan, young or old, buy this set, it is worth every penny!!!  Note: for future reference, yes this set was $399 when it was sold by Lego, however as happens with all sets that Lego discontinues, the price will go up over time.  At the time I'm typing this, 10/10/2011, Lego still sells this on their web site, but it is out of stock here at Amazon and most other web sites like TRU.  Buy it before it ends up like 10179 Millennium Falcon did at almost $2,000.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Try sitting through the first two tracks without being moved to tears (you would need to be inhuman). The compositions are beautifully arranged and Gabriel's voice has never been stronger. Some folks are accustomed to hearing these songs a certain way, so they expect to hear them in that original form- remove the conditioning and you'll find New Blood to be a brand new experience. In an Age of Lady Goo-goo and lack of emotional substance being branded into us, it's refreshing to know that some of the greats are still out there... making music their way.
B005ELQVGW|2.0|I really am trying to listen, but Im having a hard time. Its all a mess really, I like some of the instruments and sounds but gosh its just scary. I do love the album packaging and imaging, very artistic and poetic and makes you think,,,but the music and songs, its not even tolerable. Im trying to be open minded but she sounds like a wailing seal or cat. Yet theres something that draws me to it. Basically Im very confused lol. If anyone has any help on guiding me through this musical space let me know because right now Im trying to not heave this thing out the window. I do applaud this strange creature in her efforts and originality, but its just not listenable to the everyday person at home. Its like a wild nightmare/dream where crystals hang from stars and planets fight with harps. For this she gets 5 stars but the rest, yikes.
0446547654|5.0|Very well told story of love and loss.  Nicholas Sparks at his best. I Loved it, from the reunion of the high school sweethearts torn apart by their different backgrounds to the   inevitable wrenchingly sad conclusion of their story, I was completely absorbed.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|This movie is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. Several features and clips were missing from the Theatre version. You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features.
0439023491|5.0|This was my second time through \\"Catching Fire\\" and it was equally as enthralling as it was the first time I devoured it. I don't know how I didn't drive myself crazy with a cliffhanger like Suzanne Collins wrote and the last book wasn't due out for a full year? I don't know if I've ever read a book through twice and been equally as impressed.<br /><br /> The Hunger Games have ended and Katniss and Peeta are safely back in District Twelve, living the hight life with their new houses, money, and endless food. But Katniss is shocked to learn that President Snow is watching her every move, convinced she is aimed to start an uprising. Her actions in the Games are enough to bring Snow's fist down hard and he makes her life a living hell.<br /><br /> This dystopian tale shows the dangers of a totalitarian government and submissive citizens. The government has found a way to suppress the people by keeping them longing for simple needs like food and shelter. Then, just to remind the people of their powerlessness every year they reap their most innocent citizens, children.<br /><br /> If you read \\"The Hunger Games\\" and didn't know where Suzanne Collins was left to go after the first book, much like myself, you will be both surprised and delighted.  I almost think I like the second book more than the first. This book is an absolute must read for teens and adults alike.
B005974CNA|5.0|I am just after the third time of listening to this album. Well - I must say that there are other albums of DT which I like much more. It is really great piece of music and DT keeps the high level. For me it is one of the most outstanding prog rock teams and now even after the change of the drummer (OK, Portnoy was the great personality of the band) they still have they style, character and power. For me it is not the best one of their albums however it is still great and it does not dissapoints me personally.  So I will listen to it again and again trying to find other levels of this music and in the meantime I will be waiting for their next product.
B003XVYLDU|2.0|I have heard (and read here) many good things about this book.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I did not enjoy the \\"inventive\\" style the author used to emulate the way he thinks Tralfamadorian books would be written like if they had need of books. It was irritating to read the story with the flow constantly interrupted by stanzas with tenuous relationships to one another. I imagine an author with ADHD and Alzheimer's would find this to be a comfortable writing style.<br /><br />The antiwar aspect of the book reminded me of later MASH and Archie Bunker television shows: heavy handed and preachy. A few two dimensional characters delivering the same message, over and over.<br /><br />Though it had little in the way of flow (Tralfamadorian style), I did enjoy reading the longer uninterrupted text parcels in the book. I will probably read at least one more Kurt Vonnegut book, but I hope it is better than this one.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Unfortunately I don't have a 3D TV but I saw this film when it first came out and it was in 3D. At that time I thought it was another great Pixar film....one of their best. However, seeing it again, not in 3D, was still a treat because it's such a poignant story. I'd recommend this film to anyone between the ages of 5-105.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|I personally think too many people are jumping the gun to write reviews on this album. At first, I was unsure about the album as well. As previously mentioned by another reviewer, the standard album has been up on Spin magazine's website streaming for free for the past week, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since the first day of its premiere. I'm almost sure the band took that step and slowly releasing all the songs to gain back their skeptic fan base. Once you get past the generic \\"What You Want\\" (which I still love,) and get over the disappointment that this album isn't the same old same from Evanescence it's truly soul enriching.<br /><br />It's certainly different from anything they've ever done before. It's still Evanescence, it's still Amy Lee, but you have to remember it's a different band line up behind her, and they're trying to grow as a whole. Also remember, that initially this was suppose to be an electro-pop album, but Wind-Up scrapped it, and thus you get the album you hear before you.<br /><br />There are still some dark undertones, but instead of being sad and emo-ish (which I'm not opposed to since I've been a fan of Ev since the days of the first LP and EP, Orgin, etc...) the album is more powerful. To me, with the new line up everything is more cohesive, and they feel like they're finally in a happy arrangement, and comfortable as oppose to the tension and anger you could sense before within the band.<br /><br />Keep in mind Amy isn't a one trick pony, and she's always trying to reinvent her sound to show that she's an amazing composer, singer, and songwriter. I was even intrigued by the prospect of the original electro-pop idea, and was a little disappointed to see it had been tossed because I truly believe she'd be amazing no matter what she attempted. Heck, I'd follow her straight into a solo attempt if she ever went that route, but I know Evanescence is far too important of an entity to her...<br /><br />I read one commenter on the Spin board that said she cried over Swimming Home because it had too many electronics behind it, and it didn't sound like Evanescence. I have to say - it's one of my favorites. I appreciate that artistically they went out of the norm and were willing to tinker with something they've never done before. Yes, a good portion of the album has some electronic undertones, but in this track it's definitely noticeable. Amy wanted to pay homage to the band's that inspire her like MGMT and Portishead (the latter, one of my personal favorites as well) and in this track it was certainly achieved, and Amy is fantastic on her debut with the harp.<br /><br />The songs that strike me and make my heart swell when I listen to them are My Heart is Broken, Lost in Paradise, and End of the Dream. Not to say there aren't other vocally intense songs, but these are without a doubt the most emotional songs on the album, and at points depending on my mood - the epic power behind Amy's voice on those tracks along with musical arrangements could make me cry.<br /><br />Evanescence is back. Five years in the making, but they're back. Stronger than ever. Don't be so quick to judge it, go in with and open mind, give it time to grow on you. If you're a true Evanescence fan, but are deterred by the electronics so you decide to pass up on this album (deluxe or standard) - you're making a horrible mistake. If you're still on the fence about actually spending the money to buy it: listen to it here at the Spin magazine website.

0887081770|2.0|Classic book but I was shocked when I got it and found that it is \\"pocket\\" sized. I could hardly read it and it certainly wasn't big enough to engage my two year old son. Thanks for the no hassle return Amazon!

B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan has been a family favorite since it came out.  We have three boys, who all enjoyed the music and the action (as well as the humor, Eddie Murphy's pint-size dragon being the highlight), and my wife and I have jobs in art (art teacher and graphic designer, respectively), so the adaptation of Chinese brush painting in the animation and backgrounds struck us as beautiful and wonderfully done.  A bonus for my wife is that Mulan, living and competing in a man's world, manages to become a real female hero.  She doesn't feel like a man in a woman's body, but like her own person.  In our experience, that's rare, and seldom done well in a movie, especially in a family movie.
1594488886|5.0|I received the book that I ordered.  It came well within the time specified and  it was in excellant condition.
0439813786|5.0|I already read Wonderstruck and after reading that really wanted to read the Invention of Hugo Cabret.  So, when I got this book for my birthday I was thrilled!  This was a wonderful read.  Selznick does such a wonderful job writing a story in pictures; he has a knack for bringing multiple generations of characters together to tell a wonderful mystery.<br /><br />Hugo lives in a train station.  He used to live with his uncle who winded the clocks in the station, but when his uncle disappeared he was left winding clocks on his own and hoping that no one would notice his uncle's absence and throw him out.  Hugo has a side project too; he trying to rebuild an automaton that he and his father found in the attic of a museum.  In his search for parts for his automaton he ends up involved with a bookish young girl and a bitter old toy maker.  Little does he know that the mystery behind the automaton may be wrapped up with the new people in his life.<br /><br />This was another wonderful story by Selznick.  I continue to be amazed at how well he can tell a story in pictures.  The story is told half in pictures, half in words.  The pictures are beautiful and match the tone of the story perfectly.  As with Wonderstruck, this book portrays a sense of nostalgia (it is set in Paris in the 1930's).  I love how Selznick makes the story cross multiple generations by having a young boy solve the mystery behind an older man's past.<br /><br />Although this is more of a mystery driven novel than a character driven novel you can't help but love Hugo.  Hugo is hard working and has wonderful dreams of finishing the automaton and presenting it to the rest of the world; the whole time you are really hoping that things will work out for him.  The automaton he is working on is a wonderful mystery; you can't help but desperately wonder what the automaton is going to write when Hugo finishes fixing it.  Then when he does fix it and it writes for him, what it writes creates a whole mystery all in itself.<br /><br />The story is very engaging and hard to stop reading.  I personally didn't know much about Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his movies; so it was wonderful to learn about this and makes me want to learn even more!  What a wonderful thing to dedicate a book this creative and imaginative to a film-maker who first tried to bring fantasy to the big screen.  As with Wonderstruck you can tell that Selznick did a ton of research when writing this book (he lists all of his references in the back).  You can tell this book took a lot of time and dedication to write/draw and I enjoyed every second of it.<br /><br />Overall this is just a wonderful book for all ages.  Not only does the reader get help Hugo solve a magical mystery involving automatons, they get to learn more about Paris in the 1930's, and are introduced to the movies are Georges Melies.  Readers young and old alike will find this to be a beautiful, intriguing, and creative read.  It's a glimpse into the past with a bit of mystery thrown in.  Highly recommended (as is Wonderstruck) to everyone.  I can't wait to see what Selznick comes up with next.engaging and hard to stop reading.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I was looking for a pair of headphones with a decent balanced EQ for doing some home recording. Nothing professional just amateur stuff, mostly in regards to making some beats using a MIDI controller. These things sound fantastic. As some of you might know, studio headphones can easily cost $300 up to $3,000. Now I'm sure the pros out there will definitely notice a difference between these kinds of things. But these are perfect for those who are recording at home and who are on a budget. The detachable cable is great. If you ever need to buy a new one, they run about $15 or so. Beats buying a new pair of headphones if the cable ever shorts out. Nice and long cable too. The bass sound on these is perfect. Some headphones have overwhelming bass which makes it nearly impossible to mix down a song, but these are perfect. You shouldn't really be mixing music on headphones as everyone says, but if you have no choice because you don't want to wake up your neighbors, this is the way to go. I could definitely see these being useful for musicians to play along with a click track in a more pro environment as well. Enjoy these puppies. Best in their class I'd say.

B00466HM28|4.0|I've been using the MPK Mini for a couple weeks now. It is a great MIDI controller to have on your desktop if you're limited on space or want something portable. I'm currently using Reason 5 to play some beats and I will say that it is a little difficult to get working. I had to do some Googling to find the right \\"preset\\" for the pads, keys, and knobs to work with some of the instruments in Reason. And still not all of them work correctly. I don't have much knowledge in MIDI and programming pads, so it might help if you have a bit more experience with this kind of stuff. The pads aren't the most responsive things in the world, which I think you might be able to remedy by changing sample rates and buffer sizes. You get used to the pads though. If you press them, rather than beating them, you are more likely to get in the rhythm you want while following the metronome. I tend to use the keys more than the pads that's for sure. Much better response. The pressure sensitivity can be a little annoying at times if you don't press a key hard enough. Having dynamics is great, but they definitely are sensitive. If you press a key just a little bit, it will be a soft sound, and if you press it hard, you'll get a nice loud sound. I think this is the perfect keyboard for those just starting out like myself. It is really helpful for learning how to work with MIDI. Eventually you'll want an upgrade, but there's no sense in buying expensive equipment right off the bat unless you really know what you're doing. Great job AKAI on this affordable way for people of all sorts to be creative.
B000HT3PPG|4.0|Having a mother that's in love with movies from the 30s, 40s and 50s, also living in a home where we enjoy Christmas movies all year round, I grew up with this film.  If you haven't seen this film, in short it deals with the commercialization of Christmas and with that what we tend to lose; which is even more true today. This movie is cute, charming and has an young adorable Natalie Wood(Maria from \\"West Side Story\\") in it.  Great film for all ages!
0810877228|5.0|This anthology will be excellent support for any University instructor, lecturer or professor that wants to teach this novel. Considering that many high school students were assigned the novel for reading in an English class, and have already explored the expected \\"character development/thematic representation/plot turn/underlying message\\" strategy of a typical middle to high school analysis, this book offers more sophisticated ways of teaching the book in college.  I tell my college students that I'm going to help them unpack this tried-and-true high school must-read in an entirely new way, and the essays in New Essays provide support so I can do exactly that.
B004SIP8MK|5.0|So much about this movie I love  1. Great Directing  2. The awesome Music Score  3. Great Cinematography  4. The nods to retro French and Japanese films (which we've come to love about Quentin Tarantino)  5. And the color choices all bundled into a wonderful plot of revenge.
B005BQTUVI|5.0|This director's cut of Mimic is a sight for sore eyes! The original DVD was widescreen, but not anamorphic and that made the picture suffer from that. But now, it is beyond DVD and just being anamorphic. It's blu-ray, finally!!!<br />This dark visual masterpiece looks terrific in 1080p! The detail in the image is impressive for the age of this movie. And the 7.1 DTS sound is outstanding! Just glad to see Lionsgate take the money and time to release this little film on the blu ray format. It is long overdue! And it was well worth the wait.<br />This director's cut isn't a new version by any means. It just has a few added segments and extended scenes. It doesn't really change the story or flow of the film by any means. But the few changes are good add ins.<br />Another impressive aspect is the ten dollar price tag Amazon is charging. With a price like this, what are you waiting for? Grab a copy and turn out the lights and crank up the surround sound, because this is a good ole monster movie that is really exciting!<br />Enjoy!!
1891252089|5.0|I have been working on yoga for a long time (over 30 years.) Recently I started practicing Ashtanga yoga, and picked up a DVD (by Richard Freeman [...]/ which is very good, bye the way) on the subject.  One thing I was missing though was a good book to use while practicing without the DVD.  I came across this book.  It is very good, and has different options for each pose, so that those who are not as flexible as some others are, can get through the series.  There are also great notes on breathing in the poses, which are very helpful.   Though I have quite a few books on the practice and philosophy of yoga, and have stopped buying books on the practice of the asanam (postures,) I thought this book well worth the buy.  I hope this was helpful.  All the best.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|(This is my original album review plus the deluxe stuff at the bottom.)<br /><br />Five years later Evanescence is back in a big way. This self-titled album is hands down the band's most cohesive offering--featuring Amy Lee Hartzler's trademark vocals, big guitars, soaring choruses, full orchestra backup and a faster tempo drum. While the band initially went through more lineup changes after \\"Open Door,\\" all of them (Balsamo, Hunt, McCord, McLawhorn) are back and it's clear they have all been involved in the process for this album. Instead of songs centered solely on Amy and her piano, the music is more complex and rich.<br /><br />The more up-tempo drumming and fuller sound is actually what differentiates this album musically from \\"Fallen.\\" And it's quite different from \\"Open Door\\" in that it lacks some of the experimental sounds that really put off some fans. However, while musically it's more reminiscent of \\"Fallen\\" this is not to say the band hasn't switched it up as they've added different instruments like harps and synth keyboards which really accent their sound. I do wish they had pushed themselves a little more out of the box musically though. Probably my biggest disappointment with the album though is the lack of ballads--like it or not, there is nothing more gutting than Amy singing power ballads in her haunting voice. Unfortunately, there's only like two songs that could be considered as such which is bad considering that's where Amy's at her best.<br /><br />But really the biggest difference about this album is the tone. While still firmly in the gothic hard rock category, \\"Evanescence\\" sounds much less emo and depressing than its predecessors, and instead powerful and commanding. I think it's a natural and important evolution for Evanescence (and probably means Amy is in a much better emotional state), but I can't deny that I found myself missing some of that chilling sadness found on songs like \\"Like You.\\" That's not to say that the songs aren't as emotional or never are sad (the epic \\"Lost in Paradise\\" being a prime example), just I found the album as a whole is more empowering than cathartic.<br /><br />Spin has been streaming this album for about a week now, and while I've had it continuously on repeat--I'm not sure I'm in a place yet where I can give a definitive review. It will probably take me another month to be able to do that. But for now, I can say with conviction that this album is exciting, powerful and beautiful.<br /><br />**Deluxe Version<br /><br />I was sincerely hoping that Amy would include more ballads on the deluxe version as there are hardly any on the album--but alas it is not so. Only the last song \\"Secret Door\\" is, and I'm currently not that big of a fan of it (maybe it needs to grow? as many people think it's brilliant). However, \\"Say You Will\\" is worth the price of the other extra songs combined. It's a fast kick butt and take names type of song that is simply fun to listen to.epic \\"Lost in Paradise\\" being a prime example), just I found the album as a whole is more empowering than cathartic.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|\\"Real Steel\\" is a strong movie about a man named Charlie(played by Hugh Jackman) that makes his living putting up robots to fight in various settings (boxing, wrestling, streetfighting etc.).  The robots are neither good or evil, but basically shaped by the owner's intent.  Dakota Goyo plays his 11 year old son Max who eventually becomes interested in robot-fighting as well.  Robot fighting has become such a strong influence in Charlie's life to the extent that he is met with some confrontational situations.  For example, Kevin Durand plays his archrival Ricky.  Ricky does not hesitate to aggressively confront Charlie when he wins the robot matching victories.  Ricky even boasts of the time that he \\"handled\\" Charlie to settle a gambling debt from a robot fight.  Charlie's son Max influences him to have more of a fighter spirit in all areas of his life.  In addition, Charlie's character starts to become more careful in his robot fighting dealings as the movie progresses. This is attributed to the positive influence of his son, and the stronger connection of father and son that increases as the movie progresses. \\"Real Steel\\" is best for anyone that enjoys robot action films.
B005BJ7Y54|5.0|Girls frontman Christopher Owens is a true gem in the indie rock world - not because of his back story in the Children of God, or his drug use, or his personal life, but because he's great at what he does - making songs.  Although the songs stand on their own, it's true that knowing details from Owens' life make them more interesting. For instance, he and Chet \\"JR\\" White used to play the riff from track 3 (\\"Die\\") on opiates over and over again until one of them fell asleep.  The track \\"Vomit\\" is about an ex-girlfriend and comes from a verse in Proverbs that goes \\"A fool returns to his folly like a dog to his vomit.\\"  \\"My Ma\\" is a heartfelt ballad about Owens' complicated relationship with his mother.  The closer \\"Jamie Marie\\" is a delicate dedication to a girl he left behind in Amarillo, TX when he moved to San Francisco.  Owens' honesty in songwriting is both disarming and refreshing in an era of rock that seems so eager to prove it's too cool for you.    The music is also excellent on this album.  There are really good guitar solos, well-placed backing vocals, and an affecting song progression that balances serious, lighthearted, humorous, and reverent.  The production is excellent and Owens' vocals are surprisingly good.  Regardless of how he comes across, Owens is an overachiever, and it shows through on this album.  Father, Son, Holy Ghost has a timeless appeal that will endure and may even grow long after most of the other albums of 2011 are forgotten.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|First of all, I love this series of movies, ever since the first one, but this one, oh wow! It is soooo awesome! I'm now rating this one as one of my top five favorite movies of all time. This movie is freaking awesome and it makes me drool. For one the cars, my dream car is a Nissan GTR, but one that is a little more affordable is the 2011 Dodge Charger and seeing them as police cars and also the 2012 Dodge Charger SRT-8's. I could believe it, they were awesome!<br />Now I haven't gone through all the blu-ray, but the extended edition I saw no extras scenes or notice any new parts, that I hadn't seen at the theater. If you wanted an extended edition, go get the Lord of the Rings extended editions, those were awesome, to me the longer the movie the better.<br />I am still definitely happy with the blu-ray, the movie looks great plus my fiancee can have the dvd, and with all my digital copies, I though about just putting them on my laptop and if I want to watch them on there some time I could.<br /><br />All in all the movie is great, the blu-ray is great, can't be happier!
B004MERJOK|5.0|I finished reading \\"Lone Survivor\\" in no time. I just could not put it down. I've read other soldiers' experience and some from wars past very interesting,  but this Navy Seal gives such enthralling yet poignant details. In the end I was choked up and happy at the same time. His survival skills  tells a lot of the Navy Seal's training. I am going to read this book for the third time.
0061801313|5.0|I love to read these books and it's so nice that they come in a box set so that you are able to save money rather than buying them individually. Highly reccomend. Comes with books 1-4
B005GVA2L0|4.0|(Updated)   After listen to the Album a few times now.. its grown on me. And I still believe they can produce better I have rated the Album higher...  I would recommend listening to the album a few time over to really judge.  - - - - - - - - - -  This is an ok Album by Evanescence.. But felt like it could have been more.  The songs are good but they don't jump out from each other. There just not great.  Vocals are good, and that's no surprise. Amy's voice flows well and moves nicely.  But musically is were this becomes lost. The previous records the music complimented the singing. But not here. The sound of the music doesn't feel like it changes much. The riffs feel like back fill instead of being part of the whole song. With The Fallen the music would move more. Not here, it just stays in one place, which is really to bad.
0439023521|5.0|Are you hungry for a new book to suck you in? The book, Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, will surly satisfies your need. It is about a girl, Katniss Everdeen, and her adventure through the Hunger Games. She lives in District 12 of Panem. Panem is the ruins of a place once known as North America. North America has been taken over by President Snow, a dictator. Katniss and most of the other districts suffer harshly through life. Two people, a boy and a girl, from each district every year get a chance to fight for life and food.   The two people, a boy and a girl, from each district have a chance to have lots of money and plentiful food with their families through the Hunger Games. The qualifications for the Hunger Games are that the person chosen can't be a victor of the games and has to be 12-18 years old. The winner of the Hunger Games gets to live in a great house in the Victor Village of their district. If the tributes make an alliance, the Game Makers will eventually force the tributes to break the alliance.   The 2 main characters in this book are Katniss and Peeta. They are both 16 years old and live in District 12. Katniss is courageous, kind-hearted, and is always thinking about her family and Gale, Katniss' best friend. She struggles to take care of her family on her own because her father and Gale's father died in a mine explosion. She hunts with Gale almost every day and depends on that day's haul to feed her, her sister, and her mother. Katniss likes to shoot bow `n arrows and trade her profit at the Hob, a black market.   Peeta is strong, creative, smart, and can camouflage anything. He is known as \\"Lover Boy\\" in the story. He trys to sacrifice his life for his true love. Peeta's father is a baker and was once in love with Katniss' mother. Peeta loves to paint and decorate cakes.   I have many favorite parts in this book. My most favorite part is when Peeta reviles a huge secret on air. I love this part because it changes the entire book. It gives me a new prospective of the book. Peeta's secret adds a new twist. It forces you to keep reading the Hunger Games.   As you can probably tell, I liked the book Hunger Games. I liked it because there was always something happening in the book. I felt like I was looking through Katniss' eyes through the whole story. Hunger Games had much suspense. I laughed when Katniss told me, through her thoughts, the story of when she meets Gale. I really loved the book!   The genre of the Hunger Games is science-fiction because all the story events could possibly happen. For example one day a dictator, like President Snow, could take over North America and call it Panem. The dictator could also turn North America into 12 districts. Then, the dictator could suppress its people.    A person with a sense of adventure, vivid imagination, and likes action will love this book! All people will get sucked into this book. Hunger Games is by Suzanne Collins and its publisher is Scholastic. I would suggest this book to anyone that is 11-15 years old, depending on maturity. You should read Hunger Games it will take you on an adventure.
B005U9RQNU|4.0|Anti-hero show.  Does not glorify drug use, in fact it does a pretty good job coming down hard on it.  \\"Walt\\" (Bryan Cranston from Drive, Malcolm in the middle) is an incredible actor and really nails the character.  He can handle the script, has the acting chops (who would of guessed a largely comedy actor had such drama chops) and makes his part real and gritty.    \\"Jesse\\" (Aaron Paul) actually won an Emmy Award for season 1 (I think?) so I guess they gave him a larger role in seasons 2-4.  Don't get me wrong he does an outstanding job, it's just his dialog parts too often seem longer and speech oriented, as opposed to plot development.  I found myself disengaged a couple of time throughout the season with him.   Overall, a great series about drug abuse that even points out indirectly most meth heads do not get clean (I think 3% that try have one year clean).  Violent too, though again it shows meths effect on society.

0385523904|5.0|North Korea remains one of the most mysterious and baffling nations in the world. Little information has come out of North Korea and analysts have been unable to make sense of what is going on there. To fill this vacuum Barbara Demick wrote this work of journalism.   This book attempts to shed light on the riddle of North Korea. Demick interviewed many refugees who have made it out of North Korea. This book tells the stories of five refugees. The narrative follows details of their personal lives and how they lived and survived in this terrifying nation. There is a story of one doctor who recounts her experience watching the nation's health and nutrition deteriorate. When she reaches China, she finds that the dogs in China are better fed than even doctors in North Korea. Then there is a story of a kindergarten teacher who must teach in the cold and observe less and less of her children attending school as they succumb to starvation.   Throughout the book the stories of these people are placed in the context of the times and geo-political events that changed the shape of North Korea. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the reforms of Maoist China, North Korea did not have the support and favorable trading opportunities with communist countries. Demick shows in stark detail how this affected the lives of the subjects of this book. The electricity stopped working. As the factories closed and the food imports dried up, the people went to the hills to find food. It became common to eat grass, corn husks, frogs, dogs and even rumors of cannibalism circulated.   After making the decision to escape, the refugees faced a harrowing journey across the border into China. Chinese authorities are often hostile to refugees and if they are caught they will be deported back to North Korea. When they arrive back they risk years of hard-labor and possible execution. Even when the refugees make it into South Korea, they have to start their lives anew in a strange alien culture.   This book provides a solid account of journalism. Many of the known facts about North Korea are interwoven into the structure of this book. Throughout, Demick uses good journalistic judgement in present an impartial and sourced (as much as one can source North Korea) account of life in that country. This book is an excellent introduction to North Korea. Even those already familiar with the topics of North Korea will find this to be a solid source of material.   I am giving this book 5 stars because it does everything it sets out to do. The book is not only an excellent narrative of the lives of five refugees, but it is also a great work of journalism.
B005KXT58U|5.0|If you are a long time Evanescence fan then I promise you will not be disappointed in this album at all. Even if you have never heard a single Evanescence song before you will still not be disappointed. This album is amazing. The lyrics, the music, the flow, the sound, EVERYTHING. There is a deluxe edition which includes 4 extra songs those are also just as amazing. So if you want some new tunes I advise you to pick up this album or the deluxe edition. It will be money well spent. I have listened to the album at least 100 times through already and I am still loving it.

0743297334|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is, in my view, the best of Ernest Hemingway's novels. it is full of good humor, raucous characters and interesting events.  it is upbeat and optimistic even in its downbeat moments. Unlike his later books there is none of the pending doom that foreshadows the action.  The story centers around a small group of relatively young persons who start out in Paris and then go to see the bull fights in Pamplona, Spain. They drink a lot, argue a lot, and then drink some more. it is all good fun and sometimes sad.  The dialogue is as good as it gets. If you haven't read anything by Hemingway, this is the place to start. If you have read some of his other works, but not this one, then you are missing something that should not be missed.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Picked this up on free day a week or two ago and just now having time to review... been busy playing &quot;Cut the Rope&quot;. I actually notice this staying near the top of the most popular list and just thought the name seemed corny and the pictures to juvenile. Turns out this is one of the few &quot;must have games&quot; on android and worth three times the asking price. Without going into long detail, lets just say if you don't totally enjoy this game it must just really somehow not be your thing because the quality is top notch in every respect. Basicly a puzzler at heart that starts out quit simple but ramps up the difficulty at a perfect rate. I found the first few levels of each stage to basically be training for the newly introduced game mechanic that gets tossed into each new stage, then expect a stumper every fith or sixth level to keep the pace.<br />So far there's 8 stages with 25 levels giving you 3 stars to be collected per level. That's of course a total of 600 stars at 75 per stage. It requires some thinking, patients and some trial and error to get several of the third stars but I've gotten them all and just waiting on the dev to update with some new  challenges.<br />Its good fun... Can't really go wrong for 99 cents!  Droid X2  with 2.3)

In Jack's tiny<br />world, the Bad Guy was far more evil than he could possibly know, and<br />the things that frustred him were in fact the very things that kept him<br />alive.<br />Read this book and see for yourself what life can look like through the<br />most unbelievable lenses you never could have imagined.

He is given a delicate undercover assignment following the death of a 27-year-old woman in a small town in Mississippi several times referred to as the \\"back of beyond,\\" whose major source of income is the local Army base, and whose sheriff is a stunningly beautiful woman about the same age as Reacher.  Not surprisingly, though the latter and Reacher start off as antagonists, that situation changes pretty quickly.  Reacher's background, for which fans have been clamoring for years, is finally given to them:  The circumstances surrounding his sudden departure from the armed forces which shaped everything that is to follow, much of which has been described in the fifteen previous novels in this always exciting series.  The reader immediately knows the immense pleasure of starting a new Lee Child book, and a smile spread across my face as when entering any favorite place.  The author always provides small tidbits of new information, e.g., \\"most right-handed people have left legs fractionally shorter than their right legs,' and \\"you can learn a lot from shoes,\\" and backs up these statements, of course.  Almost unexpectedly, the writing provokes smiles as much as tension, which is saying a lot.  Reacher says of a friend, \\"He fancied himself a raconteur.  And he liked background.  And context.  Deep background, and deep context.  Normally he liked to trace everything back to a seminal point just before random swirls of gas from the chartless wastes of the universe happened to get together and form the earth itself.\\"  Meticulouslyplotted, and with stunning twists, the book provides just what Reacher and Mr. Child always do:  All you need, and nothing you don't.  Highly recommended.

B004J713JW|5.0|If you like Billy Joel, You will love this.  Billy at his best.  Quality of the video is excellent, from detailed whiskers to sweat running down his face.  For a concert the sound is very good.  There are also several surprise quests I'm sure you will like. I've played this on everything from my laptop to my 55\\" big screen to my 110\\" projection system and it's a lot like being there on stage with him.  Crank up the volume, turn down the lights, and sit back and enjoy your private evening with Billy Joel and friends!  This is a must have, I may buy a second to keep on the back self for a back-up!!!!!!  This is 6 stars but the rating wouldn't go that high.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Very good rpg trader game. Friendly and attentive developers. Let me make this clear. This game is difficult as heck to learn. It has many MANY hidden variables that affect your progress. The starting professions ARE important. A player needs to keep in mind what THEY WANT TO PLAY and lvl up their captain accordingly. Without a doubt one of the best well made games I have ever seen. Initially I didn't get it very well and I kept getting my arse chewed out, (read above it is DIFFICULT).  A lot of people WILL give up before the learning curve \\"comes around\\". But if you tough it out, the complexities of the game will open your eyes to how well thought out and how many little detail 'jewels' there are.  My highest rating. 5 Stars. My only regret is that I can't give it 6 stars.
B001676320|4.0|If you like a driving Heavy Jazz Rock sound with a lot of Brass this will not disappoint.  I really enjoyed the \\"concert\\" over all but really miss Peter Cetera, the original bass player, and Terry Kath the original guitarist.  Chicago doesn't seem quite like Chicago with out those 2.  Even though Earth Wind & Fire are missing many of there original members, they have done a better overall job at keeping there sound and emotion the same over the years.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|When I first saw the trailer, I knew that it would be a great film!!! All I can say is WOW!!!! I usually dont write reviews but I had to on this one!!!!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I'm not actually a huge Gaiman fan, but the transition to film was so well done that not only did it equal the book, but it blew past it and left it in the dust.  The casting was perfect.  The writing clever.  The acting was exactly what the film required.  It took itself just serious enough for you to enjoy it and poked fun at itself in exactly the correct ways.  Hard to find a more enjoyable film in the last 20 years.
B005S7GT32|1.0|when is mr gabriel going to release a cd of new music i/o these last 2 rethreads of covers. supposedly there was enough music left over from UP for more albums. that is what i want to hear not this nonsense
0385504225|2.0|I thought it would be at least fast-paced and engaging, ala Brown's last novel.  What I found, instead, was something so devoid of believability that it was just a joke.  Come on, Dan!  You can do better!  Worry less about being so grandiose and more about being authentic.
B0002S94OS|4.0|I'm not as much into Metalcore and the other styles Lamb of God is built on, but it's still got an American Death Metal edge to it, so I definitely enjoy this album. Also, the lyrics are deceptively well written. From a critical point of view, many of Lamb of God's albums have a hard time of keeping the interest high in the later half of the album and for some reason a way to close out the album just isn't found or reached. Ashes of the Wake actually closes well, but the vibe I feel is that this is a band that from then on, will not find a different way of acheiving this. So this is why I have have a luke warm feeling about Lamb of God in general, but Ashes of the Wake is their high water mark, and if you look at their lyrical ability, abrasive sense of melody, musicianship, the successful communication of bleakness towards the listener, despite some minor short comings, it's no surprise how well liked Lamb of God is.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Does everything I need! I use a seperate radar app and I love all of the customization. I recommend this app.
B003V5PQ1E|3.0|I usually listen to my CDs on an old CD/cassette player/ radio that only displays the number of the song and the time when I'm listening to a CD. I wasn't paying attention to the little screen, and looked up every once in a while. First time I look up, it's on song 5 and I only remember two or three songs, basically. The same thing happens when I get to song 10. A lot of the songs are very short and only work together in context of the entire album, especially songs like Empty Spaces. I feel like an album should have more legitimate songs that can stand alone, rather than parts of an entire album. Yes, there are some of those songs, but I'm used to a more traditional take on an album. It's good that a band can create an album that is meant to be coherent only when played in full in today's age, when people listen to just single songs from an artist or group, but it doesn't stand up to other recent albums that I've heard (and also have a pretty good singularity that brings all of the songs together).<br /><br />I also wasn't crazy about the type of music on the CD. I loved Minutes to Midnight for a long time because of how relatable the songs are, and Hybrid Theory and Meteora from their fast-paced rap metal style that definitely matched their hateful/demeaning/whatever lyrics. Said lyrics also carried over into Minutes, but are very lacking in A Thousand Suns. Linkin Park used to be basically the negative lyrics, and that was one of the things that made them such a good band to listen to. Now they're not. A Thousand Suns is basically coming out of a very long bout of depression, and it just doesn't seem like the same band.<br /><br />The songs had a lot of special sounds and computer-generated sounds, which I understand is a LP trademark, but there was too much and not enough of the rock.  If it's a band, it needs guitar, bass, drums, and natural vocals that are sung, screamed, rapped, whatever. The more \\"normal\\" songs, such as The Catalyst, are still very different from other LP songs and just don't seem to be up to par.<br /><br />Least Favorite Songs: The mini-songs, especially Empty Spaces and the Fallout. Empty Spaces is like you're hearing a city or someplace being bombed from far-off, and at 18 seconds, what's the point of it? The Fallout is also very computer-generated and short.<br /><br />Favorite Songs: Iridescent is slower and softer (my mom actually didn't mind it when she heard it on the radio). It's definitely a new take for LP, but refreshing. Waiting for the End is probably the most similar to their old stuff, but with a bit of piano and a couple slightly slower parts. There's nothing really definitively amazing.<br /><br />Linkin Park has really changed since the rest of their stuff, and it doesn't really work fully, in my opinion. It's a bit too much of a change too quickly. If there was an album in between this and Minutes, it probably would have been better. Maybe if their sessions creating New Divide (the 2009 single) ended up becoming an entire album, things would have been better.and just don't seem to be up to par.

It helped clarify the business model we are trying to create only possible because of the thoughtful and detailed explanation of the strategic underpinning and the structure one needs to consider when executing a business according to The Experience Economy.

0446585025|5.0|This book was horrible!  No seriously... I'm just kidding.  It wasn't really horrible.  Rather, it was enlightening and funny.  DeGeneres is one of the few people who can make you laugh through a blow-by-blow of her preparation for a colonoscopy.  After the blow-by-blow she tells you the importance of regular colonoscopies.  Not only should you get one, but you should keep getting them.  Forever.  Or until you stop eating.  Or breathing.  Whichever comes first.  Her book is straight talk for anyone who can't handle the truth unless it comes on a spoonful of laughter.  Not to worry, she touches on subjects other than colonoscopies.  She'll keep you laughing while subliminally planting thoughts in your head about life, love, friends, family, and happiness and about not eating almonds in a casino.  It would be best not to read it in a place where laughter would confirm your lunacy.<br /><br />NOTE:  I requested and received a copy of this title via NetGalley.com but made no commitment to review it.

The actions, the romantic tension, the friendship, the mystery--all of it's just doubled since the last book!  Rachelle Mead is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  I can't wait to get my hands on book 4 and I doubt I will ever get tired of reading these novels.  Good thing there are 6 in the series and all of them already published!!  :)
B003ES61EE|1.0|The stem of the cleaner where the cleaning pad attaches is a very flexible material. When I try and clean a lens and put even the slightest bit of pressure on the pen it bends most of the time causing the tip to pop out of the main shaft of the pen, thus making it impossible to use. The backside with the bristles is great and gets rid of dusts very well. If only the other side functioned even half as well.

0062112430|4.0|There was definitely a lot of hype about this book and overall it was good. I've never read anything by Lauren Oliver and the premise of this book was intriguing so I gave it a try. If you're a dystopian fan then you should give this a read sometime.<br /><br />The main character, Lena, bugged me though. She was so set on getting the cure and being good, making sure not to get in trouble and living the life she believed was \\"normal\\". I understand she had a troubled past which she feared, but being so one-sided was really irritating. I've read a lot of books where the girl is naive and clueless and then has her world flipped upside down and she slowly matures and does something great. This is basically like that. Obviously, it would take a boy to change her and make her see the errors in her thinking and way of life. The love affair between her and Alex did seem kind of shallow, not really going on much before they fall in love, but he is the one to open her eyes to reality and since it is so life-changing I suppose that's the depth they share.<br /><br />Oliver's writing was good and I liked how she painted this world without love, sort of like a somber, conformist world where people are forced to believe in only one way of life. I enjoyed how she transformed love into a disease and the symptoms are so true of a person in love, I chuckled whenever it came up.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this book were the quotes and verses at the beginning of each chapter. They all related to the story in some way, but I also recognized some I've heard before and it was very cleverly placed and I could see how it played with the theme of the story. Honestly, I didn't really get into the book until the very end. It wasn't until then that I was flying through the pages to see what would happen next. The flow of the story was very slow and it took me awhile to get through the book. You definitely have to go through a lot of background story and ramblings thoughts before you get to the action-packed ending that I loved. Once I finished that last page, I was left in shock and was so upset I didn't have the second book to see what happens next.that I loved.

B005CMSDKA|4.0|Great movie! I watched this movie the first time on the DVD format but I had to have it in the blu-ray.  There was no hurry since I had seen the movie so ordering through Amazon and waiting a couple days was OK. Worth waiting for!
B005ELQVGW|3.0|Let's get straight to it; All the buzz surrounding the overall release of the album has been really good.  Biophilia's overall concept is not just about the music but also the visuals, the apps and all the technology surrounding this album.  This is a modern day way to release an album and we may start to see this from other artists.<br />This album has also been described as a great way to teach students about the solar system and as an educational tool, the accompanying apps (available in apps stores) could make learning these scientific concepts exciting and interesting.  Well darn, I wish I were a student and learning about the solar system for the first time through Bjork.  But I am not.  I'm a 31 year old Bjork fan and all I want is a good Bjork album.  Well the music itself as a whole is rather dull and it breaks my heart to say it.  There is nothing groundbreaking about it and it sounds like a rehash of Vespertine, Selmasongs and Medulla....and sadly not a rehash of the gems of those respective albums.  There are a few tracks on this album that wish they were \\"Pagan Poetry\\" but don't come anywhere as close to the genius of that song.  I just don't understand why Bjork stays in this strange folky electronic moody dark drab world.  It was groundbreaking with Vespertine but lets move forward or if she's going to copy her old work, why cant it be something from the first three albums....ugh!<br /><br />I'll split this up into three categories. The gems are the best tracks on the album but I wouldn't consider these overall career bests.  The mediocre tracks are just that, just OK!  Why she released Crystalline as the first single is beyond me.  Lastly, there are the duds and on this album the two worst tracks have the opportunity of showing up twice.<br /><br />The Gems:<br />Thunderbolt - (Bjork, I'm craving a miracle myself....that you'll put out a song I can try to sing-a-long too...ie: Triumph of a Heart, Big Time Sensuality, I Miss You, Army of Me, Violently Happy, Hyperballad, Joga...)<br />Cosmogony<br />Virus - This a major album highlight<br />Mutual Core - This is another major highlight - love the classic Bjork wailing<br />Nattura  - (This track came out almost 2 years ago - nonetheless its wonderful and really stands out when surrounded by so many duds)<br /><br />The Mediocrity:<br />Moon - Great potential/doesn't hit the mark.<br />Crystalline - Not first single material.<br /><br />The Duds - (This is that experimental stuff that some may call groundbreaking...I call it filler - 6 filler tracks on an album with 13 total tracks. Not good!)<br />Dark Matter - both versions.<br />Hollow - What is this and why do we need an additional seven minute version?<br />Sacrifice<br />Solstice)  Cosmogony  Virus - This a major album highlight  Mutual Core - This is another major highlight - love the classic Bjork wailing  Nattura  - (This track came out almost 2 years ago - nonetheless its wonderful and really stands out when surrounded by so many duds)  The Mediocrity:  Moon - Great potential/doesn't hit the mark.  Crystalline - Not first single material.  The Duds - (This is that experimental stuff that some may call groundbreaking...I call it filler - 6 filler tracks on an album with 13 total tracks. Not good!)  Dark Matter - both versions.  Hollow - What is this and why do we need an additional seven minute version?  Sacrifice  Solstice
B00466HN86|5.0|This movie is unbelievable in truth. This movie holds nothing back and brings out the biggest issue facing our society. This does not sugar coat the truth and may offend many people.  This is the first movie I felt compelled to see before it came out in DVD, I do not remember being in a movie theater since 1996, and that was nothing more than a debriefing when I left the military.  I will be at the top of the list to buy the DVD when it comes out.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Great album. I love every song on the CD and think they are very good but a few really stand out.  I love the spunk and humour of \\"Write your number on my hand\\" and \\"out of summertime\\"  But when Scotty tells a story like in \\"Old King James\\" and \\"Dirty Dishes\\" then it goes from very good to amazing. Those songs along with \\"Water Tower Town\\" and \\"Back on the ground\\" shows a depth and maturity rarely found in an 18 year old today and trancends the generation barrier.  I have been a fan of country music for +40 years and find it comforting that even when my old favorites slowly fade and pass on, a new bright light has appeared on the Country Sky.
B0058WFO06|5.0|If you want a good example of what to expect from this epic musical journey then take a look at the promo video for the song \\"Track One\\" on you-tube.  The song starts with a half whispered vocal and nylon strung guitar followed by a quirky Syd Barrett era Floyd passage, then a choir comes in before a typical Steven Wilson pull the rug out moment and it all goes to hell, with pounding drums and eeire syths painting a bleak atmosphere... however, sun does shine again with a beautiful Gilmour esque guitar solo outro.  Steven Wilson has show here an uncanny ability to draw influence from many greats of progressive Rock, like Floyd, King Crimson, Radiohead, Caravan, Jethro Tull but be tied to none and create his own unique style.  Beautiful, usettling, uplifting and powerful, frequently at the same time.  In the age of Jukeboxing and downloading Grace for Drowning comes as a real breath of rariefied air, a double album that demands your full attention and repeated listens in order to uncover all it has to offer.  Amazing.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|I use this for the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V.  The case fits perfectly, and I'm sure it fits a variety of other electronics of a similar shape and size.  It's great for what I wanted.

Also, it did not even come in a plastic case, its in a cardboard one, so the CD and DVD have no real protection and is going to be prone to getting scratched. This was actually a waste of money.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|True! This thing is a beast of all beast. I had upgraded from a Nikon Sb600 because I got into manual settings. Nothing wrong with the Sb600 but when it comes to power and speed of changing in manual mode, this thing is fast!. I wish I could get 5 more of them. I'm going to buy some more Sb600 and use this as the master flash unit for triggering. I was thinking of going wireless but the sensors on the SB's work great with just the on camera flash, so theoretically this thing should be able to set all my future Sb600 off with no problem.

B005D0RDKC|5.0|Volume 1 of the bootleg series, [[ASIN:B004I1WIZM Personal File]], documented solo home recordings from the `70s and `80s in which Johnny Cash explored a wide variety of American song. Volume 2, [[ASIN:B004GHBQOM From Memphis to Hollywood]], essayed the background of Cash's transition to country stardom via a collection of 1950s radio appearances, Sun-era demos and a deep cache of 1960s studio recordings. Volume 3 looks at Cash's role as a live performer from 1956 through 1979, including stops at the Big \\"D\\" Jamboree, the Newport Folk Festival, a USO tour of Vietnam, the White House and the Wheeling Jamboree. Among these fifty tracks, thirty-nine are previously unreleased, giving ardent Cash collectors a wealth of new material to enjoy.<br /><br />The earliest tracks, from a 1956 show in Dallas, find Cash opening with a powerful version of the 1955 B-side \\"So Doggone Lonesome\\" and introducing his then-current single on Sun, \\"I Walk the Line.\\" At the end of the three-song Dallas set you hear an audience member call out for \\"Get Rhythm\\" and the band launches into it. Cash was always a generous stage performer, early on sharing the limelight with Luther Perkins and Marshall Grant, introducing and praising them, and giving Perkins a solo spot for the instrumental \\"Perkins Boogie.\\" By 1962 the Tennessee Two had expanded to a tight trio with the addition of W.S. Holland on drums, but even with Cash's move to Columbia, the group's appearance at a Maryland hoe-down is still rootsy and raw. They rush \\"I Walk the Line\\" as if they'd had one too many pep pills, but Cash is charming as he addresses the audience and hams it up with impressions and jokes.<br /><br />Two years later at the Newport Folk Festival Cash was introduced by proto-folkie Pete Seeger. Cash is thoroughly commanding as he sings his hits and expands his palette with Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice It's Alright,\\" Pete LaFarge's \\"Ballad of Ira Hayes\\" and the Carter Family's \\"Keep on the Sunny Side.\\" His 1969 trip to Vietnam was bookended by more famous live recordings at Folsom and San Quentin prisons, but the soldiers at the Annex 14 NCO Club in Long Binh were treated to a prime performance that included June Carter on \\"Jackson,\\" \\"Long-Legged Guitar Pickin' Man\\" and \\"Daddy Sang Bass.\\" Cash continued to mix his hits (including a request for \\"Little Flat Top Box\\") with folk and country classics, mixing \\"Remember the Alamo\\" and \\"Cocaine Blues\\" into his set.<br /><br />Cash's performance at the Nixon Whitehouse in 1970 is this set's most legendary, and also its longest at twelve songs. Richard Nixon provides the introduction, including a few remarks on the safe return of Apollo 13. Cash's set includes a then-familiar mix of hits and gospel songs, but is mostly remembered for his choice not to play Nixon's requests for \\"Okie From Muskogee\\" and \\"Welfare Cadillac,\\" and instead sing \\"What is Truth,\\" \\"Man in Black\\" and \\"The Ballad of Ira Hayes,\\" the first of which is included here. Nixon is self deprecating in explaining Cash's rebuff, and Cash is deferential in addressing Nixon as \\"Mr. President,\\" leaving the political implications to seem more legend than truth. Still, Nixon couldn't have been comfortable having his antipathy towards the younger generation questioned by \\"What is Truth.\\"<br /><br />The remaining tracks collect an eclectic array of songs recorded at a number of different locations throughout the 1970s. The titles include Kris Kristofferson's \\"Sunday Morning Coming Down,\\" the 1920s standard \\"The Prisoner's Song,\\" Gene Autry's \\"That Silver Haired Daddy of Mine,\\" Steve Goodman's \\"City of New Orleans,\\" the Western classic \\"Riders in the Sky,\\" Billy Joe Shaver's \\"I'm Just an Old Chunk of Coal,\\" and several of Cash's Sun-era tunes. It's interesting to hear Cash's breadth, though not as fulfilling as the set lists elsewhere in the collection. The recording quality is good to excellent throughout, with the Newport tracks in especially crisp stereo. If you're new to Cash's catalog, start your appreciation of his performing talents with [[ASIN:B000IJ7RE0 At San Quentin]], but this is a terrific expansion (at nearly 2-1/2 hours) of the well-known, previously issued live materials.

4770031246|5.0|American Public Radio's \\"Splendid Table\\" was on the other day and there was a discussion about bento also known as obento.  Being a grandmother to picky eaters, I listened with great interest about how Japanese mothers work to make their children's lunches as appealing and fun as possible.  When I typed in \\"bento\\" on Amazon, a whole new world opened up.  The Just Bento Cookbook is great.  Even if it's just you and your significant other, there are great recipes in this cookbook -- small portions, wonderfully flavored, with easy to follow instructions.  In the back is the ever important index, a glossary of Japanese terms, web sites to visit, even a weekly meal planner.  The design of the book is appealing with photographs of each bento. Highly recommended.

I will add though, that having listened to a lot of jazz vocals, and owning a large collection of Coltrane's material, this is the CD I listen to the most - I never have become tired of it after 50+ listenings.  In fact, I have a mellow/thoughtful/romantic mood that is defined by this disk. Coltrane's playing and Hartman's singing go together so perfectly, the result is absolutely beautiful.  Also, the version of Lush Life on this CD is in my opinion the best version of the song ever performed.  If you don't have this CD in your collection, you must add it immediately, pour some wine, sit with your significant other and enjoy.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|After about five years the self titled Evanescence album finally came out. The strong guitars laced with the voice of Amy Lee make the music sore to the top of my music collection.  Would I say it is as good as Fallen? No. But with out Ben Moody this new Evanescence has quickly came into it's own sound while still holding onto the core values that makes the music sound so great.  I can't wait for the tour to come around.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This app is an excellent value. I got 39 hours of gameplay out of it before I beat it and there's still more goodies and extras after that if you keep playing after the final boss in the main storyline. I thought I'd take a few days of intensive play and beat it but it just kept going and going. Fantastic. It's got a pretty involved and flexible battle system, challenging bosses, neat weapons, items, and skills, a fun storyline, and of course, the awful translated-Japanese dialogue. Wouldn't be complete without that. It feels just like a very early Final Fantasy on the old Gameboy. Excellent work. Note that if you're having trouble with navigation by touching the screen where you want to go, you can change the navigation type in the main title menu so that you have on screen joystick and action button. This is a huge help getting in and out of the airship, as well as trying to walk up into a corner of the screen beneath the menu or map buttons. However for anyone keeping the default navigation style, know that you can swipe (press and drag) to beat those pesky corners or screen edges. That's how you keep from pressing the menu or map buttons when you need to walk under them. Great app. Lots of fun.
B003NHRIVQ|1.0|I have read the book and watched the movie... I don't like it... yet I liked the notebook, and I did like Miley Cyrus at the time she made this movie, so I wasn't a hater of her then... I just can't catch onto this movie... Actually... I kind of knew from the beginning I wouldn't like it. The only reason I went and saw it was because my friends kept ranting to me about watching it. Thankfully, I watched a library copy, so I didn't waste any money :) Smart move huh :) Anyways... I was only half into the book... Like I kind of liked the book, but it was hard to stick with, and then just went to see the movie and I hated the movie, and now can't stand the book :( Sorry Nicholas Sparks :( Movie production ruined your book for me, although was only half into it in the first place... I was really into a few other Nicholas Sparks movies/books though... \\"Nights of Rodadanthe\\" \\"The Notebook\\" \\"A Walk to Remember\\" I just don't think that this is one of the best...
0865478570|5.0|I am writing this in English, just because of a lot of incalculable contingencies that made English the language I grew up with.  There have been thousands of languages, and of the current ones, there are plenty that have literature or consumer goods that I might be interested in.  I'm bad at languages anyway, but unless I were a language genius, it would be folly to expect me to know all those languages well enough to, say, enjoy a novel in each.  So I rely on translators.  All of us rely on translators, not just for novels but for instructions on how to put that bookshelf together, or how our governments will relate to other governments.  And everybody knows that things are lost in translation, that a literal translation is the most faithful, that the translator is inherently a traitor, and plenty of other commonplaces about translation, which are commonplaces because translation is so very important to us.  David Bellos is eager to remove such clich&eacute;d thinking about translations and translators.  He directs the Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication at Princeton University, and he is a professor of French, and he has done many literary translations himself.  His book _Is That a Fish In Your Ear?  Translation and the Meaning of Everything_ (Faber and Faber, Inc.) is a series of essays about his work and the world of languages, and what translation is and is not.  It is obvious that Bellos has had a lot of intelligent fun writing about his work and that of other translators in specialties most of us never think about.  He takes particular enjoyment in killing clich&eacute;s about translation, and his book is a witty tour of the way humans get around the eternal language problem.<br /><br />So, is anything lost in translation?  Bellos dislikes the idea.  There are good translations and bad ones, but it will not do for anyone to say something is lost in translation unless that person is an expert in the language of the original and of the translation, and unless the person can specify what it is that is lost.  Here's another of Bellos's targets: Eskimos have a hundred words for snow.  \\"The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax,\\" writes Bellos, \\"was demolished many years ago, but its place in popular wisdom about language and translation remains untouched.\\"  Bellos points out that those who repeat the Eskimo story are participating in a particular 19th-century colonialist view of linguists, merchants, and philosophers that English and French and the other \\"sophisticated\\" languages of conquerors are the more advanced languages.  Sure, says the argument, Eskimos have a hundred words for the concrete item \\"snow,\\" and another tribe will have a hundred specific words for particular birds, or particular trees, but no general term for \\"snow,\\" \\"bird,\\" or \\"tree.\\"  The argument was that only advanced languages have such a capacity for abstraction, and it has been thoroughly debunked.  Being able to abstract to a larger group is no big deal, and might be a source of confusion; try, Bellos says, going into a Starbucks and saying, \\"I'd like a coffee, please.\\"  Here's another target, and you have surely heard it before: \\"A translation is no substitute for the original.\\"  You might have uttered the phrase yourself, and been credited with a degree of profundity from your auditors.  I had not thought about this one carefully before, but it is so patently untrue I am surprised anyone can spout it.  Translations are substitutes for the original.  D'oh!  That's the whole point!  There is a chapter here on simultaneous translation, one of the most exhausting things you can make your brain do.  Translating comic books is an art form to itself.  The cartoons are not re-drawn for the new language, so every bit of dialogue has to fit inside its original balloon, and the translator has little freedom (as opposed to the translator of a short story) to move any meaning to a different part of the page.  \\"If you thought translating Proust mightbe difficult,\\" says Bellos, \\"just try Ast&eacute;rix.\\"  In a chapter on machine translation, Bellos quite rightly says that a big reason computers cannot translate well is that while we can imbue in them plenty of words and word relationships, \\"nobody has figured out how to get a computer to know what a sentence is _about_.\\"  But surprisingly, he has praise for the outputs of Google Translate, which does translations in a new way.  GT figures that a sentence for translation is probably a sentence that has been used before, and translated before, so it looks for that sort of match.  Bellos reminds us, however, that this is a clever computer-engineering solution that is based on _human_ translations.  There is much here, also, about the obstacles translators must confront, such as what to do when a character in a novel speaks substandard or low-class diction.  \\"Translators shy away from giving the uncouth truly uncouth forms of language in the target text.\\"  The reason?  Translators don't want readers to think that the uncouth language is the translator's fault.  And here you will learn why Swedish detectives have adverbs after a verb to explain how they say things (\\"It doesn't matter,\\" he said calmly.\\"  It's an imprint from English translations, and is a hallmark of Swedish detective fiction, not showing up so frequently in other Swedish works.<br /><br />Bellos's sharp, amiable, and wide-ranging book isn't just about translation, it's about language and meaning and even what it is to be human.  It is very literate, and light or provocative by turns.  Anyone who uses language uses translations, and anyone who uses translations will learn plenty here.ellos, \\"just try Astérix.\\"  In a chapter on machine translation, Bellos quite rightly says that a big reason computers cannot translate well is that while we can imbue in them plenty of words and word relationships, \\"nobody has figured out how to get a computer to know what a sentence is _about_.\\"  But surprisingly, he has praise for the outputs of Google Translate, which does translations in a new way.

B005GVW05Q|3.0|Since it's not a complete washout some will call it the return to form that it's not. He threatens with sentimental balladry à la \\"29\\", but most of these eventually turn into amiable second-rate songs if you play them loud enough. His standby of changing up with an electric guitar and organ in the finale is also welcome (check \\"Do I Wait\\"). But oh how sedate he's become. Of course, heartache is his metier, only once he had the good artistic sense of dancing it away, drinking it away. Even his falsetto had more grit.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|This watch looked great on paper but the actuality was very different. The screen goes blank and the unit refuses to do anything but show a black line for a few seconds followed by a short beep. I tried the reset procedures - there are two, a partial and a full reset - neither worked. The first time this happened the watch accepted a recharge the next day and worked for a few hours before reverting to the blank screen. Looking in the Garmin forums I have found that this is a common problem that sometimes occurs right away and sometime several months later when it's too late to send it back to Amazon -then it would have to be sent to Garmin for warranty repair or replacement - which may or may not solve the problem. I'm disappointed in Garmin for this one - they usually make good stuff. I have a hand held GPS that is more than 10 years old and still works fine, another that is about 4 years old and has never had a problem, but this one was apparently never fully debugged. I'm sending it back today and have ordered a GSI watch with GPS and HRM for about a third of the price of the Garmin - we'll see how well that one works.

B00082IJ08|5.0|If you can honestly listen to the Gorrillaz, especially Demon Days, and not want to dance... check your pulse you're probably dead.  I LOVE this album.  There isn't a real way to describe the Gorrillaz besides well, it's the GORRILLAZ.  Unique and catchy tunes that have you finding your foot pounding.  I love the singles and the use of everything from rap icons(De La Soul), to a children's choir(see Dirty Harry).  This album has epic beats and monster rhymes.  From beginning to end it got me on my feet dancing, even when you hear Dennis Hopper's chilling voice come in and tell a story about mountain people... yes mountain people I still found myself grooving to the beat. Buy this album, turn up the volume, and shake it shake it!

B0052TDGQO|5.0|First I ditto what many other die-hard McCreery fans have said. Scotty is aiming to be a classic in the industry and CAD is his first solid evidence of his passion and conviction to the heart of country music. Not only does it exemplify his intentions, I feel he exceeded our expectations. These are songs with staying power. Scotty isn't concerned with knock your socks off pop and may not show at top of charts consistently for a while....but in years to come, he'll be there with George Strait and the other country icons of the industry; don't think first album could have been more true to efforts intended...esp. given the limitations of time for this first album.

B004GCKRWY|5.0|I watched this film and was not too impressed for the first hour. I was actually wondering why I bought it and was thinking of other dvds I could be watching instead. Well I stayed with it to the end and wow what a film. The dvd case says things like 'Thrilling', etc., but I was not impressed... at first. There is a critical point in the film (the twist)where you find out what is going on and then it hits you. It is from that point that I could relate to it. Now I've never been in a box before against my will but the symbolism here is what we can all relate to.... and who hasn't been done this way by someone before? You think everything is good and then you find out what the real deal is.  Points:  (1) Movie is within the confines of what looks like a coffin but is more like a large box of some kind  (2) If you have issues with being in closed-in spaces, then this film will give you problems  (3) STAY WITH IT til the end

B000AJIF4E|4.0|I just got these and they are as described.  Very good sound quality.<br /><br />The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the packaging.  Hey, Sony ever hear about the environment and recycling?  The packaging is largely made up of an over-the-top selection of plastic that can not be recycled (including some fake silk stuff I just do not get).  How about you redesign the package so these excellent headphones stand on their own and are not just one more thing added to the local landfill?

0131480057|5.0|Of the dozens of computer/technical books I've read over the years, this is one of the most readable. Not just well written but also well edited. So many technical books are quickly slapped together and full of typos or clunky structure. This book really flows. Especially appreciated the extra time they took to consistently point out for every subject the subtle differences between solaris, hp-ux, aix, linux.   A great choice if you're just getting started with enterprise system administration.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|Having seen Advent Children when it originally came out, I always found the plot rather jumbled and confusing.  I also thought a good chunk of the music sounded too heavy metalish.  Advent Children Complete corrects the majority of those two issues.  There's new scenes added in that flesh the story out a bit more and make it clearer what's going on.  However, since those scenes are new to Blu-Ray, they stand out from the original scenes due to them being significantly crisper and sharper.  The soundtrack too is almost completely different.  Numerous tracks have been toned down a bit or remixed.  Though the special features are largely the same as on the DVD, I would recommend picking this up even if you already own it on DVD.  The added scenes make it a better film.  Still won't make sense to non-Final Fantasy VII fans though.
0425241505|3.0|I wish I could say I loved this book as much as other reviewers.  Taken as an action oriented paranormal romance, it was great.  The plot moved at a nice pace, and I never felt bored with the story. The world was interesting. The characterization is where this story lost me.  It's an odd personal quirk of mine that I need likeable characters in my fiction.  I need to care about my protagonist, their romance options, and even my antagonists if I'm going to enjoy a story.<br /><br />And I DID love the main character.  Pia is strong, smart, and capable.  She's also balanced in a way man urban fantasy chics are not - she doesn't mouth off without cause, or \\"shoot first ask questions later.\\"  She will give you the harsher side of her wit if you piss her off.  She's honorable - the kind of girl that would steal from a dragon, but leave an apology note and a replacement item as recompense.  I loved her.<br /><br />What I did not love was Dragos.  I had absolutely no sense of him - who he was, what his motivations were.  He was about as real to me as card board with a \\"Alpha Male\\" label tacked on.  He's the kind of guy that yells, rages, and bruises you before he makes sweet sweet love to you.  Hot right?  Ya, not so much.  I like a good possessive alpha male as much as any girl that enjoys romance.  But I like to feel that under all that bluster is a real man, with feelings, and reasons for being the way he is.  Reasons I can understand, and even sympathize with.  The only thing I thing I was given to help me understand Dragos is, he's old.  Yup, massively old - like before the dawn of time old.  Now I know that'd make a guy a little ... errr... different than the norm, and I really tried to understand him from that perspective, but I just couldn't.  He's an enigma to me, and didn't think he deserved Pia.<br /><br />Dragon Bound, was fun read.  The action flowed nicely from start to finish.  I liked the world, the main character, and even the side characters.  I just did not like Dragos and that threw off the whole romance plotline for me.  If you are the type of reader that enjoys a good action, and steamy romance, but places less emphasis on being able to empthize with your progonists, I am confident you'll love this book.rew off the whole romance plotline for me.

B005DWBZZE|5.0|That Daniil Trifonov is a young, staggeringly brilliant pianist is an established fact. His recordings that are available on both MP3 and CD are magnificent, but this recording has something special. The CD is taken from two live performances - in both the Teatro la Fenice in Venice and in the Fazioli Hall in nearby Sacile, Italy.  The recorded sound is vibrant and the atmosphere is pulsatile.<br /><br />Trifonov offers some of the 'big' works for piano not available on other recordings - the Grand Valse Brillante in E flat major and the Andante Spianato et Grande Polonaise Brillante both from the Venice concert. With these pieces he performed the Rondo  \\"a la Mazur\\" in F major and the Etude in F major. From the concert hall in Sacile he adds Mazurkas #33 in B major, #34 in C major, and #35 in C minor form Opus 56 and concludes with the Sonata No. 3 in B minor, op 58.<br /><br />To comment that the performances are dazzling would be an understatement. But it is the knowledge that these Chopin masterworks are played in live performances where there cannot be engineering feats to enhance the recording brings the flavor of Trifonov's sense of architecture which for this listener is unmatched among the many gifted pianists of today who are also playing this repertoire.  This is  a very special recording and one that some persistence in obtaining will be well rewarded.  Grady Harp, October 11
0439023521|5.0|This series is by far my favorite of any YA novels I've read, and I've read a lot. And although it's considered YA any age will enjoy this action packed, romance filled, amazing debut novel! Buy all these books at once because once you start you won't be able to stop; I read all three in one day! This one is my favorite of the series because of all the interaction between Peeta and Katniss. I promise you won't regret buying these books. This is what YA writers should aspire to create.
0345522478|4.0|I'm not sure if I liked the book or the narrator better.  In my experience it is not easy for a male to do female voices.  Lots of times they get overplayed.  But Luke Daniels in this unabridged production of Hounded does an excellent job of portraying all of the characters.  His characters appear to be understated which counteracts that somewhat overblown plot involving a 2100 year old druid, his Irish Wolf hound, a coven of Polish witches, a pack of werewolves, a vampire, and assorted Celtic gods and goddesses.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan, the above mentioned Druid, has made a peaceable life for himself in Arizona where he owns a small shop selling herbal teas and books on mystic subjects.  Then one day the Morrigan in her battle crow shape blows into his shop and things quickly become a lot less peaceable.  Atticus had in the distant past earned the undying enmity of Angus Og the celtic god of Love (don't think Cupid) when Atticus manages to make off with a magic sword that Angus Og himself wanted.  Now Angus is making a major push to get it back-- as well as create a conflict among the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about the narrator was his ability to use the sometimes tongue twisting names of the characters with a confidence that made me feel that he was doing it correctly even if he wasn't.  Actually, from my experience reading books from the Celtic revival of the late 19th and 20th century, he was doing pretty good with the Celtic ones.<br /><br />It took me long enough to getting around to listening to this one, but I'm definitely going to pick up the other two [[ASIN:0345522494 Hexed]] and [[ASIN:0345522486 Hammered]] both available from Audible read by Luke Daniels.

I think we, as parents, are all looking for ways to help our children with science and technology. So much of our children's success is tied to a strong science based education. This book sets the stage, opens the mind, and makes science fun. A wonderful perspective.

B005FFW46S|2.0|I have been a fan of the Discworld novels ever since finding Equal Rites at my local library back in the very early 90's.  Since that time I have collected and on some occasions replaced every book in the series as well as Strata, Johnny and Dead, Diggers, and one of my all time favorites Good Omens.  That is why it almost breaks my heart to write this review.<br />This novel, much as the last one in the series (Unseen Acidemicals), just does not have the same subtle humor.  The characters are all here, yet they are almost unrecognizable.  Poor Wilikins suffering the worst.<br />From the beginning the reader is constantly reminding of specific details over and over again.  The jokes are base, and frequently not only allude to adult themes, but spell them out.  Typically I have no issue with this, but as a long time follower of all things Discworld I know for a fact that Sir Pratchett has never needed to use it.  He has always been able to weave more meaning into one phrase, description of a scene, or characters thought then most authors achieved in a chapter.  Half the fun of reading the novels is in what he leaves out.<br />Reading Snuff reminds me of watching the new Star Wars movies for the first time, I kept thinking it will get better, it will get better.  And then it ended.  I know McMillian will keep publishing these until Terry Pratchett stops writing them, but I think it is time for his editors and fans to tell him that maybe now is a good time to call it a day.  Maybe not on the high note he hoped for, but before it becomes any worse.<br />A lot of you may not like this review, I know.  I don't want to go into too much detail because many people will buy this book, but go back and read Jingo, Small Gods, and come back and read this.
B001TKK3O8|2.0|This movie was suspenseful and seemed to keep my attention on it but the ending just did not seem to fit well.  Since in my opinion an ending can make or break a movie, it in my opinion it really broke this movie.  I believe the extra features contain an alternative ending but it did not differ much from the original.  I am not a big Anthony Hopkins fan but really played his role well here.  Maybe a more appropriate ending could have made this movie really good.  If you like movies with suspense then check-it out since some people might find the ending ok.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

B004HWT6DO|2.0|Despite what you've been told, this film isn't in the same league as films like 'Out of Africa,' 'The English Patient,' or 'Apocalypse Now.'  The first scene sets the stage quite well.  It reminds me of trying to watch an episode of 'Gilmore Girls'.....non stop, machine gun paced, witty remarks, snarky shots, and clever banter.  But, it's just so robotic, there really isn't any human element at all; it's empty.  Jesse Eisenberg does a fine Jesse Eisenberg, which is a shorter version of Michael Sera.  Timberlake has some appeal early on, but it quickly fades and you question why he continues to be in the story.  I did enjoy the portrayal of the Winklevoss twins and their little buddy; they were a bright spot in the movie.  Overall all I don't think this film posseses any depth or substance, in acting or cinematography.  It's a flash bang grenade of Gen Y pop culture and superficiality that I didn't find very interesting.

0736092269|5.0|This book has great reviews so i won't go into the contents about this book. However i will comment on the most frequent negative (suggested improvement point) comments from the other reviewers.   1. This book doesn't fully explain form of the exercises described -  Well its not supposed to! It however shows starting and ending positions and does talk about different grips. It does offer some suggestions on posture and variations on positions/grips which i found very informative. It also shows you exactly what muscles are targeted when performing the exercise in the mentioned positions/grip/posture.   2. Doesn't contain enough exercises for each body part - Are you kidding me! The book contains exercises that current pros use (Read Robert Keneddy's Encylopedia of Bodybuilding to see routines of the pros if you don't believe me). There are enough exercises in here. I'm sure future editions will contain more exercises.   It also contains good advice on how to avoid injury which i found extremely useful.   To get the most out of this book, use it as a reference guide along with either Arnold's or Robert Kennedy's bodybuilding books. Given that it shows exactly what muscles are being employed in different types of exercise, one can use that knowledge and experiment with low weights at the gym to hit the specific muscle and feel the pump!
B005GVA2L0|4.0|If there's anything to be certain of by now, it is that Amy Lee is a brilliant writer, singer, and marketer. She knows that the surprise factor that launched her first album to historic levels (Grammy Award winning, mega-selling, etc.) and pushed her second album to acceptable levels, isn't available anymore on the third go-around. Part 3's are always tough. So what does she do? She creates a third album that consists of singular, Evanescence sounding, rich, thick songs and are above all, very radio capable in every instance. If you're an Evanescence fan as I am, you will really enjoy this album. I almost gave this album a 5 star, but I do miss the gothic, mysterious and sometimes spacey atmosphere that her first and second albums took me to. I understand though and give Amy mega credit. To counter this aspect, she has assembled a group of very talented musicians to back her beautiful and amazing voice. The band is as tight as ever and very impressive. So is the depth she puts in many of the songs. Strings, harmonies, deep striking rumbling riffs and rhythms made me want to listen to it again and when I finish this review, again. Well done Amy and here's to your mega-money maker. It's well deserved beauty!
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Ryan Adams had spent his career putting out material like clockwork until 2009 when he decided to take a break from music. I was stunned to say the least. Cardinology had just been released to a mixed reaction from fans who were unsure of his new direction. Foggy, the Ryan Adams Blog, had been as busy as ever with acoustic Cardinology songs and demos for the ultimately shelved Dear Impossible. Suddenly everything came to a screeching halt. The lifestyle he had embrassed for the past decade was being quickly put behind using his newfound sobriety and marriage with Mandy Moore. The tour with the Cardinals had been cut short and he had officially stepped back from music.   Adams has now spent the last year dedicated to releasing previously recorded material, III/IV and Orion. He also seemed to be spending a fair amount of time recording various sessions of music. These various sessions left many of us eagerly anticipating a new album. Make no mistake though, gone are the days of Adams releasing quantity over quality. This was not an album that would end of being shelved or rushed out into the market.   Ashes & Fire is a whole other animal from Ryan Adams. This is a tightly produced album, thanks to Glyn Johns, that contains some of the most fleshed out tunes of Adams career. Immediately you can see the benefit of having keyboardist Benmont Tench, who's playing flows effortlessly along with the soothing acoustic guitar. Adams vocals have never sounded better. Norah Jones backup vocals, which I felt were a bit overbearing on JCN, are angelic. The album opens with Dirty Rain. This wonderful tune packs a punch many thought he couldn't deliver anymore and is my personal favorite. He quickly follows this up with what many will consider the best song of the album in the fast paced title track. This song will surely remind some of you of his younger days. The album continues with the tranquil tunes Come Home and Rocks, which are as heartfelt and honest as anything the man hasdone before. Do I Wait is possibly the most intense track on the album teeming of desperation and yearning. This is perfeclty followed by the uplifting and hopeful Chains of Love. The album continues with a string of beautiful hits, most notably Invisible Riverside and Kindness, that showcase how strong the album is as a whole.   Obviously some will be disappointed because Adams didn't simply re-record Heartbreaker or Cold Roses. The album can be a bit sentimental at times which could also be off-putting to some. That being said, I feel as if Adams has earned the right to exhibit songs that show just how content he is. The big difference with Ashes & Fire is that there is no excess baggage that needed to be trimmed during production. This is 11 songs that feel like they belong together. Every song adds to the experience and was obviously treated with as much love as possible in the studio. Enjoy this beautiful record which is one of the best, if not best, of Ryan Adams career.
1400032717|3.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is an interesting and enjoyable read. The best adjective to describe Mark Haddon's writing here is clever. The perspective of the autistic child is clever, although I'm not sure it feels entirely authentic. The puzzles and illustrations that take the reader through the inner workings of the protagonist's mind are clever. Numbering the chapters with only prime numbers is clever.<br /><br />The difficulty with this kind of protagonist is showing character growth for the main character, and I found it difficult to tell how much Christoper was developing, or not developing. Either way I would have liked it to be clearer.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Curious Case is worth reading, enjoyable and clever, despite having some limitations dealing with an unconventional protagonist.<br /><br />Trev @ [...]

B003Y74AZ2|2.0|There's really not that much to be said about this case. It's a very, very basic case.. Getting the phone into it is simple, as the silicone is very, very malleable (too malleable).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Simple design, Apple logo visible (if that's your thing), all buttons/ports easily accessible.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Far too .... squishy. In tight pockets the case can easily come off to a certain degree. It's also quite unattractive around the screen since the case isn't rigid but very floppy in its lines.<br /><br />Overall, it's not expensive, but it's also not very good either. I'd save your money for a case that's a bit more protective and solid.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|This is a pretty nice case as far as cases go! It's a little tricky to get the iPhone 4 into it as it's a more solid, rubbery material, but once it's in it's not coming out by mistake, which is always a good thing!<br /><br />All ports and buttons are accessible without any awkwardness, which is always good!<br /><br />There are really only three minor cons that I have with this case:<br /><br />1.) The concentric circles are definitely a love or hate thing.. I personally don't mind them (I guess it's a love or hate or don't-mind-them thing, then!).<br />2.) On a black iPhone, the clear color is a little distracting to me around the screen.<br />3.) The back of the case picks up hairline scratches VERY easily, but it's a case and designed to protect your iPhone, so maybe that's forgiven?<br /><br />Overall, a solid AmazonBasics case!

B003ZTQN1I|3.0|I LOVED the movie and the songs in the movie so thought this would be a good purchase. I was wrong. I actually ended up skipping through most of the tracks on the CD to get to the few I liked. Also, I was disappointed with the remade versions of \\"Give into Me\\" and \\"Stronger\\", these were two of my favorite songs from the movie and the remade versions just weren't as good. The few songs I did like though, were really great, which is why I still gave this a 3-star rating.

B004LUS390|5.0|as a graffiti  artist and working on being. character designer this app is amazing I use the bug version on the computer with a wacom cintique amd on a phone with a stylus for the evo 3d its really usefull for practicing small post parts such as eyes, ears, hands feet. on mg Toshiba Thrive table and again using a stylus the sketchbook version is 5.99 and it woo was well worth the Money with that I practice mid shots, or face renders, and sometime i just sketch by observation. and most important my graffiti. just fyi. I don't do graffiti as in vandalism. but on paper I'm a mural style but useing grafifi techniques.   Anyways i recommend this to anyone who has a good phone that has 2.2 and up. hopefully 2.3 for better performance. amd anyone who has an android tablet as well I recommend gettin that version as well. its a great tool for practice. and for touch screen there are stylus's out there for phones for this exact purpose although they can bs used for anything.   in the end. buy it if you haven't. amd if you have a tablet buy that version as well. amd if you have the $1,000+  well that's how I paid when i gotit before I could get a discount.) to buy it for a computer, pc or mac. then do that as well. you can transfer your files from one device to another and maintain your layers.
0547391005|5.0|I am very happy with the purchase of this book. It has all the Curious George stories and my daughter is obsessed with George. The only problem is that the book is rather heavy and difficult to hold when we are laying down in bed for a naptime story.

0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus is a very whimsical and magical book, almost every detail ties together perfectly in the end. The story follows two magicians in a competition Celia and Marco. Then there is another story that begins many years after Celia and Marcos story of boy named Bailey and two years in his life when the circus came to his town. Slowly the two stories going back and forth between the two intersect nicely at the very end.<br /><br />The Night Circus also pulls at the beginning of each new section describing a part of the circus as if you yourself are actually there enjoy the circus. It brings in the circus smells and atmosphere so nicely that you can easily imagine that you are at this magical circus yourself.<br /><br />Some characters are more enjoyable to read about than others. Celia seems so distance and static but Marco seems to have more qualities and determinations. Each character has there part in this book and everything has a meaning in the end. I almost feel like I have to reread it at the end to understand things that had happened at the beginning.
159420229X|4.0|I decided to read this book thinking it's a self-help book about improving memory after I heard about the author winning the memory championships, while I came to know in the first few pages that it wasn't the case it got me more curious to read further as I progressed more. It covers the importance of memory in daily lives the fact that we don't acknowledge this even though we use it over and over again will be reiterated in the first four chapters which looks at people who have incredible memories to people who can only just remember the last few minutes of their lives. The books covers also how people become experts in their fields and what is really being an expert mean? Which again attributes to use of memory? It does cover a few but very important techniques used by memory experts to win memory championships, all of this mind bending story telling is all done in a well to read format with interest going throughout the book. The only critique I have with the author is when explaining the possibility of savants also using memory techniques he uses a so called savant and reveals his name while he is still claiming to be one who got his powers from an epileptic seizure he suffered as child, while I think the basic argument holds good and most likely the savant is a phony guy still naming him in a non-controversial nonfiction book is a little out of the line. But still the book is exceptional in every way and would make you look memory in a totally new way.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Having never bought either ICO or SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS for the PlayStation 2, but having heard glowing reviews for both, I figured that this HD collection would be a great introduction to the Team Ico series. I am coming to these games as a person who has never played either one, and have only within the past year or so become familiar with them. For a first-time player, this collection is a great title.  ICO  This is a puzzle-platformer with a distinct sense of isolation and an artful atmosphere. From the opening sequence to the actual start of gameplay, I was intrigued, though not outright \\"sold\\" on the game. The story is simple: Ico is alone in a strange castle on an isolated island with only one other companion, a girl named Yorda. Neither of them speak the other's language, so they have to work together using gestures and simple intonation to make it through the castle's traps and puzzles. Only Ico can accomplish puzzles requiring strength and ingenuity, and you need Yorda to open doors and save the game.  The gameplay is very straightforward, with a simple button scheme (of which, excluding the analog sticks, you'll use five of most of all) and very simple combat. The puzzles can be absolute head-scratchers, and some require a rest and restart the next day before they make sense. There are a few I had to go and look at a walkthrough for, in fact, although I managed to figure many of them out on my own. Great puzzles and simple controls make this a game that can be played by just about anyone.  The music is minimalist, from a Zelda-like tune during the saving process to an ominous, simple rhythm for when enemies are around. The ambient sound effects include eagles and other forest-dwelling birds, crackling torches, rushing water, and rustling trees. The graphics have the slightly dated look of the PS2 era, but they shine in 720p nonetheless, with such touches as dynamic lighting and bloom effects. As I never played the original PS2 version, I can't comment onthe graphical increase, but I can say that this game is a good way to test your television setup.  The camera, unfortunately, is where ICO suffers the most: it sits at fixed locations which can only be minimally adjusted by the player and has led to a lot of cheap deaths for myself, some of which could have been negated by full camera control. There is a key difference between \\"cinematic\\" and \\"practical\\", and unfortunately ICO doesn't bother to mesh the two. Poor camera locations have also caused confusion with objects and textures, as it makes it very difficult to see around pillars and other objects. I did get used to it after a time, but the camera never stops being annoying in all the wrong places. A lack of save points and checkpoints led to even more cheap deaths, unfortunately, which at times forced me to replay large sections. As of right now, I have not finished the game, though I am about two-thirds of the way through it and know how it ends, which seems to me to be enough to review the game.  Overall, ICO is a nice addition and was great for the first hour and a half, but after that, I stopped enjoying the game as much as it started to feel long. It is, though, worth playing - others will most likely have less difficulty with the game than I did. Also, this is the EUROPEAN/PAL version of the game remastered for NTSC-region PlayStation 3 consoles, so there are some changes in puzzles and camera angles, as well as some additional bonuses, from the original (going off of what the wiki and other people have said).  SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS  This is where Team Ico shines in this collection. Instead of being a purely puzzle-platformer, this an open-world adventure game with some puzzle and platforming elements. You play as Wander, a young man who comes to the Forbidden Lands through the only entry, a massive bridge spanning half the width of the Lands, to a shrine where he makes a pact with an ancient supernatural force to bring a girl, Mono, back to life. LikeICO, the story is minimalist, but unlike ICO, it grows into something bigger and more epic at the end. Your only companion is Agro, Wander's horse, whom you will use to cross the Lands with speed and agility, as well as defeat certain colossi and reach certain areas.  The gameplay in SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS is a lot of fun and requires some imagination and creativity. The massive world and impressive draw distance, such as being able to see save points from miles away, makes it difficult not to get sidetracked. There are white-tailed lizards to hunt for increased stamina, fruits to shoot down from trees for increased health, hawks to hang onto and fish to ride, as well as nooks and crannies and incredible sights to take in. From a shadowy forest to a massive waterfall to an underground temple, the sights of the Forbidden Lands are absolutely incredible to behold. There's lots of things like moss and trees to climb, while fighting the colossi can be anywhere from relaxing to epic to frustrating.  The music in the game is minimalist, reserved for fights against the colossi, their introductory sequences, their death sequences, and certain cutscenes. With a few exceptions, all the music is wonderful, with \\"Silence\\" and \\"Revived Power\\" being standout tracks. Sound effects include rushing water, rustling trees, hawks crying, and the sound of wind, the pitch of which changes depending on whether you're in a cavern or out in the open.  The controls for the game are great, and once I got used to holding the R1 button to hang on to things, it turned out to be a very intuitive and unique control scheme with some shades of ICO in it. On Normal difficulty, it is very difficult to die, and thankfully there's a large number of save points to use all across the map.  Overall, SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS is the best addition to the collection. The camera, graphics, sound, gameplay, and story all work together to create a unique, emotional, artful journey that asks a lot of questions, manyof which can only be answered with your own convictions and beliefs. I am currently over halfway through my second playthrough and am going to start a playthrough in Hard mode - a good indicator of the quality of this game. I was a bit concerned that, as a Japanese game, it would embrace the occultic influences. Instead, it does the opposite, ending the story with the reason why the Forbidden Lands are forbidden in the first place almost explicitly stated. This is honestly one of the first and probably only games that has taken this stance on the supernatural, and I am very pleased with it.  EXTRAS  - The cover art can be reversed to have SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS's original artwork and ICO's original European artwork facing outward rather than the \\"HD collection\\" artwork.  - The collection includes two dynamic XMB themes, one for ICO and one for SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS.  - Also on the disc are five videos, mostly dealing with the two games already on the disc. While the cover says that there is a peek at THE LAST GUARDIAN included, I have yet to locate it.  - ICO includes the European bonuses, such as two-player, an additional extended ending scene, and extra hidden weapons.  THE ICO AND SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS COLLECTION is a wonderful addition to anyone's PS3 library, although ICO has its drawbacks that take the collection down from five stars to four in my opinion. It's worth picking up, but maybe not at the full price. If in doubt, rent it first.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I got this product on time. It was brand new as stated and in perfect condition.  I would buy again from this vendor.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|Spoiler alert!!  This is one of the best shows on television (along with Dexter) - really makes me wonder why I continue to waste my money on horrible box-office drek when some of the best and most engaging work is being done on TV.  From the entirely plausible premise of the first episode to this breath-taking season finale, I have found myself continually identifying with \\"Walter White\\" (Bryan Cranston's best work - ever) - a decent man faced with increasingly horrifying choices who simply wants to provide for and protect his family - and finds he will take any steps necessary to do so.  Riveting performances from the superb cast, all the way through, and a fantastically satisfying conclusion (where will they go from here)?  Walter White's last words - \\"I won\\" - followed by the slow pan across his yard to the flower-pot (and unlike others, I did NOT see that coming) revealing just how determined to win he actually was, gave me chills.  Also not to be overlooked are the darkly clever episode titles, with this last episode's -\\"Face Off\\" - being most appropriate.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|I too have one of the defective ones, and I'm debating the hassle of sending it back (though Amazon returns are pretty painless).  Haven't used it in the field yet, just around the house.  Doesn't look like it will hold up to a lot of rough handling due to the plastic construction....but I did mount my 7D/Tamron 17-55/f 2.8 to the base, and added a Lilliput 7\\" monitor via small friction arm to the hot shoe up top, and weaved around with it.  Also tried walking around with my Canon Vixia HV30....I thought it did much better with the heavier DSLR/Monitor set up in terms of shot stability.  Well worth owning for this price, IF you don't receive a defective unit.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Outstanding, stupendous, one of a kind movie!a great comedy.  I received the product from Amazon exactly when it was promised to arrive and the quality is terrific.  I laugh harder each and every time I watch it.

B005LAJ1CC|5.0|\\"Here comes the sun....the smile's returning to their faces.\\" -- George Harrison, 1969<br /><br />\\"I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say.\\" -- George Harrison, 1966<br /><br />This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited!  As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time.  Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching.  This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.<br /><br />I've said all along that George was all about love.  From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this \\"new little Harrison,\\" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love.  Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children.  George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people \\"love one another.\\"<br /><br />This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry.  George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.<br /><br />George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary.  George's sister, also named Louise has banged on the drum for her brother for many years.  In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.<br /><br />Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting.  It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old.  In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression.  His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.<br /><br />Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the \\"real world\\" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty.  George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.<br /><br />George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan.  His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois.  He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait.  His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French.  George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.<br /><br />George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time.  It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young.  It was a trait that never left him.  George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up.  From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.!  Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he andGeorge inherited their maternal grandfather's tall, lean frame.  Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George.  You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary.  Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him.  Louise definitely left her stamp on George!  Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)<br /><br />Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969.  It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.<br /><br />Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way.  She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing.  Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all.  Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born.  Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.<br /><br />Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001.  I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video.  The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.<br /><br />George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many.  I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism.  She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite.  This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker.  Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles.  She would let George \\"talk\\" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across.  This later segued into richer, developed speech.  As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.<br /><br />George's humor comes through time and again.  His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: \\"well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys.\\"  He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way.  George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song \\"The Inner Light.\\"  He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.<br /><br />A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music.  George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like \\"Dear One\\" are beautiful prayers set to  music for our prayer meetings, Bible studes and discussion groups.  George is, as we say \\"a parishioner by proxy\\" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.<br /><br />Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.<br /><br />You will also want to read [[ASIN:1889899054 Before He Was Fab : George Harrison's First American Visit]], which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise.er.

0802714544|5.0|There was a time when we spied on the Soviets, they spied on us and the writers who wrote spy fiction liked it that way.  In the height of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall stood as more the a physical barrier.  It split a city and two contrasting life styles, each living in well reasoned fear that the opposition was trying to wipe it off the face of the earth.  These were simpler times, an easy to be a spy novelist like John le Carre, a master of writing about the craft of spying.  Gist for the mill jumped off headlines in major metropolitan dailies and out of Joseph McCarthy inebriated mind.    In the hands of a good story teller, a master spy could reasonably navigate his way through Moscow without drawing more attention than a single match stick in a generic and unmarked book.  But, these days, trying to have an American go incognito in Damascus would be like try to slip vodka into James Bonds's martini.  You are just going to set off some alarm bells.  From the spy novel perspective, the new world order doesn't lend itself to the kind of deception we appreciate.  la Carre, like many of the old masters, has struggled in this new world.  In his newer work, he makes good movie but lame novels.    But, it's still a good time to read his early stuff, when spies were spies and the Soviets weren't trying to be like us.  His leading man are lumpy and flawed, never to be played by Sean Connery or Clive Owen. Instead, think of Ricky Gervais, if he took a serious turn, or Phillip Seymour Hoffman, though like a good spy he can do anything so it's not really fair to cite him, but you get the picture.  In the Spy Who Came in from the Cold, la Carre's breakout novel, the leading figure is old, fatigued and miserable.  Alec Leamas spent a life lying to his closest associates, mistrusting the motives of others and wearing a secret face, leaving him alone and in cold comfort as his usefulness as an agent comes to an end.  Packed with this emotional wreckage, Leamas accepts one moreassignment before he can come in from the cold to finish a career that has ended sourly.    It's impossible to do the plot justice without spoiling the novel's conclusion, but there is a reason Time Magazine rated it one of the top novels of all time and Publisher's Weekly called it the greatest spy novel ever.  As with many great novels, sometimes a great plot and strong story telling can obscure a deeper message.  So it is with The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  la Carre has a lot say about the morality of spying, why we do it, who it benefits and who it hurts. His characters, presented as archetypes, are fully fleshed with quirks and humanity. There are no cardboard cutouts here.  No short cuts in character development.  Yet, in each character we see more than a person, we see a class of people, or should see it anyway and the whole package paints an ugly picture.  The Cold War is gone.  We won that one without firing a shot, through as a result we have the greatest and most expensive military in the world.  The military, like la Carre's early spy novels, may be bit dated, built for a world left behind and unmissed, but that does not mean that we can't admire the majesty and the power.
B001JFZ118|5.0|Since first watching Highlander in the mid nineteen-eighties much has been released on the theme. I rate this film as the best of them all still. It is a fantasy drama of love and loss, and good against evil that is set firmly with the choice of the individual over anything else.  It is violent and it is emotionally provocative in reference to the journey of Connor MacLeod, the main character, from his birth in the Middle Ages in Scotland to the present day, albeit almost thirty years ago now. He is immortal hence his longevity, one of a number of immortals born throughout history around the globe. They are magical creatures and must battle one another with swords until only one remains. The Prize is what they are driven to fight for, yet the true nature of this reward is not revealed to them.  Two or so hours in one movie was never long enough to do the story complete justice but it was popular enough for two sequels and other slants the franchise took in terms of television and animation.  Forgive me for saying this, but for me in the end there can be only one, and that is the original Highlander movie. This Director's Cut version, no pun intended I'm sure, is faithful to the original release of the film and may well end up being the definitive version in time, though at only six minutes of extra footage it is possibly not for anyone other than the die hard fan. If you are buying the movie for the first time then you may as well go for it.

There are plenty of books, web sites and friends out there with techniques and home made recipes that cover everything in this book. Need advice about curly hair? Make friends with folks with curly hair! And please, don't represent yourself as a white woman who invented natural curl care!
B005IS565S|5.0|It has been quite some time since I have been motivated to buy a cd.  Usually I just get select songs off iTunes, Amazon, etc.  After hearing a few of the tracks on Octane, I decided to bite the bullet and spend 10 bucks on the album.    I have listened to the album 2 times now and I am very happy with my purchase.  Some of my personal favorites include:  American Capitalist, Under and Over it, The Pride, and Back For More.  Honestly, every song is pretty damn good.    Bottom line is if you enjoy good heavy music, this album delivers.

B005IEF27O|2.0|I've been a fan for almost 20 years. I can't say I was anxiously waiting for Primus to come back to tell you the truth. The material on their \\"Animals\\" recording was for the most part forgettable, just like Les' solo stuff during the last decade. This album is no different. Besides \\"Moron TV\\" I don't think there's a song on this that makes me smile. It's actually kind of boring. It's not horrible but it's VERY disappointing. It's uninspired work (you've got several songs about TV and pointless consumption- and you name the album green naugahyde? Are you even paying attention to what you're writing, Les?). That's especially obvious when you listen to material that you've heard before (Tragedy's a'Comin' is Ballad of Bodacious, Jilly's on Smack is an upbeat tempo version of Mary the Ice Cube). If you are an old or new Primus fan, and feel you need to listen to Claypools other stuff, you can't go wrong with Oysterhead. It's the best thing Les has done since early Primus. It's an album you can listen to from front to back. Even \\"Highball with the Devil\\" and \\"Purple Onion\\" have more enjoyable tracks that are more Primus-like than  what you'll hear on Green Naugahyde. Don't make the same mistake I did- skip it. This album gets a 2.5 from me.

B00000G3I2|5.0|I don't know what the director and screenwriters had in mind when they made this movie, but if nothing else they did a great job exposing late 1960's and early 1970's \\"radicals\\" as nothing but a bunch of narcissists.  \\"Oh what happened to us?\\" the characters in this movie moan.  \\"I was at my best when I was with you all\\"--when going to demonstrations and whatnot.  This movie makes it very clear what happened to these people.  They were self-centered egotists then and they are self-centered egotists now (the now of the movie being 15 years later)--and complete phonies to boot!  The only difference is that their posturing has worn thin over the years.  Jeff Goldbloom has a great line in this movie that illustrates this point.  He poses the question as to what is more essential, sex or rationalization.  He ends his discussion of this topic with the question \\"Have you ever gone a week without rationalizing?\\"
B005GVW05Q|5.0|I love Ryan Adams, and you need to know that up front.  That said, I've been a little let down by Easy Tiger, which I loved at first, but which has not stayed in my CD player as much as say Cold Roses (probably his masterpiece!) or the somewhat misunderstood genius of 29.  I was worried that this CD could be a return to more Easy Tiger style stuff, which was good but not very memorable.  I am so pleased to be wrong.  Dirty Rain, the first track, starts us off on an easy midtempo folky song with a great melody and a fantastic vocal, full of the passion and grit that we've missed a little recently.  You've probably heard Ashes & Fire by now if you are a Ryan Adams fan, and it is a good one.  I haven't heard him use the waltz beat very much, and he uses it well.  The vocal on \\"Kindness\\" is absolutely transcendent, it reminds me of the best vocals from Cold Roses, and the use of the organ subtly in the background is very welcome.  I love the piano touches, which are not overboard, and I love his gentle drawl.  I love this song, and for me it is probably the standout of the record.  Fans of alt-country Ryan (as opposed to Rock N Roll Ryan, Heavy Prog Metal Ryan, English 80's Pop Ryan, Rap Ryan, Death Metal Ryan, or any of the other incarnations that he inhabits with remarkable facility) will find much to enjoy.  For me, his voice--by turns gentle, trembling, cracked, gritty, and melodic sounds fantastic here.  Ryan does a lot of styles well, but this is the style at which he is the acknowledged master, and this set of music will make those who love his heartbroken tales of woe and love gone wrong very very pleased that they have continued to listen.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Anyone who doesn't get or like this movie has no true sense of humor. I admit, the beginning is a tad dry, but once the aquarium hits the road, its mesmerizing, funny and I mean laugh out loud, crying funny...Johny Depp is great as the lead and its a very fast paced, active movie that you do have to pay attention to, or watch a couple of times. This was a hit for a reason...I LOVE this movie!!

B004LWZVZC|4.0|Being a Civil War historian and an Abraham Lincoln fan, there is little I have not already read about the Lincoln assassination conspiracy plot.  While Robert Redford does a masterful job of producing an aesthetically pleasing piece of film making, it would have been nice if his version of fantasy concerning Mary Surratt's complicity in the conspiracy would have been based on the facts that are readily available to us all.  I understand that Redford's intent was to leave the viewer with the opportunity to make up their own mind as to Mary Surratt's guilt but to paint her as the sympathetic widow who was nothing more than an innocent by-stander takes Redford's credibility to task.  Maybe he was taking into account that many who might watch this film are not history buffs or do not know much about the assassination conspiracy?  Mary Surratt was a VERY involved participant in the planning of the 1864 kidnap plot and in the subsequent assassination plan.  She could have turned the participants in to the Federal authorities at any time but yet she chose not to.  Of course, this would have meant turning in her own son, John Surratt, Jr. as well, who was John Wilkes Booth's right-hand man.  As Andrew Johnson remarked, \\"She kept the nest that hatched the egg\\" referring to the boarding house that Mary kept on H Street in Washington, D.C. where the conspirators frequently met to plan their heinous plot.  As to Mary being tried by a military tribunal as opposed to a civilian trial, what she and the others did was an act of war against the United States as the Civil War was still going on, although in its final stages.  They were Southerners who were upset at Lincoln's reelection in 1864 and General Lee's surrender to General Grant at Appomattox Court House days earlier.  By targeting the President, Vice President, and Secretary of War for assassination, they were attempting to decapitate the Federal government.  They were not entitled to a civilian trial any more than the 9/11 terrorists would have been.  Watch this movie for entertainment value only and then read \\"American Brutus\\" or \\"Blood on the Moon\\" for an accurate and honest account of the Lincoln assassination conspiracy plot.terrorists would have been.

1594202710|2.0|A Primary focus of this book is the interaction between Chinese and American leaders since the PRC was founded in 1949. `On China' runs through four generations of Chinese leaders, Kissinger has used these leaders and their diplomacy as primary sources in writing this book.   I think Kissinger's representation of China as a self-absorbed exceptionalist powers borders on offensive. He over-uses the term `barbarians' in describing what the Chinese leaders nicknamed every other nations leaders. You must keep in mind that Kissinger is a machiavellian and prominent supporter of realism. Therefore, this book must be read from the standpoint of an American realist...\\"the ends justify the means\\".  His views are delivered in a way which makes the United States seem `on top of everything', `always in charge' and sometimes even `victims' in this Sino-US relationship. The book lacks any major WW1, WW2 or Vietnam references. One of the biggest mistakes is that Kissinger tried to understand ancient Chinese history, this is a bit embarrassing. This is NOT a book about China, this is a book about the diplomatic relationship between China and the United States from the 60s-80s, nothing more.  Although, I did enjoy Kissinger's occasional input of comedy;  \\"Mao set the tone of the next day's meeting by receiving Khrushchev not in a ceremonial room but in his swimming pool. Khrushchev, who could not swim, was obliged to wear water wings. The two statesmen conversed while swimming, with the interpreters following them up and down the side of the pool. Khrushchev would later complain: \\"It was Mao's way of putting himself in an advantageous position. Well, I got sick of it. . . . I crawled out, sat on the edge, and dangled my legs in the pool. Now I was on top and he was swimming below.\\"

Edward Norton's intensity is entrancing as he conjures up spirits while the inspector tries to figure out how he does it. An excellent old fashioned movie that puts plot and substance ahead of special effects.

B005U9RQNU|5.0|I don't know whether this is the final season of Breaking Bad, but it is The best one of any television drama in quite some time. Actually the last 3 episodes were the best in any show this year. Usually final, or season-ending, episodes are anti-climactic and rather predictable. This was not. To some extent there are some obvious plot points by the ending was worth the price of admission and then some. Cranston should get another Emmy nomination from this, and the show should get one for Best Drama.

B005D0RDKC|4.0|This is the third in the \\"Bootleg\\" series of Cash Recordings.  Unlike the first two volumes, this consists entirely of live recordings, all fairly rare to rare, over a 23 year span, and most all of them (37 of 53 tracks) unreleased until now, from 1956 through 1979.  There's 70 and 76 minutes of music, per disc, approximately in this set.  The sound varies from location and year, but is okay to good.  Similar to Vol. Two, this set is in a standard double jewel case.  The 20 page booklet lists details of each concert, and contains an overview of Cash and this music by Dave Marsh.  There's also a number of period b&w  and color photographs.  This set shows Cash's development as a performer, from his earliest concerts, on through to relative superstar status, to Cash becoming a figurehead of \\"American\\" music.  Accompanying him is his wife, June Carter Cash, and a group of fine musicians.<br /><br />Beginning, on Disc One with recordings from the \\"Big 'D' Jamboree\\" in 1956, with great renditions of \\"I Walk The Line\\", \\"and \\"Get Rhythm\\" (especially), Cash shows that even early on he was a warm, honest performer.  These early tracks are good examples of Cash's early performance style-straightforward and honest.<br /><br />Tracks from the \\"New River Ranch\\", in 1962, contain standouts like \\"I Still Miss Someone\\", \\"Cotton Fields\\", \\"Perkins Boogie\\" (named after guitarist Luther Perkins), and \\"The Rebel\\".  These are more good examples of Cash connecting with people in his no nonsense, plain, singing style.<br /><br />The songs from the Newport Folk Festival show Cash in a slightly different mode.  Here he performs tunes from across a broad stylistic range, but plays acoustic guitar, and without a drummer.  Good versions of \\"Big River\\", \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"the old folk/skiffle tune \\"Rock Island Line\\" (made popular by Lonnie Donegan), Dylan's \\"Don't Think It's Alright\\", and going way back to the Carter Family era with \\"Keep On The Sunnyside\\".<br /><br />Many people don't know (or have forgotten) that Cash paid a visit to U.S. soldiers in Southeast Asia, at the height of that war in 1969.  Among some fine songs are \\"Cocaine Blues\\", \\"Jackson\\", and \\"Ring Of Fire\\".  While everyone will have their favorites, being of \\"Vietnam age\\", these tunes, especially, ring with special feeling and authenticity.<br /><br />Disc Two is about half filled with songs from Cash's performance in Washington, D.C., at The White House, in 1970, with an introduction by then President Richard Nixon.  Even in this setting, Cash performs some fine songs like \\"Wreck Of The Old 97\\", \\"Jesus Was A Carpenter\\", \\"(There'll Be) Piece In The Valley (For Me)\\", and \\"Were You There (When They Crucified My Lord)\\".  The tracks from Osteraker Prison in 1972 have Cash backed by a small, simple band to good effect.  The two tracks under the heading \\"The Carter Fold\\" hark back to an earlier era with piano backing.  The rest of the disc show Cash's style changing some, but still connected to his roots from his earlier days, with \\"City Of New Orleans\\" (from a CBS convention in 1973), \\"One Piece At A Time\\" (from Hiltons, Virginia in 1976), \\"Give My Love To Rose\\" (from the Wheeling Jamboree in 1976), and \\"I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal\\" (from the Exit Inn in 1979), by Billy Joe Shaver, who has released a number of fine albums.  These tracks still show Cash as a fine interpreter and performer in the 1970's.<br /><br />Together with June Carter Cash (who adds much with her vocals) and his fine band (and even family members), Cash proved on stage his ability to connect with the \\"everyman\\".  His songs speak to hard times, some good times, and to the time in the hereafter.  He had the ability to speak about life in terms everyone could relate to.  The various styles of songs found in this collection show Cash as a master performer, but more than that, he was a treasure house of American music.<br /><br />For anyone wanting a broad look at Johnny Cash on stage, this set will do nicely.  This collection can sit alongside his other notable live releases, with it's true, honest, straightforward interpretations and traditions of life.  Cash never forgot where he came from, and his early years made a lasting impression on him.  He was a proud but humble man with the spirit of America running though himself and his music.  And in these songs, from his early days into the '70's, we have many fine performances from a true American singer who was in touch with the traditions and spirit in all of us.rue, honest, straightforward interpretations and traditions of life.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is my favorite show on TV right now. Seasons 1-3 are masterpieces and I thought S4 would be no less than amazing. Season 4 started off with a bang by having the scene where Gus shows us how truly monstrous he really is.  I admit, for much of the season the show got a bit slow. But the last episodes certainly make up for the earlier slowness of the show. And the very last episode has one of the most epic scenes in the entire series (won't spoil it here but I'll just say that Gus has gotten what he deserves). This season seems to be more about tension and suspense for most of the season rather than action and it really delivers because my heart was beating quite fast in quite a few moments this past season.  Like past seasons the acting by the entire cast is awesome. Cranston and Paul continue to shine in their roles as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman and deserve the awards they have received so far. Giancarlo Esposito is amazing as Gus and is one of my favorite TV villains ever (he really needs to at least be nominated for best supporting actor). And, of course, every other cast member are perfect in their roles as well.  The people that create the DVDs and Blu-Rays have been awesome at making the DVDs/Blu-Rays better with more audio commentaries as each season is released. I hope there is an audio commentary on every episode for Season 4....I cannot wait to hear the commentaries on some of the episodes!!  Overall, these last episodes have saved the season and kept it on par with the past three seasons and I cannot wait for season 5!
0062011847|5.0|Snuff, the latest Discworld novel, returns focus to Sam Vimes, commander of the Night Watch and one of Pratchett's longest running protagonists.  In Snuff, Vimes finally takes a vacation, going to the countryside with his family.  Out of his element and without his customary support, his policing instincts lead him to smuggling, river piracy, murder, and even some crimes against goblins that aren't even against the law -yet-.  Still, Vimes ensures that justice is done.<br /><br />Terry Pratchett is rightly famous, and his fans will definitely want to read this book.  There are some interesting developments.  While still full of humor and wit, Snuff felt somewhat more mature or serious.  A new race of goblins is added, and a goblin recruited into the Watch.  In a shock that no Discworld fan will want to miss, Nobbs-of-the-dubious-race gets a girlfriend (well, sorta).  An incredibly fun read, easily up to Pratchett's usual standard but with enough development and difference to appeal to the most jaded Discworld reader, Snuff should make a killing.

B005GVA2L0|1.0|Unfortunately, this isn't being offered as a download--yet. I wonder if they will be so kind as to include the bonus tracks. However, by the looks of Amy Lee's thighs I think she has been sitting on her laurels too long. Bands like Within Temptation, Sirenia, and Lacuna Coil have barreled their way to the forefront of gothic metal. I don't think a new band lineup is going to matter. From what I have listened to, I'm not impressed. I found the production week and the songs clich&eacute; at best. I think I will save my money, particularly with the DVD. I don't really need to watch another Youtube video on the making of another song while they spend their time trying hide Amy's behind those extended hemlines. Better luck next time. I give them one star for showing up to work.

B005NPBTQ6|5.0|Granted, I've reached the point where I would buy anything that Ryan Adams releases. However, I haven't bought into III/IV yet and don't know if I will. Regardless, there is no denying that Adams is a chameleon of sorts. I think if anything disgusts me, it's that people still confuse him with Ryan Adams. Please!<br /><br />Regardless, I think we all have our favorite Ryan Adams CDs. Mine may well be Demolition, but I have been overtly pleased with everything I have of his as well as Whiskeytown. That being said, I think most people will find this recording toned down compared to previous releases. However, that is not to say that this is a bad CD, simply more laced back and quite frankly--smoother.<br /><br />I keep coming back to the track Kindness and Dirty Rain. I expect either to be the first single. Still, all the tracks are very easy going and it's actually a nice surprise. Some of Adam's more mellower or soul-searching tracks have been my favorites of his. This is the kind of music you can simply kick back to and chill; the more I listen to it the more I love it.<br /><br />Have no fear, judging by Adams eclectic atmospheric releases, his next one will probably knock our sonic socks off. This one will probably get garner him some more Dylan comparisons. However, Ryan Adams has more than come into his own and this is simply another facet. I have to say that the CD is musically consistent and surprisingly humble.  It may well go down as one of Adams' more memorable releases.
0525422943|5.0|I read Gayle Forman's first book,  If I Stay, earlier this year... and it has stayed with me over the past few months. It's a touching story of life, love, and the grief that comes when you are left behind. So here I should issue a warning that if you have not read the first book in the series, reading this review will definitely reveal some SPOILERS for you. MAJOR SPOILERS. Okay, take a breath and here we go!   Where She Went takes place a few years after the first book, after Mia has gone to school in New York and Adam has made it famous as a rock star. After being separated for that time, their lives intersect for one night in New York. Secondary to losing Mia, Adam lost all joy in life, despite his apparent success. Reading from Adam's perspective is so compelling, and your heart breaks for him as you read his story. You follow him through the loss and pain after the accident with Mia's family, through her recovery and his life without her, and finally to the moment when they come together and face everything between them. My review? I love this book. I read it in under four hours, and was completely consumed by the world that exists around Mia and Adam. These books are so beautiful, and draw the reader in so completely, that I feel like giving a copy to everyone I know. They're written for a young adult audience, but deal with such complex issues that I am confident readers of all ages will find something to love.

0345529057|5.0|This book set was a wonderful buy, the price itself sells the whole thing... The books are standard (thin) paperback, and held up during my (and my friend) reading them. Box makes it easy to keep them in neat order, and the set looks nice enough on my shelf.
0893860220|5.0|Are you asking the question why you are here? Are you looking for meaning in your life? Of course you are, otherwise you would not be reading this now. In my hectic living, such questions continued to appear and eventually I was obliged to pay attention. Nisargadatta Maharaj was one of the first I stumbled upon, not only with the answers but the key for opening much deeper questioning. In this context enlightenment can be seen as a journey, a journey out of the madness of our own creation to a clearer space. During that time, Nisargadatta'a work 'I AM THAT' was my constant companion, the transcendental consciousness beckoning to the cognitive within enabling the dissolution of self. I deeply acknowledge all who have participated in bringing his message to the world.  [[ASIN:B000RT48TS You are the World]]
B005NA3B8U|5.0|I played this back on the gameboy.  I was glad to see it.  I believe it is actually quite well made and adapted for the phone.  worth it.
0062060554|2.0|I admit I have a higher standard of scale when I am reading books that attempt to do big things. They get judged a lot more harshly than books that just attempt to be.  This one attempted great things and failed.   To begin, I have to admit I was annoyed reading the entire book all the way through, probably through no fault of the author, but from some moron at the publishing company who decided to go through and edit all the British speak and Americanize it. I presume this was an editor decision not the authors as the book says he lives in London, and so I presume he knows how they speak there. I am an American, but I have Brit friends and read quite a bit of their writings so I know how British should sound, and when I am reading a book that's supposed to be a journal and it sounds like it was written by your average American I get really annoyed. It takes me out of the plot and world and each inaccurate word is a shred on my nerves.  Cell phone instead of mobile, sweater instead of jumper, sidewalk instead of pavement, on and on... every page filled with Americanisms, each one going shrick, shrick, shrick against my brain and jumping me out of the world that the author is trying to create.    Then there is the fact that I absolutely hate loathe and despise plots of contrivance and convenience with a pat ending that is completely ludicrous.  The chain of events that had to occur for the \\"plot\\" to have worked, coupled with the trite ending made me want to wrench my eyeballs out.   ****SPOILERS BELOW!!!!******************  So in order for this plan to have worked there are some conveniences that absolutely defy description that have to have occurred. Let's start with the obvious:  1. Her son decides not to bother to even check up on her for months.  Okay, he lives an hour away by train.  He doesn't even call Waring House to ask the nurses how's she doing?  Not ONCE in half a year?  Okay fine.  So he's a total butt who completely ignores his mother's existence for months on end, fair enough, she can't remember him, what's the big deal.  But then oh, such a nice pat trite happy ending of him coming to swoop her up and they will live happily ever after.  Okay.  Whatever.  Sure.   2.  This woman is such hot stuff when she is young that not only does her psychopathic lover decide he can't live without her 20 years later and concocts some random kidnapping TWENTY YEARS LATER, but her dear devoted cuckolded husband loves her 20 years after the fact also even though she's a mental shrub and wants to spend the rest of his life with her now (even though he conveniently abandoned her six months prior and gives Psycho boy a shot at her) and even though, like her son, he couldn't be arsed to call and check on her for months?  But now, oh it's all different, happily will I devote myself forever more.    3.  Then there's the doctor.  This one was HILARIOUS.  So we have a doctor, who treats people suffering from memory problems....AND HE RELIES ON THEM TO GET ALL THEIR BACKSTORY.  WHAT????????????  Well you told me this had occurred, so I assumed it had, you told me this occurred so I reinforced it.  Where did he get his degree ACME U?  I also realize that the author needed to create an element of suspense in the ending a \\"will she or won't she remember\\" scenario, but using the doctor to instill doubt is just completely in direct opposition to how he'd set this character up. Prior, he's all woo-hoo over the most minor success, now she tells him she can independently remember things and he's all \\"sad eyed\\" and cautionary?  Bad and schizo characterization.   4.  The journal.  So many things wrong with the journal concept.  From the sheer impracticality of her being able to handwrite dozens and dozens of pages a night, to the fact that it doesn't actually read like a journal but a novel, all these things ...annoying.  But the one that absolutely freaking kills me is:  every day this journal is brand new to her and she DOESN'T NOTICE THE REMOVEDPAGES.  When something is new, you examine it. If the removed pages are evident when she looks at them with the removed pages in hand, then they would have been JUST as evident when she's looking over that journal that morning \\"for the first time\\".  The psych doesn't notice the removed pages???  Come on. Just really. COME ON.  Sorry, this book blows.  I'd have given it one star but I am feeling generous.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Ok it was a great movie, very interesting and such.   This is a very intersting movie and I liked it.
B004EPZ08E|1.0|Great movie.  Hilarious movie.  But DO NOT BUY THE DIGITAL COPY VERSION unless you DO NOT WANT TO WATCH IT ON APPLE MOBILE DEVICES.  That's right...you cannot download it to iTunes to transfer to iPod, iPad, or more.  It's a joke, plain and simple.  Horrible.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|great movie, I didn't know that there were attornies that worked from their cars.  Wish I could have a car like the lincoln.
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|Worst ever director's cut I've ever watched.  If I could return this movie I would.  I want the theater version!!!  The director's cut made this out to be some sad Disney disaster...I have no clue why the director wanted Mia Sara singing...and the music?  Holy cow - sappy and awful.  The theater version is soooo much better...was much more appropriate to the \\"dark\\" versus \\"light\\" nature of the film.  I love this film and I was so excited to actually buy a DVD copy but quite frankly, I'm throwing it out.  I'll go in search of the theater version so I can have the original.  The editing, the music, the story...everything fell into line.
1933492953|4.0|The boldness of the drawings in this book amazes me every time I pick it up. To put this statement into context, I'm a professional storyboard artist, but my own work pales in comparison. Yes, this is a bit of a pun because I work in pencil and a couple of shades of grey wash, whereas the artists in this book work in ink...lots and lots of it. While these are nominally storyboards, almost every frame could be separately framed, hung on a wall, and enjoyed as a unique piece of art. The artists featured in this book are at the top of their craft.
B005S7GT32|2.0|Artists get into dangerous territory when they take a perfect song and mess with it much. There are some songs you just don't cover because if you can't improve upon it, whatever you do looks pale against the original.<br /><br />The only person I've heard who covered their own songs with orchestration and did it brilliantly is Joni Mitchell. She managed to actually increase the feeling in the remake. But not so here. It kinda feels like Peter found a new toy and wanted to show off with it.<br /><br />Take \\"In Your Eyes\\": while the lead-in to the chorus is interesting musically, the verses are drained of the life in them. John Cusack wouldn't have held this song above his head trying to win Ione Skye's heart.<br /><br />The Rhythm of the Heat feels rushed and lacks the incredible soulfulness of the original.<br /><br />On the other hand, Mercy Street and Red Rain are well done, but I don't think they rise above the song being covered.<br /><br />Darkness is the only song that feels improved.<br /><br />I'm left to wonder: why not write new songs for orchestration?
B004WKOCP8|4.0|Yes, upon first listen, I gave this album 2.5 stars, with Isadore being the best song by far. But this album has grown on me with each listen. Now, I must say that I love it. It's different then their prior stuff but what would you expect - them to sound exactly as they did 15 years ago? Come on. Great album!
0525423281|4.0|Cute story. Liked Anna and the French Kiss better. Glad Anna and Etienne made this book. This story dragged a bit for me for the first half. Unusual couple Lola/Crickett. Glad they found their HEA.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is a great film with an unusual and interesting concept of love, time, and aging. I have watched this film several times to explore the challenging relationships among the characters. The impact of time on an aging individual is so much more striking when contrasted with the aging process in the reverse. This film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button unravels on the canvas of a sick bed before Huricane Katrina.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Lots of things in this movie  SHOULD make you think... about the General Thrust of  truth  vs... untruth....  if you are tripping over not so accurate presentations  and nuances of details...life will not have much meaning or joy for you...but  if you truly TRY to understand  the problems  shown, and try to THINK for yourself  what Truth needs ... to make this a happy planet again...  you are well on the way of service to humanity  a right path...  great movie.  recommended for every young high schooler to  make them more aware...  Before they go join the other Herd  of society
B0001DI0FI|2.0|I recenntly bought the above DVD. But cannot play it on my DVD player it says  \\"Wrong Region Disc\\" I would like to return the DVD, unfotunately I have discarded the package. Could you please advise me further? I want to mention that I have always had very good and prompt service.  Thanks   Harry Shaw
B005J0VPNC|5.0|turning off the shutter sound would be very nice. it gets really annoyingx especially if you have your phone in silent mode and the shutter still sounds
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|I purchased this at a brick and mortar store but felt that I should post a quick impression of the 3D bluray disc for you.  Surprisingly the 3D conversion of the movie was quite good.  Usually in the 3D conversions you get just so so 3D effects because the conversion wasn't done with much care.  The guys who did the 3D conversion on the Lion King at Disney did a great job adding depth and 3D effects to the movie.  Foreground and backgrounds were done perfectly to where it added to the story instead of detracting from it visually.  Characters \\"pop\\" at the right moments and there were not any 3D effects that made the movie worse.  Overall I am very pleased with this and will be picking up the other Disney 3D blurays as they come out.
0817439390|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who buys a DSLR but doesn't know how to use it. The book covers various topics starting from the basics, and gives you interesting exercises to try out on your camera. By the time I finished the first 25-30 pages, following the author and his little exercises, I was pretty comfortable using the Manual mode and even more so with Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority modes.  This book also includes link to the author's website where you can find video tutorials of some of the items covered in the book. I highly recommend watching them, because they help clarify the author's point beyond just text and photos and its a free add on (while the videos are no substitute to the book, they are a welcome add-on).   The book is targeted for DSLRs, but if you have a high end point and shoot with lot of manual modes, you can find it useful too. However, it will be easier to follow the author if you have a DSLR (usually since DSLRs have these settings more easily accessible, than Point and Shoots which require you to dig down in menus). I have a Canon T3i and a Powershot S90. After reading the book, I can take better pictures with my S90 and make good use of all the manual modes it offers, which I found daunting before I read the book. But while reading the book, I kept playing with the DSLR to understand the author's point.  The book is a little wordy. The author often throws in notes from his personal diary, about his experience when he shot the photo. Sometimes these are not even directly related to photography, but I found these interesting to read and sometimes helped me get a glimpse of behind the scene from an already interesting photo. While some people criticized this, I find it a plus. I'd say this book is more creative than scientific.   The author is an experienced Photographer and its nice to learn the tricks from an old-timer Pro, who firmly believes in the basics. I loved the book and it inspires me to go out there and shoot.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very easy to learn and understand, also very fun and entertaining . i recommend it to any lover of puzzles
B0000041LA|3.0|I agree with reviewers here, I must retire the Ashkenazy recording. If you have not purchased the 2009 reissue of Prokofiev The Piano Concertos (Chandos Classics label) with Gutierrez, Berman, and Jarvi, you are missing out on the BEST set of these recordings to date. The recording uses new 24-bit recording technology to produce an incredibly brilliant sound with phenomenal clarity. Jarvi's collaboration is exceptional and unique to the qualities and musicianship of each performer. Magical performances! Gutierrez is phenomenal in both the Prokofiev no 2 and no 3 piano concertos.  Gutierrez's colossal performance is of epic and legendary proportion in no 2.  Magnificent perfection!  This is the best recording of the Prokofiev no 2 piano concerto on record!  Well, folks that about says it all! WOW!! AMAZING! What a phenomenal set! A must for everyone who appreciates the complexity and beauty of Prokofiev's concertos! Gutierrez/Berman/Jarvi's recording is a collector's treasure and keepsake.
1423140591|5.0|One of my children read this book in one and a half days - immediately after receiving it in the mail.  My children love this series.  The author does a great job.  Would love to see more of these put into movies.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it's challenge mind!!  graphic is awesome! puzzle is turn me on!!  99 cents is a steal!!  over 350 votes 5 stars avg!!
142311339X|5.0|This is an excellent book.  My children love this book, and the entire series.  What a great author!  We wish they would make all the books into movies!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Invictus is an extraordinary production.  It takes you from the very beginning.  It gives everyone the opportunity to see how simple the world could be if we look for those things we have in common regardless the color, race or ethnic origin instead of those separate people. More than that...what could happen if not only the world leaders, but everyone makes the decision to forgive, reinvent yourself, believe in you and star over.  Excellent.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun packed game.  You will love it.  It's lots of fun and is worth the money.  I don't give five stars unless it just completely blows me away so the next closest thing is 4.5.  Get it you'll love it.
B003BLPTB0|1.0|This is going to sound a bit ridiculous, but I feel betrayed by Crocs. When I was in Japan with some friends, we hiked up Mt Fuji. The hike back down caused immense pain with my hiking shoes...so bad that I could not walk without pain the next day. I remembered seeing a Crocs kiosk at a mall and thought...what the heck, they are ugly as hell but might be worth it for the comfort. They ended up saving my trip. They were beyond comfortable, and my friend also bought a pair. That shoe was the Cayman. Now, I have tried almost every good looking Croc in the catalog, and all I have found is a switch from the original, ultra-soft Croslite to a new, harder type. I'm sorry folks, but these shoes are the opposite of comfortable. Rather than the originals that alleviated pain, these create pain! I can't even stand in them for a couple hours, let alone a day. The Caymans were the cure for standing long periods. These are just plain hard...harder than the shoes I wear to work. I don't know what happened to Crocs, but it's not me. Others are complaining as well. I thought perhaps the Classics would be like the original Cayman, but alas they are not. Another hard-sole Croc. I recently ordered the Scutes...another of my favorites from a few years back. Will they too be hard? If they are the same as the other new ones I am going to have to give up on this company.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This app is pretty cool.  It will change pictures you've taken with cam, or pics you already have on the phone.  You can come close to creating the same effects with other software but this makes it simple and fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Have trouble keeping my fishing knives sharp and was looking for something that would do the job. Saw Smith's pocket pal advertised so decided to give it a go. The first thing I tried it on was the kitchen knives and was really impressed. In fact so impressed I bought more of them to give to my children. Small, compact and work. Great gadget.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|This one is a nice one.  Get it if you want something simple for taking down QUICK notes.  Use your finger or type.  It saves the notes and allows you to delete.  Simple and nice.
0670022411|1.0|I hated this book so much.  Basically a bodice-ripper without the sex.  Ok ok ok I get it, vampires are good-looking, tea is delicious.  There.  There's your book.  Reading this book made me angry because it could have been good.  I like science mixed in with my fiction, I don't mind a little time travel. Flat, boring, stupid, and LONG.  I am really mystified about the high ratings for this book.  As soon as the first character tossed his tousled hair, I had my doubts but I kept reading because the reviews were so good.  I blame witchcraft for the strangely high ratings.
0142002038|4.0|I feel like I watched a lot of James Bond movies growing up.  But when I go back and watch old James Bond I do not remember many.  So maybe I watched the same ones several times?<br /><br />I have not actually read any of the original books before.  Other than the original Jason Bourne books, I have not really read any of the old spy novels.  I have enjoyed some of the newer, post-cold war spy novels.<br /><br />When I saw this on sale, I figured I would give it a try. It was a fairly quick read.  I had not watched this movie before I read it (not sure how that happened).  The movie and the book were different in several important details.  But the book was better than the movie in all the important places.<br /><br />I have heard that the books are darker than the movies, and that is certainly true.  Bond is questioned in the beginning of the book about whether he is up to the task of being a 00 agent.  M is more cold and calculating than I remember in any of the movies.  Bond drinks as much as the movies, but it seems like he is hiding (and maybe has a drinking problem) in the book.<br /><br />Like the early movies, the books is suggestively sexy without actually coming out and showing much.  Later movies certainly have been more than just suggestive.  The book is no more than PG 13 by today's standards.<br /><br />Bond is a quintessential hero, and I like hero stories.  But while I like the more human Bond of this book, I am not sure I am going to read many more.  It would make a fine beach read.  But not much too it other than that.
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|Scotty has the best voice and I love the songs chosen here.  I am not religious but love the song Dirty Dishes, it brought tears to my eyes.
0385738773|5.0|Thomas awakens in the clutches of Wicked, with the offer to have his memories returned. But Thomas immediately distrusts their offer, despite Teresa's insistence that \\"Wicked is good.\\" They have lied too many times. The Trials may be over, but his adventures in the real world are just beginning.<br /><br />Thomas has been thrown into extreme situations over and over again. But his bravery and loyalty remain. Dashner's future world was finally revealed in the previous novel, The Scorch Trials, as one overcome with a virus that affects the mind. Widespread and driving its victims to a violent, feral state, Wicked exists to find a cure. But Wicked's methods have been to take children and put them through intense (and often fatal) trials to find their perfect test subjects.<br /><br />The Death Cure is the third and final installment in the Maze Runner trilogy. As before, there is plenty of heart-pounding suspense, danger, and excitement. With several twists and surprises along the way, the adventure builds to a big showdown that fans won't want to miss. Marketed for young adults, this dark and violent not-too-distant science fiction trilogy is fast-paced and completely riveting. Impressive and inventive, this is one trilogy that is impossible to put down.
0439023513|1.0|I know I am not in 7th grade, but I really don't get why people like these books so much. The first book was good enough for me to read the full trilogy, but I would say the last book was very lack luster. Overall, I feel the writing is poor- they don't cover much ground and the romance lacks chemistry. Even if you get over the cheesy \\"Mocking Jay\\" concept, major events are glossed over and meaningless things are drug out. I also pretty much hated the main character by the end.  I think that this will be one of the few cases where the movies will be better than the books.  Sorry, I just don't get it.
0316044695|4.0|I found the early chapters a little slow and the timeline jumped around a lot. Once I got to the actual operation though, the pages flew by and I had a hard time putting the book down. Even then there would be a jump to another time or place that was a bit of a distraction. However, I did appreciate the concurrent description of events back at his parent's ranch. That must have ben quite an experience for those who were there. Although it was nothing compared to what Marcus was going through! Marcus does a great job of demonstrating how the SEAL training made it possible for him to survive. He definitely caught a few lucky breaks but even with those he never would have survived without that training. Maybe the Navy should consider making his description of his survival required reading during Hell Week. It might provide a little inspiration.
1419702203|5.0|This is a wonderful compilation of photographs, notes and anecdotal commentary. The photos are nice and follow the arc of George's life up until the mid nineties. Much of the photography comes from George's own cameras and a lot of it is centered in India as I would expect. The book it's self is about 80% photography with notes pertaining to the photos where needed. Nice photo's of Friar park, India, Liverpool and the United States. There also images of letters and drawings that George wrote to various people. It is  someways kind of a scrap book collection of memories.  George was certainly an artist and that comes through is his photography as well. Other contributers to the text part of the book include Ringo, Paul, Ravi Shankar, Eric Clapton and Bob Dylan<br /><br />The book is divided into seven sections that fairly well chronicle different phases of his life. Living in the material world is also an homage to the spirituality of George and the things that influenced him, Olivia Harrison has done a fantastic job keeping that in the forefront of the book. This isn't something haphazardly put together to make a buck, a lot of time, love and devotion went into producing this.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese who produced the film Living in the material world for HBO, which I have not seen yet wrote a forward for this book that was insightful but short about his desire to do this project.<br /><br />All-in-all a very nice addition to my Beatles collection.
0679735909|3.0|I saw the movie, \\"Possession\\", with Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhardt, and really liked it, so thought I'd check out the book.  It is extremely wordy and I am still slogging through it, doggedly determined to finish it.  I recommend the movie, but pass on the book unless you like obscure English literature and academic verbosity.
B005HXGE9G|1.0|This isn't even remaking or re-envisioning.  This is destroying.  Gabriel used to have talent, and he wrote great songs. It seems for the past 10 years, he's just looking for more and more ways to deconstruct and ruin music in the name of art.  Music shouldn't be a failed experiment, it should be a presentation of what you can do best.  This isn't groundbreaking, it's just heartbreaking.  As for this CD.  It sucks.  I was hoping for something that would fill my ears with joy.  I can't even make it through any of these songs before I jump to the next one to see how he destroyed his other classics.  In the words of my son, this CD is an epic fail.
B004ZN9UZO|1.0|5 Star Album, 1 Star from where its made. I love the Floyd PERIOD! But as you said \\"Digipak.\\" DigiPak Sucks.... Notice now that these are made in Mexico?

0071762345|5.0|Being fairly new to facebook on a business level, I researched several books to help us learn how to market ourselves. This book is wonderful. What we found most helpful are the Action Plans at the end of each chapter. My boss and I are actually taking 5 chapters at a time and discussing them. When we started reading, be were on information overload. Marketing through social media is complete opposite of how we are used to marketing ourselves! I would highly recommend this book and already have!
1439102813|5.0|But of course this is a best seller as it deserves to be. I did not read this worrying about anyone --least of all myself-- with Alzheimers though most I know have some of the main symptoms. No, Alice was herself and the book was just so beautiful, as most here know.<br /><br />At the end there is one scene a graph maybe that I found beyond gorgeous. That is when Alice, with all functions gone, can completely understand the emotional monologue practised for theater by her youngest daughter.<br /><br />Ms Genova did not choose this as her favorite scene but I wish if she reads here she will think again. It is the moment of pure redemption we all crave. I was sobbing during the last pages.<br /><br />I had trouble with decoding or finding the right compassion for John, the husband. His portrait is, probably deliberately, ambiguous. I loved all the kids. And their devotion.<br /><br />This is not just a story of someone with Alzheimers' Disease; this is a fine wonderful engaging novel. Thank you Lisa Genova! 10 star read.

B004LWZW42|4.0|X-Men is a franchise that has been around for decades.  Probably considered to be marvel's most versatile group of super heroes and villains set in world where good and evil is based more on perspective than the traditional comic book series.  Though their stories have all been done in ink and many more on the small screen, X-Men is recreated time and time again to fulfill the struggle of the powerful versus the weak, the feared versus the fearful.  X-Men first class is no exception to this pattern.  This movie quickly forces the viewer to understand two very different beginnings to two very different mutant archetypes. The hero and mentor of the future movies, Professor Charles Xavier, starts as a well off and very polite young individual.  Already possessing his psychic powers, he soon shows that he can use his powers to help others.  In a different scenario, we have Eric (magneto) who is a quiet, peaceful Jewish boy caught up in a Nazi camp.  As a horrible event transpires, we show the anger and rage that changed the boy forever, giving us cause to empathize with what was to be X-Men's longest lasting villain.  Aside from creating an interesting viewpoint, the movie was well cast.  There are some points where the cast seem to fall short due to awkward points in the film, such as when the almost goofy looking blue beast makes a side appearance, but other than those small parts the cast is highly relatable and believable.  The story does fall short of meeting Marvel Cannon, but that shouldn't be new to Marvel fans.  The Marvel universe has written off several impossible contradictions as being in a 'different Marvel Universe'.  Over all, the execution of the story causes an understandable, if somewhat overemphasized, perspective of the beginning of both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants.  I must say, I find the movie's end somewhat lacking.  Though the film was spectacular over all, the perception that the majority of the 'non-mutants' evolves much more quickly than is believable.  Though there are characters that provoke this, there was not enough escalation throughout the film to warrant what happens at the end.  The inter-mutant resolution, however, reached a beautiful peak and did not disappoint.  Overall, this was a great Marvel movie based on the perspective of an X-Men fan.  Though there is room for improvement, I would say that it is worth watching.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a very well written book that sparked my imagination and initially brought me into the world of Science Fiction.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|As I write, the Press Lord of Great Britain and the United States, putting aside other nations in which his media disseminate their product, has just been testifying before a Parliamentary Committee on the illegal and unethical practices in which his media have admittedly engaged. It is not now a question of whether it was done but who knew about knew that it was being done and who ordered it to be done.<br />This extended BBC television drama is a tense exciting view of the interactions among powerful economic, political, communications and law enforcement elites. It is best viewed with an open mind, as a drama in which some guys (male and female) can be seen as Good, some as Evil, and, most, as some combination of the two. The acting is top-notch, ditto the script, ditto the direction, ditto the filming (cinematography). Depending on one's personal outlook one will sympathize with one or another individual character. It is to the credit of the creative staff that none comes out without being tarnished in some way, everyone fails to live up to the ideals of their roles. To what extent this fiction can be generalized beyond the specific case, as probably the writers desired, certainly, I could not say. My reading of the film is that it shows clearly that nobody comes to the table with clean hands regardless of their motives; I assume that is what the film was intended to show.<br />The film begins with a murder and adds another early on. I found the revelations with regard to the perpetrator (one who saw that these were done) to be almost entirely subordinated to other concerns. In fact, the murder seemed only to be a dramatic device to add punch, seasoning, to the central  story. You may see otherwise. Regardless, the average viewer of law and order/press drama, should  find this mini-series quite satisfying.
0670022950|1.0|Pinker is either insane, stupid, or pulling our legs.  The man looks at the fate of Western Europe and North America after World War II, notes that armies are no longer clashing on their battlefields, ignores the real political and economic reasons for this, overlooks the preponderance of weapons of mass destruction that have sustained this short period of calm, ignores the subsidiary wars the great powers have continued to fight by proxy in the developing world, ignores the economic injustices that sustain our \\"peaceful\\" economy, talks like a blithering idiot about \\"Enlightenment\\" institutions, pretends that the Enlightenment produced new moral values that underlie our balmy immunity from ever greater warfare, shrugs off the rise of terrorism, refuses to acknowledge the military and technological reasons why wars are now fought differently, and tells us--based on a handful of decades in which bourgeois society has not had to send many of its children to war against other bourgeois societies--that violence is on the wane.  He even employs moronic statistical arguments, that offended my mathematician's soul by their sheer inanity, that the twentieth century was proportionately less violent than, say, the twelfth.  Only a simpleton could possibly take this asinine book seriously.  What an oaf Pinker has become.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|When the headphones work, they work great.  I have had 3 sets of these headphones replaced and will never buy a turtle beach product again.  First time, the ear cup folds which is a nice feature, but if you turn it the wrong way, it snaps and breaks off, so it had to be replaced.  Second time, one side of the headphones just stop receiving any sound, so they had to be replaced again.  Third time, I could chat to other people but I could not hear them.  so they had to be replaced again.  I wish I could just get a refund and purchase something else.   All these problems I encountered other users have had as well.  If you happen to get a good one, good for you.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|So yet again another film comes along that has the audacity to creep into my mind and tousle it around for two hours. I was lucky enough to be one of the (sadly) few around to have seen Terrence Malick's latest, The Tree of Life, this past Saturday in a little dump of a theater in an even bigger dump of of a shopping mall. Talk about your proverbial diamond in the rough.  The film has a lot in common with the book of Job from the Bible (which coincidentally is my favorite). Right off the bat it starts off with a quotation, \\"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation...while the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\\" A small first part of the film deals with the results of the death of a son in the O'Brian family which leads to Mrs. O'Brian posing the question to God as to why this happened to them. This of course is what serves to next show us the \\"Birth of the Universe\\" sequence referenced in the opening quotation. A stunningly breath taking 22 minutes where we see galaxies and planets form without the use of computer generated imagery. I have to applaud Terrence Malick for hiring Douglas Trumbull to do this the old fashioned way (minus the dinosaurs of course). I can recall about a month ago having a \\"conversation\\" with a friend of a friend about recreating something using CGI rather than any other of the old fashioned camera tricks. CGI can be good if you have the money but The Tree of Life again confirms for me that doing things the old fashioned way can yield results that have an authenticity to them that CGI simply can't compete with. I even read a random review where the person said the effects looked and felt more real and solid the way they were done. The music was incredible too and had an epic, cosmic feel to it that gave me goosebumps. The brief dinosaur scene was important to the film too despite some people I had heard laughing at it. In a forest, a young dinosaur cautiously walks around for predators. Later on a riverbank, the dinosaur lies sick. A predator emerges and examines the wounded dinosaur. Preparing for the kill the predator then reconsiders as he watches it struggle against him. The predator wanders off. The point of this is to show that even in nature there is grace, something similar to that which Mrs. O'Brian had stated earlier in the film.       Anyway moving on the core of the film centers on the eldest of the three O'Brian brothers, Jack, as he grows up into adolescence and learns the life lessons and experiences that will mold him later in life. I think this is where Malick is at his best. His style while filming these scenes was to capture a moment, an accident. The results have such a realistic feel to them its hard to believe anybody was actually acting at all. Brad Pitt gives I think his best new performance as the borderline abusive father with overwhelming love for his wife and kids. He occasionally takes out his anger and frustration on them over his current life situation and I guess you could say that's his main character flaw. He represents the nature way of life while his wife, Mrs. O'Brian, played appropriately with angelic grace by Jessica Chastain, represents well, what else, grace. She as a mother is more carefree and forgiving than Mr. O'Brian. Hunter McCracken as young Jack does a fantastic job showing a further and further conflicted young man as he grows older and feels the natural twitches of rebellion that come with adolescence. Sean Penn lastly does well as the older Jack who has lost his faith and is adrift in the modern world. His internal state is wonderfully reflected in the architecture of the city where he works (Dallas, TX). When Jack is young his surroundings are a very simple neighborhood whereas when he is older he is in a large, complex city that one could easily get lost in without a sense of direction. Its amazing how personal some of these scenes were. Little instances like learning how to walk, feeling jealousy at a babybrother being the new center of attention, playing in the street on a summer afternoon, dinner at the table, church on Sundays etc. Simple things we don't notice too much that contain elements that change us into who we are when we are older. All of these are wonderfully recreated and have a human feeling to them that was lacking in Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film most compare this one to for obvious reasons.       I'm sure the none narrative structure of this film threw off most who saw it but you can't read this film like you would a book. To do that will simply frustrate you. I found myself sometimes trying to read it as a narrative only to tell myself to shut up and knock it off. The film is more like visual poetry. Its something you have to surrender to and experience. Doing so actually made me recall something I had read from a letter my Cinema teacher at VCU where I go to college had said many years ago about this sort of thing.         \\"The metaphor most frequently used to interpret a film is that of a text. (We can thank both the  semiotic/linguistic theorists, the genre folks and the pop critics for that.) All start off with a notion that to understand/\\"read\\" a film, it must first somehow be \\"text\\"... It must be a linguistic code...rational...logical etc. Their job is a task of interpretation, a hermeneutic function based on personal taste which then becomes an act of criticism. But what if the film under discussion was constructed as \\"event\\"? What if the filmmakers reject a single authorized reading/interpretation of a film as the \\"truth\\" What if the film is not about the intentions of a single author? What if the filmmaker's understanding of how film operates in a social context is informed by a different metaphor than that of text and hence the interpretation of the intentions of an auteur are not relevant? I use \\"event\\" as a model for the organization of meaning within the filmic experience. That does not render the film itself as meaningless... but rather, the film itself is designed to allow different paths of interpretation within the event. This allows an audience member to experience and understand/choose from a set of possible interpretations their own meanings. The viewer not the critic or the director becomes central in the creation of meaning within the event. No longer are my narrative \\"intentions\\" as director the locus for the \\"true\\" interpretation of the event. As such the film-event can then work under another rule... another metaphor other than \\"text\\" one that better contours the thing in itself which is cinema.\\"       I certainly think films like The Tree of Life pertain to the above and I can understand why people hate Hollywood for not backing more of these types of films. After The Tree of Life won the Palme d'Or this past May I was very sure and hopeful it would be expanded into many theaters nationwide but sadly it wasn't and I had to seize the opportunity to travel a ways to catch a showing and even then like I said before in a small dump of a theater I never heard of or been to before. Quite the travesty if you loved the film as much as I did.     Some closing thoughts.       I find myself quite annoyed at people who find the film pretentious, As I've said before in the past pretentious is such a knee jerk term these days. It's almost a reflex for somebody to say when something strides for greatness or is just plain different. Ambitious is not pretentious.        I believe the strange light (taken from Thomas Wilfred's \\"Opus 161\\"  that appears at the beginning and the end and in some intervals in the film is supposed to represent God, the Alpha and Omega. Several shots also show the sun in the sky. At one point Mrs. O'Brian even points there and tells Jack \\"Thats where God lives.\\"There is even a brief shot of some reflected light on Jacks bedroom wall when he is a baby.       The \\"Afterlife\\" sequence at the end is I don't think really the afterlife or a form of Heaven at all.My own personal interpretation is that its Old Jack bringing together all the memories of all the people in or were in his life together reconciling with them. Putting his demons to rest so to speak. That this is juxtaposed with the death of the universe signals the end of something. In this case most likely Jacks inner turmoil. I feel this way about this because after the sequence is over we cut back to Jack riding down the elevator and walking outside where he stops and gives a little bit of a smile, as if he feels reasonably better.       I certainly feel this is easily the best film of the year and that Terrance Malick is a genius but I don't think it will be given the the recognition it deserves come awards season time. Its too artsy for the Hollywood people although of course I could be wrong and pleasantly surprised in a few months or so.

B0058P7KUA|4.0|Like many other games I got this one for free.  Unlike those many other games though this game actually captured my interest enough for me to play though it to the end.  Cheesy dialogues make for parts of the entertainment, but the core game play itself was pretty good too after getting used to the control a bit.  Control might not be an issue for other people as it seems pretty standard left thumb for movement right thumb to aim.

B0043M56Y6|5.0|This book is a FANTASTIC launching point for any IOS development whether you are using 3D or not.   The book assumes no (zero, zip, zilch) knowledge about objective C and explains everything clearly and concisely [I just love concise]. If you already know Objective C, you can skim, if you no nothing or have forgotten something (like I am constantly doing) the book's approach is great. Experts might complain that it spends time on basics, but I never see that as a valid complaint. I'm an expert and I can tell you that the more you review the basics, the better you'll become.  The book does cover BOTH OpenGLES 1.1 and 2.0, which they should advertise, because... well... that's kind of hugely important. I almost didn't buy this book because I assumed it only covered 1.1 . (hint-hint Amazon)  Another great thing about this book is that the author uses a design methodology where you use C++ heavily to allow for modularity and portability. This also means you get to program a bit in a sane programming language. (Ok that was a little crack at objective C, but lets face it, there is a huge reader base that isn't so crazy about Objective C [me among them])  The approach of the book is basically a walkthrough to develop a working application. It carefully guides you through the innumerable gotchas, booby-traps and land-mines that Apple lays before you. Most importantly, the cognitive effort required to understand the material is minimal because the book takes an applied as opposed to pedantic approach. I'm not sure about your brain cells, but my brain cells aren't so keen about having to absorb all the finer points of iOS allocation/retention protocols just to accomplish the simplest task. Fortunately this book just gets right to the point.   Summary: I can't say enough good things about this book.

B005U9RQNU|5.0|Too bad Breaking Bad must ultimately end (after next season?).  This is a brilliant episode...one of the best.  The soundtrack is worth noting in particular.  Music is oft overlooked...but it makes the final scenes here.  Enjoy!
B005SZAEYO|1.0|I wanted to check out this show because I typically enjoy most shows that air on FX Networks - Sons of Anarchy, The Shield, etc. I couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes before I turned it off. It was horrible. Maybe I'm just not as patient as most to wait for a show to develop or perhaps I don't have the intellectual capabilities to \\"see between the lines\\" but I don't want to have to think to hard when I watch TV. After all, isn't the whole point to forget your troubles and just zone out for a bit? I just didn't get this show, was it a horror or a comedy, or a mix of both? There's so much television to choose from these days...why waste your time with something like this? Unless you have unlimited time on your hands, I'd find something else to watch.
B005FFW46S|1.0|I haven't read the book yet, so this 1-star is for the Kindle version. Note to Terry and the publisher: come down hard on Amazon. They're making you look bad.  The Table of Contents lists \\"Begin Reading\\" as a section. No chapters are listed, just \\"Begin Reading\\". It's genuinely confusing. Did they seriously just put that to instruct us to begin reading there? On that page it says \\"10\\", \\"Begin Reading\\", and then \\"T\\" all alone on a line followed by \\"he goblin experience....\\" What's the \\"10\\" for? I understand books like to start chapters sometimes with a big letter, but you can't just float it off on another line.  Read the other reviews. There are lots of white-space typos.  I strongly suggest people return the Kindle version on principle. There's no excuse for this.

1439192812|5.0|Richard Dawkins' passion for science and reason has never been more evident than in his latest work, an attempt to convey to \\"readers of all ages\\" just how wonderful and magical reality is. The other side of that idea is that no matter how enchanting ancient or modern myths might be, they are not based on reality and they are not nearly as interesting or as exciting as the truth. Dawkins brings this double point home in each of twelve chapters presented as questions, with the myths of many peoples contrasted with reality as determined by science. There will be little controversy over how he handles such questions as What is the sun? What is a rainbow? Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? What is an earthquake? or even Are we alone?<br /><br />Unfortunately, many in America who should read this book probably won't because of their religious beliefs. Those who think Adam was the first person, that the god of Abraham created all animals individually, that the universe was brought into being by the will of some supernatural creator, and that bad things happen because god or the gods are angry with us will reject this or any book that tells the science like it is. Fortunately, the number of people who think the Bible is the word of god and must be taken literally as if it were a science text is not as great in other countries. I imagine the book will do quite well in the UK and other places (in translation) where fundamentalist anti-science is not so great as it is in the U.S.<br /><br />All but two of the chapters focus exclusively on scientific questions. Most chapters begin with a look at some of the traditional myths that have been produced by various cultures around the world. These are followed up with a look at what the science has to say about the subject. The final two chapters enter the realm of philosophy. Why do bad things (like tsunamis and cancer) happen? They just do. There are causes but nature has no purpose in bringing about harm to anyone.What is a miracle? Here he enlists the help of David Hume to convey the idea that belief in miracles is not reasonable.<br /><br />Many adults would benefit from reading The Magic of Reality because it will explain to them things that apparently many of them don't understand, such as why we have summer and winter. Many people think it is because the earth is closer or farther away from the sun that we have the seasons. Many people in the U.S. are clearly ignorant of what evolution means. Many seem to think that if evolution were true we should find one species giving birth to a new species from time to time. Every offspring is the same species as its parents. To help the reader who may not understand how species evolve, Dawkins asks us to imagine a pile of 185 million pictures, each picture being the grandparent of the picture after it. Any two or three or five hundred adjacent pictures will look very similar in terms of species characteristics. But if you go from your picture at one end to your 185 millionth grandparent, you'll see a picture of a fish-like creature.<br /><br />Dawkins doesn't just tell the reader how old the universe is, he explains how we know the age of the universe. He doesn't just tell us what things are made of, he tells us how we know what they're made of.<br /><br />Of course the fundamentalist literalist Jews and Christians will have an awful time with this book. Dawkins treats the Judeo-Christian myths in the same way he treats African or Japanese or American Indian myths. He doesn't make fun of the people who created the stories. He simply retells the stories, occasionally expressing his being baffled at certain parts of various stories, and then contrasts them with what science knows about the same reality that the mythmakers tried to explain. He doesn't ridicule religion or gods, but he does reject those who appeal to a god's intervention or a miracle to avoid trying to answer hard questions about reality. He has no tolerance for thosewho want us to give up trying to understand something because they claim it's miraculous and can't be understood.<br /><br />If you want your child or you want yourself to know something about the various myths of many different cultures without showing any favorites, Dawkins' book fills that requirement quite well. If you want your child or you want yourself to know something about evolution, cosmology, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and the methods of discovery used in those fields, Dawkins' book fills that requirement as well as anybody could.<br /><br />What makes the book even more enticing is that Dawkins has teamed with artist Dave McKean, whose illustrations take the book to a level of visual enjoyment that matches the joy of following Dawkins as he attempts to explain some very complicated ideas in terms even those who will never read the book could understand if they dared do so.

I like the other princess movies but LOVE this one.  Very cute story with cute and funny characters. All of the other princess movies are liked by dad but not really spoken of after watching.  For some reason, MANY dads are just raving about this princess movie-definitely has something in it that they love.  Dad keeps saying what a great movie it is.

030788743X|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading this book for all the, \\"Wow, I'd forgoten about that,\\" moments. The reminders of 1980s (and some 1990s) pop culture were enjoyable and kept me interested in the book.<br /><br />That said, this is not a great novel. The story basically is a teen/young adult story with predictable twists and outcomes. If not for all the pop culture flashbacks, I might not have finished the book. Why then did I give Ready Player One 4 stars? It was all those pop culture flashbacks I just mentioned. It may have been a shameless ploy, but it worked. They were fun and they kept me hooked. There's nothing wrong with that and I thought this was one of the most fun books I've read lately. I probably would read another book by Mr. Cline, but we should keep things in perspective. If not for the nostalgia factor, I don't think reviewers would be calling this a great book, the best book of the year, etc.<br /><br />Just my opinion.

0312965788|5.0|I've read \\"If Only They Could Talk\\" & \\"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet\\" more than 20 years ago. The 2 books are part of ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL.  Back than,  I'd laughed and cried while reading the stories - my favorite character was Herriot's boss, Siegried and Tristan (Siegried's younger brother) and of course all those village follks whom Herriot had encountered during his practice. I have introduced the books to my two teenage sons, and they too, have enjoyed reading them. I have to say \\"If Only They could Talk\\", \\"It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet\\", and \\"Let Sleeping Vets Lie\\" are my top 3 favorites.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Ok so, I see a lot of people that are either saying Hangover Part 2 is either really good, or really bad. Just to be fair; I would rate this movie as Ok. If you loved the first movie, you will only like this one; however, if you only liked the first movie, don't waste your time with this movie. As most people correctly stated, Part 2 is a rehash of the first Hangover. - Same story; same jokes, same characters; different locale. I thought this movie could have been better if it released maybe in  2013 - the audience still remembered all the jokes, and the catch phrases of the first movie. I feel like they could have done a lot with this movie, and although some parts were hilarious, some parts were extremely boring. I would only recommend watching this once, and only buy the DVD if you want to show off to your friends stating that you have both \\"Hangovers\\" on DVD.
B000002J09|4.0|This album has just 8 songs but most of them are very good. 4 songs are instant classics - 'Black Dog', 'Rock N Roll', 'Stairway to Heaven' and 'When the Levee Breaks'. But if you are like me just getting initiated on Led, I would suggest going for Mothership which is a greatest hits collection and sports the best from each of their albums including the four I mentioned.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I couldn't wait for The Night Circus to appear on my Kindle. Once there, it was so boring I couldn't wait for it to end. A good edit of 200 pages might have helped The Night Circus. The \\"amazing\\" drowned in endless descriptions going nowhere. If the book had been aimed at a juvenile audience, Widget and Poppet could have carried the plot and enriched expectations. I read the last 20% of the book twice in hopes of finding some hidden literary miracle. Sorry, the magic just did not happen.

B005NPCJ88|5.0|Yes, I consider this the New Wave of American Heavy Metal!!  Let me preface my review by saying that I'm a guitarist who, sadly enough, hasn't listened to many lyrics in songs for the past 20 years.  5FDP changed that a few years back.  Not since the days of Pantera have I enjoyed the wait of a band's new album being released!  I love their distinct sound/tone- the guitars and bass, the vocals, and most of all.... the drums!  lol.  Yes, Moody has some sweet vocal range that he has shown more and more on each album.  Bathory and Hook have returned, with the new guy- Kael, to lay down the patented riffage you will hum as you try to go to sleep at night.  But, DAMN, Spencer does some serious beats on the drums.  He did an interview a few months back and said that this was the hardest album for him so far.  Really?  I love his rhythms from verse to prechorus to chorus!  Just listen to If I Fall.  They're BREWTAL.    I'll try to give a brief desription of each one:  1. American Capitalist- 5 of 5, Typical 5 Finger sound- which is AWESOME.  2. Under and Over It- 5 of 5, More great 5 Finger riffage.  Essentially, Moody talling eeveryone to F@*# Off  3. The Pride- 5 of 5,   4. Coming Down- 4 of 5,  Great melodic vocals.  Good song, just VERY radio friendly  5. Menace 4 of 5, Seems more of a \\"filler\\" song, epecially being in the middle of the album  6. Generation Dead 4 of 5, Not use to having arpeggios in the verso of a heavy song.  Seems like another filler.     7. Back For More 6 of 5, In case you can't tell- I really dig this song.  Not really a typical 5 Figer song, except the chorus, but I dig the riffage.  8. Remember Everything 4 of 5, another VERY radio friendly song, did I mention that I don't listen to the radio?  The music seriously reminds me of an 80's Def Leppard song? WTF!!  9. Wicked Ways 5 of 5, More of Spencers beats, more Moody's vocals, and more of Bachory and Hooks riffage..... need I say more?  10. If I Fall- 5 of 5, I definitely dig this song, At thebeginning I was like, \\"Oh snap\\" and then it just kicked Azz.  MAJOR Azz!  11. 100 Ways to Hate- 5 of 5, Kind of like with War Is the Answer, 5FDP saves some of their best songs for last.  Such is the case with the last 3 on this one.  And this is the best of those.    Hopefully my ramblings will help you with YOUR decision!  lol.  I've listened to the album 3 times since midnite, so I'm giving you my honest opinions- from an EXTREME 5 Finger Death Punch fan.  Even their \\"BAD\\" to me are pretty damn good songs- just not my style.  If you're new to 5 Finger- definitely try out American Capitalist, Over and Under It, If I Fall, and 100 Ways to Hate.  If you're already a fan- hurry up and buy this thing, so they can get some major tour dates across the States!  Peace and Styches to all the Bytches- otherwise- see you in the Pits!  JMart

1439153663|4.0|I read this book for my book club meeting this month, and I was very glad I did.  I had never heard the title before my book club group decided to read it.  I enjoyed the novel a great deal.  The differences in the way people are treated, depending on whether they are black or white, is pretty clear. The thing about \\"Black\\" or \\"White\\" in this novel, however, becomes a bit cloudy because many (if not most) of the slaves are at least 50 percent white.  As time advances and Lavinia grows up, we see that Belle's son Jamie Pyke is actually 75 percent white.  Lavinia describes Jamie by saying, \\"His sandy-colored hair had a soft curl, and his blue eyes looked out from a face might have been Campbell's.  However, I immediately noted that his left eye was clouded over, and from the way he held his head to look at me, it was clear that his vision was impaired.\\"  As I traced his family tree I began to wonder if Jamie suffered from anything more than impaired vision.  His grandfather was Captain James Pyke on his father's side AND on his mother's side also.  That means that his mother and father were siblings, and his father is also his uncle.  I could not help wondering if this incestuous pattern would have continued if the characters had lived.  I am pretty sure it would have.
B000JQUZCI|3.0|This book was both a masterpiece in the style it was written in, yet both a total mind-f**k in the plot set up.  Overall, I give this book 3 stars for it was not entirely interesting to me, included a lot of \\"filler\\" scenes, yet kept the plot twisted enough to keep me reading.  Not a bad book if you want to hear the real side of Frankenstein and his twisted thoughts in the Dr. Jeckle - Mr. Hyde relationship, but also the realization that man is almost entirely greedy and selfish.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have to admit, I went into reading this with some trepidation. Most zombie fiction I've read hasn't been exactly well done, often just a rehash of everything ever written. This took things from a different perspective, and threw in a wee bit of social commentary to boot. If you're a fan of zombies I highly recommend the book.  SPOILER!  That said, the only part I didn't like was the \\"zombies survive at the bottom of the ocean all over the world\\" bit. While there are certainly a large amount of humans on the planet, the oceans cover better than 2/3 of the planet. As well, it is noted in several places in the book that zombies are decaying, albeit slowly. In the ocean that decay wouldn't exactly be slowed. On top of that, with no sound, no light, and no reason to be interested, a group of zombies effectively attacking a submarine at full stop on the bottom of the ocean? A few nitpicks in there along those lines. Other than that, give it a read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm happy to download kindle i'm thinking about investing in one this is a good way learn about and ebooks thank you amazon
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|After having trouble finding it in stores, I went to trusty amazon.  Not only did it arrive promptly, but it arrived in perfect condition.  It has a beautiful blu ray transfer, in my opinion, and for further info, I also enjoyed the Beauty and the Beast transfer.  It has a dazzling main menu, and I haven't tried the 3D, but I hear it's good.  The best part is the Digital copy, I can take the pride Lands with me where ever I go!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|First let me just say that this is how a \\"deluxe edition\\" of an album should be done. After Roadrunner Record's flawed \\"deluxe edition\\" physical release of Within Temptation's latest masterpiece [[ASIN:B004E2XAFW The Unforgiving (Special Edition CD+DVD)]] (in which Roadrunner Records failed to include the bonus tracks on the physical release), I am glad that Wind-Up at least thought enough of the fans to include all the extra songs from this album's sessions, on the physical release. I truly wish that all \\"deluxe editions\\" could be like this. Much respect to Wind-Up for that move. Now onto the album.<br /><br />The debut single is 'What You Want', which is definitely a very different song for Evanescence, with an intro hook that sounds more like it should be in a new song for Katy Perry. Once the song gets going, however, it's a pretty decent, catchy track. But there is much better material to be offered by this album. Next up is 'Made Of Stone' which sounds more like a cross of [[ASIN:B000FTWB7G The Open Door]] and We Are The Fallen's [[ASIN:B003ENTMG8 Tear The World Down]] with some nice vocals, where the tender bridge is the shining moment for me in this song. In my opinion, 'The Change' is one of the best songs to be found on this album. It actually reminds me more of the Evanescence before [[ASIN:B000089RVX Fallen]], with a beautifully melodic verse and haunting vocal harmonies from Amy, as well as a more brooding bassline/piano that creates a sorrowful atmosphere. Now none of the songs on this album are near as solemn as what the amazing band Katatonia can pull off (like on their latest masterpiece [[ASIN:B002NXX8EC Night Is the New Day]]), but still there are a few songs that have a darker, more subdued sound (maybe more in the vein of A Perfect Circle?). Needless to say, I really like it!<br /><br />From there we go into the album's first piano-driven ballad called 'My Heart Is Broken' (sure it's a weak title but don't let that stop you because it's a great song). At first you expect another 'My Immortal' to lull you into a false sense of peace until the crunching guitar riff comes in rather quickly in the first verse. The commanding chorus (with some nice strings added in) really drives this song home and into the \\"highlights\\" category. There are some sweet drum moments in 'The Other Side', but the song doesn't stand out as much except during the bridge. 'Erase This' has a more uptempo piano melody that starts the song off with a nice amount of energy and a good chorus and even better bridge once the strings come in behind Amy. Then the next power ballad 'Lost In Paradise' is another beautiful piano driven song which has a very epic chorus that is very hard to not tap your fingers to, especially once the whole band joins in. The orchestra and Amy's vocals during the bridge gives me chills every time. Really powerful and probably my favorite song off the entire cd! Then we get to 'Sick' which has a wicked intro bassline, even briefly bringing to mind the Tool song 'Forty Six And 2'. The drums keep up and add an aggressive driving tempo during the verses. I am not as fond of the chorus, but it's still a very good song for Evanescence and proves they can create some nice rocking rhythms.<br /><br />After that previous song, 'End Of The Dream' kinda fails to impress me as much, but still a decent song. 'Oceans' begins with another new, unexpected sound from Evanescence, which sounds like a really distorted synth to provide the foundation to the the song as Amy's familiar voice comes in to remind the listener this is still Evanescence, just trying some new (and welcome) sounds. Great melody, great drums, awesome vocals. A lot of people will like the uptempo 'Never Go Back' but for some reason, I don't like it quite as much as the other songs on the album. The guitars would be the highlight here, but the melody of the chorus is what I am not too fond of. Finally, we get yet another unique Evanescence sound which is providedsolely by some pop/ambient synths. There is no \\"rock\\" to be found here, but Amy sings the song solidly enough to where I actually really like it. It gives another new sound to the cd and it actually is quite a pretty song once you can swallow down the extra cheese. The DVD is pretty much just what it says, the 'What You Want' music video, and several \\"making of\\" features.<br /><br />If I had any one complaint, it really would just have to be the packaging for the deluxe edition. I hate digi-packs because it doesn't take long for them to get ripped up, worn corners and scratches on the cds (especially when they don't have a plastic tray for the discs to snap into, which unfortunately, this album does not have...it's just like the packaging from We Are The Fallen's album where you fit the discs into the disc-scuffing paperstock sleeves). I don't understand why record labels always give the deluxe versions cheaper casings than the standard editions that protect the cds better. But because Wind-Up gave us the four extra songs (of which, 'Disappear' is my favorite, though 'Secret Door' also deserves mention since we hear Amy's harp plucking skills), I can't dwell on that minor issue. Anyways, when all is said and done, do I think this is the next FALLEN? No, I wouldn't go that far because it still lacks the infectious guitar riffs (or another 'My Immortal') from Ben Moody. But I do believe that this album will surpass THE OPEN DOOR (at least in the ears of most fans) and it is a welcome return from Evanescence, who shows that they still have a lot to offer once they can just get past all of the drama. Female fronted bands always seem to deliver quality albums and EVANESCENCE is no exception. So now I say bring on the new Autumn album [[ASIN:B0051DSACG Cold Comfort]] for next month!synths.

B005ELQVGW|2.0|This has to be the worst album Bjork has released in her long career: dull, flat, and unevocative. Yes, the era of the CD singles is over, but that does not justify releasing an album with absolutely no stand-out tunes. Perhaps middle age has caught up with Bjork, and dullness has become acceptable for the artist who once crafted magnificent, memorable tunes such as \\"Bachelorette\\" and \\"Big Time Sensuality.\\" An absolute waste of time.
B0002NIRIC|2.0|Personally I don't like the sliding sound from bass wound strings, unfortunately this product doesn't reduce it.  To reduce string noise lower the action and lift fingers
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|I'll make this review for the whole series even though it's listed here under Season 2.  As a mostly casual (not rabid) fan of the Stargate Franchise, I was told to avoid this series since it was mostly terrible.  Well, that was pretty bad advise.  It's really quite good, thought provoking, occasionally touching, sad, odd, and suspenseful all in the same episode sometimes!  My biggest complaint is that there wasn't much chemistry between the team members early on.  It wasn't until season 2 that things started to click regularly.  Also, I found some of the characters just plain dark -- yeah, I'm talking about you Dr. Rush.  Also, some of the story arcs seemed derivative of the other Franchise shows -- yeah, drone ship subplot is a ripoff of the replicators.  Still, the show grows on you and by the middle of Season 1 I was sold. By the end of Season 2, I was sad there wouldn't be any more.  In fact, the episode called \\"Epilogue\\" from Season 2 is a standout and I defy anyone to find a more compelling story to tell in the entire Franchise.  It's one of those truly thought provoking stories that you talk about for weeks if not months.  Yeah, it's THAT good.    So, even if you're a casual fan of Stargate, I'd recommend this.  Four and half stars really.
030745455X|5.0|Having gotten to know all the characters involved through the first book in the series, this was far more fast-paced and thrilling. This book focuses primarily on Salander, though Blomkvist is also integral to the plot of course. Salander's character comes through wonderfully in this book and how circumstances in her life have made her extremely manipulative and smart. Can't wait to read the final book of the trilogy. How I wish Steigg Larsson had gotten a chance to finish all 10-11 books in the series as he had planned. A very big loss to us fans.
B003XKPPOU|4.0|Good Blu Ray Quality, best value for your money.  There's only one odd thing, it plays it automatically in french when I start it.  Kind of odd but ehh.  Not being the hugest fan of Toy Story trilogy, when I rented this movie I was surprised at how deep it is.  It's got a good storyline, and it was definitely intended for those of us who've been waiting for years.  It's storyline is deep, and a little sad at times, and you'll definitely shed some tears.  It's definitely the best in the trilogy, hands down.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|I own all the movies as individual sets. I would like to own a special edition box set with all 8 films. However, until they make it truelly SPECIAL EDITION with someting new to add to the original individual sets, I don't want this set because the original indivdual sets have more to offer.  If you only care about the theatrical film versions, okay the buy it. I gave it a 3 instead of 1 because I'm sure its a great set for those who only care about the individual theatrical versions. But as for me I'm fine without it until it has some serious improvements.
B0027HOBM2|4.0|Best show on TV. The cometary is quite good too and well worth the buy. If you've never seen the show start with the first season or you will be quite lost.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow! I was really impressed with this book! I could not put it down for just one second! This is truly the best book in the world!
B0026PW67W|5.0|The map is great. I love the movies and this is a really fun prop. I'm thinking about framing it, but it such a cool foldout.
B004SRNH10|2.0|can't seem to install.  clueless about the reason why.  fortunately flash works.  hope a new version comes out soon that works.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|Bluray quality: Perfect  DVD quality: What you'd expect  Digital Copy: YES!  I love this movie, and it arrived the day it came out, as always my experience with amazon.  I love this movie, and it really reminds me of the golden age of disney, because of it's original animation, and it's cute, interesting, but easy to follow storyline.  This movie will be perfect to add to anyone's disney collection.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|New update killed the game on my phone! All I get is a black screen! I want a fix now!
B0017JKEL8|4.0|Best show on TV. The cometary is quite good too and well worth the buy. If you've never seen the show start with this Blu-ray.
B005EHNPRO|5.0|I have been listening to Wilco for about ten years and have all of their recordings on Vinyl. The Whole Love is an excellent recording from a sonics perspective and artistically it is one of their best.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love The Big Bang Theory DVD set. There is nothing like having something comical to watch after a long stressful day.
B004ZG5EYC|4.0|This movie is a pure french film, witty, amusing, and let's not forget the beautiful screens of Montemartre and Le Sacre-Coeur.  It's cute, and it has a beautiful bluray transfer.  If you're on the fence about getting it, do get it, because it's beautiful.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|I've tried this unit with a Mac Mini...worked fine and now an older Sony CD player with digi out.  I have it wired up to a receiver so I can A/B the sound easily between the Sony analog out and the FiiO analog out. I can clearly hear that the Sony out is brighter sounding. The FiiO seems to smoothing out the high-end. I have further testing to do. In any case it's a steal of deal.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I found someone put the entire album up on Youtube (track-by-track as usual) and gave a few songs a listen. I didn't want to spoil the final effort.   After picking up a CD, I usually rip about 4-5 (maybe 7 at the most) tracks into my computer to sync to my phone.   I ripped 12 on this one!  Much darker and heavier than I anticipated and well worth the wait. I just wish they didn't use the cardboard packing because I already have a seam tear.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The best keyboard I have used on a smart phone and I've had iphones to blackberry to android. Bravo. Worth EVERY penny.
B005IY3CMQ|4.0|I have enjoyed this CD playing in the background while working/eating/etc. If you expect much more than that, you might be disappointed. But I enjoy hearing how other artists tweak this incredible CD, and like not having to pay much attention to get value out of it.   Radiohead is my all time favorite band, and I view this as a nice addition to my collection.
0439023521|5.0|My son was telling me yesteday that the book was really good. I guess it was a good choice on my part!
0783225725|3.0|I noted a previous comment in a review that it needed to be remastered for DVD or Blu-ray.  More than that, it is poorest quality movie in DVD that I've ever seen.  I also can't make it fill up the screen on my 50 inch HD screen.
0345529057|5.0|This set was a wonderful value!  I ordered this because I liked the HBO series so well and I was not dissappointed.  Each book is around 1000 pages, but I couldn't put them down!  Can't wait to get the next book.
B000093FLA|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS A CLASSIC AS SOON AS I HIT PLAY ON MY VCR IN 2001 WHEN I FIRST WATCHED THIS. TOTALLY ENTERTAINGING FROM BEGINNING TO END. BRAD PITT REALLY IMPRESSED ME THE MOST AND LOVED SEEING JASON STATHAM AGAIN. HE WAS SO AWESOME IN LOCK STOCK. WISH THAT GUY WOULD MAKE A 3RD (NOT COUNTING REVOLVER) FILM INCLUDING MANY OF THE SAME ACTORS LIKE BRICK TOP AND BULLET TOOTH. YES I WILLL STRONGLY RECOMMEND. I BOUGHT THE DVD A WEEK AFTER BUYING THE VHS. THEN YEARS LATER I BOUGHT THE SPECIAL DVD EDITION WHICH CAME WITH A BOOKLET AND POKER SET. AWESOME COLLECTION !
044024238X|3.0|From time to time, i love to read a book that is light hearted and funny - or otherwise known as 'chic lit' or 'beach read'. Likeable characters and humorous situations make it a fast read. The author kept it real about Samantha second guessing herself  in the end about what would keep her happy - Domestic Help vs. Lawyer. This illustrates how we always try to go back to what we are used to, even if it is not good for us when we are challenged with the brave new world. To me, this made the book one of the better ones in the category.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED! Instructions were super easy to follow....very nice price FREE! LOL. . I use it every time I get bored.  FIVE stars!! Kinda hard at first but thats what makes it interesting.
0307277887|5.0|This book was thrilling. I couldn't put it down and read it in about a week, which is fast for me! I have seen the Showtime series and have to say, the books are as good as the series, but different, in a good way.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Great experience. Item came in the condition that was advertised, in the original packaging and with the original instructions included. Arrived in advance of the time that was estimated. The SB 400 fit my needs. It gives me the additional lighting that I need to enhance my picture taking experiences
0671449028|5.0|How could you not like Sandra Boynton's books? It has a cute rhyming scheme and my five month old likes the bright colors. I also don't get sick of reading it over and over! As a teacher, I couldn't NOT give a book like this a great review!! It's so important to read to your kids early and often and this book is a great start!
B002S0OBMS|3.0|I can't help but listen to this album from the guise of a fan of Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, as this one purports to continue the storyline of Christine, the Phantom, Raoul, and Madame and Meg Giry. This recording (and the show it represents) gives the listener some exciting new material but plenty of obstacles to our enjoyment. Lloyd Webber would do well to analyze why his Phantom musical has done so well, both in ticket revenue and in album sales. What PotO has going for it is a balance of beautiful lyrical musical numbers (the title theme song, Masquerade, All I Ask of You, for instance) with scene music and dialogue-like recitative music. We have the indulgent pleasure at launching into a stunning, well-orchestrated piece of music that lets a character expose their emotions to us. That, again, is the in original PotO. Love Never Dies gets in trouble for overly orchestrating too many dialogue-like recitatives and so the line between a musical number and a scene is blurred, making the listener feel like they aren't getting a big, juicy musical number. Also, Lloyd Webber's rhyming rhythm in LND is far too frequent, making the dialogue-recitative singing sound campy and burdensome to be able to fit the far-too-frequent rhyme scheme. What lacks in these sections is truly well-written music; Lloyd Webber is trading in a melodic entity of music for choppy short phrases so that the characters can spit (and I mean, literally, spit) out their speak-singing lines to tell us what is going on. That is another reason why LND doesn't ever fully take off; the music is burdened with too much narrative and so there just feels like too much of it, all the time.   Other things that distracted: Lloyd Webber wrote this musical to take place on Coney Island where the musical style in performance is far more obnoxious and brassy than in PotO where Opera is the musical genre of inspiration. The \\"Bathing Beauty\\" and other Coney-esque melodies are astringent nuisances - thank goodness we can hit skip on the CD player. (The exceptions, however, are the far more inspired and more musical pieces like the Coney Island Waltz).   What is lacking in LND is a balance of awesome wonder with the extreme emotions. In PotO, we had the entire first act to get us awestruck - the overture, the Angel of Music turned PotO theme song, then Music of the Night. The audience is whisked into a seductive world by the Phantom's doing. But in LND, we aren't EVER able to relax and take in a world like that. This musical is all high emotions resulting from having them pent up since the end of the PotO. I have to laugh out loud at the frequency of trite emotional outbursts that the characters scream in the second CD --- the last scene, for instance, involves screams from Meg, then Gustave, then Phantom, then Gustave again ---- it is just too much. The story really should be about Christine, but because Sierra Boggess and her Christine have more decency and class than to outburst all the time, the louder characters (Phantom, Meg, Madame Giry) far overshadow her. Are we supposed to focus our energy on Christine's dying, or on Phantom and Meg's wailing? I can't tell, and I wish Lloyd Webber's music would better facilitate our attention.   I particularly enjoyed the Coney Island Waltz, the theme song Love Never Dies, Til I Hear You Sing Again, the Entr'Act, Look with your Heart, Once Upon Another Time, and the reprise of Twisted Every Way. These are all delicious, indulgent musical experiences that show Lloyd Webber where he is best. They are, unfortunately, buried under superfluous scene music that takes up far too much time on the CD. I suppose that we'd be lost listening to the CD without the speak-singing dialogue--- but Lloyd Webber could have chosen to include the libretto in the booklet and written more of the scenes with spoken text and musical underlay instead.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|An excellent family movie.The story line and characters keep you engaged throughout as they sweep you into a world that ushers in the world of Peter Pan.
1741751772|5.0|Excellent read, taking you to another place and time and immersing you in another way of life.  All of Kate Morton's books have struck me and kept my attention.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Tony Bennett is still elegant, even though age erodes his delivery a little. And I wish to put in a word for his excellent arrangers who enhanced the duets.   Most of the singers were fine, with one notable weakness. Carrie Underwood lacks the resonance and timbre to sing along with Bennett, and her delivery was all too much paint-by-the number. Her voice is very thin.
0060853972|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Expertly written, super creative story, and great wit. Neil Gaiman is a master of his craft.
B00009UW0N|1.0|The movie speaks for itself. However, they cropped out Linda's boobs when she's laying in bed. That's one of my favorite parts!!!!(no pun intended) You see them 20 seconds later when she gets strangled on the phone so WTF!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Beat it and I want MORE. Nice puzzle game took me a few days to beat it. Was pretty addictive.
0553801473|2.0|As many others have already pointed out (although not as succinctly): stop reading this series.<br /><br />It's painfully obvious Martin is incapable of managing his characters and the world they inhabit.  The way readers have been strung along for the last 2000+ pages with virtually no resolution or satisfaction is a literary crime.<br /><br />I really, really wish that a competent writer would author an UNOFFICIAL 6th book that wrapped all of this up.
0061148512|4.0|The Bell Jar, written by the late Sylvia Plath, is like an unstoppable ride on the tracks of depression; the momentum is building up so quickly, so even if one wanted to jump off the tracks, it is too late.  The only way out was suicide.  Sylvia Plath wanted to become a writer.  Her first job was for a magazine in New York; she chronicles her experiences in her novel.  Although she wrote in a pen name, everyone in the literary community knew The Bell Jar was her novel.  She had literary success for her poetry.  And her husband was another writer; but he was an errant husband and jealous of his wife's success.  She wanted desperately to have The Bell Jar published.  Publishers were critical of her manuscript, saying it was infantile and not literary.  They felt it was more of a memoir than of a piece of literature. She had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals, and had electric shock therapy.   She and her mother had a strained relationship.  Her father died when she was young, and she missed him and mourned her loss. Her mother did not want the manuscript to be published, as she thought Sylvia had made hurtful statements about people who tried to help her; but Sylvia was too far gone into her deep depression.  So basically it is a chronical of her fictional character's feelings and experiences masking her own life. Although I normally do not like a stream of consciousness style of writing, her lapses of memory, problems with transitional elements or inability to continue with a thought provides the reader with the insight into the mind of a tortured soul.  In the book she attempts, but does not commit suicide.  But the audience is told that she becomes a professor of literature in England.  She was already divorced and taking care of two children.  I forget the name of a famous writer's home in which she resided in England, but she had chronic sinusitus living in a dank house.  The day of her death she made toast with butter and tea and placed it in the children's room.  She opened their windows, then taped the bedroom door shut.  She went to the kitchen and turned on the gas.  The children were saved, although I heard recently that one of her sons committed suicide.  Her husband had the rights to her manuscript.  He was trying to honor the wishes of his mother-in-law.  However, boot-leg copies were already being passed along, some reaching the States.  A savy publishing company was able to gain rights and start publishing immediately.  The movie made with Gwyneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig was pretty close to the book.  Obviously this is not a fun book.  But if one is in the field of psychology or interested in stepping into the mind of someone else, then this novel is worth reading. Some people compared the works of J.D. Salinger to those of Sylvia Plath.  I would recommend reading the novel due to it's controversial content and make your own opinion about the novel.
0385344325|3.0|A huge fan of Lee Child and Jack Reacher, I was slightly disappointed by his latest in THE AFFAIR.  There was much less ass-kicking, and much more filler than in previous books. It is as if Mr. Child lost sight of what he was doing with this one.  I'd be less enthused to recommend Lee Child to other writers if this was the only thing to base such a recommendation on.  Over all not the best in his body of work.
0451167716|5.0|I am a Godfather film fan since it first came out, all three episodes. This is the first time I have read the Book and am particularly enjoying some of the background and  personalities not included in the movie.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Fantastic album with a great sound, and very well produced.  Trucks' expressive guitar work is as powerful and Tedeschi's strong vocals, and the 11 piece band is as talented as any you'll find anywhere.  Just a great all around album WELL worth a regular spot in your rotation.  And an even better live band.  Go see them, you won't regret it.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Just so some of you know that no one could have released the series of SMDM in the US for copyright reasons, so anyone ranting about it is wasting thier breath...when the copyright wore off, Universal released the series almost to exact HOUR as an entire collection first and I had to have it!!  It amy not be re-mastered but it is good enough for me to watch and relive the glory of the 70's!!  So to all you guys who will be ordering the seasons as they come out...I have all of them already and love them!!  They are good stories and much better than the crap on TV now.  Now, back to waching the Six Million Dollar Man battle the Seven Million Dollar Man!!!
B005Q2XTLY|5.0|Many might say that Biophilia is a sonic blend of Vespertine, Homogenic, and Medulla, peppered with a little bit of Drawing Restraint 9, but I believe that Biophilia stands on its own right as being one of Bjork's best albums. Unfortunately though, it is an album that I think only few will truly appreciate while others will take for granted or call it \\"dull\\" and \\"boring.\\" I've noticed that many fans, even the diehard ones, are whining and complaining about how Bjork needs to go back to the same beats and catchy pop songs that made her famous in the 90's. It's a shame, because more than likely Bjork will never go back to what she did in the 90's, and why would she? Bjork has never been one to please or cater to her fans, even the most diehard Bjork fan should know that by now. And those who are still crying for the Bjork of the past or the albums of the past (Post, Homogenic, and Vespertine), are entirely missing the point of what Biophilia was meant to be. It's not meant to be a pop record. It's not meant to be another Post, Homogenic, or Vespertine. It's meant to be a concept album in which the songs and their structure represent a scientific phenomena and of the spaciousness, the curiosity, and the wonder of our universe and of nature. Hence is why what we have here is a very minimalist album, a sometimes slow-moving but intriguing album, that is both fascinating but complex and challenging at the same time. Even if at times this all becomes gimmicky with the apps, the essays, etc., Biophilia is an album on a mission, it's an album that sends a musical/scientific message and that demands its listeners to think and learn and perhaps educate others (more so through the apps than through the songs themselves). I think all of this is lost on most people, which is why I think Biophilia will end up being Bjork's most respected album but also her most misunderstood, underrated album. Everyone wants another Homogenic or Vespertine, instead of appreciating this album for what it is.<br /><br />As a whole, this album is truly beautiful. It's an album that only Bjork could have done. I was blown away by tracks such as Cosmogony, Virus, Mutual Core, Sacrifice, Thunderbolt, and Solstice, while even the most underwhelming tracks for me, Hollow and Dark Matter, are still breathtaking to the ears. The album is by no means perfect, it has some low points and some very high points, perhaps one wishes or craves for Bjork to show more emotion in its lyrics, but overall, it's still as strong a record as anything she did 5-10 years ago. It's nice to see Bjork back in form in creating an album with structure, substance, and as always, with a lot of heart and spunk. Bravo Bjork, bravo!hat it is.

0385344325|2.0|I've read them all, and that might be my problem - but I'm at the point where I think I've read some of this story before.  You know the drill:  Reacher is in a small town, encounters locals who try to intimidate him, Reacher sends them away very hurt.  Just why do these folks appear in the story?  They don't add anything to the plot and we've seen this action before.  Several parts of the novel were disjointed to me, almost as if they were a \\"force fit\\" into the story line.  For instance, all of the detailed hoo-hah involving Devereaux's military history, the appearance and quick disappearance of the militia (I would have liked to have seen more of Reacher vs. the militia - oh wait, there's a book for that), and his toothbrush.  I read a review that indicated we'd finally get the backstory of how he came to acquire the toothbrush and all I can say is \\"Meh\\" - he bought it in the post exchange.  He also bought a pair of socks the same time he got the toothbrush, but we don't hear about the socks in every Reacher.  Also, the introduction of his brother - Reacher attempts to get in touch with him twice and he's out of the office, TDY somewhere in Georgia.  Unless you've read \\"Killing Floor\\" that character introduction would seem to be pointless and a bit odd.  And as long as I'm nit-picking, a Major's subdued rank is not a black oak leaf - that's the rank for a Lt Col.  I'm a bit disappointed in that, but it jumped right out at me.<br /><br />In all, my expectations were much higher - I think he's phoning it in now. At least it's starting to seem that way.

B000A2WNB2|5.0|I watched HAARP and Absolution live and nothing was better than HULLABALOO Live. We'll just have to wait for Resistance Live to consider it again.  Sooo, the show is awesome, but don't expect a lot of features. There's nothing interesting but the show.   And I don't know how but there are 3 songs, I think, that you can change the camera view while playing. Interesting.  This show had changed my point of view for several MUSE songs ; I see them now WAY more epic.   Yeah, I think \\"EPIC\\" is the word to describe this LIVE dvd.  If you're a Muse fan, you NEED this, it's a jewel. And it's very underestimated.

1439148953|2.0|I don't know where I read that this was such a captivating novel, but it wasn't. It wasn't that good. Sure the guy can write but he's not successful about engaging the reader, the character's turn out one dimensional, in spite of the writer's talent. The plot is simplistic, hardly developed, not detailed enough, calling the novel,\\"Brooklyn\\" is a joke, there's not one thing redolent of Brooklyn in this novel except for a couple of street names and locations, it could have been set in Cincinnati for all it matters.<br />Just a great disappointment with a terrible and undeveloped unsatisfying ending. This novel couldn't win a prize at a turkey shoot no less a Booker or something.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|- 4.5 stars.. due to this being an awesome album.  - I've listened to LOTS of the live shows from R.A.Archive and have become used to the kick butt harmonies....so there seems to be some spots in the songs where N.C. would have been awesome...along with rest of the Cardinal crew.  - clean recording and production  - great lyrics.   - all and all, simply awesome.  - i hate comparing an artists new albums to older albums but this is like hybrid of Gold/Love Is Hell and 29....again, just my opinion
B0053VKP8S|5.0|If you are deciding between the two available on Amazon, just go for this one... it's half -price and it works exactly as expected  good quality too) comes in a very small box, and \\"just works\\".  Enjoy!
0735327793|5.0|This is the first Mudpuppy puzzle I have ever bought. I picked it up for my grandson at a teacher supply store and it is the best puzzle I have ever bought. I bought some awful wooden puzzles from Amazon, can't remember the name, that broke when he played with them because they were so hard to pull apart.. These are made of excellent thick cardboard. They will last if taken care of, so we stress that with the little guy. The picture is bright (we have the Hungry Catepillar). He plays with it a lot. I would recommend and I will buy again.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|Great protection for the galaxy s2. I have the at&t version and it fits it like a glove. FYI, the sprint version and T-Mobile version are bigger then the at@t version and will not fit this case. Comes with cloth which should be used to get all the little debris off before applying the screen protector, which can be a pain to install. Layers of protection make this an awesome product for my at&t galaxy s2.

B005IY3CMQ|1.0|hopefully next time they can finish up perfectly by maybe polishing up their original musical rock roots.   better ambient music is found elsewhere i.e. the weather channel's LOCAL ON THE 8'S instrumentals that sound like u2 & what radiohead should only go so far in doing-ambient stuff like ryan farish doing supernova and songbird-his best type stuff.   its cool @ least 3 or more reviewers above agrees w/ me.   tanx radiohead-(RH) for the long past!  sam kinison, a great, past, hard core comedian would continually like say: ohhhhhhhhhh!, oh!, ohhhhhhhhhhhh!, they didnt stop it!, they never should have even started it!, ohhhh!, ohhhhhhh!, why do they even have it?!, (no, ho, ho,ho,ho,ho, ho, ho, hoh), not this record!, this is a rock group!, this is supposed to be @ least something like rock!, from begin to end!, of all time!, to infinity!, ohh!, ohhhhhhh!, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! This entire cd is annoyingly boring, lazy, silly, weird, mellow, techno garbage; there are no nice songs or ballads here like radiohead always used to do since they began in apx '90 when they were coolest. If there was singing or some guitar work once, no one should care; it also sounds like flatline insolent mellow noise coming from appliances for a group that seems like they dont care anymore to apply themselves to what will always be the all around best music which are rock ballads or at least structured instrumentals-LIKE THAT YOU HEAR ON THE WEATHER CHANNEL'S LOCAL ON THE 8'S THAT SOUND LIKE U2 OR WHAT RADIOHEAD NOW SHOULD ONLY BE FINALLY DOING FROM THEIR EXTREME WAY OVERDONE \\"BEAT A DEAD HORSE\\" AMBIENT STYLE-WHEN I HEAR LOCAL ON 8'S FEW ROCK INSTRUMENTALS DESCRIBED ABOVE, I WISH/PRETEND ITS RADIOHEAD DOING IT. I WOULD THEN RAVE/BUY THE LP; OTHERWISE FORGET THE GARB THEIR DOING CUZ THEYLL ALWAYS BE MY ROCK BAND STILL-NEVER FORGET \\"JUST\\" & \\"PARANOID ANDROID\\" & ETC. . PEACE.   One uneventful person could lay all the dumb noise tracs on this cd without even embarrasing themselves totake this on the road as a group-(maybe RH wont). I see most of yall say this stuff sounds best when i.e. dining, working, traveling so then the silly sounds here are just pacifing: Nothing wrong w/ that & its the only good thing about this cd, if it doesnt drive u up the wall.

0765348276|4.0|A great setting with a wonderful blend of humor, technology and nice story telling, Old Man's War is a very enjoyable read. I have but one gripe: Perry and his friends act way too much like teenagers while still in their aging 75 year old bodies. Several examples are when they all pull out their PDAs, what they all name their BrainPals and the general interaction they each have. It's one thing to have one witty person in a group, but when they're all sharp as a knife smart alecks? It seemed like Scalzi was aiming to make these people the most down to earth, coolest, hippest 75 year olds you'd ever encounter.<br /><br />With my gripe out of the way and the story able to progress to this old man's war for the Colonial Union, you are treated to quite an intriguing story and an expansive, diversified universe. Haven't read it? Do it!
B0037VNX44|4.0|\\"Bronson\\" is based on the real life of a man often referred to as \\"the most violent prisoner in Britain\\".  \\"Charlie Bronson\\" is a moniker the prisoner (real name: Michael Peterson) assumed as a sort of stage name.  According to the film, Peterson desired to be famous and went about garnering that fame by perpetuating heinously violent actions against other prisoners and prison guards.<br /><br />The film is bloody, violent, disturbing, and incredibly effective.  Tom Hardy is a powerhouse in the role in every sense of the word.  He's an imposing figure to start.  His powerfully built wrestler's physique makes the improbabilities of his physical altercations believable.  He captures the audience's attention in a stranglehold of a performance, playing straight a role that could have easily turned into an insane human cartoon.  Instead we watch a credibly complex sociopathic character unfold who is apparently choosy about upon whom he will wreck his carnage (primarily the heavily armed and numerous prison guards).  His mirthless laughter at the beginning of the film puts the audience off-kilter, not quite able to regain balance until some time after the end credits roll.  You're never quite sure what Hardy's Bronson is going to do next.  He's so pitch perfect throughout the film, it's hard to take your eyes off this living disaster.<br /><br />The film is essentially presented from Bronson's point of view, which lends itself to some strange storytelling considering his sociopathic bent.  Some self-narrated fantasy asides are at first quite bizarre as they're occurring with Bronson telling his story on stage in full makeup.  There is a heavy dose of [[ASIN:B000HVI8GU A Clockwork Orange]]-style cinematography, especially when Bronson is committed to a truly bizarre mental institution.  Again, this could be interpreted as Bronson's views of the situation, not how they actually were.  There's also an odd measure of homo-eroticism in the film -- Bronson seems to attract the attention of gay men, albeit never has any semblance of romantic reciprocation -- and you'll see more than one fully nude shot of Tom Hardy's man-bits including a scene where he commandeers a male prison librarian to give him a full-body butter rubdown to make him more difficult to handle in the upcoming fight.<br /><br />I couldn't quite put my finger on whether or not director Nicolas Winding Refn finds Bronson to be a sympathetic character (a little off-putting in itself), but it's obvious that Refn is fascinated with Bronson's complexities.  One can't help but feel that Bronson deserves every last brutal beating he receives at the hands, feet, and batons of the prison guards, as he is presented as the exclusive instigator of each outpouring of violence.  The last image of Bronson, bloodied and confined in a solitary cage, whimpering like a wounded animal, is bound to stick with you for a while.<br /><br />Bronson is brutal, but fascinating to watch, walking a thin line that dispassionately presents a violent life without glorifying the perpetrator.  It'll most likely make you uncomfortable, but then again, how else would you portray a guy who wanted to get famous by fashioning the persona of Britain's most violent prisoner?en, albeit never has any semblance of romantic reciprocation -- and you'll see more than one fully nude shot of Tom Hardy's man-bits including a scene where he commandeers a male prison librarian to give him a full-body butter rubdown to make him more difficult to handle in the upcoming fight.

B005IUKWYG|3.0|The Last Colony offers some entertaining aspects, but overall it lacks the flow, intrigue and pull that both Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades had. The overall story builds to a seemingly impossible to resolve scenario, only to pull a trump card out of nowhere and suddenly things are a-okay. Cap it off with the \\"wait, what? how?\\" closing chapter of the book and I felt somewhat cheated. A decent book that lacks the ingenuity of its predecessors, The Last Colony is merely adequate in closing the series rather than being truly fulfilling.
B004KAB5QO|3.0|\\"I brought all of the new pictures with me.  I was in my London rooms too infrequently to leave anything of much value or interest there.  I placed the rest with ease but wherever I put the Venetian picture it looked wrong.  I have never had such trouble hanging a painting.  And about one thing I was adamant.  I did not want it in the room where I slept.  I did not even take it into the bedroom...in the end I left the painting propped up there, against the bookcase.  And I could not stop looking at it.  Every time I came back into these rooms, it drew me.  I spent more time looking at it - no, into it - than I did with pictures of far greater beauty and merit.  I seemed to need it, to spend far too much time looking into every corner, every single face.\\"  p. 20)  The painting in question is one of a Venetian carnival scene with gondolas bobbing in the oil-dark water, a lit up palazzi and a crowd of costumed revelers in black capes, tri-corn hats and those creepy, long beaked masks.  Anyone who gazes at it for a length of time seems to come under its malevolent power.  People appear and disappear on the canvas and bad things happen in real life to those under its spell.  Or is it the other way around?  I wanted to love this book.  And there were many things I liked about it.  It was short enough to read in an evening.  The small size was perfect for slipping into a purse.  The cover image, a detail from an Alessandro Longhi painting, appealed to the artist in me.  It had the right settings; a professor's apartment at Cambridge, a widowed Countess's lavish estate, a London auction house and, of course, Venice.  It had the right characters.  But it also had a couple of plot holes and some loose threads that were never tied up in a satisfactory way.  The first person narrative from each of the characters is effective, except that the most interesting characters are the ones you spend the least time with.  And, oddly, though their stories are compelling, you have little sympathy for them.  The Countess marries another woman's fiancee and seems bewildered at the resulting vitriol directed toward her.  The professor bequeaths a painting oozing with bad karma to a good friend.  A honeymooning couple becomes separated and can't find their way back to each other though they are both alive, in the same city and assisted  by the police in their searches.  A young woman falls over the brink of insanity (to the point where her family hires a priest to exorcise her), yet continues to attend and interact at various social functions.   Despite the dark hallways, cabinets filled with creepy curiosities, and multiple descriptions of terrified expressions on the faces of several characters, the story just wasn't scary.  Oh well, the subtitle said \\"A Ghost Story\\".  I guess I was hoping for more.  Or maybe it's that, after recently rereading Edgar Allan Poe's The Cask of Amontillado and the depiction of the sociopathic Montresor walling up Fortunado, brick by brick, row by row is so chilling little else comes close.  Unfair comparison, I know.  But what scares me about Poe is the detachment with which his narrators commit their acts - I'm thinking not only about Amontillado, but the Tell-Tale Heart.  They are so rational in their explanations, so lacking in empathy.    And that is truly terrifying.

Never quite appreciated them very much till now.  Ofcourse very adult movie.  The blood, gore, violence, fight sequences, Chinese element, Japanese element, music score (Ennio Morricone, all fantastic.  Writing, Directing, editng?  Well, Tarantino is Tarantino.  You do have to pay attention and not miss anything or you'll get lost real quick.  I did.  I had to go back and re-watched the DVD's.  V1 & V2 sort of connect back and forth.  Each section feeds from previous and feeds into the next.  Some things were really out in left field but the total product still delivered.  Just get past those things and the movie is still great.  I do not think the movie was intended to be totally based in reality anyway.  I think reality has a tendency to be too bland, blaize, and boring for entertaining movies anyway.  Get the dvd's and you'll keep them forever.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|The Tudors is a Showtime series about the infamous King Henry VIII. This is the king that had 6 wives because as he became dissatisfied with them he would get rid of them. King Henry VIII divorced the lucky ones and beheaded the unfortunate ones. The most interesting part of The Tudors is the battle that the religious reformers in England have with the Catholic Church. The reformers battle against the Catholic Church gave birth to the Protestant Movement. King Henry VIII created the Church of England because the Catholic Church would not give him a divorce. So we owe the way that many of us worship god today to a perverse king that just wanted a male heir that his first wife could not give him one. This series brings the history of the European reformation to light in a vivid way. If you are interested in how we got to where we are in terms of religion, or how royalty in Europe functions, watch The Tudors.

B00164KYV4|2.0|Ever since I was a child, my parents have always watched movies & series I've hated & never given me a say oe downvoted me on what we'd watch, even as an adult today. So as I was eating dinner with my parents today, I was basically forced to watch this.  There are too many characters & all of the women have (to me) the same personality, but with different needs & wants. Characters range from \\"desperate clueless naive whore\\" to \\"paranoid naive henpecker with mixed up priorities.\\" I don't actually know any women who ever felt like a man was a mandatory necessity in life, nor do I know any women this \\"girly,\\" so these women are strange & unrealistic to me.   I will give it points for the ending though; it's not really fairytale-romance-contrived & some of the women decide they want to be alone.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|I watched the old version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe with excitement. I was studying psychology at the time and a mentor gave me this movie to watch. Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe is like a great lesson on the emotional toxicity between a husband and wife. The main characters say and do things to each other that you will not believe, or maybe you will. By the way, the husband receives the bulk of the abuse. The couple corrupts another younger couple completely in a short period of time. The wonderful part of this film is how the main characters love each other no matter how much they rip each other apart, that and the surprise ending. Watch Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe to see exactly what I mean.
B005GVW05Q|4.0|Those who were lucky enough to catch Ryan Adams recent UK and US acoustic tours (the sweltering Oxford Playhouse gig was a superb performance*) will have seen the alt country troubadour in a quiet reflective mood. His new album \\"Ashes & Fire\\" accurately captures that ambience and is a genuinely lovely album full of strong songwriting and a number of potential classics. It's worth stating from the outset that this album is neither another \\"Heartbreaker\\" or \\"Gold\\" as the quality control across this new work is not as innovative or radical enough. Ryan Adams had \\"retired\\" from music for a number of years and spent much of this period sorting out his personal life and exercising demons so while Ashes & Fire represents a proper album if it has a template then it's the intimacy of 2005's largely low key \\"29\\". Whatever the case that overused term \\"return to form\\" is highly appropriate.<br /><br />It all kicks off with \\"Dirty Rain\\" which grows on every listen and is the sort of effortless alt country sung with the rich North Carolina twang which Adams should take a patent on. The excellent organ backing of the Heartbreakers Benmont Tench is a consistent and welcome innovation throughout. The title track of the album is alternatively the one real out and out country anthem alia \\"Jacksonville City Nights\\" but happily fits in the running order. The next two songs \\"Come home\\" and \\"Rocks\\" are lush ballads although the latter just about manages to stay on the right side of mawkish. Much better is the tougher \\"Do I wait\\" built on a classic chord structure and better lyrics, it's the type of song that will figure in concert performances and at some point Adams will no doubt \\"electrify\\" it, the same applies to the classy \\"Chains of love\\".<br /><br />Out of the five remaining tracks three in particular show that spark which previously made Adams the dominant figure in alt country. \\"Invisible Riverside\\" would have happily fitted on \\"Gold\\" and is a paean to his contentment with Mandy Moore the new Mrs Adams. He starts with the reflection \\"Guess I'll show my hand/Either way I'm losing/You still have the goods/Back when I couldn't use them\\" and builds it a gorgeous country lament. The single \\"Lucky now\\" is probably more in tune with the tradition of great songs on Whiskeytown's \\"Pneumonia\\" such as \\"Don't wanna to know why\\" and ably steered by the great producer Glyn Johns. Finally the albums closer \\"Love you but I don't know what to say\\" is one of Adams best love songs in a very long time and destined to be covered by all and sundry in the Nashville community.<br /><br />Ashes & Fire is an appropriate title for this album since it is mostly a languid slow burn with songs that gently reveal more on every listen. Throughout Ryan Adams is in great voice and this work demonstrates that real discipline which has been lacking in some of his previous work although the strange critical consensus in some parts that he ceased making great music after Gold is in the words of General Norman Schwarzkopf a load of \\"bovine scatology\\". In the last analysis this A&F is a very fine record that hints at even greater possibilities something which all connoisseurs of real music should celebrate and offer a quiet hurrah.<br /><br />* Should readers wish to hear a recent Ryan Adams acoustic concert his whole Denver gig is on the \\"I am fuel your are friends\\" music blog.ams.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|I don't think much more can be said about Angry Birds and its addictive nature. Its a fun little game that helps you pass the time during a long commute, random work lunch, or the like. Fun for me and my six year old daughter...

Good Movie to add to your collection. Thanks Amazon!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|This is Anthrax in top form. It's like \\"Persistence of Time\\" meets \\"Sound of White Noise,\\" turned up to incredibly  bad ass. It's the heaviest album Anthrax has ever done, and it's also their best. I know that sounds crazy, but it's true. And don't think I'm a new listener who doesn't know what he's talking about. I've been rocking with the band since I was a kid in the late 80s, and I've bought every one of their albums multiple times in multiple formats (cassette, CD, MP3). I love John Bush, and I think he was a great addition to the band, and I was skeptical when I heard Joey was returning. Don't get me wrong, Joey is a helluva singer, but I worried that after his last stint with the band (where he didn't want to record a new album) that his heart wasn't in it. Then there's the fact that \\"Worship Music\\" was written for Dan Nelson, and it had been sitting on a shelf for a few years. I assumed the entire effort was going to be half-assed, but I should have known better. It wasn't laziness that caused Scott Ian and co. to not write new music for their new/old singer, it was because what they already had was perfect. And I don't know what the album sounded like with Nelson, but it couldn't be as good as what they did with Joey. His vocals are on fire. He and the band sound better than they ever have, which is more than surprising -- it's insane.   Anthrax is unquestionably one of the most important metal bands of all time, and this is their crowning achievement. I firmly believe that decades from now, this album will stand as one of the band's most influential releases and a shining example of what metal is capable of. It's beautiful in it's brutality and unprecedentedly uncompromising in it's greatness. I'm not going to do a track-by-track breakdown, because the only thing to say is each song rocks. After the intro, the album kicks you in the face and doesn't stop. If you've ever rocked out to an Anthrax tune, or if you consider yourself a metal fan at all, you needto buy this album. Now. You will not be disappointed.

B004U52VPS|5.0|My son is 5 and loves the angry birds game on the tablet and computer etc.  I bought this because he loves to build things and create his own levels.  He loves this game and places with it every single day.  When we bring it down the shore the kids don't do anything but play this game.  Its durable and a lot of fun for the kids!!!
B005GVA2L0|2.0|Unfortunately, they can't match Fallen anymore, not even close. This CD sounds more like a pop group to me. Amy Lee has a beautiful voice but that is not enough obviously.. sad to see how they are going down the drain.

It's slow at first, but there's alot of setting up to be done. About midway through the film it really starts to get scary. I recommend this movie to any horror buff looking for a good scare. Just give it a bit.
B00000ADG2|5.0|THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER! EVEN THOUGH IT IS MORE TEN YEARS OLD,IT COULD STILL TOP CHARTS TODAY. \\"TIMELESS WORK OF ART\\". TO ZION IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD. THE RAW EMOTION THAT LAURYN SINGS WITH IS SOUL TOUCHING. IF YOU HAD IT BEFORE AND LOVED IT BACK IN THE DAY...BUY IT AGAIN! IT'LL BE JUST LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER HEARD IT! ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT LAURYN HILL DIDN'T MAKE MORE AMAZING MUSIC!

0380977273|5.0|I can't tell you how much this book has influenced my imagination. Ray is a true literary hero, an American classic. Everyone should be familiar with his work, especially this time of year =) For all Ray fans, make sure to check out THE OCTOBERS. It's a new book series that Ray would love. just go to theoctobers.com and you can see the trailer.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I just got done reading the book, you will NOT be disappointed!  The whole book has an awesome plot and a few surprises in it! However, you probably need to look on Wikipedia and look at the plots for the previous books so you can refresh your memory so you understand what is happening. The characters are fantastic as always! Percy is a major player in this book, but, there are others that are just as important as him, or, even more important.  I cannot wait until Fall 2012 for the next book.
B004NSULHM|3.0|TKOL is not so different from the last four Radiohead records: Deliberately eschewing the more pop-friendly groove sound they had back when they wanted to be popular for personal exploration. Some of the results are really good, but the rest sounds rather pretentious, even though I think the music really is the earnest result of their creative efforts.  Judging from the Basement videos, what's most surprising is that the effects (drum machines, synthesizer, processing and what sound like guitar loops) are actually played live in the studio! One of the drummers physically plays a drum machine, rather than programming it, and sometimes the old-school percussion is used as the trigger for other sounds. Echoes and other processing are added in real-time during the performance, rather than aftertwards, in the mixdown. But the end result on the studio release just sounds like the same old programmed shtick, which is unfortunate. I understand that they are studio wizards, but why not just use the natural sounds of the instruments? Or use computers and give most of the band the day off. I'm not hearing the advantage of human musicians here.

B005GVA2L0|4.0|It is a good album. At first you may not like it a lot but give it a few listens and more than likely it will grow on you. I would recommend it.  The only thing I don't like about it is the packaging. It is a double cardboard sleeve: for cd and booklet in one side and dvd in the other. Disks are hard to take out and they get scratched more easily than in a regular cd case.

1416955070|4.0|Hey so as you know in my Clockwork Angel review I said I would start reading TMI and just got around to finishing books 1-3 and debating if I'll read 4 because I didn't hear them many good review on book 4.But anyway excuse me if I start talking about books 2 or 3 because I can't exactly remember which things happened in which books.So let's begin I loooved book 1 great start it immediately draws you end.the Pandominum Club looove it.Also loove that it's set in New York.(SPOILER)my favorite part was when the turned Simon into a rat that was a great part and on my opnion the BEST scene or chapter in book 1.This is a great book I would recommend it to anyone 7/10 because the only down side is Cassandra Clare puts waaaay too much detail I mean it's goood so you can a visual picture but when it goes on for paragraphs and paragraphs and pages and pages it gets a little annoying a on some points I start skimming and scanning.And also the chapter are waaay to long I mean I don't like stopping in the middle of chapters but with these books I had too!But overall pretty darn good.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My 5 month old daughter absolutely loves this toy! She loves to scoot towards it and chase the lights and stare into the mirror at herself. The toy easily moves around on its wheels but it tips over really easy but she doesn't mind.

0385344325|5.0|I normally read 5-10 books at a time, half on the kindle, the other half in regular books. (Depends on the pricing. If the hardback is within $1-2 of the kindle, I buy the normal version so I can pass it on or donate it to the library. I also tend to avoid kindle purchases over $9.99.) With a big exception for the Lee Child Reacher series. I want it as quickly as possible and in as convenient a format as possible and I will overpay for the kindle edition. I also suspend my \\"serial reading\\" and settle in to his books for the duration.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />He is my \\"mind candy\\". The Reacher character is great, if a bit unbelievable at times, and the stories are suspenseful and clever and move right along. I have read each in the series but have to put this one near the top. A nice rebound from the last two which I felt were not up to the standard of the others.<br /><br />A good place to start for those new to the series. Once you finish this prequel, you will enjoy going back to #1 and moving on from there.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased this beast of a knife in large part due to the reviews on this website & numerous video reviews on the net.  It came from the factory very sharp.  First of all let me cover the positives I found.  I took this blade, leaving my trusted Marine Corps issued K-Bar at home out to the Croatan National Forest to put it through my own version of a \\"knife test\\".  I always select a recently felled tree to make a walking stick, and found a nice cedar limb to do so.  It was approximately 4 inches in diameter and took me about 20 strokes with the BK-2 to cut this limb in half.  The ability to trim & skin the cedar limb was simply majestic.  I found an old and abandoned deer stand that had fallen and began working on it (the framing was perfect to turn into a makeshift knife throwing target for my yard).  It had stainless steel bolts & such keeping it together, so once I cut the 2X4 ladder with the BK-2 (easy), and not having my leatherman with me, I utilized the extended pommel to beat & hammer these bolts until they broke off.  This by no means was easy, but it worked.  I had listened to many of the other reviewers already & had installed Micarta Scales prior to this trip.  One thing I did notice that was a little disturbing at the time, was that the top bolt closest to the blade came loose somewhat during the testing session.  I carried on however, and was able to baton wood without issue and feather stick some tinder for my fire making.  I modified it somewhat utilizing paracord to do so, but found the belt loop itself to be floppy & irritating; I also found it dulled the blade as other folks have stated.  I then did something I shouldn't have had to; I took some thin razor knife blades & scraped the interior of the sheath to create less resistance.  This worked but I am highly dissapointed in the sheath; too bad the BK-2 can't fit into the Bear Grylls \\"ultimate\\" knife sheath which I find is a superior sheath.  After my return home, I solved the loose bolt issue by removing the bolts & applying Loctite to the threads.  Now I'm afraid these scales will never come off..lol.  I highly recommend this knife itself, just wish the folks at K-Bar would listen to Ethan Becker who also advocates installing Micarta Scales.  The sheath just plain sucks.  I have ordered a custom made leather sheath from another maker other than Hedgehog Leatherworks (Cannot justify that expense).  If you don't mind spending an additional $80.00 or so for a better sheath & scales, I highly recommend this knife (hence the 4 star rating).  I have replaced my issued combat K-Bar with the BK-2 as my survival & bushcrafting knife which is a true testimonial; with the above stated modifications I now have a knife I can pass down through generations of my family.  Buy it but understand you will need to spend some additional funds. Update: The leather sheath I ordered sucked even worse; got it wet and was a pain to dry out (this sheath will most definitely degrade over time so..... Modified the original sheath by removing the floppy belt loop (Cut it off), Snapped off the rivets and attached a large Tek Lok.  This sheath is now excellent, with more than enough retention without the snap in belt loop.  Love my BK2.y removing the bolts & applying Loctite to the threads.

She has determined that their son should see their country residence and where food comes from (hint: meat does not spontaneously appear in the butcher shop), so Sam finds himself in a new and unnerving place; the rolling hills outside his beloved (and often beloathed, but it is HIS city regardless) Ankh Morpork.  But Sybil has arranged this sabbatical with Lord Vetinari (the tyrant of Ankh Morpork, and the most subtle and nuanced absolute ruler ever portrayed), so it shouldn't surprise anyone that the quiet countryside is full of surprises for Sam Vimes.<br /><br />In this, the latest chronicle of Discworld, we learn more of the intricacies of marriage (and if you are not yet married, \\"Jesters do oft prove prophets\\"), the belief system of goblins is expounded upon, the qualifications of a gentleman's gentleman are illustrated, the difficulties of life for the nobility, the diverse and fascinating world of poo, the influence of Dwarf substition (substition: a thing that is true, but not generally believed), the intimidation and menace wielded by an accountant, and the budding romance of Nobby Nobbs (Corporal, Ankh Morpork City Watch, and alleged human).

B005SZAEYO|4.0|America Horror Story does something amazing: it sets us up for - not just 90 minutes of thril, chills, and terror - but for hopefully what will be seasons worth of intrigue, the unexplainable, and the unfolding of a family of chaacters who bing their own dimension to the multi-faceted show. Good fun, lots to keep us guessing, womdering, and scared.
0385344325|5.0|\\"The Affair\\" is an intriguing story of Reacher's last mission in the Army and a peek backwards remembering the past, the reluctant hero. There is action but not quite as rough as past experiences as he lands in a small town in Mississippi at an army post where he meets the stunning chief of police. This was an enjoyable and exciting ride. I recommend!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I found this series at my local library and totally fell in love! What wholesome entertainment. I no longer watch TV because of the lack of good quality on the shows so I was delighted to find this program.  I only hope they will continue for more seasons.  I highly recommend it to everyone. Adults and children.

B001E45XT4|2.0|Okay well I will just say I took a gamble buying these knowing they were cheap ($23) and hoping for something worth much more. I figured since they weren't a cheap brand but not very huge like logitech I might find a hidden get....I was WRONG<br /><br />PC<br />Not to say I don't like these but they just feel like a large set of regular headphones. When I set up on my PC they connected and worked perfectly..except for the microphone. Although it has a cool and sound canceling design the pick up levels were so low that I thought it was broken until I boosted the mic levels.<br /><br />PS3<br />When I hooked it up to my PlayStation 3 the sound was slightly better but the bass still sucked(IMO) while connected through my samsung dvd player which is connected to the ps3 via optical wire and the quality just wasn't there.I haven't checked but the mic is completely useless if they ps3 doesn't allow for raising the gain for the mic.<br /><br />Overall Quality<br />Now the build quality seems pretty good not sure how long it will last though, only time will tell. It has an inline volume control which is pretty handy. The cushion is soft and comfortable for about 2 hrs. I have had about 15 or so hrs of gameplay with these things and after 2-3 hrs they start to bother my head each time and I constantly find my self repositioning they damn things to a new spot for comfort. W/o an amp these thing don't get very loud at all. And if your going to spend money to buy an amp you might as well use the money and just get something good in the first place.<br /><br />In My Opinion...don't get these unless you're a light gamer and want something cheap that will cancel noise out effectively.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games surprised me in many ways.  It is a brilliantly written, moving piece of work, made terrifying by how real it seems.  I felt guilty about how much I enjoyed going through the games with Katniss and Peeta, because doesn't that make me as bad as the rest of the Capitol people, glued to their tv sets to watch the whole horrible thing unfold?  The Hunger Games tells the story of Katniss, a 16 year old with way too many responsibilities.  She lives in the coal mining district of a changed North America, that has 12 disctricts, each one producing a different commodity, which is used primarily by the residents of the Capitol; who defeated the Districts in a long ago war.  Each year, to remind the citizens of the districts of it's power, the Capitol holds an event called the Hunger Games.  Each district must supply two 'tributes'.  the Tributes are children aged between 12-18 years, who will fight to the death in a staged arena.  There can only be one victor and the victor and their district are showered with wealth, food and gifts.  It's no huge surprise that Katniss eventually becomes one tribute, with a boy she barely knows - Peeta Mellark the other.  Together they prepare for the games, with some surprising strategies and help in the form of their stylists, and the only living victor from district 12 - Haymitch.  The story unfolds at a rapid pace after this, and in the spirit of keeping it spoiler free, I wont comment on the games themselves.  What I found enjoyable was the layering of character - the way everyone is playing one role, when they mostly need to be another.  The violence is shocking, perhaps all the more so because they are children, and it has haunted me since I finished the book.  The scenes with Rue moved me a lot, and thanks to the movie preview, I have a four note bird call stuck in my head.  The Hunger games was a fantastic read, and one that stuck with me afterwards for a long time.  Highly recommended.
140053271X|5.0|I think, the title sums up my opinion about this purchase good enough, but since I need to write 20+ words about it as well, here it goes.<br /><br />Putting some background, I don't have time nor money to purchase every book I want to read in paper, I find reading off the laptop screen impractical and uncomfortable because my laptop is too big to unsheathe it every time I want, while getting somewhere on a bus or a tram. And I'm not rich enough to buy myself an iPad :D<br /><br />So I was looking for a simple e-reader without bells & whistles, MP3, 3G, video playback capabilities and other stuff I won't use anyway, because I have an mp3 player for music, laptop for games, internet and movies, and I needed another piece of hardware to just read. Yeah, I'm all for \\"divide and conquer\\" and don't like combining everything in one :)<br /><br />Getting to the point - this device is just what I wanted. Text quality is great: \\"paper\\" is almost white, letters are black, just what I expected form the latest generation e-ink. The screen itslef barely blinks even without any kind of special protection (of course if you don't try to put it right under the lightbulb). Page-turning buttons could be a little easier to press (that's why I gave it 4 stars in \\"controls\\"), but who needs buttons, when you have a touchscreen anyway?<br /><br />What else? Well, controls are easy to learn, but in case you forget something, the user guide is already inside as your first available book. Easy to hold in hands, however I recommend you to buy a protective case for it to make your reading even easier and more comfortable. Requires wi-fi internet (b/g not n!) for activation when you turn it on for the first time.<br /><br />Wrapping it up - worth the money, does its job, good-looking. Buy it if you're in doubt =)

I've heard a few negative things which I can't understand because for what it is and what it offers, its incredible. The led tv is great because its probably the thinnest tv in the world and built in the case, and for 15\\" I mean come on everybody you have to remember it has to be portable which it undoubtably is. And for those who enquire on a shoulder strap, all I have to do to is put a snap on should strap on the side pad lock latches and away I go. If anyone has a duffle bag of some sort they come with snap on shoulder straps all the time. I think it is the best portable gaming device to date.
030788743X|5.0|Deftly written, engrossing, emotionally engaging and extremely reverential to the time period whence I grew up.  I loved this book.  I think it's especially compelling for those of us who came up in the 80's, but I imagine it would be meaningful for anyone who has ever lost a few hours (or days) in any sort of online game or community.   I read a ton and I'm RARELY compelled to write a review.  I *loved* this book.
B005LY3VRO|4.0|I'll say straight away that I'm not really a Britney Spears fan. At least, not anymore. She kind of lost me around the Circus album when it started to become evident she wasn't really interested in maturing as an artist or evolving beyond the \\"lets dance and party and pick up boys in the clubs even though I'm almost 30\\" mindset, which of course EVERYONE is doing these days anyway, which is very unfortunate. Being a fan of dance music in general I'll admit I love my share of mindless pop, but over the last few years it seems even Ms. Spears has been off her game. However, I'm also a remix whore (lol) so when I heard she was releasing a second \\"In the Mix\\" volume my curiosity got the best of me. As a collector in an age when the CD single is virtually defunct, releases like this can come as a real treat sometimes.<br /><br />So, putting my prior personal disappointments aside and looking at things objectively, is this a decent remix album? Yes, it is actually. Containing most of her major single releases since the 2007 Blackout era - though shockingly no version of her recent mega hit \\"Hold it Against Me\\" - I'd have to make the case that these remixes actually have improved upon most of the original songs. A lot of people say they don't care for remixes because of their repetitive nature and lack of structure, but considering her last two albums were basically nothing but looped vocals and random button mashing to begin with, the majority of these mixes almost have the opposite effect and strive to turn them into the sing-along pop ditties they were meant to be. Weird but true. Highlights for me include the Tiesto Club Mix of \\"Piece of Me,\\" which ventures into trance territory, and the Alex Suarez mix of \\"Till the World Ends,\\" which does the song a huge favor by giving it the distinctive melody line the original lacked. And \\"If U Seek Amy,\\" which I absolutely loathe in its original form, has been amazingly transformed into a pumping, 1980's roller disco anthem. The only two tracks I didn't much care for were \\"Radar,\\" because not only was the music itself generic and unmemorable, but the vocals were very quiet as if a true acapella wasn't available to work with, thus giving the impression of a bootleg mix; and \\"Criminal,\\" because it simply isn't different enough from the original to warrant being on this compilation. Plus it's almost too cheesy to bear anyway, lol. Otherwise, it's a solid collection that clocks in at just under 60 minutes.<br /><br />I realize this review, which is just my opinion of course, might come off as a kind of backhanded compliment, but in the end I really do favor this CD and definitely consider it worth repeat listening, hence 4 stars. I may be a little harsh on Britney herself sometimes, but I mean no harm. All I can say is, to sum it up, it might be in her best interest to recruit some of the producers who have contributed to these remix albums of hers and collaborate with them on her next studio album if she's interested in recapturing some of the fans, like myself, that have strayed along the way.cks I didn't much care for were \\"Radar,\\" because not only was the music itself generic and unmemorable, but the vocals were very quiet as if a true acapella wasn't available to work with, thus giving the impression of a bootleg mix; and \\"Criminal,\\" because it simply isn't different enough from the original to warrant being on this compilation.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen; truly.  Smart comedies involving sex are fine (see \\"Knocked Up\\" for an example) so that is not the issue. This movie is just bad. Very bad.  The jokes are crude, the situations are absurd and the approach to another culture is very patronizing. This movie does not embrace any purpose or meaningful storyline that I can relate to but if you believe that good sex and fashion are so critical they top family, meaningful relationships, and transcendent meaning/purpose, then this might be the flick for you. But even if that is the case, I suspect you will loose your lunch at the ridiculous notion that NY fashion is the real bridge between cultures (evident when the Muslim women whip off their burkas to reveal where their real eye for wear lies).  Not sure why I watched in the first place. Wish I had that 146 minutes back.
0812977246|5.0|I understand how this book must have caused one heck of a stir when it was first released.  Sure, it talks about the rot that permeated the USSR, but what it really does is provide a window into one of the most closed societies in recent history via an authentic and strangely sympathetic character.  Arkady Renko is a survivor and his story isn't the most pleasant one, but he refused to play the games swirling around him and concentrated on the murders that opened the book, making him the kind of stand-up person that's compelling to read about regardless of his being Soviet or not.  I can't wait to find the other books in this series.
B005HXGE9G|4.0|I loved this and think it's very well done, and am especially impressed with the instrumentals, which I may even like better than the vocal versions.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The price is really good. You can only get one battery in super market when you spend the same money. This battery model is very common and useful.
B00081912E|5.0|Quickly received. I was a hit with my grandkids when I purchased this. I had checked it out of library and they watched it several times and was sad when we had to return it. The look on their faces was priceless when they received their own DVD!

B0011UJMK2|4.0|I got this book for $3 in the bargain section at the B&N store.  What a value at that price.  A very good read that kept me interested from begining to end.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|As a huge Incubus fan, I adored this album. They are just a unique and powerful band with a wonderful message and strong lyrics that seem to grab you by the throat and empower you. I love it, love this album. If you have never experienced Incubus, this is a great investment in your musical life.

B002ZNJW0O|5.0|This is a true love story. So beautiful and heart-warming without making you want to vomit. Love it. I love the dynamic in this book, it is much different than some of his other stories. I encourage anyone to read this book, the movie blows.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I tried almost all of the top pdf readers out there on the Android market. This one tops them. First it doesn't crash on me. Easy to navigate between your documents. As a person that downloads lots of pdfs, it was nice to have a app that can view some big ones. Haven't had one problem yet.<br /><br />The one thing I loved the most is that it you are able to have the app read your pdfs to you if you feel lazy or if its your preference. It was awesome to just relax and have anything I have. Only thing that bothered me a little was that it would read the all the little marks like ;&quot;-/  and such. Kinda of annoying when it read a quote and it would say &quot;quote I am reading end quote&quot;<br /><br />Overall recommend it
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is amazing! I'm so glad I bought it.  I have listened to it over and over. I don't think there is one song on the CD that I don't like.  She's a timeless and extremely talented artist.
0312370849|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down. I finished it in 2 days. My heart breaks for Sarah and people who try to help her. I couldn't wait to see how things turned out. It ended differently than I thought it would. I read alot and this is one of my favorite books. Very touching. You will think about it long after you have read it.
B005E7AOHI|4.0|This is a great CD, full of wonderful tracks. I especially like HOINFODAMAN. Awesome reflection on modern society.  However, as many Primus fans know, a lot of their music is not meant for general consumption. Those who like radio-hits or \\"popular\\" music, will not find Primus appealing.  Welcome back Primus - I missed you!
0439813786|5.0|Before picking up this book, I'd heard some general buzz and a quick high level overview of the plot...an orphan boy lives \\"in the walls\\" of a Paris train station fixing the clocks and trying to fix up a little robotic man.  That was all I knew.  I finally picked the book up at the bookstore and my initial reaction was \\"Wow...this is big.\\"  The book weighs in at over 500 pages.  Knowing this was a children's book, this seemed a little daunting to me.  What I didn't yet realize was that about half of the pages were filled with illustrations.  This book is split about 50/50 between illustration and text.  The illustrations aren't just supplements to the text, but rather actually tell parts of the story.  Thus the book is part novel, part picture book / graphic novel.  I should also add that the illustrations are stunning and truly add to the book.  I absolutely LOVED this book.  As I read, I found myself not wanting to put it down.  And even before I had finished, I found myself gushing praise and recommending it to people.  In the same way that this book straddles formats, I find myself having a hard time categorizing exactly what makes this book so enjoyable to me.    From a high level, the story is cute and entertaining but not so amazing or remarkable to warrant outrageous praise in itself.  The art is fabulous.  It shows great talent and certainly helps to invoke emotion.  What stuck with me is the complex combination of beautiful images, simple yet lovely language, and a cute, emotional story.    The story and writing is humorous, fun and laced with intrigue and adventure.  The art allows for both fast paced scenes of action and slower scenes charged with  tension, love or other emotions.  I had a lot of fun bounding around the train station with Hugo or following him through the streets of Paris.    Without adding any spoilers, I must say that I absolutely loved the larger story being told here and the way it all came together.  The meta-story is further exemplified and enhanced by the artistic style and layout of the book in such a way that it made the larger story all the more real.  In the end, I felt like this book was an EXPERIENCE rather than just a book.  I came away with a sense of awe and wonder that I haven't felt from a book in a long time.  The art and the text wove an intricate spell that truly pulled me into the book and made everything seem real and amazing.  I will admit that this book will not be for everyone and certainly won't touch everyone in the same way that it touched me.  If you are willing to let yourself go and be immersed in a children's book, you should enjoy this.  If you're willing to remember the feelings and sensations of childhood, you may just find those emotions bubbling to the surface as you turn the pages here.  I whole-heartedly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  *****  5 out of 5 stars
0439023513|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy was probably the most brutal, terrifying, gut-wrenching, thought-provoking series I've ever read. Even if I hadn't pulled an all-nighter finishing Mockingjay (which I don't recommend), I probably still would have found myself sitting in the darkness of my room late at night, unable to fully grasp the pain and horror that I experienced through Katniss by the end of the novel.   I would not read this series looking for a light read, something to take to the beach or for a lazy afternoon. Begin this series only when you are ready for it. Have plenty of time set aside, because this trilogy will lock you in and refuse to let go. I finished both Catching Fire and Mockingjay in less than 48 hours. And be ready for the emotions that hit you, the shock, horror, pain, sorrow, loss, fear, confusion, hope, and even occasionally joy that Suzanne Collins so effortlessly weaves together.  I will say that I am glad that I read this book. It was not an easy journey, but it was refreshing to read a book that didn't focus on a plucky young hero who always says the right thing and gets to have a happily ever after. Although as a reader I was cheering for certain relationships and characters to pull through, I'm beginning to understand why they couldn't, and how that loss of a bond which had been fostered from the beginning made the message even more powerful. I don't quite get why Katniss made the final decision she did about the Hunger Games, but it will give me something to ponder in the upcoming weeks.  As far as Mockingjay goes, I think it was a fitting end to a powerful series. There were times when I found the cliffhangers at the end of almost every chapter a little repetitive or I couldn't fathom why a beloved character had to be so brutally destroyed, but then again, there aren't many books out there that could keep me reading about death and destruction for twelve hours straight. Questions were raised and storyline arcs were solved, slowly resolving Katniss's future in such a bleak world. This book has given me a lot to think about in terms of how we treat fellow humans and what the future holds for our children.
B004C43F52|1.0|I borrowed this eBook from my local library and read 60% of the novel before realizing it was not Louisa May Alcott's original, but a children's adaptation of the novel. This was not clear from the title of the book or the reviews provided by Amazon. Other customers' reviews referenced the fact that this eBook contains only \\"Part One\\" of Little Women, and not the second part of the novel, now considered its sequel, \\"Good Wives.\\" However, it should be noted that the Little Women story in this eBook is incomplete and does not contain the original text of the novel. Do not purchase this eBook if you are looking for Little Women - find an official, authentic version instead.

After enjoying the game for hours, I was horrified to find out my game save had been mysteriously deleted. All my progress - gone. Now when I do get the nerve to pay, it randomly force quits in the middle of a level, defeating the whole purpose. Will be 5 stars when this embarrassing company gets its act together.

It sharpens nice although it seems like if I dropped it, it would break instantly. If someone else is going to buy it for you or if you can get it cheeper then go for it but while it stays at $9 avoid buying it.

0393338398|5.0|Moneyball is a great book not because it crafts a vivid recreation of the insides of the Oakland A's front office, but also because it shares the facts with you in a story-like manner. For instance, everyone in the book was portrayed in a certain way, whether it be negative or positive. That alone made the people in the book seem more like characters and less like people, which is a major bonus if you're like me, and find most non-fiction to be too bland. The book's purpose was to bring sabermetrics out of the A's clubhouse, which was accomplished by explaining why the A's were winning with hardly any money, in baseball terms. Lewis gives the background on many of the major figures in the book, such as Billy Beane and Scott Hatteberg. This really helps the reader understand the way they acted during the 2002 season. There even seemed to be a certain level of refuting the traditional ways of baseball, not by the characters in the book, but rather Lewis himself. For example, in the last chapter, Lewis picks apart the arguments that Joe Morgan makes as to why the A's failed to win a playoff series despite winning 103 games in the regular season. In short, if you're interested in baseball, economics, or baseball economics, there is no other book around written as well and using an almost fight-the-system sort of approach that appeals to so many of us.

0307341577|4.0|Flynn's second novel is hard to put down, but it is not an easy read. Libby has lived a very inert life, living off of the money from well-wishers and publicity, including a book she wrote about her family's murder when she was a child. That money is running out. We follow a grown-up Libby Day as she is forced to relive the murder of her family in a somewhat selfish but self-preserving grab at some quick cash. At times her greed can feel quite slimy; I think this is a tribute to Flynn's ability to write characters. The story unfolds as Libby works to contact people connected to the murder on behalf of some groupies and amateur crime sleuths who think the wrong man, Libby's brother Ben, is behind bars for the murder. As we meet these people from Libby's past, we get a real feel for the ruralness of the area and the role models that helped shape Libby. The chapters are written from the perspective of Libby, her mother and her brother. The Libby chapters are present day, and the details of the past unfold in the voice of her mother and brother.
B002A4UE78|5.0|What more need be said about Yngwie's prowess on the guitar? Nothing. But some wonder why this album is so 'cheesy' and frankly the musician is Norwegian with all of that awesome folklore about trolls, Viking warriors, dragons, monsters & the like. Then couple that with Yngwie's classical influence particularly Bach and you get an offering where the songs are meant to take you into another realm where Medieval castles loom over vast kingdoms ruled by monarchs lusting for power.<br /><br />If such types of messages aren't your bag, then you won't appreciate this album. Oh sure if you're a guitar nut like me you may go, \\"Oh I love the arpeggio runs up & down the fretboard\\" but is that the sole reason to buy an album? Like many European metal bands, Yngwie has put out a few concept albums & this is one of them. Frankly, its' so fantasy oriented I've used it as background music for some old fashioned D&D role playing game sessions.<br /><br />I purchased this on vinyl back in the 1980's when it first came out & played it to death not only for the awesome technical playing Yngwie provides but also for the album's general theme. Queen In Love is my favorite track from this offering and the singing on this record is far better than the first couple of albums, \\"Rising Force\\" and \\"Marching Out\\". I even think the production quality is superior on this one but for pure instrumental inspiration, I have to admit that Yngwie's first album, \\"Rising Force\\" is IT for me.<br /><br />Funny but I could see maybe some royalty in Medieval times liking the music from this album. Yeah I know that's a stretch but I find it fun & amusing. \\"Magic Mirror\\" has me thinking Nostradamus is peering into his brazier of light trying to portend the future. The somber tone of \\"Dark Ages\\" evokes remorse at how many people died at the hands of religious persecution. \\"Fire\\" is an upbeat number that one could get up & dance to.<br /><br />In summary, if you're not a guitar nut (Yngwie has been called a musician's musician) and happen to like Baroque-esque inspired musicianship or you fancy the Dark/Middle Ages, then give this album a spin. Is it cheesy? Yes and cheese is never a bad thing! I rate this album 5 out of 5 stars for killer technical playing, atmosohere/feel & good vocals.oque-esque inspired musicianship or you fancy the Dark/Middle Ages, then give this album a spin.

The book was more exciting towards the end and held my attention - although the ending was kind of, 'eh'.  This is my second Connelly book and I'm not going to give up on him, but it didn't leave me with the urge to run out and get the next one like most Robert Crais books do.

B0029LB2V4|3.0|This series isn't rated tvMA for nothing. Go to Plugged In Online to see a review of content.<br /><br />The film was released for Showtime (a pay tv cable network) and thus has many scenes of violence (including decapitations), sex, and language.
1439153663|2.0|This one left me cold.  I could not find any empathy for the less than intelligent heroine who la-la'd through the book as far more interesting lives were destoyed around her due in great part to her inattentiveness to important events.  Her Gone With the Wind \\"I'll worry about that tomorrow\\" and lack of will all worked for her but didn't for me. Throwing sex, incest and other such dysfunctional issues into a novel does not a good read make unless they are or become something you care about.  I was constantly amazed that the co-characters found her actions forgiveable, I didn't.  If you are looking for substance and quality of writing, look elsewhere.

0307463745|5.0|I was only vaguely familiar with 37signals, but a colleague recommended this book.  It was a great read (listen, actually...got the audio version).  The principles are sound and their writing style is direct and to the point - exactly what is missing from most business books.  While some have given negative reviews for the authors not delivering new, paradigm-shifting wisdom, that's not what is needed in business.  Sure, paradigm shifts happen at times, but not often.  Why expect every book to offer some grand new insight?  Sometimes it's just having a reminder of the basics that matters most.  This book does a superb job at conveying important points about starting and managing a business.  If you're starting, this is a must read because it is clear and focused - two elements all starters could use a little more of.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|It's been five years since the last release of a project by Evanescence. It's an almost unthinkable amount of time in this day and age where if any artist doesn't turn out new music within a year of their last album they're forgotten. And it certainly hasn't been an easy five years for the group, either: line-up changes, centre-woman Amy Lee's personal life, and a year's work with producer Steve Lilywhite eventually set aside as Lee's eventual solo project rather than a band working have plagued the group. With delay after delay announced, it was questioned by many whether Evanescence was truly, finally finished.<br /><br />With the release of hard-hitting, defiant new single \\"What You Want\\", Evanescence has crushed that notion.<br /><br />\\"Evanescence\\" is not a comeback album at its heart; it is a rebirth of Evanescence. While Amy Lee's operatic gothic mystique remains the heart of the project, the group's synergy has never been stronger: Lee's vocals soar over the loud crush of guitarist Terry Balsamo's shredding; each hard-hitting song burns with the intensity of Tim McCord's bass; Troy McLawhorn's rhythm guitar keeps the music at a subtle flow from track to track; and Will Hunt's blistering drums build a furious foundation for the album. \\"Evanescence\\" is perhaps Evanescence's first turn as a true *band*, each part working together as a whole to build something new. Retaining both the moody gothic aura of \\"Fallen\\" and building upon the lyrical beauty of \\"The Open Door\\", \\"Evanescence\\" is both an evolution of the band's sound as well as a firm strengthening of the foundations of stone at the very heart of Evanescence.<br /><br />Opening with the brassy, defiant \\"What You Want\\", the band revels in its new, harder feel as Lee demands \\"Hello, hello, remember me? / I'm everything you can't control\\". It's an interesting tune that's almost arena-rock, both a call to the fans and also a new sound that's strangely *fun*. This segues into the equally strong \\"Made of Stone\\", a look at a failed relationship that is both hard-edged and freeing, recalling the elements of both \\"My Immortal\\"'s tragedy and \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\"'s kiss-off. Flying through the energy of \\"The Change\\", \\"Evanescence\\" really kicks off as the album's mid-section builds.<br /><br />\\"My Heart Is Broken\\" is a soaring, epic combination of Lee's trademark piano ballad and Evanescence's dark rock sound; it is sweeping and moving and the perfect choice as the album's second single. This moves into the wonderful \\"The Other Side\\", a song which builds on the high-energy metal of \\"What You Want\\" and pairs it with powerful lyrics about crossing that final divide to reunite with one that you love - in a fresh turn for Evanescence, however, it's not actually a depressing tragedy but rather like seeing dawn break. \\"Erase This\\" continues this theme and amps the metal up another notch, keeping the album flowing at a good pace.<br /><br />\\"Lost in Paradise\\" is the next to follow, an interesting tune that showcases more of Lee's pianist sensibilities than have been heard on much of the album; \\"Sick\\" is strangely eastern-tinged, bringing to mind the band's stomp-along approach to \\"Whisper\\" during the live production of the \\"Anywhere But Home\\" release. It's a strong track with a blistering tirade that relies more on the harshness of the chords, rather than Lee's darker snarl, to burn its message out. \\"End of the Dream\\" is the perfect echo of some of the darker lyrical musings of both \\"Fallen\\" and \\"The Open Door\\" (\\"As much as it hurts, ain't it wonderful to feel? So go on and break your wings / Follow your heart till it bleeds\\"), serving as a masterful entrance to the album's closing.<br /><br />\\"Oceans\\" is both a blistering rock track, one of Lee's most powerful vocal performances in the album, and lyrically one of Evanescence's best looks at the end of a relationship since \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\"; \\"Can't find the road to lead us out of this / A million miles from where we burned the bridge / Cross the oceans in your mind / In the end you never can / Wash the blood from your hands\\", Lee snarls as the band crescendos behind her, ending on a practically trademarked orchestral ending that is the perfect echo of the days of \\"Fallen\\". \\"Never Go Back\\" is a hard-hitting, haunting melody that is one of the harder tracks on the album, again recalling the album's oceanic imagery as Lee laments \\"Tearing us apart until it's all gone / The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves / But I'm the one who's drowning\\".<br /><br />\\"Swimming Home\\" is the album's closing, and true to form Evanescence provides a powerful closer. \\"Swimming Home\\" is one of the band's best ballads - tying together the imagery of the album before it, \\"Swimming Home\\" is at once a lament and a joyful exclamation, relying on electronica rather than piano or rock to guide it. It's almost the story of a mermaid fading beneath the waves to return to the dark depths, soft and tranquil and wonderful.<br /><br />The lush imagery of the ocean that the band drew its inspiration from is the perfect focal point for \\"Evanescence\\": it sucks one in like the receding water, drawing you down and then lifting you up like a cresting wave. While there are some filler tracks lost in the foam, it's an experience like surfing on that wave until crashing back to shore. It's a comeback for the band, an exploration of both roots and evolution of the original, and at its heart it is simply an amazing album, proving that Evanescence is once more worth the wait.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />DELUXE EDITION BONUS MATERIAL:<br /><br />The deluxe edition of \\"Evanescence\\" comes with four bonus tracks and an extra DVD. The new music kicks off with \\"New Way to Bleed\\", a hard-hitting metal ballad that's a firm echo of \\"The Open Door\\", again renewing that distinctive flavour when Lee and Balsamo compose together, while \\"Say You Will\\" and \\"Disappear\\" are both new approaches with \\"Disappear\\" especially recalling the strengths of \\"Oceans\\" and \\"My Heart Is Broken\\". The real stand-out of this material, however, is the ballad \\"Secret Door\\", which is perhaps Lee's most stripped since \\"Good Enough\\" as she once more lets go on the harp, an approach began masterfully in both \\"The Open Door\\" and Lee's haunting rendition of \\"Sally's Song\\" she contributed to the \\"Nightmare Revisited\\" collection during Evanescence's hiatus.<br /><br />The DVD is a collection of material that really can only be appreciated by a true fan of the band; other than the gritty comeback video for \\"What You Want\\", the DVD holds a plethora of behind-the-scenes looks at the band prepping for the video, for photoshoots, and interviews about several of the songs. It's a fascinating look at how \\"Evanescence\\" finally came together for its release.<br /><br />*The iTunes only deluxe version also carries another bonus track, the \\"Elder Jepson Remix\\" version of \\"What You Want\\", a remix which focuses on the hook of the chorus more than the song itself.<br /><br />**The Japanese edition of the album also features a thirteenth song on the album itself, the piano ballad \\"The Last Song I'm Wasting on You\\" that was initially released as a B-side to \\"Lithium\\" during the \\"The Open Door\\" sessions.<br /><br />Bonus Songs: 5 out of 5 stars; Bonus DVD: 4.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED:<br />Ben Moody and some of the original members of Evanescence have since rejoined to form their own band with a new lead vocalist; the project, We Are the Fallen released their debut album \\"[[ASIN:B003ENTMG8 Tear The World Down]]\\" last year.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|The entire album really engulfed me with a ton of emotions.  This is what I've been longing for and until now, Two Steps From Hell has fulfilled it.  There is not a single track that I do not like and I find that each track is worth every penny.  I highly recommend this album which makes any movie trailer extremely epic!
1439192812|5.0|Delightful and informative read, no matter how old you are.  Illustrations are stunning.  Learned several new things even though I have an advanced science degree.

0385344325|5.0|The Affair is premium Jack Reacher, but it's Reacher the investigator rather than the protagonist of slam-bang suspense.  The novel is a prequel to the rest of the series.  This is Reacher's last case as an Army MP Major.  In it we find out why he left the Army; we meet the object of his affections who participates in the affair to which the title refers and we receive some information concerning Reacher's brother, Joe.<br /><br />Jack is in rural Mississippi, doing a Mr. Outside/Mr. Inside number with another officer.  A woman has been found murdered and suspicions are pointing in the general direction of a military base which is supplying troops for missions in Kosovo.  As expected, Jack is prepared to solve the case no matter what fallout that solution might entail.  In the course of the story we will meet some toothless hillbillies, some unsavory militia types, an obnoxious senator and some Rangers assigned to take Reacher into custody and hold him incommunicado.  Good luck with that.<br /><br />The novel moves along briskly, but this is not a fingernail/cuticle biter; it's the story of an investigation.  Jack uses his fists, elbows, forehead and other lethal weapons, but mostly he uses his brains.  The love interest--a former Marine and now the local sheriff--shares her bed but also Reacher's interests in coffee and pie.  It's always nice to find Reacher in a romantic relationship, as long as it doesn't distract him from the serious business at hand.  Here, it doesn't.<br /><br />This is a worthy addition to the series; don't miss it.<br /><br />p.s. I'm still trying to imagine Tom Cruise playing Reacher.
B004Q8FTE4|3.0|I wish you could have 3 & 1/2 stars, because that is where I'd really rate this set. What's bad about it ? Well, the confusing and dull narrative of \\"Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking\\", and the relentless angst of \\"Amused To Death\\", for starters. Eric Clapton and Don Henley do some great work as guests, but these two records are likely to leave you cold. \\"Radio KAOS\\" is a little better, still with a baffling storyline, but it has some groove and some better written songs. So, pick and choose your way through these three studio records. You'll find a few tracks that work and some that bore you. What's good ? The live concert \\"In The Flesh\\" CD and DVD are both terrific, even with some slow spots provided by material from the above mentioned records. He has an ace band, featuring Doyle Bramhall, Jr. on guitar and vocals, and they reel off Pink Floyd classics in substantially different versions from their post-Waters Pink Floyd counterparts. But Waters is a great live performer with an eye for humor and his usual spate of dire political commentary. Sure, you could just get the \\"In The Flesh\\" DVD and CD and leave it at that, but you'd miss the spectacular opera \\"Ca Ira\\" that Waters has composed and produced. If you go for opera, and I rarely do, you'll find \\"Ca Ira\\" a little heavy, but enjoyable. If you cannot abide opera, you'll have no use for it. Amongst the studio records, there is enough for me to like to want to own them, and \\"In The Flesh\\" and \\"Ca Ira\\" are both superb, in my opinion, so the box set is for me. May not be for you.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I am so glad to see Evanescence return w/ another album. It's about time right? Their last one came out in 2006, but welcome back your fans missed you guys. I passed on downloading the lossy songs and picked up this 2 disc CD/DVD deluxe version instead. If you're curious if it's good, I'd say it's classic Evanescence, so go buy yourself a copy. I do wonder why the band couldn't come up w/ a name for it. Mrs. Hartzler wonderfully handles the vocals as always, everyone loves her singing, she is amazing! If you liked their earlier albums I think you'll like this. My fave tracks are numbers 1,3,4,7,11,13, & 16. Personally I wish the songs were longer than the typical 3.5 - 4.5 minutes (most are under 4), but that's the bands call not mine. One minor gripe, I am not crazy about the fingerprint magnet paper case, that makes it hard to remove the discs from the center w/o putting a fingerprint on the disc to pull it out. I don't know maybe its just me. I like the album cover but it looks very similar to The Silent Force (2008) by Within Temptation. In closing, I'd recommend this album. The total play time is 1:01:43 and the band's website is : evanescence.com<br /><br />Thank you Terry, Tim, Troy, Will, and Amy for giving us the rock album of the year. Well done.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am not usually a fan of fantasy - but this was exceptional. The author truly breathes life into this book. It may be the best written book I have ever enjoyed. Read it - you will not be disapointed.
B0056BU3I2|4.0|It may be the best in the series...so far. This really is an ultra macho action movie. Good chases, fights, shootouts, and of course extremely expensive ultra fast cars doing all sorts of crazy things (amazingly w/ very few pedestrians or traffic). They blended a lot of the actors from the previous movies into this one. I enjoyed the Rock's character (Luke Hobbs), he played a real bad ass here and Vin as always plays the group's leader, the deep voiced, muscled up tough guy Dominic \\"Dom\\" Toretto. This film really makes the police in Rio de Janeiro look foolish and corrupt. Do they really drive those suped-up dodge charger police interceptor cars there? Somehow I doubt it. Apparently every city has an underground race club behind fences w/ hot girls that race thru the streets for \\"pinks\\" (a car's title). I don't know, I never see them. It's interesting they named the movie fast five rather than the fast and the furious 5. Anyways, it was a good action \\"guy movie\\". The downtown streets & bridge scene w/ Dom & O'Conner is killer. The guy who played the bad guy, Joaquim de Almeida, was also very good in his role. Very cool ending as well, although I wish they showed the final race instead of cgi everything. If you watch past the first few seconds of the credits they show a teaser for the next movie (scheduled may 2013) where apparently Michelle Rodriguez's character \\"Letty\\" is alive, Eva Mendes' character returns as well.

B005MMYCY6|5.0|Whoa.<br /><br />Just saw Hesher... Below is my spoiler-free review.<br /><br />Hesher is not a movie I will ever forget... With so many cliched films vomited through my brain, I can guess most of the outcomes of scenes and rarely get surprised anymore. The first time a movie or shot does something different it's surprising to you like the first time you saw the shot of the passenger looking directly at you as a incoming car slams into us! However the second time is not so surprising because you think, `Oh yeah, saw that same shot on Lost.' Years later, the shot doesn't even faze me or spark an adrenaline jolt anywhere near the first time.<br /><br />What the hell does that have to do with Hesher?<br /><br />More than I could have hoped for... It has been years since I've been so surprised by a film. (he last film that surprised me on this scale was The Dark Knight. Actually there's one other film that falls into this category and that's Trollhunter.<br /><br />Shut up and tell me what kind of surprises.<br /><br />Gnarly stuff happen. Stuff I've never seen on screen.<br /><br />Good or bad?<br /><br />Both. This film has brutal parts man. But it also has some of the most hilarious/dramatic moments that had me laughing or gripping the sofa on how uncomfortable or heartbreaking some scenes were. It's not a film that will have you feeling goody all through, it likes to rope the viewer around on the emotional landscapes of the human condition, from loss, sorrow, heartbreak, love, betrayal, friendship, forgiveness, dependence, and anarchy.<br /><br />Anarchy?<br /><br />Lots of it. Stuff I've never thought of before. Hardcore fights. Kids too.<br /><br />Cut to the chase. Is it good?<br /><br />The one thing that really pains me about this film is that it could have been one of the greatest films ever.<br /><br />What? So it's just okay?<br /><br />No! It gets 88/100 on my scale. Very few films get past 80 and even less to 88... what I'm meant is that if they took another stab at editing it they could have made it shorter at some parts and maybe longer at other places because the pacing is difficult to swallow at places.<br />Editing is an artform that has the curse of never reaching perfection, only deadlines. Every single film out there can be better with more editing. I know that's a conversational statement but I have not met one seasoned editor who didn't agree.<br /><br />In conclusion, Hesher is a uncomfortable film. It is also an amazing film but it undeniably feels like an acquired taste. What I mean is that it's definitely not for everyone. (Violent with children, Strong language, and nudity)<br /><br />Here's my favorite quote, come back after watching it and then you'll remember why it was funny<br /><br />\\"You know snakes are named that because of the shape of their bodies.\\"<br /><br />Above is an excerpt of my review over at artofthestory.comllow at places.

B002JVWR4A|5.0|received well with in the time given. Arrived in condition Promised (NEW) very happy with my purchase.Will be getting the sixth season soon.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|I'm keeping this review/rant spoiler-free because most of you probably have never heard of this film and that's a damn shame.<br /><br />I cannot remember any other film that made me laugh out loud several times but still cringe in fear at certain parts. This kind of balance is extremely difficult and rare, the only other example I can think off the top of my head that effortlessly alternates from comedy to drama is Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.<br /><br />Did I just compare Trollhunter to one of our greatest masterpieces of all time?<br /><br />Hear me out first.<br /><br />When I see a movie like \\"EPIC movie\\" (I was on an airplane ok, nothing else was on) I don't laugh. Everyone from the writers and actors are trying too hard and it's blatantly obvious. Trying too hard isn't the biggest sin of that film.<br /><br />What truly cripples `EPIC movie' and other cheap comedies is that they don't give any weight to the story. The film was created solely to make people laugh but in the absence of story it fails.<br /><br />Trollhunter and every Pixar film puts story first and foremost.<br /><br />In a interview about `UP', Pixar mentioned that they had to cut so many jokes or gags out because their philosophy is that if the joke/gag does not serve the story it does not have a place in the film... talk about hardcore.<br /><br />I love the irony of it. `EPIC movie' tries to jam as many jokes they can in the running time when films like `Trollhunter' and `UP' manage to make us laugh harder but with only a few well-placed jokes.<br /><br />Shakesphere knew this when he wrote Romeo and Juliet. A few key jokes within the framework of an incredible story will always trump cheap comedies packed with too much jokes. (My favorite line will always be, \\"Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man\\") Think about your favorite comedies, do they have a good storyline?<br /><br />Some of my top comedies include, `There's Something about Mary', '40-year Old Virgin', `Punch-Drunk Love', `I Love You Phillip Morris', `Anchorman', `Best in the Show', and `Trollhunter.'<br /><br />Maybe `Anchorman' seems more like the flavor of EPIC movie but it somehow pulls through with an original story set in 70s San Diego that we have not seen before.<br /><br />Isn't this supposed to be a review of Trollhunter? Yes... however I saw the film without seeing any trailers or reviews and promise you that this is the best way to enjoy this masterpiece.<br /><br />If you're the kind of person that is getting jaded by the lack of originality out there then this film must be viewed before you complain about the bleak future of cinema... I don't think we're making worse films, I think there's just more and more terrible movies released so it's harder to find the gems under all the crap.<br /><br />Go see Trollhunter. It's a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />***above was an excerpt of my review over at artofthestory.com ***nchorman' seems more like the flavor of EPIC movie but it somehow pulls through with an original story set in 70s San Diego that we have not seen before.

B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Few albums grow on you year after year, but this is one.  Not a fan of Bob Marley initially, a roommate played it regularly.  I got to know the album, learned to appreciate its message.  A few years later, I finally bought a copy.  Every year since I have become more fond of Marley, his music, and his message, and along the way I've converted many \\"haters\\" to love him as well.  One of the greatest albums of all time.
0553386794|5.0|This is an incredible achievement. Not a moment of slack--a work of pure perfection. Thrilling, engaging, miraculous--from start to finish. The sheer depth of the characters, the width of the story, the height of the emotion, is breathtaking.<br />Though I have read fiction all my life, and written 11 novels of my own, I have never read anything quite like this. This novel is on a par with Tolstoy's \\"War & Peace\\"--the only thing I can grasp that comes to this level. Just an amazing thing to have read. I will never be the same.

B005JLNALG|3.0|At least that's the feeling I got after listening to Road Salt Two for the first time. And that's to be expected. This is, for those of you who haven't realized it yet, Road Salt \\"the Second\\". In many ways it's exactly like its predecessor, only different.<br /><br />Let me explain: the songs on Road Salt Two can basically be broken down into two categories, songs that sound like Road Salt One songs, and songs that don't. The first category, which represents the majority of the album, is broken up in two subsections: retro-sounding faux \\"classic rock\\" songs that could have been on the first Road Salt album (i.e., Mortar Grind, Conditioned), and apparent \\"reworkings\\" or otherwise alternate takes on Road Salt One songs (Of Salt, Break Darling Break). The second category, by far the better of the two, sees Pain of Salvation breaking off into completely new territory (To the Shoreline).<br /><br />The songs of the latter category are easily the best the album has to offer. \\"Healing Now\\" and \\"To the Shoreline\\", for example, see Pain of Salvation jumping into a folk-rock oriented direction that they've only hinted at in the past with songs like \\"Imago.\\"  The big epic of the album, \\"Physics of Gridlock\\", is a closer that is right up there with \\"The Perfect Element\\", \\"Enter Rain\\" and \\"Beyond the Pale\\", and features some of the best lyrics in a Pain of Salvation song yet. In fact, for the most part, this is one of Pain of Salvation's strongest albums lyrically. It is a vast improvement over the last two records, and seems to be a bit of a return to form for Daniel.<br /><br />Now, for the bad.<br /><br />Aside from the exceptions noted above, most of the album is made up of the Jesus Christ Superstar-flavored rock that was cool for one album, but not necessarily another.  \\"Softly She Cries\\" and \\"Mortar Grind\\" are both flairless songs which seem like they didn't make the first Road Salt album for good reason. And \\"Conditioned\\" takes Pain of Salvation's obsession with the 60s and 70s to the point of self-parody: upon hearing this song, fans will have themselves wondering if Daniel Gildenlow has been possessed by the allegorical ghost of Lenny Kravitz's dead celebrity status. The songs which sound like other Road Salt One songs are generally not as good as the original versions heard. \\"Of Salt\\" is nowhere near as compelling as \\"Of Dust.\\" \\"1979\\" seems to be melodically the same as \\"Sisters\\", but that was one of the best songs on Road Salt One and \\"1979\\" is just in the middle of this batch.<br /><br />Further bringing the album down is the production. It was bad on the first record, but this time it's a little bit worse. Once again, everything sounds paper-thin and dead, except for Daniel's vocals, which are ironically crystal clear and full of life and were no-doubt been recorded with great care for detail. Unfortunately, this album shares the same lo-fi, cardboard sound as Road Salt One while introducing a slew of inexcusable sound issues. For starters, the sound clips out the wazoo this time, which is a problem that the first Road Salt didn't have, making it sound like your speakers are being blown out or damaged no-matter what volume you're playing the album at. At this point you've gotta wonder whether Daniel Gildenlow is trying to fight the loudness war, or simply trying make a \\"quiet\\" record that still suffers from all the same problems with sound clarity and clipping that \\"loud\\" records are said to have.<br /><br />I've complained about this record a lot, but I will say one thing: as a whole, Road Salt Two sees the band reaching the end of one perhaps over-tread and worn-down road and promises a departure into new, hopefully more exciting, areas. I guess as fans who've stuck with the band through the last decade that's about the most we could ask for.<br /><br />I give this album a generous 3/5 stars.upon hearing this song, fans will have themselves wondering if Daniel Gildenlow has been possessed by the allegorical ghost of Lenny Kravitz's dead celebrity status.

0062060554|4.0|Christine wakes up in a strange bed, with a strange man, every day. What is worse, she has to face a woman she has no memory of: herself, in the mirror. A traumatic head injury has caused Christine to forget her daily life and most of her past twenty-five years. Each day is faced with pictures of the past and present, with her husband Ben explaining what is going on, with the knowledge that it will all be gone in the morning and she will have to begin again. When a phone call from her doctor brings her journal back into her hands, Christine begins a journey towards discovering what she has forgotten may not be as important as what she is not told to remember.<br /><br />Watson does a terrific job of telling the tale from Christine's perspective. As much of the book is relayed through her journal entries, we start over again with the same forgotten - or in some cases, remembered - information that is touched upon again and again. The reader does not become an observer, but participates in each day's revelations, whether new or repeated. The suspense builds not only from knowing what has already happened, but not knowing what the next morning will bring. Having a life on a continual loop would try any person's sanity and I suffered along with Christine as she tried to put together a puzzle that was missing so many pieces. While some may be able to pull the clues together before the end, there are enough twists to keep all the answers from being revealed until the last moments.<br /><br />S.J. Watson's suspenseful debut will keep readers enthralled.

B005AUWY90|5.0|Wow, didn't realize people expected another Piston Cup race movie starring Lightning McQueen where it would have been a given that he would have would have won; but it's called Cars...meaning more than just Lightning McQueen.  To me this movie shows that there was more to this world than just racing, and that Pixar/Disney (whoever) could make other action adventures involving more than one car.    All my kids (age from 9 - 4) saw it and loved, and can't wait for the disc release.  I wish I could save it for a Christmas gift but to avoid them bugging me for 55 days for it, I may need to get it on its release date.
0199747431|5.0|This is a highly informative work that very uniquely combines a largely academic approach but in a very engaging and easily readable format. For those that approach the study of terrorism from an academic perspective this will come as a very pleasant surprise!  Written primarily from a social psychology standpoint but borrowing sometimes from Social Movement Theory (in particular Donatella Della Porta and her work on Italian and German leftist terrorism) FRICTION presents 12 different pathways to radicalization into terrorist activity. The authors present these 12 pathways (grouped into three layers much like Della Porta's Micro, Meso, and Macro levels) in a series of explanatory vignettes using the 19th century Russian leftist terrorist group People's Will juxtaposed with a modern example primarily but not exclusively drawn from Islamic terrorist figures.    In harmony with other recent academic findings, the authors underline the varied nature and goals of terrorism and terrorists by demonstrating the various pathways that can lead individuals to commit violent political acts. Particularly noteworthy are the number of pathways to violent radicalization that could be said to be non-rational in that they are responses neither to ideology nor to political exigencies, but rather to combinations of sometimes subtle social factors such as group dynamics, boundary hardening, and even love. Also in keeping with most modern scholarship on the topic, the authors reject psychopathology as a factor in political radicalization.  This is not a social science work -- the presentation of the 12 pathways appears to be exploratory based on a broad literature review primarily from the social psychology realm. As such, topics such as Political Opportunity Structure are not addressed. Perhaps most unfortunately, a topic I would think social psychology would be well equipped to handle, de-radicalization, is also not addressed.  Overall, a fantastic work.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I adore Mia so expected this to be a fresh take on the oft told story.  Im afraid that it just does not hold a candle to the smoldering passion of the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg.  While the cinematic technique of telling the tale in flashbacks lends a freshness to it, the story was bland.  There was no energy to Adele, Rochester came across snarly rather than tormented, and the conflict of poor Mrs. Fairfax was glossed over.  The visuals however were stunning.  On the whole, I say rent it, dont buy it.  Especially since the special features were short, pathetic trailers.  Very disappointing-it would have been great to see some real interviews, learn more about recreating the period, etc.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|With the exception to \\"Swimming Home\\", this Album Rocks! It's a lot more heavier than The Open Door, not to say the open Door wasn't good, but this album has  that extra kick to it.
B000002KET|5.0|I never used to like it but after several listens it got better, it wasn't like Paranoid how I liked it at first and it's always going to be a classic. SBS took time and it's not their heaviest album, lighter than their first 4 releases. The songs are very complex and progressive, less accessible than their early albums. It's also their first to feature synthesizer which changed their sound a lot but it's still a very quality album. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Sabra Cadabra, National Acrobat and Killing Yourself to Live are the best.

B00125WAWS|5.0|This movie is an excellent historical reminder of African-Americans' fight for their rights.  The fact that it is done through organized debates and also shows the suffering of the African-Americans, it leaves one feeling satisfied at the outcome, yet sad for the pain and suffering of so many.  I used this to show my students of debate.  It has some excellent debate form for teaching what debate is all about.
B004R6CGXM|5.0|If this CD was only half as good as their first, it would still be worth twice the price!  Buy it! It's a new adventure with a lot of past and present all rolled up in one fun musical journey!  AND it's all originals(I think)....great sophomore release. I've had their first one for awhile and play   it for anyone lucky enough to be within 'earsight' and people still call and text wanting to know the name of  the band I was playing at some pool party I had in my backyard this and last summer. I've been a rock'n'roll DJ  for over 40 years and Kitty Daisy and Lewis are a most welcome addition to my musical menagerie.  I sincerely hope you'll check this out and if you're not interested then check out \\"DIG\\", their first CD.  You will be happy!!!
B005HXGEDC|3.0|When it has came down to Peter Gabriel over the past several years, it has been more like a enigma in his course for branching out in his music. Sadly, he hasn't had that spark and that charm that made him so innovative during the 70's when he was a part of Genesis, and his brilliant solo work in the 80's and 90's. He wasn't even there to celebrate with his ex-bandmates when Genesis was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Musically, he has made experiments in other things than just making music to call his own. It hasn't really brought out any new listeners, and his latest project doesn't seem to spark what he did as unique. More like a re-wiring of his imagination.<br /><br />New Blood, Peter Gabriel's latest album tries to re-work some of his classics from his lengthy solo career to a whole new generation. Sadly though, it feels like a whimper than something exciting. Like what Sting had last year with Symphonicities, Peter tries to work his solo works up with a mixture of orchestral moods and melodies. He blends in with his classics like Solsbury Hill, the dark and dormid Mercy Street, and the eclectic Red Rain. Most of the tracks sadly feel more like a shell of themselves musically, and don't try to ignite what made Gabriel stand out on his own. Not only that, he also overshadowed some of his biggest hits for the album. It would've been a better stand out if he included his smashes Sledgehammer and Shock The Monkey in a new light. But, they aren't even a part of the package at all. Few songs if any stand out well, but otherwise it feels like the bow has lost its strings in the middle of the G-string on the cello.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't find what I wanted to hear on New Blood from Peter Gabriel. While he did offer a new twist on his classics, it just didn't work out in my ears. If you're new to his music from his solo era, this is at all not a must buy for your music collection. Instead, I would recommend his 2003 greatest hits compilation Hit or Shaking The Tree: 16 Golden Greats as a better bet. New Blood didn't make a great cut in my heart from Peter Gabriel, and it is more than a sledgehammer that didn't break the ice that was meant to be broken.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C-<br /><br />Price: D<br /><br />Mastering: D+<br /><br />Overall: C-Golden Greats as a better bet.

B0000247OZ|5.0|I'll never forget listening to this album when it first came out, as a drummer at the time being \\"blown away\\" by Billy Cobham's incredible performance.  I can't think of an album released since Inner Mounting Flame that can rival it's incredible intensity and complexity.
B004L79VUI|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I just find this lastest release from Robbie Robertson to lack depth.  Musically it is great.  Lyrically, it leaves much to be desired.  And where is the grit in Robbie's voice?  It's almost like he's trying to create an album of pop standards.  I've always felt that Robbie operates much better within the context of a band---perhaps THE Band if you'll pardon the pun.  If it is great solo stuff from a member of The Band you are looking for, try Levon Helm.  I found nothing memorable on this release.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Sure it has violence and is not for younger childrens viewing.   However, the violence may be a lesson and discussed with older children.

B004LWZW4C|1.0|I have received a second shipment of this BD and it does not play either,  Roxio Cineplayer freezes completely on both copies of this Fox disk.  None of my other 30 odd bluray disks have any problem playing, in addition  I have two separate bd disk drives on my computer and both do the same lock  up on this Fox XMen First Class (note that both drives are up to date on  firmware and they are different makes, one is Samsung and the other is  LG).  Not sure who is at fault but I'm certain it's not my computer or both drives  as they work for so many bluray.  And it seems remote this could be Cineplayer  as well.  I'm guessing anyone trying this bd on a computer will find the  same results.  Also I found the \\"digital copy\\" is worthless as it is lower resolution than  I would ever watch, it's not even 480p at 720x306, far below what I paid  for and wanted to see, after all it's supposed to be bluray (1920x1080).
B005D51JQQ|1.0|The real problem is the excess cost.!  On cds you can purchased used for $1.00 or less  And I purchased all cds used .   I don't wasting alot,  of money on something I won't like later  That said there is no reason for this universal for doing this.  They screwed up Queens remasters.! Lets screw, with Sting's music.    Not saying Sting is bad artist he is talented  to a point, I don't dig every cd he's ever came out with  I am more a fan of Robert Palmers .  Over his entire career he came ot with a total 16 cds  Robert really took chances.  Sting sometimes is kinda like a slow wave in the ocean.  Universal should get out of the music business.  Because you F.U.B.A.R so much already
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|Love the game, hate the bs full screen video ads.  I don't like the I'm game ads that block the upper right, but I can deal.  The video ads that crash the game, however ruin the game.  I can live with ad supported free games, but not when it breaks the game.

0938045695|1.0|Check my reviews out an you'll find you have to go out of your way to get a bad one from me. This book is incredibly poor. You'll find more exercises in the little $9.95 book you can buy from most around the corner general sports stores or get for free on line. I thought I'd try this author out to see what new things he might offer. That's easy...ZERO. The book is full of the authors bull and lots of ads for his other products. Reading this book makes you feel like talking to a MLM operator who promises big up front just to get you to come to some more expensive meeting. UGH! What is down right intolerable is the continued reference to the author's \\"Russianess\\"...Okay, I get it...You're Russian. But what does that have to do with good kettlebell technique? If you took the kettlebell exercises out of this book you'd be hard pressed to come up with 20 pages. The only reason I give the book a star is that the few techniques included do emphasize safety. It's really easy to hurt yourself with kettlebells so I acknowledge the author's responsible handling of that matter...too bad he didn't put more effort into turning out a quality product. Get [[ASIN:0615275303 Steve Cotter The Complete Guide to Kettlebell Lifting]] It has 190+ exercises and all the correct and safe moves with lots of full color pictures AND it comes with a DVD of all the exercises. Cotter's book achieves what you want...how to do the exercises

B005D0RDIE|2.0|Just played the blu-ray version on master audio via my oppo, wow what a step backwards from the much more dynamic Snakes & Arrow blu-ray. Not shure what happed as most of the same people who did S&A did this recording, except that Alex was Not involved in the mix of Time Machine. The recording lacks dynamics, air, and the detail.  If S&A was the 2nd row vantage point sonically, Time Machine is row 57. Neil makes sounds w/o impact or dynamics, his set sounds glazed over, processed & compresed & distant.  However Alex guitiars sounds good and retains dynmaics & edge.   Cant recommend given the much better sounding S&A  made just a few yr ago, it also has better non moving picture song selection than time machine.   What happeded from a audio production standpoint?. Does anyone know? . video ,who cares rush was never a visual band & I would trade off a bad video production for better sound quality any day.  Rush time machine tour was highlighted by playing the entire Moving pictures record, which was the main draw for many of  the die hard fans who finally had a chance hear the camera eye & vital signs, which are some of rush's best songs but rarely played since 1982 live.  Unfortunately inorder to get to the best part of the show fans had to endure awful songs like bu2b & faithless, leave that thing alone, stick it out & other questionable selections. At the same time no songs were played from P/G and one song from power windows.     However the torture will not need to be repeated on the blu-ray as fans can now FF over the dreck to the good parts of the show, and since they just released S&A blu-ray a few ys ago one can combine the two into one real best of show.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Lovin this app. Great fun and works right out of the box. Would be 5 star but 2 flaws. No support for FFC and does not use cameras digital zoom function. Otherwise, a very fun and creative app. I d/l when it was the AotD, but it is easily worth then $1.99 asking price. HIGHLY recommend.<br />HTC Thunderbolt.
1439170916|5.0|I just finished devouring this book. It's part science, part history, and part sociology, and somehow Mukherjee pulls it all together beautifully.  Mukherjee is a truly gifted writer who makes even relatively complicated concepts (e.g., kinases & pathways) absolutely fascinating. I have no background in science or medicine, but found myself riveted by the prose, rhythm (how the themes are interwoven), and the author's enthusiasm for his subject. Not a perfect book (is there such a thing?), but brilliantly researched and passionately written. It's a \\"must read\\" for anyone with half a brain and some curiosity.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|As stated, this game lags, crashes, and loses your data. I love this game but the coding for the game needs to be fixed to be worth spending money on, even at the reduced price. All in all it's probably a bad port, but it has yet to get fixed which shows that the developers just don't care to fix it.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|for those who love camp and blood, this is a great movie to watch. Break out the sharpening stones and your favorite blade and sit back with the bowl of popcorn as you watch some serious blood-letting.  For those who wondered what LiLo looks like in the nude, this is the movie. although it is a stretch to see her dressed as she is near the end of the movie.
0385534639|5.0|Guys. GUYS. I cannot tell you how much I loved this book. It deserves ALL THE AWARDS (should it get nominated for any), and Summit Entertainment better hurry the hell up and make the film. This is a gorgeous, lush story with prose that just kind of makes you drool and sigh over every page. This is the kind of book that both makes me feel inferior as a writer and want to be a better writer all at once. Yeah. It's that good.    I literally did sigh in wonder over every single page. There is not one bit of this book that isn't amazing, fabulous, or wonderful. None. Zero. Zip. And that's a lot coming from me, seeing as how picky I am.    And the best part? It leaves room for the reader to see how things will go from the ending onward, also leaving room for a sequel (though I'm not sure I'd want one, as the story felt more or less pretty complete by the last page). But it leaves room for the reader, period. It invites you in. It wants you to share in its unfolding. And that's so very rare in any genre right now, which made me appreciate it all the more.    The rhythm, the timing, the organization - all of this, too, was so well done it's really a wonder that this is a debut book at all. It feels like something that's been really labored over, really fine-tuned by someone that's not just starting out in the writing craft. Morgenstern is definitely a new voice to watch out for.    It has something for everyone - the romance isn't totally overbearing, there's mystery and wonder and it really made me feel as if I were a child at a classy circus like Cirque du Soleil seeing everything for the first time all over again. It's also pretty correct in the historical arena, as the last decade of the 1800s brought the whole \\"phantasmagoria\\" and spiritualist fad with it the most out of the latter half of that century. This was well-researched and carefully planned.    So you could say that I too am a reveur now, too. I just need to buy a red scarf and travel back in time to catch thecircus while I can. READ THIS BOOK. You won't be disappointed - if anything, you'll just be begging for more.    (posted to librarything, goodreads, shelfari, and [...])

0670022950|3.0|Pinker is as ever brilliant, and I found much intriguing and enlightening in this collection of  cherry-picked psychological research in support of a sociological thesis: stated simply (my words, not Pinker's): However unpleasant they may be from time to time, elites are necessary if society is to function properly.  For one example among many of Pinker's selectivity, he includes cutting edge evolutionary psychologist David Buss's work where it supports his own argument, but ignores his seminal inferences concerning reciprocal altruism, which differ in important ways from Pinker's.  Buss is far less convinced than Pinker that violence defines man more than the urge to connect.  Attachment theory doesn't even appear in the index.  When Pinker suggests that one reason for the correlation between modernism and relative peacefulness is because power increasingly controls who can and cannot be violent, which he considers not such a bad outcome, he enters the domain of the famous Frankfurt School sociologists and the postmodernists who followed.  However, he carefully  avoids dialogue with  renowned thinkers dating from Gramsci to Foucault  who  illuminated how power  renders people passive, depressed, uninformed and authoritarian through techniques of propaganda, misdirection, and cooptation.  Thus, non-physical, but profoundly destructive  methods of social control cast no shadow on Pinker's view of modern Western elites as in the main, progressive.  In sum, this seems less a comprehensive study than a scholarly polemic.  Having said this, much of the material is absolutely fascinating.

B005FFW46S|3.0|My pleasure at this new story from Terry Pratchett was unfortunately matched by my irritation with the huge numbers of typographical errors in the Kkindle version.  Particularly frequent was the removal of the space between any word followed by \\"people\\", leading to such words as \\"anypeople\\" and \\"wherepeople\\".  Frustrating, and a proof reader of the digital version should have spotted it instantly.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Where do I begin? There is nothing about the storyline, characters or production values that hasn't already been said 100 times over, but I just completed the 5 volumes (...and praying to the Seven for more) of A Song of Fire and Ice in hardbound. 3,964 pages not counting the appendices and additional notes. A pretty hefty literary investment for a writer I hadn't read before seeing the series on HBO.<br /><br />It was the superlative HBO series that made me want to read the entire series, and the books that made we want to buy the DVDs when they are out.

B005HXGE9G|5.0|This is everything that I wanted Sting's previous album to be.  These arrangements bring out new emotional elements to these<br />already fantastic songs.  I'm giving this a fiver rating even though it's really a four; this has to be done because people<br />are slamming this album who don't seem to want to allow Peter Gabriel to reinvigorate his own relationship to his songs.<br />Sting had the right idea, he just executed it poorly.

The violin is my favorite instrument, and wow what he can do with the violin is amazing. He takes you from the fast paced \\"Master of the Puppets\\" to the smooth sound of \\"Kashmir\\" and then takes you on a different direction with classics like the \\"5th\\" and \\"Taccata\\".  Even my \\"kids\\" 25,26,and 29, who are into country, rap, rock and pop respectively, love this cd.  My suggestion, buy it, buy it, buy it.
0345505387|2.0|Ok, so I knew this was going to be a graphic novel.  Not my favorite but I honestly didn't have a problem with that format--- starting out that is.  The biggest thing about this book to me was that it advertised that it would be telling Jamie's side of the story.  And for those of you who don't know who Jamie is I'd stop reading this review right now, there's no point in reading this book or review without having read the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon or you will be completely lost.<br /><br />The Exile is a graphic representation of Diana Gabaldon's first book, Outlander.  The basic premise of the story is that a mysterious woman, Claire, travels back in time in Scotland and gets caught up in events that force her to marry a young Scotsman named Jamie.  They are constantly managing to get in trouble but tend to fall in love with each other despite themselves as well.<br /><br />Since this is a graphic novel I'll focus on the art first.  While the pictures were very very pretty, they completely don't fit my original thoughts on what everything would look like.  Gabaldon tries to explain this with a footnote at the end explaining why some things had to be the way they are, but my thought is that if you can't make it like the book and true to it, why bother?  I was mostly disappointed in Claire, who really did look like a tart throughout the whole book and who's cleavage grew larger and larger with each page.  I was half surprised she didn't float away.  Jamie was ok, but still didn't really look like I pictured him to be.<br /><br />Because this book boasted that it was from Jamie's perspective, I was much surprised to see that it really wasn't.  It had scenes primarily with him of course, but the whole book was just a very scant retelling of Outlander with no new information that I could see.  And since it had been awhile since I've read Outlander, I even had some trouble lining up the storyline for a bit.  There were also side stories involving other characters and in this type of a book I thought they were out of place because there wasn't enough information shared to keep it from being confusing.<br /><br />I just wasn't impressed by this.  It had the opportunity to be something unique and it just didn't seem to pull it off real well.  The artwork was nice but that was about the only thing that was done well in this book.<br /><br />The Exile<br />Copyright 2010<br /><br />Review by M.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|I bought my blu-ray player just before Christmas 2010, and Star Wars was the first movie(s) I wanted to get. So I wasn't too happy that I had to wait nearly a year to get them. I don't live, eat and breathe Star Wars, so I didn't have a count down timer going, or going to be insanely picky like the light saber is going to be white in the middle. However, I am fairly disappointed.  I don't have a $3,000 entertainment system. While this information is relative, it may help some. When I am watching TV, I have the volume in the 5-9 range. For DVD/Blu-Rays, I generally bump it up to 12-15. For Episode I, I bumped it to 30, and still missed about 25% of what was said. Episode II had to bump up to 22-23, but missed some words if the actor was farther back on the scene. Episodes III & IV, was normal, 14-16.   Loading screens:  Episode I: No loading screen, it hangs for ~5+ minutes  Episode II & IV: has a loading screen (R2D2), loads in 2-3 minutes.  Episode III: No loading screen, but loaded in a minute or less.  I haven't watched V & VI yet, so I cannot report on those. Maybe I got a few bad discs, I cannot tell.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I was so glad to finally find out why Reacher was riffed from the Army.  It was mentioned in some of the other books but not in detail.  I really like Lee Child's writing.  You want to skip ahead to find out what happened, but you don't want to miss any of the path to get there.  Reacher is a truly moral man, but he does immoral things to achieve that goal.  I don't want to give anything away, but he does have a fleeting affair, obeys his superior's commands (even though they may be unspoken), and clears the Army while getting absolutely no credit for his actions.  Can't wait for another Lee Child novel.

But Stephanie nails it every single time.<br />3.Cricket Bell:I shouldn't even need to explain this one, but I will for those of you who haven't had the opportunity to be introduced to him yet. Tall, kinda nerdy, hot, and an absolute sweetheart. He isn't your typical love interest from YA. He gets embarrassed, he says awkward things, and sometimes he just doesn't make his move (for whatever reason).<br /><br />Lola isn't Anna. They're similar books, but their voices and personalities are drastically different. Just like Etienne and Cricket are two different boys, both desirable in their own ways. And I actually really liked that, because I'll confess that I was a bit worried that Lola would just be another Anna with a few changed details. But I'm so grateful that it wasn't, yet it didn't lose any of Anna's charm.<br /><br />So do yourself a favour, and pick up Lola today and just fall in love a little bit. ;)
B004X4R49Y|3.0|i like all the actors in this movie, which is why i wanted to watch it.  it's sweet and funny, very touching.  i enjoyed it, if you like the actors, and like period pieces, you'll enjoy this film.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This new album is a departure from Fallen or The Open Door. It's a much heavier, driving album that seems to focus on the band as a whole instead of just Amy Lee (hence the missing Amy Lee picture on this cover as compared to their last two albums). Every song is beautifully done and you can tell the WHOLE band was very much involved in the writing process. This album is 5 years overdue and should surprise hardcore, long time, Evanescence fans as well as get them some new ones! LOVE THIS!!!!
0316056863|5.0|Per my review at [...]  With the arrival of September comes the kick-off of the new television season, so I recently decided to take note of when all my favorite TV shows were making their triumphant return.  To my dismay, I discovered that there won't be any new doses of NBC's 30 Rock until January 2012 because Tina Fey is pregnant.  The nerve of her!    If you're just as disappointed as I am about 30 Rock's extended hiatus, there is one remedy I would recommend, and that comes in the form of Tina Fey's Bossypants, which was released this past April.  I was laughing before I even opened the book thanks to the hilarious back cover, which offered some \\"advanced praise for Bossypants.\\"  \\"Absolutely delicious.\\" - Guy who eats books.  \\"Totally worth it.\\" - Trees.).  This collection of short stories combines to form a memoir chronicling Fey's upbringing in suburban Philadelphia to her becoming the first female head writer on Saturday Night Live.  Readers also get some behind-the-scenes accounts of how the idea of 30 Rock came about and how the cast was chosen.    In many ways, Fey is like the female version of David Sedaris (whose book Me Talk Pretty One Day I recently reviewed).  She has a natural wit about her; her humor never seems forced or overdone, but just right.  As I was reading, I could picture Fey standing in front of an audience and saying everything she had written.  Readers can really get a feel for what Fey is like off screen, when she's not impersonating Sarah Palin or eating a cheeseburger as Liz Lemon.  Take this excerpt from \\"Delaware County Summer Showtime!\\"  Fey is leading into a story about her homophobic health teacher.    \\"I had to take eleventh-grade health in twelfth grade.  I had postponed it the year before so I could take choir and Encore Singers - it was kind of a big deal to be in both, whatever.  I was alto 1, but sometimes they had me sing second soprano.  I had a solo in \\"O Holy Night\\" in a performance at the mall.  In downtown Philadelphia.  Enough! Stop asking about it!\\"    For every time Fey takes a moment to brag, she takes five more to make fun of herself -another Sedaris-esque quality.  Fey becomes a champion for awkward, self-conscious women everywhere by unveiling various stories of awkward boy moments and fashion faux pas.  There's no shortage of comical home photographs scattered throughout the book (Ever wonder what Fey would look like sporting a bullcut and a polka-dotted dress while roller skating? Even if you haven't, it's worth checking out).    Bossypants is mostly full of laughs, but has its serious moments as well.  Sometimes I wished I could literally give Fey a high-five for her blunt honesty, like after reading \\"I Don't Care if You Like It.\\"  Fey focuses on women earning respect in the workplace, urging women to \\"Do your thing and don't care if they like it.\\"  Fey is as smart and opinionated as she is funny, which is evident in her success in the entertainment industry.    I've already read this book twice, and will probably read it twice more until 30 Rock's debut in January.  I'll close with this quote from Fey on reading:    \\"Read! When your baby is finally down for the night, pick up a juicy book like Eat, Pray, Love or Pride and Prejudice or my personal favorite, Understanding Sleep Disorders: Narcolepsy and Apnea; A Clinical Study. Taking some time to read each night really taught me how to feign narcolepsy when my husband asked me what my \\"plan\\" was for taking down the Christmas tree.\\"

0316776963|4.0|Per my review at [...]    David Sedaris has become one of our era's most beloved essayists since the publication of his first collection, Barrel Fever, in 1994.  His books are no strangers on the bestseller lists and many of his essays have become staples in writing classes.  In short, Sedaris' humor and wit have epitomized what modern short works require to appeal to the masses.  And yet, Sedaris would probably be the last to say he's a literary genius and the first to question the sanity of his cult following.  Sedaris's secret weapon is his penchant for self-deprecation, which creates a bond absent in the works of preachy, overconfident writers.    Me Talk Pretty One Day was Sedaris's first true break into the writing world back in 2000.  In this collection of short stories about his childhood and his years living in France, Sedaris addresses such topics as speech therapy, modern \\"art\\", pets, foreign languages, and technology.  The most impressive part of the collection is Sedaris's ability to put himself in his childhood mindset as well as tap into his thoughts as an adult without disrupting the flow of the narratives.  The essays all come together to create one book with a cohesive voice.  From \\"Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities\\" (in which a young David is forced to take guitar lessons from a midget when all he really wants to do is sing jingles) to \\"Picka Pocketoni\\" (in which an adult Sedaris muses over an American couple who assume he is French and thus hold nothing back as they talk about him in English), readers are guaranteed a healthy dose of laughs and \\"I know what you mean\\" moments.    Take the essay \\"Today's Special.\\"  Sedaris laments the loss of simplicity in America's favorite past time: eating.  Anyone who has ever looked at a menu and wondered whether it is in a foreign language or not will empathize with Sedaris and his wish that restaurants would Keep It Simple, Stupid.  \\"I'd order the skirt steak with a medley of suffocated peaches,\\" Sedaris writes, \\"but I'm put off by the aspirin sauce.  The sea scallops look good until I'm told they're served in a broth of malt liquor and mummified litchi nuts.\\"  He ends the piece by praising the hot dog - \\"so simple and timeless, I can recognize it, immediately, as food.\\"    \\"Twelve Moments in the Life of an Artist\\" is a perfect example of Sedaris's willingness to make fun of himself and also make a point.  Sedaris gives readers a timeline of his dabbles in the art world (and the drug world) while questioning what some people call \\"art\\" today.  \\"This was the art world I'd been dreaming of, where God-given talent was considered an unfair advantage and a cold-blooded stare merited more praise than the ability to render human flesh,\\" Sedaris muses.    Me Talk Pretty One Day is funny and thought-provoking from beginning to end.  If you're in search of a good laugh or an interesting perspective on the little things in life, Sedaris can offer you both and more.
0385732554|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry was an interesting book to read. It was really interesting how the former giver had to pass on information that the former one gained through the years it is like passing down fighting techniques down to your pupil. That what makes a book like this interesting to see what happens next. If a lot of books were like that they would be more interesting to read.
030788743X|4.0|I am a huge fan of the 80's, Cline and I were born in the same year and seem to share many similar interests.  I couldn't put Ready Player One down, but the authors references to 80's memorabilia and culture is bordering on indulgent.  Thus the 4 stars.  I could easily see this as a movie, however. Definitely recommended if you are remotely into 80's computing and music!

B000000P17|5.0|Spaghetti Incident is a completely different experience within GNR's material. Since nothing in this album was made to reach commercial success, this 13-track CD sounds pure, raw and harsh, and shows a different face of the band.   This CD is a selection of songs that both influenced the band (New York Dolls, UK Subs, Misfits, Nazareth, The Damned, T Rex, Dead Boys, Stooges) or just fun stuff (The Skyliners \\"Since I Dont Have You\\" or Charles Manson's \\"Look at Your Game, Girl\\").  Attention: Spaghetti Incident is NOT a tribute album, so don't expect hearing simple cover versions of punk-rock classics: GNR takes each song here to a whole new level, leaving the band's signature in every single detail.   Overall, although at the time the band members were barely speaking to each other, this album shows how GNR guys were talented and brilliant in making awesome versions of classic tunes. With state-of-the-art production, this album sounds even better than the Use Your Illusions (IMO). I would recommend this to any hard rock enthusiast.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Great way to start off a series.  Even though there are definitely some discrepancies between the books and this show, to me the show is better than the book, at least for now.  Tune in to Season Four on the CW Thursday Nights!!!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Outstanding and unbiased account of World War 2. Much attention to detail and accuracy of the material being presented. Interviews of those who were there and suffered the wrath of the war just emphasizes the experiences, the fears, the betrayal and the dedication of those who fought, died, or came back forever changed. Many risks were taken during the war, any one or more of which could have dramatically changed the final outcome of the war. Many bad decisions were made costing many lives unnecessarily. And decisions to end the war cost many lives, but not more than if the war had gone on. Luck played a large part as well. All of this is compiled into this wonderful series. It's no wonder that this series has been on the American screens since the release in 1974 after 3 years in the making. It's purely an outstanding series that can't be beat.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I was looking for a device to play mp3s in the car without having to build in a new audio system. I came across the concept of the FM transmitter and ended up choosing the Soundfly AUX because of the other reviews on this site. I was motivated to write a review for this gadget because there seems to be some confusion as to the play order of the tracks on the device. It doesn't sort the tracks at all - it plays them in the order in which you load the songs onto your SD card or USB stick. So the file you copy onto your stick first will be played first. It doesn't take any names or dates into consideration. So if you wish your files to be sorted alphabetically, make sure they are sorted alphabetically BEFORE you copy them and then copy them in one go and they should be copied alphabetically.  Another point is that if you have an SD card and a USB stick inserted at the same time, the device will remember the position you were at when you switch from one to the other.

B004ZNARH4|2.0|'Dark Side of the Moon' is an album dear to my heart - it was my introduction to Pink Floyd and is my 2nd favorite Floyd album after 'Animals'.  I looked forward to the 'Immersion' set and opted to go with this as compared to the more-favorably priced 'Experience' set.  While I am pleased with the content of all 6 discs, the so-called \\"collectibles\\" included are chaff.  It is causing me to reconsider whether or not to purchase the Immersion set for the upcoming 'Wish You Were Here' release.  Another warning to buyers - when I received my Immersion set, 3 of the 4 discs stored in the plastic base of the packaging had come loose during shipment and were extensively scratched from shifting around in the box.  Fortunately all play without issue - but there could have just as easily been damage to these discs, rendering them unplayable.    The audio/visual content itself is 5-stars - I give this a two-star rating only due to the Immersion set's superfluous packaging, pointless collectibles, and the damage during shipment.

Sure, it doesn't really have all that much extra content or anything but if dude's got some extra bones, or clams, or whatever you call them burning a hole in his pocket then he might as well get privy to all this new stuff called Blu Ray.

0385523912|5.0|This is an exceptional book.  I had read and was impressed with Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader but this is even better.  It gives the day in day out struggle just to survive in the DPRK. The author focuses on six people wo eventually defected with some additional anecdotes from a few others. This focus helps you see in some detail what day to day life was like before during and after the great famine of the 1990's.  I follow Asian politics in some detail and lived and worked in Asia for 13 years but I had no idea how bad things got as the entire system ground to a halt.  One telling fact the author brings out was the military, aside from a few elite units I'm sure, suffered almost as much as the rest of the population.  During the Cultural Revolution in China the PLA was protected from the worst excesses but in North Korea the average GI was as hungry as a factory worker.  Toward the end of the book you see that the citizens are becoming better informed about the outside world and no longer believe that they have it better than most. With Dear Leader preparing to turn the reins of government over to his son (who if pictures are to be believed seems \\"special\\")he might find he is in for a bumpy ride.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|Red Riding Hood starring Amanda Seyfried just left me bored and confused. It's hard to believe that this film is produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Catherine Hardwicke. I found no redeeming quality about this movie. Seyfried is a beautiful girl but this is definitely her worst peformance by far! She is so wooden as the title character and Gary Oldman just overdoes it. I can see why this film got a lot of bad reviews...it's a total stinker!
1439170916|5.0|THE HIDDEN CURE. Cancer is a chronic metobolic disease caused by a dietary deficiency of nitrilosides (B17) found in bitter fruit seeds and other unpopular foods just like scurvy is a deficiency of vitamin C or Pellagra  a deficency of vitamin B3. When these essentials are restored to the diet the disease is quickly reversed and the symptoms fade away. This information is catching on like wildfire as more and more people today are becoming aware  of and seeing through the corporate/ government agenda that is not in our best interests.In fact population control/ eugenics is part of their agenda along with coporate greed.  The highest consentrations of nitrilosides are found in raw apricot seeds and peach seeds or in the pill form of   amygdalin or laetrile B17.  Genesis 1:29   \\"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. \\"  Cultures and populations that consume an abundance of nitrilosidese are 100 % cancer free. however when individuals from these populations adopt the standard western diet they develope cancer at the same 3 in 1 rate as the rest of the world.   Chemo, radiation and surgery only mask the symptoms but do not address the underlying cause.  Cancer always returns and the end results is almost always a death sentence if the deficency issue is not addressed.  Smoking, radiation and other household  hazards are just triggers that determine where these symptons  tumors) will show up but are not the cause.   Cancer is not caused by anything but by the lack of something that has been deleted from the western diet.    This fact was discovered in 1952- Big druga / FDA  covered up the cure and declared it fraud and quackery. Watch the \\"WORLD WITHOUT CANCER\\" Video by G Edward Griffin and investigate the testimonies and case studies . Many lives have been saved just by modifying diet and just saying no thank you to the Big pharma / FDA /chemo/ radiation $ cartel population control agenda.

006029647X|5.0|Little House in the Big Woods is the first book in the excellent biographical Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series.  However, they do not need to be read in order and are great as stand alone stories.<br /><br />I search all over for Read Aloud Editions of books like this. The larger size, and larger color illustrations work so much better for bedtime reading than in a flimsy paperback.<br /><br />My 5 year old son loved this book as well as Little House on the Prairie Read-Aloud Edition. Although it has a girl main character, it works great for a boy, too. In fact, there is so much fascinating info. about life in the pioneer days that my 13 year old son also sat in on some reading sessions.<br /><br />I did not discover this series until I was an adult. I read them all in a week's time and loved them all. I can not wait to share them all with my children.<br /><br />The hard cover read aloud editions will last generations and I will be collecting them for my children's hope chests.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The scenes in the book are so vivid you have to take a deep breath and brace yourself for the things that will captivate your attention and suck you in. I thought I knew how George Martin writes a story that is where I am wrong. This book is different from the other two in terms of the plot however his passion for writing reflects in the book. I don't know about you but I recommend it to those who are willing to experience a different kind of fantasy where not all your expectations come true.

B00000J9HE|5.0|Like others in 'The Originals' series, this set has a liner note that tries a bit too hard to sell the product to us. However it contains one remark, intended to be about the conductor, that actually fits the music itself very well (make allowances for its being a translation) 'This sound-scenario, unclouded either by outpourings from the soul or expressionist rumblings, or by sentimental self-portrayal...' As applied to Karajan I'm not sure that even makes sense: as applied to nearly all the music here I'd say it makes excellent sense. My own idea of the last four Sibelius symphonies is like that - meaning absolutely no disparagement of Mahler or Shostakovich, these are pure 'absolute' music and their symphonies are not. I am not visited by images of Finland when I hear them (perhaps because I have never been there). Still less do they feature outpourings from the soul and whatnot as above. They stay within the bounds of pure 'absolute' music, if 'bounds' is the right word, which I doubt. Absolute music is an infinite universe in its own right, and I hear these four symphonies as the successors to the four symphonies of Brahms in revealing what it can achieve.<br /><br />If that's how I conceptualise them, then obviously that is also how I listen to these performances. In fact I have owned them on LP for a good many years, but I greatly welcome this economically-priced twin-cd set, which has the great Tapiola thrown in as well, and also The Swan of Tuonela in case anyone wants that. There has been some doctoring of the sound in the process, and you can hear it right at the start. The first note in the basses of symphony # 4 is marked fortissimo, sure, but it does not sound like this from Beecham or Berglund, nor indeed from Uncle Herbert himself on vinyl. I almost thought I must have put on the Brahms D minor concerto by mistake for a moment. Any remaining suggestions of this movement's origins as a string quartet (very marked from Beecham) are completely obliterated, and this fullness of tone pervades the set. The slow movement of # 4 is eloquently handled by Karajan, desolate and comfortless in its opening pages. However as the movement goes on there are sequences for full orchestra, and I shall need more hearings to convince myself that the ripe sound of these really suits the general expression. The start of # 5 is 'homogenised' and smoothed over as before, but the very end of the work starts to put strain on my sense of what kind of music this is. Great technicolour tone certainly, but giving me an uncomfortable sense of an MGM blockbuster.<br /><br />I think, really, I had better assess this set from two distinct viewpoints, one addressed to Karajan's faithful who will likely not brook much fault-finding, and the other for those who think and feel along anything like the lines I do. From a box-ticking point of view I guess most of the boxes get ticked. This is the great Berlin Phil, and we know how they can play. The sound is excellent of its type, and I may have managed to give some idea of that. Karajan is fully in touch with the idiom of this composer, and he was undoubtedly in many ways the leading conductor of his era. My own slight problem is with where he was leading us to. Even when I was young I thought him a bit of a media maestro, with his speedboats, fast cars, glamorous women and whatnot, especially whatnot I dare say. To this day I can never get out of my mind Beecham's immortal 2-edged gibe 'a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent', and although I find any amount to admire and enjoy in these accounts, my recollection reverts enviously to the performances I have from Beecham himself, and not only Beecham either but also Kajanus between the wars in classic accounts that still manage to sound surprisingly well. Karajan set very high standards, but it was a little too standardised for my own liking.<br /><br />Symphonies 6 and 7 come off very well (so do 4 and 5, come to that, in case I seem to have hinted otherwise.) In #6 the characteristic `pale' tone is caught exactly, and the speeds are reasonable, much like Berglund's. I mention that point because my collection also includes a classic Finnish account from Schneevoigt in the 1930's that manages to lop 5 minutes off Karajan's timing. That, in a work lasting distinctly less than half an hour, is quite a bit of lopping. With # 7 Karajan excels himself in my own favourite sequence, the marvellous stretch of total euphony that begins after about 2 and ½ minutes and lasts for about 3 more, finally ushering in the solemn trombone theme with an effect like revealing some Holy Grail. This was around 1920, yet here for a few precious moments is the very tone of Beethoven's Lydian Song bestowed on us again.<br /><br />In The Swan of Tuonela I suppose I can recommend this performance to anyone able to endure the piece. Tapiola is another matter, and to my Category A Karajan devotees I can give the account something like full marks. To my Category B fellow-curmudgeons I have to whisper that it is not in the league of Beecham or Kajanus. And speaking of Kajanus, try to hear how he handles the first movement of # 5, with its sense of low rainclouds scudding across the sky and the wonderful morphing of the first section into the second, the sequence that gave Sibelius more trouble than anything else in his published output.<br /><br />5 quite honest stars from one point of view, because my own slant on all this is not one that I demand agreement with.
