6304696515|5.0|I saw many times this film since that one appeared. What can i say? Is one of the best films of our time and  with a  beautiful &#34;mise en scène&#34;. The best work from Glenn Close...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Being in the medical field this book was great, how Dr. Alexander explained the process of the brain in different states.  Thank you for sharing your experience with us.  Other patients have said the same thing after experiencing a NDE.

B008XG1X18|4.0|More than expected. Good download. Would recommend to people without hesitation. Keep it simple and free and you will have a winner.
B0097VS7ZS|5.0|What a great way to pass time with the little ones when you find yourself with bored children.  We each take turns coloring a picture then award pieces of candy for the best colored picture.  This keeps the children entertained and brings some fun into the boredom of waiting.  A must have with small children.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game. Could use more in the directions side.  My year old caught on fairly quickly. Game works well on the Samsung.

B006YG9HJE|4.0|I love the Nikita TV show so having the second season all to myself meant I can watch some of my fave episodes again and again. Plus no commercials which is a huge bonus .  I find I lose track of the story sometimes when it's on TV and there are commercial breaks.

B004GVUPFE|4.0|I haven't gotten very far through it.  It advances quickly and I guess I' not have the spacial awareness to figure it out.  But then I was never good at rubix cube or those little puzzle games where you have to line up all the numbers.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|good action, credible storyline.  being a &#34;tres&#34; myself, i avoided the temptation (after two daughters) of naming a son, the FOURTH!  oy, i thought better of it.  needless to say, we were not blessed with a son.  nevertheless, if he had been &#34;bourne,&#34; he would have been named John Carlos!  time to move on...

B005NJU8PA|5.0|Haven't read this book but I love it so far some recipes are good. Some of the book reviews were told that I should be a patient because it may not work out in the begging.
B004X4QW42|5.0|A quality film which will propel the excitement for Kung Fu and the health, strength and mind qualities it provides.<br />  Donnie and Sammo played their roles well. The choreography was excellent and the martial arts believable. Yes that includes the final table challenge scene. While I can't begin to calculate the probability of one person landing a table, let alone two; I can say I have experienced some magical (ie. Quantum physics assited explanation required) kung fu happenings. And I don't have the training of a master. So who knows what Yip Man experienced. In the end the overall kung fu is very enjoyable. Lotsa ropes, wires and computer animation not necessary.<br />  Now this story holds a common theme when white people are involved in Chinese Kung Fu films. The so-called 'sick men of asia'. It was the propaganda that the colonialists sold to scare the Chinese people into submission and get recruits also. And the ditaste for colonial white ways was, while over the top, way palpable. Its clear in this film that the national psychae is still healing from the dehumanizing treatment of 100 years.<br />  However, don't let the racism stop you from enjoying a great flick. I don't. As a tall black man with beard and joylocks, upon seeing me most asians go into defense mode and start clutching purses, squaring shoulders and protecting women until the danger of me has passed. This has been going on for decades. I still enjoy martial arts and asian culture. Thankfully not every one buys into the propaganda.<br />  Finally if your like me and can't afford or find a good teacher and so you train yourself, this movie provides good techniques. Enjoy. JAH Love
B00A80SHFM|2.0|To say that I am a Les Miserables fan, would be an understatement to the max.  Not only have I seen this show live so many times that I have lost count, but I have also, through the years, purchased every version of this show in every language available, save the Israel cast.  So, waiting for this album to come out was suppose to be a welcome change, however it failed miserably (pun intended).<br /><br />I was waiting with bated breath to hear my favorite songs in a fresh new light, to hear iconic actors sing said songs on the big screen, and to be able to hear a version I have never heard before, but as the title of this review states, I am very disappointed to say the least. However, in full disclosure, the reason for my disappointment could be the fact that I own, and have listened to, so many different versions of Les Miserables, that I was expecting a melodic and beautiful rendition of this classic musical, similar to the movie version of Evita with Madonna and Antonio Banderas.  What was delivered, on the other hand, was a raspy, forced, not well sung, seemingly spliced together version of Les Miserables, where even the lyrics have been changed in many key songs. So, in short, I would hold of on purchasing this album altogether.<br /><br />I still plan on seeing the movie on Christmas day and hopefully the songs will come across better on the big screen, but as soundtracks go, you are better off with the best versions of Les Miserbales ever made, that of the 10th Anniversary \\"dream Cast\\" concert with Colm Wilkinson, Lea Salonga. Philip Quast, and Michael Ball, et all. and the Complete Symphonic Recording.<br /><br />V/R<br /><br />Sean

B00006CXSS|5.0|Bought this a while back, love the series back when it was on HBO, and bought it for a great buy, it came within a week, which was sooner then the company said it would arrive! and i was proud to see that none of the packaging was broken and that none of the disks were scratched, great buy and if im going to buy another series im going to look here first!

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie is unappropriate and predictable.  I cannot believe Mark Wahlberg has associated himself with this film.  Do not let you children watch this for sure.  We turned it off after 20 minutes hoping it would get better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved this book hated the ending !!!! I think there will be a second one and hopefuly we will all get the ending we are hoping for !!!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Loved it, My DVD Library definitely needed this added to it. Now, To find the time to watch them all again!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I am a Kelly Clarkson fan from the American Idol days. I commute to my job in the morning when there is a lot of traffic and the radio dj's talk too much. I enjoy singing on the way to work and this is the perfect cd to do that to. Since is Kelly Clarkson's greatest hits they are all familiar songs that I remember plus I really like the new ones too. Turn it on and get lost in the songs

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! This book was just amazing, I had so many emotions rush through me while reading. The last book to do that to me was Beautiful Disaster.  I felt like i was sharing Sky and Holder's emotions as the felt them and it was so real. Excellent book!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My favorite series from any production company in any era. I highly recommend Downton Abbey. It begins with a terrific series of scripts from outstanding writer(s), brilliant acting and sumptuous sets. Top it off with a score that fits perfectly and you have a must-see production from PBS.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I have watched this film over 30 times. I guess what I thought to be the background music was not what is on the soundtrack.  Two cuts I recognize. But I am still happy with this product!
B009IJJB8G|1.0|The actor portraying Holmes is about the most annoying person I have had the unfortunate experience of having to listen to...<br />if that makes sense.<br /><br />I would rather rather lose toenails, one-at-a-time to Moriarty than listen/watch Holmes.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It is a funny film and I thoroughly enjoyed. The voice given to the bear is really good and not single boring moment. Not for kids.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is why I watch television at all. It has style, dramatic tension, superb acting and terrific writing.<br />I HIGHLY recommend Downton Abbey.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was amazing!!!! I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this book! I hope there is another one!
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Better than the first one but still not great.  I think I will just get my Castle fix from watching the show.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I liked the movie but Jeremy Renner just does not seem to be at the same level as Matt Damon.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|This movie definitely feels like a live version of Seth McFarland's Family Guy series.  Very similar humor and jokes plus he tends to lean more towards the 80's in his references.  So if you're a Family Guy fan then give this movie a view.  A good funny time to be had.
0345529057|3.0|Great story cycles usually come in threes (\\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"Griffin and Sabine,\\" \\"The Hunger Games\\"). I wish George R. R. Martin, the author of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, had confined himself to a trilogy, too. Okay, maybe five books, at the most.<br /><br />Instead, I'm afraid this series which started out so well is going to turn into one of those interminable, overly-ambitious epics that collapse into a big, sprawling mess before finally limping to a conclusion. (Remember the \\"Earth's Children\\" series by Jean Auel?) At this rate, the successful HBO TV series based on these books is going to overtake the author and his fans will start to lose interest.<br /><br />I tore through the first three books of this series (\\"A Game of Thrones,\\" \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords\\"). Usually I'm not much of a fantasy-genre fan, but even I liked these first three books. The stories, which take place in an unspecified time period which seems medieval, chronicle the exploits of the Stark, Lannister, and Baratheon families and the other houses that follow them during their battles over who will rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. In a separate storyline set on another continent, there's also an exiled princess who hopes to come back and reclaim Westeros. There's just enough dragons, magic and sorcery to qualify the stories as fantasy, yet they are also realistic enough to be totally believable. There's also lots of violence, brutality and sex in them, so be forewarned if you're squeamish about those things.<br /><br />The best thing about these books is the rich and complex characterization. The dwarf Tyrion Lannister, the knight Jaime Lannister, and the Lady Catelyn Stark are some of the most complicated, morally ambiguous, yet likeable fictional characters that I've encountered in a long time.  I also liked the positive, diverse portrayal of women in this series. There are several strong female characters who use their wit and cunning to get what they want in spite of the restrictions of their societies.<br /><br />However, the series starts to bog down in the fourth book, \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" and gets worse in the fifth,\\"A Dance with Dragons.\\" Just as we get caught up in the fates of familiar characters we've come to know and love (or hate), Martin introduces a whole slew of other characters in whom we're also supposed to make an emotional investment. (We do in some, but not most.) There's also way too much exposition that doesn't do much to move the plot forward.<br /><br />Martin is certainly an imaginative and talented writer. I just hope he doesn't sacrifice cohesiveness on the altar of creativity. It also takes great discipline to know when enough is enough and wrap things up into a satisfying conclusion. The only modern writer who has been able to successfully create a series of this scale in a timely manner without losing its fan base is JK Rowling with the \\"Harry Potter\\" books. And even she almost ran out of steam by the last book.<br /><br />There's supposedly two (maybe even three) more books to go in the Ice and Fire series. I sincerely hope Mr. Martin proves me wrong and finishes up this series in the way it deserves.<br /><br />Note: If you're using an e-reader, it's probably better to purchase each book in this series separately instead of the entire set. You pay about the same amount separately as you would for the whole set, and I've also heard that there can be formatting problems if you download the entire set onto an e-reader.ant in spite of the restrictions of their societies.<br /><br />However, the series starts to bog down in the fourth book, \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" and gets worse in the fifth,\\"A Dance with Dragons.\\" Just as we get caught up in the fates of familiar characters we've come to know and love (or hate), Martin introduces a whole slew of other characters in whom we're also supposed to make an emotional investment.

6305263248|1.0|This order was bull$#!%&. When I got the disc, neither mine nor any of my friends' DVD players would even recognize it as a DVD. It wouldn't even get to the main menu. Nothing. Worthless. Only reason I haven't asked for my money back is because I didn't keep the receipt. But NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER. EVER.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Beautiful actors, greats sets, weak story line.  This is an example where you leave the book alone until another script writer and director can get their hands on it.  It's a shame that with all the talent the American film industry has, that this is the best they can do with this novel.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Most of  my faves are on here so I am rally enjoying it. I am a fan starting with. American Idol and Nashe has only gotten better.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great classic and great morale message that remains congent today (and will be the same tomorrow.)  Hugo does not mind being wordy in places, but some of his discriptions are masterful and he puts the reader at the scene.  Well worth the time.

B00797MB0O|3.0|I had mixed feelings about this movie, gave it three stars for the acting, not the story line. I hated the ending, felt like nothing was resolved. Mavis was the same person she was at the beginning and the end. I kept getting mad at her because she just would not comprehend what makes someone happy and fulfilled. I had some hope for Mavis to change at the end after the naming party, but Matt's sister ruined it. I was irritated that Mavis couldn't see that Matt's sister was just saying all those things about the townspeople to suck up to her. In the end all Mavis gained was more confidence boost and probably a new car.

B005G5PPGS|5.0|I was raised and live in Texas where I was a Terrible little league baseball player who watched my friends play high school baseball during off season football. Now as a Dad of several sons, none of whom were devoted baseball players, I enjoy that the Rangers are good, admire Nolan Ryan and Ron Washington and have been to some games. But this book lit my fire. It glorifies baseball and makes it much more relevant to life outside of the game of baseball ,or outside of any game. It glorifies rightfully those who have the urge and nerve to imagine and create despite the resistance of inertia and obstacles. And, coming across it so long after publication enables a look at reaction and rancor of those so bent on a system that they refuse to consider another. This is a wonderful book by an excellent writer!

B005LAII08|5.0|Imagine Disney/Pixar doing a movie where grown (animated) men are running around butt-naked (no frontal nudity, however), and where there is the scariest bear ever seen in an animated motion picture. Imagine a Disney move (animated or not) where there is no beautiful and vulnerable princess, no prince charming to save her, and no villain to be killed off or banished in the end.<br /><br />Imagine a movie of any sort where the two strongest characters, whose conflict anchors the plot, are both strong and good women (well, one of them is a teen-ager). And imagine that in this unimaginable movie there are no male villains, just well-intentioned guys who can't see past the status quo when it comes to recognizing that women have brains as well as bodies.<br /><br />Well, at least there is magic and will-o-the-wisps and a witch (but not a wicked one), and a valuable moral at the core.<br /><br />My pre-adolescent granddaughters, if you combined them into one, would be the heroine of &#34;Brave&#34; - red hair and all. It was so gratifying to take them to this movie (the 3D adds a lot) not knowing just how fabulous the role modelling would be.<br /><br />Caution, however! The bear is very scary.

B005EHQGTS|5.0|As a trial lawyer I'm often away from my office, in court or in deposition or in a meeting, where I realize I need information I didn't think to bring with me. With Splashtop HD and a cell phone or my Kindle Fire, I can quickly access files, graphics and other data without downloading to my remote device.<br /><br />The response is amazingly fast over a good WiFi or 4G connection, there are no problems with screen sizing on the remote, and the resolution on my Kindle Fire 8.9 HD is superb. Although I've never had reason to suspect that the security of my settings has been compromised, I do change my password regularly and do not have my remote devices automatically remember it.<br /><br />Definitely a must-have for the road warrior.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I couldn't stand the original, so I was very hesitant about watching this. I was really surprised how well I liked it. The cast was well chosen. The on-screen chemistry was very believable. There was enough action to be interesting, but not overwhelming.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|From time to time (earlier versions), reviewers rated Kingsoft Office the best of breed. I tried it and imagine my relief when I found that I could eagerly remove it from my tablet having lost nothing but some peace of mind. It's a frustrating program for an Office user. If you need the basic functionality of Office (Word, Excel and Powerpoint) shell out the few bucks and buy Quick Office Pro HD.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The acting is top notch and the storyline is novel and gripping.  Both my husband and I were hooked from the first episode.
0307352145|5.0|Well written book that is full of interviews, scientific studies, anecdotes, and advice. This is a great book for everyone, not just introverts. Even though you've probably already heard several of the studies she cites in this book, she has plenty of things you might not have heard before and interprets and integrates them to create an in-depth understanding of introverts- why they act and think they way they do, how our society came to overvalue extroverts, and how extroverts and introverts can best work together. As Susan Cain says, it's all about balance; she's not putting introverts on a pedestal but creating a balance between the introverts and extroverts.
B000HKYBXA|4.0|Terrific production of the shakespearean play. Very accurate and beautiful production. Only flaw is branagh casting his forty something self as hamlet. The scenery is breathtaking and the cast is wonderful
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Wonderful staunt work, excellent action pact movie. This is a type of movie that must be seen several times to truly appreciate the staunt work
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever and I love the people who made the game I play it every day
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have read many classics but this was breathtaking! I must admit to skipping pages and pages if historical facts that I found to be more than I could bare. The expedition of Jean from criminal to saint was masterfully created. I couldn't wait to skip overloaded pages of information to get to the crux of the story; a man transforming his life. Add to that....love! Love of a child! A child who gave love so readily to him, even though she had never truly experienced it herself. Being a woman of faith, I believe God blesses us even when we don't believe we deserve it. Bravo! I loved it. The movie is coming out Christmas day. I hope it does this classic justice. 12/23/12
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Great movie, can't wait the next chapter, only the blu ray box could be better, like box the previous movie.
B000W15B24|5.0|Though you can obviously hear the age in his voice, Johnny Cash puts more feeling to each song as if it was a part of his past, even on &#34;Personal Jesus.&#34;  Much like Willie Nelson singing &#34;Always on My Mind&#34; today in his much later age, you get the feeling that the artist has left loose strings in his past - a story told of his younger days
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I loved the original Total Recall with &#34;Ahhnuld&#34; Schwarzenager.  This one had some big shoes to fill.  I can't say it was better than the original but it was still good enough to keep myself and my two sons up until 12:15AM.  The women ended up going to bed.  The women were hot and the action was nonstop.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|wonderful story that brings to light the human side of the royal family and the therapeutic effects of compassion, belief and care from one human being towards another.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Great for those looking for Bond themes by the original artists.  If you're a fan of the diverse range of artists and styles, then this is for you.  I only regret that Adele's &#34;Skyfall&#34; was not included.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was entertaining but a bit formulaic. I would qualify this as a watch it while youre doing something else movie. Its got good movement and the idea is fun but  you can practically write the plot yourself.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Worthwhile seeing.  Clint Eastwood as a disgruntled baseball scout and distant father or so it seemed.  Mix in a little comedy, romance and the love of a father for the well being of his daughter and it all adds up to a great movie.  Loved it!
B007UXTG8M|5.0|I felt hollowed out after watching this. I loved how the writer really portrayed  this persons patterns and life with no depth. and how his only real connection was and invasion in the illusion he had crafted for himself. Sad and great
0316226424|5.0|I found this one to be the best out of all of them, To bad the movie doesn't follow the books better
B008CP93S0|4.0|Sooooo predictable. Its a typical comedy with characters likeable enough.  Its mindless and pleasant not bad just ok, kinda like all of Jennifer Anniston films.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Even though it wasn't free it was only one dollar. It also took a long time to load... I might be exaggerating just a little. Anyways the graphics were great.This is a cool action game that anyone would love. But, the movie is a tad bit better than the game!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|For some reason this movie felt really comfy. Maybe the warmth of its Indian setting seeped through.  I enjoyed the characters and the circumstances they found themselves in. It wasnt predictable, but you did get to see the characters lives unfold in a way that left you feeling rosey.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Original review @ [...]<br />No, no I will not start this off with a memorable quote or particularly witty comment from the book because besides the fact that there is nothing remotely memorable or witty in this book I will not give it the satisfaction. I am sorry and must make a disclaimer here. As a rule, I am not mean about books, I do not enjoy being rude about another person's work but this book I could not let slide. Preview: I found it offensive, degrading and overall a complete slap in the face to women everywhere which is why I will be so heated in my thoughts on this. I read this book roughly a week and a half ago and I am still enraged that I wasted my time. In fact, the more I think about it the angrier I get because I know people who love this book and that fact alone gives me the urge to go into a blind rage.<br /><br />Anyways, I will write this and let out all my aggression and then be done thinking about this. WARNING: SPOILERS HERE...YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.<br /><br />This book has so many things wrong with it I do not know where to begin so to summarize; Abby is a freshman at college, Travis is a sophomore and the resident guy who sleeps with everyone on campus. He fights in an underground fighting club where he beats the living daylights out of random other students for money. Classy guy already, right? So Abby is best friends with America who is dating Travis's cousin/roommate Shep, thus they meet and for some unknown reason after banging 90% of the student body he becomes enthralled with Abby who is immune to his, erm, charms? She tries to fend him off in a complete mature and rational way...when she sees him she purposely wears pajamas, no makeup and glasses...um, ok? Last I checked we are supposed to fall in love with people for what they have on the inside so your outward appearance would have no effect on his feelings for you. But don't forget people, we are dealing with the creme de la creme of maturity in these character here...keep reading.<br /><br />This doesn't work, clearly, and eventually Abby loses a bet to Travis that forces her to live in his apartment for 30 days. Huh? Anyway. Travis overhears Abby saying how she could never date Travis because he is too much of what she was trying to get away from in her former life (her dad is an addicted gambler, we'll get there though). So, Travis is upset and he makes the mature decision to go out, get hammered, brings home not 1 but 2 girls to have a threesome with on the couch (because Travis \\"does not bag chicks in his bed\\"...how charming), all while Abby is in his room and she hears this going on for over an hour. For some reason that will never be rationally explained or defended she still stays, oh wait, it's because he shows up the next morning with all her favorite food...read: abusive relationship in the making, presents after a fight. America is the worst friend in the world because she sits there and tells Abby how Travis is different with you, he really likes you, blah blah blah. So Travis's irrational and immature behavior gets a bye because he has never had the emotional capacity before this to actually care about somebody. Cry me a frickin' river. I cannot stand men like this. Their feelings are hurt and we are supposed to give them a pass because they are able to correctly identify a feeling? Gimme a break. With how many women Travis has slept with and probably broken every single one of their hearts along the way, forgive me for not feeling sorry for him because we all know he has it coming. Welcome to heartbreak, welcome to the life of every woman out there, welcome to the fact that you do not always get the person you like to like you back.<br /><br />The rest of the story is monotonous; it goes like this. Abby resists Travis, he doesn't get the picture, Travis continues to pursue Abby, Abby finally gives in, they date, they break up, they date again, they break up, um, she dates another guy in there somewhere who is absolutely perfect(no sarcasm I swear), Travis beats the crap out of a guy that is innocently teasing Abby (and when I say beat up I mean left the kid bleeding and unconscious), they go to Vegas to bail out Abby's dad, there is a fire at a fight (totally realistic), and the CHERRY on the FRICKIN' sundae is that to end all of their drama and to conclude this story they do the only mature and rational thing that there is to do...THEY GET MARRIED IN VEGAS.<br /><br />ARE YOU KIDDING ME HERE?! HOW IS THIS OKAY?!<br /><br />Ok...deep breaths. There are so many things wrong with this I don't know where to start. First, when Abby leaves Travis the first time he trashes his apartment. Breaks stereos, rips and throws away the sheets on his bed, swings at his cousin, the works. Complete temper tantrum. Not only that, any guy that says anything to Abby, good or bad, he either verbally lashes out at or physically maims. When did this become okay? Does McGuire have no sympathy for human suffering or pain? What the deuce? Not only that, the red flags are so close to Abby's face she might as well be wearing them as a headband. Hunnie, it's only a matter of time until he hits you, this is the token beginning of any abusive relationship and it SHOULD NOT be romanticized in this book. McGuire writes about Travis's stalking and obsessive and codependent behavior as if this type of relationship should be sought after...uh, no!<br /><br />I feel like this entire novel and situation is the bad daydream of a naive 15 year old. I'm not sure I can verbalize this into understanding but its almost like when you were young and you have a crush on a boy. You fantasize about him falling for you immediately, but in that same daydream you think that fighting and drama are fun and something every relationship should have and in the end you'll still live happily ever after. I'm not sure if that makes sense how I said it but that's the vibe I got from this. Some diluted daydream of a relationship that's all fun and drama and break ups and make ups. This is beyond dysfunctional.<br />In addition to that this entire book is completely offensive to women. That Abby would let a guy treat her like this, beat people up who talked to her, call her his property, all while when he gets mad, he gets crazy drunk and brings home random chicks. Have a little self esteem girlfriend! C'mon! And no other girl is introduced in this book besides Abby and America who are even remotely intelligent or worthy of anybody. Every other girl is a \\"skank\\" or \\"slutty\\" or \\"dumb.\\" Why is this okay to be breaking down of another woman's psyche. Aren't we supposed to support one another and back up our fellow females...ESPECIALLY against an abusive male specimen. Where is the love?<br /><br />I cannot even begin to dissect or talk about the ending of this book because that fact that they thought it would be a good idea and the solution to their problems to get married is so far beyond all intelligent human thought that I believe something has to be wrong with with the human race is there are people who believe this is how the story should end. No, this is actually how women end up with abusive husbands, why our divorce rate in America is so high, and why young girls think that they need to settle for whatever guy<br /><br />looks their way twice.<br />Alright, I think I'm done. I'm sure there are about a dozen more points I can make about why this book is not okay but for now my aggression is sated. I feel better. Please never read this book. Thank you.(no sarcasm I swear), Travis beats the crap out of a guy that is innocently teasing Abby (and when I say beat up I mean left the kid bleeding and unconscious), they go to Vegas to bail out Abby's dad, there is a fire at a fight (totally realistic), and the CHERRY on the FRICKIN' sundae is that to end all of their drama and to conclude this story they do the only mature and rational thing that there is to do...THEY GET MARRIED IN VEGAS.<br /><br />ARE YOU KIDDING ME HERE?!

B009RI4FRU|5.0|Its a quirky ride. Everything in this movie had me enchanted.I knew this would be a home run and it didnt let me down.
0385536828|5.0|Original review posted at Belle of the Literati @[...]<br />\\"I was irritated by the way he conflated his own shifting needs<br />with an impersonal destiny.<br />I want it, therefore...it's in the stars!<br />What was it with men, that they found elementary logic so difficult?\\"<br />--Ian McEwan, Sweet Tooth<br /><br />Ok, so I have to admit, I was a little in reserve about starting this. I have had such a run of young adult literature that when I delve back into the adult fiction world I get a little nervous. Will I get into it? Will it be paced fast enough to keep me interested? It turns out my hesitation was completed unfounded. Books like Sweet Tooth make me yearn for more books like it. I have previously only read Atonement by Ian McEwan and fell in love with it. Upon finding out that his new book had his first female narrator since Atonement I was immediately intrigued...then I found out that it takes place during the Cold War and is centered around a woman working for MI5 with a secret mission...um, okay! And there's a quick summary of the book. Serena's mission, she does choose to accept it, is to persuade a young author to accept a salary through a fake organization that is secretly backed the British government in order to urge people away from communism through the form of literatue. Example: like 1984 and Animal Farm. The author is obviously unaware where the funding comes from. Serena and said author eventually initiate an affair, which complicates things ever further for her...more than that, you'll have to read to find out.<br /><br />The book started out catching my interest. The narration is excellent, you can hear the voice of Serena immediately. The setting of the 1960s into 1970s is wonderful. I could picture the smart suits of women and hear the clicking of the high heels down the corridors of the office. And the cover is partially the reason for that. I love it! The whole cinematographic feel of the dulled colors and sepia undertones just looks so vintage 1970s. I really just love to stare at it...anyways...<br /><br />The story takes us from a brief introduction to Serena's childhood into her affair with an older professor who eventually helps secure her a position with MI5, from there she gets her mission. The story has a leisurely pace to it but I never found myself bored. I loved being thrown into London 1972 with Serena even through her most mundane tasks. She is a lover of books and devours novels like it's nothing, so immediately I was drawn to her character. She wears her heart on her sleeve, is quick to please her authorities, and yearns for approval. She is trying to find her niche in life and the story has only a hint of coming of age which I really liked. Her descriptions of the men in her life were honest but, to a point, hilarious sometimes. Intimate details about her lovers had me laughing out loud, I do not know if this was the intention of the author but it provided hints of comic relief that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />The writing of the story, for the most part, is brilliant. Beautiful prose and I really got a feel for the setting and the emotions involved with each location in regards to Serena's feelings about them. There are several passages that discuss at length political policy at the time and to be honest I was lost. I tried to pay attention and figure out what they were talking about but politics is not my forte so upon realizing that is had only minimal to do with the overall plot I kind of skimmed those areas.<br /><br />While McEwan's writing is brilliant there were a few points during the writing of Serena's inner monologue that didn't seem to match up with the rest of her character. She made a few observations about other people that seemed immature and out of character for her which made me think that McEwan didn't have the female psyche down completely.<br /><br />Similar to Atonement, all is not as it seems throughout the novel. That is really all I can say, I do not wish to ruin any plot points but let's just say the ending blew me away and left me utterly speechless...actually no, I was speechless after uttering 'That was bloody brilliant' immediately after finishing. This book will not disappoint readers, I loved it, and if any of you have read I would love to hear your thoughts!away and left me utterly speechless...actually no, I was speechless after uttering 'That was bloody brilliant' immediately after finishing.

1439152802|5.0|Original Review posted at Belle of the Literati @ [...]<br /><br />\\"There were moments, Laurel solemnly believed,<br />in which a person reached a crossroads,<br />when something happened,<br />out of the blue,<br />to change the course of life's events.\\"<br />--Kate Morton, The Secret Keeper<br /><br />I have been a Kate Morton fan for years. She has written 4 published novels in total and each one is just as spectacular, if not more so, than the last. The Secret Keeper is no exception. I had the honor of meeting Ms. Morton a few weeks ago and she is absolutely lovely! So kind, her accent is divine and I heard her voice in my head the entire time I was reading. Each and every one of her books is a stand alone novel and absolutely brilliant storytelling. But I'm getting ahead of myself...<br /><br />The Secret Keeper begins in the 1960, spends most of its time between 2011 and 1941, with a few pit stops in 1958 and other various years. It. Is. Wonderful. The back drop of the beginning is Laurel, one of our main characters, witnessing a crime involving her mother, something she never really understood or got over. Now, in 2011 her mother is near the end of her days and Laurel begins to reminisce about the events of her youth. Morton then back flashes to London during The Blitz in the midst of World War II. The story revolves around Dolly (Laurel's mother), her boyfriend Jimmy, and friend Vivien. Honestly, I really cannot say more than that because it will give away the plot. Just go read it. Wait, no, before you read this one, go read her other books first. K, thanks.<br /><br />Kate Morton is a storyteller. She is brilliant. She weaves a tale that keeps you guessing and scratching your head and putting your forehead in your hand because juuuust when you think you've figured something out she throws you for another loop. You honestly never get the whole story until the absolute end. It is brilliant. I'll say it again. I have to. Absolute genius. I have no idea how she begins to ravel this story up. It is so intricate and detailed that is really is nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />The characters in this book are wonderful. Their voices are so clear and unique that I felt like I was living inside this book and seeing 1941 London right before my eyes. Not to sound cliche but the characters make you laugh, cry, ache and yearn for something more for them. I loved all of them. And Jimmy? Oh, Jimmy. What an amazing character. He is honest and loyal and just good. He is a good person and beautiful inside and out. He was by and far my absolute favorite. Gerry is a close second :)<br /><br />There is just something so raw about a story taking place in wartime. It is a juxtaposition of adjectives. It is raw and honest yet secretive and mysterious. Harsh but, to me, there is a sense of innocence that goes along with it as well. Nobody knew what the next day would hold or if there even would be a next day. In a time where chastity and virtue where cherished, women were having secret affairs with their lovers going off to war because it might be the only time they ever have together. The pure emotion of love for loved ones in this time against a backdrop of such hate is beautiful in an odd way.<br /><br />The writing is perfection. It is so poignant and heartfelt and my heart was just aching during some parts. I could not flip the pages fast enough in order to unravel this mystery. Morton herself talked about loving stories that make her fall down the rabbit hole and this is one of those stories. I just felt to blissfully lost in this world the whole time I was reading it. I love this author, I love her stories and I cannot wait for her next rabbit hole to appear in the land of literary.and detailed that is really is nothing short of spectacular.

B009V3KKXY|5.0|JD's book is fantastic. It's well organized and the step by step instructions, including the pictures, are very simple to follow.  As a par cord enthusiast, I would recommend his book to anyone looking to start tying knots for bracelets, lanyards, and whatever else one may be able to think up.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This app is not that bad. It hangs on me every now and then but overall it's a decent app.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I've watched this movie four times already and just love all the characters. I never realized there were people who went to such extremes to see birds. This movie is one reason I've become a birder. I love the outdoors and I have had indoor birds, and now I'm a backyard birder. These characters are funny and realistic at the same time. Enjoy the movie.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|always fun - and kirk and spock are both captured brilliantly.  Nice way to start an alternate timeline and open up for a whole new storyline
B001DHXT20|5.0|I loved this movie and would happily recommend this product .  I'm happy to have it in my collection of Avenger heroes.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not the best Tim Burton movie or Johnny Depl either. Some parts were amusing but overall just OK. I felt it really fell apart at the end. I used to watch the TV show and this was nothing like it except the names of the characters.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great read from the start. You will be pleased the book is long, you get so attached to the various story lines and charactors. Happy reading
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I bought it because i expected a transformers spin-off but it wasn't. Thankfully it wasn't a GI Joe spin-off either, or so i guess since i couldn't watch more than a few minutes of it--no army officer can or will walk around with a day beard without reprisals.<br />Anyway back to Battleship, i say it  is a mix of Steven Spielburg and George Lucus with James Cameron directing. It starts out fairly slow, 20 minutes or so,  enough it made me wonder about its a value, but it is worth it and understandable  when BANG it takes off with the best alien vs. man fight ever, or so i think.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Love it! Fun way to pass time in the waiting room at the doctor's office or just to relieve boredom.
B00932AA5G|5.0|very good, enjoyed it a lot.  highly recommend. watch it. swedish.  lucky guy.  need more movies like this from amazon please
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|If you like strategy games, this is one you should try. This is a man's game for sure, sorry ladies! It's all about how to plan and conduct a war. Graphics are good although I wish I could do the shooting! My only suggestion is to allow automatic coin deposits rather than having to touch each income source...gets kinds yada yada after the 100th time.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I enjoyed the time I spent with this movie.  I must admit TLJ is a favorite and Meryl Streep... you can't go wrong with her!  good movie!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|&#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; was entertaining and light.  If you like Glee then you will enjoy this movie.  It was funny, cute, and of course had a predictable ending; good, clean fun.

B0085A9HXS|4.0|Not for kids.  This film is a non-stop ballet of pornographic violence.  It is so well done you can't stop watching, and the music score really keeps you pulled in.  Like seeing a car wreck on the highway, you just can't look away.

I'm pretty sure most readers that are thinking about starting a business or venturing into the world of entrepreneurship think of the mountain of prep needed to start there venture.

B005LAIHSG|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie. We have watched it several times. Loved the step mom. This movie was full of action.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|A great tale which brings you into a period of English history as part of a government agency gone somewhat awry. Strong female lead character draws you into her tale and gabs hold tight. A great read.
0062082353|3.0|Every so often I like to read biographies. Chris Kyle's account of being a prolific sniper during four tours in Iraq is the story of his personal development as a Navy SEAL, a husband and father, and a person. While the descriptions were for the most part gripping, I had a hard time reconciling the author's claims of being a devout Christian with his chest-thumping expressions of pride each time he felled another insurgent with a single shot. He describes his love of fighting, whether bar fights, hazing of other new recruits, or carrying out his duties in the war zone. When he comes home again, he's still getting into bar fights, defending waitresses, and so on. Ultimately I was left with the feeling that this was more a case of arrested development than development.

B0089Q1TPM|5.0|This is my favorite comedy movie of all time, so it's pretty obvious that I'm happy it came out on Blu-Ray and that it was at such a great price.  The special features are great.  If you like this movie, this is money well spent.
B009VL299E|2.0|the good-  the song line up was great. no load, no reload, no st anger.  alot of death magnetic,and some classics.  only bad thing about the song line up is that they played enter sandman AGAIN...... im soooooo sick of that song.<br /><br />the bad- you really couldnt see much because it was shot with very little light. so alot of it is in the dark.  and the editing was sooooo bad. it made it unwatchable. every 2 seconds the camera shot would change. and it just kept going on and on like that, ANNOYING.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is exactly what I was looking for. I have had no problems with it. like the large number pad.

B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man is another awesome Mitch Rapp thriller by Vince Flynn. An old nemesis from Mitch's past is back.
0451209338|5.0|I am so I glad i found this author! I used to be a fan of Vince Flynn, but Mitch rapp is a bit too unbelievable. this is a slightly more 'high brow&#34; thriller than the Brad Thor or Flynn novels.
B0046MOVD0|4.0|I love this franchise.  The movies are action packed, fun and infinitely re-watchable.  I feel the same about the \\"Aliens\\" franchise.  As great as these franchises are, they both have one thing in common; one installment that is good but not great and doesn't really do anything except ride the coattails of the other installments.  For me, \\"Afterlife\\" was that installment just as Aliens 3 was in that franchise.  It was fun but it just seemed to be the first part of a whole.  It's as if the movie they wanted to make was to long, so they chopped it in half with that big monsterous zombie axe and released it as a stand alone installment.  I gave it a four because it is almost awsome.  One thing I hated was the Matrix copycat scenes.  Resident Evil is good enough that they don't need to copy someone elses decade old idea.<br /><br />Note: I did not see it in 3D so take that into account when reading my review.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you loved Hunger Games, you will also love Catching Fire.  Part 2 expounds on all of the important themes, and takes everything up a notch -- while never sacrificing the groundedness of the central character, Katniss.  She is as realistic as ever.  Some compelling new characters are introduced, as well.  It has some of the similarities of the first book, yet everything about it has change, as it should, as a result of being in the Hunger Games.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I really like it. It's just like pinball. I also like the designs of the tables. The only thing is the are not very many leavels

B009CPJHY4|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a thoroughly enjoy flick with solid ccting, especially Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, and Maggie Smith. The storyline is also pretty believable as more Brits and Americans look beyond their home counties to find a place to retire that is actually affordable. The screen writers capture a range of characters and reactions -- and show the growth of the characters over time, allowing viewers to identify with the pain, confusion, and sometimes anger of coping with culture shock and with the shock of finding one's self at a new stage in life when everything they knew and counted on has changed. The depiction of India is somewhat stereotyped, but no more than would be expected as the background for any 2 hr film and the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sound, the crowdedness, and the exotica of a wholly unknown culture fairly realistic. (I also just LOVE that for once one of the romantic couples is cast with the female actor quite a bit older than the male instead of the other way around -- rather than introduce a spoiler, I'll just say that this couple includes Judi Dench.) It's about time that film makers realized that literate films with older actors in a storyline that nature audiences can identify with can result in a engaging film and appeal to a broad audience -- the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a winner.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down, it was just a wonderful storyline and the development of characters was well done. Can't wait to read the next one
B009CGAZGW|5.0|Holiday fun for the whole family.  When acting was actually and art and not special effects. Great classic movie fun
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was clearly written by a man and is trying to convince women to &#34;enjoy abuse&#34;. The story line was flat and the writing was poor. However they clearly have enough money for advertising to convince the public is actually a &#34;story.&#34;
B009JBZH54|5.0|The price was great the movies are great and the special fx are great what else can you say I am Batman
B004J1DBJI|4.0|I would have given it a 5 if the math would work on some level without Wifi.  It is a good app for math and science.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Needed a reader for reading PDF's from work on my Android tablet.  Tried several different ones but has the best features for scrolling and easy  navigation.  definitely recommend it.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|Matilda is a genius; however, she grows up in conditions that are certainly less than ideal. Her parents consider her to be an annoyance and mostly ignore her. She finally gets to go to school (her parents enroll her late, though she taught herself to read at an early age) and has to deal with the sinister headmistress at the school. Fortunately, the teacher for her class is very kind and caring. Matilda develops telekinetic powers and uses these to fight off the bullies around her, for her good, and that of her friends. The film has a satisfying ending that will leave you smiling.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I enjoyed this film.  It's about a 38 year old man who has never had to work a day in his life.  Through a series of oddly linked events, he becomes close with a 12 year old boy who is bullied in school.  Their relationship becomes almost older brother/younger brother like, as Will (38) tries to help Marcus (12) become cool, with varying degrees of success.<br /><br />It's funny in places and heart breaking in others.  Hugh Grant, who plays Will, puts on a great performance - even when you want to dislike his character, it's hard.<br /><br />Side note: Natalia Tena, who plays Nymphadora Tonks in Harry Potter, is in this movie!<br /><br />Trigger warning: Marcus' mom struggles with depression, and at one point in the movie, tries to commit suicide.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I had heard a lot about this series and so decided to download to my Kindle. The storyline kept me completely engaged and in suspense. LOVED IT!!!!!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a great novel adaptation with almost all of the tweaks enhancing the story, rather than detracting from it.  The only change I didn't like is with Stuart's character and the ending of his storyline.<br /><br />The actors did terrific jobs and gave fantastic performances, especially Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer.  Bryce Dallas Howard was almost unrecognizable and did a phenomenal job bringing Hilly Holbrook to life.<br /><br />At times is hard to remember this is solely a work of fiction - it seems like it could be based on actual events.

B008MM9630|3.0|I like this game so far. Unlike other farming games I have played, not only do you earn coins for completing tasks you also earn diamonds /gems that can be used for the \\"exclusive \\" items. Most other games I have played you have to spend real money to get the \\"diamonds /gems /farm cash \\". Makes it a more enjoyable game.  My only negative comment (and it is a minor one)  is that on the ad for the game they have a beautiful fairy but your actual character is not very attractive. Like I said, very minor complaint.<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br /><br />I still enjoy the game but after playing a while I noticed some things that bugged me.  Sometimes it is hard to harvest etc. because it will not register that you tapped it.  Also if you tap something to see how long till you harvest, if it doesn't work and then you tap again,sometimes it will charge you a gem thinking you wanted to speed up growth.  Also, it should be titled Witch Farm as it is more about making potions and spells.  One last thing that I don't like is you make these potions and spells and there is no explanation on what to do with it after completed.  You can't sell or use or anything.  It just sits in your storage.  After playing a while I would give 2.5 stars.
B005EI86JU|5.0|This book is much better than the reference manual for the D7000.  It explains the whys and how of the options on the camera.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This Highlights album is full emotion and power. &#34;I Dreamed A Dream&#34; will certainly be remembered for years. This album fits in well with all the rest.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|A soundtrack or cast recording should convey the atmosphere of the film or show without the visuals. As with most of the cast recordings of \\"Les Miserables\\" whether it be the original Broadway Cast or the symphonic recording, this is the case. When it comes to the original soundtrack, there seems to be something missing. Granted, I have not seen the visuals but from the songs I have heard... it is hit and miss.<br /><br />The weakest orchestration and weakest vocals are in the comedy relief, \\"Master of the House.\\" I don't feel the chemistry between the Thenardiers nor do I feel that Sacha Baron Cohen is putting much emphasis into the role at least, vocally. Once again, Helena Bonham Carter delivers an uninspiring and lethargic vocal performance as was shown in \\"Sweeney Todd.\\"<br /><br />Hugh Jackman offers beautiful renditions full of enrichment and emotion. You can feel the struggle for hope and freedom from his past through his vocals. The new song \\"Suddenly\\" is very endearing and absorbing. Out of all characterizations, you can connect with Valjean through his vocals.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is not as powerful as on stage. The song is done with a shine of hope in a world she is trapped in where all she has been given has been struggle and a dead end. Anne Hathaway can sing and her emotions express a desire of freedom from her life which has been marked with misery.<br /><br />Russell Crowe simply does not carry the impact or fierce desperation vocally as other Javerts. When listening to other recordings, I could hear the desperation of his search for Valjean but on the recording, it comes off flat.<br /><br />As far as the orchestrations, they are lush and robust. There is a grand orchestra backing up the cast and for the most part sounds marvelous!<br /><br />As far as Universal releasing a highlights only album, it was either ignorance on their part or a shrewd marketing ploy. Perhaps they are offering a tease to generate income and thenlater on will offer a complete recording to generate more revenue. Regardless, not a clever idea especially when the world known score is incomplete on a recording sold to promote the film. It was surprising \\"Can You Hear the People Sing\\" was left out of the CD package.<br /><br />All in all, this is an interesting addition to the family of \\"Les Miserables\\" Recordings but not the best representation of the score.-Tony Medina
B00ARAO720|3.0|This movie would be a good TV movie.<br /><br />Pros:  Lots of biking action with on the edge of your seat most of the movie.  Actors were good.<br /><br />Cons:  Not much to the movie, simple plot with holes.
B009CGYO0K|1.0|I actually purchased this book and if I had been smart I would have read it in the book store and left it there.  While a small portion of this book was interesting and humerous, the majority was not.  Lesson learned.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Best of all the R. E. brand. Has more action than than the previous stories. The reverse slow motion opening sequence was great and Milla Jovovich was hotter than ever.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I found this book to be one of the best of the Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child collaborations!  It has a great storyline and the suspenseful writing that keeps you reading to the wee hours of the morning!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This is a step down from the previous Bourne editions. Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon and the story line was very weak. Just an average action flick.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked this book. It was very sad in places but a very good read. If you enjoy books about the Irish and the country you will enjoy this book.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|HIgh action thriller. Much better production than Arnold's version back in the 80's. CGA was great and the action was terrific. Colin Farrell did another credible job in the lead role and the ladies were great.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|Pretty funny scenes in the movies between all three brothers. Add three Kinks songs in the mix and I enjoyed it
B007MU85D0|5.0|What a great debut album.  Like most people, I was drawn to this by Little Talks and a great deal on Amazon.  I am so glad I made the purchase.<br /><br />While Little Talks is still my favorite, they've surrounded it with a full complement of other great songs.  This is an album I could listen to every day and still find something new to like.  From start to finish, this album shines.  It flows well from song to song and I'm tempted to start it all over again when it's finished.<br /><br />I really like this album and if it's not the album of the year, it's neck and neck with some great ones.
B00A80SHFM|2.0|It's obvious that Les Miserables is doing a whole new take on movie musicals. This movie is going for realism and grittiness, not pretty singing and perfect pitch. And I'm fine with that. However, this grittier style doesn't really transfer well onto the highlights CD.<br /><br />The highlights CD lacks some numbers: \\"Lovely Ladies\\", \\"Come to Me\\", \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\", etc. It's disappointing to see those numbers go, but it's as to be expected since most Les Mis highlights CD rarely incldue those songs anyway. However, I don't understand why \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" was cut seeing as it's one of the biggest songs in the entire show. And for some reason, \\"The Bishop\\" makes it onto this CD, even though I don't view it as one of the major songs of the movie, so I don't know how this song made it onto the CD and DYHTPS didn't. Don't get me wrong, Colm Wilkinson's great as the bishop, I just don't understand why this is a song on the CD and other songs didn't make it on here.<br /><br />The tracks on this CD are straight from the movie. Unfortunately, this doesn't really work well. I wish they'd just done a polished studio recording and released that instead. Because without the visuals of the movie, this CD does not work at all.<br /><br />First of all, the sound mixing isn't very good. All the background noises (rain, various bumps and bangs and noises, etc.) seem obnoxiously loud and really detract from the music itself. If they'd at least had the time to mix the sound better and muffle the background noise, maybe the CD would have been a tad better.<br /><br />My thoughts on the singers/actors:<br /><br />HUGH JACKMAN (Valjean): I have mixed feelings for him. On one hand, he's not a bad singer. But on this recording, he just doesn't sound good. It's like he put more effort into his acting than his singing. In a movie musical, there needs to be more of a balance. His voice sounds very shrill and nasally at some points and he seems to speak-sing...a lot. I'm sure it's one of those things that will work out much better on screen, but for now, it just seems like an overuse of speak-singing. However, he's not the worst of the cast, so for now, he's just \\"okay.\\"<br /><br />RUSSELL CROWE (Javert): Definitely the weakest singer of the whole cast. I'm hoping his acting is good in the movie, because his voice is definitely not. He's not painfully terrible, but by no means is he good. He has no rhythym in his singing. Everything just seems to be staccato and he never holds out any of his notes. His voice has a flat noise and it sounds like he's singing in the back of his throat. As Javert, he lacks any vocal power.<br /><br />ANNE HATHAWAY (Fantine): She was a big surprise for me, when the first trailer came out, as I was expecting her to be the weakest of the cast. She's definitely not. Her \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is frail and fragile, as it should be, given the context, but there's also a hint of vocal power behind it. Unfortunately, we don't get to hear much of her, since she gets one solo and a few mini-solos in \\"At the End of the Day.\\" I do wish she had cried a little less, though.<br /><br />SACHA BARON COHEN and HELENA BONHAM CARTER (Thenardier and Madame Thenardier): Neither of them are the best singers on the album, and that's fine, because this isn't a role that requires amazing vocal skills. They sound rather quiet in their big number \\"Master of the House\\", but, again, it's one of those things that might transfer better on screen. Overall, both are fine as the Thenardiers, though I wish Baron Cohen hadn't put on such a fake, cheesy-sounding accent.<br /><br />AMANDA SEYFRIED (Cosette): Definitely the weakest female vocalist. She honestly makes me glad Cosette doesn't have a bigger role. At first, I thought the light, ariy tone to her voice would be perfect for Cosette (a nice change from the usually very-operatic sounding Cosettes.) Unfortunately, Seyfried has a very shrill voice and terrible vibrata.<br /><br />EDDIE REDMAYNE (Marius): Probably the strongest male singer, along with Aaron Tveit. He has a very strong voice and he acted the heck out of \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" with his voice alone.<br /><br />SAMANTHA BARKS (Eponine): She's the strongest female singer, which doesn't come as a surprise, since she's a musical theatre actress, is used to singing live, and has played the role of Eponine before. Her \\"On My Own\\" is beautifully done. It's not belted, but I like that, because sometimes, a belted \\"On My Own\\" gets annoying. Her take on the song is quiet, reflective, and her voice sounds beautiful.<br /><br />AARON TVEIT (Enjolras): Another strong singer in the group and one that's been painfully overlooked. He may not have the typical powerhouse voice that people may be expecting from Enjolras, but still, he has a very good voice and really has a commanding prescence in \\"Red and Black.\\"<br /><br />ENSEMBLE: The ensemble is a nice surprise here. As many of the ensemble members have been in Les Mis before, it's no surprise to find that they're all very strong singers and they're a lot of fun to listen to. They're probably one of the best parts of the recording.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay recording of Les Mis. But taking the songs directly from the movie doesn't work well on this CD and many of the singers are less than stellar (here's hoping their acting makes up for it!) Not a recommended recording.AYNE (Marius): Probably the strongest male singer, along with Aaron Tveit.

1892005034|5.0|A good book to study and learn from.  Marshall has it laid out well.  It is good for group work.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|They all look a little older but the magic that is LED ZEPPLIN is still there. Jason Bonham is amazing.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|I read the reviews before I purchased this and it looked really different and interesting.  The idea was certainly good and very different.  However, I found the writing very amateurish.  Having said that, I wanted to find out what happened in the end but it was rather childish and very one-dimensional.  I felt it was written for the 14/15 year old market.  What was annoying was that it could have been so much better, so much more thought out, so much more exciting and a lot darker - a lost idea and a lost opportunity.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|kind of boring.  could of been better.  don't watch late at night or you won't make it while awake.  if was free would be worth the money.
B006LSZECO|4.0|For most of the book, she really had me hooked. This is great mind-candy, good page-turner. The reason I could not give it 5 stars is because she just couldn't pull the book together for an ending that suited the rest of the story. It was completely anticlimactic.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Pretty intense game just wish it was free well at least<br />One of the g5 games because the all rock!!!!
0739352962|5.0|am now listening while driving, and Into the second book. In any audiobook, the reader is of the first importance and this one is ideal for these books.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was a fun, light, entertaining book.  The characters lacked depth and the book could have benefitted from an extra 50 pages fleshing the characters out a little better, or at least as much time as was spent fleshing out Google :)  I am conflicted about the ending.  In one way, it was a bit of a letdown, mainly because I was hoping for more tales about the bookstore and hopefully getting to know the characters in much more depth.  On the other hand, I am quite tired of everyone's first book being The First in the So and So Series!  That always makes me groan, and I am so glad to read a stand alone novel whenever possible.  I just wish we had gotten to know the characters a lot more.  It's a good book and worth reading overall.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|So far this season has not disappointed me, and I doubt that it it ever will. I look forward to each show.

B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|i think this would only be liked if you knew what Halo is, what the series consists of, and have played the video games as well. for new actors (most of them are quite young), it was well done and seeing master chief on screen and not as an animation was VERY cool to experience. watched it twice already and may watch it again.
1932100660|5.0|This book, along with others like \\"Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease\\" and \\"Eat to Live\\" are books that have both inspired and piqued my interest in nutrition and its correlation to my health that I gave up meat and dairy a year ago and have had so much change for the better: weight loss, improved skin, energy, blood work all great (even B12 and protein). I think one of the reasons this topic rubs some folks the wrong way is that it's asking us to take a second look at what we love/are addicted to: what we eat. Food is such a personal topic that I think  some people get easily offended when suggestions are made toward change. If you want to buy this book, expect to be presented a lot of eye-opening information that will have you re-evaluate how you eat. If you are a critic of this book, picking apart tidbits of this and that, I just want to give you the confused face that reads \\"I don't understand what the big deal is.\\" How does eating natural fruits and vegetables in their unprocessed state translate as negative? This book is not advertising for a drug or even supplement. It is not even saying the word VEGAN. Back to the potential buyer, I highly recommend this book and if you feel inspired, give the recommendations a TRY - I assure you that you will feel better.
B0038KSEVQ|5.0|i re-watched this with my little sister and loved it just as much as i did the first time. quality horror. can't wait for the new one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not having read the books,  I was reticent to see thismovie,unfairly thinking it was another&#34;Twilight&#34; bore.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  Intelligently writen, well acted and wonderfullly acted this movie deserves the hype.  I have since read the books and look forward to the next additions.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|what i was really surprised by, in this movie, was the amazing quality of the graphics. if you know anything about making or editing movies, the detail pixar was able to put in simple things, like the main character's hair, was out of this world. the storyline was kinda childish but i still really liked watching it and i'm pretty sure i'll be watching more than twice.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|It is worth spending the extra money to buy Canon brand when it comes to camera batteries.  I previously purchased a cheaper battery that did not hold a charge.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|without giving anything away, no spoiler alert here, this was worth every penny and i've watched it i think four times already? i'll be sure to watch it a few more times i'm sure. excellent addition to the alien series and noomi rapace, will you marry me? haha....no seriously the graphics were amazing and the acting made you forget you were watching a movie.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Give me Season 2. Just WOW. Now I know what the big fuss was about. Streaming it is a great way to really enjoy it, so I don't mind waiting.
B005MMYEF8|5.0|a short few episodes to spartacus that revealed a lot of the questions that you had during season 1 like, how did they get to be the individuals that they are in season 1. excellent acting even by the new character ganacus (not sure of the spelling on his name) but he fit right into the previous cast. definitely don't miss it if you enjoyed spartacus seasons 1 and 2.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  The interaction between Mark Wahlberg and Ted is unbelievably funny.<br /><br />The creepy guy with the kid that want to take Ted didn't seem to work with the flow of the movie very well, but<br />I would highly recommend watching for yourself.
B004E5GG50|5.0|Superb acting, stunning scenery, sets & costumes.  It appears to be fairly accurate historically and the writers have done a wonderful job filling in the blanks.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|If you liked the Alien's serious, you'll love Prometheus.  The movie was so entertaining, and it kept us questioning everything we knew.  We watched it three times in the first week we bought it.  We are huge Alien's fans and went back and re-watched the original series and loved how they were tied into one another, yet were left open and wondering about more sequels.  Technology today is so good, all the scenes are so realistic.  I hope they come out with something else.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|This is a good site for getting a variety of news, but unlike the Bloomberg Android App for phones, doesn't seem to have a page for markets and/or individual securities.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Not a huge fan of Kristen Stewart, I think she has the same mannerisms and acting style no mater what character she's playing, but Charlize Theron and Chris Hemingway are amazing.  This is a great version too on the story.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicle.  The series is terrific.  I particularly like how the story is told...through the main character recounting his life for a scribe.  I can't wait for the next and final installment!

B0076DCT2G|3.0|As a big DeMille fan, I've found his recent books, and expecially this one, to be predictable and surprisingly dull. In this one, most of the book is devoted to the main and secondary characters doing and saying things that they've done and said before. Rather then showing us anything new about characters we like, DeMille just has them go on and on and on in the same old, same old way, until they come across as tedious and annoying. For those many of us who have read all the other books, we know what John Corey is like. We don't need for this to be established and repeated every other page. Maybe have him do something interesting...?  or surprise us? Frankly, I'm worried about this writer and this series of books, because I used to love them but now find each new one to be duller and more repetitive than the one before. \\"The Panther\\" was, to me, a retread and a disappointment. The excitement and magic are gone.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Totally addictive. Love it. So does my six year old, though he needs a little help from time to time.
B001EBYM8U|5.0|This is a great movie. Denzel goes beyond his usual roles to play the villain and does a great job.
B005Z6YHEY|4.0|I enjoyed the book but I would have some of the slower parts to be more appendixed than in the main chapters. Stories of success are good to read, but more how to elements would have been good.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I enjoyed this game completely.  it glitched a bit on a couple of screens when trying to tap but otherwise excellent.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I found that the movie was over done with the special effects, but yet very little story line that made hard to draw you into it.<br />I falling a sleep on it 3 time. Then just gave up looking at it.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|The book purports to describe the preparations of the assault team for the raid on Osama bin Lauden's hideout. While it tells a story, the rush to publication resulted in low quality writing which seriously detracts from the overall satisfaction of reading it. If and when a well-written description appears this volume will be of little appeal. Until then,m it is all we have of a truly historical event.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|First full 3d movie ever seen, totaly worth it, but some how it feesl like there is more to achive on 3d movies.
B000YDE4AU|3.0|These boots are of pretty good quality.  The stitching is well done without any loose threads.  The size is a bit large compared to what I would have expected.  Also, the neck of the boot will rub against your leg in an uncomfortable manner, so wear thicker than normal socks.  (Maybe this is issue as I am in Texas and the warm weather usually has me in thin socks.<br /><br />The sole appears to be thinner than I would have liked, with tread in softer rubber that looks like it will wear down faster than the rest of the boot.  I anticipate having to make a trip to the cobbler to get a new sole at some point.<br /><br />Would also note, these are not made in the USA.  Does not matter for me, but there seem to be many who want to buy American for work boots.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|This is the best witch movie that I have every seen<br />I gave it the five star rating cause I loved the powers and the romance<br />I would recommend this movie to every one who is into sci fi movies
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is so much fun and its addicting. Well worth my money! Really coop strategy and critical thinking game.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I just love all the action in it.<br />I gave it a five star rating because of the actor Alex Pettyfer and all the action<br />I loved the whole movie<br />I would tell all my friends and family to get this movie.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I read every book and watched the films ten years all to get to the final battle...and it was glorious.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|An American classic that I bought for my 3-year-old great niece (who happens to be musical). She really enjoys it.
B00138J6VM|4.0|It's easy for the casual fan to focus on the hits &#34;Walk This Way&#34; and &#34;Sweet Emotion,&#34; even those who came to discover this band after RUN-DMC remade that song the way I did.  But listen to deeper cuts like &#34;No More No More,&#34; &#34;Adam's Apple,&#34; and the racy &#34;Big Ten Inch Record&#34; and you'll realize that this band, whether in this early version or its modern day, is a great rock 'n' roll band.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I really just wanted a normal DVD version of this classic film. Incredibly, you can't buy just a DVD--Blue Ray is the only option unless you get this package deal with the DVD AND the Blue Ray.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Could the surviving members team with the late drummer's son to re-create the old magic of the (possibly) greatest rock 'n' roll band ever?  Ooh yeah!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|An amazing book with many twists and turns throughout the book. I think that this might be the best one yet.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Any doubts the fans might have had about Tom Cruise being able to carry off another Mission Impossible have been erased (or detonated) after seeing this.  A prison break, secret infiltration, comic relief from Simon Pegg and the glitchy equipment, and twists and turns all down the line make this an A+ effort.  Plus the tower climbing scene and the little revelations about Ethan's past add to the tension.  Well done.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was very nice and I have no interest in reading yet I finished this book faster than any book ever so that is pretty AMAZING
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A very well done book. Engaging characters, with a lot Of humor. I didn't want to put it down. Hope he writes more.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I find the UI a bit dodgy. Not all the right information seems to be exposed or obvious, forcing me to navigate around more than I'd prefer.
B001QVFDA4|4.0|Well written. Well performed. Well paced. Great time from start to finish. I truly hope Guy Ritchie makes a sequel.
1455522597|5.0|This latest John Corey adventure was long overdue.  I think I liked the two &#34;Lion&#34; books the better but any John Corey read is fantastic...keep them coming DeMille.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Wonderful movie that played great with no problems. I definitely recommend this dvd for your purchase. A very reasonble cost.
B000KJT8IG|1.0|How could anyone think this movie is funny is beyond me. I purchased it based on the numerous positive reviews... what a let down. Even the cable guy is funny next to this. Badly acted, clumsy, badly aged, miserable movie, that's what this is. I smiled once at the end of the movie, but even then, it was just a smile. You see everything coming 10mn before it happens, there is no wit. You are supposed to watch the main character make a stupid face during a minute and find it funny. Pepople here talk about sarcasm... sarcasm? What's sarcastic is that anyone would find this funny. You could show this movie to the public in \\"idiocracy\\", and yes, they would have a good laugh... Plus it is not something you would want to show young kids in my opinion. My 12 year old daugther said at the end that she hated that movie, it was too negative, boring, and had nothing to do with Christmas. So there you go, try to see it to make your own mind, but don't spend a cent on it.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|I couldn't figure out how to operate this game.  I couldn't get it to go on the track. I lost interest in it because it just went around the track.  I did not like it.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I recently discovered Pentatonix, and immediately fell in love with them and their sound. When I saw that they have a Christmas album, I listened to the whole album, and then I bought it. To my surprise, I hit it on a day when they had a major discount, so that doubled my pleasure, so to speak! ;)<br /><br />Anyway, it's my favorite &#34;new&#34; Christmas album... need I say more?<br /><br />These artists are A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! They are the most unique group in years!<br /><br />Jo Henton<br />One happy customer
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Insulation does not flake off like the original OEM supplied cable.i am disappointed in Amazon for supplying such a poor original cable, but the new one gives no indication of the same problem as the original. Time will tell which is why I can only give it 4 stars for now?
B0013YPEMG|5.0|I have always loved this film. If you are a fan of the hyper realism of the Nolan films and expect that every superhero film should be grounded in as much reality as possible, then be ready to be disappointed. As a child I was mesmerized by how epic this movie was. As an adult I continue to admire its charm. If you we're to watch this film for one reason alone, it should be to witness the oozing charisma of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. If you ask me why I continue to watch it, I could tell you several reasons, but one of the main ones would be the beautiful score by Danny Elfman. The pacing of this movie is operatic in musical, emotional and narrative terms. For me, there is a point in the second act where I feel there a turning point where every barrier in my mind that wants to ground the events of the story in reality and plausibility finally give up. It is then when I feel that the conflict between Batman and the Joker is not just one between a murdering psychopath and a masked vigilante, but rather one between two titans who were fated to collide.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed it so much,  we watced it 3xs in 48hrs. The movie is primarily about relationships, whether they're family, friends or work associates and communicating w/the people (or characters) in our lives. Not quite enough baseball if ya love the game, but enough to make the movie work. Opening scene leaves a little to be desired but it does set the tone; And speaking of tone...some great music.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I thought this video was well done and had excellent values exemplified for men. I liked the plot, and I liked seeing how each family in the video lived out their values. I would recommend this to all men 17 years old and older.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love how many games there are except ... it DOESN'T TELL U HOW TO PLAY THEM!!! But other than that vvery fun
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Good old movie, just right for a family with teenagers!  Not as funny as Christmas with the Kranks, but almost!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Not exactly like Sigh No More, but this is a wonderful album.  I love it!  It is one of my favorite second albums of all time.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Though there are not too many moving parts the apps simplicity is its best feature. it informs you of what is relevant. What and how much time do I have.I have been trying out the free version before buying the full version and this one I will have to pay for.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I liked this app. it was a good app for passing time and also sharpening my mind at the same time
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|this game is good i like it but there is this problem where i shut off my kindle went back to dragonvale but could not get in it takes me straight to the app info. page and i press open. but it does nothing.so i try to uninstall it. guess what, the kindle says we could not find this app in the installed apps, wtf!?  i am annoyed
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Well worth the read, you just have to find out who done it! If you have read the first two you can't quit now.
1449410243|5.0|It wasn't at all what I expected, as I purchased it.  It is now my coffee table favorite.  It is an eye catcher; along with being very funny.  The author has a keen sense of humor.  With having ten cats; I should know.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I think the first in the series was the best of them, but this was really good too.  You should read this one as well.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|I love this movie and I couldn't find it anywhere for a cheap price.  I got it and it played like a charm without any bugs or bothers
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed Marvel comics as a child and these movies bring that enjoyment into the 21st century. I hope I get this as a present for Chrismas. The instant view rental on Amazon worked flawlessly.
B004H83IM8|4.0|Its everything I wanted! But for some reason they thought it was a good idea to put &#34;Spy Who Shagged Me&#34; on its own disk & &#34;International Man Of Mystery&#34;/&#34;Goldmember&#34; together on the other disk... Its just weird.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Just realizing that my father is probably in the early stages of alzheimers. This is an amazing book to give perspective from the patients point of view.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this app... easy and fun to play just like in the arcades.  My kids think it is fun too!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|the movie was grate put i cant download it and that sucks. it is BS that you need eight more words
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is wonderful to have the Bible with you wherever you go. One great feature is that you can download your favorite translation so that you can access the entire Bible even when you're not in a wifi area.  My children love the feature that you can select to have the verses read to you. If you are not very familiar with the order of the books of the Bible, you can select for them to be listed alphabetically, making each book easy to find.ya
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Unsatisfying remake.  Good CGI, though, and lots of (confusing) action and noise. The directior was focuse on the &#34;Wow,! Look what we can do now!&#34; to the detriment of all else.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great gameplay. Clear card movement.  I really like the touch to move option. It makes for really fast times. I recommend.
B001AW9DKK|5.0|Never can go wrong with these guys.  Great mix of old and new tunes, sweetness and fury, love and war.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was a great read.  There were a few electronic issues (repeated paragraphs and typos) but the actual story itself was a great novel!!!!
B005PK553C|5.0|This show is absolutely wonderful! :3 I love it. And the quality of the product was exceptional. It gave me no difficulties whatsoever!
1906355630|5.0|Prior to reading Adrian's book I was soon to be one of the many lawyers who start a Twitter account and then give up, proclaiming Twitter a waste of time.  The 90 minutes it took me to read this book is the most valuable 90 minutes I have devoted to my practice this year, perhaps ever.  Adrian is a great storyteller and the practical advice is mixed with humor and real-world success stories.  Though I had no meaningful experience with social media, Adrian's teachings quickly made sense of Twitter, and illustrated what I had been doing wrong.<br /><br />Thankfully, Adrian's book does not assume the reader is technologically adept or experienced with social media.  Though I would recommend the book to anyone interested in using Twitter, Adrian's approach is geared perfectly to its intended audience - lawyers.  I now understand that using Twitter is not a new approach to business development, but rather another tool lawyers can use to engage and build relationships. Twitter is a better and more efficient way of doing the things that lawyers have always valued.  Adrian's book does a remarkable job of introducing Twitter and its potential to an inherently skeptical group.<br /><br />I read Adrian's book several months ago and its impact on my practice has transcended anything I could have imagined.  Though I have a lot to learn, I now appreciate the potential of Twitter and have become, at least relatively speaking, digitally relevant.<br /><br />Well done Adrian, and thanks. @EricJGuerin
1849904251|5.0|Perfect for a fan of the series, this was a  Christmas present for my mom. My family is now fighting for who will read it next.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Hands down the best new show this season.  I keep forgetting to program my DVR, so I enjoy the show on my Kindle Fire.
B003AJVXZO|3.0|As much as I like the classic movie, the CGI in this version seems kinda... pointless. There really aren't that many scenes done inf Full CGI- at least not enough to make it worthwhile to remake the movie. I would rather have seen the entire film remastered in CGI. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge GITS fan- but remastering seems pretty much pointless for the few scenes they spliced in.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|this application is very useful and actually pretty good.<br />I had to uninstall it as you get bombarded with advertising, I can accept some but they really overdue it
B00012QM8G|5.0|Without question one of the most important films ever made and a masterpeice of acting and filmaking, and like all of the best movies ( except maybe The Godfather) is almost all a true story with elements cleaned up for ease of narration.<br />Those who complain about the dramatization should realize that every big budget film must have elements that make it compatible for mass audience appeal in order to be made. Spielberg just does not make documentaries. It's just not realistic. Also many negative reviews complain about scenes<br />that were exactly from the book and were factual ( Like the water instead of gas from the shower scene)as reported by the victims. There were a few instances that were inaccurate ( The Germans did not have a 45 mm shell, their were 37 or 50 mm, upto 75 and 88mm and so on.. the 45 is an american caliber, also, The true role of Metiek Pemper was combined with Izak Stern's, Amon Goth was arrested by the ss and sacked for corruption, etc and was gone by the time Oskar moved the factory to Brinnlitz etc...<br /><br />The biggest joke is people complaining about having to get up out of their comfortable seats in the paradise that is modern america and to flip over a disc while watching a true story film about people that underwent the worst horror in human history! Are you kidding?? Bitching about something like that in your nice home munching popcorn while watching a depiction of people being beaten starved and executed, six years of torment and evil, something that REALLY DID HAPPEN!
B004XMMSZG|2.0|I personally love Cablejive products. I've been a fun of their dock conectors and cables. This time I have to say they dropped the ball big time with the DockBoss air. If you own a Bose system do not waste your time and money with this item. After it's paired and you are listening through the Bluetooth system, it only takes 2 to 3 minutes for the DockBoss air to turn off and stop working.....really dissapointing. According to Claire from Cablejive customer service, \\"This version of the dockBoss air has had some issue with the power cycle on the Bose Wave System, we hope to fix this in our next version that is due out in the next 2-3 months.... really? they should post that in their website to advice customers about this. On top of that, you don't get a refund if you return it, only store credit.... think twice before you invest in this...
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The movie arived post haste. The deal was amazing for the product received. Finally got to sit and watch the entire season in the right order.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|great mix of song genre-would have liked a couple of more showstoppers frm rachel-the new cast additions keep the traditiongoing strong
B007EECSFA|5.0|I would recommend this to all my reading friends.  I enjoyed the suspense but did not know what to expect.
B00A50PE6K|3.0|a nice mix but iwish they would do some international carols and more of the traditional english language ones-worth a listen to
0545265355|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, and I find that the book is usually better than the movie. However, this<br />is a Christmas Gift which has not yet been given.
B00138J14Y|5.0|Many panned this lp b/c it followed his super influential classic debut. This album nonetheless has many gems and deep lyrics behind impressive production. Trackmasters and Nasty Nas really got together to put together something truly special.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I saw the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, my purchase was a Christmas Gift, which has not yet been given.<br />I hope it is enjoyed by the recipient.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I purchased this item on the 19/11/12 and was informed that it shipped on the 21/11/12, though I have still not received the item on the 24/12/12. It is an expensive item and I am becoming very anxious that it has not arrived after over a month of waiting. I have been given two different estimates of delivery date from Amazon, the first i was given with the confirmation of purchase email, stating that it would arrive between the 18/12/12 and the 24/12/12 (today) and the second estimate i received came with the message stating that it would arrive on/by the 13/12/12. This was a christmas gift I have bought for another person and is not an inexpensive item. I ordered this with plenty of time for the item to be shipped to me by Christmas and I am deeply unsatisfied and anxious that it has not yet arrived. It is past 5pm on Christmas Eve so there is no possible way that I will receive this in time to give as a present.<br />This is the first thing that I have ordered from Amazon and am beginning to think that I should not purchase anything from Amazon again.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I always enjoy this movie around Christmas. We do not have cable and that is the only stations that are showing this movie. Enjoyed the movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is big enough for me to see the numbers. Everything works pretty well. I'm really enjoying it. I can't complain about any part of the app.
B0096I9UTE|4.0|I would recommend this to all my friends. I liked it, but it could have been a little better with a few  different choice of songs.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|My 2 y/o son watches this every chance he can, and the rest of our family loves this movie as well!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We love Homeland's current season, so decided to check out the back story! We are so hooked!!! Can't wait to see the next show--
0071752854|5.0|Fantastic read for anyone trying to learn how to pitch and also a refreshing and insightful book for anybody who already knows or thinks he/she knows about pitching.
0425263908|1.0|This is a blatant copy of 50 shades.<br /><br />I find it very hard not to finish a book once I start, but this one I just had to abandon.<br />Good grief it is shameful how close this story reads to 50 shades.<br /><br />I agree with MariRockn review:<br />Fifty Shades of Grey Rewritten, May 20, 2012
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Very good book. I am still reading it though. It holds your attention and you want to keep reading on.
1568490119|5.0|I did not read the book as it was given as a Christmas gift.  It was however packed carefully and shipped promptly.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It did not worked. Not please. There needs to have problems fix. I will ever buy this one again. Other I please with all I get.
B00008Z0EX|5.0|EXCELLENT ALBUM. THE VINYL IS THE BEST OPTION FOR HEAR MUSIC. I LOVE THE VINYL. IM LIVE IN ARGENTINA. THANS
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is another fine Van Morrison album.  With this talent and skill set, Van really does not need any 'Plan B'

B00979CS50|2.0|First, I love Neil Young.  His 'Americana' album was just great.  But this album felt like a self-indulgent popurri to me.  Sorry, Neil

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Very funny movie.  If you like Family Guy, this is the movie for you.  The surprise guest stars are great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much!I played it on my ipod touch but its way better on the kindle fire! its a bigger screen and its just better!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle was a good series...can't wait for the next book to come out.  I read them all in about 3 days, couldn't put them down.
B000MKIR80|4.0|I generally like Hugh Jackman and Woody Allen movies, and I thought this was a movie that was definitely worth watching. The beautiful shots of the gardens and of the city of London were a nice addition too! I did not think this movie was quite as good as Midnight in Paris or To Rome with Love, but it was still an interesting story and had great cinematography, writing, and music. I think Scarlett Johansson plays one of her most interesting/complex characters in this movie too, so that was worth watching as well. I think some of the reviews complained about the \\"flatness\\" of Jackman's character, but he really doesn't have much to work with to make himself more dynamic given his supporting part in the movie, so I think some people are just turned off by seeing a movie that includes him NOT acting his heart out.
B001706I5I|4.0|Great funny christmas movie to enjoy with family. Not violent, not scary as long as the way the grinch looks doesn't bother your kids. Not a classic of course but solid enough. Enjoy!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Grand daughter loves it I see her playing with it all the time great item and a great price .
B008469DGY|5.0|No putting just driving!!While the ball is in air you control spin & curve allowing you to steer the ball into the cup.Not easy,not very hard but definitly FUN!!!

B001O5EH40|1.0|The dvd is copy-protected.  An otherwise rather extraordinary release is just mediocre, because the &%$@# at Mute Records release music not only a dvd, but with copy-protection.<br /><br />On a happier note, this more down-tempo than not D.M. release displays some exceptional songwriting and singing long after I wrote them off as dead.  I didn't give them serious interest since Violator.  Wow.<br /><br />Other notes: this is the 2009 European re-issue of the 2007 European collector's edition (cd + dvd) remaster.  So, if you're in dvd region one (U.S., Mexico, etc), when playing the dvd on your computer, you'll need to change the dvd-region to two, and you can only change such five times before the drive locks.  So, going back and forth may be problematic.  FYI...

0143034901|5.0|I found Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon to be a blockbuster novel. Written in 2001 and translated to English in 2004, I can understand why this book was rated number one in Spain for an enduring period of time.The book's construction, it's unique story-line and fascinating characters were compelling. This is truly a fine literary piece of work.

0807014273|5.0|I can truly say this book made me come to grips with the focus of my life.  I have so struggled to make sense of my time on earth and have I made a difference.  Such an important quest comes full circle after reading what happens when all hope is removed.  I have given a copy of this book to both my sons.  I want them to be fulfilled men.
B009X01C64|5.0|There's no such thing as a perfect case for a Kindle Fire, but some come close enough that almost perfect is all that one needs. There are many different ones available for the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" series, but this one stands out in terms of versatility, quality of construction, and pure functionality.<br /><br />Picking this [[ASIN:B009X01C64 Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\"]] was an easy choice based on past experience with products from this company, and this one clearly has lived up to their expected standards. My first was their [[ASIN:B0079R8KO0 Marware Vibe Case Cover with Stand]] for the 1st generation Kindle Fire, and that one is still in service today. What I found impressive with that one was the variety of positions with which it can be used, and in that it actually exceeded expectations.<br /><br />But first here are the subjective pro and con points on this new Marware Revolve Case, then the observations as an owner.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />+ Case revolves; offers 180° rotation for full port access while inside case<br />+ Protective shell; rotates to stand device in either portrait or landscape position<br />+ Functional; has three different viewing angles.<br />+ Automatic sleep &wake lid; turns device on/off, even when rotated 180 degrees<br />+ Snap-in mounting system; holds the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" securely, no flimsy little elastic straps<br />+ Ports: easy access to charging and HDMI ports while inside case, even closed<br />+ Ergonomic design; adjusts easily to comfortable typing and viewing positions<br />+ Innovative Hand Strap<br />+ Interior hand strap; good for one-handed use when on the go<br />+ Cover offers good protection for the screen; easy to clean<br />+ Elastic strap; holds the cover closed without interference<br />+ Durable leather case; lined with soft microfiber interior<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Slightly thick, but understandable with a revolving case like this<br /><br />Observations:<br /><br />It would be wise to read the installation directions on this case carefully, as it will help in understanding how to snap it into the plastic shell. Once installed, the plastic shell enclosure on this case not only holds the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" tablets securely without the flimsy little elastic straps found in some cases, it allows the device to snaps into place and doesn't mar the surface, as I've found in previous models from other companies.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The movie was a waste of money.  I love Family Guy and American Dad but this movie was not funny and very stupid....I cannot understand why so many people liked it.
B007EDYN36|4.0|As a lifelong KISS fan, it really hurt to read a lot of what Peter wrote here. Yes, he's very bitter toward Paul, Gene and Ace. And yes, he admits that he's been bitter toward himself. It also makes me feel disillusioned about what I -- and millions of other KISS fans -- had grown to believe about KISS, from uncredited studio musicians on albums to doctored \\"live\\" albums to the band's flagrant commercial appeal, which has been very forced upon us, to being very unfair to the musicians who helped bring KISS to where it is today.<br /><br />But just like the DVD extras we see accompanying our favorite movies many years after they first hit the screen, there's a truth behind the illusion. And Peter breaks down a lot here, enough so to make us cringe -- from the oodles of sexual exploits to the mountain of drugs, to the bad business deals, to the callous behavior each showed toward one another.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading this, because like most rock autobiographies, we come to understand why rock stars have acted the way they have. Peter is no exception. It's tough for him to show humility given where he was and what he did, but somehow he does, more so than Ace Frehley did in his book. (I doubt that Paul Stanley will write an autobiography, thus telling all all four sides of the story, but I'll be among the first to read it if he does.)<br /><br />But despite all the behind-the-scenes nastiness as spelled out in this book, I still think of KISS as my favorite band, and I can escape from the troubles of my own life just by slipping on one of their records. And it makes me smile to read that when Peter went through a major health crisis in the last few years, his decision to speak out about it has since helped more men in a similar situation take control.<br /><br />KISS fans will like this, though they'll probably see the band -- and the brand -- in a different light because of it.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I did not think I would like this movie but it held my interest and was actually a cute story
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always fast paced action and surprising twists and turns.  Flynn is a master of the game and we find it believable!
B00065GX1O|4.0|I think this was meant to be a bit of a whim and an unusual production in the spirit of the summer festival celebrating Puccini in the place where he created his music. It takes the \\"Butterfly\\" theme literally and makes all the characters into insects except for Pinkerton who seems to be sort of a Marlon Brando biker. The sets are meant to be minimalist in the style of summer theater. Don't buy this if you don't own another more traditional version of MB because you will miss the classic presentation and realistic aspects of the story necessary for understanding and the way Puccini intended. Much is done with symbolism throughout and the final scene is very dramatic. There is a dream-weaver character that dances in pantomime and is part of the fanciful spirit of the production. The relationship between Pinkerton and Butterfly and their singing is tremendous. I think they are married. It also seems to be a tribute to Placido Domingo and shows him doing some rather dramatic directing. But the music is all beautiful Puccini as he wrote it.
B009H442DG|3.0|I love Travolta & Newton-John, but I was somewhat disappointed in this album. Olivia's voice is more raspy these days, and the arrangements weren't that great. I'll only play it once during the holidays.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Fun Christmas movie, perfect for everyone in the family, to teach what the Spirit of a child's magic Christmas is all about.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Pretty exciting, some funny moments.  It is good to see all the old fellas on screen again.  Excessively high body count.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this video! I have done level 1 and 2 and I love it, I think that level 1 is actually harder than 2. But this really does change your body if you eat right and do this every single day!
B006O3MU96|4.0|I haven't got the hang of jumping and tilting my fire smooth enough to get very far but its not the games fault if I stink.<br />With practice I look forward to more challenges of shooting snowballs through my nose at enemies. lol<br /><br />The graffics and characters are a simple pencil type drawing but is done well with a nice holiday theme and is colorful. I had my sound off so I cant rate music if any.  The original game is exactly the same and again I was not able to control my tilt smooth enough to ever get far in the game but its a cute game with a simple goal.<br />I haven't had my son test it yet ( 6 yr old)  but I'm sure he would manage it and enjoy the characters.<br />Florida Mom<br />Merry Christmas
0345803507|3.0|Per my review on the first book, I have to say I still fail to see how these books so quickly became a craze. The second started to become a fun read when the storyline got exciting, but then plunged right back into cheesy &#34;erotica&#34; writing. It was the same thing over and over, her breath &#34;hitching&#34; at his touch, his heavenly smell of &#34;christian and expensive body wash&#34; her &#34;oh please, I want you now&#34; blah, we get it! The scenes may have been spiced up by changes of props and scenery but overall, exactly the same thing. His need to control and her giving into it. The final book takes you for a bit of a ride but I felt Iike the ending was boring and predictable. For once I would like to see one of these series take a none fairy tale turn and end in a way the reader won't expect. But I guess those wouldn't sell as much then would they?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is just what I needed..I do mobile banking on my kindle fire and then use calculator to balance

B0083SBMBM|5.0|It's was great to see this movie come to life. Every part of it was amazing. Lots of action in every scene, highly recommend this action packed movie.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|sweet game! everything is awesome. except the fact that you only get 3 worlds and to get the fourth you either have to pay an extra 1.99 or get 3stars on every level(which is virtually impossible). otherwise its an awesome game! please Rovio! stop making us buy worlds! I'm fine with buying things to help on levels but worlds not so much.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love this trilogy, I was so happy to see it all on blu ray. It took half a day to watch all three movies but its worth it. One big tip have plenty of snack ready.lol love it!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|A WELL WRITTEN GOOD STORY OF THE PROBLEMS IN DEALING WITH THE AFGANS AND PAKISTANS.  IF YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER ANY MORE OF THESE YOU WILL TAKE THE NUMBER OF WORDS I FEEL LIKE GIVING YOU.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Way too much fighting/chases/explosions. It got so tiring! Poor acting too. I guess men would enjoy this more than I did.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This is a good movie for kids.  Entertaining and time well spent. I believe the family will enjoy the experience
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If u like war games this is a good on to get build your army and take down the KRA
1451695195|2.0|I did not enjoy this book and feel that Dr. Alexander needed assistance from a professional writer to bring this experience together.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|It was brand new as stated and received very quickly.  This is a great movie with lots of action and a great cast.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|This won't be a indepth review of plot/character/technicalities of the movie, others have already done a masterful job of that, this is just a summary of my reaction.  9th Gate isn't a horror movie, its a supernatural mystery and thus its pace must by necessity, be a bit slow.  However, its done in such a way that your curiosity is constantly engaged as you wonder what the puzzle is within the 3 books.  Depp does a wonderful job of portraying a person who gets drawn into the center of all this, finding himself at a unexpected conclusion.  This was time well spent in watching.
B0019BI1FA|4.0|Brand new as stated and received very quickly.  Have not watched all of them but the one's I did the quality was not very good.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Several other reviews have already gone into great depth of this movie's contents, this is just a summary of my personal opinion about the movie.  As the rating indicates, it was ok.  I'm not someone who expects each sequel to dial it up a notch, but Renner was not allowed to portray the same degree of deadliness that Damon was or the same degree of craftiness/awareness.  Still I watched it and got a modest enjoyment out of it.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|It was brand new as stated and received very quickly.  This is a great kids movie and is actually pretty funny.
B003VANOFY|4.0|R. Goan and Twoboxer both gave truly excellent reviews of this headset with great depth of information.  I can't say much to go beyond what they have already provided shoppers with.  What I can tell you is that I've owned a number of headsets over the years, where I didn't not skimp on quality by buying low priced ones.  This one beats them all hands down.  Occasionally the software is a little annoying, but the sound, comfort, and performance of this headset is hands down the best I've ever owned.  I love listening to music and movies with this thing despite having a high quality 5.1 speaker system hooked up to my pc rig, and when playing games, the immersion effect is greatly amplified with one hearing subtle sounds far more noticeably than before.  I dread the day my headset won't recharge and hope its successor builds on this one's success.<br /><br />Update: 4-2-2015  (knocked a star off rating for reasons listed under cons).<br /><br />Pros: Been using the G930 almost daily for 2-5 hours at a stretch, the battery only ran dry if I forgot to hook it up to recharge overnight.  After over 2 years of steady use, its only natural that the material lining the ear cups has frayed here and there, but the comfort level is the same as when I first got it, and the mic is still solidly attached and delivers clear sound. The battery still holds a solid 10 hours of charge time from full to empty, with a full recharge from empty taking around 3 hours (same as when I first got it).  The performance of the speakers and software is still immersive and good quality.<br /><br />Cons:  Drivers are Logitech's weak spot, if I installed a update it would be hit or miss if it would work right and I got into the habit of keeping a backups 3 layers deep to roll back to.  Tech support responds but rarely on their forums, often its other users who figure out solutions to issues (sadly a growing trend with several Logitech products).<br /><br />Plastic housing above the ear cups cracked after several months, requiring some Gorilla Glue to rejoin the crack and keep the headset functional despite being careful from the get-go when taking it off.  Its a complaint that pops up more than a few times on their boards particularly since there are no replacement parts one can get, so I'm reasonably sure it wasn't due to user handling.  (advice: remove headset GENTLY at all times).<br /><br />For the money its a very good wireless headset, but I've knocked off a star due to cons above.  Its still the best wireless headset I've owned, especially at this price range.  But when this headset fails, I'll give the competition a closer look.lla Glue to rejoin the crack and keep the headset functional despite being careful from the get-go when taking it off.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Others have written a much more in depth review than I have time for, but I thought this continued a tradition of excellence of the series which finally but the Dark Knight in the proper light (pardon the pun).  I was initially a bit skeptical of Hathaway's role as the Catwoman, but she pulled it off with flair and style that captured the essence of the character giving me a new respect for her skills as a actress.  While Bane was presented somewhat differently from the comics, his essence was still captured to where he, like Ledger's Joker, are almost iconic.  I also absolutely loved how the continuing legacy of the League of Shadows remains a presence to tie the 3 movies together, much like Sauron in LotR trilogy.  I initially purchased a 48 hr rental, I watched a 2nd time the next day as well as ordering the bluray for my collection if that's any indication of this movie's entertainment value.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|The game was brand new as stated and I received it very promptly.  An exciting sequel to the bourne trilogy.
B0071QIN00|1.0|I am not one to write reviews...however the design of this game is poor and needs to be cleaned up a lot.
1250006341|5.0|Brand new as stated and received very quickly.  Great book and very interesting.  I love the series and enjoyed getting in deeper into the characters.
B005HSL626|2.0|great game until it wouldn't open anymore.  I'd get it but it might stop working eventually. it only opens to the advertisements them closes.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|It was brand new as stated and received very quickly.  I love BBC and historical pieces.  This is a good one, especially for this price.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Excellent point and click adventure. No hidden object scenes and contains a map, hints and walkthrough if needed. Little slow to start...I had another game downloading in background so that may have been problem... but stick with it and great price for length and quality of game.  Very refreshing change from all of the hidden object games w/out much adventure.  This one is up there with some better quality producers.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|It was brand new as stated and received very quickly.  This is a must have if you are a Twilight fan.

B006IYG5HE|4.0|Every book brings some new elements to Harry's character, as doe this one.  I enjoyed learning more about some of the darker aspects of Norway's modern history as well as its pretty bright present.  Although one or two plot twists were a bit too predictable for me (and you also should try to read the series in order as best you can), Nesbo takes chances with the fate of his main characters unlike many authors.

B001VIMCW4|5.0|As a huge fan of the Bond franchise, the action just keep getting better and better. Of course, I can appreciate a Bond film where the protagonist does nothing more strenuous than sky dive or ski. In the latest of the Daniel Craig movies, they give new meaning to the word &#34;strenuous&#34;. The stunt men should definitely get paid double for some of these sequences! And while Bond might not quite &#34;get the girl&#34;, he is able to save her. And here is a man who definitely &#34;works out&#34;! The only question that remains is whether they continue to use the same tailor for those exquisite suits.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|THis is a fun game, but unfortunately you only get about 5-10 minutes of playtime before you run out of coins.  They obviously want you to buy more coins using real money, but do people really do that?  THey must.  But I do not.<br /><br />This is a fun diversion and is surprisingly addictive.  Maybe 10 minutes is just about right, as I couldn't see myself playing this for long stretches.
B002ZG994U|5.0|It was brand new as stated and received very quickly.  This is a great action movie and it has some funny dialogue.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Love Dexter.  This is a great story line!!  Will continue watching!! Michael C. Hall is great as Dexter Morgan!!  Had a little fuzziness with the streaming for a few minutes during this episode.
0062124293|5.0|I'm a guy who bought this as a gift for my college girlfriend, a self-declared strident feminist and comedian. I read it before giving to her.<br /><br />I was reading this around several conservative older people, who couldn't help looking at me funny as I guffawed and slapped my knees every othy page. It is a fresh and fun take on what it means to navigate the often ridiculous and overly-academic modern world. While she skimps on some serious issues, such as violence against women, and it is limited to the incorrectly-presumed-to-be-universal middle-class Western version of &#34;a woman,&#34; she makes the topic of Feminism both relevant and fun, and therefore accessible and easy to digest.<br /><br />I recommend it to anybody who likes laughing or isn't completely closed-minded.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This had funny lines through out, it is a humorful glee. If you like music and subtle one liners and some not so subtly this move is for you.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I use my iPhone to take a lot of simple video shots, and this is a great solution for it.<br /><br />You could easily use other similarly-sized smartphones (maybe not a Samsung Galaxy S3) with this little kit.<br /><br />The plastic feels cheap but it works and hey, you get what you pay for.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This was i thought going to be a little better than a Hangover 2 type re-telling of the same story, I mean it had a few different asspects but as a whole left me wanting for at least a Reboot of this franchise which i liked the other movies this they should have went do we need to make more money of a name, the answer should have been NO.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So many lessons on life and love !a beautiful,tragic story!! I want to 're - read this because there were so many life truths!
B008M721MS|3.0|The app works well but has no volume control. Is very difficult to hear contacts when conducting video or voice chat.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love Will Ferrell and this is my favorite of his performances. So cute! I love it and so do my young children!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Picture quality was not good at times.  Was disappointed, because it is not usually like that.<br />We liked the movie.
1468014269|4.0|I ordered this for my brother and he was very pleased. I recommend it for any historian. Priced very reasonably.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I was always trying to find a good hidden object game, and this one is great.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Scene number 18 is the best, followed by scene 9.  Watching thug boy do what he does best...drop it down low.  Fun and yummy :D
B005LAII3U|5.0|I'm really bummed that I missed this at the cinema. I should've caught it. Total Recall is a major sci-fi spectacle on a scale that needs a giant screen to be fully appreciated. The highly detailed special effects are phenomenal and seamless, creating a very believable future dystopia. The acting is great - Farrell pulled this off very well, lending an appropriate sense of gravitas to one whose reality was upended. Sexy Beckinsale and Biel are gorgeous and I love their elevator fight scene. The sophisticated plot only enhanced the killer action scenes.  Recall is in effect a chase flick with great twists. It's exciting and should be seen on the biggest screen you can find. Arnold had his day but this remake easily eclipses the original, easily fitting into the PKD milieu created by Minority Report and Blade Runner.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I enjoyed the characters along with story.  It was quite different and we enjoyed watching the movie.  I would recommend it to friends and family.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Tedious to get thru. Drags on forever. Don't put any effort into this book, it will take forever to finish.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary app is exactly what you want - it's fast and easy to use. Plus it's free! I highly recommend this app especially if you are reading books with difficult words
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I love playing on my android phone and thought with more space on my Kindle Fire, the game would be fantastic. Wrong. I can't even log in on my Fire. It always says that my password is invalid when I know damn well it's correct. Uninstalled.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I have to say this has some fantastic special effects, and the story is interesting.  Hats off to taking actual historical events and turning them for the movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Detective Harry Bosch gets the opportunity to investigate a twenty-year-old murder from the Rodney King L.A. riots.  He solves it by sheer perserverence.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Nathan Fillion is a funny, quick-witted actor. I really enjoy his large collection of cancelled shows. ;-) Castle is his first mainstream hit, and it is a good one. If you enjoy Nathan Fillion in Firefly, then you'll definitely like this show. If you love funny police dramas, sorta along the same lines as Monk or Psych maybe, then you might like this show. It is a bit more gritty than those examples though. If you have been enjoying Castle, but were unfamiliar with Nathan Fillion, I recommend a brief science-fiction show called Firefly. It has space cowboys -- literally.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Just when you think they could not top themselves, they bring in Leonard Nimoy to voice Sentinel Prime, Optimus' predecessor.  The CGI on this movie is so fantastic it feels real!  Michael Bay really has the feel for how they Transformers' need to act, and their interactions with the Human Race.  Hugo Weaving is perfect as Megatron in all 3 movies as well.  And it was nice to hear Peter Cullen return from the G1 series as the voice of Optimus.
B00005JSGK|4.0|My grandson loves animals, and this is a good family movie with lots of African animals in it.  We watched it after opening our Christmas, and the entire family enjoyed it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I thought the book was very interesting and I thing it needed four stars because some parts didn't make sence
6305754969|5.0|This was a purchase for me.  I am a John Wayne fan, and this one is one of my favorite.  I've seen this one many times, but I wanted a copy for my files since most things on TV these days is not worth watching.  This is.
0525953728|2.0|The author or should I say authors have painted a picture nessessary to appease the American public<br />with more smoke and mirrors.<br />Here we a told is a guy and his crew who are trained to machine level in there skill set, which is the efficient killing of people.<br />First Debating where to shoot UBL and then stating if he is unarmed and no threat bring him in, but then to shoot him in the face unarmed and half naked in front of his wives.  What a joke.  There is no honor in what these men do.  They are cold blooded killing machines used a \\"tools\\" by our government to remove anyone in there way.<br />If we took all the money used to create these monsters and cured child hood cancer would not that be a much better thing.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was funny, heart-wrenching at times, but heart-warning overall. It is a great story full of hope and hardship. I enjoyed every moment of it. Reading from a dog's perspective was fun and different. Now I look at my own dog and see her \\"humanness\\" so much more.
0679809015|5.0|I bought this for my grandson who had just turned 1 year old.  He loves the book.  Yes, it's hard for him to lift the flaps, but if you lift them just a tiny bit for the child, they can do the rest.  I'm buying another copy as his was in a water spill. The inside is fine but the outside may not last much longer!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I am a huge Family Guy fan, so I was expecting to love this. It was funny but just not as funny as I'd expect from Seth. It is definitely worth renting but don't buy it.<br />I renew this from amazon for only $3.99 sure beats driving to a movie store.
B001HN690O|5.0|How many times have we all seen sequels that pale in comparison to the original; too many times to count for sure.  Thankfully, this is NOT one of those times!  This is a fantastic movie, and good as the original was, this one is even better.  If you can believe it, somehow they managed to make it more exciting, more action packed, and yet, sweeter and more sentimental and touching too.  The bonus features are a hoot.  Lots of fun stuff to look at.  It's just a shame this movie didn't do better in theaters.  We don't recall what it opened against, but recall that this never hit #1.  It's a shame, since maybe it didn't get the audience it deserves.  But here's your chance to catch this new classic at home.  It's really a good one!  Hope they make a third one.  Could watch this on again and again.  Stunning visuals and animation too.  Really top-shelf.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Simple start and use with a few options to keep it interesting.  Pop up ads are annoying and detract from playing.
0062082353|5.0|I bought this book for my (24 year old) son, who loves to read about military history.  This book was was 5 star for him as well as my daughter.  My husband plans to read it next and I am sure it will hold him captive as well.
B006YW6KX4|5.0|Fast paced and romantic movie. Absolutely stunning cinematography. William Holden is a perfect fit for the role! Kim Novak cannot be any lovelier. Great Blu-ray color restoration, not 3D feel yet but close.
B009POCFTG|5.0|Chris has a problem: he's into some bad people for some big money.  When he discovers his mother has a large life insurance policy in her name, he schemes with his deadbeat father and his stepmom to kill his mother.  To do this, he turns to Joe Cooper.  Joe's a police detective with an unusual side job: he's a contract killer.  Joe only has two rules: if you get caught, you never heard of him; and you always pay up front.  When Chris confesses a problem with the latter, Joe quickly finds a solution, taking Chris's child-like sister Dottie as a retainer.<br /><br />KILLER JOE is dark.  It is very dark.  Nor is this apparent from the get-go; it slowly builds atmosphere, spiraling upward into a roaring crescendo of an ending.  The film is anchored by the central performance from Matthew McConnaughey, who nails every line, every stare, every step he takes.  McConnaughey plays off of his trademark charm; Joe is a nice guy...until he lets the act slip for a heartbeat, and you see the psychopath underneath.  McConnaughey's performance is so strong and forceful, you have to take a step back and realize that he's not the only actor in the movie.  In fact, the entire central cast is surprisingly good.  Emile Hirsch, as Chris, embues an otherwise despicable character with a sense of conscience.  Thomas Hayden Church provides much of the levity here; and yet, there's something unnerving about his performance, as though he's only a step or two away from becoming as crazy as Joe.  Gina Gershon's performance is haunting and hilarious; the same goes for Juno Temple, as the innocent Dottie.  Dottie threatens to be the least interesting character here; yet, thanks to Temple, Dottie comes across as a fully fleshed-out young woman.  Her and McConnaughey's scenes, despite their rather blandness compared to some of the film's extremes, are among the hardest to watch.<br /><br />KILLER JOE is not a film for the squeamish.  It was filmed as NC-17, and it doesn't shy away from it.  There's nudity and there's violence, all of it hard to watch.  Tracy Letts' pitch-perfect screenplay (based on his own stage play) not only embraces its white-trash underpinnings, it dives in face-first.  And yet, the film is actually a comedy--a dark comedy, to be certain, so dark that some of the humor isn't immediately apparent (McConnaughey, in the bonus features, admits to not \\"getting\\" it on his first read).  One moment you're laughing; the next, you're trying not to wince.  Throughout it all, your attention is riveted to the screen.  KILLER JOE isn't for everyone, but if you can tough it out, it's a truly great film.nudity and there's violence, all of it hard to watch.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover books are the first books I have read in my life. I am now at the age of 31 years old , and I have never in my life had the desire to read a book, not even in high school. I always found some way around it. But my 12 year old son wanted a kindle for Christmas in 2011, So I found the money to buy him a 2 gen. Kindle keypad it was inexpensive on eBay so I bought it. But the funny thing is he never one asked to buy books for it. How funny is that.  So I have absolutely no idea what snapped in me, but one night I wanted to read to see if I could actually do it. I read craft books all the time, but that's something that tells me how to do something with me hands and mind. I never thought I could actually read a chapter book. So I asked him if I could buy a book on there and see if I could read it. He said yes that night and I have never put the kindle down one day since literally. And that was August 6, 2012 I read Slammed by Colleen Hoover and on August 7, 2012 I read point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover. I will say I have read over 100 books since that day and today is Dec.24,2012 and I just finished. Hopeless  I do not think anyone can compete with her. The more books she writes the better they get. I can't wait for the next Slammed book to come out. Has far has Hopeless the book is Epic. Please read the her books.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|I didn't really enjoy the novels in this series by Philippa Gregory. This one is OK, better than the White Queen.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I used to watch the cartoon show as a kid. I felt they really maintained the dynamics of the original show. Loved the story and the humor. Classic fun.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fantastic read! Found myself not able to put it down! Great characters, great story. You will be very entertained while reading. Does not disappoimt!
B000002HNR|5.0|A compilation of several Doors concerts. It provides a different sound than the usual studio-produced recordings. Would definitely recommend this CD
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Again, good product.<br />As advertised.<br />Excellent pricing.<br />Would definitly purchase again.<br />Eazy to select proper replacement for my Sony camera
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie... stemming from the fact that I used to live in Los Angeles and it would play on KTLA every Christmas seasons since I could remember. So I upgraded to a digital copy. But, no Christmas season is complete without surly nuns singing about a rebellious prospect before and DURING her wedding (as she is walking down the aisle, no less) or seeing a bunch of mischievous kids become beautiful angels through song!<br />So rich... so very, very amazing.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|This is not for children, there is a lot of adult humor in this movie. I wouldn't watch it again.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Beautifully magical.  Reminds me of the true meaning of family at Christmas time with a romantic flair.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Wasnt as good as the first movie. Alittle overdone and heath ledger was a better villain. Sequels never seem to raise the bar or even meet it.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I am so very happy tp have purchased this DVD because it is really very beautiful and Michael, as always is awesome !!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the way it is laid out. It is fun for every age. But some parents not may enjoy the machine gun pack. and other violent sequences :o)
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game! get any g5 games if u love a tycoon! I'm going to play this forever!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|HUNGER + GAMES = SO FREAKING AWESOME!!!<br />LITERALLY, BEST SERIES EVER!!!<br />LOVE THIS! I RECOMMEND TO EVERY PERSON ON THE PLANET!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Its a great book to read, i finished it in 3 days! couldn't put it down, I highly recommend it!
B000FC1RCI|4.0|This was a required reading for my son. He enjoyed it and said it was the best book they ever required them to read. He said it was a good murder mystery.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|My wife and I wanted to watch a light-hearted movie about marriage and this was not it for us.  Most of the movie was spent focusing on a severely dysfunctional marriage and a couple's attempt to repair it.  Only in the last 15 minutes or so do you get to the feel good part.  I think that the movie was a serious drama and that it raised some  issues about problems that can arise in marriages.  The image / poster for the movie gives the impression that it is more of a comedy and that I why I was disappointed.
B007HACDLK|1.0|Can't read it!  Amazon won't send it to be although I brought it.  Why?  I would love to read it. SUCKS. Charlie
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This movie is such a blast! Great fight choreography and surprisingly good cinematography too. This movie was well packaged and shipped quickly, and even though the dubbing is a bit shaky, it's still a very fun movie.
B000VE439Y|5.0|I was first introduced to this movie when a Latin professor of mine showed the class the \\"Romans go home\\" scene. I just finally got around to watching the whole movie, and absolutely loved it. I was laughing out loud watching this. There are plenty of reviews on here singing the movie's praises so I'll give you my two criticisms. The first being the spaceship part. I didn't find it funny and it took away from the plot for me. I wanted it to stick to just satirizing ancient Rome. My second complaint is the nudity. I have no problem with nudity when it is adding aesthetic value (think Titanic). But of course, many people won't have a problem with either of these criticisms.<br />Besides the above, I found all of the comedy extremely tasteful. Of course, it was somehow at the same time childish but in the best way possible. Contrary to how a few other viewers have felt on here, I did not think the movie was trying to be critical or undermine Christianity. I've noticed there is a tendency for many Christians to be completely okay with satirizing other religions like Hinduism, Islam, and Mormon in literature but forbid anyone touches Christianity. It's just so common most people don't really think about how ingrained the satirizing of religions besides Christianity is. This movie is not a personal attack against Christianity. It is a fun movie on, yes religion, but also Roman customs, bureaucracy, and gender roles, If you can see the humor is not malicious or personal, you'll enjoy it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Rude, crude, and utterly hilarious at times.  Give Seth credit for creating something original.  I don't know what was funnier:  watching a stuffed Teddy bear drive a car while high or listening to Marky Mark speak in his native tongue.  You will find yourself guffawing at some of the jokes.  Goofy, twisted and fun.....if you like that sort of thing ;)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener is excellent it will Handel almost any blade but is small enough to carry in your pocket.<br />Great Gift for any occasion
0316223239|1.0|I bought my copy of Room as an e-book. I'm at 38% and I just can't do it anymore. This book is incredibly tedious. It is not just the five-year-old language but also the pace of the plot development. At 3% I had a pretty good idea of what was going on and yet, here I am at 38% with minimal movement in the storyline. I have considered this tediousness may be intentional on the part of the author. That is, trying to impress on the reader the essence of being trapped in Room. If that is the case, she nailed it; however, I can thankfully escape Room any time I want and now is that time.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|Love Philip's voice.  He puts his heart and soul into his music and makes it meaningful.  Looking forward to his music for years to come.
B00AJMTZ50|5.0|You cannot go wrong with 27 tunes by Clapton.  At 55¢ a track, a steal.<br /><br />He used to be God, now he is a genius.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The facts surrounding this &#34;visit to heaven&#34; are irrefutable.  Medical science remains amazed but yet as always science related fields still find it hard to believe the truth. I appreciate Eben Alexander III for sharing his story.
B003QF8E4A|4.0|Suspenseful with a twist at the end. Not suitable for young children due to intense imagery. Historical inaccuracies in the depiction of the liberation of Dachau.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Sexy and fun.  I would recommend both seasons on DVD. I watched them when they first came to the SyFy channel from Canada and still got the DVDs after that. SyFy is having a season 3. Now is a good time to catch up. More in my review for season 2.
B004OZZ624|1.0|ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ SNOOZER, TOO SLOW PACED...IT PUT ME TO SLEEP. WHERE WAS THE ACTION???? I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE AN INSOMNIAC
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was very well though out. Lots of devious planning! A shawshank redemption for the guilty!  You will be up until 1:00 am reading it every night - you will have to know what happens!!!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|While this movie had action and was entertaining there wasn't the same feeling of unknown on what would happen next. The very end had some surprises, but I have the opinion that the first two of this series were better films overall.
B009NOVCU6|4.0|I love the Rolling Stones & to have all their hits in 1 box set is wonderful. The only drawback if you can call it that is this album's version of &#34;You Can't Always Get What You Want,&#34; isn't the version I'm use to. It doesn't include the choir at the beginning.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My son wanted this DVD because he enjoyed watching the first Diary of A Wimpy Kid. My son ejoyed it & watched it 3 times in a row.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|No problems with the disc, I like that. Put it in and it plays beautifully. A great buy. Thank you
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I did read several of his books .and the Racketeer is just as good .You want to keep reading very hard to put it down,looking forward to the next one Ilove.d it  Wilhelmina
B009VB7P6G|4.0|The Secret of the Wings was very age appropriate. I enjoyed it with my granddaughter. I would recommend it to all.
0547884591|5.0|After reading this for a few hours I can already tell that it's going to be one of the most useful gifts I've ever received. (I drastically improved my reading speed after completing a tiny little exercise that Tim casually throws in on page 77, and I am now convinced that Tim's approach will work for any task.) Cooking and Spanish will no longer be difficult and painful things I force myself to learn. Now, they are going to be fun. I'm going to learn so many cool and useful things in the next year of my life, and it's going to be a ton of fun, and it's all going to be because of this book (and the people I share it with). Thank you, Tim, for causing my quality of life and learning to skyrocket.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's a challenge because you have to find the way to green to green. And from yellow to yellow and there are more Colors coming
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Of course, all the Angry Birds games are similar.  This was fun and I am still playing.  However, I can't figure out how to get back to early screens -- my grandson played it for a while and now it is advanced beyond my comfort zone!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is very important music.  This is a very spiritual album for Americans.  &#34;We Take Care of Our Own&#34; is the new National Anthem!
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I'm not sure what I expected, but this seemed cluttered and difficult.  I lost interest rapidly, perhaps my fault more than anything else.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This is a awesome movie, I liked it allot. The action was good,the guns and story were really good. You have to see it and see what you think.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really didn't spend enough time with this to be fair to it.  It seems awkward to place and build items and I lost interest.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|it gets old after a while and another thing this is just temple run with a few add ons but yeah I don't care what others say about my comment because this is my opinion.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is an action filled game, requiring a lot of quick thinking and responding.  It doesn't make much logical sense, but works well.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book reads fast but in a good way. It rarely slows and when it does it quickly picks up again. The ideas are imaginative and sometimes haunting.  nuff said.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game soooo much. my niece and I play this everyday all day its incredible. if I could
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great read...each time I started reading, I did not want to stop.  As you are reading you know something terribly wrong happened to Charlie, but can't put your finger on it.  Hits you in the gut when full story is told.  Very well written!!!
0374214913|5.0|Best book I've read this year. What's not to love - Google, cryptography, centuries old secret societies, the secret to immortality, and the love of old books. Loads of humor with a breezy writing style, but nevertheless the book contains some weighty ideas. READ THIS BOOK.
B002NXSRVG|3.0|wasnt what i was hoping for in terms of a GI Joe movie, hopfully the second one is better than the first
B002W7J3SO|5.0|A wonderful classic that kept my two teenaged daughters glued to the screen.  Don't miss it. Probably Eva Marie Saint's best role.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|this is a great dvd series that is on par with Band of Brothers. very motiviating. very accurate. all in all a must see movie for EVERYONE. war buff or pacifisit. everyone needs to see this and band of brothers so all American's understand how the men and women of our armed services go through to protect our rights and interests.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Did anyone else think this book started off fan-freaking-tastic and then kind of lost it's luster halfway through? I'm probably in the minority when I say this but that's how I felt.<br /><br />This book started off so strong for me - I was literally smiling to myself like the nerdy girl reader that I am. And with lines like this, how could you not be amused?<br /><br />&#34;If there's one thing I can't stand, it's crying. Not because it makes me emotional, but because it annoys the hell out of me. And it's awkward.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I seriously thought people only acted this way in books, but I'm witnessing first hand that idiots actually exist.&#34;<br /><br />Seriously, this was the most amused I've been while reading a book in a while and I read...a lot.<br /><br />Then at about the halfway point, the book got real real fast.<br /><br />There was a somewhat unexpected twist and things started to get really emotional. Part of the reason why I loved the book at the beginning was because of Sky's snarkiness and her I-don't-give-a-crap attitude. Once we reach the pivotal point, snarky Sky goes away and we're left with an emotional Sky. I get it - Sky has some major issues to deal with. And I think Colleen did a fantastic job in portraying this. All the emotions came across on the page - it didn't feel forced or contrived. But I'm not going to lie, the reason I picked up the book was because of the pre-Holder version of Sky. I liked that she was stand-offish to guys and had an attitude. I do realize that this version of Sky wasn't exactly healthy mentally/emotionally but I still liked her nonetheless.<br /><br />That aside, I flew through this book and am happy that Sky and Holder got their HEA.<br /><br />Also, there were some awesome secondary characters in this book. Six and Breckin were both kick butt - I'd love to have them as my very best friends ever in the whole wide world.<br /><br />Some of my favorite Six quotes:<br />&#34;I'm not even out the door yetand you've already replaced me? Vicious. And for the record, I don't have an inability to say no to guys. I have an inability to grasp the moral ramifications of premarital sex. Lots and lots of premarital sex.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Lust is the best of all the deadly sins.&#34;<br /><br />Some of my favorite Breckin quotes:<br />&#34;I'm not even going to tell you what I think about what just happened in there. But I know it sucked and I have no idea why you aren't crying right now, but I know your heart hurts, and maybe even your pride. So f*** school. We're going for ice cream.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Open the damn present, Sky. I know you hate getting gifts, but I love giving them, so stop being a depressing b*tch and open it and love it and hug me and thank me.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I'm Breckin,&#34; he says. &#34;I'm in an alliance to overtake the public school system and all its minions with your daughter.&#34;<br /><br />If Colleen decided to write a book about Six or Breckin, I would snap it up in a heartbeat. They are definitely one of the main reasons why I liked this book so much.<br /><br />All in all, I did enjoy this book - the first half seriously kicked butt and while it didn't grab me as much toward the end, I still couldn't wait to finish it.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|its so nice to have the entire original series movie collection in one beautiful package. its a must have for any star trek fan.

B0090RSYVG|5.0|bought this as a gift for a friend. its sturdy, well kept together, and works well on anything you hang it on.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I chose my rating based on the sometimes factual information that Clancy adds to his novels. I love the way he writes and the type of books he puts out. This is just another of his novels that is a very good adaptation to real life.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|a fun ride. great movie. awesome cars. if you like fast cars, explosions, guns, and hot chicks. see this movie!
B005LAIH54|3.0|Thought it would have more action but it's still an ok movie i would recommend it to watch. Maybe there will be another one.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|a fun thrill ride of action adventure and explosions. if you are looking for a fun movie to enjoy with all of the big name actors you know and love, this is the movie for you!

B006O6F932|5.0|She was very excited to get a playset to go with her Monster High Dolls. I believe it folds up for storage.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey...the cast, the script and plot line, the setting, scenery...all exceeds any expectations.  I purchased this series, because I could never quite catch it on PBS.  I knew that it was a series worth watching. I am now caught up for Season 3.  The character development and the social etiquette for the era really makes one think and it all comes to life. I highly recommend this to anyone who is breathing and upright.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|This is a very consistent album with its own sound that breaks all conventions and makes it difficult to classify.  This album has a continuous driving orchestral rock beat along with an extremely talented female lead singer.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Following Anita Moorjani's NDE is truly inspirational.  Beautifully written and easily understood, this book speaks to many of different faiths, beliefs and cultures.  It gets a person to think about one's own spirituality and one's own life....and to see how we are all tied together at the same time.  Exceptional!!
B006O3MU96|4.0|The game itself was actually very nice. The graphics were very good and I couldn't see a problem. But Id also like to point out that it is exactly the same as the original Christmas. If you already have original don't spend an extra dollar on this. I got it for free app of the day.
1451695195|5.0|An interesting description of one of the most fascinating aspects of life.<br />Highly recommended to those seeking answers to the meaning of life.
B003VANOFY|1.0|There appear to be issues with this device that show up over time.  Don't trust any review that doesn't take this into account.  I've had to modify my original review of this product due to issues that have shown up.  I've included my original review at the bottom.<br /><br />The problems I'm having now are with the USB adapter constantly restarting.  Every 10 to 15 minutes the USB adapter will cycle.  The green light connection indicator first blinks, accompanied by an audible buzz/beep, then the light shuts off - accompanied by dead silence.  This persists for about 3 seconds.  Then the light turns on and sound resume normally.<br /><br />There is another owner who experienced this issue here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZTUGK74HKSC/ref=cm_cr_quotes_dprb_2?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VANOFY&nodeID=172282&store=electronics<br /><br />You can imagine that this gets incredibly irritating very quickly.  I prefer not to wear headphones at all now.<br /><br />I've opened a support ticket with Logitech.  Hopefully this issue can be resolved.  If not, there's no way I would ever recommend these headphones to anyone.<br /><br />[Update]<br />I've opened a support ticket with Logitech, and their solution to this problem seems to be moving the receiver as far away from any wireless routers as possible.  Since my routers are in the same room as my gaming rig and headphones; this isn't much of a solution.  That said, docking the receiver into the dock has improved the drop rate to more than once per hour from once every ten minutes.<br /><br />Still, for a >$100 pair of headphones, you expect the wireless functionality to work properly, not to \\"mostly work.\\"<br /><br />I strongly do **not** recommend these headphones for their wireless capability due to the issues I've encountered here.  I will investigate using them wired and see if they continue to drop.<br /><br />More reviews that mention these same problems:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J507Q3IP66IT/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VANOFY&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WA6RP6XZ2DAL/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VANOFY&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R14UKZQTKZ11H4/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VANOFY&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br /><br />And I have to confirm that yes, turning them on and off is annoying due to the nature of the power button.<br /><br />[Update #2 - March 21, 2013]<br />Logitech sent me a new headset, admitting that the functionality of my original pair seemed compromised.<br />Unfortunately, this new pair is suffering from the same issue.  I've used the headset for 15 minutes and they've restarted once already.<br /><br />I simply cannot recommend this headset to anyone.<br /><br />[Original Review]<br />I've had some cheap wireless headphones before, so I was worried about purchasing these at a much higher price.  I wound up getting them for $70 USD before shipping, which is an absolute steal.  The sound reproduction is superb and these suffer from no interference.  When you reach the limit  of their range, they simply cut out.  No static, no interference, pure bliss.<br />Some coworkers said the bass is a little light, but that kind of analysis boils down to personal preference to some extent.<br /><br />I had previously purchased some Altec Lansing inMotion IM616 Headphones, and there is no comparison between the two.  Obviously they are different markets and the headsets have different purposes, but the G930s are phenomenal in comparison.
B001P9KR94|3.0|An interesting and at times near comic view  and at times very sad view of the extreme poverty of an eastern nation on the rise.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|like the tv show very entertaining and great plot.  once I began reading I could not put down.  great purchase
B0034G4P80|5.0|All the Marvel movies I've seen lately have really impressed me, but Thor definitely stands out among them. It's the perfect mix of myth and modern. I'm not a big comic book reader so I can't tell you whether or not it stays true to the comics, but I can tell you it's a great action film. The plot is exciting and the acting is great! There's humor and romance tied into the story line, so even people who don't normally go in for action films can enjoy it. It's well written, with a lot of quotable moments. The villain keeps you on your toes, and his motives are definitely believable. I made my family sit down and watch it with me, and they all loved it too. Definitely a movie worth adding to your collection!
B0060FXDCG|5.0|If you love the Transformers movies then you must get this box set.  We can't wait for 4 to come out in 2014!!!
B009ZE27US|2.0|Is just not accurate, there's really not much to explain. Not even close, it is just giving out random ages. I tried it multiple times, all fingers, my son but same thing. Spit polish the screen and nothing.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|the app doesn't seem to have all the capabilities as working on your laptop but still good to have--you just can't write reviews--as far as I can see
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is great because you start with a blank screen and add the pieces to create the puzzle. lots of fun!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Part of it quit working after some use. I would not acquire this again. A big disappointment! This happened after about a week of  use
B00171EO0I|1.0|The worst contrivance I've seen in awhile. Ordinarily, I get a lump in my throat during commercials. There was no surprise here, to me.  Not a tear was shed.  I almost wish I had bought the physical copy so I could throw it out.<br /><br />I swear I'm not heartless. I just thought this was really bad.

B00AH34AUQ|2.0|¡UNO! and ¡DOS! were much better. ¡TRE! just didn't kick ass. I figured they'd lose steam along the way but after hearing how good the first two were, my expectations were high that they'd finish with a bang. Instead, it fizzled.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I gave it a 4 star rating because its good quality and does what it promises.<br />The reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the speakers pretty much suck ur better off bringing computer speakers with you when u travel and dont want to wear head phones.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|VERY exciting season.  Am half way through and will sit and watch the rest on 1 or 2 nights.  We see a different side of Don, an overweight Betty (I loved this) and get to watch the social revolution of the late 60s evolve - with all the social issues involved.  LOVE IT!
B006ZS4G24|5.0|this is a very well made product! my kid almost has everyone and plays with it all day!!! this is great for age 8 and above!
B00A77II0U|5.0|lots of fun! definitely worth it. very entertaining and totally sucks you in! not too long or too short. overall a good game. just wish it had a better ending
B004SIP69U|5.0|it is a great movie, not like the Academy Awards in 2002. masterful performances. recommended to all lovers of musical theater
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love that Evernote is almost everywhere...just need a solid Linux client. This version for the Kindle Fire is what you would expect...solid, but not quite as snappy as I would like. Overall ojebof the best notes apps out there.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|really is an interesting movie, but not really filled all my expectations. nevertheless enjoy this film. and I recommend it to young
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I'm a fan.  I'm not home when the show airs so I get it through Amazon when I have time to watch.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|really i like it. I look forward to the premiere of the new musical version.I recommend it to fans of musical theater
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book! I really got into the characters and felt what they felt. I was happily surprised by this story. Ready to start book two.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|A riveting story, exceedingly well written, intertwining the lives of two generations. I will certainly look at Boyd's other books.
0739352989|5.0|I rented the audio books from the library and just purchased the entire set as a Christmas present to myself...Loved the story so much...Bottom line it's a good old fashioned love story.<br /><br />I want to read more about this couple and I hope one day she gives writes more about Christian's views.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Very disappointed.  Story does follow the horse - saddest moment when the companion horse dies from maltreatment.  Nice 'horse story'.  Hppily everafter ending was trite, but at least everyone of the principles lived!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book is wonderful,especially for dog lovers! It makes you think a little bit differently about man's best friend. Beautiful.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|Disappointed, nice &#34;horse story&#34;  The horse was worthy of a more important movie.  Rather 'ho hum'.  Bland characters, not enough story about the training, running, and outcome of the animals life.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great app. Skifta wouldn't always recognize my content. But ES file explorer would always work . OK would highly recommend it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is hands down one of the most amazing HBO series ever. Right behind the Sopranos. It is very gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The package is beautiful and a true collectors item.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Plot & seen semms slow but I kinda understand where they are going with introducing a new character. Let's face it Matt Damon was born to play this role. All in all nice attempt but...
B004F1F32A|5.0|nuff said it is a good movie and it keeps my attention.  If you like action flix this is a good one
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen you have outdone yourself with Hopeless.  Amazing read. I couldn't put it down.  Sky is a special character that had me hooked from the very start.  And Holder, what can I say he is just dreamy..
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie, I have never read the book but the cinematography is amazing and the dialogue is done in a way that is understandable
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|We have wanted go watch this for awhile now. It was just ok and nothing that I would have to watch again or buy the Dvd to have at home.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Anyone who has seen Mad Men and thought this is good but seems slow should give this a try, wonderfully developed characters, a compelling and twisting story line and best of all tons of action. It can be very graphic and occasionally violent but still worth a look.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I love JK Rowling. Harry Potter is by far my favorite series I've ever read. I was excited to read this. But I haven't finished it and don't know if I will. It has too many characters and is pretty depressing.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Can't say I loved this movie the first time I watched it but by time you see the end you realize just how brilliant it is. And Robert Downey is just fantastic.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I didn't see the whole movie, someone recomended to my husband, but I didn't like it due to the bad words; also I didn't see nothing fun.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This is almost exactly the way I envisioned it as I was reading the novel. Just as creepy and gritty.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|This is one of my favorite, actually probably my favorite zombie/apocalyptic flick. I really hope they make a sequel. And I like the alternate ending featured here instead of the theatrical ending.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wonderfully paced! I read the first two and would constantly get bored at slow parts or be frustrated because the action would go beyond what I had time to sit and read. But this book was beautiful in its pacing, kept the story going with tons of action, intrigue, politics, twists, deaths, and so on! Hard to say that anyone should forego the first two in the series but this one makes the work leading up to them quite worth it.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|LOVED this movie.  I thought it might be a &#34;guy movie&#34; but it has something in it for everyone.  I would even watch it again!  Drama, suspence and romance.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I am so sorry to have \\"upgraded\\" to Fire HD. Ads on lock screen. crappy keyboard, (compared to the fire) and now my eprint is not able to work. BTW..the weather bug won't work on this \\"improved\\" (I wish) version either. Amazon..u have finally disappointed me.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|It's a fun movie with weird looking aliens. The aliens are what make this movie memorable, their behavior and reactions.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This is a book that would make a great movie.  A real page burner. I could not put it down.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Individual characters are very funny,  but the back story is disjointed and unbelievable.  If you like spoofs of other movies or topics,  this is worth watching.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love the story. Follows on well from the first book. The characters are well thought out. Can't wait for the next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun!!!! I put this game on my kindle for my niece to play and I ended up loving it!!!!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I absolutely loved this film and the music all performed by Hawaiian artist is a perfect companion to it .
B008458O3S|3.0|I enjoyedlaying this game. But as it goes along, it gets confusing. A better HELP section would have been a great idea
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It helps a lot especially for a student like me, on my kindle fire it works very well. It is worth reading it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As good or better than all the other Ryan books. Junior is as exciting to read about as his father.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Often I watch a good movie and wonder just how much better the book must be. In the instance of this perfectly completed film I will not rush to read the Jane Austin classic. The movie has left me completed contented. A Masterpiece!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play this game more frequently than other games, enjoying a fun challenge. BUT, it's extremely annoying to have the cards jump around or to an empty spot of their own accord. A card will fill an empty space - a move I do not want! Can this be &quot;fixed&quot;?
B008MIMWOO|5.0|If you are an Austin Powers fan there is hours of enjoyment here.3 Blu Ray movies at a fantastic price.A must have for any DVD collector.
B000067IZ3|5.0|This movie was requested as a Christmas gift for a dear friend. I did not watch the movie, however it arrived on time and in great condition! Thank you!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another Grisham success.  He is a fantastic author and story teller.  All of his books are terrific.  Rates among his best.
034580404X|5.0|This movie was requested as a Christmas gift for a dear friend. I did not read the book, however it arrived on time and in great condition! Thank you!
B0095R76EW|1.0|I was so looking forward to this movie because I love these actors...but, it was long and boring! It wasn't funny or a drama...it was awkward and weird. Disappointed...
B00008EYA5|5.0|This movie was requested as a Christmas gift for a dear friend. I did not watch the movie, however it arrived on time and in great condition! Thank you!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Seriously tons and tons of fun. Highly addictive and the animation style is really cute. Farmville model ducks but still enjoyable.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a good source for weather watchers.  The weather channel is very reliable for its forecasts.  I use it on all my devices.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Don't waste your money. No plot, just lots of pointless violence. Like watching a video game, but without the satisfaction of playing yourself. They need to wrap up the Resident Evil series, its no longer entertaining.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|it was worth buying and also bought a lot of memories, thanks for putting a smile on my face!!!! thanks again
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was wishing for a more understandable ending.  I was left hanging and  not really sure what the ending of the story would be.
B00005R5G9|5.0|watched it a long time ago and i finally bought it!!! it's worth buying !! it's better then the second one
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this installed on my Kindle Fire and like it better then on my PC.  It is great for using in the kitchen when I am making one of the recipes that I have pinned
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Have used it yet but it will be great. I am sure it will be used when I have to go away from home,
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Fun movie to watch !!! had me toe tapping the whole time it was on !I would watch again and I am ...
B0089XH38M|4.0|I have not used this that much since I only got it a few days ago but it seems to be working to my satisfaction AVG has a good reputation and a good product.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|To be honest I already thought it would be interesting when I saw the trailer for this movie. I was just iffy on the comedy part. It was appropriately awkward in the beginning, especially with all the barf humor, but not too painful to watch. By the middle, I found myself leaning into the screen. Towards the end, I was as nervous as they were and was cheering for them as they performed. I found myself liking it so much that I went back a couple times to the parts that I liked best the first time.<br /><br />Even though she wasn't the main character, Fat Amy totally stole the show with her \\"what?!\\" and over-the-top moments. Beca seemed to be a leader from the start, so much so that it was a little too good to be true. I kind of felt bad for Aubrey, since she seemed to puke at least 10% her weight each time. Oh, and Jesse? I felt that he was a little too creepy and stalker-ish to be the main love interest. He's cute and all, but constantly following the girl and being everywhere she is IS creepy.<br /><br />Yeah, it does feel a little like Glee, and I don't like Glee, but there's something different in it that makes me like it better. The music was good. It was funny and entertaining. I'm sure I'd want to watch it again.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|We don't necessarily thing that the perpetual struggle of humanity is between our cingulate gyrus and the frontal lobes, but that's what it is.  Do not read this book at your peril.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I was just nodding I don't got it but it sounds like its great if it was free for just one day I would be just right
B000SZK41M|5.0|After all these years, I rewatched Die Hard with my teenage kids, and it still holds up.  Not only did my wife and I feel it was as good as when we first saw it, my kids, really enjoyed it as well.  Considering they have spent the last 8 years of their teenage lives inundated with everything from Lord of the Rings to Transformers, for them to think this is a legit action movie is really saying something.  Bruce Willis will always be one of the great action stars of all time.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I always knew about Alicia Keys but I'd never really been into her music. That has changed. This album is great. She takes us along with her on her personal journey all the way from the melancholy &#34;Adagio&#34; at the beginning to the joyful &#34;Hallelujah&#34; at the end. A couple of the songs are over-produced but Buy This CD, all I can say.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Did not know what to expect as brought for a business trip flight, thought I was getting something mindless to kill the time. A true page turner, could not put down till the end, thoroughly enjoyed.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book, but maybe not everyone would.  It basically chronicles the survival efforts of a guy stranded on Mars and goes into great detail about how he was able to convert whatever resources were available to him to accomplish that goal.  Mostly first-person narrative, and I found my self chuckling many times at the main characters wit and easy ability to find a positive in a very negative situation.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A delightful read.  This book combines a love of books and the modern culture of computers and the dominating presence of Google.  Can't wait for his next book.
1451688091|5.0|With an unassuming style that carries us along light a gentle river, Goodwin inducts us into the challenges Lincoln faced and the wisdom with which he overcame them and shaped our nation's history.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best TV series in a long time! Excellent script, set design, costumes and acting.  Doesn't get any better than this.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Love this series, it kept my interest and kept me entertained. &#34;The Mark Of Athena&#34; is what I expected and more.
B005HSL626|5.0|simple but very entertaining. I . wasn't expecting to spend the amount of time I have on this game. it's ok sit back and have some you time.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This App is nice but still can not get all Radio Stations in area but good overall. I like getting Podcast  using app.
B008NB0SQO|1.0|For 20 years this has been my family's favorite Christmas movie. We watched it every year on our trusty VHS tape. This year I was excited to see the 20th anniversary edition. My kids are now grown and we got everyone together to watch the new edition.<br /><br />We were stunned when the song between Scrooge and Belle was cut from the movie. This 4 minute song demonstrates to the viewer why Scrooge was so bitter about Christmas. Why cut it now? It's 4 minutes! Without the song, the reprise at the end of the movie makes no sense.<br /><br />Also, Disney remastered the movie and completely lost the cold grey London feel of the movie. All the color chromo is turned to full bright and it looks like it's summertime on a cheap plastic movie set. Someone with a creative eye should re-remaster this embarrassing mess.<br /><br />Finally, Amazon should pull the star ratings on the previous edition. It is very misleading.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I look forward to reading anything Stephanie Meyer writes. If you haven't read &#34;The Host&#34; yet you are in for a treat!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen hit a grand slam !!!  Made me laugh, cry and gave me butterflies that you only get when your falling in love!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super fun! Its great for summer when you need to excersise your brain! Bridges, the sequel, is even better!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|This was mostly boring and predictable. I wanted to like this movie because I really like family guy. The only thing that saved this was Mila Kunis.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|As charming as these actors are, and they are engaging, the script feels like it was written by a young person who thinks all relationships succeed or fail based on how much sex everyone is having. (Maybe that's true, but I'm sick of those story-lines).  There's a fair amount of Hollywood drivel in this movie.  I had assumed these actors would have enough clout to do a realistic movie about marriage at that age.  Either they don't have that clout or, in real life, they are not nearly as deep as we like to think them.  My guess is this movie died by a thousand cuts of compromise and integrity.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love a little suspense and mystery mixed up with Bronte-esque love and quirky characters. I found all that in this book.
0316789798|5.0|Bought it for my son who likes to draw but I want to encourage him to draw more and pay attention to detail.
B000FC1192|5.0|Coraline finally gets to see what's behind a locked door in her flat. There's a passageway leading to a home with the exact same layout. Her \\"other mother\\" and \\"other father\\" reside there. Sure they have strange button eyes, but this world has great food and clothes--although, these things are artificially delightful. When Coraline returns to her real home, her parents have disappeared. She has to go back to the parallel world and face the dangers and creepiness posed by the \\"other mother.\\" Coraline must be brave to rescue her parents and three children the \\"other mother\\" has trapped. I don't know why I waited so long to read CORALINE. I'll definitely be rereading this.
B003Y5T0X6|3.0|Seemed really good when I first saw it, but even my 10 year old found it a little boring.  Helen Hunt does a great job, and I often wonder why she didn't have a bigger career.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|i have to write 20 or more words and so far I've only written fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, TWENTY!
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Like the big name actors, and it's actually scary.  Has enough of everyone's fears to be scary for all.  Writers work just within the framework of non-premium cable.
B0080CL0HM|2.0|I watched this movie cause I liked Rob. I just didnt like this movie or the plot.  It was boring in places.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. As a parent, I can totally see both sides of the pain that these families endured. As usual, I think that Jodi Picault did an excellent job at conveying the emotions of family and things that we pray never happen to us!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|As annoying as it may be to have to jump through hoops to turn this alarm off, all the options you can set for your alarms make this very robust, and easily one of the best and simplest alarms in the marketplace!  Well worth the money and then some!<br /><br />As a side note: I personally have better luck waking up with this alarm (regardless of the sound file playing) than I do with my jackhammer alarm clock with the vibrating pod and the super loud buzzer. This is a must have!
B0086700CM|4.0|This app was really fun, the part I like the best about it is that when you first get it before you start playing it out does you how to play it. Another thing I like about it is you can turn the volume of so it never plays so then you can listen to your own music.
B003YL4L0W|2.0|... And I mean prejudice against Christians, which clings like glue to the pages of this ridiculous novel. Picoult would like us to see that all lesbians, gays & atheists are just good, moral, honest, misunderstood people, but CHRISTIANS!! Watch out for these hypocritical, overzealous, cruel, lying fanatics. If Picoult is trying to drum up sympathy for her own gay son, this sure isn't the way to win people over.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Halfway through this book, I was overwhelmed with a strong feeling of peace and security.  This is the fifth book I have read about people who have made the trip beyond and then come back.  All of these books are similar. This book is the only one that mirrors what I have experienced in deep meditation, but with a clarity beyond meditation.  I recommend it for anyone who has lost a loved one (haven't we all?) and is grieving, and for anyone who just wants to come to terms with life and death.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|On my Kindlefire HD:<br />Cannot load all posts on this App as some remain in a &#34;Blue Fog&#34;. Also cannot  Share. Can only read (some) and like.<br />Disappointing
B005LAIIPS|5.0|First, this movie arrived on time and as new. It is a super movie and I cannot wait to watch it with my husband who like this type of show...it was great.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This was bought as a gift for someone who already had seasons 1-4.  They loved the other sets, so I know he will enjoy this one as well.
B0095T3H2U|1.0|This movie arrived as new and on time..That's all we can say about it...STUPID!!!! And most boring..but that's the chance you take when you listen to the hollywood critics...will try not to make that mistake again.
B0016BWACI|5.0|I had seen this when it first came out, and when I was asked to buy as a gift, I couldn't help but make sure it was in blu-ray.  As I have been asked to watch it with them, when they play it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|We bought this for our grandson who like action. And we trust Bruce Willis to make good, no bad language and sex movies.<br />He never disappoints us in his films. Too bad we can't say that about some of the others....
B0094BB4TW|1.0|i went ahead and downloaded this app on my kindle fire hd, hoping that the issue had been fixed since the last review was back in Oct. well i can only read 15 of my news feed and thats it. i hate that i cant read all the posts on this app. please fix this problem. Thank you
B0099114WO|1.0|I cannot say how very disappointed we all are.. We had friends over to see this movie. Merrel Streep has always made movies I was not afraid to allow our  teen grand children to watch. This is it! I cannot buy it and give to our daughters as they have already said they did not want it..they walked out of our home theater. What a shame. Again..we are disappointed.<br />However, the company who sold the movie sent it on time and as new....that is the only thing good about this horrid movie.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Seems as if every new release is better than the last and none are less than 5 stars. Can not wait for the next.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I finall got around to seeing what people have been talking about (seeing that I'm a Star Trek fan) and it's wonderful to watch the entire season with no commercials.<br />I look forward to more episodes with that crazy bunch
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I've played the IPAD version and this one. I like the IPAD version better because of the rewards but that aside, it's a good game. I enjoy playing it. It's worth the .99 cents.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Yup ... going back in time I'm watching them in reverse order (try doing that on TV)<br />Wonderful and I recommend  to all!
B001P5HI4A|5.0|...until it was FINALLY released on dvd. I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie several times. From the story to the music to the acting, it is a wonderful film that did not receive the recognition it deserved. Recommend.
B003ES5ZTG|5.0|I bought this to keep in my 'goes everywhere bag of problem solving make-it-work goodness.' So basically if I am on a trip, I have a back up hdmi cable with me. This one is perfect because it rolls up to fit in my small bag (about 6&#34; x 6&#34; x 2&#34;) it's also a good choice for this purpose because of the flexible ends- I can swivel and rotate the connectors to fit in any hdmi plug, even if its facing 'the wrong way.'<br /><br />Totally happy with this purchase, the price was great, and this cable goes everywhere.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|They try to cover all bases and manage to do so pretty comically!  I identified with Elizabeth Banks' character the most--\\"pregnancy sucks\\"!  My husband laughed a lot too, remembering what I was like when I was pregnant.  He also liked \\"the dudes.\\"  Touching at parts, but mainly just hilarious.  We loved it.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Watched it for ten minutes and then turned it off.  Nothing clever about the script and the profanity was overboard.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I &#34;bought&#34; this book because it was free. I'm not normally a romance reader (and didn't even know it was a Harlequin Romance until the end) but I did enjoy it. Ms. Kelly's writing is easy to read but not too simple. The story flowed well and had a nice ending.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This musical story was so well done that I watched it fourteen times.  The acting, singing and dancing were fantastic..
B007UXSPK2|4.0|bum bum bum ba bum bum bum  (dunna dunna dunna.... Duna!)  It's Tom Cruise dude.... just watch it already.  :)
0786948523|5.0|Great item for fans collectors. It has a great production and designs. It is a tall book, nice to expose on a desk or table. Recommended.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I'm pretty sure the one I received was a knock-off.  I had various issues trying to get this controller to work.  Look at the specs on the back of the controller for the battery.  The battery specs did not match that of an original controller (or at least the one I received).  I returned it and amazon refunded my money.  I bought one at Walmart instead. (This was my first Amazon return).
B0052AC8C6|1.0|I wanted to enjoy the movie but I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.  I usually try to see a movie to the end, but time is precious; couldn't do it.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|The music on this Muse CD is high quality and very upbeat.  My personal favorite song on this album is &#34;Hysteria&#34; because of the fast bass line.  I highly recommend this album to Muse fans.
1580084621|3.0|I suggest anyone interested in this book look at a hard copy first before deciding to purchase it.<br /><br />I am giving it a middle of the road rating (3 stars) for the reasons described below.<br /><br />The content is detailed and well-written.  The author is passionate about the subject and writes in depth about Thai culture and role of food in the culture.  About 150 pages of the 688 pages are dedicated to this subject.  I would personally prefer more recipes.  How can anyone fault an author for doing a job well-done?<br /><br />Some of the reviews written by other book owners are not true.  Virtually all ingredients used in the recipes are obtainable here in the US.  A home chef will have more success shopping in South-east Asian markets (Vietnamese, etc.) than Chinese supermarkets.<br /><br />Also bear in mind that some Thai produce is seasonal and available only at certain times of the year.<br /><br />One thing that let me down, I was really hoping for some new and innovative Thai dishes / recipes than the standards served in Thai restaurants or street food.<br /><br />Again, my recommendation is to preview a copy in the library (or of a friend's copy) before making the decision to invest.  You can then decide if all the recipes are a \\"must-try\\" or just 1 or 2 recipes justify the purchase.<br /><br />For me, I had greater expectations.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|this game is totally addicting. time waster. it takes no skill to be good at this game. it would be a really good game if it would actually save your progress and not put you back to wherever it chooses when you log back in. totally frustrating
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Bourne Identity is one of my favorite movies. I was hesitant to watch the Bourne Legacy for fear that the movie would not live up to my favorite.  However, as a huge Edward Norton fan I would not/ could not pass on watching the film.  I was pleasantly surprised on the cast performance as a whole.  I am definitely adding this movie to my collection.
B0095XPZBC|1.0|I've watched one episode on my 10ft projection screen and I felt like I've been had.  I would like to return this to amazon, but it's open ... all they can do is send me another equally inferior HD restoration.  A little annoying HD restoration on a 55\\" TV screen is unbearably annoying on a 10ft wide screen. I really don't want to watch the rest of the episodes ... so maybe I can beg amazon for a refund.<br /><br />Paramount should of waited a year between each season and do the restoration correctly.  Probably some restoration outfit that made the lowest bid, promised to do the restoration at warp speeds ... not because they were good at it with many years of experience with a lot of their reputation riding on the results ... nooooo... it was because they knew how to game the system, meet the contratual requirements (which were probably poorly written), and get paid and not suffer from poor feedback ... because they are laughing all the way to the bank!  I'll blame Paramount for writing poor quality requirements and not managing and demanding better quality before release.  I'll not buy another season until they correct the remaster for Season 2.<br /><br />Anyone have a direct email for paramount STTNG restoration team?  I feel like unloading my mind on them for such poor quality.  This is Star Trek, not some Gomer Pyle episode.<br /><br />Edit:  I lowered my rating from 2 to 1 after I saw the toy star ship with blue blooming engines in the Q episode with the borg.  Just a lazy effort with no consequences.  Too bad.<br /><br />Edit:  Dear Cody:  Since you watched Season 2, I'll respond.  The equipment I used (studio monitor and projector) to base my comments upon is all based on LUT image<br />processors.  It's what hollywood post production facilities use for the director to watch Blu Ray content prior to release to the public.  The dark shadow areas in Season 2 are<br />plagued with dark color compression artifacts (noise).  This is a symptom of poor quality source material (what you ended up after the remaster).  Season 1 did not have this.<br />Also, image detail was notably sacrificed as seen with the Star Ship Enterprise looking \\"toy\\" like, also a symptom of a poor quality master.  The point is that the people who did<br />Season's 2 remaster saw this, and still released it, knowing it was greatly inferior to Season 1.  It's professionally unacceptable and they need strong feedback from people who<br />have the ability to do so, as many others have done, to correct their behavior.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Very slow.... it was almost like they deliberately wanted to distance themselves from the comic book. Very slow and too dark to follow.
B00ARAO1LC|3.0|Very good performances, but the plot was lacking. It really is just a showcase for McConaughey. ANd that's all I can say!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Easy to follow for my 2.5 y/o, moves along at a good pace with easy to understand dialogue. So much that my kid is not \\"stunned\\" whiled watching but asks questions throughout.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I didnt see any of this on TV, but a friend recommended it.  I started the 2-season DVD at 8 am and watched the 2 season straight through to 1 am.  This is a lot of wonderful history/romance for this price.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|...started out ok, but by the end I was worn out. Too much fighting/chasing/shooting/explosions, etc., etc., etc. The original version with Arnie was much better IMO.
B0085YNML2|5.0|This is a very simple game to pick up, yet the puzzles can get pretty challenging later on.  The art and sounds are very clean, and well done.  I would definitely recommend this to any puzzle game lover, even the casual ones.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|There it is right at your fingertips.  No more guessing....get this app and be accurate once again, or at least close...
B004EPYZSK|5.0|good movie good movie great movie that was both goodly and greatly at the same time  yes it is very good
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Words? There are none that would adequately describe this book. Except maybe OMG ;)<br />There are books that are good, some that are great even, but every once in a while you get a knock off your socks-kick up your feet-ignore everyone and everything-read until your cross eyed and faint from hunger-kind of books.<br />Can I have my very own real live Holder please? And while I'm requesting characters, I'll add a Sky for my very best friend.<br />The synopsis didn't quite prepare me for what this novel had in store but it was better than I could have expected. The emotional roller coaster was one I did not want to end and was more than a little disappointed when it was over knowing I had to get back to real life.<br /><br />But this book. Read it. Love it and yell from the roof tops about the pure awesomeness that is this book.
B007QVLKI2|4.0|Great vocals and hamonizing.Can't want to hear more from this band.Love the Lakehouse and Mountain Song. To bad Little Talks is overplayed on the radio.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|Starts with a bang ends with a bang. I was'nt expecting that ending. Directing, acting very good. I've watched this 5 times already.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This was a great ending in this Batman chapter.The villians are awesome and complete the Dark Knight trilogy perfectly.<br />Christian Bale does his stellar best.Along with the rest of the cast. A little twist at the end is perfect.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Not your mothers faitytale. This is  a new twist on a childhood favorite. Charlize did a good job. Loved the story, the sets, and customs. Wish Red Riding Hood was as good.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great Mom/daughter music movie! Anybody who loves music will love it.  Funny, glitzy, love story, talent, has it all. Thumbs up.
B003Y5H556|1.0|Did'nt like the acting . Disappointed with story line. Was not my type of horror. Did not watch whole movie.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|Bought this for Christmas for my unicorn-crazy 5 year old.  Usual quality Schleich figurine.  I know my daughter will love it!
B001CTDH76|5.0|We just found this series this year accidentally, Unfortunately, we're a bit lost with the current season on CBS and TNT is showing them out of order. I'm going to buy the whole series.
B002FU42NE|5.0|Though the movie always makes me sad and depressed (because of Brandon Lee's death), I have always loved the soundtrack, and still listen to it.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I just want to say the best show on t.v.like it alot.I watch all the reruns on t.v. plus all the new ones.
0792846443|5.0|Misery is a classic. Absolutely love this movie. Recieved this really quickly in the mail, very happy and satisfied customer.
B00ADYYBFI|3.0|The songs themselves are great (especially \\"If I Didn't Know Better\\" and \\"Wrong Song.\\") My issue is with the producers' limited choice of songs. If your whole show is based on music, the album should reflect that. They're fortunate to have a large collection of amazing songs: so where are they?<br /><br />Where are \\"Fade Into You\\" and \\"I Will Fall?\\" Gunner And Scarlet are central to the show so the album should contain more of their music. Rayna's girls are adorable but I'd trade the novelty of their alternate version of \\"Telescope\\" for Scarlet's version of \\"(Love's) Burning Ring of Fire\\"-- which isn't available on Amazon as a single -- any day.<br /><br />This is part of an unfortunate trend: same thing happened with the \\"Smash\\" album, which was also missing several fan favorites. The only reason I can think of for missing songs is that ABC wants you to purchase the individual mp3's in addition to the album. Fans would be happy to pay $20 for a double album of all the songs... but ABC makes more money by gouging you for each mp3. Greedy, greedy.
B000000IUX|5.0|I chose a five star rating for this album because its always been a favourite of mine from Neil Young.The improved stereo from the Gold Disc mastering really brings an already great peice of music to the front of the sound tracks with better vocals and clearer instruments that are better seperated in true harmonics.It is a joy to hear some of those well played and sung tunes filling the air in a renewed harmony that lifts the spirits.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|it is my son who plays this, not me, and he loves it. it is his favorite game, and he declared it a good value as well.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I loved this movie! It is a great movie for any woman who is into Channing, Matthew, or male strippers ;]
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We saw The Lorax in the theatre and had to buy the DVD so we could re-watch. Danny DeVito has such a distinctive voice; just love him. Again, Amazon shipped super fast and the overall price, cheap. Who doesn't love THE Lorax?
B00003CXI1|5.0|They say the first movie is always the best, and this is no exception. I get all sentimental when I see where it all started.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|The extended version isnt that much different than the regular theatrical version. The movie was only good because of Charlize Theron
B000W746GK|5.0|I'm probably too old for these movies, but I'm unashamed. They're not the most amazing examples of cinematography but they're meaningful for all the right reasons.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|oh my gosh this game is sooooooooooo awesome! amazing graphics,  great gameplay, this game has got it all. the best part is, you can either do the missions or just go around the city fighting random crime. definitely  worth the 99 cents!
B009GEN0JO|1.0|I wanted to download to my computer and couldn't. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! Didn't want to just watch it, but wanted to OWN it.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|i love it! and you will too if you like zombies and comedies. remember to limber up and to buckle your seat belt.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Same thing paid for it not rec it yet....Do you want me to say more????? Ok since you insist. How would you feel????
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am an avid fan of Brittish tv series and mini-series. North & South is among the best maybe even the best. Great production quality and acting. Highly reccomend
1476715904|5.0|i read this book along with Point of retreat and it was AMAZING!<br />i loved everything about this book and i was hooked! i finished it in only one day....and i truely recommand<br />you get it and FAST. Colleen Hoover is a great writer ! i wish there will be a third novel..!:)
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Really good history, and a very enjoyable read.  I feel I will now be better prepared to watch to movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; .
B009DH371K|5.0|Sorry for the  Hungarians for not have a giant screen over the stage!!!<br />Freddie sing really great, god bless him!!!
030758836X|1.0|This book was a waste of my time.<br />I was avoiding this book for some time and finally gave in to the rave reviews.<br />Both of the characters were irritating and I only finished the book to find out what happened in the end rather than because I was caught up.  After reading all that time, only to reach an extremely unsatisfactory and stupid ending, I wanted to strangle both of the two idiot main characters. Don't waste your money.
B005EVVPUE|5.0|Good release, 2 great nights!!!<br />A terrific buy by my side!!!<br />Queen is the best band ever, i love them!!!
B009SQQRH2|4.0|This is a really cute movie to add to your Christmas movie collection...the kids will really like it a lot.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I have all of Two Steps From Hell's music. I am an Author of Sword and Sorcery Fantasy Fiction and I write while listening to music. SkyWorld and great tempo changes that inspire my writing for both action and less intense scenes. But to me it is a 5-star regardless of why you listen to Two Steps from Hell's music.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is our first time buying blu ray discs.  They are a nice upgrade.  The trilogy is a lot of fun and high action.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|Best yet.  I have 7 recordings of the Well Tempered Clavier  -- and this is my favorite.  It's so cleanly played.  To me, not using the pedal helps bring out all the lines of counterpoint.  And he plays the whole recording from memory.  Amazing.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|The only funny parts were in the trailer. The singing and dancing was bad and cheesy. Story super predictable and boring. Stay away.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|I've seen hard to find copies of this movie going for $80 and up, so the price is right here, but the cover, and complete lack of inner liner notes, seems cheap/cutting corners. The movie itself is quite the shock parade of some huge names in acting, and I think a great opportunity is overlooked by not including an inner liner with all the wild stories about the hijinx in making this film.
B000T433CO|4.0|The Holiday is predictable...but fun and fulfilling. We've seen it a few times and it hits all the plot points at the right time.<br />Worth seeing.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Probably considered the anti-MONEYBALL film, TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE is just as compelling a Baseball movie. Clint Eastwood again turns in another great performance since GRAND TORINO. This reviewer also liked the side-story romance in the film and the small-town locations which served as a kind of \\"character\\" in the film. The other actors in this ensemble which includes John Goodman, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, Robert Patrick, Mathew Lillard et al. are were cast perfectly. Justin Timberlake proves again that he works better in the confines of a support ensemble instead of a lead (i.e. THE SOCIAL NETWORK). The side story of the romance bewteen his character and Amy Adam's character is a nice touch with the baseball backdrop. Overall, with all the big-budget special-effects movies coming out during 2012, it's nice to see a small-budget contemporary baseball/romance film out there.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This for me is relaxing. I enjoy the series, being able to watch it in order is a plus. Will share it with my friends and family.
B000021Y7X|5.0|What an amazing concert film for those of us who grew up with the &#34;Heads.&#34;  I thoroughly enjoy these performance artists performing their music.  Great video and sound.  Some might find David Byrne creepy......I get such a kick out of this DVD.  I think he's fun, and he's obviously having a lot of fun in this performance.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Twists and turns that had me laughing and biting my lip in anticipation. Another amazing one from Riordan, keep them coming!
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Will Ferrell does his man-child schtick here, but he doesn't take it too far, and it's charming and quite funny.  Recommended!
B004AQR29C|1.0|Poor plot construction, amateur photography, big Hollywood names showing little acting.  Just dumb, but at least it was inexpensive !!!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I can't believe the author had an earlier book that didn't sell!  This story is beautifully written, a tapestry of language, plot and characters that the reader will hate to finish.<br /><br />Good life to you, Pi!!
030758836X|1.0|this book came looking like someone read it while wiping their peanut butter sandwich fingers on the cover and the pages themselves look warped, like they got wet. can't even use it not as a Christmas gift.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book really surprised me. I had heard such great things about \\"The Night Circus\\" and expected to be completely wowed by it, but the truth is that I found myself bored with it shortly after starting it, and as a result it took me a long time to finish. The premise of the book is mysterious: there's a magical circus that only appears at night, talented magicians, a cryptic challenge that binds two people together against their will, multiple love affairs...and yet, there's something lacking here. It's hard to pinpoint what the problem is. I felt that despite all the glittery components of the book, there wasn't a lot of passion in the story or the characters itself to make me really feel invested in the events that were transpiring. The characters were all interesting, but in most cases they all seemed kind of flat, and there was an emotional component missing from this book that could have really tied everything together very well. Also, the descriptive language the author uses to describe the circus is very rich and vivid, but after a while I felt like the book was just one description after another, and it got kind of old after a while. I'm sure this book will be made into a movie eventually, and I think there's the possibility of turning the film adaptation into something much better than the book it's based on, which usually doesn't happen. We will see. I'd give the book three and a half stars if I could.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|It was a excellent Christmas Gift for a friend! She has enjoyed it, she travels by Car in her work and has listened to it many times over!
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I have searched a while to get the series of SATC and Amazon had by far the best price! Since receiving the set, I am half way through the series and I have no complaints. Upon receiving the Cd's were completely wrapped and all in good quality.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was hooked from the very beginning.  A great cast of actors make this a must see sci-fi fantasy.  Nudity and violence make Game of Thrones for after you've put the kids to bed but a must see none the less.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|Glad i bought the movie instead of just renting it, ive watched it 3 times so far. 3 more words required....
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Every single sound works for me even on my motorola droidX &amp; it works perfectly on my Kindle Fire! BRAVO!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Really liked Clint's acting.  I thought the movie was a little predictable, but it did not disappoint!  Justin Timberlake is a decent actor.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|The movie has a great plotline with a lot of action. I think many people wonder weather or not our government is up to something this in reality which makes the Bourne series so interesting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book. Always kept me guessing. I read a lot but I haven't read a book quite like this. I love the author's style. Compelling read!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Great little princess decor.  Put the decor around her play room to make her feel like a real princess.  She loves it
B001M0HGR2|4.0|After watching Avengers we decided to watch the first two Ironman movies.  Great storyline.  A little slow at times but still a great movie.  Must see if you're into the Avengers.
B0039TD826|5.0|I have been a Stones fan since the 60s but for some reason didn't particularly care for this album when it came out.  That was my mistake.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|My favorite movie of the trilogy for sure. Quality was great, downloaded fast. I just love amazon instant watch. So much better than netflix.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Makes we wonder why I haven't been listening to her music more closely seven more words oh my required o!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It has action, humor and a little bit of everything else. I heard a lot of great things about this movie before I saw it.  So when I see it, everything I heard was true and I was not disappointed.
B00AIGQTEC|5.0|Love that beat.....reminds me of the early 80's music he palyed PLUS a new 2012 twist. We all know why he has been around for over 3 decades and this song proves his talent!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is a funny move and it is geared to guys. Remember this is a Seth McFarlane movie (i.e. Family Guy creator) and it will have a lot of swearing and off color humor.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Really enjoyed this one. Would highly recommend this for anyone that enjoys Vince Flynn. Can not wait for the next one.
B000I62JAK|4.0|Zoolander is one of those off the wall classics like Napoleon Dynamite.  But I think Zoolander is a funnier movie.
B009K0OL06|2.0|HD bogs down and you have to wait for it to catch up before the show resumes. We have watched the rest of the shows without HD because of that.  Loved the clarity on the HD but it just didnt work.
0307887960|5.0|I bought this book for a gift so I don't think it would be fair to rate this book, sorry.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|If the title intrigues you and you've gotten this far on your research, I'd say, go ahead and see it.  You are probably a good fit.  I was intrigued, but I guess my expectations weren't that high because I was suprised at how engaging it was.  The Lincoln character is sympathetic carrying his burden much as the original may have done.  Director Bekmambetov uses stop-action like a mogul.  The mood and tone are borderline transylvanian.  Nothing drags.  It's all sewn together seamlessly with invisible thread.  Bekmambetov knows how to fill the screen.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutely loved it. The story is more inspirational and deep than you may think at first, and it's written in a most original and amusing way.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Revolutions is a bit more complex to understand; it is definitely a great movie with a lot of twists and turns. However be mindful when you are watching because it can be tough to follow. However a great movie.
B00274EYKY|1.0|This wasn't a good movie, in my opinion.  Mickey Rourke really should call it quits where acting is concerned.  Its not that he's that bad of an actor, but his &#34;talent&#34; seems to have vanished to only a sliver of what it used to be.  And the cosmetic surgeries he's had have destroyed his good looks, which made it difficult to focus on the movie itself.  It's as though I could only focus on the oddity in front of me, of this face that I used to recognize.  Somewhere behind the horrible face lifts, is a familiar face that can only be seen in bits and pieces.  It makes me sad.<br /><br />Sorry for the rambling.  Back to the movie itself.  It's essentially about a washed up, used up wrestler-&#34;has been&#34;.  Depressing, really.  I found very little, if anything, in this movie that moved me one way or another.  I suppose if you are a wrestling fan, however, you might enjoy it.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This is my favorite of the 3. Matrix is a great trilogy and I really do think people should watch it. It is a bit complex but a ton of fun.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|While it's quite approach Guitar Hero in terms of polish this is a great app addictive play. Gripe is that if you have a smaller phone, the keys will be hard to press.
B00000K19E|5.0|I won't write a long review about it because it is so popular. It is a great movie, bit tough to understand, but definitely worth the watch. I would say you should definitely watch this movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like hidden object games, and this one appears to be ok. If you play it with friends it becomes more interesting.
0793573742|5.0|This book help to Know the Gibson guitars , technical info, details  , finishes from their guitars especially the 59 bursts.Very recomedable.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This takes a little more practice then the regular Angry Birds game. There are plenty of extra levels and games.
0547884591|5.0|I bought this book because I am a fan of the other 4 hour books, not because I wanted to cook.<br />That being said, I couldn't wait for this book to come out because I knew if it was like the other 4 hour books, it would by chock full of interesting and useful information, all about living life and living it efficiently. Thank you Tim Ferriss!  You've done it again!  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It works but for some reason it crashed. I will try to reinstall it. Then I will give a update on this app.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|...from Celine.  Everything this lady sings sounds so good; the duets on the album are memorable (even if you don't speak French).  The recordings are of excellent quality.  Highly recommended for the Celine Dion fan!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Books like this should be in every history class to show and remind kids that there is more to life than electronic gadgets.All the world is not free and what we have, so far, demands vigilence!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Good app, especially since it was free.  Manages to be playable for long periods of time.  Not bad for an app.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|What keeps the agent Pendergast believable was destroyed in this book. Did not enjoy Vinnie's betrayal as well. What's wrong with keeping friendship above all else.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As I neared the end of this book I was a little sad because this is one of those books that one wishes that the end did not  come so quickly.I plan to reread this book,even though I have re-read parts of it as I read it. Kudos to Doris Kearns Goodwin. Her brilliant intelligence,hard work and easy flowing prose makes this book a &#34;must read&#34; for  anyone with an interest in the  Civil War of the United States.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I watched this movie worried it would be boring as the last movie. It was actually very well done and worth watching. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because I cannot stand Christian Bale's Batman voice.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I plan to go read all the rest. I tend tto avoid non-fiction essays finding them difficult to finish. Hitchens style is intellectual but at the same time will hold your interest to the end.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|nice little seek and find game. good graphics nice story. I agree with the other reviews that complained about some of the screens being hard to see. on the spot the difference scenes you can not pinch and expand which makes it hard to spot the differences. over all it is a good game.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has a &#34;quiet thinker&#34; introvert in their life. It was both interesting an insightful. And in my case where both my husband and I are considered quiet a reassurance that quiet is &#34;ok&#34; in a world that can' t stop talking.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Who does not love the sound of Little girls playing<br />\\"Ring around the Rosey\\" as millions of people get sick? lol :)<br /><br />I bought this title for my cell phone on Play about 3 months ago.<br />It is so much fun.<br />The fungus map is my favorite.<br /><br />I have been waiting Amazon to put it up for sale for my Kindle Fire HD.<br />I find the bigger screen makes clicking on the Countries easier.<br />So... worth having to buy it over again. lol
B008JGSM6G|5.0|OMG!  This app is so easy to play. It can be addictive AND thought provoking because you have to find ways to get through each level.  Sure, the early levels are a breeze and you'll say to yourself &#34;what was that guy saying about thought provoking?&#34;.  Then you'll get into the more challenging levels and realize &#34;Oh yeah - he's right&#34;.  I don't know about anyone else, but I really enjoy this one!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is fun, but it's really too hard for younger kids.  I downloaded it originally for my kids, and helped them along with it, but it's really just too confusing for them.  They don't understand all the bits and gems.  Also to win this game and complete all the missions, you'd have to spend 250$ +.  I've never seen a game where \\"extras\\" were so ridiculously overpriced.  I can't believe that people are paying those prices for these things.  I really think the company would make more money if the extras were realistically priced, as I'd be willing to pay a reasonable amount for the extras you need to win, and I assume most everyone else would feel the same way.  In short, fun game, but don't expect to get very far without dipping heavily into your pockets.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has to be one of the best Solitaire games I have played and I like the customizations that are available.  Card backs, # of cards per draw, hints, undo's, etc.
B006O3MU96|5.0|I love this game soooooooo much my friend has the regular game and I couldn't find it free on my kindle fire so finaly I got it on my kindle I'm so happy!!!  :D
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I love the movie.  It's hard to say more when I'm just a super hero geek. :-)  I love how well-rounded they made him, and how he's easily related to, but still a hero.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the Walking Dead.  It is so great to have it for multiple viewings.  I can compare the book and the show often.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I was disappointed in this film. I thought it would be funny, but the joke got old fast.It would have been fine as a skit on SNL. Be warned, this is not a kids movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|This Is A Fun But Challenging Game.  I Do Recommend This To Others Who Love Challenges. Hope You Enjoy It Too
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Very solid new album. It is a very good mix of fast and slow songs. The band sounds great and the music rocks.I grew up listening to these guys and they still have it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its Fun But Gets Boring Because You Do The Same Thing Over And Over Again You Only Have A Few Characters Because The Characters Are Highly Priced With Coins I Recommend It At First But You Might Get Tired After A While
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|it is so much fun. and it is free. I loved it so much. this app is hands town one of the best I have seen. amazing on kindle fire.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|This Is A Good Game But Has A Few Problems On My Kindle. It Will Show A App Ad And Will Make Me Force To Close After A Few Tries Im Able To Play . Works Fine On My Cousins Tablet As Well. Hope You Enjoy It Too!

B00338QENI|4.0|This read was a very interesting look into Black culture of the fifties forward.  It was as well a glimpse into the world of research and treatment of minorities in the medical world in America.  As a child of the fifties, this book took a slice of life, in a particular region and brought it to life.  Most of us have heard of HeLa cells but few of us knew of Henrietta Lacks and her family<br /><br />This was an enjoyable read, written in a way that those of us knowing little of the world of medical research could enter.  A wonderful journey into the short life of Henrietta Lacks and the immortality of her cells.
0812550706|5.0|Ender is chosen, or perhaps created, by the international government's search for a fleet commander. Even in normal school, they single him out until he has to get in fights with other kids in order to make it. But the real test comes when he's only six years old, when they send him out into space to join Battle School.<br /><br />There, Ender advances far faster than anyone else ever has, rarely getting even a small taste of failure. The teachers are constantly messing with things to push him to his limits. Not only does he improve himself, but he teaches an entire generation of students a whole new way of thinking that vastly improves their skills. With his genius he starts to change the nature of the no-gravity shootout games that determine students' rankings.<br /><br />And it's in these games that you start to really respect Orson Scott Card's writing. At first he skims through situations because these are no challenge for Ender, but even there you can see the beginnings of strategy. In fact, the things you see Ender learning make you wonder if Card hasn't spent a bit of time in space himself! If battles seem a bit far away, it's because you're looking at them through a tactician's eyes.<br /><br />This is to say nothing of the big pile of moral dilemmas and other thought-provoking questions that are hidden in the text. Is Ender anything like his calculating, pain-loving brother Peter? And if so, is it because of who he is, or because Battle School made him that way? And most importantly, is it right to want to get rid of the invading alien force at all?<br /><br />Card purposely leaves all of these questions without a clear answer, and that only adds to the depth of this work. It gives an effect that I rarely see in any other book: it has that \\"literary\\" quality to it, but it's also a fast-paced adventure that keeps you reading.<br /><br />So there's definitely a good reason Ender's Game is the science fiction classic that it's considered to be. If you haven't read it yet, give it a shot--you might start to look at things in a new way.read it yet, give it a shot--you might start to look at things in a new way.

1400067820|1.0|If your IQ is under 150, I wouldn't advise trying to make sense of this book, unless you are persistent, have a free year-plus in which you have no other responsibilities, and are willing to make the decision to set aside one full day to try to make sense of one full page in the book, and then continue to work your way through the book, page by page, for the next 450 days.<br />I spent several hours trying to make sense of the first 20 pages and finally gave up. While I donate most books that are of no interest to me to my local library, I will actually be tossing this one into the trash. I wouldn't want to be the cause of someone else wasting their time.<br />So, are you \\"up to\\" this book? Here is a test. This is part of a sentence from page 20. If you can make sense of this, then the book might be of interest to you. If you can't make sense of it, you would be wasting your time and money, because the rest of the book is just like this. So, here goes:<br />\\"Now we aim - after some work - to connect in the reader's mind, with a single thread, elements seemingly far apart, such as Cato the Elder, Nietzsche, Thales of Miletus, the potency of the system of city-states, the sustainability of artists, the process of discovery, the onesidedness (sic) of opacity, financial derivatives, antibiotic resistance, bottom-up systems, Socrates' invitation to overrationalize, how to lecture birds, obsessive love, Darwinian evolution, the mathematical concept of Johnson's inequality, optionality and option theory, the idea of ancestral heuristics....\\"(and the sentence continues on and on and on. What I have quoted here isn't even the first half of the sentence.)<br />I can't attest to the mental abilities of the author. However, I am curious as to whether this book was even edited. It seems more likely that the author sent his unedited notes to the publisher, who immediately sent them to the printer without even reading them. Of course, there is the other possibility: The book was edited, but by someone who thinks exactly the the same way the author does. I suppose it is possible that two such people exist.

B00004TJKI|5.0|Hollywood hearsay alleges that Jimmy Stewart's dad was so offended by this film that he reportedly took out a local newspaper ad exhorting people to not see it. Way to support, dad. So, listen, ANATOMY OF A MURDER not only is one of the best, most polished courtroom dramas ever put to cinema, it's also one of the most controversial. Factor in that this film debuted in 1959, against the backdrop of the sheltered 1950s era, and you can see why some people threw a conniption. But director Otto Preminger always did like thumbing his nose at the Hays Code. And as a raspberry to the holier-than-thou contingent, ANATOMY OF A MURDER did rake in seven Academy Award nominations (but don't ask how many Oscars it actually won).<br /><br />In Michigan's upper peninsula, small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (Stewart) defends an Army Lieutenant accused of murdering the local barkeep who had raped and beaten his wife. Biegler enters a plea of \\"irresistible impulse\\" (a.k.a. temporary insanity) but knows his case will be difficult to prove. To quote Paul Biegler himself: \\"I'm just a humble country lawyer trying to do his best against a brilliant prosecutor from the big city of Lansing.\\" And renowned Assistant State Attorney General Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) truly does make for slick and utterly ruthless opposition. This movie runs two hours forty minutes, but Stewart and Scott's rambunctious courtroom sparring glues you to your seat. And lest you think Stewart gets all the choice lines, here's George C. Scott's eventual rebuttal: \\"Your Honor, I protest. Mr. Biegler is perhaps the least disciplined and the most completely out-of-order attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom.\\" Heh.<br /><br />The movie doesn't hold anything back in its explicit treatment of courtroom dialogue, and this crude frankness exhibited is probably what so incensed James Stewart's dad (again, way to support, dad). ANATOMY OF A MURDER is a pioneering picture in that it's one of the first films to address rape in such frank terminology. But note that the terminology, while deemed shocking and graphic in the context of the times, is appropriate in how it's applied during trial. ANATOMY OF A MURDER hews most faithfully to the spirit of the courtroom drama as most of the film does take place in the courtroom. However, this film also touches on all the basic stages, at least from the defense's perspective, of the American criminal justice system. We follow Paul Biegler as he goes thru client interviews and the arraignment process and then the trial itself.<br /><br />The behind-the-scenes stuff is almost as interesting as the film itself. ANATOMY OF A MURDER is adapted from Robert Traver's book. Robert Traver happens to be the pseudonym of real-life Supreme Court judge, John D. Voelker, who felt it inappropriate for a judge to be penning steamy courtroom thrillers (ergo, the alias). Voelker based the story on a 1952 murder trial in which he was the defense attorney. The judge in the film is played by real-life litigator Joseph N. Welch who famously scolded Senator Joseph McCarthy during the televised Un-American Activities hearings in 1954. Yeah, he was that brave cat who dared challenge McCarthy: \\"Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\\"<br /><br />It's one of the most perfect courtroom dramas put to celluloid, up there with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and TWELVE ANGRY MEN and INHERIT THE WIND. Would I call James Stewart's performance electrifying? I dunno. But he anchors the film, and he certainly mesmerizes as the defense attorney whose folksy demeanor masks a sharp legal mind. I enjoyed the theatrics his character engaged in, realizing that his desperate tactic hinges on putting on a show while hoping for the best. It's a long shot of a case, remember? I wouldn't be surprised if this role was instrumental in Stewart's landing a short-lived 1970s television series, HAWKINS, in which he also played a small-town lawyer.<br /><br />Part of the fun is in watching the bemused judge try to keep Stewart's antics to a minimum. But then George C. Scott gets into the act. The film also benefits from Duke Ellington's bluesy compositions. The score enhances that grittiness coursing thru the story. It ups the sexy. Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick are stand-outs as, respectively, Biegler's hostile client and his kittenish wife. Gazing at Gazzara's stone-cold expression, from jump one wonders at him... Gazing at Lee Remick's curves and blatant coy behavior, one questions her sincerity. Remick is terrific at conveying a sense of ambiguity, casting doubt but layering in enough vulnerability that you end up checking yourself. Eve Arden, meanwhile, provides wisecracking levity as Stewart's faithful secretary. Except that ANATOMY OF A MURDER, overall, is no laughing matter. It is bold and thought-provoking and, in its time, highly controversial. In the courtroom, several characters utter the word (cover your ears) \\"panties.\\"he fun is in watching the bemused judge try to keep Stewart's antics to a minimum. But then George C.

It has the best action in a superhero movie to date, some of the best humor and does an excellent job of balancing four separate franchises and other major characters introduced in those franchises.<br /><br />The plot is uninspired, the resolution is convenient but you'll have so much fun watching it happen you won't care. 'Nuff said.

0765357151|5.0|I must admit to having been a huge I Am Legend fan for a long time. I enjoyed the book and 3 film adaptations. Vincent Price, Charlton Heston and even Will Smith. What a great cast (but I digress). The novel is a very good read and it is probably Matheson's best work. Robert Neville is the main character. He has watched the world fall apart, buried his family and searched for a cure after a worldwide crisis left no one else except a group of rampaging vampire/zombies who are the only known survivors. You do get a sense of dread as the story unfolds. If you like the armageddon, post-apocalyptic, futuristic style of story then I Am Legend is right up your alley. Stephen King was also greatly influenced by Matheson. This is old-school horror at its finest. One Man vs. The World. It almost always turns up into Man fighting Himself, Other Men, and Enemies also. He is not really alone at all yet he knows the world is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. The book asks a valid question about who we are and what we are capable of doing in an emergency. If you liked 28 Days Later you will appreciate this. If you liked the I Am Legend film or are a Richard Matheson fan it's hard to pass up. Matheson also wrote What Dreams May Come, Stir of Echoes, Hellhouse and Somewhere in Time (amongst many others). Highly recommended.<br /><br />Buy this book. I cannot speak about the quality of the movie tie-in edition but Matheson's original novella is considered one of the best cult horror novels and best vampire story since Dracula. Many editions include short stories from Matheson as a bonus so shop around for the copy you want.

B004GTLFNW|4.0|First the weaknesses:<br /><br />1. As a professor emeritus of biochemistry and an avid student of exercise physiology (I am a former marathoner and triathlete), I must say that some of the details the science in this book are not supported by the research but are the authors opinions. For example, the benefits of aerobic exercise are well known and well established, for heart health and emotional well being. There is no reason for the author to try to pit his program against that of runners, cyclists, and swimmers. Besides, aerobic exercises have benefits that go well beyond looking good and losing weight. Furthermore, the authors recommended amount of fat in the diet far exceeds the required amount for normal humans and is actually unhealthy for the heart. The recommended 30% fat in the diet might work for strength training but it is miserable for heart health.<br /><br />2. I was hoping that all the exercises could be done in a hotel room, but alas, many of the exercises require specific types of chairs, tables, doors, shelves, boxes, books, etc., that are not normally found in a hotel room. I was surprised at the \\"equipment\\" needed in a book that is supposed to be all about using only the body as a gym. For example, I temporarily live in an apartment in Spain, and my apartment doesn't have a table on which I could do Let Me Ups nor a doorway that would let me do Chin-ups.<br /><br />3. As a 68-year-old man, I'm just not in the kind of shape that I can do even the most basic exercises for the time recommended by the author (as other reviewers have mentioned).<br /><br />Now for the strengths:<br /><br />The above problems are not that difficult to overcome. The bad science might be a weakness, but it is only a minor distraction from the main purpose of the book: to provide a great set of body-weight exercises that can be done at home, in an apartment, or on the road.<br /><br />With creativity, most people will be able to find substitute exercise (or, for weaklings like myself, less time on each exercise) with the equipment and furniture at hand. For example, I have an elastic exercise band that I carry with me when I travel that I can use instead of many of the exercises that require furniture or books (as weights) or other hard-to-find items.<br /><br />The key to making use of the book is to adapt the daily routines to personal needs, fitness level, and equipment available. I plan my own program, trying to get in at least one of each of the four major types of exercise each day: Push, Pull, Legs, and Core.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is an excellent book for what it is intended to be. The title says it all: [[ASIN:B004GTLFNW You Are Your Own Gym: The Bible of Bodyweight Exercises]]. Readers just need to be a little careful with some of the science and do some creative personalization of the exercise programs. Combined with the iPad app that has videos of most of the exercises, this is a great strength-training system.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|Cornwell has made an effort with this book to bring the Scarpetta series back on track; however, it did fall a tad short. Acceptable (meaning I was able to finish it), but definitely not up to the first half dozen or so efforts that captured our imaginations...but not as bad as the preceding recent efforts...and this is #20 in the Scarpetta revenue stream.<br /><br />In my opinion, Cornwell went off-track with Scarpetta years back when she started making the characters appear persistently dysfunctional rather than them having momentary periods of human frailty. Her niece Lucy went from being an exciting, intelligent, major player in the series to being a hard-to-believe damaged psyche that is interjected now and again to accomplish Brobdingnagian technological tasks to forward the plot.  Husband Benton went from a mysterious, multi-layered FBI profiler to being a one dimensional bore. Pete Marino is the hardest of all to accept. The first two have a familial relationship with Kay Scarpetta. Pete, her lead investigator, does not. This emotionally impaired character is a hard drinking, tattooed biker/ex-cop and verbally abusive employee who continually flouts her direction...to say nothing of having attempted to rape her in a previous novel.  And yet, he remains happily employed.  Our `beloved' protagonist appears to spend more time psychoanalyzing her employees and herself than she does solving crimes...and the pace screeches to a halt.<br /><br />In The Bone Bed, Cornwell unfortunately starts out with another rambling amateurish psychological evaluation of Pete Marino which caused me to strongly consider stopping the read right out of the chute. The original character construct of Pete Marino was a good one which unfortunately Ms. Cornwell could not leave alone.  I am tired of hearing about the myriad of complaints about Marino which would have caused anyone--other than Kay Scarpetta apparently--to have fired him. It is just not believable. I will say though that toward the end of this novel Ms. Cornwell seemed to begin adding just a smidgeon of stability back into the Marino character. Here's hoping.<br /><br />Eventually both Cornwell and Scarpetta get moving doing the things that they do best. Very enjoyable descriptions of the forensic pathology world and a relatively fast paced mystery eventually evolve. Cornwell keeps us guessing as she moves from one possibility to another using multiple misdirection. I guess the ending was a tad deflating to the mystery reader only because there was the obligatory interjection of the protagonist into the final scene which was difficult to accept as anything other than a forced maneuver by the author as well as another condemnation of the common sense of Scarpetta...and the actual antagonist was fairly impossible to determine (or even guess) until the end because...well, read the book.  I will say however that it was disappointing primarily because it did not take much author ingenuity and made the reader feel a bit `played'.<br /><br />And yes, I'll buy her next installment just to see if she does in fact begin to mend these originally likeable characters...but I'll read some reviews first.  Let the books focus primarily on the mystery, not the character foibles.ward the end of this novel Ms. Cornwell seemed to begin adding just a smidgeon of stability back into the Marino character.

I like coming of age stories so I grabbed it last night and read it through in one sitting.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book, by the end I was moved by the characters and felt a sense of nostalgia for my own high school years. The main character delivers the narrative through letters sent to an anonymous friend which I think makes the tragic and disturbing elements of the story more impactful. The author doesn't try to whitewash the kinds of situations that some teens find themselves in but doesn't come across as an after-school special either.

B004IQMXD4|2.0|I am keeping my review short and to the point which probably won't be as helpful as others. I think the production is naive and takes away from the raw emotional power of Nicks' voice. Sadly, I know Stevie is a good songwriter but the songs just do not resonate with me this time around. My main problem with the album is that no one song really sticks out for me. It's monotonous and lacks growth or diversity in it's instrumentation and sound. It's a snore. Shangri-la had more change up and variation which I could appreciate. I hope the next one is better, but I am sure some of you will enjoy the album. I just didn't and it saddens me since I am a fan.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The action kept this movie going but it seemed like this version had even less plot than the previous Total Recall.  I think it may be confusing to people who had not seen the original.  They updated the technology and in some ways tried to make the story more believable (like the fact that no one can go to Mars).  Since it's still set in the future the future Earth is still depressing like the original.  It's good for the action, I'd watch it again.

It's interesting hearing a vampires own thoughts when faced with their impending immortality.<br />The story is told from Luis' point of view and sense the premise of the book is an 'interview with the vampire' it is essentially told in the third person so to speak. The story line, descriptions and events are perfect in the unique way that they are presented. You do feel like you are listening to an interview and that the person being interviewed is telling a story.<br />What's wholly interesting about Luis is that he has a tormented soul, truly, Luis is a mortal vampire at heart. His fear, love and loathing live on in his vampire soul and it creates such a fractured beauty. It is only until the end of the story that Luis realizes threw strife and pain that this morality is a weakness for him. If only he could have removed himself from these mortal feelings, his path, and the path of others close to him, may have had a different outcome. Essentially I feel that it was Luis' own morality that destroyed him.<br />I loved this book so much, it was both tortured and beautiful. Truly a unique story telling by an original author. Anne Rice has become yet another of my favorite authors and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series!<br /><br />The Vampire Lestat...<br /><br />Lestat awakens after a long sleep state and finds the world is a different place. He comes upon a book entitled \\"Interview With A Vampire\\", a story given by Luis. Lestat is enraged and feels Luis has lied about him. Lestat wants to take this new world on, tell his story and \\"come out\\" to mankind and \\"call out\\" his brethren.<br />The Vampire Lestat is essentially that tale. It is Lestat's biography so to speak. The story tells of Lestat's beginnings and the life that led up to the meeting with Luis.<br />Within Lestat's own Biography there are also mini biographies by vampires Lestat has crossed paths with such as Armand and Marius. These stories cross over seamlessly and give you a multiple and full prospective of the story.<br />I love this tale, it felt like it explained so much more than Interview With a Vampire, I felt like I understood the story more. I guess Anne Rice planned it that way, story and plot wise it makes sense.<br /><br />Queen of The Damned...<br /><br />I love Baby Jinx's story..Anne Rice writes that story perfectly. We saw Baby Jinx damaged, tortured and lost. I love the death scene at the end. In my mind it is the most perfect description of the afterlife and I love it.<br />The queen of the Damned spanned so many stories that all fit together. Lestat is chronicling these stories and in this third installment we see the Mother herself awakened. When Akasha awakens she finds her prince in Lestat and she enforces a plan in which she plans to exact peace.<br />Akasha's plans for peace are however disjointed and as the story unfolds, and the undead gather together to stop her, we hear the vampires story and history.<br />All three of these books truly flow together as if Lestat truly wrote them. The are full and rich stories and feel more like history than fiction.raphies by vampires Lestat has crossed paths with such as Armand and Marius.

B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If you're a fan of The Hangover-type humor or any of the Seth MacFarlane cartoons, you'll love this movie. There was absolutely no political correctness in this movie, and that's refreshing.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out because I love Mark Wahlberg.  I hadn't laughed that hard during a movie in a long time!  So, I had to purchase it for my Kindle when it was released!  Totally funny movie and I keep picking up new things each time I watch it.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|omg this totally extented my battery life this is just awesome everyone should get it!!<br />I am so glad I bought this app! !
B004SIP8OI|5.0|Great movie by Quentin Tarantino. Like his other films there is a lot of talking. But it is filled with dialogue that will have you intrigued and entertained. There is top notch action, mixed with a little drama and comedy. If you etch and find parts cheesy- know that it is supposed to sound like that, and just go with it. Parts 1 and 2 are both great.<br /><br />Got both parts quickly. Ordered them thanksgiving morning and They were in the mail box on Monday. Pretty good for the whole holiday shopping/shipping rush
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Just what my wife need to go with her collection. If your into Vampire Movies, It's A must see. Thank You
1423140605|5.0|My nine year old grandson loves these books!!  This author has created such an interesting series, creating an incredible positive to their reading experience:)  He has moved to a 7th grade reading level because he enjoys these SO MUCH!!!!
B00004YTIQ|1.0|I bought it for my Grandsons Pool ( Which was the correct pool) and after a couple times it was tearing. would not recommend. I would of returned it but didn't want to pay return postage. Not Happy
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you're looking for an incite into metalearning and some great cooking tips, this book will hit the spot and leave feeling full of all sorts of useful knowledge.
034580404X|5.0|My wife loves to read, This is what she wanted, so I got it for a gift for her. Thank You
B008KE3960|4.0|Great change of pace for tower defense games and keeps you way more involved because of the fact that your towers not only can move, but do move.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This is the funnest game I've played in awhile. Its impossible to complete every quest with every possible way to win, but jusy finishing the levels can be an acomplishment in itself.  I like this game because unlike many other games on droid there is an ending and an evil boss to kill. Its a new version of Super Mario bros and well worth trying.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My 11 year old really enjoyed this movie.  She wants us to buy it, which inevitably we will.  Fun for Christmastime and any other time as well.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Great Buy, was skeptical on purchasing but thought about it long enough and i was very pleased with the features and bonus materials.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is great!  It might be a little scary for very young children, scary angry bears and witches included, but great fun for the older kids.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Great Buy, was skeptical on purchasing but thought about it long enough and i was very pleased with the features and bonus materials.
B001706I5I|5.0|I have an 11 year old, she loved this movie and watched it several times.  It's a fun take on the Seuss tale.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i just started playing this awesome game. I cant put this game down and would recommend this to anyone. Better version of super Mario brothers.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|A little bit of everything here.  Fans of Marvel will enjoy it, young and old will get a kick out of this one.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Not only was this a great Saturday afternoon movie with the family (we're all adults in mine, folks), it was a well-conceived story. This is, of course, is due to having great material from the book, but is also the mark of great filmmakers. This is worth your time and is well filmed and presented.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love this movie - and apparently 17 more words are required for me to submit this review so here goes....
B007ZCOT6C|4.0|I like this book because it has forbidden romance, an amazing storyline about love, trust and great characters that you can't help but fall in love with. I also found it quite funny at times.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Good read. What i perceived would be an inside scoop really left me wondering how good the author really is.
B008OOYALE|2.0|its a good way to pass time and its fun to watch the dragons... but thats about it. everything takes way too much time. It's almost like they do it on purpose just to get you to pay money. I really think the habitats and buildings are way too bulky and huge. It looks dull. I kept getting a blue screen in the game and it kept freezing.
B004J4WL50|5.0|Highly recommend this book to anyone looking to make a positive change in the world. Filled with stories of helping others through courage, caring, and simple ideas. Blake's story is touching and highly inspiring. Start Something That Matters!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I saw the 1st one and I enjoyed it.  This was entertaining also.  I love to see the cameos.  All of our heroes however are getting old and it's time to find new action adventure heroes
B001974DG0|5.0|You will never look at animals the same way once you have read this book.  It brings to life the fantasy that most children have had about being able to communicate with their pets.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It kept me interested till the end.  I would enjoy another one.  Downey could be our new action hero in any movie he makes.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I picked amazon movies over Netflix because the pick of the movies was better and I had a choice of the quality of the movie I could view. The prices are good and I enjoy Amazon. I don't have any problems with the buffering.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I love Batman movies this one however was missing something I don't know what it was.  It get's old the same story.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I gave the movie as a Christmas gift. She love it and had want it sense she watched it and the price could not be beat.
B003KK6GJQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to people of all ages. The book touches on a very sensitive subject, very well written.<br />Great author .
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Although the review is for the service more than the movie, just thought will mention it :-)<br />Not an issue making the purchase or even accessing the prime option on my tv. I did have an issue during the streamline of the movie and I have checked with my Internet provider and doesn't seem to be their problem... Who knows. In any case, it was easy to get and the picture and sound was as great as being at the movies.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is a season of TV viewing to keep you enthralled with all the deceit and plotting it could possibly fit in. Just when you think all is going well another curve ball comes and the twists and turns keep you watching with baited breath. Can't wait for the next season as Emily continues her revenge for her familys demise.
B004RLEBTY|4.0|Solid stuff in the vein of Baroness, The Sword, or Mastodon.  If you're into that sound, I definitely recommend it.
B0058YPL66|4.0|This is one for all the family. It puts all the story book characters together in a town called Storybrooke after Snow White's evil stepmother has cast a curse on them removing them to our world with no memories of their former lives. It follows the attempt of Snow White and Prince Charmings grandson to bring back their happy endings and restore their memories, with snippets from former lives intertwined with their current situation. The charachters and their interactions aren't always what we would assume or what we have read in the books, their relationships explained under a different light. Much easier to follow in DVD format that by weekly installments. Watch and enjoy.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|After I finished the book,  I shuttered at how easy this event could happen in the real world. For a moment I felt very vulnerable using the internet.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|So glad I read this book. Amazed that this young man so easily grasped what most of us barely understand and then was able to build it! Should be required reading in American schools as a demonstration of both the power of the human mind and what people who have so little can accomplish. Most of us with all the privileges in the world don't manage half of what this kid did by the time he was a teenager. Inspiring.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is awesome!  but the ghrapics Mindanao lost me at the point.make better ghraphics seriously. you guys. can do better than this.good luck
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Reminded me a bit of Eat Pray Love in it's &#34;searching for self after loss&#34; theme.  I found the end kind of dragged on & the ending seemed anti-climactic.
B008MILL9G|4.0|This is one of the best sequel of movies. It's really a adventurous movie to watch. The starcast is awesome. To watch Brad Pitt and George Clooney together it was a delight....
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Rented for 48 hours...feel asleep the first night. ThoughtI was just tired. Tried watching again the second night feel asleep again. Moves too slow.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This backpack contains slots to accommodate everything for a camera. The size is also very good to carry over for all the places.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Everything you could ask for in a drama suspense. So tired of superhero save the world movies. Nice to have something that actually has a plot
B00319ECGK|5.0|One of the best science fictions to have been released ever. Good script, good execution, good acting. Everything is good about the movie.
B0000524EM|5.0|it is my favorite movie i am not as fond of the later movies but like to have all the movies in a particular series to keep it all together
B001992NUQ|5.0|Whoof!!! What a movie!!! One of the best sci-fis to have been directed ever. The movie will confuse us like anything.
1932100385|5.0|This book along with the DVD Forks Over Knives has changed the life of this 64/yo RN. Colin Campbell, M.D. has presented a scientific study of thousands of people and the effects of what we eat on our health and longevity.<br /><br />Hopefully what he has written will help others change their perspective on what they choose to eat.  It sure has changed the way I look at food.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|One of the best from Quentin Tarantino. I think this is probably his best work. Chritolph Waltz stole the show.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids have been playing angry birds for years on my siblings phones. Just recently I bought a tablet and decided to download the app to see what all the fuss was about. This game is addicting. Fun for everyone in the family. My husband loved it so much he got the app on his phone too. I have to admit I probably will also. And the other angry bird games.
B003TT2X72|5.0|The best sequel of movies that have ever been produced. This is the best fantasy movie that I ever watched.
B008BGNMZU|3.0|I love the super group fourplay I have seen them in concert several times. maybe I have not played the cd enough to let it grow on me. But usually I don't have to do this with a fourplay cd thats why I rated it OK
B002M9WW30|5.0|One of the best action movie sequels.... Sylvester's acting would be exceptional throughout the movie. The script is also really good.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|You can understand the issues of war and the effects in people and their emotions. The author give you a different point of view.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved all of these books! I couldnt get enough of the characters & story line. Sure the book could have used more editing but still a great read! I would recommend this book to everyone...men & women alike.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very easy to use and use friendly on the kindle fire. Really like the fact that you can see the last numbers entered.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|As a professional and a team leader this book is a must have. Will help you understand yourself, your team the way to mastery between many other related topics. Great examples and ideas to implement. Thumbs up.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|CAN WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE LOVED THE PLOT KEEPS YOU IN. HOPE THE NEXT ONE IS AS GOOD AS THIS ONE
B004UPANAI|4.0|Excellent movie. Saw this in the movies but it was good to see again.  Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|THIS WAS AN AWSOME MOVIE IT HAD LOTS OF ACTION LOVED SEE ALL THE MAVRALS TOGETHER CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!
0307719219|5.0|Acemoglu and robinson offer an insightful and thoroughly researched explanation of international economic disparities, along with an intelligent and practical plan as to how to move forward and cope with these disparities
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Watch it over and over.  Would recommend to anyone who loves a good romance or chick flick.  You'll watch it more than once.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game really is a lot of fun for when you have nothing to do. Some of the games on here are somewhat challenging but I could play this app for hours!!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  This is one of those movies you watch when all the boys go to the ball game for the day.
0810996596|5.0|I really enjoy books that give you a look into the personal collections of those gracious enough to share them with others.  Like Kirk, I love the classic horror films and am sincerely thrilled with this book.  I know those who also share this passion will embrace this book for it's sheer fun factor.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is very awesome at passes time so quickly And has so many games it make Christmas come faster hay I cant wait
006097625X|5.0|Hands down my favorite text book ever.  It talks about all different topics around 'comics' while also being in complete comic form.  Book came quickly too.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I would recommend this to those married a long time.  It was poignant at times, funny and kept your interest.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bought this for my kindle.  Came immediately as always.  If you read the first two you have to read the third.
B009B0L324|5.0|The only real way to listen to AC/DC is LIVE, and LOUD!  This two CD set is worth it's weight in gold!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Great movie for a quiet even at home. The movie had plenty of laughs! We did this as an Amazon Instant Rental and playing the movie worked great over the XBox.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|This CD has some songs reminiscent of the 70s band we all grew up with and loved.  The thing that seems to be missing is the raunchiness they once had.  Too many rehabs maybe?  The ballads are just too 80s for me...  Worth the buy only if you are a true fan of the old band.  Glad I got it at the Black Friday sale price of $5.  I would not have paid a penny more!
B005LAIGSC|2.0|I got this for a weekend away with friends, and the guys liked it, but it seemed a bit grim and chaotic for me.  I think Denzel was a bit too down right serious throughout, and the show just didn't grab me.  I've seen him in better films.  Fine for a space filler, though, on a long weekend with nothing to do.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Outstanding live album  Jason Bonham has invoked his father's spirit, and shines with the founders of Led Zeppelin Live 2007
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Not quite as much as the other two books, which were slightly more fast-paced and action packed.  A satisfying enough end to the trilogy.  All three books were great to take to the gym on my tablet's Kindle App.  The books aren't amazing pieces of literature, or anything, but they are entertaining and really suck you into the story and action.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Didn't come close to the first movie.  The plot was silly.  I wasted my money renting it.  I'm glad I didn't go to the big screen to see it.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|Being a huge fan of Les Miz, I was excited to pick up this soundtrack and hear the score in a new light.  What a huge disappointment.  Not only are the orchestrations horrible (why the heck did they feel the need to re-orchestrate?), but those that can sing overact and most of the actors on this album just can't sing.  Why on earth would they cast Cohen and Carter as the Thénardier's?  I will never understand how anyone thinks Cohen is funny (although I did like him in Sweeney Todd) and Carter is just worthless.  Not only can she not sing, she whispers her part of \\"Master of the House.\\"  Speaking of \\"Master of the House\\" - what a debotchery. The song is the worst of the lot by far.  I appreciate what Hathaway attempts with \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" - I mean a devastated woman is signing this song - it shouldn't be beautify.  However, she completely over-acts.  Jackman is ok.  All in all, I think the cast suffers more from the horrible orchestrations than anything else.  However, Crowe simply cannot sing.  I am hoping these songs come across better in the context of the film, but I have to say this soundtrack is worse than the POTO soundtrack, and I didn't think that was possible.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It is sometomes difficult to keep up with all the action & the intracies of this exciting movie, but we throughly enjoyed it.
B001706I5I|1.0|Tried to watch movie with granddaughter but could not. Picture was very blurry and I tried various settings on TV to no avail. we ended up getting movie from cable company which cost a little more but picture was perfect.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is easy to play. It takes a while to load though.  I'm glad it doesn't take money to play it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The box came in a couple days earlier than expected. Came as described and met all my expectations. Couldn't be happier. I have not had the chance to watch it all but epect to remain satisified with the performance.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|no really. there was no surprise. there was no horror. there was no acting. another movie built around an agenda with wicked special effects, fails again... 2012 anyone? heh heh. heck the story would have been fun if it wasn't so lamely put into action. at no point did this movie suck me in and make me believe or care. i just watched it... and that is NOT why i watch movies
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|The box came in a few days earlier than expected. Came as described and met all my expectations. Couldn't be happier.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I can't believe after all this time, that I still laugh like I do.  And after six seasons I can finally sing the entire song word for word.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|My daugher recommended that I watch Moonrise Kingdom - a very feel good movie - according to her.  It is a bit quirky but I enjoyed every minute of it - chuckling out loud at many times throughout the movie.  I would watch it again.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Im sorry I didn't watch AHS from the beginning, but it was amazing to catch up.  The plots are twisted, macabre, and the humor is so black and dry and good.  Pure dark entertainment.  Jessica Lange is an amazing actress, watching her, along with a supporting cast of great actors is like candy.  One of the best surprises for me was seeing Denis Ohare from True Blood, who ranks as one of my favorite character actors.  Some of the actors from Six Feet Under take bizarre roles as well, Frances Conroy and James Cromwell are back together in a weird twisted plot.  But Jessica rocks it.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Commercials in the middle of my game!!!! REALY!! Over all a good app fun to play and has a lot of potential!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|No character development like in first film, might as well be a video game. What about the poor folk on mars, we never even met them.
B007HO392S|5.0|She is just awesome! You won't be sorry with this CD. Even the cover is A-one. I give it an &#34;A&#34;!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It does keep you from dozing, but far from the best of the series. Probably have to see it two or three more times to understand the plotline.
B002VX0A40|5.0|The dragon is super cute very colorful, durable and best of all my baby loves it! :) it has that crunchy sound in a few places, a little mirror on its tail an it's holding a rattle
B007HO392S|5.0|This is one of her best albums.  I love her voice, passion and message in her songs.<br />She is as beautiful inside as she is on the outside.  I love her humor, too.
0307155102|5.0|Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever was a gift for my grandson.  He loved it so I do too.  His mother loved Richard Scarry's books when she was a child.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I've been a fan for several years and never knew who Adam was since The Voice, I've<br />fallen in love with him more his voice, he's HOT, his weird personality shall I go on?<br />His body, tattoos, talent.  Well, anyway great songs can't wait for more
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Better than the freebie. I really like listening to talk radio or my favorite music. It is a must have on your Fire.
B0064Y5U24|4.0|Again, Nickelback mixes it up and comes up with some great songs.  Strong and caring tough and naughty. Can't wait for the next album
B00A0A6F7C|4.0|I love hearing susan Boyle sing.  She has a wonderful voice.  She is one of the best singer today.  Thank You
B008HT4FUW|2.0|We just watched season 1 and there were only 2 episodes??  What are we missing?  We loved what we saw, but there has to be more episodes per season!  Please respond if anyone has thoughts on this.<br /><br />Thank you - Gina Burkhart
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Another purchase for my son. He has a blue ray player now, he is building a collection of movies on blue ray.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game for the kids they have fun with it.<br />it is a great way to keep them thinking and helps with their motor skills
B008QTVNUI|5.0|A fascinating story of two damaged individuals driven by their intense personal crusades to commit and prevent a terrorist attack.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|wasn't sure how good it was by just watching the trailer. decided to give it a try.<br />  i was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. natalie portman is awesome.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It works as expected. I can download files and easily access them. So far absolutely no problems with this app.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This whole series makes me smile. There is great chemistry between Castle and Beckett. Love it. Hope there are five more seasons.
B0084BMUFA|1.0|My bookclub was reading this book so I figured it was a classic and free so I would go ahead & \\"purchase\\" it on my Kindle. From the very beginning I was having trouble with the writing style. I trudged through thinking \\"this is a classic, everyone loves this story, it must get better\\". It never did. I only finished it for the bookclub. Otherwise I would've given up after the ghost of Christmas past.<br /><br />You would have to appreciate this writing style to enjoy this book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love this book!!!!! There is no slow moments in it which is the kind of book I love!!!!! Must read!!!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Really wanted to like it, but acting was flat. Characters were dry, really could not identify with any of them. Special effects had promise but were used willy nilly with no punch. Overall, sorry, it just was not interesting.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so addicting. Me and my freinds be playing this all tha time when we in school. Yall need to try this game. AND ITS FREE!!
B007F7XXKA|5.0|I just love this book. Gives you a perfect context of world markets and nations as markets, considering all of their characteristics, being economic policies, strength, and risks. The best thing about though, is that it gives a benchmark on what works and what doesn't, a kind of forecast for the future ahead, but as a context, not as a deterministic outcome.<br />The description of how capital markets move and the comparison of the dot com bubble versus the commodity bubble in their outcome as benefit to our economic system is right on the money. I am specialty pleased with the chapter on Mexico, it gives a great description and points out the main problem of our economy, one that I have argued for some time now, and I am afraid will take more than what our leaders are eager to do.<br />All in all it was a great and pleasant reading. It excited me all along.<br />Humberto Villarreal, Monterrey, Mexico
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great battery app. Does exactly what it promises. Love the notification that it gives when fully charged. Would be more than happy to buy it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|a must add to any family movie collection me and my kids enjoy watching this one over and over again
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Worst movie made this year. The movie studio needs to stop making resident evil movies period. What more can I say besides  don't watch, rent or buy this lame movie.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|cheaper then any store i found it in my kids love this movie and watch it all the time makes a perfect gift or just a great addition to your family movie collection
B007JRU4N0|4.0|better than I thought it was going to be .Not the best entertainment but it kept me watching which isnt always easy.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Haven't been able to listen to anything else since I discovered this guy. Worth every penny & more. He's changing rap.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a must see series. Top notch acting with a lot of great content. The case it came in wasn't very well made, but certainly was creative.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|i wonder if i can have my money back?  what made the film even harder to stomach was the expectation, via critic reviews, that it was a good film
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|So far I have liked all of this developer's games. This one is no exception. My kids enjoy playing it with me because it is not too hard. Definitely worth buying!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a simple game with some nice customization options and a smooth, easy user interface. Doesn't take a ton of brain power to use so it's a good quick distraction when I have some time to kill.
1401937519|1.0|Want to read an exciting and inspirational book on near death experience?  Get &#34;Embraced By the Light&#34; by Betty Eadie.  Fantastic and quick read.<br /><br />I love Wayne Dyer...have a lot of his stuff, including the &#34;Wishes Fulfilled&#34; CD set that recommends this book...but I read it and found it very boring.  She goes on and on about things that are obvious.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I too am a writer,  and I feel that this book was an absolute page turner. I couldn't put the book down. I am truly looking forward to reading fifty shades freed. This book was tastefully done.
B002CAWNEM|4.0|This was a good movie that showed the acting talent of Beyonce. Her musical talents are already known but<br />this movie gave her a chance to display her acting and she did an excellent Job.  Ali Larter also did a good<br />job aqs well.
B002ZG999U|4.0|amaing cast all in one place even if only for some breif appearances<br /><br />a number of funny one liners, pretty basic macho guy stupid humor but hey this is exactly what I expected from this crew and of course i love it<br /><br />good explosions and visuals
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is exactly what my daughter wanted. She read all 3 books and loved the movie.<br />I would recommend this for families with older kids.
B008A1NKTO|4.0|more realistic<br /><br />not overblown good guys always win everything crap even if a few good guys do take down quite a lot of bad guys<br /><br />shows the perils, real price paid, and sense fo relentlessness that comes with pursuing the bad guys
B00005S6K8|5.0|I LOVE this movie! So good! I personally think it is better then the original.I like Linus' and Sabrina's romance so much better! So sweet! I would highly recommend this movie!
B0002WZTOI|4.0|great classic<br /><br />still great music<br /><br />good plot<br /><br />great scenes of fighter jets and excitement<br /><br />decent acting and a few memorable lines
0385507755|1.0|Great read if you like fiction but I found out, after I read the book, that he admitted it was total fiction. Since I don't like to read fiction, it was a waste of time and money for me
B000C20VPA|4.0|happy with the movie<br /><br />quality fo disk was good<br /><br />service was quick<br /><br />all star cast<br /><br />good visuals<br /><br />interesting plot and narrative
B001F6TXME|3.0|Serves its purpose but the cord is too short. They need to make this with a longer cord so that you can use it effectively.
B002413TY2|5.0|well one of my favorites<br /><br />good action, easy to follow plot, good visuals and a bit of humor<br /><br />fast delivery
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|So far, I like it but have 't really had time to learn much about how to play yet.  Had too many people here so hope to really get into it now. My granddaughter loves it.
B009DH379C|4.0|Great reprise of the essence of Queen at their best. The 35mm footage is special. A good trip down Memory Lane.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Have not opened the set yet but expect good things, providing a get a refund on the other two movie dvd I bought without knowing I had purchased it in this set.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Was allowed to only play to level thirteen. App automatically closes on its own. Will not let me play levels past thirteen.
B003QS9VYE|5.0|A simple journey through insanity, foster care, experimentation with drugs, and the journey of celebrity.<br /><br />In truth, an excellent children's film.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i the best game you can have it is easy to install. easy game on the go.if your bored in your car or not in your car it is fun too.watch the different colors when you win the game thats all i have to say about this GREAT GAME INSTALL IT WILL BE THE BEST THING YOU EVER DID GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very quick read with relatively well developed characters.  I found it very enjoyable light reading. A little racy but not downright smutty.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Having come off of several poor reading choices, this novella was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Like much of Sanderson's other material, this story surrounds the construction of an innovative magic system. I managed to read this story back-to-back with another story that approached the same task, but with remarkably less charisma. In my opinion, one must be very careful with magic system construction because all magic systems are innately breaking reality in some way and can draw excessive attention to themselves. The construction of the magic system is carried out to the benefit of characterization and, as such, the characters take the fore while the magic system supports their development. The length of the story is very comfortable for its scope and it does not lag excessively at any point.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|it's great to play if your new to angry birds or have small children. I picked this one for my son, but I prefer the star wars version.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|Great dancing music.  My grandkids love her so I'm listening to her more often than normally do that sound/type of music.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|it's the birds using the force to fight the dark side. great for anyone who loves the star wars trilogy.it's great how the movie is incorporated into the game. very entertaining
B001GM28HO|4.0|Just expericing her music.  My g-kids love dancing to her.  Went a head and bought cd because g-kids kept asking me to play it going down road.  Gosh forbid I not have their music.  Kids are 5:5 and 1.5 yrs old.  They love dancing to her.  Good beat.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|we Loved using amazon instant. the movie is epic. one should not judge the movie based on the other but view the series as a whole. in that way TDKR is a masterful end.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Good sound.  I'm to be honest just getting to know her music mostly because of grandkids...they love dancing to her video.  Wanted cd for car.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|bad piggies is good but it takes forever to download and there's a lot of adds. every level comes a add. every minute also.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I tried this on a friend's iPod and decided to buy it. I am somewhat dissapointed at Rovio for raising their prices and such, but the app is incredibly fun.
B0027VTMAE|1.0|Amazon is offering this blu ray with the full 133 minutes.  When I received the movie it says on the back that it is only 93 minutes-meaning that 40 minutes have been cut. I did not notice this until I started watching the movie and realized this was a comepletely different version.  Has anyone else had this problem? I returned it and left a message of the problem and they sent me another one wth the exact same problem!<br /><br />So I called and they are going to investigate it.  I already have the regular DVD and it has the 133 minute version but I love the movie so I wanted the blu ray clearity.<br /><br />So they are going to credit my account and I have to send this one back again.<br /><br />I guess it was not meant to be!  LOL
B004MYF4SS|3.0|Fast moving page turner set in a location that evokes the mystery of the Scottish isles. May keeps the pot boiling in grand fashion.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works without issues. Ads are only at the beginning of each game. I wish I could pay to opt out of ads.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I really enjoyed the game, not too hard and not too easy.  Certainly worth the cost. Look forward to more from them!
B005LAIGF0|3.0|I watched the extended cut.  I like movies shot in New York with New York actors and they all acquit themselves well.  I guess the title comes from the Hopkins poem Matthew Broderick reads to the class.  And how did she find out the name of the bus driver and where he lived?  Only in the movies.  Mark Ruffalo always delivers a fine performance.  I also liked the mother/daughter scenes.  Not always a bed of roses but the mother tried and both actresses played the scenes quite well. Paquin is always good but this is just an extension of her Frankie Adams in the TV adaptation of MEMBER OF THE WEDDING with Alfre Woodard.  Maybe I am too old for teen angst but I do recommend it for those who want to see the extended cut and for the fine performances.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I am only about one third thru the book but I can't put it down. It's all I hoped it would be!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Our family has movie night every Friday. When we saw this movie, we simply loved it and had to purchase it. This DVD was new and offered at a great price. Amazon has yet to  disappoint us.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and since I had seen the movie, thought it would make a good gift.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|My family loved this series. I especially love that the trilogy was offered at such a great price. The DVDs were in new condition. Great price!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for a family member that had requested it as he likes the Batman movies.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I enjoy such music and this was no disappointment.  I recommend Mumford and Sons to music lovers in the world.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was a wonderful read. Each character draws you further into the world of the circus. I really like the way the time line is arranged. The characters are quite interesting and deeply familiar. I would recommend this to anyone with imagination.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was a combination of everything I like in a good romance. The story was beautiful and how it was laid out was even better. This is simply a must read!!!
0802473156|5.0|Very satisfied with the product and customer service. I was also very impressed with the length of time that my product arrived.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|SINCE IT WAS FILMED IN THE NORTWEST(MONTANA) MAKES IT EVEN BETTER! MERYL STREEP FITS AND PLAYS THE PART PERFECT! GREAT ACTION ON THE RIVER!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Having seen Hugh Jackman perform live and hear Ann Hathaway sing also live at a reprise concert I was quite surprise of their casting to this classic which I saw open on Broadway......, However this falls short to what I remember as a real enjoyment and heart pulling as it was in the theater...... Eddie Redmayne as Marius was a good surprise...as well as Samantha Barks as Eponine.... however Amanda Seyfried as Cosette.... is no Judy Kuhn, and it is ashame that they did not find someone to voice over her..... hey they did it to Natalie Wood in west side story,,,,,,,,,, over all it is a nice highlight...wish it was more the feel of the power in One more day and not as weak..... like I said 5 bucks it find anymore....I would skip it....by the original cast and enjoy
0120884674|5.0|My wife wanted this for Christmas. She loves studying bones and is in school for it. Awesome book. Awesome price!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Since the latest upgrade, I'm not able to check-in or post anything but pictures.  Every time there is an upgrade, something else breaks in FB.  It has become very frustrating!!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I don't remember the original one, but this movie was better then expected. I wasn't going to get it because it was only given 3 stars, but this movie was definitely one of the best action movies I have seen in a while. A+++
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Love the Big Bang Theory!  So handy to have a couple of episodes downloaded on my kindle for when I travel
B008KOMMTA|5.0|This is a must for any fan of Titanic. I got it for a friend, but will get another one for me to keep it unopened. I have a feeling that this set will become a high price collector piece later in years. It comes with all of the formats and limited edition items. It's great!
B003SQVI54|5.0|The first couple of seasons were great but I wonder if the show is going to be as good as the originals after they took a break.
B00785P2QC|4.0|out of the world great job on all the details and perks. would recommend to all friends and family. too
B002N2SYAG|5.0|I really love having these episodes downloaded on my kindle for downtimes when I just want to pass some time.
0312117337|1.0|I understood that this would come with the complete set of tarot cards since it says (cards) but was dissapointed when it turns out to be only the book. I need the cards to go along with the book.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I travel a lot and appreciate the episodes to keep me interested on a long plane ride.  I will eventually have watched the entire season if I continue to travel at the rate that I do.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I bought for daughter for christmas. I watch movie it is one of the best of the twilight series. Great Quality picture.
B000KZFMZI|5.0|I have watched all of the Friends episodes and I love having all of the episodes handy at home to watch whenever I want to.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|While I have enjoyed most of Grisham's books, this one had me skipping lots of pages on my Kindle just to get through it or at least finally get to the point. Page after page of detail seemingly going nowhere was stupifying. In the author's notes, he says himself that he did little research for this book. The beginning is interesting as it details life in prison for the main character, a formerly successful attorney. It was moderately interesting throughout the middle of the book, but in my own opinion became tedious towards the end. While similar to The Firm in its finale, it lacked the plot and suspense. For someone new to Grisham's novels, this one might be okay.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is a very good movie.<br />You probably shouldn't get it unless you've seen the others, you'd be pretty confused.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Emily (Amanda) is getting Revenge for what happened to her father.  She is finding that, when you start out on the road to Revenge, you never know what the eventual cost will be to you.  So think carefully, before you do this.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I read this book, and loved it.  I'm publishing my first book and feel the information provided will shortcut the time to get noticed on Amazon.  I just wrote a book for Administrative office support called Learn, Earn, Advance, and I think I'm going to make it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is an amazing mystery and character study that keeps you off balance all the way through. The reader is never prepared for what happens next.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther is a good read. I love the John Corey series.<br />I enjoyed very much. Typical Nelson Demille book.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|So boring.  A young man, Lincoln, swings his axe to kill selected vampires.  Really really lame.  I like a good vampire flick, but this, well, does not qualify.  Buy it in the bargain bin.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I was misled by the positive reviews, expected a funny movie. Every single character in the movie is unidimensional. There isn't a single person you could describe as real. The plot is completely unoriginal. You have seen better incarnations of this movie a million times before. It's the old underdog team gets a new unorthodox member who ends up changing their approach and helping them win plot, done completely according to formula without any apparent effort by the director to inject an iota of originality. I kept waiting for a musical surprise that would warrant the rave reviews on amazon. No dice. Some of the actors can sing well but you would be much better off watching glee reruns. A complete waste of time. The only reason it gets two stars is that I assume I am not in the intended demographic, and kids in their late teens would probably enjoy it to some degree.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Well done movie about a classic fairytale, of course.  Good story, good acting, great effects.  I enjoyed it.  I recognized who I though was Ian McShane, but he was a small dwarf...on the credits, it was him, LOL.  Great evil baddies with a sad story behind them, and a glorious ending.  Enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game create worlds and try to survive creepers SO AWESOME so download this app FORSURE<br />and it is the best game of minecraft
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Batman films are just ok to me.  This one was well done.  But Ledger was FANTASTIC as the Joker.  Just another Batman movie.  Worth seeing.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I have to agree with some other reviewers that it is a fun game but at some point you are almost forced to buy points or you will be stuck. That is very disappointing especially as those points are really expensive.
B000I186FW|5.0|Brilliantly done movie.  I just love this flick.  You need to use your brain for this one.  Thought provoking and entrancing.  Love it!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|An excellent 2-hr. opera concert sung by four well-known artists.  Good aria selections from beloved operas.  I loved every minute of it.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I love a good scifi movie. This one did not disappoint.  Great story, and the overall movie was very well done.  Worth seeing.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|What a great concert! Speaking about memory lane!!! Brought back wonderful memories!! Worth purchasing!!!I plan on buying some as gifts to friends.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Started watching Game of Thrones on HBO and wanted to read the books..... not disappointed.A very good read and enjoyable.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|Ist always good to watch Brad Pitt in an excelent movie and spend the afternoon in front of the tv
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Love, love, love  this book, makes you look at life very differently.  I've started giving copies away to friends and family.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm so in love with this show especially evan peters ;) the story line is always great for both seasons can't wait for the next episode....
B00006FDCD|1.0|\\"It,\\" is perhaps Stephen King's greatest novel, riveting, horrifying, and thoroughly entertaining.  However, this awful production demonstrates the folly of taking a wonderful story and then destroying it with cheap made-for-TV production values, production, and direction.  None of the actors rings true to the characters in the book; the players are all out-of-work hasbeens or neverwases working with an extremely lame script that removes all the mature drama and horror from the plot.  The special effects aren't bad, but the clown is a bit silly (like something from a bad '80s MTV video)  Love the story, hate this movie to the extreme.  A really good Stephen King movie has yet to be made, and this sets a very low standard.  File under\\" \\"yuck!\\"
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I saw the first movie and decided that I had to read the books. So glad I did! They are fantastic :)
B001EYGOEM|5.0|excellent music I love the lyrics and the melody of the photographs are beautiful and my daughter is willing to come to Venezuela soon
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|As someone who is a huge Les Mis fan, it makes me sad to songs such as &#34;Lovely Ladies,&#34; &#34;Do You Hear The People Sing,&#34; and &#34;Little Fall of Rain&#34; not included on this album. Everything on the album is fantastic and I really just wish I could hear the rest of the show.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|excellent music I love the lyrics and the melody of the photographs are beautiful and my daughter is willing to come to Venezuela soon
0345803493|5.0|It seems my opinion of Fifty Shades Darker differs somewhat from many of the other reviewers. Taken as a whole (all three books) I believe EL James wove a page turner of a tale. The first book was a bit intense, but it did set up the characters for future development. I felt Fifty Shades Darker (book 2 in the series) was the best book of the three. There was much to say for the progression of the characters throughout all three books, but the storyline in Darker pushed the limits of the characters.<br /><br />While these books continue to do well in the bookstores, I have read several lackluster reviews about them. I have to say I disagree with most of the negative postings here that I've read. For a first time author, EL James wove a tale not just of erotica (which I could take or leave myself), but grew her characters and an intricate storyline with finesse throughout the three books. Naysayers May not like her writing style, but I found the stroy to be intriguing enough to read more than once. Yes, it's first person POV and very straightforward in style, but the story and characters make the books worth the read, even if you don't care for erotica. EL James deserves credit where credit is due. Cudoos for a finely fashioned tale with more than a little sexy content.
B008J34466|5.0|very good cd. The music is fantastic, and so this Grammy-nominated videos on TV are pretty good. IS EXCELLENT. THANKS
044042321X|5.0|Really enjoyed the Graphic Novel.  Detailed illustrations were wonderful.  Good adaptation.  Enjoyed that it was distinct from the HBO series depictions.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this app alot. does a great job showing percentages of battery life needed to do diffrent tasks. this app is very is very usefull. works great. money well spent.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this.  Loved having it on the Kindle, all my previous reads were paperbound versions.  On Kindle, was able to read it anywhere, including while at work walking down the hall between meetings.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I like it and I am sending Christmas cards once I make them on this. (using text plus which is an app I highly recomend)
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I picked up this as filler for an order having watched it in the theaters.  It's a great movie and is really funny!
1449410243|1.0|I was really excited about this book because I've seen some of the Oatmeal's cat cartoons and they are SO funny!  Unfortunately it seems that he picked the WORST cartoons ever to put into this book.  Other than a few funny ones in the front of the book, which you can see all over facebook, the remaining 80% of the book was boring and, at times, downright offensive.  What a HUGE disappointment.  I strongly recommend you read this book in the bookstore or library before buying so you won't be disappointed too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game to pass a little time with. I would recommend it to any one. It is actually what it says it is.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Thought the story is simple, its second to the action and the interactions that the characters have. Though, I think some characters were a bit left out. Hulk and Thor seemed to take a backseat to Iron Man and Capt. America.
1419705849|4.0|Well, it was very well made.  But it was still not the best of the Wimpy Kid series.  (The best was book 4, Dog Days.)  Jeff Kinney should have cut out some of the romance.  Just scratch out what I said.  IT IS A MUST READ!
B001NT057K|5.0|This is such a classic...can't believe it was not in my music library.....so not it is!!  Love it when I first saw the movie, and ;heard the soundtrack......still love it today!!
B009A9EPLM|4.0|I have always liked the music of John Williams This well written and wonderfully performed by arguably the best orchestra in the world, the Chicago Symphony. The music is a bit somber as fits the mood of the film. however with that consideration in mind, I enjoyed this soundtrack.
B009YJEKJK|4.0|Like the cd, but disappointed that Amazon didn't list the duet artists on the playlist...btw iTunes does.  The tunes are sweet and well done.  I really enjoyed it!!
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Classic movie in blu-ray and DVD, it doesn't get much better! Also includes some great information on special features, a must have!
B004SEUJVO|5.0|One of my fave movies of all time. The cast is topnotch definitely. Amazing how the director was able to gather these young actors right before they all became major superstars. Major kudos!
0763627410|5.0|We are almost finished with the picture book stage for our kids and in reviewing all of our books over many years, this one vies for the best one. The illustrations are colorful and creative. The poetry flows nicely and does not get tired after what has been, for us, probably a few hundred cumulative readings. The story has a heartwarming ending and there are probably some substantive educational positives (counting, adjectives) but it is, above all, a book that makes reading together fun.
0307719219|1.0|Interesting theory and almost certainly right, but the book was one eyed, patronizing, repetitive. I lost interest half way through. As in far too many business and economics books, a good idea that would have made a great article is stretched beyond breaking point to a book, and it shows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|very fun but kinds hard in survival 7.00$ is a bit much and when does the nawhal bacon redditors only
B0097JYVAU|4.0|Well argued, thought provoking. Excellent overview on the practical application of statistics, brought to life with case studies from poker
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|There's no doubt that Ellie Goulding has a beautiful voice. Some of the songs here have a Florence and the Machine feel, kind of moody and ethereal. Others are more pop driven, with Ellie's voice sounding more playful. The standout for me is Explosions. Ellie's voice oozes emotion in that one, and the lyrics are especially powerful.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really thought that this would be a quick boring read, one man alone on Mars, but I was pleasantly surprised. EXCELLENT writing, interesting and engaging, believable characters, plausible science, really keeps your interest throughout the novel. HIGHLY recommend.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Can't wait to watch this, amazing price on black friday. I heard it was amazing on TV.  Looking forward to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition is soooo fun. I cant get Pc so kindle fire pe is a savior of mine. thx amazon
B00992CF6W|3.0|I loved this game I have had it for almost a year. then when I logged on today all my hard work was gone I checked everywhere and all my hard work went like spoof pls fix this then I will rate 5 stars
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This was a sweet movie with likable characters and a lovely Christmas message. It did focus a bit much on gift-giving but was unique in their approach to the Santa story.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  I play with my husband and with friends that are far away.  It is a nice way to keep in touch.
B002VPE1XE|2.0|This case is way to big for the modern, small point and shoot cameras.  It is, however, to small for a camera with any type of lens.
