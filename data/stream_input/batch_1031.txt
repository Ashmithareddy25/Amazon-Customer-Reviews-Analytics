B003JTHETY|5.0|This is yet another in a long string of great albums by Maiden. Since Bruce and Adrian came back a decade ago with Brave New World, it has definitely been a different band than the Maiden of the 80's and 90's and well it should be. The band has matured and really mastered their craft.     The fact that people are complaining because it doesn't sound like NOTB is merely reflective of their personal inability to grow. These people should take their spandex, knee high white socks with colored stripes on the outside, head and wrist bass & go bust out a VHS copy of Live After Death and rock out on their 20\\" tv. Does anyone really want to her the same 10 songs for 20 years straight but these people?    This one should be listened to the old fashioned way, sit back and relax with some good earphones or a good sound system, break out the booklet and read along to each song.     Sure it's different, that's why it's so great!  It takes Maiden to another level and the ride there is amazing.
B001E0DW5A|2.0|Maybe Hannah's writing improves in her later books. This one reads more like a TV script than a tightly crafted novel. The premise is interesting, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. There are so many better writers out there. She doesn't hold a candle to Karin Fossum, Tana French, or Laura Lippmann, just to name a few.
1416589473|5.0|It's not often that I get hooked on a story, wanting to know what happens next. Matt Forbeck's \\"Ghosts of Ascalon\\" is one of those stories. Many chapters end in a cliff-hanger, making it difficult not to go on to the next. The characters seem to be portrayed as somewhat stereotypical of their respective races, but that's one of the things that makes the book entertaining. In the beginning there were a few characters I found a bit annoying, but grew to like by the book's end. Forbeck does an excellent job of character development, making the reader actually care about what happens to them. Add to that the surprises tossed in here and there and you have a good story. After finishing the book, I thought it'd even make a good movie.    \\"Ghosts of Ascalon\\" takes place a year before the Guild Wars 2 MMO begins (GW2 takes place 250 years after the original GW, I believe) and serves as an excellent primer on the GW2 world and its current events. So if you have any interest in GW2, whether a current GW player or having just heard of it, this book is especially recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|one of the best i`ve read.collins is a true mastermind. katniss is a truely intriguing protagonist (main character).i would recommend this book to all my friends
B003J27WFW|5.0|Both DVD's are great. Make sure you watch both. I understand the band personalities much more now. It covers from the very first high school gig thru and after Peart's family loss and the band reuniting.  If you like RUSH, you really NEED to watch this.
B000062XFG|4.0|The second season is MUCH better than the first.  Better writing, stories, special effects.
B00005JNJV|3.0|I don't really get the rave reviews here, and from some critics. (Maybe it's a demographic thing? I am a 40-year-old male college grad, with no Batman product experience in the last 15 years, although I have seen a lot of other TV/movies.) So I am adding this review for any potential viewers that are like me to consider.<br /><br />This was a decent action movie, not as good as Spiderman 2. I did love their basic idea of explaining how Batman and all his props and methods came to be. Some of the acting was subpar, although Christian Bale was OK. The fight scenes could have been easier to follow. The main problem as often happens for me, is the story. It seemed like a bunch of scenes from other movies strung together, and I kept having this feeling that things were just too convenient and/or weren't making logical sense. There were occasional good effects, or surprising twists in scenes, but too often they were just ho-hum.<br /><br />By the way, the widescreen version Amazon is selling for $5.95 at this time comes with literally one minute of bonus features (for those who care about such things!)
B002NXSRX4|1.0|One of the worst movies of ALL time.  Do NOT spend money on this drivel, if anything call up the idiots in Hollywood and demand them to pay you for wasting more than a second of your life on this.  AND ALSO - since when is Government Issue Joe an international force, \\"GI Joe ... the AMERICAN HERO\\"??
0375842209|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  The writing style, the story...everything!  I was so attached to the characters that I didn't want it to end.  Now I'm struggling to find something new to read as The Book Thief is a hard act to follow!
0385339100|3.0|I liked the book all the way until the last 5-10 pages. The ending left me totally disappointed..I wanted to yell at Grisham for ruining an otherwise good book with his ending..It took an enjoyable read and soured it quite a bit. The other parts of the book are well thought out and keeps your attention so that was entertaining, but it was ruined for me by the end. and after all the end is your lasting impression of any book. so my lasting impression is one of disappointment.<br />I still think his earlier stuff (A Time to Kill, The Pelican Brief, The Firm and The Client) are his best stuff. If you haven't read any of those (and there are not alot of people who haven't) I highly recommend you purchase those first.<br /><br />And books by Ken Follet are also very good especially (A Dangerous Fortune & Pillars of the Earth)
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Okay, first I am an absolute fan of the book series, being a teen myself, I toatally relate to the characters. I draw fan-art on the series, that's how much I love it.    *SOME SPOILERS*    Good points:  -Good graphics  -okay plot  -Acting is good  -Funny, hip, movie aimed for teens    Bad points:  -Loss of background, like Nancy Bobofit(Yancey Acadamy)and the first time he uses his powers.  -The ages of the actors, book describes them as 12, in the movie they are like 14-15  -Character flaws- Grover is sopposed to be timid, not confident and joke-cracking (MAJOR let down), Annabeth has ALOT more envolvment in the story then the movie depicts, they captured Percy pretty well.  -Leaving out characters- Examples- Clarrise, Dionysus, Ares,etc.    All in all it's okay, something I would definitly add to movie collection, but don't get your hopes up too much.
B00002430K|1.0|This CD never worked for me. I purchased it to replace my Believe CD (which I played to death). I tried to play it on several CD players including my computer and still nothing. The worst part is that when I sent it back to Amazon they never sent me another one to replace it. I received an E-mail stating that they were out of stock even though the stock numbers were up on their web site for this particular item. On top of that I was never reimbursed for the money I spent for that CD. As far as the music on this track goes...THE MUSIC IS GREAT. I believe that this track is one of Cher's best!
B003QCCS36|5.0|If you are a Ray Lamontagne fan this is best yet. He proves his genious of song writing and his ability to make every new album a suprise by mixing genres to create a masterpiece. I have over 2000 cds and I can honestly say this is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

B000BT97AY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and it was a good source of entertainment on my latest trip.  It is kind of creepy and out there but that is so my style.  Mirrormask is about a girl who is unhappy with her world and then has to fight for it when she is replaced in it.
B003QCCS36|5.0|A recording has to be something truley remarkable for me to take the time to actully try and put forth the effort to write a review on it. There just hasn't been anything inspiring and worth writing about in a long time.<br />And I don't think I've given a recording 5 stars since, well since Ray's first release \\"Trouble\\".<br />Good Willing & the Creek Don't Rise has been in constant rotation on my ipod since I snatched up the Amazon digital download for a mere $3.99 last Tuesday, easily the best music deal I've picked up in a long time!<br />In fact I love it so much I'll be heading out later today to buy the \\"hard copy\\" cd from my local Newbury Comics.<br /><br />Ray's latest will most likely never reach the legendary status of Dylan's \\"Nashville Skyline\\" or Neil Young's \\"Harvest\\", recordings where the similarities are unmistakable (espcially with \\"Skyline\\") - which is unfortunate because in many ways it's much more than either of those two recordings. The muscianship on \\"God Willin'.....\\" is everything and more as that on Nashville Skyline, and the songwriting and singing surpasses that of both.<br />I suppose another similarity with these artist is their singing, with all three of them people seem to either love it or hate it without much middle ground. Ray's voice however, especially on this recording, fits perfectly into the music surrounding it.<br />And then there's the music. Unlike a lot of his previous stuff, this recording puts the band and the music where it belongs, right up fron with Ray's remarkable voice and song writing. Obviously he pays them their due by giving \\"the Pariah Dogs\\" equal billing on the front cover.<br />Starting with the funky bluesy Repo Man, the recording takes you through a variety of different musical styles and themes.<br />Some of the standouts are the melancholy \\"New York City's Killing Me\\", a song about feeling trapped in the big city and the need to escape and find peace in a simpler, less busy place.<br />The title track with it's beautiful steel guitar flowing throughout the song is probably where I most draw the reference to \\"Nashville Skyline\\", a song that could well be written from the perspective of a man from an earlier time (the 1800s), forced to be away from his love, hope remains inside him that they'll soon be reunited.<br />\\"Beg Steal or Borrow\\", a song about a young man dreaming of breaking out of the small town and avoiding the pitfalls others around him have fallen into, is to me what I imagine Ray probably saw a lot of in the Maine milltown he walked away from when he made his move and started writing songs and playing music.<br />\\"Are We Really Through\\" has such a beautiful guitar melody playing behind Ray's pain filled voice reminds me so much of another of my favorite songs that I can't for the life of me recall.<br />Heck, as I'm writing this and listening to the music I'm realizing every song on this recording is a standout.<br />This isn't only one of the best recordings of the year, it's one of the best recordings of all time.<br /><br />I honestly haven't done a lot of digging around about this recording, but I was just on Ray's website and chuckled when I saw the photo of the band and lo and behond if Ray ain't the spittin' image of Dyan on the cover of \\"Nashville Skyline\\", same dress, same hat. Perhaps there's more to the comparison between the two recordings that I realized.<br /><br />So do yourselves a favor and go out and purchase a copy of this cd, plug it in, sit yourself down on your back porch rocker (or anywhere quiet and peaceful) and be swallowed up in the beauty of it all.hroughout the song is probably where I most draw the reference to \\"Nashville Skyline\\", a song that could well be written from the perspective of a man from an earlier time (the 1800s), forced to be away from his love, hope remains inside him that they'll soon be reunited.  \\"Beg Steal or Borrow\\", a song about a young man dreaming of breaking out of the small town and avoiding the pitfalls others around him have fallen into, is to me what I imagine Ray probably saw a lot of in the Maine milltown he walked away from when he made his move and started writing songs and playing music.  \\"Are We Really Through\\" has such a beautiful guitar melody playing behind Ray's pain filled voice reminds me so much of another of my favorite songs that I can't for the life of me recall.

B001TOD92C|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is a no-holds-barred story about life in and out of the ring. A powerful story that transcends the sports entertainment and makes a powerful commentary about relationships and the human condition, The Wrestler is one of the great films of the 21st century.<br /><br />The Wrestler tells the story of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson a wrestling superstar in the 1980's. Twenty years later, he's a middle-aged man living out of a trailer in New Jersey and working at a supermarket packing boxes on weekdays and independent wrestling shows at V.F.W halls on the weekends. His life is a sad, lonely existence and outside of wrestling he has very little connection to anyone save for Cassidy, an aging stripper he's trying to court. His existence is working and scraping up enough money to pay his rent, tanning sessions, and steroids to maintain his wrestling career, working towards a participating in a match celebrating the 20th Anniversary between him and the Ayatollah, now a used car salesman. He's doing okay until a brutal hardcore match with Necro Butcher. In the aftermath of that match, Randy suffers a heart attack that changes his life.<br /><br />Years of wear and tear in the ring and drug abuse have caught up with Randy. Told by his doctor he can no longer wrestle, he must figure out a new way to make a life. After begging his surly boss (a powerful contrast from the supportive wrestling promoters who beg him for work), He works at the deli counter at the Supermarket. It's a painful and powerful contrasting visual as he makes his entrance into the Supermarket deli counter, one that symbolizes Randy's entrance into the real world.<br /><br />Taking Cassidy's advice and tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie. His efforts are rebuffed at first by Stephanie, but she does re-establish her connection with her father and promises to have dinner with her. However, when Cassidy rejects his advances and an opportunity at a serious relationship that night, Randy's world falls apart. Feeling lonely and hurt, Randy goes to a wrestling show to reconnect with wrestlers and wrestling fans, the only people he feels care about him, has and wild night with a female fan. As he returns home and falls asleep, he misses his dinner with Stephanie and she cuts him out of his life permanently. Recognized by a fan at the Deli counter and belittled by his boss, Randy not only quits his job, but gives up on life as well.<br /><br />Rejected by the real world and the real people closest to him, a despondent Randy decides to return to the only place he feels he's loved: The ring. He books the match with the Ayatollah for no pay because it's the only thing he has to live for.<br /><br />A man with nothing to lose and no connection to anyone or anything, Randy goes on to his final match with the Ayatollah. While Cassidy makes one last effort to reconnect Randy to the real world, he brushes her off. A hopeless and despondent Randy goes on to perform his last match with the Ayatollah. As the screen cuts to black before he comes off the top rope for the Ram Jam, the audience is left pondering if this is his last match or his last day living.<br /><br />The Wrestler is a classic. I love the storytelling in this film; it gives us a brilliant insight into the wrestling business and how wrestling matches work. The writing in this film is reminiscent of Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling's early work, a social commentary about the human condition wrapped up in an entertaining story. Randy the Ram Robinson isn't just wrestling in the ring, he's a man wrestling with his own mortality and maintaining his connection to a world that has forgotten him. Outside of the ring he's a lost soul; we see how much the world that has passed him by in the scene where he's playing Nintendo with a young boy who talks about Call of Duty 4. It's like his entire world ended in 1985, from his clothes to the beat-up Dodge Ram Van he drives, he's a relic fromanother era trying to understand a world and people that have changed while he was grappling in the ring.<br /><br />Director Darren Aronofsky's crafts a cinematic masterpiece filled with beautiful, moving visuals. Utilizing a pseudo-documentary style, Aronofsky's visuals give Randy's story grit, texture and a sense of realism. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie, I felt like I was watching real life transpiring in front of me. There are some shots that are incredibly powerful; the scenes with the old wrestlers at the convention in wheelchairs is one of the most moving pieces of film I've seen in years. We take for granted how much these athletes entertain us, and take no mind to what happens to them when they leave the ring.<br /><br />The acting here is some of the best I've seen. Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his career in The Wrestler. This is Rourke's signature role, the one he will be known for generations to come. I feel he was ROBBED of an Oscar; Sean Penn needs to pack that statue and Fed Ex it to Rourke NOW. Onscreen Rourke disappears and becomes Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. Evan Rachel Wood steals scenes as Rourke's Daughter Stephanie. Her emotions are so powerful in this film; I could feel her pain and hurt coming off the screen. I'm also wondering why she wasn't nominated for supporting actress Oscar; she was perfect in this film. Marisa Tomei is moving as Cassidy, she adds a graceful humanity to her character making us see the hardworking woman trying to make a living to take care of her family. Todd Barry Gives a solid supporting role As Wayne, the prickly supermarket manager.<br /><br />The Wrestler is Shawn James Five-Star Essential DVD.

B000068OCS|2.0|Koyaanisqatsi made an artsy splash when it came out in 1983, but for reasons now lost I couldn't make it to a showing.  Twenty seven years later I finally got my wish.    I wanted to like Koyaanisqatsi, but was forced to realize it hasn't aged well. Godfrey Reggio shows a very good eye for dramatic shots, but then works them to exhaustion.  The time lapse scenes of people scurrying around like harried ants grew wearisome after two minutes, let alone ten.  The movie's metaphor of modern life as a hotdog highway, with people as the hotdogs, was soon made abundantly clear, but Reggio seems uncertain of his audiences' intelligence and just pounds this thought into their collective skull.    Likewise, Phillip Glass's score became an exercise in repetition that eventually began to grate on my ears.  To be fair Glass captures the atmosphere of the movie and the repetition in the score is a faithful reflection of the cinematography. Given the singularity of Reggio's vision he had no other option.    Koyaanisqatsi would have been great as a fifteen minute short subject; but like having a guest who overstays his welcome, I was relieved when it was over.
B000U91OII|3.0|The fan is indeed very quiet and does work as claimed.  But... the 2pin connector that it's shipped with is slightly larger than most of the 2pin connectors used in external cases / electronic equipment. Also I was expecting these fans to have ball bearings, but the ones shipped actually have lower quality sleave bearings.    The product info section could really do with some additional data.  - Specifying what type of bearing the fan has would have been a good start and also the size or pitch of the connectors.
0439023483|5.0|This book is shocking, intriguing and different. It's a good book that keeps you interested. There's a point to everything, everyone at all points. Never a dull moment. Great read :)
B0025KVLS8|5.0|For all the cynics that swore they were flukes here they give the world the Beatlemania Bible. Talent with tons of fun to boot, everyone wanted to be one the boys in the band. We all know these songs by heart. My only regret as a kid was that we were stuck with the United Artists album with 7 songs and soundtrack filler. Their confidence is evident down to the last track - I'll be back - and they came back even stronger. Move over Sinatra and Elvis - theses guys could do it better and do it all.
0525423842|5.0|I purchased this book as a quick summer read. I teach middle school, and wanted to try something I could recommend to students. I thought this was a great book.  Some of the critical remarks being made about it are what endears it to me. It does smack a bit of Encyclopedia Brown, and I loved those books.  They got me through many summers as a kid, and helped teach me the value of background or content knowledge, although I didn't realize that at the time. It does read a bit like an older generation of kid's literature, Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, etc. Again, why is this a bad thing? I loved those too! Not every book for teens needs to be Gossip Girl or Twilight. This book even reminded me a bit of the Harry Potter novels, without the magic. Theo is a good problem solver, wants to fight for what is right, and can be willing to bend the rules to achieve a positive goal. I shared it with my parents, who sent it to my nephew. I have even recommended it for a friend's book club, and am considering it for an Honor's reading class for my middle schoolers. This book is very current, addresses topics that effect students in my classroom, i.e. divorce, immigration issues, home foreclosures,computer technology, even crushes. I really look forward to the next novel.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|My husband and I are totally addicted to this series. It is fantastic.     What's nice about getting the dvd's at home is that you get the special features and get to see Alison Dubois and Joe Dubois in person. It seems the series has been closely based on them and it makes it even more real.     It is very interseting seeing the earlier series as we started watching it on TV - in the latter ones. You can see the structure of Alison and Joes relationship change and how they grow with it all. And seeing the kids when they are little is quite interesting. You also get to see Lee at his rawest and the introduction of Lynn - who was a Texas Ranger in the Pilot series. Manny hasn't changed majorly but I like that, as he is a great character. It is fascinating to see how Alison gets her information and how aometimes it's literal and sometimes it's metaphor or she doesn't get all of it at once and then gets another clue later type thing. It must be very frustrating at times for everyone. But what a great gift too.     All in all, I just love that mediumship and talking to people on the other side, is becoming so much more mainstream.     Just a fantastic series that is made even better because it is based on a real life person and her and her families experiences. What is even better for me in this series, is that the characters are so REAL. Neither Alison nor Joe as glammy stick thin, every hair in place people. Their kids are not all angelic and perfect - they are pretty real versions of kids on the whole. Alison and Joe have their good days, their bad days like everyone else, they fight, they make up, they disagree, they get cranky, they have moral dilemmas, they don't always agree with one another - it's SO real. It's refreshing to seeo on a TV series. We love it!!!     I highly recommend this series. Brilliant!
0321344758|4.0|If you're looking for a fast read on Web Usability, this is a great book.  Krug provides great examples and makes the subject fun.  Some of it is a tad dated, as I believe it was written in 2005.  I assume a 3rd edition will include more recent examples and delve into social media sites, etc.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield (2008) was a good sci-fi flick that I rated at four stars.  The animation work was very good including the creature effects. Especially good was that this creature design was unique and constantly morphing from one geometry to another, while the spirit of the design remained a deadly constant. Very frightening and well done.

1594488843|3.0|It's an ok book with good theories on motivation. However, it follows a sort of professorial style that I found boring and made it feel more like a school textbook. It would have been more enjoyable had it had more anecdotes to deliver its message. The best parts about the author's style are two folds: one, he had a list of recommended readings sections with book titles and a short synapses about them; two, it summarized all the chapters in the end of the book with a paragraph for each chapter. I wish other books did that!    For more reviews visit [...]
B003JTHESA|4.0|First off, I won't compare this cd to 80's-era Maiden because there is no comparison. When ranked among modern-era Maiden, I would put this below \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\", but FAR ABOVE the mediocre \\"Dance of Death\\". On First Listen, I immediately liked \\"The Final Frontier\\" (minus the meandering intro \\"Satellite 13\\"), \\"El Dorado\\", \\"Coming Home\\", and \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\". I have since grown to Love \\"Isle of Avalon\\". Other good songs include \\"The Alchemist\\" and \\"Starblind\\". The remaining songs are filler. The band sounds tight, the solos rock, Smith's song-writing influence is strong on the album... there'e a lot to like here. On the downside, the mix is muddy-sounding on some songs, Bruce's vocals sound a little rough, and the long intros and outros have got to go. This cd definitley grows on you. I wish Maiden could get a different Producer, though. I know Martin Birch's sound won't ever be duplicated, but there needs to be an outside influence to trim these songs down to the best parts and improve the sound quality ( I've gradually gotten used to Gers, but are 3 guitars really necessary?)Rick Rubin could make Maiden's final albums timeless! I recommend this to anyone who enjoy's modern Maiden music.
B003F3NE1Q|4.0|I've been a follower of this show since the very beginning, and it's definitely had its ups and downs. Seasons 4 and 5 weren't my favourites, but Season 6 was MUCH more like the Grey's I'd come to know and love. I actually cared about what was happening. Can't wait for next year!
1423101472|5.0|Riordan really outdid himself! The book is one big action sequence. Its fast paced, nonstop, and the definition of a \\"page turner.\\" Completely impressed with how he could continue such a long battle scene and find new excitement for each chapter. Everything from the previous books seem to come together in this one. I've always thought of Hades as the Severus Snape of the series, and he did show more redeeming qualities in this book. More of the demigod heroes really shown in this book. Lots of great ideas to think about regarding hope, friendship, and love. The storyline of Silena and Charlie was touching and very Greek mythological stories in the way it came together.  Of course, through it all, Riordan masterfully laces in his original humor! Perfect conclusion to the series and wonderfully executed. The only thing I was dissapointed in was Ethan's character. He seemed a little inconsistent. I think his character should have been given a little more pen time. There was also a lot of hinting at the curse of Achille's, but nothing ever became of the multiple warnings.  All in all, this book is one of the best final chapters to a series that I have read in a long time.  The ending was not \\"ride-off-into-the-sunset\\" perfect, but its fantastic as is.  Riordan really knows his mythology and knows how to revisuale it and make it relevant to today.  Great quotes too!<br /><br />(Annabeth, Percy, and Grover travel up in an elevator.) Grover: \\"Well... sure good to be together again.  Arguing.  Almost dying.  Abject terror.  Oh, look.  Its our floor.\\"
B0036TGSR6|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  I was disappointed in 'The Ghost Writer' since Roman Polanski did such a fine job with the excellent Holocaust drama, 'The Pianist'. What could have possessed Polanski to choose his material from 'The Ghost', a cheap shot novel from hack writer Robert Harris? The answer is obvious: Polanski has a grudge against the United States since they barred him from returning after he was accused of raping an underage girl back in the 70s.<br /><br />  'The Ghost Writer' starts off rather nicely. A car on a ferry remains unclaimed after all the other cars have driven off. We soon find out that the car belonged to Mike McAra, a long-term assistant of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). Mike is found dead, washed up on Martha's Vineyard beach where Lang has been vacationing with his wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams). Lang's assistant was helping him write his memoirs and now Lang's publishing company must hire a ghost writer to help the former Prime Minister complete the manuscript.<br /><br />  The ghost writer (who remains unnamed throughout the movie and is referred to as 'The Ghost') is played by Ewan McGregor who arrives on Martha's Vineyard in the midst of a burgeoning scandal. It seems that the International Court at the Hague has accused Lang of ordering the torture of suspected terrorists while he was in office. Novelist Harris failed to do his research regarding legal protocol/regulations at the Hague. According to Wikipedia, \\"handing British citizens over to the CIA to be tortured (in one case to death) -- would probably not be deemed a war crime or a crime against humanity by the International Criminal Court, as the acts were not \\"committed as part of a policy that is executed on a wide scale\\". In the DVD commentary, Harris admits he got the torture idea from watching a news report. Is this really the most original and clever idea that could have been utilized to propel the story along?<br /><br />  While Harris admits that Lang has some attributes of the real-life Tony Blair, he denies that his character is supposed to be a model for the former Prime Minister. Whether he's the model or not, one thing remains clear: both Harris and Polanski blame Blair for his association with George Bush, who is linked to accusations of torture of prisoners. To my mind, I always thought that Tony Blair was a liberal/progressive, but the association with Bush not only sullies his reputation in the eyes of these militant left-wingers, but turns him into some kind of war criminal. At least Harris/Polanski allow their Blair stand-in, Lang, to defend himself from the outrageous implication that he is a war criminal but the subsequent turns in the plot point to where their true sympathies lie.<br /><br />  McGregor's ghostwriter begins uncovering clues, possibly left by Lang's predecessor in the manuscript itself, that Lang is linked to the CIA. It appears that the CIA already is aware that there is some kind of secret code in the book, but they're either watching the ghostwriter to make sure he doesn't figure it out or allowing him to uncover the code for them. That's why so many unlikely events occur: Mike's room remains uncleaned and not searched and the Ghost finds some pictures of Lang from his days at Cambridge in the 70s, leading to clues that he may be associated with the CIA; The Ghost so easily finds his way to Emmet's house as the GPS is still programmed in the car; The Ghost so easily escapes from the clutches of two men who have been following in a car; and the assassin so easily is able to assassinate Lang despite the security protection (the implication is that the CIA makes a deal with the bitter father, who blames Lang for his son's death, allowing him access to the terminal roof).<br /><br />  Perhaps the weakest part of 'The Ghost Writer' is the idea that the Ghost uncovers Emmet's association with the CIA merely by googling him on the internet. Big secret! Andthen there's the ridiculous finale where Amelia informs the Ghost, echoing opposition leader Rycart's earlier revelation, that \\"it's all there at the beginning\\". The Ghost figures it out that Lady MacBeth-like 'Ruth' is a CIA agent and has been influencing her husband for years. It turns out Lang is merely a 'patsy' and initially doesn't accept Mike's warning that Ruth has been up no good. Later, the Ghost reveals to Lang on the plane that Mike betrayed him, by telling Rycart about Ruth.<br /><br />  The idiotic belief that the CIA uniformly consists of a bunch of cold-blooded murderers is reflective of the anti-American attitude in Europe today. Accusations of conspiracies are thick in the air despite no proof whatsoever. And here in 'The Ghost Writer', the CIA, in the form of a Machiavellian woman, will stoop to murder at any cost. If you are unable to refrain from bashing the CIA, it might be better to view them not as sinister characters, but more as a bunch of ineffectual bureaucrats, whose main source of 'intelligence', is what they can garner (along with anyone else) from the internet.<br /><br />  Due to the prohibition of Polanski being allowed back in the U.S., most of the exterior shots were filmed in Germany. Polanski manages to extract some decent performances from his actors (although Kim Cattall's so-called British accent, has some rough patches). The problem with 'The Ghost Writer' is not in its characters or even its smart dialogue. Rather, it suffers from an incredible and ludicrous plot coupled with that anti-American sensibility. Behind it all is a naive Utopian presumption that we can all get along despite the presence of international terrorism--that is, a group of people who are bent on destroying all those who don't conform to their radical, fanatical ideology.e where Amelia informs the Ghost, echoing opposition leader Rycart's earlier revelation, that \\"it's all there at the beginning\\".

0198326769|3.0|Some readers have complained--correctly--about the lack of historical accuracy in the text. The book probably would have worked better had the camp portrayed been a fictional one and not one we know so many horrifying facts about. This approach does seem to lessen the horror we should feel when we hear the word \\"Auschwitz\\" (and it is true that \\"with\\" in German is \\"mit\\" so OUT-WITH would make no sense to a German kid). That is a definite problem.<br /><br />On the other hand, I see the construction of the childlike words and the ending as totally symbolic--Bruno is a kind of blood-sacrifice, an innocent given both as an atonement and a punishment to the evil doers. Does his father become transformed by what happened? Does the reader? Does history? A similar ending makes \\"The Giver,\\" a YA scifi about a totalitarian society by Lois Lowry, work well--the main character is lost to a society he barely comprehends in a totally symbolic way, like a scapegoat. So I would say the literary effect outweighs the historical failings.<br /><br />As far as the child's naivete, yes, it is hard to accept, but again it is symbolic. The book is supposed to be considered in the abstract, not as hard realism. Some have mentioned MAUS. Do you really think Nazis were talking cats and the Jews were giant mice? That's symbolism.<br /><br />My mother was a small child during WWII in Germany and she often told us that regular people had little idea about what was going on--they saw scary things but suppressed them, as traumatized children (and even older people) will do. However, she certainly knew what Jews and Fuhrers were. Now, this kid's parents were active Nazis and they would surely have tried to brainwash him. Readers are right to have mixed feelings about that part of the book, but the story wouldn't work unless the kid is totally sheltered. Again, symbolic.<br /><br />For those readers who think this is tough subject matter and is disturbing, YES, that is the point. It should disturb you. Young people NEED to be taught about this stuff. Otherwise you hear stories like the one about the idiot high schoolers who laughed out loud during a screening of Schindler's List. What did they think they were watching? Herds of sociopaths are still among us today.<br /><br />Finally, the ending is not cheap and melodramatic at all, but powerful and symbolic. Despite the historical innaccuracy, which I spotted right away, I am not ashamed to say I cried: not just for the characters, but for the millions of lost souls and for humanity itself. Not many books can accomplish that, and so I say bravo to the author.ught about this stuff.

B003JTHESA|5.0|I've probably listened to this album over 10 times this past week and it still gets better with every listen. After that many listens to most albums by any other group I would normally be bored of it by than, but not the case here. The music here is so deep and there are so many layers to dig through I keep hearing new things every time. This album more than any other in the reunion era of Maiden makes the most out of the 3 guitar lineup. This album has some great melodies and once again Bruce puts in an amazing performance on vocals. I don't know how these guys keep doing it even in their mid 50's. It just blows my mind. Still too early to put it into perspective, but I think it's safe to say that this to me is one of their top 5 albums ever.

1904920209|4.0|I have this book and \\"Crust\\" also by Bertinet and together they offer a somewhat unique, but effective, teaching method for making homemade breads.  \\"Dough\\", the first book, is the one being reviewed but my comments also apply to \\"Crust\\" as the two books are essentially volume 1 & 2 of a bread making course.<br /><br />Bertinet hails from Brittany and his northern French upbringing is evident throughout.  He makes bread the way it's made in small French villages where the English influence predominates.  The included short DVD's guide the reader through the basic mixing and kneading process that is somewhat different from the typical  method employed in most bread books.  Is it better?  I don't think so, but it is another way of achieving the desired result and his demonstrations take place in a home (albeit, well equipped) kitchen rather than a commercial bakery or video production set so it's very reassuring to the novice.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are good, but not great.  And, like just about all bread making books they include a large percentage of breads that you probably won't ever make.  I mean, let's face it, most home bakers want to make VERY GOOD baguettes/round loaves, a sourdough or two, good rye, some Italian loaves and a good pizza dough.  Bertinet includes these along with numerous other breads and shapes, but then so does just about every other bread book out there.  What makes these books valuable is the visual hands on experience one gets from the DVD's.<br /><br />If you've never made bread (successfully) before these books would be a  very good instructional tool and (with the included DVD's) worth the $50 they will run you.  If you're a little more experienced I would HIGHLY recommend Maggie Glezer's \\"Artisan Baking\\".  It's only available in paperback and there's no DVD's, but the content and photography is excellent.  I would also recommend the chapter on bread in Julia Child's \\"The Way to Cook\\" as a excellent introduction to \\"french bread\\" making.  It's also probably the best all around cook book you can buy.

He has been fascinated with it the whole time; we \\"read\\" it about six or seven times a day, and it is by far his favorite (the other favorite is \\"where's the bone\\" by manhattan toys). Regarding fragility, the twisting twirly gigs stopped twisting pretty soon, and the wiggle wobble widgets never worked quite right, but the fluttering flicker clickers are surprisingly durable; they still clatter very nicely. I do wish it were not made of paper but something my son could touch; he is so enamored of the pieces that he constantly lunges for them and it feels terrible to hold him back.<br /><br />I still can't find one of the red dots.

B003JTHESA|5.0|Ahhh... new Maiden. The thought of a new Iron Maiden album always sends people into a frenzy. \\" Holy crap, I have to pick this up as soon as I can!\\" Well, I'm here to say that this attention is well deserved. The Final Frontier is Maiden's 15th album, for those who haven't been counting. It continues the progressive direction from AMOLAD. For me, this album didn't click at first. However, at the second listen (because I don't give up on Maiden), I started to understand what was going on. The opening track, for example, takes four and a half minutes to hit its stride. Once it does though, it's prime Maiden throughout.    As for individual performances, the one that stands out for me is Bruce Dickinson. He sounds like the envy of a vocalist half his age. I know, I'm 18 and can't resist singing along to songs on this thing, just as I did when I first heard Number of the Beast. The only song I can't give him praise on is Mother of Mercy. Awkward lyrics and chorus kinda destroy the point of the song. The triple guitar attack is still as potent as ever, with Dave, Adrian, and Janick ripping this album to shreds(in a good way). Nicko Mcbrain, as always, provides a great rhythm to this album. Harris isn't very active on this album, besides the bass intro to the first two tracks. However, he writes most of the songs, so he makes up for the lack of bass with his excellent songwriting skill.    The album starts with Satellite 15... The Final Frontier. After a very alien ( and very long intro), the band rocks it and doesn't stop for the 70+ minute run time. There are really no standout tracks for me, because their all excellent in their own way. The only track I can't like is Mother of Mercy( description in the above paragraph). Calling this album epic would be an epic understatement. However, they remain epic without being cheesy or being instrumentally showy( see Dream Theater).    Personally, I prefer the longer songs and progressive territory the band has crossed into. However, I don't think the longer songs will keep away the extremely loyal fans away. In fact, I would put this album as their best since, dare I say it, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Blasphemy, you say. Well, whatever your opinion of the band, this is sure to please Iron Maiden fans, old and new. Don't believe me? Give it a couple listens and tell me otherwise.    4.5 stars. Highly Recommended.
B002TYZKIM|2.0|I wasn't sure what this was before buying it.  It turned out to be a compilation of footage of rehearsal sessions, sound checks, dress rehearsals, etc. for the big London concert that was never to be.  Obviously they didn't know MJ was gonna die when they shot this.  The quality of the footage varies.  Were they intending to release this before he died, or was this footage meant until then for internal consumption only?<br /><br />I admit it's an interesting, though sanitized, look at what goes on behind the scenes during the preparation for a show like this.<br /><br />But what disappointed me was that Michael's voice was shot.  His dancing was also lackluster.  Even the most unremarkable of his back-up stage dancers, could have totally killed him.  The guy was about 50 when this was shot, and this film makes it obvious he shouldn't have been singing and dancing that way anymore (noticeable and repeated breakings of his voice).<br /><br />Plus, the choreography for the songs themselves was a major let-down, with a couple of exceptions (e.g., \\"Thriller\\").  Was that really what they were doing to do with \\"Billie Jean\\"?  Wow.  And for \\"Beat It\\"?  That's all they could come up with?
B003LXM1RS|4.0|Tearing a page out of the \\"Flashdance\\" handbook, Scissor Sister's third album plays like a sweaty striptease at some late night bar on Santa Monica boulevard. The band slithers and grooves its way across an album that seems seductive and smarmy, lustful and lascivious.<br /><br />This time around the band creates a far more straightforward dance album with producer Stuart Price. The results are very 80's meets 70's dance floor leg warmers. The theme of sexual exploration set against a night of experimentation permeates the album. From \\"Whole New Way\\", \\"Any Which Way\\", \\"Harder You Get\\", \\"Skin This Cat\\", \\"Skin Tight\\" and \\"Sex and Violence\\" you can tell the band is living up to its name.<br /><br />There are some blissful moments such as the vocal melody on \\"Fire With Fire\\", one of the best tracks here with its anthemic hopefulness. Elsewhere, the band incorporates Kraftwerk's \\"Radioactivity\\" into \\"Something Like This\\". And then there's the six minute trance-like \\"Invisible Light\\" that closes the album--a track that shows the band moving in a slightly different direction.<br /><br />With all this retro 80's and 70's mash-up it seems as if the band is holding steady. What I mean by this is, all three of Scissor Sisters' albums are neither classic five star albums or below average one star albums. They break even every time. As much as I liked \\"Night Work\\" I found myself wondering if this is all the band plans to do musically--mash up past musical trends. Or will they be daring and shift gears for their next album? The mark of a great band is one who begins with trends, and then develops into something all their own. Scissor Sisters keep threatening its fans with a really great album, but it hasn't materialized just yet.<br /><br />Four stars, because \\"Night Work\\" is entertaining and catchy, never dull or uninspired. Yet, it's not more than that. The lyrics are a bit pedestrian, as if the band was afraid to really push the envelope like Prince did in his best days. I found myself listening to the lyrics thinking that there's nothing new there. There could have been something more. Musically, \\"Night Work\\" is a nice retro-feel album with a modern twist, but just listen to a band like Passion Pit, and how they turn a retro sound into something approaching original. I think Scissor Sisters played it safe here. I wonder what the scrapped album sounded like before they went ahead and gave us this? Was it more experimental? Would it have alienated fans? I wonder.<br /><br />Here's my comparison chart for \\"Night Work\\" compared to Scissor Sisters' previous work:<br /><br />2004 Scissor Sisters: Four Stars<br />2006 Ta-Dah: Four Stars<br />2010 Night Work: Four Starss thinking that there's nothing new there.

B0036EH3WU|5.0|I know there is a lot of debate over the finale, but I would encourage everyone to look at the show as a whole when thinking about buying this product.    LOST offers you a journey into a world of deep character connections, thought provoking stories, and almost no fillers. Unlike many TV shows in today's day and age, LOST does not attempt to simplify or reduce the complexity of its story for newcomers. If you don't start at the beginning and watch sequentially you will be Lost.     That being said, I personally think this was one of the most well done shows to date. It had me passionate, immersed, and deep in thought for 6 years, emotions that no other TV show has come even close to obtaining.    This show is also laden heavily with mysteries. And if you are paying attention most of these mysteries and questions will be answered, though others will be left open. If you want to be spoon fed answers then this may not be the show for you, but if you want to have to interpret, analyze and thinking about the questions and answered provided, then you will be more satisfied with LOST then any other show.    This does not mean that the writers of this show will answer every question with a deep mathematical proof for life. the answers may be vague or up to some interpretation. This is all part of making a good mystery. If everything is proven and answered to death, you lose the deep complex storytelling and end up with another mindless sitcom.     If this sounds like a show you might like, then I would definitely recommend picking up at least the first season if not the entire collection, and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.

0143038583|5.0|This is a truly marvellous book - a must read for anybody interested in knowing more about what they eat, where it originally came from and how it got to their plates. The sheer breadth of topics discussed is mind-boggling. The perils of modern industrial food production. The smokescreens behind which these dangers are hidden and those which we choose not to see. Until, of course, a salmonella infection hits us. The wastages involved in this process. Are big organic companies truly organic? How food \\"grown\\" on a small scale, in harmony with nature, is probably the best solution. On the scalability of these methods. What it takes to prepare a meal from scratch - yes, really really scratch. And, much more.    There is no ranting, no speculation. Just cold, incisive analysis. Pollan's clarity of thought, elegant writing style and above all, his drive to keep asking questions until he gets to the root of the matter makes this book special.
B003JTHESA|5.0|track-by-track review.     1. \\"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier\\" (Smith, Harris)   Contrary to what you might have been led to believe by the official video, this song is actually 8:40 minutes long, half of it being a very, very, very unusual intro for Iron Maiden -- 4:40 minutes of an eerie piece of futuristic, space-like, void-feeling material, slow-paced but at the same time emanating disturbing melodies before those known hard-rock chords can soar. From then on it's the same thing you hear on the band's official video.     2. \\"El Dorado\\" (Smith, Harris, Dickinson)   Not much to say. GOOD SONG BUT I'm just very glad that it's probably the worst song on the album.     3. \\"Mother of Mercy\\" (Smith, Harris)   Rather slow-paced, not a rapid, furious & heavy-rhythm'ed as I had thought it would be before listening to it. It's a tune I actually wouldn't picture Iron Maiden coming up with. It's very Maiden in its simplicity, but at the same time the melody itself is not usual in terms of what we've witnessed in the past 15 years. Which is, I must say, something that pervades the entire album, this tendency to venture into the unexplored.     4. \\"Coming Home\\" (Smith, Harris, Dickinson)   Wow, a balad. But this sounds very much like a Bruce Dickinson ballad, rather than an Iron Maiden one. Think \\"Tyranny of Souls\\" (the album), though (not \\"Accident of Birth\\"). Very catchy chorus, and a very nice melody throughout. I'm thinking the band will be playing this one live.   5. \\"The Alchemist\\" (Gers, Harris, Dickinson)   Truly, this has nothing to do with Bruce's homonymous song. Not quite unlike what's Maiden's done since 2000, however. This one's more forward than the previous tracks (Satellite 15 excepted), with a nice chorus too, mainly because of the guitar trio coming up with those harmonic combinations that completely fill out the background. There's also some modulation thrown in, which you don't see a lot in Maiden. I personally enjoy the guitar melody on the bridge and chorus for this song. Solo exclusively by Janick, followed by the 3 guitars. Falls back to the chorus and the song ends (very similar to the \\"Coming Home\\" approach).     6. \\"Isle of Avalon\\" (Smith, Harris)   If it weren't for the bass right in the beginning, you wouldn't guess this is a Maiden tune, even though it is somehow in synch with what the band's been doing since Kevin Shirley took up the production seat with the boys. Mysterious-like melody, but fast-paced intro, which holds on for a good 2 and a half minutes before it finally picks up at around 2:50, with an interesting vigor. It falls again to a certain mystery-ridden melody right after, before a short Dave Murray solo kicks in at around 3:40, followed by some solid rhythm-base session, and then by Adrian playing a little with what seem to be synthetizers (you may hear some Somewhere in Time-like material at this point, even though the song itself is far from that). You gotta think in terms of epic-like material, in the same line as Alexander the Great, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and Sign of the Cross. It's 9 minutes long, and it's one of those songs where you'll pay closer attention to the lyrics while some interesting tune plays in the background (and not the other way around). The chorus is very nice, however, and brings the melody forward.     7. \\"Starblind\\" (Smith, Harris, Dickinson)   I thought it would be another slow song, but then some distortion guitars kick in, gladly. The main part of the song (not the bridge or chorus) is a very solid crescendo, whih sounds very amazing to me, and they build just the right amount of expectation. Bridge's very good too, and you know you got something good on your hands. It's hard to correctly describe this song. It's not fast, but it's not exactly slow-paced either. It's a very interesting tune, really, with a few unexpected twist and turns, and sometimes some of its distortion guitar levels sound as though they had nothing but a Fender-like sound to it, as if they had only had said Fender amp to provide heaviness (this goes mainly for Adrian or Janick). Adrian seems to have used synthetizers for his soloes, however -- with some mean reverb on them. Bruce does very well here, singing a solid tune with variations, going from low to high-pitched notes in the same sentence. There's some modulation present here, too. All in all it's a good song, and you may feel hooked even though it's almost 8-minutes long.     8. \\"The Talisman\\" (Gers, Harris)   Beautiful beginning. The production and general feel very closely resemble what you hear in \\"The Legacy\\" (A Matter if Life and Death's last track). This actually perdures for 2:20 minutes until some power rhythm guitars kick in with more solid, heavy riffs making the bed where Bruce seems to comfortably lie in. Very forward tune, which I thought somewhat lacking at times, because it's a long album, and some of the tunes (like \\"Mother of Mercy\\" and \\"Coming Home\\" being put together, one after the other) sort of gives you the feeling that things are somewhat slow for a while. Also, much like \\"Dance of Death\\" and \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\", this album is filled with little, slow acoustic intros that tend to make you feel like there isn't much punch or drive to it. \\"The Talisman\\" can show a lot of raw power, however, which is always a good thing when it comes to Maiden. Nice vocal melodies at around 5 minutes into the song, with great soloes right after. They remind me some of the material on \\"Fear is the Key\\", probably because of the vibrato unit/tremolo bar being used. Good song.     9. \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" (Dave Murray, Harris)   Again slow intro. But nice follow-up, with solid bass chords underlying the guitar melody -- which, to be honest, remind me a lot of \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". The drums come in, in a crescendo, and then we got some heavy, forward-sounding riffs and Bruce's vocal lines (which now remind me somewhat of \\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\"). Allin all this is a tune of its own, truly. As you reach 4 minutes, you will be listening to some really (really!) different material. I'm betting you could never guess this to be Iron Maiden. Very unlike what's been done in 30 years of history. You'll understand what I mean when you listen to this. At around 6 minutes, when Bruce sings again, his vocal lines remind me of Dance of Death's \\"Wildest Dreams\\". This song's 8-and-a-half minutes long, and it does feel long (unlike other, longer Iron Maiden tunes, I must say).     10. \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\"   Last -- and longest -- song on the album. As usual, a slow-paced intro, but gladly, off the top of my head, it doesn't remind me of any other Maiden song. It's as if it wants to, but it doesn't. Beautiful tune, really, and great change of pace at around 3:40. Adrian comes in with a solo at 4:46, followed by Dave, and both melodies are tremendously beautiful. This is possibly the song with most potential on the whole album, and I'm very pleased to say that even though it's 11:01 minutes long, ranking as the 3rd longest Iron Maiden song

I've seen some critics complain that the plot is familiar, and it is, but you know what? So are most plots. What matters is execution, and the execution in this film is terrific! The cast is wonderful, everyone has a great sense of comedic timing and is equally great at the subtle or dramatic moments as needed, and there's great chemistry among them. They're also all extremely easy on the eyes -- a definite bonus. The characters are interesting and fun, the dialog is snappy, and there are some surprisingly poignant moments. Zoe Saldana's character is absolutely awesome, especially in that -- unlike in so many movies of this type -- she's not just the love interest, and her motivations are entirely independent. The characters of the Losers themselves fit together like pieces of a terrific puzzle, and the little moments between them and among them really make them believable as a team who's been together through a LOT, which is one of the things I love most.    This is a great action/comedy/drama that is both really satisfying and makes you want more. I've cut way back on my DVD-buying since Netflix, but this is one I had to have! I've watched it many times, and will watch it many more. A+++, would buy again!    If you want to see more of what you'd be getting, you can probably find some clips on YouTube. Be wary of spoilers, though -- especially in the clip about how Jensen forgot his gun. That one contains a HUGE spoiler, so avoid it if possible.    The special features on the Blu-Ray disc are also great. The regular DVD only has one, which is also on the Blu-Ray disc, and is itself a very good feature, but if you like special features and have a Blu-Ray player or have been thinking about getting one, I recommend the Blu-Ray version. And let's face it, more and more releases are going to do this to us, where you can only get the really robust special features on the Blu-Ray. I bought a Playstation 3 so I could watch these and I don't regret it.    Of course, Dragon Age: Origins has eaten my life, because I got that for the PS3 not really thinking I'd play it much.... *eye-dart*
0375842209|5.0|This book is really amazing, raw and pure, it isn't sugar-coated with lies just to please the reader, Marcus Zusak just tells truth. I loved it! It made me sob at the end. My favorite character was definitley Rudy Steiner (the boy with hair the color of lemons). If you want to laugh and cry at the same time, this is the book for you. What makes is so extremely interesting is that the book is in the perspective of Death and its view on World War II! So interesting:)
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Maybe its my age but I had a helluva good time watching this movie.  I saw the negative press and reactions from co-workers and friends so I stood away from viewing it on the big screen and boy, can I ever kick myself.  The film emerges as a hommage to the sword and fantasy films of the sixties and the Saturday Matinee excursions that erupted at that time.  I was never a fan of the original film.  I always thought that it was too childlike and some of Ray Harryhausen's work was not up to par and the performances seem to be forced , becoming a veritable who's who of British cinema at that time.  Director Louis Leterrier has successfully updated the storyline and piles on the thrills as never before while never sacrificing his actors, instead they become part of the tapestry of magical images that the Special Effects have become in the last decade. The set pieces are all here,  Never have I seen such an incredible incarnation of the Medusa legend as in this film. When Perseus and his men leave Charon's ship, they encounter a petrified forest of trees and bodies which reminds us of the scene in 'MEDUSA AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES', the volcanic wasteland within Medusa's lair reminds us of Hades in Mario Bava's 'HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD', The Pegasus introduction reminded me of the Steve Reeves/Arthur Lubin fantasy from the sixties 'THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD', the scorpion sequence reminds us of their old relatives in Willis O'Briens 'THE BLACK SCORPION' from the fifties and the Kraken sequence has peppered hommages to 'KING KONG', the list goes on.  Even the character of BUBO from the original film is shown and tossed aside by one of the men.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes actually resemble two jealous brothers vying for power and they chew up the scenery with just the right bravado.  The music score by Ramin Djawadi is excellent and rousing rising to the occasions throughout.  All in all, a wonderful experience and a film which did not deserve the negativisms it received.  Great eye candy and escapist fare making you truly believe that there really are winged horses among us.  Thats a pretty tall order in these robotically modern times. Highly recommended.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This 4 CD set is very interesting and educational.  You will see things you never saw before.  It is about life all over the planet, whether in the sea, air or land.  We have some most unusual inhabitants in our world.  There are some funny spots when you see the antics of some animals.  I am constantly amazed at HOW they got these films and WHERE was the photographer was to be able to film the scenes. (the photographers went through a LOT to get these scenes.) Our whole family has been interested in this, down to the grandchildren, and they are interesting to see over and over.  The unusual scenes really do hold your interest - even the kids. David Attenborough's narration is right on target with his vast knowledge and experience with the natural world. His timing and attention to detail is impecable.    The Bluray makes it unbelieveably clear and so colorful! Get this - you'll be glad you did.
B000001F76|5.0|awesome cd. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in Hank Williams.
0307474712|4.0|Emma and Dexter meet on July 15th, 1988, the day the graduate from University, and the rest is history. We follow Emma and Dexter on every subsequent July 15th for the next 20 years. We see bad jobs and great vacations, one night stands and sad serious relationships, but mostly we see two great friends trying to live life as best they can.    I had been hearing great things about One Day for a while now and it seemed like the perfect summer read. It definitely lived up to it's reputation. By the end I felt like I had been on a long and emotional journey with a girl not unlike myself and a guy a little to attractive for his own good. Only seeing people one day a year was interesting. It was obvious that things had happened, sometimes big things sometimes not, but regardless we got all the important information without all the little details. It was a great representation of the times it travels through.    My only issues with One Day aren't really plot or structure related. Dexter is pretty self centered and obnoxious and at times it is hard to care for him, but that is kind of his purpose. Never the less it is still a little trying to get through his \\"I'm only twenty (blank)\\" phase.    If you've got the time I'd definitely recommend One Day. I feel like I was taught a huge lesson about life after finishing it, though i'm still not sure what that lesson is. This one will stay with you for a while!
0545091020|5.0|LOVE it. Great to listen to while on long trips and cleaning.  Cheaper than at big chain bookstore.
0307346617|5.0|This book is an absolute must read.  My husband picked it up first, then I got in to it.  I have since passed it to all my coworkers (I am in the military).  We all LOVE it.  I think it offers a plausible scenario of what would happen in the world if an apocalyptic event were to occur.  Substitute zombies for a new super disease, and you can easily see this happening.  You can not believe the amount of discussions that have been generated by this novel.  Even if you HATE sci-fi/zombie books, I recommend this novel.
0385532458|1.0|I've just begun this book.  After reading the very very bad first story, I struggle to continue. I have hope that the stories will get better.  After all, when one pays 8 dollars for a PAPERBACK, one better read the damn thing.
B000YAA68C|2.0|The DVD was in good condition but 3/4 into the movie it stopped working, I was able to forward past the part but I missed about 15 minutes of the movie and that was disapointing.
B003NX75B8|4.0|It's been a while since I laughed out loud and felt fluffy inside from reading a book. \\"Will Grayson, will grayson\\" did it for me. The story is realistic and emotional without being too depressing or cheesy. I can't really pinpoint what I got out from the book but by the time I put it down I was mesmerized by the characters and the transition they went through. It's nothing short of fascination and compassion.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|i grew up on the GI JOE cartoon series back in the 1980s and i loved this film. going to buy the dvd for my own collection. heart pulse pounding action and fighting thru out. i rented it on netflix but i have to buy one!
0881030376|4.0|As an English teacher I believe this is a novel that we should all read because of its iconic status in American literature. Many allusions are made to Lenny Smalls in film and literature which would go totally misunderstood if one had not read the novel. It is a quick and easy read.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|Easton Corbin is going to be big, very soon.  I heard his first hit \\"I'm a Little More Country Than That\\" and had to get the CD.  The first song is \\"Roll With It\\" and I knew it would be a #1 hit and sure enough, it was.  This kid has a strong voice and is quite the songwriter, too.  I just saw him at the Blue Bonnet Palace outside of San Antonio and he puts on a heck of a show.  His music covers the full spectrum from ballads to sing along melodies that you just can't get out of your head.  Do yourself a favor and buy this CD.  You will be glad you did!
B003J27WFW|5.0|Watching \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\" a documetary on the band RUSH is like visitng with an old and dear friend.  There are moments of nostalgia, surprise and clarity that remind the viewer just why this band and their incredible catalogue hold such a distinct place in music history.    Presented in the film are two childhood friends (Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson) who dreamed about forging a musical path and the \\"new guy\\" (Neal Peart) who when joining the band made that dream a reality.  The filmmakers give the fans enough fodder and provide the \\"not so familiar\\" with detail that love them/hate them, you walk away from the film with the knowledge that this is not only a band striving for perfection in their art, but a group of friends who share a deep love and respect for one another after being together for over 30 years!  This point is all too evident in the filmmaker's handling of the tradgedy that struck Neal Peart's life in the loss of both his daughter and wife.      As a fan of over 20 years, I was delighted in the amount of detail provided in the film with the band's origin and its member's constant strides to change, evolve, perfect, and challenge their musical sound and abilities.  Sometimes those changes lost fans, but you have to admire that in the end, it has always been about the music and what Alex, Geddy and Neal felt they needed to explore.    All in all, \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\", for me, is a wonderful visit with three friends whose music has touched my life and seen me through the \\"ups\\" and \\"downs\\" the many years I have \\"known\\" them.    By purchasing this film, I know that I can visit with them any time and \\"that's good enough for me\\".
B003J27WFW|5.0|An intriguing inside look at the most popular cult band of all time. The directors keep the storyline moving forward, with plenty of commentary thrown in by other artists such as Sebastian Bach, Gene Simmons, and Jack Black.   An obvious \\"must have\\" for Rush fans, but even the \\"Greatest Hits Only\\" lovers should find this film interesting, if not down right hilarious at times (especially the bonus material on Disc Two).
B001HN694K|5.0|Johnny Depp adds a new dimension to everything he does and the Mad Hatter is no exception. The DVD is in excellent condition and came very soon after it was ordered. The whole family enjoyed it and will watch it several times to appreciate all the nuances. One of my granddaughters asked about the Lewia Carroll original novel and I have unearthed my childhood copy for her to read. Somewhere I also have a copy of Alice Through the Lookingglass that should turn up. I had an \\"annotated Alice\\" that I can't find and would be pleased to know if Amazon has access to this publication.
B003JTHESA|1.0|So Iron Maiden release finally their new studio album \\"the final frontier\\" I've given the album about 5 listens, and I was hoping it would grow on me, and it just is not happening. This is my least liked maiden album ever released. There is not one song on this album that i like, and i have tried to like this album because i love maiden! The songs are way too dragged out. I love maidens progressive and epic sides, but i really just don't like how its done on this album. The riffs are very bland, and nothing really catches my ear. Maiden always had a way of writing super catchy riffs, and melodies. This time around nothing seems to grab me. Bruce also does not sound quite right on this album. He seems like he is pushing himself to a limit. The solos are good!, but it seems that the solos are the only thing i look forward to in every song on this album, and that does not cut it with me. I also think the production on this album is horrible. It sounds way too bassy, and in general sounds weak. I understand that they don't want to repeat themselves, but maiden has in the past successfully modernized their classic sound without losing their identity, and still kept it fresh. like A Brave new world. That album is a awesome modern take on maiden, and i loved it. Even \\"dance of death\\" and \\"A matter of life or death\\" had really great moments, but something on This new album is just lacking. This type of maiden is just not my cup of tea. I still recommend Maiden fans to listen to it, because you may find something you like in it. I'll just continue to listening to Killers, Number of the beast, Brave new world, and their other albums!
B002VR9QY6|5.0|I've read elsewhere that this is an 'old-fashioned' version of the much loved classic and the first act is certainly what you would expect.Jolly villagers cavort in a bucolic setting in the usual way and the betrayal of Giselle is expertly played out by Tsygankova and Varga who are beautiful to watch.The mad scene is heart-wrenching and although some camerawork is too far from the action conversely there are fewer close-ups of perspiring dancers (thank goodness) so it all works as a well-produced piece.Having several versions of the work I thought this one was developing well,until the second act which confirmed my reasons for buying the dvd after seeing it streamed on a website.Finally there was a Myrtha (Igone de Jongh) who not only looks the part but plays it as the icy cold Queen of the Wilis she is meant to be.No matronly leader of lost girls here- for although impressive grand jetes floated her across the stage,even better was the intensity she put into the characterisation of the role.This was a Myrtha totally implacable and inflexible which made the appeals by Giselle even more despairing and moving as she attempts to save Albrecht.So the drama is played out with the background corps de ballet moving well and being given loud applause by an appreciative audience.Anna Tsygankova and Jozef Varga are flawless,Hilarion again catches our sympathy and dies well to round out an exceptional second act which is enough in itself to buy this version.The additions and changes to music and choreography didn't interfere thankfully while the 5.1 surround sound is what we've come to expect so if you want to see how the second act should be done, this is the version to have.And as a bonus- how interesting it is to see interviews of the principals compared to their stage personas !

B003JLA4KS|5.0|The people I bought this for were thrilled and loved watching it.  They had watched it on VH-1 and it was a must for their collection.  I have to admit not being hard rock fan; I was impressed with Rush members' lives.  This is a perfect gift for a RUSH fan.
B003JTHETY|3.0|Don't Get Me Wrong People.I rarely wright A review here.But after this release i felt the need to.I'am a long time fan of everything Maiden.Since 1984's Powerslave album which was one Of my first Metal albums i ever bought.When i was just 14 years old. Since then Maiden has become my most favorite Metal group of all time. Now on to the new album.What the hell happened? This album to me has shocked me.I know everyone has there own opinion out there and this is mine.A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH to me is one of their GREATEST albums of all time.That's how much i loved that album.That album has everything a Maiden fan could ever want.But to go from that to this is just unbelievable.1st the production sucks.This album sounds muddy.2nd Bruce Is not at his best here.I believe this could be his worst vocals ever done.And it hurts me to have to say this because he happens to be my most favorite singer of all time.But this is not even up to par.3rd Bruce sounds like he is reading the songs from a book.It's Like they made most of the songs from the album straight out of books.Is this stealing? It's like they wrote parts from other peoples books and put them together or something.4th the songs on the album are really not good.They are not up to par for a group like this.I know people don't want the same old album released everytime.Neither do i but this album is so far out there it's not even close to being as great as their last one.And this album makes Dance of Death look greater then it is.It's hard for me to have to say these last words about them.But i believe this could be the very end for THE GREAT IRON MAIDEN the ride may very well be over with. THE TROOPER.
B002RSDW80|2.0|I'd heard great things about \\"Julie and Julia\\", but was left disappointed.  While the movie was fun and cute, that's all it was.  There was little characterization, and the treatment of Julia Child's love with her husband seemed unrealistic (they never fight?) and lacking in any depth.  Julie and Eric's relationship seemed petty, both in its love without any apparent foundation (and no reason ever given for their move to an apartment that Julie hates from the start), and their petty fights over very little.  I never got attached to them as characters, or to Julie's blogging and cooking project.  Overall, highly underwhelming, and I'll be trading out my copy.

B003HFFVDQ|4.0|This feels like a familiar shoe - slipping into the best of the ChemBros, all the usual ingredients, guest vocalists, electro-orgasmatronica.  Nothing particularly original, but all very enjoyable.
B002RI9QJE|4.0|I purchased the book because I saw Dan Ariely on a TED talk ([...]). I was so fascinated with the talk and then I got fascinated with the book.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you are a little curious about human behavior.
030745455X|5.0|This book deserves the hype it's getting.  Once I started, I barely came up for air. It's a compelling crime drama with wonderful, fully drawn characters who are as believable as they are unusual.  I'm so sad that there won't be any more in the series.

B001TKEG9G|5.0|he Bennet sisters are in danger of being poor and homeless should their father die and at least one of them not be married.  When a new neighbor, Mr. Bingley, moves to the neighborhood and appears to be single, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters will marry him.  What ensues is an interesting courtship between Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet, the oldest of the sisters. During the course of this courtship, Jane's younger sister, the headstrong Elizabeth, encounters the brooding Mr. Darcy, a dear friend of Mr. Bingley. Their first impressions of each other are not amiable and lead to dislike on both sides.  The dislike is enforced on Elizabeth's side by her new acquaintance, Mr. Wickham.  She openly accepts Mr. Wickham's reports of Mr. Darcy and her prejudice grows. A surprising proposal by Mr. Darcy and its aftermath lead Elizabeth to rethink her prejudices. What she can not know is that Mr. Darcy's pride is also being reanalyzed by himself.  Will the two ever be able to overcome their pride and prejudice? And if they can, what will be the result of it?<br /><br />This was the first time I have read Pride and Prejudice and it has cemented Jane Austen as one of my favorite authors.  The story line was intricate, marked by detail, humor and romance. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are an enjoyable match and I sympathized with Elizabeth's irritation. I was especially amused by the character of Mr. Bennet. His wit had me laughing, while at other times, his parenting skills appeared to be sorely lacking.<br /><br />Austen masterfully crafted this story that was published when she was only 21.  I am a little in awe of Jane Austen.  The two other books by her that I have read were good, but, in my opinion, this one is the best.<br /><br />This Barnes & Noble Classic edition included an Introduction and Notes by Carol Howard. The Notes were especially helpful in understanding certain portions and the introduction was good.  However, the introduction contained a lot of spoilers and I am thankful I read it after reading the book.oilers and I am thankful I read it after reading the book.
1572814349|2.0|The deck is pretty even though the artwork is overly Christian.  The US Games logo is small on the picture side of each card.  The gold lining on the cards is beautiful.  What's not beautiful is the glitter all over your hands when you shuffle the deck.  The gold is obviously a cheap quality is that gets everywhere!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is incredible. I proclaim myself a fanboy. I mean, gosh darn it, Christopher Nolan took his filmmaking excellence to a whole 'nother level with this one. Filmed on location in Chicago, it features a huge truck wreck, a bank robbery, an enormous explosion, and a loco hombre with a pastey face and a lot of crazy ideas rattling in his head. He leaps giddily from one demonic impulse to the next, eager to get the rest of Gotham on his murderous, anarchist wagon.    Take a look at the Blu-Ray picture. Ten years ago, it would have been fit for a straight-to-video cartoon movie for whatever people still follow and enjoy the shows (I don't know any such humans). But in 2008, how the ache ee double hockey sticks did Batman swoop back into style and become the biggest box office draw of the year and stomp a foothold into world cinema statistics.    Everyone has discussed the greatness of Heath Ledger in the role, and it's really sort of incapable of being overstated; he becomes a role that will haunt the dreams of all those little kids that managed to see it, and for that, such should be honored.    Thank you Joker, Batman, Two-Face, Lieutenant, and hey! Also Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer. And the many many people. Don't waste more time, go get this and love it: if for nothing else, than because ofthe awesome sex scene.

He is not trying to convince you of anything, he is just weaving a story between fact, fiction and theory that's all.  REMEMBER: this book is non-fiction.  Let go of the conspiracy stuff and enjoy!!!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I enjoy all of Rage Against the Machine's music, considering they are a band that drew me into alternative rock/metal and out of nu metal back in the day when I was but a wee lad. However, whereas Evil Empire is merely good and RATM (the debut) is the universally preferred classic, this one is my favorite. While I do absolutely love the power of songs like Freedom and Wake Up and Killing in the Name and Bullet in Your Head, this album, The Battle of Los Angeles, is the sound of a more mature, more stream-lined band with songs where all the parts come together more fluidly. And oh, the riffs! Tom Morello is clearly descended from the great rock stylists of yesterday. The bass is deep, thunderous at the highs and moody and contemplative at the lows. The percussion of Brad Wilk is more exciting than any drum machine or synthesized beat, which is what makes the rap elements of Rage's work all the more powerful. I would care to highlight the opening rush of Calm Like a Bomb, the breakdown of Mic Check, and the main riff of Maria. I dunno why, but these elements were favorites. I'm also reminded, as I write this review, of a comparison someone around the Internet made between \\"Sleep Now in the Fire\\" and the Stooges' \\"T.V. Eye\\". Whaddya think?    If you're gonna buy only one Rage release (which is ill-advised but hey whatever), get this one. I also greatly enjoy Audioslave, though they're a different beast altogether. If you like the musicianship and instrumentalism here, try Out of Exile, their second album.    That's all I've got to say about that.
B000002PCS|5.0|The CD arrived and I could hardly wait to play it. As the music soared throughout the house it was so hauntly beautiful and relaxing. I have always loved music of all types, but this just was exceptionly moving. I would highly reccomend it to music lovers anytime.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is quite possibly my favorite album of the 90s. A beautiful piece of orchestral majesty, really. This album no doubt predicts the whole future of humankind, which is on the road to robotic dominance. It's musically great, with Thom Yorke becoming the most distinctive vocalist of the new age. And the guitars weave in and out of the production with static-ridden pulses and sparks throughout. You've also got the other sounds, creating a wild planet for the all band members' musicial sensibilities to roam. And the songs all stand brilliantly on their own, Airbag, Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Exit Music for a Film, Let Down, Karma Police, (not Fitter Happier which is terrible crap) Electioneering, Climbing up a Wall, No Surprises, Lucky, and The Tourist. The song listing seems like merely a list of wildy successful cult indie movies on a Sundance bill, but don't be deterred! Not as though anyone should be, considering Sundance is \\"brilliant\\", pun intended.
0670021652|1.0|I had high expectations after Eat Prey Love....I got it 2 months ago and I can't finish it. It has some interesting info though....but I wouldn't recommend it even though it's a continuation of Eat Prey Love (that's why I got it,  at least).    UPDATE  9/20/2011    So, how many years has it been since I bought this book???? Over a year and I am not done reading it. BORING! It has some good thinking material but wow! how hard it is to read! It's crazy! and I love reading! Elizabeth Gilbert got me back into reading with her \\"eat prey love\\" but this one is a waste of time. I am changing my rating to 1 star and changing it from \\"kinda boring\\" to \\"highly boring\\".  Should have just borrowed this one at the library instead of wasting $.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love to exercise and I especially love to run. I can't run without good music. I have tried out so many different headphones from really expensive to really cheap. I have tried the buds that fit in the ears. I have tried the headphones that wrap around your ears. I have tried the old-school headphones with the soft earphone piece, but nothing really works well. My ears are too small to hold the buds in. I have even tried the ear buds with the buds and they don't hold well enough while I exercise. The big soft ones feel too hot. So I decided to try out these cheaper, less fancy headphones and they worked like a charm. I have actually bought three different pairs (two for my kids to use with their music). They are adjustable. They fit into my ears and don't fall out when I run or cycle. The sound quality is just fine. I just want to hear music and I want the headphones to stay in/on my ears and these fit the bill. I highly recommend these headphones...especially if you have trouble with the wrap around or buds not fitting or staying in/on your ears properly.

0451528018|5.0|With its unique and detailed setting that takes place in the past with mild moorlands and an evil feel, The Hound of the Baskervilles is a very goodd mystery novel. A novel that keeps you thinking, debating, guessing, and wanting to read more, which I personally think is the key to a good book. In this novel, good is pitted against evil, and realism against the supernatural, as Sherlock Holmes tries to defeat a very worthy and powerful foe. Throughout the novel, Holmes characteristically dismisses the following theory: Could the sudden and tragic death of Sir Charles Baskerville have been caused by a gigantic ghostly hound which is said to have haunted his family for generations? Claiming to be caught up in another case, he sends his partner Watson to Devon to protect the Baskerville heir and to observe the suspects closely. As the novel continues, the outcome of this murder case is slowly but surely solved in this very good mystery novel.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|My wife and I watched the premier of this movie on HBO the night it was released and absolutely adored it. This is one amazing woman and an inspiration to everyone, young and old. Showing that, no matter what circumstances surround a human beings life... they can always make the best of it, if they find that one thing that helps them get by. With autism on the rise, year after year, every parent with children... or prospective parents, should watch this movie. If your child/children are healthy, then it serves as an inspiration and reminder of how precious life is and how lucky you are to have healthy children. If your child has been diagnosed with any condition, this is a movie that will bring home the importance of love and unhindered support that is most important in any childs life... healthy or not.    Claire Danes is so believable in this role, that you would swear that it is Temple Grandin herself. She deserves an Oscar for this role. How she got passed by for an Oscar or an Emmy is beyond me. The sheer work involved, in not only getting the look down... but also the voice and mannerisms... amazing! Everyone involved with this project deserves credit. I am not sure why they didnt release this in the theater, as it had blockbuster potential.    This is one of those movies that tugs at your heart strings and makes you want to be a better person. I hope that everyone gives this a chance. It is a great date night movie, for you guys out there.    I am a 39 year old man and every time I get a chance to watch this movie on HBO, I watch it. It is just a fun movie, that never gets old.
B003VWC4AI|2.0|I can recommend the paperback edition of this book for its size and weight.  At 275 pages and roughly 5\\" x 8\\" it is easily transported, and can be read comfortably on an airplane.    It is primarily a collection of anecdotes about people overcoming an educational system that failed to provide a fertile ground for their talents.  The likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Meg Ryan, Chuck Close, Matt Groening, Ridley Scott, Sir Richard Branson, etc., were fortunate to find their Element - that place where \\"the things you love to do and the things that you are good at come together.\\"    All well and good, but as the author points out:    \\"There is a risk in giving example of people who have found their Element.  Their stories can be inspiring, of course, but they can also be depressing.  After all, these people seem blessed in some way; they've had the good fortune to do what they love to do and be very good at doing it.\\"    For me, it wasn't a risk, but a certainty.  I rapidly grew weary of reading about all these people that are able to exploit their talents into \\"lifestyles of the rich and famous\\".    The reality is, only a small percentage of people can do what they love and earn a living from it, especially in the arts.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't try, but there are a lot of bitter people out there who were sold this bill of goods and, at best, ended up financially insolvent for some period of their lives, and at worst succumbed to depression, seeking personal anesthesia in alcohol, drugs or suicide.    The author blames the school systems for draining creativity from children.  \\"Education is the system that's supposed to develop our natural abilities and enable us to make our way in the world.  Instead, it is stifling  the individual talents and abilities of too many students and killing their motivation to learn.\\"    This places a tremendous burden on \\"Education\\".  Who said that its the responsibility of the schools to develop our natural abilities?  Right or wrong, education is structured to give a foundation in the process of learning, and provide a shared knowledge base so that we may continue to function as a society and nation.    Anything beyond that is icing on the cake.    I absolutely agree that our Industrial Revolution age, mass production structured education system needs to be revamped, but I don't think that will happen by making it the mission of the schools to find the individuals \\"Element\\" (wouldn't that redefine \\"Elementary School\\"?).    If you're looking for a collection of stories of how people who were \\"different\\" were able to overcome obstacles and create great careers and lifestyles by doing what they liked to do, by all means, buy this book.    Otherwise, let me give you my recommendation for YOUR Element:    Make space in your life for doing what you love, without expectation of reward.  Therein lies happiness.
B0012QCZ54|3.0|All of the dancing movies I've seen so far have been weak in everything but the dancing, and this one is no exception, especially when it comes to the plot and character development.  That might not be a problem for immature teenagers, but anyone beyond that level will strain to suspend their disbelief in the face of the steady stream of flaws this movie presents.  On this basis, this movie is lucky to get 2 stars.<br /><br />On the other hand, I watched this movie primarily because I love dancing, and the dancing in this movie was pretty good - not amazing, but still pretty good.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the dancing doesn't really show up until the final showdown scenes of the movie, and in fact perhaps the best dancing is to be found while the final credits are rolling, as well as in the bonus materials.  Particularly egregious in this regard is putting the JabbaWockeeZ performance in the bonus materials and only showing a small sample in the movie itself.  The director, John Chu, makes the excuse there wasn't time to include this material in the movie, but I don't buy it.  Given that this is a *dance* movie, all of the best dancing should have been included in the movie, and the resulting omission of non-dancing nonsense would have improved the movie, not worsened it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can still give the dancing 4 stars, so 3 stars for the movie overall.  Considering that lukewarm rating, I wouldn't say that I wasted my time watching this movie, but I can't really recommend it either, unless you're able to overlook its weaknesses.
B003QCCS36|5.0|I have been a Ray Lamontagne fan and his new CD is absolutely superb!  Ray can transform you to another place with his beautiful, soulful voice - and the musicians on this CD (the Pariah Dogs) are just tremendous!  Crank it up and really listen to the guitars, drums, harmonica - I can't get enough of this guy's talent, and I only wish there were a couple more songs on this disc.  But I will take what I can get.    Favorites of mine:  God Willin' and the Creek Don't Rise; For the Summer; Rock & Roll & the Radio -   If you have not heard Ray, give this a try - and if you have heard him, you are probably enjoying this as well!  Thank you, Ray Lamontagne!!!
0307454541|3.0|I  thought the plot line was intriguing and I kept turning pages until the last 75 or so when the action slowed quite a bit.  One of the main characters, Lisbeth, is fairly well drawn and interesting, while in my opinion, Blomqvist, was never rounded-out.  The chapter title quotations made it clear that the author wanted to be sensitive to the issues of sexism and the abuse of females, but I still felt that many of the scenes portrayed women as powerless.  For example, the murderer tortured and killed helpless women in pretty graphic detail and all of the primary female characters were EAGER to have sex with Blomqvist.  On the other hand, Lisbeth, manages to empower herself over a man who is abusing her, and does not live a \\"and she lived happily ever after with the prince\\" future, a conclusion that I appreciated.
B0027VSZMA|4.0|Beautifully written.  Intreaguing. Lots of story. Powerful w/o maudling emotion. Love, Divorce, children, social attitudes, survival in early 1900's.

B000HWZ5XI|5.0|I recently purchased all of Robert Plant's cd's after really \\"listening\\" to Principle of Moments, which I had had for years.  I am an old Zep fan in my late 50's, but all of these years, I never gave Plant a chance.  He has done some great music since Zepplin, in fact, I am spending more time listening to him solo than I ever listened to Zepplin.  The music is better written, better played, and more suited to Plant's voice.  No one can replace Zep, but certainly, Plant has gone in a different direction and has produced some excellent music.  There is no track on Mighty Rearanger that I do not like.  It is well worth the money.<br /><br />As usual, Amazon did a great job getting everything to my home as described.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I stumbled upon this by chance and was glad I did!! The acting is great, the scenery and sets are breathtaking. Craig Horner and Bridget Regan do a wonderful job of filling the shoes of Richard and Kahlan and the sparks between them will keep you coming back for more!! The story line will keep you on your toes, if you like fantasy,action, and romance this series is definately for you!! Check it out I promise you won't regret it! : )
0443069522|5.0|I used this book during gross anatomy in med school and found it to be amazing.  The full Gray's is just too long (1400 pages) and not written for a student - it's written for anatomy professors.  It's dense!!  This is much much more readable.  Sure, it has a mistake or 2, but so does the full Gray's.  But for a med student covering the entire body in 10 weeks - this is your book.
B002ZG97RE|2.0|Watching the movie made me realize why I disliked George Bush.  Matt Damon is excellent and  plays his role superbly.  The movie is too dark to enjoy much and the memories of the Bush administration make things even worse.

030726999X|5.0|After reading the three books of the series all summer, I have finished the last one. After reading that Stieg had 10 books lined up for the series, but died having finished three I am disheartened that my new favorite heroine's last book is done. I, like many others had my nose stuck to the trilogy all summer long. I know I am not the only one because anywhere I had an outting someone, somewhere, was reading one of the three, and I hear it's a world wide phenom! So, after reading the exciting ending to the third book, I wish there were more, like the 10 that were planned! That being said. I want to say that I enjoyed the books very much and found all of the characters enjoyable. My favorite was the second, but each one had it's good points. Salender is laid up for a lot of Hornet's Nest and there is a lot brewing at Millenium and a competiting paper. I love how the action flowed through the books, and the character's hooked us all in.<br /><br />I think Salender was a great heroine in all of the books, actually, anti-hero is how the author probably intended, it worked nontheless. I read that a concern for Hornet's Nest could be a cliff hanger at the end, well, I will report that it was all wrapped up in a very satisfying way. I closed the book knowing that things were fairly cool in the life of Blomkvist and Salender, and Erica.<br /><br />Well, I guess I'll get on with my life and be thankful that Stieg had the opportunity to write the first three. And now, I guess we will probably have the movies to look forward to.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|Pale Rider is my favorite western of all time. I know Clint Eastwood won the Oscar for Unforgiven but I didn't thing it was as good as Pale Rider! I've been looking for this DVD for awhile! Found it here, on Amazon, for less than I would've found it in a retailer. Delivery was quick too. I do almost all my purchases with Amazon now!
B001FB55L2|4.0|\\"Brothers\\" is an American remake of an excellent Danish drama from 2004.  As the title suggests, the story centers on two male siblings who are essentially polar opposites of one another.  Sam (Tobey Maguire) is an upright family man and lifelong Marine who has already served one tour in Afghanistan and is all set to embark on a second.  Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a ne'er-do-well ex-con who's released from prison on the very same week Sam is being re-deployed to the battlefield, leaving a wife (Natalie Portman) and two young daughters (the delightful Bailee Madison and Taylor Grace Geare) behind at home.  When news comes that Sam has been killed in a helicopter crash, Tommy is there to help pick up the pieces, leading to some potential romantic complications between him and his brother's grieving widow, Grace.  But that turns out to be only half the story, as anyone familiar with the Danish version already knows.<br /><br />Written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan, \\"Brothers\\" follows the original fairly closely in terms of outline and incident, focusing on one man's attempts to turn his life around after making a mess of things, and another's efforts to come to terms with an action he performed under duress that his conscience will clearly never allow him to live with.  The complex relationships among the three principal players - along with Sam's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - are dealt with in an adult and thoughtful fashion, with a minimum of melodrama and nary a hint of sensationalism.  The conflicts are further exacerbated by the men's father (Sam Shepherd), a hardnosed Vietnam vet whose personal preference for Sam over Tommy has been evident to both boys from very early on in their lives.<br /><br />\\"Brothers\\" reveals its European roots in its more deliberate pacing, its emotional complexity, its lack of judgment towards its characters, and its willingness to leave some loose ends hanging at the end.  Maguire and Gyllenhaal are both excellent as the two torn brothers trying to stay close despite their differences - as are Portman, Shepherd and Mare Winningham as the boys' loving and conciliatory step mom whose calming influence over her husband goes a long way towards ameliorating some otherwise potentially volatile situations.brothers trying to stay close despite their differences - as are Portman, Shepherd and Mare Winningham as the boys' loving and conciliatory step mom whose calming influence over her husband goes a long way towards ameliorating some otherwise potentially volatile situations.
0446581348|5.0|Most women learn how to apply makeup in their early teens and then continue learning new things as they mature.  By the time they are fifty-seven (like I am) they pretty well know their faces, their coloring and what works and what doesn't.  But suppose you started life at age fifty-seven, where would all of your experience be?  This happened to me.  I transitioned from male to female, and there I was with, pardon this, my face hanging out and nothing to put on it!  For someone in my position, Bobbi Brown's Makeup Manual has been nothing less than a Godsend!  I have learned more in the past few months from this book than I ever dreamed possible and instead of looking foolish with bad makeup and no knowledge of how to use it, I have not only learned how to apply it properly and what works for me, but have also gained a great deal of confidence just because I know what to do now.  Thank You Bobbi, from the bottom of my heart.  This book is just THAT GOOD!
1400096936|5.0|I picked up a couple Winslow books years ago at the bookstore, but for some reason I couldn't get into them.  Then I read Dawn Patrol recently and really liked it.  Didn't blow me away, but it's solid crime fiction with grit and humor.    The Power of the Dog, on the other hand, is a friggin' great novel.    It's a worthy depiction of a complex and divisive subject (the so-called War on Drugs), often going into layers of detail that will leave your head spinning.  Winslow did his research in spades and the book is entertaining both as a visceral crime novel and as historical fiction.    Winslow doesn't shy away from the gore and the Americans' complicity in bringing it all to fruition (let's face it, our intelligence community has a filthy history).  The subject may be tough for some to swallow, but as a fan of James Ellroy's American Tabloid, I couldn't get enough.    The only criticism I would offer is that some of the regional patois comes off as a little forced (Mafioso talk, New York Hells Kitchen Irish-American, etc.), but this is a minor point, as the momentum of the novel carried me forward and soon I adapted to Winslow's attempts at different narrative voices.    This is one of the best crime novels I've ever read.  Can't recommend it highly enough.  I just hope I get as much enjoyment out of Winslow's other novels.  I'll be reading them for sure after this.
B00009V7P8|5.0|After debating whether I should purchase the CD or just download the MP3 album, I finally decided to get the CD and I'm glad I did. I have nothing to complain about.
B003QCCS36|3.0|I've been a fan of Ray's since the release of Trouble in 2004 and have been obsessed with him and his music ever since.  However, this album was a complete letdown.  There really aren't any standout tracks.  There are no 'Shelter's, no 'Empty's, and no 'Sarah's. Instead are a bunch of forgettable tracks with no heart or passion.  I waited for this CD for two years and I'm kinda ticked off, to be honest.  It's a shame this will be his best selling album to date considering it's his worst.  For first time Ray listeners: Start with  \\"Till the Sun Turns Black,\\" if you're not crazy about him after that, skip this one.
B0001I561E|5.0|Great film, no skips. Its nice to be able to purchase a Disney film when they are not releasing it.  Great experience.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|They work well for hearing game sound and chat sound.  The only problem is that the mic is quiet and if you have it muted on the amplifier it echos for other players.  I sent it in for warranty repair/replacement and they sent me a new one, still had these problems.  The clip breaks even if you try to be careful, don't expect it to last long.
B00003CXB4|3.0|Good film, but there are a few skips in the middle.  Great show for the whole fam.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Anyone who has ever listened to a Gershwin tune, needs to hear Brian's impeccable musical arrangements and interpretations of these Gershwin classics. The instrumentation, orchestration and harmonies are flawless and Brian's voice, although aged, has not sounded better in years. Over the years, Gershwin's tunes have been covered by many artists in many different styles, but never have they sounded as fresh, clean and CURRENT as they do with Brian's treatment. Brian has not only blended the Beach Boy, Southern California vibe with Gershwin's genius, but he has managed to bring a wide variety of generations together on a musical platform that should please young and old alike. If you like Gershwin, if you like Brian, if you like classic tunes, buy this CD; you will not be disappointed. It gets my nod for a Grammy.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|Was disappointed that the needle was broken when we opened it.  After spending another $25 we were able to enjoy it though.
0452289963|4.0|Every now and then a book comes along that completely changes your life or perspective if you let it, and this is the one. Tolle opens with a look at our own insanity and madness and and proposes that we are at a real crossroads in our existence. Evolve or die. I suggest that many more people sit for an hour or so and just contemplate how mad our society really is. The same minds that create technology to repair the human body also invent weapons to destroy it.<br /><br />The whole premise of why we are the way we are in Tolle's mind is the ego present in all of us. He then gives a very long and detailed look into just what the ego is. Once we recognize it, we can stop its stranglehold on us.<br /><br />This book was meant to be studied over a long period of time with a good teacher. Which is why many people say that its similar to Buddhist teachings. It would have been perfect if it offered a list of excercises to help people to free themselves of the ego, but I think he saved that for another book. After all, freeing from the ego can be a life's work, which is called enlightenment in Buddhism, and its no easy task. I read this book at least once a month and am glad I found it in my life.
B002JG67L4|5.0|Great edition of Coldplay who did not buy that you can buy will not regret it.    Sumaia Mary. Paraíba. Brazil
B0019N8P2W|2.0|5 stars for the show itself.  -0.5 star for failing to mention on the outside of the product--*before* people buy it--that all of the songs have been replaced.  -1 star for not even springing for plot-relevant songs such as R.E.M.'s \\"Everybody Hurts\\"  -1 star for no episode guide.  -0.5 star for unskipable previews.  I didn't pay fifty dollars to be forced to watch advertisments of Beavis and Butthead.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|Why do all the good ones have to come to an end? I loved both Veronica Mars and Cupid (both CW shows). I love the idea of watching her grow up then head off to the FBI. I love relating to her. Found this on Netflix and have been addicted ever since. They should have hulu, NBC, or ABC pick this up and finish it. Or even Marvel or DC. Someone should just pay for it and finish filming it. The crime noir feminine lead here rocks. I can't wait until Netflix and hulu (ie the fans) are the ones who get to choose what airs and what gets cut. That's how Chuck got saved, the fans (and Facebook/Twitter).
B003VB5D84|3.0|I see that my original review was taken down, probably for the better. As I said in that review I did not watch the entire two hour theatre release because I was disappointed with the weak performances and left after only 30+ minutes. With that in mind I can see where my review may lack credibility. Since I have not seen the upcoming four hour release I could not possibly review it for either content or quality.      My apologies to Jimmy Vaughan, ZZ Top and Doyle Bramhall for trashing your performances, I should have waited. Apologies to Eric Clapton for his noble effort which probably deserved better reviews from me and most definitely deserved better performances from the aforementioned.
B003IODNJA|5.0|Finally, a gorgeously restored, masterfully produced, lovingly detailed account of the Dusseldorf band's epic slice of dark, yet beautiful synth pop.  It's truly a shame that this record was largely overlooked in the United States. In the US, you'd think that Depeche Mode had singularly invented this particular style of emotional, deep, brooding, dark electronica... not so, friends. Even what later became Depeche Mode's graphic and photographic style is taken for a test drive here. This was the first release on which now famous photographer Anton Corbijn was allowed to design the entire visual presentation. This album should have been HUGE. One is left to wonder what might have been if the record label, ZTT, weren't entirely consumed by their Frankie Goes to Hollywood craze at the time. This is recommended listening to any child of the 80's that was into alternative, new wave... the stuff that MTV's 120 Minutes was made of.  Thankfully, the album retains it's brilliance even 25 years on. It's a calling card from another time.    \\"A Secret Wish\\" is one of those maddening ZTT releases that was released in many different versions over the years. Different mixes, different edits, different running orders... finally, after 25 years, all of the incarnations of all of the albums tracks are presented in one complete edition.  Lovingly packaged, with detailed liner notes (to help you make sense of all the tracks), and immaculate audio remastering. I couldn't recommend this album more.  As ZTT used to put in the runout groove of their records and other odd places on many of their releases, \\"For Those of You with an Eye for the Finer Detail, We Salute You.\\"    For completists, I also highly recommend picking up [[ASIN:B000B5KRAC Outside World]] and [[ASIN:B00004W4LM Wishful Thinking]], both of which include many remixes and tracks from this same era, but not found on this release.
0141439807|2.0|This is the second time I have read this book, and I just can't finish it.  I purchased \\"Murder at Mansfield Park\\" and had to remember the characters.  Unfortunately, it's just too boring.  I'd like to take Fanny and knock some sense into her.  Tell her to be more human, more tolerant, more likeable.  However, that's how things were back in Jane Austen's time.  Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, were not as hard to get through.  I will not waste my time on Murder at Mansfield Park.
B003SJ4VJ6|2.0|The initial story-telling, and set-up are there - if a bit hackneyed - but it all falls apart into the most predictable and pathetic pay-off. It's an even less plausible \\"Manchurian Candidate\\". The sad thing is, there is no doubt good cinematic territory to be exploited from the relationship between the U.S. and the UK of recent. But Mr Polanski reduces it all to the most laughable of far left-wing European conspiracy theories. Snooze. The most entertaining part thus becomes listening to Kim Cattrall fall in and out of her very bad English accent.
0525421033|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book - which I'm sure I'll be battered a little for, as all the reviews I have read thus far have been nothing but praise!    I loved it's simplicity, it was so easy to read and I was able to completely immerse myself in the story. It too was moving, moving a little too close for home with some recent personal tragedies, causing me to cry and feel personally affected by each of the characters and in particular Mia's loss and choices that lay in front of her.     I loved the detail of the characters and left feeling like I knew them.     Stories should absolutely be left with questions hanging - it makes for interesting writing. However, I did feel though like this was the first 5 chapters of a book and ended much much too soon. It's not a case of too many unanswered questions, but I didn't feel like anything was explored enough, but issues were just touched.     For me, this book had me engaged and had gripped my emotions but it came up a little short and left me wanting more. More emotion, more of Mia, more of seeing the challenge of living out your choices and witnessing a life forever altered but full of sheer possibility. Forman - please write a sequel.
B00065GX1O|2.0|An opera libretto contains detailed stage instructions including settings and scenery. These are an integral part of the composition and complement the singing in conveying emotion. For example, Act I of Puccini's Madam Butterfly (Ricordi, 1906) describes the opening scene as \\"a Japanese house, terrace and garden. Below, in the background, the bay, the harbour and the town of Nagasaki.\\" Whenever an impudent director decides to \\"revise\\" an opera by changing the setting as radically as was done here, there should be a clear disclaimer that this is NOT the original opera. In this production, the wretched scenery and costumes interfere with the music and singing in conveying the emotion. It is a pity because there is some great singing, especially from Dessì. But the only way to enjoy it is to close your eyes and just listen to the music and the singing. In which case, you may as well buy the CD instead of the DVD! Two stars is average of four for the singing and zero for the direction. \\"Mondo reo. Non c'è più virtù. Tutto declina\\".
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have several workout DVDs... to include The Biggest Loser Cardio Max and Power Sculpt (both of which include Jillian Michaels). However, I have to say that 30 Day Shred is the best I own. Jillian is great at motivating me to get through every exercise, at one point telling the watcher to \\"remember why [he/she] bought this DVD\\" and to \\"think about going bathing suit shopping!\\" It's even more great that she has two workout partners behind her that do two versions of the exercise so you know how to modify it if it's too hard. Sometimes trainers will just instruct you to \\"not go as far/high,\\" but Jillian makes it perfectly clear how to take it down a notch. I also enjoy the upbeat music (and the fact that they synchronize the workouts with the music more often than not) and the fact that you don't have to do this workout day every day (if you don't have time) to get something out of it. The only down side to this DVD is that you can't skip through her introduction. I tend to start the DVD and do other things while the intro plays. This DVD is FANTASTIC for anyone of any build or in any shape.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|A few weeks ago, I had the good fortune to be invited to participate in a NASA-sponsored teaching conference at Kennedy Space Center.  We toured the Cape Canaveral Air Station, all the launch sites, and the KSC launch facilities.  Along the way, we met a number of engineers, some astronauts, and Andrew Chaikin, the author of the book this series is loosely based upon.  It was a life-changing experience.  Those of us who remember Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo take for granted the amazing unity and outright fear and joy the whole nation and world experienced during the voyages to the moon.  These events were 40 years ago. Millions upon millions of our fellow citizens have no recollection of these adventures.  Many people don't even believe they happened.  Well, they did, and this collection of videos tells the story in a wonderfully complete, compelling, and human manner.  Watch it.  See for yourself.
B003SJ6W4I|4.0|I don't understand the low rating. I thought this was a very good family movie. This movie has no slow spots and moves along nicely. The humor is great for my 10 year old son. These days it's hard to find a movie that a family can watch together.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I first watched this series when it was released on HBO. I recently had the urge to watch it again, and I purchased this product. Once again, Mr. Hanks and his team deliver an awesome product. This is one of my favorite series, and I intend to wach it again and again.     As a side note, one of the producers is Ron Howard, who brought us Apollo 13, and several of the actors have parts in both movies.     My favorite episode is probably the one concerning the development of the Lunar Module, followed closely by the last episode. They are all really quite inspiring!     You wont go wrong purchasing this series, especially at the current price!
B003B02OOG|2.0|Given that I usually find John Grisham an enjoyable and entertaining read, I was very disappointed in \\"Ford County.\\"  Every story in the book left me with the feeling I was reading an author's \\"working notes.\\" Each story consisted of what felt like notes on character and plot development for some possible future novel.  Each story showed great promise, but in each, at the time when the story should have deepened and broadened (really got rolling), it stopped short. Perhaps a shelved project, not to see the light of day, until all were thrown together as this collection of short stories?  As I said, disappointing and a bad investment.
B000P0J0AQ|4.0|I used this as a teaching tool in my philosophy class dealing with the issue of dualism.  It was excellent for that purpose.  Good movie, too.  If you look deeply into it and analyze it, the movie has a good lesson.

0060899220|4.0|Enjoyable peek into Bourdain's entry into the work of chefs. I really liked his unfiltered eye on behind the scenes of restaurant relationships and personalities.  He does not spare himself either.  Contains salty language, but it just paints Bourdain's character that much brighter.  A recommended read for any person who considers himself or herself a foodie.
B002RKSXJG|3.0|Once you get over the flowery language, this book is pretty good. I gave it a three, because there are several \\"preachy\\" type passages that could have been left out without ruining the story or depriving the character of it's character. I admit I'm an action junky, so I like my books to clip right along. This one keeps you wondering, which of course, keeps you reading. There are several mysteries that have to be solved in this thing for the victim to be avenged. What interest me the most in these extremely old books are the characters attitudes (morals, actions, thoughts), the laws at the time, and the manner of speech. I get tickled at some of the insults, wonder why calling someone a spy is a terrible thing, get lost in the eloquence and amused when a phrase pops out that is considered \\"modern\\". The medical aspect of the book is sometimes amusing (sorry, not a single woman went to her bed with the vapors even though most of them went to bed often for nerves or shocks), and I don't know if the short lifespan of the time was due to the medical profession or the attitude of the sickly. I would like to see a modern writer take this book and re-write it in a modern way, keeping the historical time-frame. Get rid of the flowery language, cut out the unnecessary siliquouses and get on with the story, because, all in all, it's a good story.
B003QCCS36|5.0|This c.d. is so great! It gets better every time I listen. \\"This love is over\\" is by far my favorite, but the songs are so (seemingly) personal and introspective that I find myself seeking out the meaning of every line. I think Ray has become one of my all-time favorite artists with this c.d. I own all his work, and it all hits me every time I listen. Love this man!
6302101743|4.0|Here's a case where the poster or box-cover just about tells you all you need to know. In circa 1900 Mexico, a group of American and Mexican rodeo riders, bullfighters, and cowhands enter a forbidden valley and find a lost world of dinosaurs, \\"dawn horses\\", pterodactyls, etc. Pretty much enough to get you interested - or not - right there I would think. No? Well, I guess a little more detail wouldn't hurt.<br /><br />Basically James Franciscus, fresh off of success in a supporting role in PLANET OF THE APES from the previous year, tries to parlay that into a lead as Tuck, the charming rogue type - the proto-Indiana Jones if you will - who has loved and left T.J., (Israeli actress Gina Golan, dubbed here because her accent was considered too strong), a stunt horseback rider - gets involved with her again when she shows him a tiny horse that she wants to make her new act. Her new partner Carlos (Gustavo Rojo) doesn't much like Tuck, setting up a romantic rivalry that never really goes anywhere. Also there's an archaeologist, Bromley (Laurence Naismith, just the guy for this kind of role, old and veddy veddy British), and a charming kid (Curtis Arden), and a few others. The first 2/5 of the film is really just set-up, pitting the various characters against each other as they vie for the mini-horse - nicely animated by Ray Harryhausen, the real reason to see the film. There's also a blind old Indian seer-woman who warns that the valley is death and of course this proves to be true for one unfortunate member of the party later on.<br /><br />Eventually everybody gets together, quarrels are basically forgotten (too conveniently really) and they head into the valley, where they don't find any more little horsies, but do stumble on a big bipedal dino - close to an Allosaurus in size (5 meters high or so) but looking more like a T-Rex - a pterodactyl, and some other extinct reptilian beasties. They spend a bit over half an hour trying to get out, barely thinking about specimens for science or sideshow monsters for profit, but as they unwittingly trap the Allo on their escape, dollar signs appear again, and the film shifts into King Kong mode (minus the emotional content). The Allo, now called Gwangi, is to be set up as the prime exhibit in a travelling show that will make them all rich - but the Indian seer has been following their progress, and she has other ideas. Gwangi's arrival in the big time doesn't go as planned, as you might guess without my having to tell you.<br /><br />The acting isn't any great shakes here, and the narrative is fairly rudimentary and uninspired for the most part, but really who cares? There's a wonderful Jerome Moross score that is reminiscent of Elmer Bernstein as well as some of Moross' own early work - it's very much a typical rousing western score of the 60s but really nicely done and with a terrific main theme. There's nice cinematography by Erwin Hillier, right at the end of a distinguished career that included other action and adventure films like SANDS OF THE KALAHARI; and most of all there's the great FX work by Harryhausen, whose work is up to its usual standard. The pterodactyl carrying the boy is about as realistic as any flying stop-motion work from that era I've seen, and the climactic sequence with Gwangi in the ring, the town and finally the awesome finale in the cathedral is really marvellous work, and O'Connolly's direction rises to meet the challenge at this point also. This is definitely one of those films with an ending that adds some points to the work as a whole, reminiscent of course of KING KONG but also Harryhausen's earlier 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH.<br /><br />All in all it's a terrific bit of fluff; I would have liked the \\"cowboy\\" angle to be played up a bit more, but no matter really, it's the monsters that we're here for.or sideshow monsters for profit, but as they unwittingly trap the Allo on their escape, dollar signs appear again, and the film shifts into King Kong mode (minus the emotional content).

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This chronicle of WWII provides not only classic battle footage, but also commentary by the people involved in the actions and decicions that shaped events...often the viewer comes to feel that things on the battlefield are not really under the control of major players, but to a great extent, the common soldier.    The bonus DVD on the Holocaust was very harrowing- and as a teacher of Holocaust studies, I'd thought myself inured.    And the narrator to this series: Sir Laurence Olivier
B002ZG9788|2.0|Hi: Movie Buffs  This is a remake of a classic. The adventure is there and the effects do not disappoint, but it is a bit too short! This film leaves you wondering if they had a chance to finish it. It just leaves you wanting more of the story and adventure. This movie is a rental  not a purchase item.
0767821629|2.0|First of all, no computer programme can create REAL people. You need a nervous system to feel anything. In a virtual world, there are no nervous systems. Characters in a controlled universe may act like they feel or know, because that's how they may be programmed. But they will never actually feel or know anything.<br />That's the obvious reason this movie is a pile of self-important but impossible-to-even-consider-taking-seriously crap.<br />Add to that the mindboggling extreme silliness about a character from the virtual world taking the place of someone in the real world, and you really must question: How the hell did this Matrix craze catch on outside of mental hospitals?<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the crime mystery.
B000I5XOVE|5.0|Well..... this is a  movie upgrade for me. I already had this great adventure in collection as a DVD. The upgrade to Blu-Ray was an automatic! This great adventure with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is the continuing saga that captivates the watcher. I highly recommend it to any action adventure fan!
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I loved this film, and have watched it many times.  All I can say is what I already posted in my title.  The story, the cast, the fun, the pathos, the characters. God, I loved this film.   They don't get any better. Oh Tawanda, you're great fun! You're a true bee charmer.   Just remember, the secret's in the sauce!  (Isn't it always?)
B000003TA2|5.0|When I heard Daydream Nation for the first time, I just didn't understand the style and why people would get turned on to it in the first place.  It was a decent album, but Goo is among my top recommendations for anybody getting into SY for the first time.  I hate to use the word \\"emo\\" as it triggers negative stereotypes in people's minds.  But I mean real emotional music, the kind that makes you wanna cry, in a positive sense.  This album is solid all the way through, with Dirty Boots as an excellent opening and my favorite being Kool Thing.  And I love their experimentation with tone and effects in all their catchy melodies.  My next plan is to get Sister, along with their other big hits, but from what I hear you should steer clear from their latest material.
B001615LO2|4.0|This was a very well-received gift for a four-year-old girl. She loves snuggling with it at nap time; it's as furry and cuddly as any teddy bear. The bandolier/purse adds to playtime enjoyment. It has no visible wear or shedding after several weeks of constant hugging. This plush Chewbacca is also an excellent introduction to familiarity with the Star Wars universe, which may be necessary for career advancement in the decades to come.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I usually don't go all fangirl when it comes to adaptations of classic novels, but this casting was delicious - especially Jonny Lee Miller. Mr. Knightly has always been my favorite of Austen's male characters, so I'm picky about who plays him, and JLM was spot-on. I'll admit that Gwyneth Paltrow was hard to chase out of my head as Emma, but after just the second time of watching this, Romola Garai has easily replaced her. And Michael Gambon as Mr. Woodhouse - classic!! Such a great performance by the entire cast!    I also couldn't have been happier with the fantastic adaptation of my favorite Austen novel! I've watched it over and over again since it was on TV, and ordered it here on Amazon the first moment that I could! Love it!
B001N26GFC|5.0|Watch this movie and think to yourself, \\"Who am I MOST like?\\"  Poppy, the main character, or Scott (the driving instrutor)?  Which one can you identify with the most?  Now...Which one do you NOT want to be like?  Or to become?<br /><br />The main character if FULL OF JOY for living.  What is the point of life if there is NO JOY???  Honestly, I keep reading these negative reviews and they're so superficial.  Forgive me, but that's how I feel.  Every scene and every character has a reason for being the way it is.  Trust me on this one.  Just open your minds.  Please.  And remember this...it's a M O V I E.  Seriously.  Some people need to lighten up and drop the BS.  Mike Leigh wrote and directed one of his best films here, and all some people can say is, \\"The main character is so annoying\\".  Wow.  How sad.  Once you have THAT in your head, the rest of the movie will not make any sense.  Word.

This album is what I've been waiting years for, he nailed it on every level. Any Eminem fan, and Rap fan, must get this ASAP.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|The actors did a stellar performance acting out the script as it was written.  Still,  many questions arose in my mind when I watched it.  Why would it have been so shortened?  Why were so many scenes cut out?  If it had followed the book more closely, it could have made for a much richer, deeper plot.  I'm beginning to suspect that it was made into an abbreviated deviation of Wizard's First Rule because the executives in charge of making the decisions knew that the show would never generate enough viewership to justify it's continuation.  I therefore recommend moving away from judging it from a strictly Wizard's First Rule point of view.  Enjoy the show for the riveting action and constant drama.  Don't get too caught up in pointless comparisons.  Of course, my thoughts are only opinions and my guesses are only speculation.  I  can only hope that fans will continue to politely and respectfully campaign for the show's continuation.  If the show was resurrected, the actors would have a fairer chance to complete the seeker t.v. series.  I felt that the show and actors should have been afforded at least 3 more seasons.  Let's rise together and demonstrate that, we the fans, deserve as much too.
B000P7V46C|3.0|Melodic, haunting, but  a bit boring, this album was definitley a drop-off from Wind and Wuthering and Trick of the Tail. Steve Hacketts absence is a major hole in this record, as Mike R. had to pickup where Steve left off. I have it on cassette, and every once in a while ill dig it out for a listen, but I try not to make it a habit. The songs are bucolic and, some might say a bit soft in places. They probably weren't ready to make this as a threesome, but i can feel the \\"transition\\" between the Gabriel-era prog and the Collins-80's pop here. It's okay, but im glad they rebounded with Duke and Abacab!
0545123283|4.0|After having experienced the Twilight series a couple of times, I decided that it was time to move on.  After giving the first book \\"Shiver\\" a chance, I had to read the second book.  Although it isn't as indepth as the Twilight series, it definitely has appeal.  There is some really good chemistry in this book.  It leaves you itching for the third book in this series.  Great light reading.  Overall, very pleased with this series.
1439181780|5.0|My entire day got rearranged when Rhonda Byrne's new book, The Power, arrived. I dropped everything to read it. I have been waiting for her sequel to the global hit movie and book The Secret since 2006. Well, it's finally here.<br /><br />I've liked Rhonda ever since she first called me in 2005 and invited me to be in \\"some movie\\" she wanted to make. She had read my book, The Attractor Factor, and loved it. She said she was creating a movie about the Law of Attraction and wanted me in it.<br /><br />Would I be interested?<br /><br />Not really, and not at first.<br /><br />I had no idea if she were real or not. Many people have wild ideas and big dreams. Most don't take any action, though. But I told her I was open to the idea.<br /><br />Months later I was filmed for the movie. Months after that the movie was released. The rest, as they say, is history. I've gone on national television because of my role in the movie, been speaking around the world, been invited to star in several other movies, and got new book deals and more, all thanks to Rhonda and The Secret.<br /><br />I'm grateful. And I've been just as eager for her follow-up book. When I was on the Larry King TV show the second time, years ago, I announced a sequel to the movie. Rhonda had led me to believe one was in the works. Well, we're still waiting. But today the sequel to the book is here.<br /><br />  And it's GREAT.<br /><br />The Power is about love. In short, when you love anything, you feel different, and you end up attracting more of the same in your life to love. If you can just focus on love, your entire life will blossom.<br /><br />Yes, The Power is about the Law of Attraction. But the book explains LOA in a practical way. It explains the essence of the Law of Attraction.<br /><br />Rhonda doesn't quote any of the teachers from The Secret to prove her points. Instead, she quotes from the legends -- Jesus, Buddha, Einstein -- all dead authorities. None can argue with her. And they all seem to say you can have what you want if you practice love. Well, I agree.<br /><br />It's clear that Rhonda is a fan of Neville Goddard. She quotes him repeatedly. I'm a fan, too, and republished Neville's first book years ago, called At Your Command. Rhonda and I have had at least two dinner conversations where we discussed Neville.<br /><br />In short, Neville taught that if you can feel what you want as if it were already fact, it would become reality. I've written about Neville in The Attractor Factor and other books, etc. He's a hero of mine. Rhonda loves him, too. His message is an undercurrent throughout her book.<br /><br />The Power is an upbeat, wise, feel good read. You wouldn't expect anything less from the wizard behind The Secret. I love the book and will re-read it, give it as gifts, and more. I think it will become a New Thought classic.<br /><br />  But I still take issue with Rhonda's stance that you don't really have to take any action to attract what you want.<br /><br />I was the guy in the movie The Secret stating you needed to act on your ideas. But Rhonda still believes what you want will just come to you if you feel it real. I'm sure for the person who created a movie sweeping the globe, who made over $300,000,000 in sales, and who has been pursued since 2006 for her next projects, that for her it seems like it's all coming her way without effort.<br /><br />But I also noticed that when The Power was getting close to publication date, that emails from Rhonda started appearing. It seemed as if she was waking up her list before telling them she had a book coming out.<br /><br />That, to me, is action.<br /><br />It's also wise marketing.<br /><br />I've seen things happen seemingly without effort, of course. When I attracted my new Spyker car and wanted to be in Heavy Hitters magazine again, I opened their magazine and was surprised to see myself in it. I hadn't done anything. Yet there I was.<br /><br />  Still, it's been my experience that you need to co-create your life.  You are creating in participation with the Divine. You are still needed to do things.<br /><br />The Heavy Hitters magazine didn't have a photo of me and my Spyker (it was of me and my Rolls-Royce). So I wrote to the editor (note I'm taking inspired action) and showed him pics of my Spyker. He then agreed to run a feature on me and my new car in the next issue.<br /><br />In short, I had to take action to attract my goal.<br /><br />Then again, maybe Rhonda is right and I'm just working too hard.<br /><br />Find out for yourself.<br /><br />Go get and read Rhonda Byrne's book, The Power.<br /><br />Its power and message is all love.ve a photo of me and my Spyker (it was of me and my Rolls-Royce).

B002RWKSII|2.0|OK, let's see....Do we dare to add \\"Reimagines Gershwin\\" to a long list of Gershwin tribute albums? That covers a heap of ground from Ella Fitzgerald to Michael Feinstein. Happily, Brian has been more prolific over these past ten years than at any time since the pre-Pet Sounds era. But, to my ears these arrangements are so formulamatic, so \\"Hollyridge Strings\\", so Four Freshman/Beach Boy like. Really how can Brian expect to get away with such an anemic arrangement of \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\". It may take the prize as the worst Rhapsody I've heard. There's just no energy, it's not dynamic, there's no passion. Worse yet, \\"I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'\\" sounds like it was lifted from the BB Xmas album, sleigh bells & all. And Summertime!!! I'm just not buyin' it Brian. I wasn't expecting Janis Joplin, but I think I got Barry Manilow instead. The closest we get to a decent arrangement and nice vocals is \\"'S Wonderful\\". Brian has fun with it, but then he follows it up with a cheasey treatment of \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\". Why the call & response business is right out of a high school pep-rally, (Did I hear \\"Be True To Your School\\" in the background?). I'm just not feeling the conviction and passion that's at the very heart of these great Gershwin classics.     I'm sorry, but I just can't get very excited over this really DULL, DULL and DULLER offering from Brian. It pains me to say this, but I've been waiting a very long time for a solid follow-up to the fantastic \\"Orange Crate Art\\". Sure, I know I sound unkind to a great songwriter, arranger, producer and American icon. There will be dozens of Brian's faithful fans poo-pooing this review. But I just don't find much, if anything appealing here. Frankly, I feel this is a real throw-away, as was Brian's last effort \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\". Maybe Brian needs \\"Someone To Watch Over Him\\". Is there a Dr Landy in the house? Dr Landy!....Paging Dr Eugene Landy!
067101756X|5.0|This is a great book written by a Lt Colonel of the US Army, who had the first hand knowledge of the incredebile story which ocurred on July 1947 on Roswell, New Mexico, and US Military still keeps it under tight wraps. We sure can discuss the outcome (reverse ingineering) of the alien artifacts that were recovered there, but one thing we should never put on doubt is that the Mr. Corso is telling ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH, in his book. Anybody who thinks he wrote this book to make a couple of dollars at the end of his life, after a remarkable military carriere, serving his Country with devotion and integrity, I just .... feel sorry for your level of thinking.  It is so much out there, and so much we don't know, plus do you think that Government would let such a story be known to people, especially with the tendency of our human race for dominion, intolerance and abuse of power.
B0029LHW68|1.0|At some point during a meeting Leto must have commented: \\"Listen fellas, this album sounds great, but I got a fever, and the only prescription is more choruses of children!\\"  I downloaded this back in December and it still hasn't grown on me.  As a fan of the band from the start, this album is a disappointment. It's just too soft and boring. A lot of the songs contain choruses of a large group of people singing (sounds like children) which is the equivalent of 'clapping' in a song to me - very distracting and super lame! Based on this, I'm embarrassed to like this band.  If I could rate this a negative, I would.    When I first heard Capricorn as a college freshman back in 2002 I was hooked and had to get more, so I blasted off to Mars.  That entire first CD was gripping and heavy.  Their followup CD A Beautiful Lie was just as gripping, albeit less raw and more produced.  Hell, I remember the first time I heard The Kill while driving home from buying the CD (incidentally A Beautiful Lie is the last CD I've ever purchased).  It was dark and I was alone on the highway and it was just a really great moment (this is of course prior to The Kill's over-saturation).  There are no moments like that on This Is War.    Subtract all the heavy and/or hooky moments from A Beautiful Lie and add a chorus of children in every song and you have This Is War.
B001FB55L2|5.0|When I found this movie, [[ASIN:B001FB55L2 Brothers]], starring Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Natalie Portman, and also featuring Mare Winningham and Sam Shepard, I had some expectations about it. For one thing, I've enjoyed performances by each of these actors over the years.<br /><br />The cast was wonderful in this poignant depiction of how the war affects everyone in the family, including those left behind.<br /><br />When Sam (Tobey Maguire) returns to Afghanistan, he leaves behind his wife Grace (Natalie Portman), his two kids, his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal), and his parents.<br /><br />Sam Shepard stoically plays the man who believes in the honor of military life, but later in the movie, we catch a glimpse of emotion as he shares some of what he felt after returning from Vietnam.<br /><br />While Sam is away, Grace comes to rely more and more on Tommy.  Especially after the family is notified that Sam's plane crashed in Afghanistan and that he didn't survive.<br /><br />However, we soon glimpse scenes in Afghanistan that reveal that Sam is not dead, but a prisoner who is being tortured.  The horror is almost overwhelming.<br /><br />There are moments back home, though, where Tommy and Grace seem more and more connected.<br /><br />So imagine what will happen when Sam actually returns.  The sudden return is almost as heart-wrenching as his departure earlier.  The emotions, the adjustment difficulties, the effects of the torture on Sam, and ultimately on his family....<br /><br />This was a compelling film that left me thinking all through the afternoon about the high price of war and the emotional after effects.
B00006IRJU|4.0|Yeah, this was a great album. Can't buy it here, can't buy it on iTunes. I don't want to download it illegally. So what's up, record company?
B003JTHESA|5.0|This was not what I was expecting. I doubt many of us fans were. I am also a fan since NOTB which is important to mention (as so many of us do) as it indicates that we cut our teeth on a particular era and have been tried and true fans for many years, lineup changes, ups and downs, what have you. I certainly understand how some have heard this album and been shocked. I was shocked and loved it. Certainly, there are many signs that this is still the Iron Maiden we love, but in so many more colors, shades, shadows, and textures. I would caution you, however, that this is the least heavy album Iron Maiden has ever put out. It still rocks, but there are so many parts that are simply beautiful moments of soaring musicianship, introspection, and expression.     I can't help but feel that this is an album that they have wanted to make for quite some time. It is as if they simply stopped writing material they felt SHOULD be on the album, and just wrote what they felt. After all, these are 6 men in their fifties who no longer need to do anything they don't want to. They seem to have written what came naturally. I would, after all, rather hear a band's honest reflection of where they are in their career, than a bunch of guys trying to sound like they're trying to recapture something. Yes, these are the same carbon-based lifeforms that put out Powerslave, but not in the same time or place. Their musicianship is now at a staggering level as it is reflected on this album. I'm not a good enough writer to talk about all the songs and what they sound like, but I can tell you that they are richer, more layered, more thoughtful, and completely fresh. There are certainly still many passages that remind us that it is Maiden, but the songs reflect an update to their sound and catalogue that many of us have hoped for. It takes a few listens to truly get it, but this is some of the best music they have ever put out. I am a diehard classic Maiden fan and am not crazy about some of the post-2000 stuff, but this album has songs I would actually WANT to hear along with the older stuff.    I am very pleased that you can barely hear Janick Gers in this one. Nothing against him, but he has very few leads in this one and plays predominantly rhythm. His playing is still useful as it elicits more textures and sounds in a much more thoughtful manner. The guitar playing is definitely very Adrian and Dave driven.      I strongly encourage you to pick this one up. Personally, it is one of my favorites and definitely my favorite since Seventh Son. It is such a quality album.    PS. I strongly believe that those who wrote such reviews talking about this not being Maiden, or that Maiden is dead are very much entitled to their opinions. Having said that, I also believe they are only open to hearing one dimension of Maiden and are not very open to change.
B000065V42|3.0|Honey, I Shrunk The Kids doesn't exactly hold up, but it's still pretty fun. The special effects, which are the strongest elements in the film, are stunning to watch and they really help with the story (which is pretty weak at times). There are plenty of silly moments and some impressive sets and effects shots. The music is also good. However, there are two problems I have with this movie. One is that the kid characters are terribly dull. They was nothing distinctive or interesting about them. The other flaw I find in this movie is that the journeys that the kids take when they're tiny aren't very adventurous. I mean, the adventures aren't very imaginative. It's not really exciting to see this kids wandering around in the grass. It would have been better if they had taken a journey outside of the neighborhood.<br /><br />Still, HISTK is fun, and it has some swell special effects. It's not a great movie, but it certainly isn't a bad one, either.<br /><br />Grade: 5/10
B002VECM6S|4.0|The screen writer had no business adding the simulated sex scenes even though it was husband and wife... such was not relevant to this wonderful story, and was embarrassing as a family movie, as was a small bit of the language.   If these two things had not been added, I would have given it 5 stars.--
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I have been a Rush fan for over thirty years. Once I saw the trailer for this movie, I had to have it. It was the finest piece of Rush history I have ever seen. With the vintage concert footage and the interviews of all the guys and comedy thrown in too, it will be a great piece for not just a Rush fans collection but for any music lovers collection.  PS. You have to take the time to watch all the bonus features, they are awesome as well.

0439023483|4.0|I loved this book too but I was shocked and saddened to see so many grammatical errors.  Even if Ms. Collins never learned the difference between 'lie' and 'lay' (two instances of misuse) or that prepositions take the objective case (at least two instances), are there no editors or proofreaders who did?  And this is at Scholastic Press, supposedly the arbiters of all things educational!  There were other errors of usage, which I find unforgivable.  What a terrible example to set for young people in a country that has clearly let learning be put on the back burner.

0141439793|3.0|Northanger Abbey is a classic, but is able to be read with an ease usually associated with light, modern novels. It must be remembered that Northanger Abbey is a parody which can be more difficult that it sounds. Reading Northanger Abbey from a modern viewpoint and taking the action and dialogue seriously can quickly annoy the reader.<br /><br />Catherine isn't very worldly and has learned of the world through the books she has read. When she goes on a trip with her neighbors, she meets Tilney and falls in love instantly. Much goes on in the love lives of all of the younger people in the books, but most obvious is Catherine's utter innocent and naivety. More often than not, her doe-eyed charm is grating rather than endearing.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is best when the characters discuss novels and reading. A lot of debate is put forth as to the worth of fiction and this discussion will strike a chord with most book lovers. Looking at it in a more specific light, this book delves a lot into the concept of the Gothic novel and readers may find themselves completely lost if they have no prior knowledge on the subject. The bulk of the humor stemming the parody aspect of the book is a take on this Gothic theme, so those who don't know the basics will miss this as well.<br /><br />The romance in Northanger Abbey can't be taken seriously, because taken at face value the love story is unconvincing, bordering on ridiculous. While Northanger Abbey feels like a casual read, a lot has to be brought to the novel in order to fully appreciate and enjoy it. While Northanger Abbey provides decent entertainment, those looking for a good Austen novel would fair better with Emma or Pride and Prejudice.

0307269752|1.0|Shrug. Sorry, that's the best I can muster after finishing Swedish author Stieg Larsson's serial bestseller, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". I know, phenomenon like this tend to produce tsunami-wave cycles of popularity, of crest and trough, of adulation and backlash, and back again, pushing opinions to the extremes and drowning out the middle ground. Does anyone find the Twilight series, \\"OK, I guess\\"? How many people finished \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and thought, \\"Ho hum\\"?<br /><br />You can't doubt \\"Girl\\" and the other two books that make up the Millennium trilogy are very much at the peak of the crest now. Last month Amazon announced Mr Larsson had become the first author to sell over one million e-books for the Kindle. The Huffington Post reports that sales of trilogy exceeded 30 million worldwide. But after wading through 500-plus pages of turgid exposition, choppy dialogue and wet characters, the most I can say for this book is, It's OK, I guess.<br /><br />Ho hum.<br /><br />I'll admit, it is refreshing to read a novel set in such a little-known nation, and there's no denying the old-world charm that rises like perfume from place-names like the Furusund Strait, Arholma, Gotgatan and Gamla stan. True, some of the cultural references may be hard to follow, such as those to Sweden's interest rate crises in the early 90s, but in a way that kind of adds to the enjoyment of experiencing something new and foreign. But that's just about the only nice thing I can say about the book.<br /><br />Much of the hype surrounding the Millennium series focuses on its characters, and they are the book's first disappointment, but not its worst. Theoretically, the hero of the story is political/financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, but the publisher knew what they were about when they changed the title to focus on his partner, dragon-tattooed computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (the original Swedish title translates as \\"Men Who Hate Women\\"). It's undoubtedly a smart publicity move, but sadly Salander, billed as a Goth-punk Bourne with an extra X chromosome, instead comes across as yet another fantasy figure, the kind of kick-ass girl introverts dream of dating, one whose real turn-on is diffidence. \\"Dammit, he had treated her like a human being\\" she thinks to herself before hopping into bed with Blomkvist.<br /><br />If Salander is a disappointment, Blomkvist is a disaster. His defining characteristic is passivity. He's accused of libel by a shady businessman, but refuses to defend himself, and is disgraced as a result. Luckily, he's then hired by octogenarian industrialist Henrik Vanger to investigate the case of a child that disappeared 40 years previous, but for much of the book he manages to do little but drink coffee and have sex. Blomkvist's only other character trait, you see, appears to be his alarmingly omnivorous sexual appetite. He sleeps with every single major female character in the book, a list that includes a woman half his age (Salander), the (married) editor-in-chief of the magazine he works for, as well as the (married but separated) niece of Henrik Vanger, a woman much closer to 60 than 16. For Mr Larsson, a journalist, to write about a journalist having such success with the ladies, will probably a too-transparent bit of wish fulfillment for some readers.<br /><br />The other attraction the novel offers is its choice of themes. Here, the situation is somewhat better. The overriding theme, as the Swedish title suggests, is violence against women, especially sexual violence. Each part of the book begins with a grim statistic such as \\"48% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man\\", and this carries over into Blomkvist and Salander's investigation, as they turn up evidence (after much coffee-fuelled bed-hopping) that someone in Vanger's family harbors a serious grudge against the opposite sex.<br /><br />Mr Larsson has other irons in the fire as well. There's his disgust with the cozy ties between financial journalists and their subjects, his hatred of both Sweden's unrepentant Nazi movement and abuses of power, and perhaps more oddly, his airy dismissal of the role of stock exchanges. To be sure, Mr Larsson's rage is evidently heartfelt, though Blomkvist's sudden outbursts against these targets feel as though they come from the author rather than the character. Still, these doses of raw emotion help to enliven an otherwise lifeless plot.<br /><br />The real drawback of the book, you see, is the positively somnolent progress from plot point to plot point. The convoluted backstory could probably have been dealt with in a fraction of the space. We learn a lot about the Vanger family but little that relates to the case. There's a buildup of evidence but no corresponding narrowing of suspects, leaving the reader with nothing to get involved in, but instead watching the investigation at arm's length. Just when the novel feels like it might be suddenly getting interesting--a Dan Brown mystery for grown-ups--Mr Larsson suddenly shifts gears, reveals the culprit and then just as quickly kills him off. The remaining 100 pages are an entirely unnecessary epilogue in which Blomkvist gets his revenge on the man who framed him in the libel case.<br /><br />Partly, I suspect, this long-windedness is the result of the book's rather unique genesis. As most of you will know, Mr Larsson died of a heart attack shortly after delivering the manuscripts of the series to his publisher (this wouldn't sound nearly so eerie if he'd written, say, a work of adult erotica, but hey). So bang went any chance of give-and-take between editor and writer as they sought to hone the work into the finished product. Would you want to delete a dead man's words? No? So that's very much what it feels like we're getting, a raw, unvarnished manuscript, one showing lots of promise but lots of rough edges, too.h Sweden's unrepentant Nazi movement and abuses of power, and perhaps more oddly, his airy dismissal of the role of stock exchanges.

0307454541|4.0|I usually don't read best sellers, but after a friend suggested I try some modern fiction, I dove in whole hog.  I liked Larsson's book and plowed through it in two long settings.  After just finishing three 1930s Euro-spy books by Allan Furst, I found myself doing comparison/contrast.  Both ably take on political issues in Europe, including Nazis away from Europe's main-stage; both paint their scenery well.  Both have lead males who are well loved by the ladies, but Larsson does a richer job building interesting characters.<br /><br />I think I learned a lot about life in Sweden--a country I know little about.  And I probably most enjoyed his thoughtful reflection on the serious battling that goes on today between business and the media.  He also understands modern electronics well enough to nicely incorporate it into the plot.  The murder-villianry was, for my taste, needlessly over-the-top.  Perhaps it was inserted to sex up some future movie deal?  Whatever the case, I'm glad there was plenty of business intrigue left after the eruptions to nicely tidy up the finish.

B0001WTVUW|1.0|I remember watching this when it initially came out in the 80's.  Not knowing what I know now about nuclear war and seeing other films that portray it much more accurately, this movie is not worth the money or time.  Nuclear war would be a nightmare.  In watching this film, it didn't seem that bad at all.  If you would like to see a film that truly displays the true nightmare of nuclear war [[ASIN:B0009S9LNK Threads [NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2&4 Import - Great Britain]]]shows a much more realistic view of what would happen.  You do have to have a DVD player that plays DVD's from Great Britian.  I can only give \\"The Day After\\" one star as none of it seems believable in the light of what information is available online.  Studying it myself made what we were afraid of in the 80's comparable to the film \\"Threads\\", not a Hollywood presentation of what could happen if there was plenty of land left and most people survived without a problem.

0756405890|4.0|I grabbed this book at a bookstore shortly after it was published for a long plane ride. I was drawn in for most of the book with the notable exception of a particular sequence where the protagonist first spends time with his<br /><br />*spoiler hint*<br /><br />presumed love interest. I did find most of the conversations between these two characters unimaginative. Not that the conversations were not witty or even clever at times but more often than not it felt like the remembrances of someone's \\"Oh, I should have said THAT...\\" when they were recalling a conversation from 20 years in the past and their own adolescent romantical fumbling. Believable romance is seldom well done however because who can really explain why two people both of whom are not oneself, get together? Especially in a piece of fantasy fiction where world changing events are wrought by some of the characters. So I can forgive the tepid bits in the developing relationship and even feel they could be necessary to the later parts of the story.<br /><br />Recently I reread \\"The Name of the Wind\\" after encountering many wonderful reviews which made me wonder... It was not a totally unmemorable book but I wouldn't have given it 5 stars even on first read. However some of the criticism seems as if the reviewers simply did not read the whole book or missed some key points in the character development.<br /><br />Contrary to many of the reviewers on Amazon I appreciate a character who seems to excel at many things from a young age. If that character is being set up to be someone who achieves legendary status- why not? It seems more believable than the characters who succeed with a liberal dose of fortuitous coincidences and powerful evil characters acting uncommonly stupid. It is ambitious to attempt to create a character whose presumed success rests in large part in his being more clever than any of his adversaries as that usually ends in a formerly interesting and compelling adversarial character turning into a chump who can't tell left hand from right. An author is often laying claim to quite a bit of his own cleverness when basing a character on a virtue such as cleverness and rarely pulls it off. Rothfuss may have been clever enough to realize the difficulties inherent in such a task and so gifted Kvothe with many virtues other than cleverness to allow the story to unfold appropriately.<br /><br />If anything Kvothe most often stumbles when he overestimates either his own cleverness or the intentions of other character which are better devices than sudden inimical hatred from formerly unknown characters or large, convoluted conspiracies which a character stumbles onto and unravels more quickly than the conspirators can carry out their plot while bumbling time after time in eliminating the protagonist that seem common in fantasy these days.<br /><br />My main concern however is the very weakly developed female characters revealed so far. In some instances Rothfuss even seems to attempt a preemptive defense for why two supposedly strong and intelligent female characters who get into trouble must then be rescued by Kvothe. For most of the story Kvothe is a youth of less than 15 and as such some of his own questionably dense behaviour might be rationalized away as even the most intelligent can succumb to hormones and inexperience. Since the author takes great pains to emphasize the wisdom and relative experience of the female characters compared to Kvothe that they turn out to behave even more dimly is however, inexplicable.<br /><br />Given the sales figures and the legendary status which Kvothe apparently achieves this is only the first book in a decently long series and as such is a good initial effort. It is certainly not perfect but overall the weaknesses of the author are not so large they cannot be ignored if you choose. While the praise for this book is vastly overdone that seems to be the way of the modern publishing business and much of the criticism is undeserved. The deserved criticism could be substantial depending on your own personal point of view but at least for me wasn't enough to ruin one of the better fantasy beginnings of recent years.tial depending on your own personal point of view but at least for me wasn't enough to ruin one of the better fantasy beginnings of recent years.
B00138GZ5W|5.0|I will not ramble on so everyone will think I am clever. I will simply say this is magnificent from beginning to end. This was a landmark album and the songs have influenced and been covered by everyone from Johnny Cash to U2.  It's the Boss stripped down to his bare essence and highlighting what he does best, story telling.  It's an American music masterpiece, pure and simple. I love to listen to this when I drive, windows open, and just cruise. No matter where you are or what your circumstances, whether you are high or low, this album never fails to hit the spot and you simply feel the better for having listened.

0316069906|5.0|Never would I have picked up a book with the title Eating Animals. But I'm a fan of Jonathan Safran Foer's writing so I had to check it out. His desire to know what he was feeding his newborn son and his relationship and love for his dog, caught my attention and in my case, the rest, as they say, is history. I am now a vegetarian after 60 years of being a meat eater. I cried every day that I read this book. The factory farming scenes that Foer describes are horrific and I realized I could no longer be part of such cruelty. Throw in the incredible damage to our planet because of factory farming, and I am fully convinced vegetarianism is essential for so many reasons, including our own physical health. Whether or not it will have this effect on everyone, everyone who is a meat eater should read this book and know where their food comes from and the process it goes through before reaching their table.
0143034901|4.0|When Daniel Sempere's father takes him to a secret library called The Cemetery of Forgotten books it is his first step on a journey to learn the secret of The Shadow of the Wind, a book written by the mysterious Julian Carax.<br /><br />Great opening for any book lover isn't it? And for the most part this Gothic romance/mystery delivers. It is filled with a true love of books and some fantastically imagined characters and twisting plot lines. It grabs you from the start and doesn't let go until the end some 500 pages later.<br /><br />There are so many intersecting plot lines that it is virtually impossible to summarize the story, but in short it is about love, obsession, madness, revenge, loyalty, friendship and regret. It seems as if everyone in the book is hiding something and it is often hard to tell what is true and what is distortion  There are lots of Gothic elements; haunted houses, young girls locked away from the world, dark and stormy nights, secret passages, trap doors and more. The mystery of Julian Carax spans from the 1920's to the Spanish Civil War of the 1950's, from Barcelona to Paris and back again, with copious amounts of detail; sometimes there is a little too much detail with often takes you out of the story, but you are just as quickly drawn back in when another piece of the puzzle is revealed.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story and was thoroughly engrossed in it for a couple of weeks. It does fall short of 5 stars for two reasons; it was overlong, it could have been cut by about 100 pages.  The second problem is I really don't like when books `tell' instead of `show' and the ultimate solution to the entire mystery is revealed in a letter where all is explained and that was the weakest part of the book. Overall I would recommend The Shadow of the Wind, especially if you are fan of good yarns with some old fashioned Gothic creepiness thrown in.
B000077VR3|1.0|I couldn't stand this film.  I walked out and asked for a refund.   After seeing a costume layout for this movie in Vogue magazine, I looked forward to seeing this movie, but I was sorely disappointed. It's dizzyingly fast paced, flash+dash editing made me nauceous.  Not one frame lasts long enough for my eyes to focus.  The songs, many borrowed from other musicals, are presented in half people/ half animation and look ridiculous. It seemed like they couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be.  The screenplay is based on the story of a real life dancer in Paris, but what was a tragedy of real-life  is here  a comic travesty.  Though Nicole can sing, her costar cannot.
B0012GVKW8|5.0|Firstly, the film is one of me favourites! Anytime, I get the chance to see it, I make the time for it!<br />I own the Region 2 Two Disc 2001 Special Edition DVD , which I dubbed the 15th Anniversary Edition, this Blu-ray version & the Ultimate Hunter Version. Now down to the long & short of the matter.<br />In my opinion I prefer the first two media offerings, the dvd was chock full of extras & a DTS track, the first Blu-ray only offered an HD trailer, or so they claimed, & a DTS HD MA track, very loud for my needs! The most recent blu-ray offering, despite the fact that it has all the extras from the 2001 disc & a couple new ones to promote \\"Predators\\", is in my opinion, ghastly & attrocious & makes me wonder what the hell Fox was thinking. Of course, there are people who will say they love it the way it is & the rest of us will prefer the earlier blu-ray version. The point is that prior to HD, all films were shot the way they were & should be preserved as such! To arbitarily scrub the hell out of a film to please one side of the group will have consequences & dissention! I say this, leave it alone! If we want to see wax figures, we will go to the wax museum, not spend such lavish amounts of money to be sorely disappointed!<br />The bottomline here is, & if you a multiregion blu-ray player owner, get this blu-ray & the Region 2 2001 dvd version! Stay away from the new blu-ray offering at all costs!

B001DTPZNY|1.0|If you're a fan of the original Indiana Jones trilogy, save yourself the time and money and skip this disappointing sequel. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg went completely off the mark on this one losing all the essence, spirit, and fun of the previous movies.     Instead of a solidly believable story strongly rooted in historical fact, the audience is force fed an overly elaborate and lifeless story masked in an endless series of special effects and cheesy nostalgic one liners. The Indiana Jones franchise is taken almost totally out of context here and regurgitated as an ill conceived cold war era/sci-fi version of tomb raider.    This movie should never have been made. It was so bad, I actually got up and walked out. In over 30 years of watching movies, I have only done that once before. It's an insult to all Indiana Jones fans.

B002BWP4A6|5.0|The White Ribbon,based as it is on old black and white photographs by Sander of farmers and peasants in rural old German communities,has crisp white and black cinematography and a voice-over narrative by the school-teacher(Christiane Friedel),looking back from his old age,this enhances the archaic aspects of the film.The dominance of the bourgeois hierarchy in charge is emphasised by their titles-Baron,Pastor,Doctor,Teacher,Steward,Farmer-and hence the rigidity of the status quo and the patriarchal Protestantism,with its repressive mechanisms of social control.The children who suffer under this are known by their individual names,but they are at times depicted as a swarming brood of evil menace with the collective malice of psychopathy.The film steps back in time to a pristine world of pre-industrial farmlands,snowscapes,wheat fields,beyond sight or sound of our modern media-bombarded environment in the year before WWI in Eichwald in northern Germany.Though fascism is never directly addressed, we are made aware that the utopian agrarian idyll which formed the basis of so much Nazi fantasy was always a lie.     This is an even-paced film depicting slowly the passing of the seasons. Meanwhile the film's more sinister events -a malicious attack on the town doctor, the death of a farmhand, the kidnap and torture of two small boys - are interwoven with the delicate progression of a relationship between the narrator's younger self (the school-teacher is the closest thing the film offers to a protagonist) and a buxom young nanny, Eva (Leonie Benesch),depicted in a warm,humourous and tender way.The question of who is responsible for the suffering echoes throughout as well as the passage of social maladies over the generations.The film is done in parable form.The narrator says that some of the things he's going to say he heard from hearsay and he doesn't know exactly how true this all of this is... We never really know who committed the crimes,although the teacher thinks that the groups of children are probably the culprits.The narrator is also reflecting on what has come to pass in the modern world from his old age.Hanneke uses deconstruction to show the possibility of many interpretations.We may be seeing the seeds of National Socialism,the Red Army Faction or religious fundamentalism being sown.The evil is symbolic, potential,enclosed in ritual.There is an atmosphere of punishment and abuse from the male elders of the community towards the children and women.The Baroness wants to leave her husband and take her children away from `the malice,envy,apathy, and brutality' of these surroundings.     The films offers us goodness,self-sacrifice and love in the form of a grieving husband,the two young lovers's courtship,the filial bond between a son and his mother,the young boy offering an injured sparrow to his indifferent father to replace the killing of the parakeet by malicious siblings.The schoolteacher is our guide through the tale,but events are viewed from the children's perspective. The scene in which Anna's tiny brother, wandering the house wakefully in the middle of the night, stumbles upon his father and sister together, is a masterpiece of ambiguous horror.The village's young are as much victims as perpetrators.The acts are not those of a `sick person', rather that the guilt is collective, and that the children's rebellion against us is the inevitable consequence of our own actions.There is the idea of innocence being victimised and lost, the displacement of simmering resentment and revenge upon those targets that will not fight back.Hanneke consulted mannuals of child- rearing in the country-side,and the white ribbon was used as a reminder of innocence and a mark of shame.In a Nazi context this symbol could become the yellow star that Jews have to wear at all times or the black armband of the Nazis.The schoolteacher's attempts to expose the seamy underbelly lead to his expulsion.The attacks on the status quo by the children isfollowed by the announcement of WWI.We get the idea that the suppression of small things leads to the outbreaks of wars.' All the big wars can be traced back to all these small ones between all of us. I always try to build models to show the big picture with the small model.' thus Hanneke in an interview.Truth is never simple and everyone is suspect.Hanneke offers his films like wounded sparrows for our gaze.
B00003CXA6|4.0|This movie provides a great overview of this famous three-day battle in Pennsylvania.  It is about the battle with only minor introductory material.  Jeff Daniels is fantastic in this film.  He made a moving speech to a small group of deserters about the reason to fight.  It may sound like an obligatory speech about the abolition of slavery but with Jeff Daniels, it comes of sincere and moving.  There were similar moments from the Confederate side about why they too thought the war was justified considering all they wanted to do was to quit the Union and be left alone with their own country.  If one is willing to set aside the moral issue of slavery (no one should), one could see why the south felt this way.  The film made sure in the begining and at the end that the audience could property recognize and identify the actors in character and the actual historic figures they represent.  It is a very nice touch.  The acting is good with the obvious exception of Martin Sheen playing General Robert E. Lee.  His Lee was wooden, insignificant and not at all the majestic and larger-than-life figure that history has come to recognize Lee.  His poorly done and high pitch southern accent is quite bothersome to the degree of being silly.  It is almost enough to ruin the film's realism.  The movie avoided the bloody carnage that historical accounts have left us.  In the film, the dead and dying are relatively clean cut.  A more modern movie would seek to be more realisitc in this area.  The battle scenes are nevertheless very impressive.  The difficult defence of the left flank of The Little Round Top by Colonel Chamberlain's men and the artillery exchange of the two sides just before the start of the Pickett's charge on the last day were both very fine battlefield scenes.  The scenes depicting the consecutive firing of the large guns just before the charge are very impressive.  The film does provide and excellent overview of the battle of Gettysburg.  I highly recommend it foranyone about to visit Gettysburg or after you have done so for a visual review of what you have learned from your visit.  It is also for those who appreciate Jeff Daniels as an actor.

B003JTHESA|5.0|I remembered seeing Janick in one interview, I think it was in Flight 666 album, where he calmly said something like, 'if you like our songs, God bless you. If you don't, you know what, God bless you too'. Very wise, Janick. So cool down, guys, whether you like the album or not.    Maiden has been on the road for 30 years and the band has been exceptionally established. They have huge fans all over the world, they don't need any silly and aggressive promotions to create demands. The music speaks by itself. So, having said that, I agree with some reviewers who said they did what they want, music-wise, in this album. The tracks seem very natural and really explore the band members' skills and talent. I love all the tracks. It is as if I even found what I've been looking for in The Man Who Would Be King, When The Wild Wind Blows, and The Isle of Avalon. All songs are original and deep. I can't say much about the intricacies of the riffs because I'm not an expert (just a good listener for 30 years) but all songs are definitely awesome. Iron Maiden is very extraordinary. They bring progressive music to a higher level. Definitely worth buying the album.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|Team America: World Police Uncensored and Unrated (2004)<br />This film is everything I expected to be since it was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It's very obscene, vulgar, witty, grotesque, purposely cheesy, and humorous. I hope young children do not come across this movie and watch it. It's very violent and sexual. It's definitely for a mature audience. The scene where Gary and Lisa have sex was so long and over the top, which made the whole thing funny, but I found it gross at the end. Also, the scene where Gary is drunk and depressed outside of the bar is gross. Was the length of that scene necessary? I get it: he can't hold his liquor. But that's Trey Parker and Matt Stone humor. How could I expect less? This movie does well in targeting everyone surrounding the involvement with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, such as the celebrity activists, etc. This movie took a serious issue and tainted it all with sarcasm. I think it wouldn't have worked with anything but puppets. The puppets were the key to making this work. They made everything silly and satirical. The fight scenes reminded me of MTV's Celebrity Death Match. The first, I guess you would say: fist fight, was funny due to the limited mobility of the puppets. I found it funny that Team America kept using the word valmoriphication to embellish the transformations of Gary and the limousine. The soundtrack, pure filth/knock offs, but I find some humor in it. The funniest song was Montage. I liked that one. All the others are crude and offensive. Nice job with the patriotic country songs though. The battle scene with the Koreans in the jets over the water reminded me of some scenes in the SpongeBob Square Pants series. They were created the same way. A few details of the movie can be referenced back to South Park. Details such as, the puppet of Matt Damon saying only his name like Timmy does in South Park. My overall rating for this movie on a scale from one to ten is three. I didn't think it was that hilarious as it was meant to be, just clever.us as it was meant to be, just clever.
B001DEAAIY|5.0|I'm not going to review the actual movie Band of Brothers....I think everyone has.  Through the reviews you can gather, it is one of the most well scripted and acted movies ...hey Spielberg and Hanks?...can't go wrong. This is a movie that requires multiple viewings to truly appreciate and under the friendship between young men thrown together through war.     I'm reviewing the Band of Brothers UK Bluray.  The movie itself was the same as the US version.  There were differences in the menu selections, but nothing affecting the movie itself.  I have to say I got it from BluFlicks and they were fantastic!!!! Arrived on time and well packaged...I'd buy from them again and consider saving $30 dollars to get the UK version of a movie.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Iron Maiden's new studio album entitled The Final Frontier is a must for all Iron Maiden fans.<br />This is the group's first new studio album of all new material since 2006's A Matter of Life and Death and was indeed well worth the wait as Iron Maiden (lead singer Bruce Dickinson, guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith and Janick Gers, bass player Steve Harris and drummer Nicko McBrain) plus longstanding co-producer Kevin Shirley helping out again delivered an album that is IMHO a cross between Seventh Son Of a Seventh Son and Brave New World. The one star reviewers bellyaching and complaining about Kevin Shirley \\"ruining\\" Iron Maiden should stop crying (he's no Bob Rock). There must be a reason why Iron Maiden has worked well with him over the last decade (then again ask Jimmy Page who used Kevin for The Black Crowes and Jimmy Page Live At the Greek album and the re-mixing of Led Zeppelin's live releases in last ten years). Iron Maiden's new album also is nothed that it was their first album to be recorded at the legendary Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas since 1986's Somewhere In Time (where they recorded that album's bass guitar and drum tracks and also recorded their classics Piece of Mind and Powerslave at that same studio).<br />We kick things off with the unique two part opener \\"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier\\" (written by Smith and Harris). This over 8 and a half minute epic kicks off with over four and a half minutes of an eerie piece of futuristic, space-like \\"Satellite 15\\" which is the freshest Iron Maiden opener since \\"Moonchild\\" on 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son with effects of guitars, drums, vocals and so on. Then at the 4:40 mark, \\"Satellite 15\\" gives way into the album's title cut and a killer tune it is. Next is the album's first single \\"El Dorado\\" which is a superb rocker penned by Smith/Dickinson/Harris. We follow on with another great tune out of \\"Mother of Mercy\\" which is again penned by Smith and Harris. Then it's \\"Coming Home\\" which is a nice mid-tempo tune penned by Smith/Dickinson/Harris. Next is the superb three harmony guitar approach used nicely on the Gers/Harris/Dickinson collaboration \\"The Alchemist\\".<br />Next is the first of three nine plus minute tracks out of \\"Isle of Avalon\\" which is superbly penned by Smith and Harris and what a stellar epic this song is and a great piece. \\"Starblind\\" follows and is another great Maiden number penned by Smith/Dickinson/Harris and a killer song in typical Maiden fashion. \\"The Talisman\\" is next and written by Gers and Harris. The song starts out like the song \\"The Legacy\\" on 2006's A Matter of Life and Death started and becomes a stellar nine minute epic at a much faster and better pace than \\"The Legacy\\" on the previous album did. Next is \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" written by the two original Maiden founders Murray and Harris (the only two Maiden members who have done every Iron Maiden album). This is another great piece and a great song. We close with the longest track with Bruce Dickinson on lead vocal since \\"Rime Of the Ancient Mariner\\" entitled \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\" and written by Harris by himself. What a great epic and best album closer IMHO since the title cut to Fear of the Dark IMHO as it's similar with Bruce beginning and ending the song singing in the low registers of his voice (which got better as he got older) and musically is reminiscent to that track.<br />The Final Frontier is an Iron Maiden album that is as good as many of their classics and (believe me, as I've been a fan for 22 years) the rock album of 2010 IMHO! To those who are crying, complaining and so on, either listen to your old Maiden albums to relive your youth or go listen to \\"the Porky Pig of rap\\" Eminem or those skanks Gaga and Britney and leave Maiden alone!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ch is a nice mid-tempo tune penned by Smith/Dickinson/Harris.

B003CFBQBW|2.0|I received the CD and it was a poor attempt at fooling the customer.  It was made out of someone's home with a cd burner and poor quality printer.  The sound of the CD was distorted and after realizing that it was fake, I couldn't get past it.  I ended up buying it at Target for 9.99.  If it doesn't bother you that you are buying something that is falsely advertised, then go ahead.
B000002VRZ|4.0|Southern rock always contained some country in it, but the amount varied with the band.  The Allman Brothers had only a tad and were more oriented towards blues and jazz.  Lynyrd Skynyrd had a bit more country, but they were more of a straight rock band.  With Marshall Tucker and the Outlaws the country influence becomes more apparent.    This album is a great showcase for both sides of the Outlaws.  The band's reputation rests upon its classic guitar songs, such as \\"Green Grass & High Tides\\".  The country ballads, however, are not throw-aways, and are more \\"country\\" than what you can hear on the radio nowadays.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King movie itself was absolutely awesome, I don't think many people will argue with that.  It holds a lot of childhood memories and just general good memories. Most people want to share this with their kids, grandkids, the next generation so to speak.  However, I noticed an alarming amount of people leaving a bad review of the movie in effort to warn other people about the bootleg problem that this product is apparently suffering from.  If you plan to purchase this, please note that AMAZON is not selling it.  It's only available through SELLERS (vendors). Please, PLEASE, click on the NAME of the SELLER before purchasing from them.  It will bring you to their main page, where you can check their feedback score and see other buyers' comments.  Do not purchase blindly.       If you have purchased it and have a problem, please follow these steps.      You need to click on \\"Your Account\\" at the top right hand corner of your screen. The first box should say \\"Your Orders.\\" There are two columns of links in this box. Under the second column, \\"More Order Actions\\" is \\"Leave Seller Feedback.\\" It's the fourth link down. You need to click on that and it should give you the option to leave feedback for that particular seller. Please, let other people know. Once a seller accumulates so many negative feedbacks, it will drive their overall score down and people will be less likely to buy from them. Only people that have actually bought from the sellers can leave feedback and within a certain amount of time (I think it's a 30 day limit or so). Also, a negative feedback on their seller profile is MUCH more likely to get some kind of reaction from the seller (because you will still have the option to change the feedback should they resolve the issue). Their score basically determines the likelihood of them getting repeat and new buyers.    The Lion King itself is in the Disney Vault again (which is why Amazon is unable to sell it).  It's rumored to be available again next year.  Until then, your only option is to buy it from others and with it's popularity, the likelihood of getting a bootleg copy is rather high.  So, please check out the seller before purchasing.      To wrap this up, I would like to bring it back to the actual movie review (which is what this section is for) and say again that The Lion King is a wonderful movie and one of my favorites and highly recommended for families.  It really is \\"family entertainment.\\"
044656740X|5.0|The principles outlined in Rich Dad Poor Dad are blatantly obvious.  Most will read this book and think to themselves: \\"Duh! Of course you want to handle your monetary affairs that way!\\"  The fact of the matter is, however, that the vast majority of people fail to follow these few simple rules.  Reading this book will cause readers to take stock of their lives, and motivate them to get their financial houses in order.  Following the rules set forth here will put an end to many previously unidentified bad habits that may be draining your bank account right now. I give it five stars because it did more to steer my way of thinking towards money consciousness than anything else I've ever read.
1591843162|4.0|Seth Godin es probablemente uno de los autores m&aacute;s longevos y prol&iacute;ficos en el &aacute;rea del marketing, las empresas y los negocios.<br /><br />Desde hace m&aacute;s de una d&eacute;cada, Godin ha estado sacando un hit tras otro: \\"Tribes\\", \\"Purple cow\\", \\"Small is the new big\\" o \\"All the marketers are liars\\".<br />Hoy, su nuevo trabajo, hereda esta rica tradici&oacute;n y vuelve a situar al calvo entre los top 3 de los ranking.<br /><br />Linchpin es un libro distinto. En el cual Godin hace un repaso por la historia, explica como funciona la mente humana, la mente de las organizaciones y como el paradigma ha llegado a un borde donde exige un nuevo tipo de personas: Los linchpin, o individuos que a trav&eacute;s de su trabajo (o arte) son capaces de generar v&iacute;nculos o nodos de trabajo.<br /><br />De la misma forma, Linchpin anuncia el fin de las empresas tal y como las conocemos: Desgastadas, poco atractivas, l&uacute;gubres y \\"chupa vida\\", las empresas se parecen cada vez m&aacute;s a un castillo embrujado y no al lugar agradable que debiese ser.<br /><br />Eso hace de este un gran libro: Pareciese como si el mundo de las empresas estuviese contra las cuerdas, enredado, atrapado y congestionado con personas que s&oacute;lo se comportan como mecanismos intercambiables y prescindibles. Es ah&iacute; donde aparece esta casta, justo entre los jefes y empleados. Los linchpin son personas que pueden y quieren entregar mucho m&aacute;s de lo que deben.<br /><br />Godin plantea que a trav&eacute;s del tiempo, las personas hemos sido adoctrinados para escuchar, asentir y obedecer. Desde el colegio nos han pedido que no rompamos los moldes, que entreguemos las tareas sin cuestionarlas y que siempre cumplamos horarios.<br /><br />Si bien Linchpin no es una formula paso a paso para cambiar nuestra forma de ser y transformarnos en artistas emocionales, Godin hace hincapi&eacute; en los errores que solemos reiterar y todo el mundo que se empieza a abrir una vez que empezamos a trabajar bajo otro prisma.<br /><br />Lo que m&aacute;s disfrute del libro es la propiedad que tiene para mantenerse con nosotros. La teor&iacute;a principal es sencilla de asimilar (quiz&aacute;s no de llevar a la pr&aacute;ctica) y la pluma de Godin lleva tanto tiempo trabajando que se ha vuelto amena y con gran ritmo.<br />\\"Linchpin\\" es una lectura recomendada para personas de cualquier &aacute;mbito. Imperdible y abordable. No necesitas estar inmerso en ninguna industria en particular para absorber y devorar las hojas del libro.<br />PEACE OUTs.

B002JODUI4|5.0|I enjoy electronica music, and have for at least the last 10 years. It's a manufactured type of music constructed largely with the use of computers, synthesizers, drum machines and even some acoustical instruments. Some old-fashioned music lovers feel that nothing but purely acoustical/vocal music using actual instruments/voices is the only true music. Well, so what? I'd say that almost any interesting and amusing sounds put together in a structured manner and played for the enjoyment of an audience might rightfully be considered music, and electronica is just exactly that. Some of the composers are artists and musicians second to none and I strongly suspect that electronica will become an ever-increasing fraction of the total musical output.<br /><br />So, if I enjoy this type music, where might I go to find interesting sources of information regarding such music? There are many sources and word-of-mouth is probably one of the best. Well, I'm 76 and rarely go to hip concerts dominated by young people and, likewise, I'm not a part of the club scene nor do I know friends who enjoy this stuff. They think I'm a bit eccentric. So be it. Let's face it, people of my age just don't listen to electronic music. If I attempt to discuss it with them I draw nothing but blank stares. My wife (31) likes electronica and we share quite an overlap in listening to electronic dance music, but her tastes tend to lean more toward electro-pop and bubblegum, whereas I'm more interested in the hardcore electronica dance music. My best source of purchasing information has been the Amazon computer. It analyzes my past purchases and wanderings and offers interesting suggestions for what I might enjoy. I've found some excellent recordings in this way. A second source is listening to my XM car radio where I'm partial to the BPM dance channel. That's where I discovered deadmau5 (pronounced deadmouse, and the lower-case d is intentional). I heard a few songs from the \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" CD and I ordered it the next day.<br /><br />The deadmaus5 CD is an excellent recording and I've enjoyed it very much. Supurb! It's real beat-heavy stuff with a wonderful and highly varied rhythmic background. The sound is crisp and clear and nicely mixed. Voices and vocals are a minor part of the total recording except on a few of the early tracks. In some places, deadmau5 uses voices somewhat like strange musical instruments. Plus, there's all sorts of other strange sounds. You just have to get used to this electronic stuff. In some places the mood is gloomy and funeral like, but even that is fun. It's excellent dance music, that's for sure, and fun to listen to also. I'd say the listening experience in some places is closer to listening to some types of classical music than popular music. Just blot out the heavy beat in your mind, if you can, and listen to the background. It's marvelous! Some people call it Progressive House or Electro House, but I disdain using these micro-genre classifications. It's quite excellent quality electronic music, that's what it is, and it shows a lot of talent and musicianship on the part of those who put it together. Joel Zimmerman is the lead perpetrator. Bravo! I guess deadmau5 has been given and nominated for a bunch of awards, and that's easy to understand. One listen to dedmau5 music is all it takes. I'd say that it vaguely reminds me of some of the early music of Matthew Dear ond Daft Punk, two of my other favorite electronica composers. Sorry, I really don't have any other comparisons. \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" is just an excellent album and stands alone in my book and I now own all of the major deadmau5 CD and DVD recordings. I've become a fan!<br /><br />The sound quality of this CD is exceptionally high, but to fully appreciate it you'll need to have good playback equipment. I have a 100-watt per channel stereo with 7 speakers including two 12\\" woofers and an 80-watt powered subwoofer. I like to play the CD at fairly high, but still comfortable, volume. In that way, I feel the dramatic bass and the higher notes come across as light, delicate and playful. My system is minimal. If you ever get the chance, play this CD on a high-end system. It's just awesome!<br /><br />Gary Peterson<br /><br />Note: I gave this review a minor revision on 1-11-13 and I'd like to  thank all the wonderful deadmau5 fans who have contributed to the extended discussion. It beats anything I've ever turned out, believe me., but still comfortable, volume. In that way, I feel the dramatic bass and the higher notes come across as light, delicate and playful.

0553381687|5.0|I have to admit, though this series was highly recommended to me, I wasn't expecting it to be better than your average \\"genre\\" series. Much to my enjoyment, it was one of the better books I've read in the past few years.<br />Many of the storylines, backstories, characters, settings, etc are all things you'll recognize--loosely based on real medieval families or fantasy stories you've read before, however it still manages to be fresh and exciting and tell a saga you're absolutely eager to race through.<br />While graphic and sometimes a bit pulpy--it's not at all cheap--rather just pretty unsentimental and hard--which to me makes for a great story, especially in context of an epic.<br />I have yet to read the next 3 books in the series and I hope Martin keeps this same level of dynamics throughout the series--regardless, this first book is definitely worth the read. highly recommended.

1601252463|5.0|A quickie review: I was one of the Pathfinder diehards that could not wait to get his hands on this product. In the end I was not disappointed; it is, like most of their stuff, topnotch in both quality and content. I like many of the new spells, Feats, and classes. Not all of them, mind you, but most. Of note are the new Witch and Alchemist classes, as well as new character options for both different races and the original character classes (i.e. Fighter, Rogue, et al)    The problem? The editing could use some work, and more than once certain character class entries had confusing or poorly worded sections in regards to powers or abilities. Also, I am concerned that this is the start of exactly what destroyed D&D 3.5 in the end: excessive power-creep and a glut of unnecessary character and prestige classes. Really, there are more than enough races and classes in the Core Rules to handle any sort of character build you have in mind. Let's try not to go down that road again, shall we?    Still, a must-have product. Buy this now!
B001TH16DI|4.0|Bonus Disc, Captain's Summit: Hilarious! Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart and Frakes with Whoopi Goldberg as moderator, exchange opinions, experiences and anecdotes. Worth the price of the set! Sort of.    Mini-Movie criticisms. ST 1: Once you're over the initial \\"wow, together again\\" excitement, it suffered from a desire to whip Star Wars at it's own game (and failed mainly from bad pacing), and borrowed too much from the Original Series theme \\"machine in search for its Creator\\". ST 2: Best of the bunch, but why couldn't they beam the Genesis device into the Transporter and hold it's pattern?  ST 3: Very UNDERRATED! Kirk deals with so much loss here. FINALLY, it took 3 movies, but we see Kirk fighting in hand-to-hand combat! McCoy's \\"link\\" to Spock, was a brilliant and poignant touch. Plus Sarek! A focused tribute to the characters, rather than another alien encounter. ST 4. Save the whales? Yes, with a humorous knock on the 20th century. At least this time they filmed in the real outdoors (San Francisco). Then again, the basic premise of an alien probe, associated with Earth's past, and threatening the Earth, rescued by the Enterprise crew, was done in the first movie. ST 5. The weakest, and full of hokum, but not a total wash out. Best scene was the \\"share your pain\\" of Spock and McCoy. At least this film *attempted* at Star Trek's original theme \\"to boldly go where no man/one has gone before\\". ST 6: A decent final film. Cold War Ending parable, complete with Chernobyl. Plus two great actors: Christopher Plummer and David Warner! No seeking out new life, but politics centered on a Federation conference. It's also a back story to a Next Generation storyline when the film was initially released.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|If any guitarist has only enough money to buy one music dvd this year, it should be Tommy Emmanuel--Center Stage. His technical skills really need to be seen as well as heard. If anyone is not familiar with Mr. Emmanuel, prepare to be completely dazzled.There is not one wasted minute on this concert and he is certainly one of the guitar masters. Total enjoyment.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I can't remember when I've enjoyed a series as much as this.  I never saw anything  advertised for Firefly on TV????  What's up with that?  I was just browsing Netflix and saw this staring one of my favorite actors Nathan Filian (I Love Castle) so rented it.  To my utter surprise, I fell in love with the movie/series and all of the characters.  I am so surprised that this show got cut because it has all the right stuff....action, adventure, comedy, love etc.  Not to mention that all the actors are superb in their rolls. I bought the Series and then a friend told me about the \\"Serenity\\" movie.....well I now own that too.  Wish it hadn't ended so quickly, I want to know what happened next!!!!

B002KKCWN6|5.0|These are my third pair of Teva. I still use my first pair (10 years old) to mow the lawn. The only reason I had to buy this pair was because our new dog eat my second pair (7 years old). Teva has made a lot of improvements in 7 years, these are very comfortable. Little tip, I like to buy a size up with Teva they seem to run a little small. Bottom line, costly but last forever.
1573229725|5.0|To reduce this Victorian style tour-de-force Dicken's would be proud masterpiece to the label of lesbian fiction does a great disservice to the incredible talent that is Sarah Waters.  Yes, the two main characters in Fingersmith are lesbians, but more importantly, they are thieves, victims, pickpockets, connivers, lovers, and a dozen other complex and intriguing character types that make this book such a compelling and intriguing work.<br />  The story starts off in the back alleys of London- that dirty, seedy, criminal underbelly of a bustling city where the ability to survive depends on wits and quick thinking as much as it does on luck.  A plot is hatched among a handful of life long petty thieves to aim big and go for more than the meager earnings from a day's work of pickpocketing and petty thieving.  Young Sue Tinder is convinced to play a major role in the lengthy scam, moving into the country in the guise of a maid to befriend and ultimately betray a more well to do young lady.<br />  To give away much more would ruin the sheer surprise and unpredictability of this Waters' masterpiece.  Let's just say that the old adage, \\"One good turn deserves another\\" applies, and just when the plot looks like it is safely headed in one direction, it turns around and heads in the exact opposite.  There is no honor among thieves in mid-nineteenth century London.<br />  This is Charles Dickens at his best written with the sensibility and intelligence of a late twentieth century woman.  Lesbian fiction? Yes, but it is way more than that.
B003JTHESA|1.0|To answer another reviewer, You don't have to listen to an album several times to know you don't like it. This is not Iron Maiden. Sure the members are the same, but it's not the music people think of when they think of Iron Maiden. They really haven't had a decent CD since Janick Gers joined the band and probably won't have another decent one until they get rid of him. He's a terrible guitarist and spends all his time on stage pretending he's some kind of guitar hero instead of trying to do any justice to the classic Iron Maiden songs. While They seemed to make an attempt at bringing back some of the things that made Iron Maiden such a great band in \\"A Matter of Life & Death\\" it still fails for the most part. It seems that their music has just lost all the energy that it used to have. I saw in an interview where they said that they are trying to now use the \\"gallop\\" in their music any more, but this is one of the things that made Iron Maiden's music so great. It's in all their classic songs. It's like Yngwie Malmsteen saying he's not going to have guitar in any of his albums any more.     For the record, \\"the reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\" is a dull boring terrible song. they should be ashamed of putting this on one of their albums. It's almost as bad as \\"bring your daughter to the slaughter\\". Iron Maiden is dead, the name may live on, but the music is a dessicated corpse that makes \\"Eddie\\" look like a youthful child.    (I originally tried to post this as a comment, but it got cut off because it was too long)

B0018PJEYY|5.0|I saw the Moody Blues perform shortly after A Question of Balance was released in the U.S.. The opening act was The James Gang whom had just released Rides Again.   Now... here is my question: Late January in 1973, my father and I were watching television when suddenly what we thought was a commercial came on screen. It was a jet fighter flying through beautiful sunsets and landscapes and the music playing was the whole uncut version of Dawning is the Day. After that, there was one minute of silence, then the program on T.V. resumed.   Did anyone else see this? My Dad still talks about it this day (He is 84) and laughs because he saw the first MTV video before MTV even existed.

All the while I was very entertained by the amazing music, Abraham's portrayal, and Hulce's hilarity just made for an amazing film.  By the time Mozart is driving his wife crazy, you're almost on the edge of your seat wondering if you'll be losing it anytime soon.  While the picture quality isn't on par with the latest the studios have to offer, it is the best this film has ever seen and sounds amazing.

1563894696|5.0|Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. What's there not to like? The story takes place in the Year One era with the same mood and look. Tim Sales art is superb throughout the whole book and really brings out the Dark Knight's use of the shadows and fear to take down the city's less desirables. From the first murder on, Jeph Loeb has you eying everyone as a suspect(which is pretty much a prerequisite for murder mysteries, right?). This book hits on the early interactions of Batman and Catwoman, shedding some light into their relationship. They also dive into the story of Harvey Dent which was a character in Year One that was used but not expanded upon.  In all, there is not much action, but that's not why I wanted to read this. The action that happens, though, is great and highlights Batman's swift and great command of the martial arts and the night. I highly recommend this but it would be more enjoyable if you read Year One prior to this as they are both set in the same time. It is not crucial to read [[ASIN:1401207529 Batman: Year One]] but it will add more depth to the story.

1401223176|5.0|Jeph Loeb again delivers a great story and with the help of superstar artist Jim Lee, we have a winning combination. The story has all the great supporting characters in the Batman world. The main villain uses the secret of Batman's identity to strike at him where it hurts the most; the people he loves and trusts. With old foes acting unlike their usual selves he is forced to rethink his lone wolf ways and asks for help from friends and one that has been absent from his life for a long time. While he knows Catwoman's true identity, she doesn't know that Bruce Wayne and Batman are one and the same. This is highlighted when he is forced to examine his relationship with Selina/Catwoman, in light of recent events. Batman must recognize his true feelings for Selina and if he should finally reveal to her his secret identity, but can he really trust her?
B002ZG980U|2.0|Being a big fan of \\"mindbased\\" scifi and having seen on all the hype about this movie I was quite keen to see this movie. Let me clear one things first, the special effects are impressive and if that is important to the viewer they wont be disappointed.<br />If however you like a good story line, complex characters, good acting and want to leave the theater having had your boundaries challenged this will be a let down. Leonardo di Caprio as usual delivers a solid performance but that is about what can be said about the acting. Michael Caines role is so minute that it seems he was mainly included for his 'movie poster value' and most of the others left no impression at all.<br /><br />Particularly Ellen Page disappoints playing the young 'super student' recommended to the project by father in law Caine. She lends no depth to her character and looks mostly like a 16 year old high school student totally misplaced in the plot.. and her character is outright damaging for the overall impression of the movie.<br />Whether it is her character that lacks substance or it is Page who fails on delivering the intended complexity is uncertain but the end result is very damaging for the movie. In general the movie lacks characters and while the overall 'headline' plot is interesting the subplots do not fail to deliver.. they are simply not there.<br />The action scenes are professionally done but as pointed out by others they leave the viewer shrugging their shoulders as the 'villains' are really not relevant to the plot as they are mere projections and seem to drop dead 10 to each bullet while being unable to even hit the target even when outnumbering the hero's 20 to 1.<br /><br />The idea of mankind at some point being able to enter people's mind through their dreams is both intriguing and likely to one day be possible and as such is a good premise for a story. The message to us all to live our lives and not 'get too preoccupied' in our most unrealistic of dreams also makes sense but that's it. It could have gone so much further but it does not. Personally it does not come close to the depth of Vanilla Sky which I found thought provoking even having to endure Tom Cruise for close to hours.<br /><br />Not wanting to give away any of the plot considering there is so little of it (!) I encourage only those who are into scifi and action movies for 'technical reasons' loving good stunts, special effects and action for actions sake... if you are looking for a deep story line, complex characters, good actors and something that stimulates just a bit of thought this is not the movie to visit.ld have gone so much further but it does not.

B003KRJNBW|3.0|Tres Mad Max, though without Tina Turner. Lessee. Strong Mad Max clone. Denzel playing the part of Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson eventually showed himself to be a religious zealot. Now, Denzel is openly playing a religious zealot in this film. I hope he doesn't continue down the Gibson road. Just look @what a train wreck Mel's life has turned into. Denzel: don't move to Malibu. Also, stay away from the sauce!!     Oh, as an aside. The film style is minimalist. The style will register w/a small number of viewers. The character development is also too little, too late. Those two factors are why this film flopped when it was released. I like Denzel & Gary Oldman very much. They couldn't save this film, though. Were it not for them. I never would have finished watching it. Very unrealistic pistol craft, wound survival, & general small arms work. That's the way w/most films, though. It's a pity there apparently aren't many directors who have ever fired a weapon...
B000063UR2|4.0|I may be biased b/c it was the one I saw as a child, but I much prefer the Theatrical \\"Tangerine Dream\\" Version over the director's cut. I was thrilled to find Legend on DVD, since my taped from TV VHS had long since died, only to be horrified by the immediate and obvious changes in the version I had found (director cut). I preferred the Star Trek like intro of the US version as I think it set the darker tone for the movie. The Goldsmith score is too whimsical and not at all reflective of the movies dark fairy tale - the Tangerine Dream version, though \\"pop-y, was much better suited for the film. It may just be me, but I also felt that the extended director's cut version had a much less likable Lili - The more extended the scenes w/ her are the more she seems like a selfish spoiled brat rather than the sweet innocent princess that the theatre version had. As, I said before I may be biased by nostalgia, but the US Theatre Version w/ Tangerine Dream is my favorite by far. I can't even stand to watch the other... So glad I have finally found the LEGEND I had been searching for!    Also for those reviewers who stated that they are happy Scott changed the movie score to the Goldsmith score and added the extras scenes - it was the opposite! The director's cut WAS the original version and he changed it to what was later the US version, so obviously he did not agree that that score/version was better....

193413712X|5.0|I read this book because of the fairy-tale story of how it was brought to the attention of the publishing industry the old fashioned way, through word of mouth and one person showing the book to another person after having read it, resulting in publication and an award.  I then enjoyed the book a great deal, even if it is perhaps not flawless.  What I liked about the book was that I was able to care about and become attuned to characters who were very particular, and very different from me - that is a real accomplishment.  In the end, three generations of men are represented, each with lives that are specific in their details, and yet I could enter into their stories.  The book also manages to create a balance of at least two or three levels, layered among and within each other, without showing the seams of how they are put together and then are simultaneously present.  The levels I mean are...a very grounded reality of life-as-it's-lived on one hand, alongside poetic and minute descriptions of natural places and occurrences, alongside perhaps a nearly philosophical approach to the life issues presented.  Similarly, the lives of three men are presented alongside each other.  In both of these cases, the image that comes to my mind - of what the writer has done - is of multiple pieces of clay that are pieced together, perhaps shards of something that has been broken, and some moisture is applied to the line where they are matched and is rubbed into the clay so that the original disconnection is no longer visible.  It is quite impressive, how the author achieves these multiple levels in one novel.  Surprisingly, then, he also maintains a relatively consistent tone throughout, even as he moves over these different elements of the territory.  The final result is a book that is beautiful to listen to, for its own sake, and that also draws you in, to the point where you want to know precisely what he has to tell you - not like a mystery and \\"who done it\\" but like the natural evolution of a story well told.  The one minor quibble is that occasionally, and I am not a professional writer myself, there were moments where the writing sounded just a bit like the results of a writing exercise, and even one or two moments where it seemed the author may have inserted a paragraph that was written independently of the novel, as an exercise.  While much of the novel may well have come out of such a process, at those moments, the seam between two clay pieces perhaps needed a bit more work to be covered over, to make it whole.  One more note on the book, which is positive.  At one point, I had reason to read it aloud to someone else.  I was struck then, not realizing when I was reading it to myself, at how beautiful the language and rhythm are in this first novel.  So, there is something about the novel that feels as if it is still a bit early in the author's development.  At the same time, it is truly a beautiful story, with great heart and also restraint, beautifully told.  Well worth reading.
B003SJ4VJ6|5.0|Watch Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown and Ghost Writer and there is one undeniable fact - few directors can tell a story on film like Polanski without the need for excessive violence, special effects and trickery. What a master of pacing! There is not really a moment in this film where the sense of anticipation is missing - I applaud Robert Harris and Polanski for not going for LCD here.    The acting is spot on. It's a rare day I don't see who is who in a film, but this one kept me guessing.  Add a fun, intriguing mystery and unbelievable settings, and you've got a class film. And I agree with another reviewer who said this echoed Hitchcock at his best - I had that sense very early on. When you wonder what difference a director really makes, watch those two masters and you'll see how so many others fall short.    What a blast.

044656740X|1.0|\\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a pointless personal finance book--it offers no practical advice on achieving great wealth. What author Robert Kiyosaki does offer is a series of rants on the status of the education system and his former investments as well as several get quick easy schemes that seem borderline illegal, shady at best. To those looking to improve their finances, I would not recommend this book--try finding one with more practical, real, and legal advice.

If you're reading the book for the hype or a great, seamless story that makes you feel like you're right there with her, then I believe you will be disappointed. If you are driven to read this by something you just can't explain then I think you'll get what you need from it. I think she is an ok writer. Not great. She's tells an ok story but it could have been a great story. For me, this was not one of those books that you just can't put down, that draws you in so deeply you forget to eat. I had to force myself to press through it but I was able to because there are pieces of it that kept me coming back for more. There are interesting experiences, information, and revelations sprinkled throughout the book - they may or may not be worth it for you.
B000063DI8|3.0|After 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son Steve Harris decided it was time for the band to go back to the sound of the early days and because of this guitarist Adrian Smith left the band unhappy with this direction. Guitarist Janick Gers makes his debut with Iron Maiden replacing Smith.The result No Prayer for The Dying was rawer and not as epic as some of their past albums, because of the sound it can be considered as a step backward for the band. As a result No Prayer for The Dying received mixed reactions from fans. Some fans of the band think they should have continued or expended on the more epic and progressive sound of albums like Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son instead of attempting to go back to the band's earlier sound. Going back to the sound of the first few albums was not totally a bad idea, after all I love those albums, but perhaps it was not the right time or maybe that idea was not executed as well as it could have been. Sadly for me, NPFTD has the distinction of being one of Maiden's worst albums. Don't get me wrong I don't hate the album; it's just that I don't find it as strong as other releases by this band even if there are still some enjoyable moments here and there.<br /><br />The album opens with Tailgunner which is basically a different perspective on Aces High, solid intro to NPFTD. Holy Smoke follows and it's a great song as well. The title song is a slower and more melodic one, I really like this one. I could live without ever hearing Public Enema Number One and Fates Warning again, not that they're unlistenable but The Assassin is definitely a low point for me. The album gets considerably better with Hooks In You and Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter, both catchy tunes and memorable ones. The last song Mother Russia is a failed attempt at finishing the album with an epic song like they did on Somewhere In Time with Alexander The Great, it falls short and doesn't achieve anything it sets out to be.<br /><br />Maiden had quite a few struggles in the 1990's, Adrian Smith was replaced by Janick Gers, NPFTD and Fear of the Dark received mixed reactions, Bruce left the band to do a solo career and their albums with replacement singer Blaze Bailey were generally not well received. No Prayer For The Dying is certainly not an album that I often play, there are some very good songs but overall I find it to be one of the weaker Maiden albums. It sounds a little uninspired and dull. Plus there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between Dave Murray and Janick Gers, at least not like Adrian and Dave had. It's surely not a high point of Maiden's career and back catalog, it's still enjoyable to some degree but don't expect a classic here. 3 stars.w struggles in the 1990's, Adrian Smith was replaced by Janick Gers, NPFTD and Fear of the Dark received mixed reactions, Bruce left the band to do a solo career and their albums with replacement singer Blaze Bailey were generally not well received.

B002ZG999U|4.0|With the age of giant, muscle bound heroes generally past us, it's refreshing to see a movie that hearkens back to the 80's and early 90's, when the giants of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, and others took on the bad guys with cheesy one liners.  And while \\"The Expendables\\" won't resurrect the muscle hero genre, it is a nice, charming visit that's a lot of fun to go along with.    The plot of \\"The Expendables\\" is very simple.  Sylvester Stallone is the head of a group of mercenaries who will do any job for any price.  When a job comes in to take out some shadowy figures in charge of an enslaved banana republic, his team go in to do their job while Stallone has a more personal stake in what's going on.    It's a very simple plot, but in a movie like this, that's all it needs, as well as simple characters.  You won't get any in-depth studies of the human psyche, as the characters are labeled by a defining trait.  Stallone is the leader, another guy is hotheaded and loves knives, another guy loves his automatic shotgun, another is the short Asian guy who gets picked on, and another guy has ears that look like Cauliflowers.  But it works, as the characters are larger then life, and don't need any real character development at all.  Such a thing is also secondary to the numerous fights, explosions, gunfire, and one liners thrown our way every few minutes, or, in the case of the finale, every few seconds.     If you're a fan of giant, hot-blooded action movies, then \\"The Expendables\\" is definitely worth a look.  It's perfectly content to be big, loud, and full of giant muscles.  But it works, and it's fun.  It a fine tribute to the action films as old...and as an added bonus, we get a great scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Bruce Willis all appear together in the same scene for the very first time.  It's short, but a fun reminder that some of the most memorable action heroes in film history are truly larger then life, and only need to rely on their charisma to carry a film, and that's celebrated all the way through \\"The Expendables.\\"

B000FGGE68|2.0|My favorite movie, hands down, is [[ASIN:B00005JLWN Equilibrium]].  The spiritual successor to The Matrix, Equilibrium had the perfect mix of cinematography, pathos, and action that has rarely been equaled. And the first thing I thought when watching Ultraviolet was...\\"Wow, this is a terrible imitation of Equilibrium.\\"<br /><br />Equilibrium used its special effects sparingly, cutting away when appropriate, zooming in when necessary, and always remaining focused on relationships despite the nihilistic setting. To my surprise, Kurt Wimmer, director of Equilibrium, also directed Ultraviolet.  Something clearly went horribly awry.<br /><br />The parallels between the two films are striking.  The fabled Gun Kata - a martial art using pistols - is clearly in evidence in Ultraviolet. The same dystopian future plagues humanity, only instead of emotion the authorities suppress hemophages (a cute term for vampires). And just like in Equilibrium, the main character's relationship with children is at the crux of her redemption. And yet Equilibrium is superior to this film in every way.<br /><br />Buried somewhere in Ultraviolet is a parable about fear, misplaced trust, and abuse of authority - all the same themes explored in Equilibrium. The special effects are generally above par, the combat scenes impeccable, and Mila Jovovich (as Violet) is as deadly sleek as ever. But when the CGI clearly doesn't hold up, the camera never looks away.  When combat scenes should be beautiful they become blurry jump-cuts of confusion.  When Violet gets mad, instead of a cold killing machine she comes off as a mumbling thug. Aeon Flux she ain't.<br /><br />Ultraviolet has high ambitions for its comic book \\"Japanimation\\" aesthetic, but it fails by simply being all violence all the time. Equilibrium had a similar premise but it pulsed with love, sorrow, and rage.  Conversely, Ultraviolet has the emotion dial set to angry and keeps it there. It's not that the movie is terrible - it simply has no soul.
1400032717|1.0|I had to force myself to finish this book.  I'm not at all certain what Haddon was trying to do with this story or this main character.  I felt as though the story was told by an annoying, whiny, 10-year-old.  I've not had experience with autistic children, but this cannot be the best example.  Think Kevin from Parenthood crying over his lost retainer and this about sums up the main character, Christopher-- with one exception:  unlike Kevin, Christopher is a math genius.  The best parts of the book were the various references to math and logic problems (e.g., reference to Marilyn Vos Savant's column in Parade magazine explaining The Monty Hall Problem), and I'd rather get those from a math and logic game book.  In the end, I did not care about Christopher, the dead dog, Toby (Christopher's pet rat), his mother, his father, or any of the other empty characters.  Blah!
B003JTHESA|5.0|I had to figure that all the \\"old time\\" Maiden fans would find fault with this recording.  Many music fans that find bands at one point in their chronology assume/expect that all follow on music will be exactly the same.  Fortunately, this is nearly never the case, with exception of the silly generic pop acts that are more product marketing than musicians.  Most real musicians are always growing, changing and trying new things, sounds and ideas.   It doesn't always work out for the best, but many times, the evolution of long time professional musicians are really great.   I am a long time Iron Maiden fan, and I do have nearly all their music from the beginning.    Personally, I always seem to like to take the journey with many great bands, just to see where they go musically.  As I get older, I find that many of older bands can still rock out, yet their writing and performing gets more mature, more refined, and their musicianship becomes better and more listenable.   Some flame out and lose their energy, but that's not the case with Iron Maiden.    The Final Frontier is one of those examples for me at least.   I love the sound, the pace, and I can listen to the entire album in one sitting.   To my ears, there is no filler, every song was thought about, polished and presented in a very Maiden like way.  The sound is heavy without being tiring and burdensome.   I never feel like Iron Maiden released this album because the needed money or needed to prove that they are still relevant (like so many bands do these days).        This is a musical collection from the soul, heart and mind.  It is very progressive in nature, very modern and thoughtful.  The guitars are awesome and crunchy, no noise, no dopey shredding, just musical and melodic.   I look forward to the next step in Iron Maidens journey...   should be great
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This was probably the most disturbing film I have ever seen. I hate the torture horror/porn genre and a friend of mine recommended this to me. First of all if you thought this film was dull, then I really shudder to think of what you find exciting.  Second of all, I've read some reviewers claim there was no suspense in this film, which really could not be farther from the truth.  The first half of the film is loaded with surprise and tension, and the second half took the film in such a direction that I don't think the most seasoned of film watchers could have seen coming. If you claim you did, I can't be 100% sure, but you're probably a liar.<br /><br />Third, this was not gratutious torture like some would claim it to be.  You want to watch gratutious torture, go see rest stop, or Turistas or other assorted films.  This was an intelligent film.  I can't really explain more without ruining the ending for you who haven't seen it.  If you're looking for a torture porn flick to satiisfy yourself with, move on.  Don't watch this.  If you're looking for a movie that has a meaning, that requires you to think, that will horrify you, and that WILL make you open your eyes to the true criminals of this world.  Don't look any further.  You've found it.<br /><br />You won't want to watch this film more than once.  Seriously.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Jaden Smith displayed passion.  It was a delight to see the various emotions on his face.  I have seen all the Karate kid movies and this one is the best.  Jackie Chan was exceptionally sensitive in the part of an adult learning from his student, showing that if we open our minds even the young ones can teach us a thing or two.  I will not spoil this for others.  Just ignore the negatives and see the movie for yourself, you will be entertained.  I am getting the DVD.  Will Smith move over we have a new kid in town.
9889979942|5.0|Rarely does a book of richly colored photographic images  of a country and the people that inhabit that country on every page reveal so much of a culture that the book becomes an instant resource for fascinated travelers (real and armchair), students, teachers, and readers who care about the planet we call Earth.  CHINA: PORTRAIT OF A PEOPLE  is indeed what the title suggests: within the covers of this book are more faces sampling the 1.3 billion people who inhabit the 33 provinces and the 56 cultures of the vast country of China, faces that range from the new born to the elderly, the healthy to the suffering, the traditional culture bound with the new Westernized modern look, all placed within the context of the land and the life differences in one fascinatingly diverse country.<br /><br />Tom Carter almost unintentionally created this brilliant book. His goal was to spend two years traveling across China, lingering long enough in each of the varied provinces to learn the customs, the people's way of life, the history that varies so greatly among the provinces (both ancient and recent - meaning within the last century), and capture the land and the people who dwell there with his camera.  A young politician by training, Carter had already made a similar journey through Mexico, Central America and Cuba: this idea of earnest sociological, journalistic and humanitarian investigations was in place.  In 2004 he traveled to the People's Republic of China as an English language teacher in Central China and in two year's time he resolved to learn more about the people who inhabit this divers and historically rich land: in 2006 he began his trek by every possible means of transportation traveling through every province, staying is many cities, soaking up the realities of life there that too often are obscured from tourists, committed to learning all he could, incorporating the splendors of the vistas from the Gobi Desert to the highest mountains of Tibet to the lush mountains and rivers and the seas and oceans that brush China's borders - and capturing it all on film!<br /><br />Few of us realize how disparate are the various provinces of this great country. Carter shows us these variations of religions (Buddhism, Muslim, and variations within these, and more), farming, apparel, ritual, celebrations, animals, connections to the earth, the influence of the mass changes of Westernization on the beauty of the historically significant architecture, the lay of the land in the way it supports (and in certain cases dooms) its people, the forms of sport and entertainment, compassion and revolt, and the response of the people to the presence of an 'outsider'.  Carter's photographic images were taken with Olympus Camedia C400 camera: more color saturation could not be possible than in the images we see here.<br /><br />Another major aspect of this book is the presence on most pages of a few words by the author that so simply define the meaning behind each of the provinces and the people he has captured on film.  Each section on each of the 33 provinces begins with a succinct description about the historical significance and the unique aspects of that province.  At times there are bits of poetic moments shared, and at time the words of someone he met are shared.  In all, then, this as complex a diary of a country as any book presented about he vast country that is China, an ancient and yet also very modern neighbor.  Reading and absorbing this book will provide the reader with a true sense of the cultural riches of China: more important, the reader will feel an affinity for these people with whom we share life on the planet. Highly recommended to all readers.  Grady Harp, August 10ivers and the seas and oceans that brush China's borders - and capturing it all on film!

B003498SDA|5.0|No collection would be complete without this movie; it has everything.  Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett-Smith are wonderful and believeable.  You'll be on the edge of your seat as soon as Tom Cruise gets into Jamie Foxx' cab.  Collectible!

B002LITRTO|4.0|I was extremely surprised to find how much I enjoyed this book. I thought it would be about whiny, spoiled teenagers suffering through high school drama, but I was definitely wrong. Sure, it is about spoiled teenagers in high school, but the story was strangely addicting! The girls are crazy! I cannot believe some of the things they did at such a young age. The story is pretty much centered around the secrets these girls have from before their friend, Alison, vanished in 7th grade. For 7th graders, they have a lot more secrets than I have ever had. It was interesting to see that those secrets still control their lives three years later.    I loved how each chapter was in either Spencer's, Aria's, Hanna's or Emily's point of view. Spencer and Aria were by far my favorite characters. I found their lives more interesting and exciting than Hanna's or Emily's. I did not really like Hanna at times, and Emily was just forgettable to me. Even now, it was hard to remember her name.    The creepy messages that the girls receive from a person known only as 'A' reminded of the show Gossip Girl. Every time I read one of them, I could not help imagining them being said in the same voice as Gossip Girl.    Overall, Pretty Little Liars was fast-paced. It was extremely hard to put it down (I was only reading five chapters a day for the Read Along), and when I did put it down, I was thinking about it for the rest of the day. I wanted to know what happens next, and if I was not reading it as part of a Read Along, I would have finished it in a day. I would recommed this book to mature teenagers and up since there are many mature themes in this book such as drugs, alcohol, student-teacher affair, shoplifting, eating disorders, etc. In my opinion, it is more of a guilty-pleasure type of book, but I sure did enjoy it! I am definitely looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00008OE4W|5.0|This show was never advertised much and I  just happened to see it at a rental store. The cast is tremendous and  the reverals to political action are great.
0446569895|5.0|I am not a reader not someone that has to have a book to read all the time in fact maybe once in a couple of years would I find something to read. However this book   \\"I AM OZZY\\" I could not put down,this book will have you lauaghing crying it is just crazy. I highly recomend this book to any one not just a Black Sabbath fan or an Ozzy fan any one because it is just great reading.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|It was wonderful.  Really showed the circumstances of that time and really showed the MAN as being quite the family man as well as a great statesman.  The acting was superb also.  I wish they did more of these miniseries with all our past presidents.  We totally enjoyed.
0545123283|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved Shiver, the first book in The Wolves of Mercy Falls series. I loved everything about it from beginning to end. In fact, it is one of my favorite books. I would have been fine if Shiver was a stand-alone book because the ending was perfect, in my opinion (You can read my review of Shiver here). That being said, I was a little weary when I first heard that there would be a sequel to Shiver, but I was still excited to see where Maggie Stiefvater was going to take the story.<br /><br />Overall, Linger was a great story. I did not think it was as good as Shiver, but it was still pretty great, so I am glad I read it. I still love the way Maggie writes. It is beautiful to say the least. In addition to Sam and Grace, I definitely enjoyed Isabel and Cole as new narrators especially Isabel. I love the way she thinks and operates. The way that she speaks is just great. I love her sarcasm. Cole is pretty great too in a suffering soul type of way.<br /><br />Sam and Grace were amazing as usual. I love the way they are together. They definitely face new hardships in this book. Things I would have never expected, and I do not know how they are going to overcome these new obstacles. After everything they went through, I could not help but feel sorry for them.<br /><br />I am looking forward to finding out what happens in the next book, Forever. I wonder how Maggie is going to tie up everything. July 2011 seems like a long wait...
0671015206|4.0|Although written in the late nineties, I recently reread this little gem and found many of its insights still relevant.  Among them, that affluent people are more likely to drive your everyday sedan than an exotic sports car. That accumulating wealth is more likely the result of frugality, planning, and discipline than the result of a high income stream or prestigious occupation.  That the wealthy are just as protective and foolish over their children as the rest of us.  And, that being the child of wealthy parents is more likely to harm your ability to accumulate wealth than is being the child of immigrants.       Of the insights above, the importance of frugality and planning is the most persuasive and enduring to this reader's mind.  Less persuasive are the many tables of figures so clumsily put together and coupled with pedestrian predictions like \\"the SUV is becoming increasingly favored by wealthy Americans.\\"  No doubt over a decade of hindsight has made some of these predictions seem trite.  The larger narrative, though, is still fresh, compelling, and worthy of application.  Doing so may not make you a millionaire, but it will place you on a more solid financial footing.
B003S897U0|5.0|Croweology is a 20 song, double disc acoustic set from The Black Crowes.  It is what I would call a \\"jam band\\" recording as it was recorded live in studio.  The collection features a number of extended cuts with long guitar, organ, piano, and/or harmonica solos.  I thought that Chris Robinson's vocals were incredible as the selection of songs showcase the warm, melodic side with very little in the way of his trademark screams - the notable exception is \\"Bad Luck And Blues Eyes\\".<br /><br />I checked out on The Black Crowes between The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion and Warpaint.  As a result I was only familiar less than half of the songs on this collection.  However, I really enjoyed the gospel backup singers on a number of the songs that hearkened back to The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion.  I thought this added an interesting touch to the version of \\"Jealous Again\\" found here.  Standout songs for me that I hadn't heard before were \\"Share The Ride\\" which is very folky sounding compared to samples of \\"Let Me Share The Ride\\" from Three Snakes & One Charm, \\"Good Friday\\" with its mournful harmonica intro, and \\"Ballad In Urgency\\" with its earnest vocal delivery, strong acoustic guitars, and extended guitar/piano jam solo.<br /><br /> Overall, I can't find much to fault with Croweology.  I would highly recommend it to Black Crowes fans and fans of jam bands like The Allman Brothers.  There's not a lot like this among contemporary music, and it really stands out as top shelf as a result.<br /><br />Download this:  Share The Ride
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had read this book years ago and thought it a good book.  This year I found the DVD on the list of things Amazon suggested I buy.  I loved PRIDE & PREJUDICE, but NORTH & SOUTH is hands down the very best production I have ever seen.  I have recommended it to all my friends.    This was so much richer than the book.  It filled in the story line so very much, and I think it is better than the book by far.  The great choices of Mr. Thorton and Miss Hale were inspired.  The cinematograpy was excellent as was everything about this film.  Many scenes were so memorable they are forever etched in my mind.  One closeup of Mr. Thorton with  his failed mill in the background was spectacular as was the one when Miss Hale opens the factory door for the first time, and there were many many more.  The music was haunting and beautiful and forewarned you of what was to come.      If anyone is thinking of doing another remake of JANE EYRE, I suggest Richard Armitage for the part of Mr. Rochester--no one can brood like he can.  Buy this DVD you won't regret it.
B003OCWF6I|4.0|This film packs a punch to the head that I was very surprised by. I think the film did not get its due since it was released close to Kick Ass which I also enjoyed. The cast is great, the action is great, and the style is very unique. Blu ray transfer is right on.

B000EYK4GW|5.0|I am completely thrilled with the promptness and quality of the Disney Dumbo (Big Top Edition) DVD I recently purchased.  I am always somewhat leary of online purchase, but was pleasantly surprised when the DVD was received.  It not only was in excellent shape but also arrived a week before anticipated.  I have been able to enjoy this with my two year old granddaughter on numerous occassions[[ASIN:B000EYK4GW Dumbo (Big Top Edition)]]
B003JTHESA|5.0|When I'd heard that Iron Maiden were in the studio working on a new album, I had my doubts. First and foremost, the production from the most recent Dickinson-fronted albums has always kept me from enjoying them as thoroughly as I might if they were mixed and mastered more effectively. So when the release date finally came around, I checked \\"The Final Frontier\\" out, not expecting for it to even be listenable.    Maybe I'm just not enough of a TRVE KVLT Iron Maiden fan, but I honestly believe that this is the best album they've done since \\"Powerslave\\". On the production front, they've finally managed to find a good balance between their old-school metal sound and the production techniques present in modern music, and the recordings sound much better because of that.    From a musical standpoint, every single track is unique in its own way, and the entire album just plain rocks. The songwriting is stunning on this release, and seems to find Maiden toying with some of the sounds, techniques, and themes reminiscent of some of their 80s material. Bruce's voice may not be exactly what it used to be, but he's definitely still got an incredible vocal talent, and he knows his limits; he sounds perfect and just as good as ever on this album. In fact, the instrumentation from the entire band is extremely tight and solid here, with very few exceptions.     Perhaps most importantly here, every song on the album has its own stand out qualities and each one is instantly recognizable. I can personally see every piece of music here translating extremely well to a live performance environment.    Some people seem to be under the illusion that this is \\"progressive\\" in some way; those people apparently don't listen to a lot of prog, as this is NOT progressive metal.    And finally, though there are hoards of naysayers, I sincerely believe that this would be universally hailed as a Maiden classic of an album if it were recorded in the 80s. Either way, I know that years down the road whenI personally look back on their discography, this album will be the shining gem of the '00s era of Iron Maiden.
B002ZG997C|2.0|A friend of mine strongly recommended this film to me. I saw it wondering what's going on. I was impressed with the cinematrography but it grew old and then I looked for the story which this film really doesn't have. I understand a lot of people have credited this film and some have even discussed their disagreement with the central character and wondered what religion he belongs to. I, sadly, am never going to reach that stage because this film doesn't deserve discussion. In some way, it's hopeless, lacks any half intelligent dialog, the only thing effective is the soundtrack, the action sequences are bizzare and I feel today's audience is too intelligent and a tad bit too impatient to sit through something like this. Atleast this is my opinion. The film had absolutely no premise, there is just one central character of Washington who acts like he's a messiah of some sort, at no point in this film is any wit, any humor, any heartfelt emotion displayed. I'm a big Washington fan but I was disappointed he made something like this.<br /><br />Because people have liked this, I would strongly recommend you watching it prior to buying.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I don't know what the director had in mind for this movie, but for me this film is a sort of inspired comedy.  Carl Sagan once observed that modern science fiction movies are actually adventure movies that lack any tangible reference to science.  This is certainly the case here--but made all the more obvious by the fact that this world is made to seem to rely on twentieth century technology.  The effect of a flying aircraft carrier appearing out of nowhere to refuel the hero's single engine P-40 like fighter (a model of military industrial complex inefficiency and over budget thinking) was shocking to behold!  The explicit impossibility of this world seemed to exalt in technical absurdities rather than attempt to paper them over.  For my son and I (both of us engineers)--the surprising appearance of each incredible scene evoked uproarious laughter!<br /><br />I should also say that I loved the Art Deco look of everything from malevolent robots and rocket ships to newsrooms and skyscrapers.  It reminds me of the Forbidden Planet era conception of streamlined spacecraft that I enjoyed as a small child at the dawn of the space age.  How disappointing clunky are real space vehicles when compared to the clean lines of one of the shapely rocket arc seen in the final scenes of this movie--a veritable finned Cadillac of the heavens!

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I am still trying to understand why people complain about this DVD release.  Everybody nitpicks about everything.  I put in the disc that has the Original Theatrical Version and started watching it.  I wasn't sure if i was watching the the right version because the quality is fine.  I watched it and sure enough Han Shot First and i knew i was watching the right version.  Sure i wasn't watching it on a wide screen TV but should that be the reason that we judge the whole set.  I like it because i have both versions of the movie.  The one with all the edits and the original version.  The movie itself is as good as it ever was.  If you already have Star Wars (The original trilogy) on DVD that is not this version then i don't recommend this.  But if you don't have the original trilogy then this is the perfect version.  (This review also applies to The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi).
B002LIZWTI|5.0|The only negative thing about \\"Exquisite Corpse\\" is that it is simply an EP and far too short.  This band creates music that is hauntingly beautiful.  Listening to samples of the songs only allows a brief snapshot; please know that the songs transition in tempo and volume, each with its own personality.  Warpaint definitely loves their reverb as well as using vocal effects, which helps to create that soft feeling of transcending space and time when you listen to their music.  Warpaint has an amazing grasp of harmony and melody; they know how to keep the music interesting.  Each song is so spellbinding in that shoegazer, trance inducing cloud of brilliance, allowing you to float between the notes and totally lose yourself in the music.  Expand your mind and sonic sensibilities and buy this EP!

0142405809|3.0|We purchased this book because my two year old son enjoyed Room on the Broom.  Unfortunately I think the book is for an older child so it's spent most of the time on my son's bookshelf, untouched.  We tried to read through it once but 3/4 through the story, my son was asking for another book instead!   He has refused further offers to read the story again.  The writing is much more complex, the sentences are long and the story in itself is a bit too winding for my 2.5 year old boy.    We hope to begin enjoying it in a year or so.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|First of all, I was thinking this would be good until the trailer revealed it all.  Man, I was so wrong about it and it ruined my weekend the week this pile of garbage came out as my martial arts school was paid so much to do promotions by performing in theaters to lure in customers.  This will leave dissapointment to fans of the classic, the only people that would like this are kids of the current generation.      I wasn't born in the 80's, since I'm from the 90's generation.  I grew up watching the classic and it's been a part of my childhood since then, my papa used to rent the movie so much for me.  Unfortunately, that was it after the trilogy and it went downhill w/\\"The Next Karate Kid\\" and the Jaden Smith one is worse than the previous.        Here's why this movie isn't good      The title left confusion, leaving many people wondering as to why it's called that when they could've just called it \\"The Kungfu Kid\\".  What's wrong with calling it that?  The movie is known by a different title in Asia of what I just mentioned.      Casting of characters was just blah!  Jaden Smith's acting wasn't good and he seems to try too hard to be likable.  Personally, I didn't like how Hollywood decided to pick this kid that looks nothing more than some hoodlum of a thug wannabe, his image shows it in the movie.  He talks too much with cheesy lines after another, making him rather annoying than likable.  His character didn't even bother to learn Chinese, which makes it pointless to live in a country that you don't know speak the language for, let alone that he can't even use chopsticks.  His mom gets annoying with the whole \\"pick up your jacket!\\" and wearing all these flashy looking clothes to try to fit in with the Chinese.  Overall, Ralph Macchio beats his act.      Jackie Chan's acting wasn't good, no offense to you JC fans out there.  I appreciate his previous flicks to where he's not some grumpy man (like Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino) who hates his life after he got his wife and kid killed in a car crash for simply arguing w/his wife which explains the whole wreackage of the car he has which made no sense.  His character's attitude seemed like he wanted to get off the set as soon as possible.  That's not the Jackie Chan we all know and love.  Also, even I heard some Theater staff saying that JC was even upset with the title.  Noriyuki Morita's acting as Mr.Miyagi was a whole lot better and the opposite of JC's grumpy Mr.Han.        Next off is those Chinese kids that bully Jaden's character.  They are such douchebags, which makes Johnny Laurence and his Cobra Kai gang more likable and less annoying.  The leader of the Chinese kid is the worst of all, in the movie they did far much worse than what the Cobra Kai gang did to Daniel.  What was really immature of them (Chinese kids) was when they flopped Jaden's lunch tray, ruining his clothes and when they grabbed his backpack, they tossed it around and kicked it for a bit, such jerks!  Johnny Laurence was a douche on his part, but he made up for it with some of his lines that was funny.  Also, the Cobra Kai followed their teacher's order completely by not messing with Daniel until the Tournament, not unlike Cheng and his gang of immature losers.      Dre Parker is already hitting on some girl and he only 12 years old and yet to hit puberty.  The movie shouldn't involve some elementary age kids that know little or nothing about acting, it could've been saved from suckage if they didn't choose first timers that made their bad acting obvious with all these lines they throw in.  It would've been better if they involved teenagers, not some wannabe looking hoodlum and a group of wannabe bad boys in an elementary school setting.            Enough said about this, for it will damage the name of the classic for years to follow.  I can just imagine how I'd be talking about the one and only and when people jump into the conversations, they'd be asking \\"Which one?  The Ralph Macchio one orJaden Smith?\\"  There's only one Karate Kid out there and that's Daniel Larusso.  Stick with the classic if you want to see a good movie, not those crappy remakes.

B00076RT24|1.0|I should make it clear that though I am fan of the original three Star Wars movies, I do not hate the prequel movies out of some kind of fanatical fanboy reaction. I just don't like the films because they are not good films.<br /><br />Defense of this film and the other two follow-ups has been fierce in the wake of wrath from many disappointed fans and haters of Jar Jar Binks. Prior to its release, I understand that some die-hard fans showed their loyalty to the Star Wars franchise by paying out over $500 to see the premiere of \\"Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.\\" If you paid $500 for a crappy movie, you'd defend it rather than admit you wasted a buttload of dinero.<br /><br />Phantom Menace: A Phantom Movie<br /><br />The Phantom Movie has a ghost of a plot and a phantasm of characterization. Mainly, it is just one long joyless ride of mediocrity relying more on flash than substance. As many critics and fans have pointed out over the years, the first three movies may have had many flaws but they were overall good films with interesting characters and a simple but engaging plot.<br /><br />Some people gripe about \\"Return of the Jedi\\" because one of the most controversial moments in the original trilogy has to be the introduction of the Stone Age teddy bears known as the Ewoks. However, one really has to admit that Jar Jar Binks of \\"Episode I\\" redeems the Ewoks; at least some of those teddy bears had the decency to die and you couldn't understand them when they were talking.<br /><br />The original Star Wars films had enormous success and popular acceptance because they were grounded in ancient primal myths that people from all generations and cultures could relate to. In addition, the first three films are nostalgic of 1950s and 1930s sci-fi adventures films and serials. There is a lot of just sheer, campy fun lines like, \\"I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you!\\"<br /><br />Nothing like this in \\"Episode I.\\" Dialog is appallingly poor and lifeless. The characters are uninteresting, with the exception of the rarely seen Darth Maul -- and even he comes off second best to Boba Fett of the original films. Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan character has far less screen time in \\"Star Wars\\" than Liam Neeson's practically unpronounceable Jedi character. And yet Obi-Wan's death had far more impact on audiences than the latter's because Obi-Wan was more of a recognizable, developed character an audience could feel for. I felt Neeson's character was a stranger throughout the whole movie, more cardboard than Jedi. I sometimes forget that he even died in the movie, his character being so forgettable as it was. I don't blame Neeson for this. I blame poor storytelling and characterization.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm getting too old for special-effects eye candy, but I found the CGI in the film overbearing and fake. Give me the old clunky-looking models and men-in-rubber-suit aliens. It seems that when Lucas and company had less money and technology they were forced to be more creative. Now blessed (or cursed) with an abundance of both, the end result is Jar Jar Binks, one of the most hated sidekicks to darken the silver screen. As for the battle robots, they are wimpy-looking talking broomsticks with guns.<br /><br />The humor of \\"Episode I\\" is degrading and pandering to kids with primarily all of it delivered by Jar Jar through poor slapstick routines Buster Keaton would have been nauseated by. The humor of the first three films works mainly because there is chemistry among the characters.<br /><br />The story of \\"Episode I\\" doesn't hold interest well either. We have a plot about a blockade over trade regulations (at last! economics and sci-fi!) and a kid with extraordinary powers but possessing all the personality and charm of a piece of furniture.<br /><br />Then there's the very subtle sub-plot of Darth Maul that's so sub it's practically a submarine. And there's just too much repetition in certain scenes, such as the underwater voyage on Naboo, as big fish devour big fish, and the overly long, never-thought-it-would-end pod-racing scene. Perhaps NASCAR racing fans liked it.<br /><br />Overall, things happen more by blind dumb luck rather than by the Force, such as Anakin blowing up the mother ship completely by accident. And speaking of the Force, gone is the mystical, Zen-like idea that so grabbed audiences and pop culture of the past. Instead we have a scientific Star Trek interpretation of the Force as some kind of blood disease.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems I had with the film was Anakin Skywalker, often lovingly referred to by many critics as \\"Manakin Skywalker.\\" Jake Lloyd's acting abilities aside, presenting the future Darth Vader as a kid is not so crucial that a whole film should be devoted to it. The \\"Episode I\\" storyline could have been easily condensed down to about 15-20 minutes at the beginning of \\"Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\\"<br /><br />The story behind the prequels is the fall and transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. But a child is not an interesting character for the type of overall story George Lucas presented in these newer films. I would rather have had Anakin first revealed as a youth in his mid to late teens as a flawed but sympathetic hero who slowly descends in the course of the three prequels into darkness as of result of his own decisions and things outside of his control. And at absolutely no point should he shout \\"Yippee!\\" no matter how well he does something.<br /><br />A few other notes of irritated concern:<br /><br />Why do the robots in the film need to talk out loud to each other?<br /><br />Why did they have Hugh Quarshie all funked up like a 1970s chauffeur for a pimp? (referring to the Queen of Naboo's bodyguard's highly questionable fashion)<br /><br />How come Obi-Wan forgot about C3PO and R2D2 in later years? Was it Jedi senility? (I know the answer: They were just in the film to establish a flimsy continuity. Logic isn't even an option).<br /><br />And for that matter, how come Darth Vader doesn't remember Tatooine? Dark Side senility?<br /><br />Why would the rest of the Republic delegates give a toss for a backwater world like Naboo and call for a new election of their leader, Supreme Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp)?<br /><br />How is 7 or 8 too old for Jedi training? Do they have an embryo training academy? (And just forget the fact that Luke made some considerable progress in a couple of years from farm boy able to lift only small household objects to Jedi superhero challenging the Emperor and Darth Vader.)<br /><br />How come all the Naboo pilots look like close-to-retirement office workers seemingly without an ounce of combat training and wearing only safety glasses and leather baseball caps? (They looked like the clueless adults in Disney movies that the hideously adorable kids have to fill in on what is really going on.)<br /><br />Why did Obi-Wan lie about his first meeting with Anakin? Anakin was not the best pilot in the galaxy when they first met; he was a wet-behind-the-ears, 10-year-old domestic servant.<br /><br />Overall Phantom Menace was a disappointment both as a Star Wars film and just as a film period.pod-racing scene.

B0001US62I|4.0|For those of us who have long been obsessed with William Hjortsberg's unique merging of noir gumshoe and Satanic Horror (Falling Angel), this special edition of Alan Parker's film version is most welcome.  Personally I had been hoping that someone would put together a package like this for a long long time, since my original VCR and DVD editions had no extra material on them at all.  This one certainly makes up for it.<br /><br />There is plenty here to keep fans happy.  Four short documentaries on voodoo, original behind the scenes footage, several original featurettes, and full text commentary by Parker and Rourke.  Parker's narrative is most forthcoming and insightful, and I really enjoyed having him talk the viewer through every scene, giving intimate background details which really evoke a sense of time and place, as well as some interesting observations on the working relationship between himself, Rourke and De Niro.  Parker also reflects on his dealings with the author and how Hjortsberg was kind enough to allow him to take a lot of liberty with the original text.  I can vouch for this as the film is vastly different to the novel, without losing the basic tenets of the story.<br /><br />It's a pity Rourke himself is a lot less forthcoming in his analysis of the film and his role in it.  In fact he seems rather reluctant to speak at all, and one wonders why he even bothered.  This is a shame, as Rourke is an incredible actor and a unique enigmatic figure.  To me he will always be Harry Angel/Johnny Favourite, and I was always struck at how his real life experience to some extent mirrors that of the title character here.<br /><br />Overall, the combination of period background material from 1987 in conjunction with the more recent (circa 2006-07) commentary makes for a really good package of what in my view is one of the best horror films of all time.

B0039TD8LW|5.0|Great collectiable. I own ALL AC/DC CD's & DVD's. Not much to gain in the music area because their is no new music, but the DVD is awesome!
B003JTHESA|1.0|Where to begin?   This album is an utter failure on every level. Epic album, epic fail.  The producer, Kevin Shirley, blows and is nothing but Steve Harris's \\"yes man.\\"  Bruce sounds terrible, his vocals are strained and difficult to listen to.  The songs have no structure.  The intros are 3 minutes long.  The songs all sound the same except for the Powerslave remake \\"El Dorado.\\"    I love Maiden, but this is garbage.  Easily the worst Maiden album ever.    All of the 8 minute plus songs have about 2 minutes of interesting music.  There are few riffs, Bruce sounds washed up.  Pitiful.    I hope that Maiden doesn't rest on this.  This would be a sad end to an illustrous career.  Think Sabbath's Forbidden in 1995.    Kevin Shirley can't get anything out of the band.  He is clearly a \\"yes man\\" because he brings nothing to the table.  What a joke.  Get Birch, get Tsangarides, get Roy Z, get anybody else!    Poseurs will deride me, true fans will listen to this album and realise how bad it is.  There is nothing remarkable about this album.  BNW had several good songs.  DOD had Paschendale and Rainmaker, AMOLAD was excellent!  I am not just against new Maiden, I am against bad Maiden.  Speaking of \\"new Maiden\\", there are no fast paced Gers songs.  No Gers at all except for one rather bland track.  There is nothing on this album worth hearing, even Adrian Smith sounds lazy.  Buyer beware!    Listen to Blaze's last couple albums if you want real Maiden music.  Maiden could care less about what I have to say, so I don't really care what others have to say.  I am just sounding a warning to people who don't want to waste $15 on a fancy dog's frisbee.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|I will be honest, ECLIPSE was my least favorite book of the whole lot. However, I did think that this particular movie was the best yet. It has plenty of romance and lots of action too, I do believe that most guys will actually like it as well.
B001FB5634|5.0|Given my review of the novel, I feel compelled to offer some words on the film, which I've only now just gotten around to seeing.<br /><br />Of course the book is better; I never had the slightest expectation any film would be able to fully capture the fear, despair and wrenching love that [[ASIN:0307476316 The Road]] delivers.  That being said, this is a very good film telling of this story.  The design and production are outstanding, as is the acting.<br /><br />Unlike [[ASIN:B00118T63C the Coen Brothers' almost verbatim take]] on [[ASIN:0307387135 No Country for Old Men]], this film does stray somewhat from the magnificent original.  There are a few aspects of the story that are rearranged temporally, but the original book \\"feel\\" survives.  The wife/mother gets a lot more play, and the ending is considerably less ambiguous than what the book offered.  Other than that, this is the bleak, grim, straightforward story of the road.<br /><br />I was very relieved to see the awful, quick-cut video disaster footage from the trailer was nowhere to be seen in the film.  There was no F/X-laden montage setup or other predictable, dumbed-down glop pandering to viewers' meaningless need to see/know the nature of the apocalypse.  It doesn't matter one bit how we got to where we are; man and boy are stuck in it, and the father decides they have no choice but to push on.<br /><br />The F/X was consistently good, necessary for the narrative and not over-the-top.  Unlike the novel, where the massive cloud cover blotted out the moon and stars at night, making them \\"casket black,\\" the film necessarily offers some ambient lighting, just so we can see what was going on.  I was also relieved to see no green whatsoever in the wasteland scenes; the dusty or alternately gray, sodden, ashen bleakness of the daytime world was perfectly presented, consistently.  As the film progressed there were slight changes in lighting of characters and scenes, slight breaks in the clouds, etc., another tiny little sliver of hope edging toward the end titles.<br /><br />The incredible, clammy, pervasive fear of the book came through, but not nearly as powerfully as in the novel.  We got the cannibalistic bad guys in a number of contexts (sadly coming through consitently as [[ASIN:B000RTB0R6 Deliverance]]-like gomers), but a number of the scenes just didn't successfully communicate the extent to which the man would undertake security measures for overnights; on two separate occasions the man and the boy sleeping in the open in abandoned vehicles.  That's easy for the viewer to take in, but is inconsistent with the nature of the threat; it does serve, though, as an important plot vehicle early on.<br /><br />The acting was fantastic.  I was struck by the closeness of scene after scene, and I couldn't help but think of the lifelong bond that actors Mortensen and Smit-McPhee must have formed during what was likely and necessarily unpleasant, highly emotional filming.  Good on that young man for his performance, and the courage it took to do it.<br /><br />As I said of the novel, this is about abiding, unconditional parental love for and absolute dedication to a child.  It's about the nature of humanity, whatever that exactly is, and the choices one makes in the face of true doom to live honorably and ethically, and whether such a notion actually has any meaning or relevance, given the circumstances.  There are many issues and questions in this film, as in the book.<br /><br />Bottom line: This film could never be the book, so there should be no expectation of that.  If you liked the book, you should enjoy this film, as it is thoroughly faithful to it, with excellent attention to the details that made the book so powerful.  It is a superb rendering, with powerful acting from man and boy.  It is a dark and harrowing story, with the slightest of hint of happy ending; this is not a film to make you feel good, and it's unlikely you will watch repeatedly.g toward the end titles.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|this is my new favorite show--great chemistry between the main characters, great dialog, totally fun!
B003C5FMEE|5.0|WOW! I was completely blown away by a recent live performance of this group! I was so impressed that I wanted to buy the disc at the concert... but, surprise!, it had sold out already by the time I got to the merchandise tent. After going to a local disc shop, I popped this baby in my cd player and was engulfed by the sweet sounds of Trombone Shorty. This album absolutely captures the raw energy that this band gives off during live performances and is every bit as exciting.    The album features Allen Touissaint on piano on \\"On Your Way Down,\\" one of Toussaint's songs. This song is a definite highlight of the album, making it a great rendition of Toussaint's original. Lenny Kravitz sings background vocals and provides a guitar solo on \\"Something Beautiful,\\" a wonderful neo-soul/R&B song cowritten with Ryan Montbleau. Marc Broussard sings additional vocals on \\"Right to Complain\\" and Charles Smith plays synthesized bass on \\"Backatown\\" and \\"Quiet as Kept.\\" The core band features Troy \\"Trombone Shorty\\" Andrews on vocals, trombone, trumpet, keyboard, drums, and percussion! Pete Murano is an awesome guitarist and provides excellent solos and backing. Mike Ballard on bass, Joey Peebles on drums, Dwayne Williams on percussion, Dan Oestreicher and Clarence Slaughter provide awesome horn backgrounds on Bari-Sax and Alto Sax/Flute respectively.    Troy Andrews wrote/co-wrote nearly every song on this album, and it goes to show that his songwriting talent is quite substantial, especially in the New Orleans funk-jazz genre. The opener \\"Hurricane Season\\" and the title track feature awesome horn licks and are extremely catchy tunes. This album is a romp through New Orleans tinged funk and R&B and makes great music for a party or gathering. I haven't been able to pull this album from daily rotation since I purchased it!     Go out and buy this, and other albums from this artist, you can't go wrong. The musicians are above-average and the song-writing is catchy and intuitive. I wouldn't be surprised if this band skyrockets to the top within the next year or two!
B003BKF696|5.0|Rich, majestic without bombast, pensive but never heavy, driving/propulsive, orchestral but still all about guitars, drums, bass, and keys... i'm a musician who also engineers, does filmscoring, and more, and i wait for albums like this and very few come along... these days the alt/indie stuff i'm listening to is this, arcade fire's the suburbs, band of horses' infinite arms, the new pornographers' together, the black keys' brothers, shearwater's golden archipelago, deerhunter's microcastle, st. vincent's actor, and a few others... and, this and shearwater's archipelago are the only ones i return to again and again and again... absolutely cannot get enough of this album... it's all here... and it's done without the high end sonic sizzle and shallow/obvious lyrics and music of so much that's out there...  the music here is rich and engaging, is never afraid of achieving interesting layers and depth without a lot of silly chord changes, and never goes for \\"clever\\"...  this album has everything i love and hope for in good, creative, poetic, alt rock... rare and special... genuinely moving...

Well, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves once again worked well together and did a great job in this film. So she's in 2006 and he's in 2004 and they keep trying to meet. Thought what they do keep impacting each others lifes and they send letters to each other through the mailbox at the lakehouse which he is living in at the moment. It's confusing but if you do what others do and just pretend to not notice it and just deem it cute, then you will enjoy it no doubt. I liked the film in general but the plot is confusing. I even wonder if Sandra and Keanu knew what was going on half the time.

0316044695|3.0|First, I'd like to say that a person should read Victory Point before reading this book. Also you might want to check out War by Sebastian Junger who also touches on this operation.    When I first read this book I was a bit younger, I totally agreed with everything that Luttrell said and did. Now that I'm a bit older I'm seeing past a lot of the rhetoric he puts in this book. I'm not saying that he deserves to be called out for his political ideology, but he should have toned it down a bit.    In his defense, the Taliban that soft compromised their OP were likely Taliban. They were operating near the Korengal Valley, in that AO just about all of the locals are sympathetic to Taliban or ACM because logging exports had been completely shut down, that was their way of life. The ACM or Taliban in the area would often pay of locals to act as patrols or observers by simply walking around on the mountains. They could've easily killed them and gotten away. It is always better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.     Also in the book Luttrell talks about 150 Taliban pouring over the mountain at him and his team. Noble yes, but not exactly true. Ahmed Shah controlled maybe 20 hardcore fighters, in fact I just checked his wiki page and it incorrectly references that he controlled 150, and the source was Lone Survivor. The AAR estimates that Luttrell and company were ambushed by 20-30 fighters. A simple google will bring you to the site, the author included pictures of the ridge where the battle took place. There simply wasn't room for 150 fighters on the ridge, had their been that many guys, Luttrell's team wouldn't have lasted more than a minute.     Again, the story is heartbreaking and made me appreciate what these guys laid on the line for us. Minus the over-exaggerations and FOX News-esque political agenda it was a good tribute to the friends he lost that day.
B003QCCS36|2.0|Growing up during the 60's in a family that listened to all sorts of styles of music, I picked up an appreciation for anything from Frank Sinatra to Jimi Hendrix to Woodie Guthrie to Merle Haggard to The Kingston Trio . Then, during the 70's in Jr. High and High school was treated to a diverse group of students that got me to listen to anything from Elton John to James Brown to Kiss and anything in between. I really like all types of music and have learned to like Classical to Metal over the years.<br /><br />I picked this CD up because I read so many positive things about the artist that I thought I couldn't go wrong. However, I have had my issues with Grammy Award nominated people in the past....not always agreeing with their nominees or winners. Well, I guess the best way is to say that this just isn't my type of music. I don't hate it, I'm just not too fond of the over-used vocal style and the monotonous guitar playing. After the 3rd track on my first listen to this disc, I was just a bit bored and thought that it might be my mood, so I tried it a couple days later and got just about as far as I did the first time. I tried again before writing this review, and I must say that I did let it play through this time, but it's nothing special to me. It's not a bad album, I just don't care for it. I have a lady friend who says she loves \\"Ray\\" so, she's now the proud owner of this disc.

Even though Creationary seems like it would be more creative, they don't give you nearly enough bricks to build the items on the cards. The boys ended up frustrated that they couldn't build what they wanted with the amount of bricks they're given.  Being one of the most expensive of the Lego games, I expected much more from it.  Minotaurus and Magikus are cheaper and much more fun in my opinion.

B0002O7XWC|5.0|First I will say the condition of the item was like new. As for the movie, I watched it in 1969 in the theater, it seems to have more meaning now that I can reflect back 40 years. Would love to see the deleted scenes
B002ZG9788|4.0|I have always been interested in mythology, especially Greek, so this movie was one I had to see. I found it to be very cool how they brought the greek myths to life. People looking for the greatest story in the world should look elsewhere, it is (slightly) based on the story of Perseus, so it is told like a story would be in the times of the ancient Greeks. It is not developed extremely well but it's a fun movie with good actors and cool special effects. RECOMMEND for people who have an interest in Greek myth.

0307269752|2.0|What I can say about this book is that it's a page turner. Unfortunately, I found myself turning pages in an attempt to get to the thrilling parts, the parts that would, to use one of the translator's cliches, knock my socks off. But those pages don't exist. The book is a slog. There's a huge amount of expository material, there are tantalizing hints about massive conspiracies that don't pan out, and there's a lot of wasted space. Characters are weakly developed and abandoned. Why is Blomkvist's daughter getting seriously into religion? Her biblical knowledge allows her to unwittingly help her father crack a hugely important clue in the case, sending him down the rabbit-hole as he solves the murder. And then...he literally forgets about her. He muses, at some later point, that he had meant to speak to his ex-wife about his daughter's troubling new obsession with religion, but it had slipped his mind. And that's the last of it. I haven't read many bestsellers with a character who was so obviously a plot device and nothing more. Even the characters for whom Larsson has some regard are poorly fleshed out. What does Blomkvist actually feel about the women in his life--Erika Berger, Lisbeth Salander herself? Besides their irresistable attraction to him, do we get a nuanced understanding of their relationship? Hardly.<br /><br />Of course, we can forgive these character deficiencies in a good thriller. Dan Brown's books are incredibly cliched in both writing style and characterization, and just like Larsson, Brown's main character is obviously a optimistic version of the author himself. Yet we forgive Brown--somewhat--since he crafts complex, tightly-paced plots with (as he breathlessly reminds us) earth-shattering implications (government access to citizen's data! Jesus's bloodline! whatever Deception Point was about!). Brown's books are crappy, but they're still a fun read. I can't honestly say the same about this book. It moves slowly, and the amazing financial conspiracy hinted at throughout the book is resolved very unsatisfactorily at the end of the book. Moreover, Larsson's allergy to moral gray areas render the book hard to take seriously: the bad guys are rapists and Nazis, while the good guy is a gentle Swede who detests corruption and violence against women, etc etc. I'm not a big fan of thrillers, but John Le Carre is a superb author and I would recommend anything he's written, particularly \\"The Mission Song,\\" a recent title. The comparison to this novel makes Larsson look like a grade-school scribbler, not a bestselling author.ed at throughout the book is resolved very unsatisfactorily at the end of the book.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I saw this in the movies twice - the initial abridged version and the director's cut. I couldn't believe the Director's Cut could be improved upon but this 5 hour version is definitely the way to go. It's totally engrossing which makes the ending even more heart breaking.
0307454541|4.0|I was noticing various books of the trilogy in people's hands wherever I went and kept seeing it mentioned in articles getting good reviews...so I decided to try it myself.<br /><br />It has its good points and bad.<br /><br />The bad is, the book doesn't just grab you in.  It is a slow start, and I mean SLOW.  The first 50 pages or so Mikael is recalling the conversation that started the libel judgment against him.  While I understand that the story is important to the book and it's ending, it was an excruciating chapter that took me days to get through.  Once that was over, the story still moved along snail paced, going back between the lives of Mikael and Lisbeth (the girl with the dragon tattoo) separately.<br /><br />I continued to struggle until page 218 of 590, when something finally happened that was different and got me page turning.  After that, the book seemed to take off and from then on I didn't struggle and in 2 days I had the rest read.<br /><br />The good....it really is a good story, once it gets going.  I figured the mystery before the book told me, but it was a good journey all the same.  The characters Mikael and Lisbeth are good, especially when they are together, which isn't until beyond the halfway point.  In that regard, I felt the description of the book was a little misleading.  But once they are working together, it becomes a really good story and the pace really picks up.<br /><br />In all, if you can get through the uneventful first 200 pages, the rest is worth the time.

B001GCUO5M|2.0|SHUTTER is a star vehicle. DiCapro and Scorsese. One on the way up but perhaps peaking, the other running on a great reputation. I know, that sounds cynical. But doesn't it make sense? If the names were absent this complicated/predictable jumbled/simplistic piece wouldn't have made a box office ripple. I collected the movies that made them famous, not the take-the-money-and-run movies just made for money or keeping bankable names in front of audiences.     A great performance, not-enough seen, five-star movie for DiCaprio is THE BEACH [[ASIN:B00003CWM3 The Beach]].   (Very curious... This unique, very-well produced movie is available at Amazon only in VHS (used) or paired with   a Tom Cruise film or used for as low as $.63!/DVD.)    Director Scorsese greats? Too many to list, go browse. From Taxi, Raging Bull,   Goodfellas, to Last temptation of Christ, Kundun ...all great films.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|Firstly I am overtly biased regarding Willie Dixon.  He is unequivically my favorite blues man ever.  His presence live as a frontman was top notch.  Look up his stuff on You Tube or better yet get the American Folk Blues Festival DVDs for proof.<br /><br />What Dixon did as a sideman is unparalleled in any genre of music ever.  The Chess Box is a good place to start looking into that.  He also did a bunch of stuff for Cobra Records during its brief but flashy run.<br /><br />Willie didn't have a great vocal range, but he did have impeccable rythm and swagger.  He also didn't miss notes.  I was a fan of his long before the Cadillac Records movie and will be until the day I die.<br /><br />I love the Rob Wasserman cut at the end.  It shows just how diverse he could sound as a player.
0618918248|4.0|Since reading this book, I have read a few others by Mr Dawkins. Two in particular, [[ASIN:0393315703 The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design]] and [[ASIN:1416594795 The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]], were excellent and I enjoyed them immensely. It is clear from these works that this author knows his subject, has a genuine passion for it and is able to communicate his ideas lucidly. All in all, I think those two books are each better than 'The God Delusion' in terms of both content and style. However, that being said, 'The God Delusion' is still a very important work.<br /><br />Several people have discussed Mr Dawkins' arguments for the improbability of a deity or deities and I won't go into any of them except to say that his arguments are not the reason this book is important. Indeed, much of what he says has been said by others, sometimes more clearly and in better written prose. The point here is that Dawkins is not objecting to the beliefs of religious persons, rather he is speaking out against the automatic assumption by theists that their religious beliefs deserve some sort of special consideration and that it is, somehow, in bad form, or poor-taste to do or say anything that suggests you do not take their beliefs seriously. Dawkins makes this point right at the beginning of the book but many readers miss that point and instead only focus on how well, or badly, he argues against the existence of god.<br /><br />Dawkins has been criticized for his tone and for being disrespectful in the way he advances his ideas. That, however, just illustrates his point and his tone, which is not actually all that inflammatory, is just a reflection of the frustration that he, and others experience in the face of the demand by theists to some sort of special treatment because they believe in something. Too often one hears it said that that such and such a person is very devout and that you 'have to respect their beliefs.' Does nobody ever stop to consider what that means? You can respect somebody's right to believe in something, you may even respect their right to act on that belief and to espouse that belief... but how on earth can you possibly respect a belief that you yourself do not share? The idea, is ridiculous.<br /><br />In all our other affairs, political, business, social etc., we have no difficulty voicing opinions and openly criticizing the beliefs of others that differ from one's own. We can say that another person's belief is wrong, even ridiculous without usually causing too much offense but religious beliefs are traditionally off limits in this regard. Dawkins, has simply voiced the opinion, as have others, that this is wrong and that theists are not entitled to have their own particular beliefs treated as something special by everybody else. Dawkin's has perhaps ruffled a few more feathers than other writer's have but these were feathers that have long needed to be ruffled.es nobody ever stop to consider what that means?

B003ODL004|3.0|An action thriller dealing with the manipulation of dreams, Inception is the latest film from Batman Begins and Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan. Leonardo di Caprio stars as Cobb, one of an elite group of corporate espionage specialists who have mastered the technology of `dream invasion', which allows him to literally enter the dream world of a subject while he is asleep. A man with a tortured past, Cobb and his cohort Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt) are hired by wealthy industrialist Saito (Ken Watanabe) to infiltrate the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), a corporate rival, and perform an `inception', a dangerous procedure where, rather than extracting information, an idea is surreptitiously placed into the subject's subconscious without them realizing. After assembling his team (Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao), Cobb begins his journey into dreamworld, where he not only has to contend with the dangers presented by the task, but also his own personal demons, in the form of his long-dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard).    One of the more unkind reviews of Inception I read - and I'm paraphrasing here - said it was \\"considered a clever film by people who don't usually watch clever films, because they want to congratulate themselves for watching something with a brain\\". While this perhaps a little flippant, it's true that Inception is not as mind-bending and confusing as it purports to be, despite its dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream setup, which is actually surprisingly easy to follow. What it has instead is a great deal of excellent action (notably a James Bond-style sequence on skis and an astonishing zero-gravity fight in a hotel hallway), slick pacing, and some great conceptual ideas, even if they are in many ways stolen from previous films, notably The Matrix, Alex Proyas's Dark City, and David Cronenberg's eXistenZ.    The conceit in Hans Zimmer's score for the film is its origin: Édith Piaf's classic 1960 song \\"Non, je ne regretterien\\", which is used as a marker throughout the film itself, and from which Zimmer also derives the majority of the score's recurring thematic elements. The score's most recognizable motif - a big, booming, foghorn-like brass bi-chord - is actually the opening bar of the song slowed down so it becomes almost unrecognizable, alluding to the idea that time inside a dream unfolds slower than it does in the `real world'. It's a clever bit of thinking, along the same lines as Zimmer using the chimes of Big Ben during his action sequences in Sherlock Holmes, and reminds the listener that, no matter what else he is, Zimmer has always written intelligent music.    Beyond this central idea, however, Hans Zimmer's score is surprisingly conventional, heavily rooted in the increasingly ubiquitous Dark Knight action style, in that it is low on themes and motifs, but heavy on rhythms and Lorne Balfe's ambient sound design elements. It follows the musical thinking Christopher Nolan applies to all his films, in that music and sound effects should more often than not be indistinguishable from each other. While this often creates a seamlessly organic listening experience in the context of the film, it often renders the subsequent soundtrack album a little dreary; unfortunately, this is the case here. Furthermore, Nolan actively prevented Zimmer from seeing edited cuts of the film before he wrote his music, instead instructing his composer to write blocks of music based on his impressions of the screenplay and the dailies, which were then edited together in post-production. Although this `tailor made library music' approach is not new top film scoring, and although it allows Nolan to edit his film and music together in a seamless way with one mirroring the other, the side-effect of this is a lack of specificity in the scoring, emphasizing overarching moods rather than specific emotional points within a scene.    The score oscillates between two or three styles, all of which inhabit asimilar harmonic world, and all of which seek to blur the lines between reality and the dream-world with generous layers of electronic pulses and synthesized chords, not too dissimilar from the music composers like Vangelis and Brad Fiedel wrote during the 1980s. Gentle ambiences for strings and glassy sampled electronics characterize the opening and closing moments of \\"Half Remembered Dream\\". The opening cue segues into a vaguely-nourish, slightly John Barry-ish piece for a soft string wash, guitars and more grinding electronics in \\"We Built Our Own World\\", which seems to represent the mysterious relationship between Cobb and Mal which forms the emotional core of the film. \\"Old Souls\\", large parts of \\"Waiting for a Train\\" and the conclusive \\"Time\\" build on these two styles of writing, incorporating subtle piano performances and guitar licks performed by guitarist Johnny Marr of the rock band Modest Mouse, but in general presenting little more than a set of moody, distant textures which almost lull the listener to sleep.    The action sequences that feature strongly in the second half of the album are dominated by bass-heavy motifs featuring Da Vinci Code-style staccato rhythms, throaty brass chords that build outwards from the Piaf motif, and muscular string writing which shares musical similarities with other pop-minimalist pieces from other scores, most notably Clint Mansell's Requiem for a Dream. These stylistics form the core of cues such as \\"Dream is Collapsing\\", the grinding \\"Radical Notion\\", the propulsive \\"528491\\", and the relentless \\"Dream Within a Dream\\", while the one standout action moment is the frantic, frenetic \\"Mombasa\\", which adds a layer of pulsating tribal-style percussion over the orchestra/synth/guitar combo, and provides a fresh sense of genuine excitement to a scene in which Cobb is chased all over the Tanzanian capital by rogue agents.    While all this sounds quite promising in prose, the reality is that, for quite significant portions of its running time, Inception is unexpectedly dull. Despite adding an appropriate internal tempo to a film in context, scores that rely almost solely on rhythm and texture suffer from a lack of personality outside it, and that is the case here. Whole minutes of score just drift by aimlessly, lost in their own musical fog, occasionally changing timbre, occasionally changing tempo, but providing very little actual musical content for the listener to latch onto. To make matters worse, the one truly memorable musical element - the Piaf motif - becomes so insistent that, at times, it becomes obnoxious to the point of being unintentionally amusing, accompanying every moment of revelation with an earth-shattering `whonnnnnnkkk' of doom. The latter half of \\"Waiting For a Train\\" is especially guilty of this, despite interpolating an actual sample of Piaf's voice into the score around the 7-minute mark. Christopher Nolan clearly has a penchant for simplistic thematic statements such as this, as the Inception motif is clearly a cousin to the Joker motif from The Dark Knight.    It's a real shame, because Inception is clearly a film filled with concepts and ideas which in other circumstances could inspire a composer to write truly great music. With a director other than Christopher Nolan holding the musical reins, Zimmer himself would likely have produced a score of greater scope than he has; clearly Zimmer was entirely influenced by Nolan's personal musical tastes and thoughts about how music and film work together, which is why parts of the score are as insubstantial as they are. Admirers of Zimmer's work on Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and to a lesser extent The Da Vinci Code scores, will find much to their taste in Inception. Others, unfortunately, will find themselves dreaming of a time when Zimmer actually wrote scores which linger longer in the memory - for the right reasons.
0321525655|4.0|This book is worth reading and I think it's also worth having, as it's own design is very good.  It provides useful knowledge on how to do presentations today, some years ago the rule of no more than seven words per point and no more than seven points was the way to go (still, if most of the presentations would stick to this it would be an improvement) but today that is no longer valid and I agree with that point.  Several ideas:  -Make a story board, do not start with the software that is guiding you in specific ways and all the slides are the same at the end.  -Don't put everything on the slides, perhaps you need to give handouts, made with Word or something similar.  -If you want to make an impact you should spend time in the presentation.  -Use good quality photos  -If you repeat what is written in a slide the comprehension of the audience is worse than if they just read or you just talk.  -How many time have you heard during a presentation \\"... probably you can not see this...\\". Then why do you put that thing in it? If you follow the rules of this book that will not happen again.  -Etc.    In general is not rocket science, nothing that you can not think by yourself, but I found the book easy to read, with nice examples, good advice and good design.   I have clearly improved my presentations just following some of the most basic ideas of the book.

If you have been paying attention for the last several decades you will find yourself shaking your head with recognition, agreement and with more than a tiny amount of disgust.  This should be required reading for anyone who makes economic or monetary policy in this country.  I found that I could only read two or three chapters at a sitting.  Any more than that and I feared my head might explode.  If you really want to understand why we are in this current economic mess then this is the book for you.

B002ZG999U|3.0|First, this was the WORST STORY I've seen in quite awhile. Just AWFUL. There's nothing at all compelling about it. Even the 2008 RAMBO remake had an infinitely more interesting and suspenseful story than The Expendables. It's like it was written by a 6th grader for a book report (yeah, I know Stallone wrote them both). We saw this movie the day after it opened and I counted no less than 6 people in our theater actually SLEEPING at various times before the final 30 minutes, when some action actually happens. There was even snoring 2 seats over from me! That's what a lackluster and forgettable storyline does to people sitting in a dark theater...It becomes VISUAL MELATONIN. It's really a shame too with such a great cast. Everyone brought their A-game to The Expendables, but they could only perform within the limits of the lame story.    For example, a 20 min (+/-) \\"recon\\" trip to the Latin American island by Stallone & Statham? Really, now...PURE FILLER! The ONLY reason this was even in the story was because they \\"had\\" to meet the General's daughter and expand their \\"cause\\". And that's 20 minutes that woulda, coulda, shoulda been spent having gunfights and blowing crap up! Instead, you have to wait until they're actually leaving the island to get any kind of explosive action. So then they go home, regroup and return to the same freakin island to finish the job they woulda, coulda, shoulda just done on the initial trip. And once they began their assault on the island, there was at least 5 minutes of film devoted solely to the various Expendables characters simply running around setting explosive charges to some over-the-top Hollywoodesque heroic musical score! Seriously...They just continuously ran around setting charge after charge. It was like you had filmed your kids for 5 minutes just running around the neighborhood in their new Halloween costumes. After the first 15 or 20 sec it was comedic, although I'm sure it was never INTENDED to be...    I was also duped intothinking Bruce Willis and The Governator were actually INVOLVED in the movie. Well, it was just HYPE. They have a brief meeting in a church and it's over. Stallone might as well have met with Spongebob Squarepants and Patrick Star in the church. So with that disappointment and the lame story continually failing to ignite any passion in the audience as well as the actors, The Expendables forever lost any chance to live up to the pre-release hype and actually be a 5-star movie.    There are only TWO things that saved this movie from a 1 or 2-star rating: 1) The final 30 minutes that had the action that the rest of the movie was lacking and 2) the AA-12 automatic shotgun used by Terry Crews' character, \\"Hale Caesar\\". The fistfights, gunfights and explosions that happen in the final 30 minutes when the real assault takes place is what woulda, coulda, shoulda been taking place during the rest of the movie instead of what seemed like endless, BORING dialogue between Stallone & Statham...Stallone & Rourke...Statham & his love interest...Stallone & Statham & the General's daughter......UGGGHHHH!!! Just over and over and over the plot DIED into pool after pool of merciless drivel.    Would I see The Expendables again? Well, I wouldn't PAY to see it again. As I said, the actors were all very good...Stallone and Lundgren were even exceptional. But Stallone has done enough movies that when he sat through a pre-release screening of this one, I wouldn't be surprised if he just stopped the film after 20 or 30 minutes and said, \\"C'mon guys...I thought we were making an ACTION FILM here!\\" Yeah, that's what I thought too. I really like all of these guys and saw them on the NYSE floor on CNBC a few days after the release just having a great time. And that FUN was what the terrible story here prevented from happening until the final 30 minutes. In fact, if you just walked into the theater after watching another movie and saw the final 30 minutes of The Expendables you'd think, \\"WOW! That must've been the BEST MOVIE of the summer!\\" On the other hand, if you go in at the beginning then you're likely to doze off a few times or even get up early and leave to go watch the ending of another movie in the same theater complex.     And that's what really sucks about The Expendables...It only delivers a partial dose of what woulda, coulda, shoulda been with a cast like this. This isn't rocket science. You've assembled a top team of testosterone-filled bodies. Get the opening credits out of the way, then give them big guns, lots of ammo and blow everything up in sight right until the final credits roll. Instead, we got a boring story and sporadic action until the movie was about 2/3 over. Assuming there's an Expendables 2, I hope they really do it up right next time...This was their \\"mulligan\\".
0061914177|4.0|While it probably isn't time for me to create a video blog on YouTube, the book is definitely a solid resource for creating an online presence.  Vaynerchuk has very effectively done his homework and built a brand around himself.    The book is a little self indulgently biographical, but it keeps the reading interesting.  Vaynerchuk's description of why he is an expert harkens back to Malcolm Gladwell's writing (10,000 hours to mastery); and certainly hints that we need to develop an expertise that adds value before trying to sell \\"something\\".    The book brings out some, I think, very important points about using technology to sell yourself as a brand as well as products.  We live in the middle of a very noisy e-commerce market square, and selling our own wares (and ourselves) is going to take some polished and unique messaging.

B000RJO578|4.0|I bought this movie on DVD and watched in twice before I realized that I really enjoyed it. The first time through, some parts I thought were just \\"stupid\\" but then I realized that the movie isn't meant to make any sense, really. It is SUPPOSED to be ridiculous, and with that mindset the movie becomes a lot more fun.    It does run nearly two hours, which is a bit long for this sort of film, but it's an easy watch. The story is a bit hard to follow -- especially when the whole \\"cult\\" thing starts getting explained, but upon repeated viewings it starts to make a bit more sense.    Some of the gags and jokes become more funny upon repeated viewings. The film degenerates into absolute chaos during the final 30 minutes or so, but the gun battles are fun in a ridiculous \\"nobody dies\\" sense. Or rather, not that many people die. Give the film a chance -- some of it is subtle British humor, other parts are slapstick.

B002WCLG48|5.0|OK, I've never played the game, or read any of the books (but I do have the 1st book here).    I really liked these stories.  I am also a fan of the Animatrix though too.    I thought they did a nice job in terms of alluding to how big the war is, but also including the human element.  I really liked the Duel in particular, because it was told from the viewpoint of the Covenant's side.  The stylized animation for that one adds to the story.    Also: Under Special Features, there is the Story of Halo So Far.  This is a key featurette.  I have mixed feelings whether I would recommend watching it 1st or after you've watched all the episodes.  Has a lot of key info in there that might help explain what's going on in the individual episodes as you watch them, but at the same time, maybe I got more out of this because I *didn't* understand as much and had to put things together myself as I watched the episodes.    Anyway, I really enjoyed this !!  Hopefully they do another DVD/BD sometime, and I really need to read that 1st book now ...  :-)

As stated, it has a more \\"electronica\\" sound than her previous efforts, but I feel that style works pretty well for her. She has a very unique voice with a range that has always impressed me, and she hasn't abandoned that on this album. I usually don't like electronica because I feel that the background music can overpower the singer, but that's not the case here. Whether you're a new or longtime fan, check out Aliz&eacute;e's new musical style...you just might end up loving it.
B00004SAAY|4.0|This is very peppy classical music to listen to. However, the actually album doesn't sound the same as the music that Amazon lets you sample online. You can tell that the music they have online and the music that is actually on the CDs are 2 completely different recordings. The sample that's online sounds MUCH better than the CDs.<br />But the CD's are still nice to listen to, just don't expect it to sound the same.
0061537934|5.0|This book is so delightful it will stay in my memory forever.  I bought copies for all of my friends.  If you have ever owned a very special, very smart dog, if you are still missing your own great dog who has died, this is a wonderful \\"what if...\\" story. It is not patronizing or \\"cutesy\\" and it explodes with a gloriously joyful conclusion that requires a box of tissues nearby. It is a well crafted story and homage to the intelligence of dogs, the ancient dog/human connection, and all of the dogs who have brought such happiness and service to our lives.
006123141X|5.0|This is the only James Rollins book I have read and consequently, my first and only Sigma force novel.<br /><br />I found it fast-paced and entertaining with varied plot twists, super heroes and a super villain.  Very good read.<br /><br />I did think that it sagged a little in the middle but not enough to go from a five star rating to a four star rating.<br /><br />The Sigma force team work hard to provident a nefarious plot involving contamination of the world's food supply traveling across Europe and the Eastern seaboard of the United States they battle the mysterious Guild and of course, at the conclusion, of this adventure, there is a hint of more to come.<br /><br />A good read when you are ready for an escapist novel!
B002N8A14M|4.0|This is a great product for the price.  The only glitch is the clip in the arm band.  It's a little difficult to release the clip from the arm band, otherwise, I love the fact that I can use the armband at the gym, and also use the clip in my waistband while working around the house of yard.
0061650498|5.0|The audio CD of a Tree Grows in Brooklyn was wonderful. I listened to it in the car and it held my interest all the way through. I highly recommend it!
B001AQO3QA|1.0|I canceled egg edition. ($149.99...) and I ordered regular edition. But $89.99? + tax = $97... Still expensive!!! Then I remembered UK version is cheap! and YES! about $50!!! Shipping is about $10. and region code free!!! I re-ordered it from amazon.co.uk!!! and I'm really happy! If you wanna save money, try this!!! :-)
1423113497|5.0|I really like the Percy Jackson set of books!!  I enjoyed the Greek mythology, gods, goddesses and monsters with a modern twist.  I found that I couldn't put them down, and was constantly wanting to find out what happened next.  I know they are supposedly written for young adults/pre teens, but I am 40 and enjoyed them just as much! I also ordered books 4 and 5 and am pleased with those as well.  My daughter will be reading them next. I will definitely be looking for more books to read by Rick Riordan!
B002MTTZ5I|1.0|If they werent trying too hard to fit ito the 80s Rock style,They might be somthing & sell some music????    The lyrics Suck badly! I know the 80's were all about sex & drugs,but these guys are just making a joke of the 80's bands,Or there just really bad!
B003QCCS36|5.0|I'll let the other reviews cover the intricate details of the release.  I just stopped by to say that this CD is responsible for making me believe in folk rock.  So much emotion in the delivery of each song.  Beg Steal or Borrow drew me in immediately the first time I heard it.  I'll have to look into Ray's other releases to add to my collection.    I'll be looking for Ray and his band to tour the East Coast.  As for my friends who haven't caught onto this type of music, I consider it their loss while I expand my musical horizon.
B0032TJH0A|5.0|I found this book soooo funny. It is my 13 yr. old twins book, but I read it when they begged me to. I'm in my late 40's and suffer from depression at times and let me tell you I busted a gut at certain parts. (sorry won't tell you what and ruin it for you) I loaned all the wimpy kid books we have to my 23 year old step-daughter and now she wants the whole set herself. I would have a hard time believing that anyone with a sense of humor would be disappointed. Worth every penney.
0375842209|4.0|My finding of The Book Thief was a bit serendipitous. Not my finding as in actually knowing about the book (since this book was highly talked about when I first joined Goodreads), but my actual finding of it...in the store. I was just entering the thrift store I frequented at the time (is there a better place but a thrift store to find books? I think not.) and I remember thinking \\"God! If only I could find The Book Thief in this place instead of having to pay full price for it!\\" (I was a broke college student then, actually I still am). And lo and behold, there it was! On the second shelf hidden behind yet another copy of a James Patterson novel. Oh, you would not believe how fast I snatched that book up (It was only two dollars, after all, for a hardcover in mint condition)!<br /><br />This happened about two years ago (or at least a year and a half) and I've only now just read it. Why did I wait so long? Because this was one of those books that was hyped up like you wouldn't believe. So many people were talking about the greatness that was The Book Thief. My expectations, which were already quite high, went through the roof. Of course, then comes the inevitable thought \\"This will never live up to my expectations\\" and so it kept falling further and further down the Mt. TBR. Finally, after two previous failed attempts at getting into the story (only made it to page 30 both times), I buckled down and said \\"I WILL READ THIS\\". And I did. While it didn't exceed my expectations (or reach them, but again I say \\"Through the roof!\\"), I will say that The Book Thief was a really great book.<br /><br />I loved that this book was narrated by Death (or The Angel of/Grim Reaper, whatever you want to call him or it--whatever!). The author could've taken the easy way out and had Liesel narrate the book. I'm certain that the flow of the events would've been done in a \\"normal\\" way had that been the case. What do I mean by normal? Well, a lot of the time, Death tells us the events that are about to come. He just spoils it for you (not really)! He'll just come right out and tell you what's going to happen in the next part because he's just not into building suspense or curiosity. That's kind of what I liked about him. For the most part, he was dispassionate. The events just were what they were. And then something would happen, which would make Death be in awe of humans; whether it be at their extreme capacity for evil or their extreme capacity for goodness.<br /><br />As a reader, I have much love for the written word (as I'm sure everyone on GoodReads does), so I could understand how Liesel found words to be completely beautiful, yet heartbreaking, especially since that's how I was feeling when The Book Thief ended. I was sobbing my eyes out through the last 150 pages. In fact, those last 150 pages were five-star caliber. It was the rest of the book that ultimately led me to give this four stars instead of the five that most people are giving it. I just kept thinking \\"Okay, this is pretty damn good, but am I missing something? Why am I not just automatically loving this?\\" In fact, I spent a majority of the novel in like. Again, it was the last 150 pages that made me fall in love. So, I took the majority of like and the rest of love, put it together and ultimately decided on the four star rating.<br /><br />So, pretty great novel. I personally think that it was a tad (just a teeny, tiny, tad) overhyped. But if you take out all the hype, you still have a tremendous novel that will touch and simultaneously break your heart. And really as readers what more can we ask for? After all, The Book Thief makes me value the written word that much more.come. He just spoils it for you (not really)!

B0012GMW7A|4.0|Various Positions makes an excellent gift to introduce friends to Leonard Cohen. They will have heard his music as backgroud on television shows but may not know who he is. Some of his lyrics reference Biblical themes so subtly many listeners will never notice.  Leonard Cohen is mildly addictive in a wonderful way.  His thought provoking songs are perfect for road trips or as background music for rote tasks.
B002ZG99G8|1.0|There are a lot of over-the-top booms and bangs here. However  they don't create any excitement or suspense at all. Partially, it's because I have seen them before. The acting is not engaging. After 30 minutes into the film, I was so bored that I almost walked out. The last fighting scene with the jet looks exactly like one from a James Bond movie. Yet, it does not act like a Bond picture.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production budget was $23,591,432.<br />However, its domestic gross was only $23,591,432. So, it's truly a loser.<br /><br />This is one of the worst movies released in 2010.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|3.5 stars.  I was highly entertained, but then again I was sipping on Lemoncello while watching.  I agree with other reviewer that this film is a combination of every catastrope film that you have ever watched before.  But truth be told, I sort of enjoyed all those that came before this as well.  I like that the last suspenseful moments are from our heroes screwing up, but I really didn't like losing the step-father in all this and am not at all sure that our main hero, Jackson, deserved winning his family back.  I think an ending of father and step-father accepting each other would have played better.  I mean, did the wife even miss her husband?  She just bounced back with the first husband like it wasn't nothing.  My main problem is the selling of tickets for such a major amount.  I mean, the currency won't mean anything in a world of no goverment.  Seems like having each continent invest in thousands of Noah Arks would have boosted the economy for the three years that they knew of the approaching end of days and they could have save a whole lot more people.  3 three years and 50 states building arks.  How is this a bad plan?  Some assistant being listened to as head of state?  There were a lot questionable decisions, but like I said with the right buss you will still find this great entertainment.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|The first disappointment with this movie is the fake 3D effects. They looked like scenes cut out of cardboard then put one behind another to create virtual depth. It's terrible. It was actually shot in 2D then \\"magically\\" transferred to 3D to cash in on the 3D fever.<br /><br />The second disappointment was the shallow of the characters  The ones in the original 1980 script moved me with their depth and human feelings. Of course the special effects of the '80 movie were laughable.<br /><br />The fighting special effects of this film were a mixed bag. In one hand, it's very impressive. For example, the giant scorpions looked scary, and  real. On the other it's disturbingly disappointing because the it was filmed so quickly and jerkily I could hardly saw what was happening.<br /><br />In short, it's a waste of money and time.
B0025T65GC|5.0|This album makes a fool out of me, in that I absolutely love it, but I can hardly do it justice when describing it. It took me a few listens in the right atmosphere to really appreciate it, as the first few times I heard it, it was in my car while going back and forth between home and work, and looking back after experiencing this album properly, that's definitely not the way to do it. I personally find it best enjoyed immediately after rocking something intense and emotionally draining like SYL's \\"Alien\\", then putting on this album and laying in bed with the lights off and headphones on to absorb every little detail of the music. This album brings emotional restoration in musical form - it's like liquid positivity pouring into your mind, and it's absolutely gorgeous when you're tired and kicked-back, and all you have to do is listen. There's a couple heavy moments on the album early on, and these moments act like waves that pull out whatever negative, stressed feelings you may have, and they make room for the rest of the album, which is beautiful emotional restoration that leaves you feeling wonderful by the time it's over. Dev really outdid himself on this album, and I can only hope that he creates more stuff on a tangent to this in the future.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I really love this cd I'm not even a fan of rap music but I'm almost gushing I'm so happy with this purchase. I listen to it every day and I can't get enough of Space Cowboy. Every song is a hit, if every eminem cd were this good I'd be a fan for life!!
0307454541|4.0|Larseen has written a very fine story.  The characters are nicely drawn and the book is an all-nighter if ever there was one (or three).  Summer is good time to read it although I suppose a cold December evening would make it even more riveting.<br /><br />What can one say with 1600 reviews on Amazon.  That alone tells you how popular the book is.  You really cannot go wrong getting aboard this train.  However I have to say that as a mystery-thriller or \\"locked room\\" as in \\"locked island\\" book, what doesn't quite work for me is the plausibility of the police involved in the investigation.  Their role is so minor (okay so it only works that way) and the type of cop-investigator who won't give up on the case is Blomkvist rather than the cop...but I find it difficult to believe that the police wouldn't have discovered the connections over such a long period of time.<br /><br />Second.  We all seem to be willing to believe that a hacker like Salander, and she's a mighty interesting character, is able to get into all kinds of systems a la the Wiki of the Defense Department on Afganistan papers -- perhaps I've ruined my own argument on that one.  But I think Larseen over does this technology deus ex machina a bit.  Especially in the final denounement.  I can't believe that it would be quite so easy to bring down someone. Having stated these two seeming flaws in the \\"Girl\\" I still find it damn good writing and wish that he'd survived to write more.
0446691437|5.0|Get out of your own way. An excellent book for anyone trying to create anything. A song, a screenplay, or a business.
B001TIQTFC|5.0|Very happy to get this back in my collection, even though its not vinyl. I'll live.
B002JVWR0Y|4.0|In most ways, this was the best season of Dexter yet. The writing seems to have gotten better. Gone is some of the annoying and misplaced music from earlier seasons. Unneeded graphic violence and language, seems actually toned down a little. John Lithgow as this season's main protagonist does an excellent job and brings some much needed acting muscle to the cast. The show's realism has also gone up a notch this season.  But not everything is perfect.  The side plots were fewer this season, and some characters carried no real weight. The love affair between two characters for example seemed like filler. But overall the season surpasses the others IMO.    MAJOR SPOILERS!!!    There are some interesting plot developments this season with Dexter rushing his method and killing his first innocent, and the seeming bit of guilt he feels. Dexter's father has taken on a Mitchell ala \\"Mr. Brooks\\" type persona, where Dexter communicates with him in his mind, rather then just seeing flashbacks. It was a nice and realistic touch to see the FBI come in and take over the Trinity case. For those that do not know, the FBI have a notorious and well deserved reputation as media whores and case thieves, and are hated by many in law enforcement. The physical and verbal family abuse by the Trinity killer of both his immediate family and Catherine, and their reactions, was well acted and provided some of the most gripping scenes of the season.   Some plot points harkened back to earlier seasons. Mirroring season one & two, Quinn seems to have replaced Doakes, as the cop who dislikes and senses something is wrong with Dexter. Also taking from season one, Dexter feels he can learn from the Trinity killer, similar to the way he thought he could from the Ice Truck Killer.    The death of Rita however takes the cake as the saddest and most shocking moment of the show. I don't think most fans saw this coming and I fear it was premature if the show intends to last more then another season. The Rita character was one of the best acted on the show and provided Dexter with an excellent partner. More then just a lovable character, I think the show has lost a real asset. If the writers wanted to do this I think they should have waited until the last season. It will no doubt provide some strong plot points for season 5, but once those are resolved, I fear the show will be left with a gaping hole.
0446563048|5.0|While this books is unlike _Good to Great_ in that it isn't really analytical, it does offer some significant comparisons between the \\"normal\\" way of doing business and the Zappos way.  I found the read thought-provoking and inspiring, although I did notice it took about 10 years for Zappos to reach profitability.  It is unlikely that the typical small business would be capitalized well enough to last that long!  I, for one, would rather take a successful business and \\"fold in\\" the execution of a  Zappos-type philosophy, one customer-oriented change at a time, and this book should help in that regard.
142314189X|5.0|Move over Harry Potter - there's a new boy-hero in town!<br /><br />Despite drawing several comparisons with the Harry Potter season - which is logical when you think that the initial premise is the same (boy discovers he's special, goes away from home to learn more about these skills, makes a couple of good friends, gets into adventures and ends up fighting against a seemingly undefeatable foe).  The difference between this series and the Harry Potter series is that Riordan updates Greek mythology to both educate and entertain.<br /><br />The story focuses on Percy, a boy who discovers that he's a demi-God - and what a demi-God, a child of one of the \\"big three\\"... He also discovers that someone is trying to start a war between Gods and, when that fails, destroy them by any means necessary.<br /><br />With five individual stories, linked together by an over-arching theme, these books are entertaining and feature a variety of mythological characters that have been updated and made to fit into modern society.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read for fans of any book series - Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, etc...
B00005AG7K|5.0|Comment: This is one of those \\"offbeat\\" movies I have loved over the years. I believe I have owned it on VHS and DVD format. I remember watching it on analog tube 4x3 TVs without any problem with the picture quality. When I watched this newly purchased DVD on my state of the art flat-panel it looked like it had been projected onto dried corn leaves and then recorded off of that. Very shocking and unsatisfactory. I have looked for an upgraded \\"special\\" copy but up till now haven't found one. Maybe in the future there will be a Blu-ray upgraded version. (yea... I know, don't hold my breath and not in my lifetime.)
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Ever since this movie came out, I have heard people talking about how good it is so I finally decided to watch it! This movie really did the trick of catching my interest!          The movie starts out with Dr. Gordon and Adam waking up in a dirty old bathroom and chained to pipes in opposite corners, with a dead man holding a pistol laying in-between them! After finding tapes in there pocket and receiving instructions on how they can get out, they must unravel the clues and escape!        One of the best horror thriller movies I have ever seen I can't wait for Saw 2 to come out! I wan to play a game!
B003XU7VM4|4.0|I just finished HEAT WAVE. Just a fun story. A fun read.  It's only about 196 or so pages and I was able to finish it in two days.  I liked that it read like the CASTLE TV show. I kept picturing the actors playing the characters in the show as the characters in the book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The initial set we received was missing 1 DVD, so I contacted Amazon via email and I got a very quick response: a replacement set was mailed immediately (1 day delivery) with no shipping charges. Great customer service, as always!  My husband loved the set and watched all the DVDs in just a few days!
B00001ZTFZ|5.0|Not exactly what you might expect from MegaDeth but that's why it was named Risk. Great stuff.
B000YABIQ6|2.0|Upon hearing all the hype about their new (4th) season and all the awards, I checked out Season One at the library to try and follow it from the beginning.      As there is a dearth of good drama on tv, I wanted to become a fan, but each episode left me with an empty, dissatisfied feeling, which I blame on the writing.      Many of the sub-plots are simply preposterous, e.g., the lead character stealing the identity of his dead G.I. colleague - right, like he's going to come back to his platoon suddenly claiming to be the other guy (and that he himself died), and no one will be the wiser.  Absurd!    Most all of the major characters are non-sympathetic, so that you're not rooting for anyone, they're all bad (or vapid) people.  The Pete Campbell character I can hardly stand to look at.  Only a few peripheral characters seem to be relatively decent.    I realize normal people don't make complelling television, but it's a too cynical view of the business world; you've got to have some balance.  Some of the scenes are just too over the top: morally revolting (Roger Sterling and his ingénue playthings) and even cruel (Don Draper's treatment of his sympathetic half-brother).    Second Season?  Not interested.
044508376X|5.0|Recently I discovered a serious gap in my fiction collection, one of the important novels of the last century. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" did indeed live up to its reputation as an outstanding American novel, not afraid to take on an important social issue and showthe nature of the prejudice that had (and still has) infected our country. Well written, an important read.
0316017922|5.0|This is the Second time I have bought this book. The first book was borrowed from me before I even finished it..... it made its way thru the family and now is being passed around to friends. \\"Outliers\\" is marvelous, and I can well understand why it has stayed on the best seller list for so long. This book was my introduction to Malcolm Gladwell, and now I look for everything he writes. I will start reading this again, from the beginning, and with any luck will be able to finish it before someone borrows this copy, too !!
0545123283|3.0|I adored Shiver...read it in only one day. Linger did just that....it went on and on and on. I had to force myself to read it through to the end. I genuinely appreciated the authors ability to make you feel the characters. I tried to remember that as I forced myself to finish the book just hoping something is going to happen to pull it all together. Well....it happened all right. In the last 3 pages. The ending was the best part. Authors method of switching between characters was almost too choppy and caused some serious confusion at some parts. Probably won't get excited about next installment. But I need to finish it so I'll probably end up getting it anyway.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Great movie for many reasons.  Top notch acting for one - Gary Oldman plays a brilliant and explosive evil genius as a foil to Leon's methodical emotionless professionalism and slavery to routine.  The story is engaging - you're drawn in to Matilda's plight very well, and the resulting decision that Leon has to make regarding his relationship with her and how that affects his life as a hitman.  The director remembers to have a sense of humor along the ride which adds another surprising dimension.  Looked great on blue ray, though wouldn't say it's necessary.  Wholeheartedly recommended.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|DC Comics I love, however, their past movies (Though I loved Green Latern : First Flight)seemed to lack some things... however.....This movie surpased all.     Marvel can never compete. I'm not sure if DC comics's movies (before this one mind you) were just too scared to add new characters? Well, maybe this will be a sign for them, keep adding! However, the movie was really short, but that's why I guess they added the extra episodes(?), to make it better. (Longer movies are more win, and these aren't going out in theaters, so I don't see why this one was so short)     It was a great story, and they added Nightwing! ('Bout time) However, I was somewhat dissapointed they didn't add Robin (Tim Drake), it could have easily added more conflict for Jason and bought more time, but for what ever reason, they didn't. I'm still very pleased with this movie.    I bought it twice to get the special Red Hood figure my local best buy offered.     Great plot, great animation, I'm very pleased with this movie.
0061205699|5.0|If you are like me and remember the movie more than the book, or if you read the book long ago, you may not realize how much of the book focuses on Atticus as a parent. He is a great role model as a father, always looking ahead to how what his children do now will shape them in the future. I'm sure this was read as \\"permissiveness\\" at the time, but the wisdom is apparent if you pay attention.    The story of Boo frames the story, his continued, protected innocence as Scout and Jem are ushered out of their own innocence by Atticus and by the events of the story.    A great book -- deserves all the praise it has gotten.
B003O85W3A|5.0|It's going to stink waiting for new Arcade Fire material now. I burned through their three albums in less than a year, and now it's going to be a while until the next one. Oh well, guess I'll have to find another indie band to obsess over for a while.<br /><br />If I had to rank them, I'd put The Suburbs behind Funeral and ahead of Neon Bible, although the important thing is that they haven't messed up yet, and their sound continues to grow and evolve as they figure out what kind of band they are. Bible had much more obvious musical influences than Funeral, while in The Suburbs you can still feel the effect of previous work on the songs, it's much less blatant and gives it a more timeless quality. It's sort of a compromise between their first two albums in a way, a bit more mature than Funeral but more down to earth and apolitical than Neon Bible. I'm very excited to see where they continue to go from here.<br /><br />\\"The Suburbs\\" and \\"Ready to Start\\" are a perfect one-two punch to begin the proceedings, full of energy and the band's unique flair. \\"Modern Man\\" is a more mellow track, but it keeps it interesting enough. \\"Rococo\\" didn't amaze me at first beyond a couple elements, but it's actually turned out to be perhaps the most insidious earworm on the album. \\"Empty Room\\" is the first song on the album sung primarily by Regine, and a catchy one. I like Win just fine obviously, but I think they both have a lot to bring to the table, and it was a bit disappointing when she only really sang half of one song on Neon Bible. She shows up more here, and it's fun.<br /><br />\\"Half Light\\", the first of two two-parters, is a pretty nice pair of songs, and they're followed by \\"Suburban War\\", a pleasant track in its own right that transforms itself with a minute and a half to go in a pretty awesome way. If the album has a weakness, it's the four tracks after that before the intoxicating \\"Sprawl\\" I and II. They're nice songs, doing their own unique thing on the album, it's just that they kind of make the whole thing seem a bit overstuffed, and if there were just two of them there instead of all four I think it would flow better.  But anyway, \\"Sprawl\\" is awesome and the final track brings everything full circle. It's a great album that might have been better with a bit of trimming, but I can't really complain about having more Arcade Fire songs, can I?
0143105566|5.0|This is not one of Graham Greene's most famous books, but I think it's one of his best.  Like many of his stories, it sets up a tension between a big historical drama and the personal drama of a relatively minor actor within it.  And as in others of those stories, Greene refuses to resolve the tension.<br /><br />The plot involves a British Military Intelligence agent, Castle, who, while stationed in Africa, falls in love with a black South African woman, Sarah.  In order to stay together and marry her, Castle makes a deal with the devil -- he agrees to become a double agent, passing along western intelligence to Soviet KGB agents.  He regards the intelligence he is passing along as inconsequential, and the deal is worth the risk, given that it is the only way to stay with Sarah, and Sarah's young son, Sam (fathered by a black South African man).<br /><br />The \\"devil\\" he makes his deal with, though, is not really the KGB.  It's really with the whole system -- MI5, South Africa, KGB, and the Cold War altogether.  He tries to negotiate a life for himself within that big structure of ideological war and espionage, and of course, he knows that the life he negotiates will never be at peace.  There will always be the danger, even inevitability, of being found out.  When that happens, the negotiations must start again.<br /><br />In all of this, the issue is, which stage is the one that counts?  The stage on which Castle lives his personal life, his domestic oasis with his wife and son, or the political stage on which he lives his double-agent life in the midst of international tension and cut-throat espionage.<br /><br />On one stage, Castle is a traitor, but on the other he is loyal, even heroic.  As things come unraveled, he says to Sarah, \\"Well, I'm what's generally called a traitor.\\"  And Sarah answers, \\"Who cares? . . . We have our own country.  You and I and Sam.  You've never betrayed that country . . .\\"<br /><br />Greene himself served in the British Secret Service.  This book and Our Man in Havana reflect, to me anyway, a recognition that the international intelligence game has a special kind of irrational autonomy.  From one perspective (much but not all of Our Man in Havana) that autonomy is farcical -- vacuum cleaner designs can pass as weapons intelligence.  But from the other it is pointlessly destructive, especially of the ability of normal people involved in it to live normal lives of everyday virtue.ce.

B003JTHETY|2.0|From the useless \\"mission edition\\" with mediocre bonus web content, that will probably be gone in a year or so, to the awfully muddy/underwater sounding production. This whole disc seems to have been rushed through. It's truly a shame since a good portion of the songs are pretty good, aside from the useless 4+ minute intro to the cd. Maiden is still @ their best live and hope they will continue that tradition for many years to come. DO NOT waist your $ on the Mission Edition!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0156030306|4.0|An excellent story about intelligence and emotional life. It's the story of Charlie (\\"Charly\\" in the movie adaptation), the apparently successful subject of an experiment to build the intelligence of a retarded man. But as Charlie's intelligence grows, so do the complications of his emotional life. The story is as much about his growing self-awareness, and the problems that brings, as it is about his intelligence.    It's certainly readable as merciful that Charlie's intelligence, and his emotional issues, fade, as he returns to the life he had before his treatment.    Algernon on the other hand . . . .
B003OF3R0S|4.0|The REV will be missed, but the replacement drummer Mike Portnoy (previously of Dream Theater) does an awesome job bringing the same fast-paced in your face metal. This album is much like their preceeding self-titled Avenged Sevenfold, but fresh enough that it doens't seem like \\"the same old stuff\\".    Recommended to any metal fan that has a clue what good music is.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russell Crowe does a splendid job in this big budget period epic, playing the Roman General Maximus. Maximus is tapped to be the next Emperor of Rome. Predictably, he is betrayed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar's blood-progeny (shades of DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS). The spineless Commodus is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who devours his role with relish. Commodus sells the general into slavery, after which Maximus ends up a gladiator in Rome.<br /><br />Crowe's performance is dynamic, even given that he growls his way through most of his dialogue. The action asequences are exciting, appropriately gory, and (as far as the Roman histories tell us) historically accurate. Rome was a culture where brawn outweighed brains in value, and social standards of behavior were tied to an Emperor's own idiosyncrasies. In GLADIATOR, the Thinking Man (represented by Marcus Aurelius) is displaced by the Mob, who crave nothing more than bread and circuses (represented by Commodus). Maximus, a warrior-poet straddles both eras.<br /><br />In terms of story, GLADIATOR inevitably samples much of Kirk Douglas' 1960 masterpiece SPARTACUS, the story of a slave-gladiator turned liberator. For those who have never seen SPARTACUS, GLADIATOR will be an original treat; for those who have, the older film is still a stronger draw, with better performances, more memorable characters, and far superior sets (no CGI cheats).<br /><br />Crowe acquits himself well, and in his desire for a Rome ruled by laws, Maximus is a not too far distant cousin to Spartacus, the spokesman for human dignity. Given my choice, I'd watch Kirk first and Crowe second, but I'd want to own them both.

B002N5N5M0|2.0|I am a huge fan of the first 3 seasons, but I'm really disappointed in this last one. I could go on and on about what I didn't like about this season, but I can boil it down to this. Seasons 1-3 were masterpieces in dark humor. In season 4, the humor is gone and only darkness remains. I won't spoil it for you, but I also hated the last minutes of the last episode: seriously depressing.

B003QCCS36|5.0|We loved this album! My favorites were Old Before Your Time and Devil in the Jukebox. The music is a little different and I really enjoyed it.
B003JTHETY|4.0|I preface this by saying that the majority of this review is not about the music itself. The music is amazing! Absolutly brilliant. The extras, not so much. Aside from a twenty minute interview video with the band about the making of the album, there's not much there. The other \\"special\\" video is the director's cut of \\"The Final Frontier\\". That has been availible for free on the website for about a month. The wallpapers are all screenshots from the video. Not that I didn't put one on my desktop. The pictures are all from the Dallas, TX show in June of '10. No making of, no other band pics.     It's only a dollar more than just the plain CD, so get it. Just don't get to excited for the extras. You will be disappointed. The music is great. You will love the pure Maiden sound. If it wasn't for that feeling of disappointment in the extras, I would have given this five stars!
B003JTHESA|5.0|Normally I don't bother to write reviews, but after reading some of the 1 star reviews from some of the IM \\"fans\\" on here, I felt compelled to throw my hat into the ring.  Now, first things first... if you are a fan of any of the previous three IM release, then you will thoroughly enjoy this album.  The Final Frontier blends the styles and songwriting from Brave New World through Matter of Life and Death, and adds it's own unique touches and flavor to the classic Maiden sound along the way.  Yes, this album takes a few spins to really absorb everything the band is throwing at you, just as the previous 3 releases did, but once again it is a grower and I've found myself spinning it constantly since I picked it up on release day.    I'll be honest... I was a little worried after hearing the first single \\"El Dorado\\", released just before Maiden embarked on their latest tour, that the album's production would once again sound sub-par and muddy like DOD and AMOLAD's were, but thankfully this is not the case for the final product.  Bruce's vocals can sound a bit strained at times during the long choruses, but for the most part he knocks this one out of the park.  The triple guitar work is excellent... much more pronounced in each track, and has a much thicker and richer sound this time around.  Steve's signature galloping bass is right there in the midst of it all, and Nicko's drumming no longer sounds like he's beating on a cardboard box.    Each song stands out in its own right, something that I had a problem with on the last album, as many of the tracks were tough to distinguish from each other, even after repeated listens.  I'm not going to go into a track-by-track review as everyone has their own unique take and personal favorites on every album, so I'll just give an overview of what to expect.  The first half of the album is a mixture of straightforward fast-paced and mid-tempo rockers, with an almost ballad-type track added to the mix.  The title track features a sing-along chorus that should be great to hear live.  The second half of the album is just the opposite, featuring epic after epic averaging nearly 9 minutes in length.  It is here that you will begin to discover what this album is all about, and some of the best Maiden epics ever written.  \\"Aisle of Avalon\\", \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\", and \\"When The Wild Wind Blows\\" are some of the best stuff Maiden has put out since their 2000 reunion, and I cannot wait to hear them live the next time they come around.  You owe it to yourself to give each of these tracks (as well as the entire album) a thorough listening to.  They are right up there with \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", and other such staples of Maiden epicness.    The Final Frontier is simply Maiden's best release since Brave New World in terms of production, quality and songwriting... I'd even go so far as to call it BNW 2, with some nods to DOD and AMOLAD of course.  Not an awful track in the bunch, though some of the songs do suffer from \\"BNW syndrome\\" with the overly-repetitive choruses.  That's about the only knock I can really give this album.  To those of you expecting a return to the so-called classic 80's Maiden sound... hate to burst your bubble, but it just ain't gonna happen.  But if this album is any indication, Maiden are going to be with us for a long time to come, and that is something that EVERYONE should be thankful for.  Now go buy it!!!
B000094HMU|3.0|Yes...this is a grand production,with huge everything...sets,scenery etc.,but as a finished product I'm not sure this is the best of the best.  The singers are fine, and they even act well.Ms. Mitchell built a good career,a lot of which was devoted to her role as liu, which she sang all over the world.Domingo is fine-a big role for him,but despite a failure to navigate a high C- a note that he has never had anyway,his work is very good.Marton has the vocal power and a pleasing enough voice.Plishka looks, plays, and sings the part wonderfully.Ping,Pang and Pong are just right,with Ping offering a truly beautiful baritone.The orchestra led by Maestro Levine is adaquate,but not thrilling.Part of the problem, on a metaphysical level is the ability of anyone or anything to match the Zeffirelli stage.But,the general failure of the highly touted Metropolitain opera chorus to command it's role in this production astounds me.The first tenors missed \\"fuggi.fuggi-only one being sung, and sounding like one tenor at that! The following \\"Va Va\\"...Va Va\\"is flat and amateurishly sung.Now this is a live recording and I do understand that fact-still, cues are cues and proper technique is proper technique.During this Met chrorus' history waeknesses were often evident, whcih were worked on under new direction,but I've always felt the Met chorus to be highly overrated.Believe me, having sung in the chorus of this opera,the role of the chorus is of prime importance.You may also notice a big voiced lead soprano, with a rather aged and wobbly attack.I spent time on the chorus here because hardly anyone else does.  It was an OK production,but give me the Corelli,Nilsson productions hands down every time.None has ever matched the power and beauty of sound.Imagine- they did it without a Zeffirelli set and a budget only God could afford.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|We went to Scotland this summer and saw where this movie was made.  We knew we had to purchase Braveheart.  We did not see this movie when it was first released.  This movie captured our attention for the entire 3 hours. It was an epic war movie and worth watching.  It was quite vivid.  I would recommend this movie, however it is not for the faint of heart.

B002BSHWUU|3.0|In my lifetime I have purchased the entire Beatles catalog 3 times and am now on the fourth--and 5th because I had to buy the stereo and mono separately.  I hope someone from EMI reads these reviews, because i want them to know that fans such as i deserve more for our loyalty.  We have made them millions many times over and just want to say that for once i'd like to feel that I wasn't being turned upside down and having the change shaken out of my pockets. Why can't we just get a real quality bargain and have both the mono and stereo on one CD?  Fans know that mono and stereo Beatles can be very different, and you can argue all day about your preference, but I think there is something to recommend each, so I want both. Just my little gripe.    Secondly let me say that if you are wondering whether you should bother buying these because you already have these albums on other discs or vinyl (like me), let me reassure you that it is worth the purchase.  These sound far better that the old cd's and better than what you can get on even the best quality vinyl.  The packaging is also up to the event, and is very pleasing.  I like the mini album replicas of the mono and the tri-fold sleeves of the stereo. There is a lot of great art work and liner notes.  The new packaging is just as important as the improved sound to me and nearly makes the purchase worth it by itself.  For the first time the sound and packaging is worthy of the Beatles.  I don't understand how they let it be so bad for so long with music that is so important. Magical Mystery Tour never even had the original comic with it until now.  I think if all cd's were packaged this way--more like record albums--they would be a lot more fun and people might not do as many downloads. My one little suggestion to EMI is that the stereo set could use the clear plastic protectors and inner sleeves that came with the mono set.    Having said all that, let me say that the sound--though vastly improved--isn't as good as it could be still.  When you compare these discs to your old ones you will be thrilled.  However, compare \\"Lucy in the Sky\\" from the remastered \\"Sgt Pepper\\" to the one on the \\"Love\\" cd and you may be a little (though not terribly) disappointed.  That is because these are remasters and not remixes.  Whenever I hear Beatles songs in modern remixes I am astounded at how much better they sound.  Listen to the Anthology, Yellow Submarine Songtrack or Love and you will start to hear what is possible.  What we have here is the best possible copy of the old mixes from the 60's (except for Help and Rubber Soul which were remixed for the original cd release in the 1980's).  Purists would argue not to mess with history and art, and i concede they have a point, but when i hear the sound on the \\"Love\\" cd I wish all Beatles cd's could sound like that.  It may be that some art should be hermetically sealed and never touched or fiddled with and preserved as a museum piece,  but this music needs to live and be heard, so i say let the fiddling begin and let's hear it as good as it can be. The technology is there EMI, now use it.  Listen to Paul's voice crack on the lame stereo mix of \\"If I Fell\\" (our new love, was in vai---) and you'll wonder why they don't fix it. After all, the stereo mixes of the first four albums were considered too awful for cd release back in the 80's.   Now that they are newly remastered, flaws such as this are only more obvious--and alarming.  It took EMI 4 years to complete this project and they couldn't be bothered to fix such a glaring problem?  They fixed the tambourine drop out in Day Tripper for the \\"One\\" release--why not this? Paperback Writer still begins all on one speaker! Come on! EMI stop cutting corners with the Beatles!     Overall, this is pretty good and is the best we will have for long time so you should get it, but it's not everything it could've and should've been for a band as important as the Beatles.  I would give 3.5 stars, for the improvedsound and packaging.  I can't give it five, because I can't help but feel that EMI is still holding back--probably for another more \\"improved\\" release 20 years from now.  Built in obsolescence you see.
B001NXDIMK|3.0|What drew me into season 1 was Ellen as the innocent pawn who quickly learned and adapted. I started watching season 2 hoping to see her continue to play in the dirt but try to keep clean. That didn't happen and left me without an interesting character to follow so I'm not planning to watch any more of the series.    I think to be interested in Damages you have want to follow a story of power plays taking place in a legal fantasy land. Do not start watching Damages if you are looking for even a semi-realistic portrayal of the legal system. The legal system is just a setting and everyone is corrupt. Or, in the show's words, \\"nobody can be trusted.\\"    Despite my problems with the story, the acting is top-notch. The combination in my opinion makes for an average TV show. That is to say, Damages is on-par with other legal soap operas available to you to watch.    If you do watch Damages and are having trouble following the story, just quit watching the flash-backs and flash-forwards. They are only there to mislead you.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This series was not ment to be a history lesson.  It was meant to give the feeling of what it might have been like to have actually been there, something you will not get from any history lesson.  And it succeeds in accomplishing this better than any other production about the Pacific theatre in WWII has ever done.  It follows three Marines through their service in the Pacific to the experience of returning home and trying to adjust to life after the war.  And, truth to be told, it is in fact history, it is just not the kind of history most people are used to.  It goes far deeper than the date and place type of dry history many folks may be used to.  Some folks complain about errors in the story, but I defy anyone to find a non-fiction work anywhere that does not contain some inacuracies.  No one is infalable, and no work is perfect.      It seems that a lot of people were offended by the racist elements in this series, and seem to even believe that those sentiments did not exist.  The racism was in fact there, and was strong on both sides.  Posters made by the war department actually depicted the Japanese as being monstrous creatures with fangs.  This is a fact.  Oddly, some of these folks seem to have racist leanings of their own and perhaps are offended because it touches a nerve that they do not have the courage to admit exists.  What ever the case, if you want to get a sense of what it was actually like to have been there, this is by far the best production you will find.  If you want purely history, try reading a book.

B0001ARCFA|4.0|The AKG K240 Studio Monitor headphones are a pair that every musician, recording hobbyist and lover of sound and music owes themelves to try. They produce a soundfield much broader, accurate and detailed than many headphones sold at this price, and are incredibly durable and comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I've gotten 10 years out of my first pair (they still work!) and recently picked up several other pairs for my studio. Many musicians i work with are swooned by their own performances the first time i let them monitor with these. A common reaction upon first experience is to quickly check to make sure the studio monitors aren't on too, as the stereo field is that life-like. This is due to the semi-open design, which allows the sound to breathe much more than just get piped into your head.<br /><br />As far as the type of tone you get from most headphones, i've found that many cans sound really unbalanced. Sometimes the mids are blaring, boxy or occasionally non-existent. The bass response in headphones is commonly hyped up beyond realism and the highs cut off right at 20khz. While this is fine for most material on CD or most mp3's, modern recording mediums have transcended the 22khz 'wall' of what was once believed to be the peak of perceptible hearing. For what it's worth, these headphones accommodate that extended range, with sound reproduction capability 15-25,000hz (more of a feeling than a sound that low or high). This is perhaps part of the reason they sound so broad and natural in monitoring situations, or while listening to HD audio from Digital Radio or DVD's, for example.<br /><br />I own many other brands of headphones, including a few pairs from Sennheiser, Grado, Sony, Denon, and Audio Technica. The type of headphone you get for this price-point is usually lacking in overall detail and stereo definition. The closest two pairs i own in quality and build are the [[ASIN:B000065BPB Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones]] and [[ASIN:B000G3LCQC Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone]]. Sennheisers HD280 pro are aimed at recording professionals, and they pump bass and overall volume more powerfully, but the spectrum seems rather dramatic, with more of a scooped frequency response that dips around 2khz and pulls up below 90hz and above 6khz. This makes everything sound more 'excited' but not very accurate and fatiguing after more than a few hours. It is worth noting that the HD280 pro's are closed back, and designed to fit really snug. The AKG k240s's by comparison are more natural in tone to my ears, less powerfully slanted in the bass but accurate both in translation to other speakers and in terms of the stereo field. Grado's offering in this price range fare much more favorably; with a less excited low end, perfect midrange definition, and are likely a better purchase than the Sennheisers, but i still prefer the AKG's broad and open sound stage presentation and fatigue-less wearing.<br /><br />There are some negatives to these headphones though. The semi-closed back design means that these headphones leak sound at all volumes. this means that using these at high volumes in places that require relative silence is an impossibility. Conversely, they won't block out the outside world all that well either unless turned way up. Using them in recording situations in proximity to microphones can be an issue, and the power requirements are higher than most portable amplifiers provide. In fact, you may even find yourself wanting more volume out of your laptop or computer's soundcard. I'm currently listening to them through an M-audio fast-track pro audio interface and have the volume at about 95%. in my studio, where i have a dedicated headphone amplifier i don't have this problem, but at the computer i occasionally hear material even at full volume that just isn't loud enough. If you plan on using these primarily with a portable audio setup, i would consider the power of your jack carefully before making this purchase.<br /><br />All of this said, The AKG k240 Studios are a staple of my home and studio listening arsenal. True, you can find better headphones out there, but not for this price. In fact, you won't find a better pair for double this. Do your ears a favor and try these headphones.G k240 Studios are a staple of my home and studio listening arsenal. True, you can find better headphones out there, but not for this price.

B003JTHESA|5.0|There's going to be a lot of complaints from the old timer crowd as they long for the older sound. I have enjoyed every album with the exception of the Blaze what's his face years. If you like the 2000 and newer albums you'll like this one. The songs are long and the lyrics are what you come to expect.     There are some fans Maiden is just not going to please until they decide to throw some red meat their way much like Megadeth did with their latest release.     I suggest streaming this album. I found it on youtube, and it can be streamed there. I streamed it, decided I liked it, then bought it. I'm glad I did.

0439023483|5.0|Sometimes when I approach a book for the second time I pause for a moment and wonder, \\"What if I don't like it as much this time?\\"  THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins was no exception - but within the first few pages that feeling was immediately squashed and, once again, I found myself swept away by the story.<br /><br />Knowing what was going to happen in the book did not dull the message much at all for me.  I remember being horrified my first time through the story and that horror was still there, but a bit muted.  I still cried; when Katniss does the unthinkable for love of family, when Rue cries out for help, when Peeta learns of Katniss' true feelings.<br /><br />I'm not really much of a Team Girl - but I've always learned a little more toward Gale.  I like strong characters (and Katniss is a female character I've begun to compare all YA females to).  Peeta still comes off as weak to me, helpless.  This time I read through the story and found myself wondering what Gale would have done, were he in the same situations.  Would he have survived?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is very talented.  She can take a 350+ page book and make it feel like it barely is 100 pages with her ability to create momentum, suspense, a fantastic world that you are able, almost immediately, to grasp.  Her descriptions of the food in the Capital had me drooling and I'm not even close to being in the same boat as these teens from District 12.  The imagination behind Cinna and the costumes; the strategy of the games - everything is put together so well that, once started, I can't imagine anyone putting this book down.<br /><br />This book goes on the yearly re-read list for me. It's one of those stories that will make your imagination jump around like a 5 year old who has eaten too much sugar.

B001SS3JS8|1.0|I don't think I have ever read anything so ridiculous in my life!  So not worth your time. I wonder if this writer has ever known a teenager in her life. I found myself just laughing at the stupid reasoning in this book that tries to make you believe the plot. Chris has got to be the worst boyfriend a girl could ever have. His girl friend wants to kill herself and he goes along with it because he thinks she'll just do it anyway. Not that he should help her and believe that she could get past all her troubles. He supplies the gun! I have suicide in my family and I find all of this offensive. I was hoping the Chris would go to jail just for being such a jerk.   For real!!!  Can anyone believe this stuff???  I can't.  Don't bother.  I can't believe this got published!!! Anyone who has been touched by suicide should be outraged.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|wow is literally all i can say about this &#34;book&#34;. bar none the worst &#34;writing&#34; by any mainstream &#34;author&#34;. every &#34;line&#34; drips with his desperate &#34;need&#34; to draw in and impress the &#34;reader&#34;. YOU CANT BE THAT SARCASTIC, people lose respect after the first twenty sets of air quotes! i am also assuming editors are out of style? too many grammatical errors to count. dont buy this book
B001HN6940|5.0|I have read some bad reviews on this movie, but I'm glad I bought it just to see for myself. Great & beutiful effects and color. The plot was somewhat awkward, but still a movie I'd recommend... Looking forward to 3D version cause I know this movie had some great comming at you scenes.
0307454541|5.0|The  book is practically mind blowing ,so hard to put down. I would recommend this to anyone who love a good mystery. Surprises at every corner.
142314189X|5.0|I have not picked up a storybook in a bit of a while and as a matter of fact until this set I used to say that I didn't like to read made up stories as I have been more likened to factual information like in Encyclopedias until I read this set of books.  Once I started reading the Lightning Thief I was hooked and could not stop reading these stories until I have finished reading all five of them.  It was one of the most exciting stories that I ever have read and would tell anybody that if they have not read it yet that they are missing out on a once in a lifetime experience.  Don't just take my word for it, I dare you to read just the first chapter of the Lightning Thief and then try to not read any more.
0307454541|5.0|At first I questioned if I would like this book. The beginning is a bit slow. But once the story takes off, it has wings. At times I couldn't put the book down. Highly recommended.
B00005JLEX|5.0|We LOVE Seinfeld and bought this and gave it away as a gift.  It's a perfect birthday or gift idea, we love it.  It is the gift that gives lots of laughs.
0545123283|2.0|******SPOILER ALERT****I was luke warm about Shiver, but it piqued my interest enough to read the sequel.  I'm sorely disappointed that I did.  I felt the second book to be almost useless in moving the plot forward since by the end of the book, the main characters are in the same predicament as Shiver.<br />The main characters' relationship is stagnant at best with no real interaction other than at night so I really didn't feel any grief or pity at the end when they were separated, once again.  The supporting characters were more enjoyable to read, but even by the middle of the book there was no change to their monolouges from those at the beginning. The story didn't move forwards, rather several steps backwards to the beginning of the first book.<br /><br />Also,the growing trend of absentee, out of touch parents in YA novels hit an all time high, or should I say low in Linger.  While the hypocrasy of the parents is staggering, I worry that the message teens are getting is that teens can make the best long term decisions for their life based purely on their emotions and hormones, as depicted in this novel.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|The Losers kept me on the edge of my seat with its action from beginning to end. With its Mr. & Mrs. Smith overtones, the scene with Zoe Saldana and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the hotel room, justifies the price of admission all by itself. Chris Evans as Jensen and Columbus Short as Pooch, plus the fine newcomer Oscar Jaenada who plays Cougar round out the cast wonderfully as each is a vital element to the story line. The characters vibe so well with each other. A great surprise was the sexy Idris Elba, whom I adore. His character Roque showed he is more than capable of playing a believable bad guy. His acting is so terrific he made me dislike Roque immensely. The interaction between Aisha and Clay set up the necessity for a sequel, and I sure hope it doesn't take forever to come to fruition. This movie has become a treasured part of my DVD collection.
B0007TKNCY|1.0|Just finished watching this and I hated it. I normally like Grant and Hepburn, but here they have little or no chemistry and little in the way of direction. A fairly promising beginning decends into an unfunny mess. The plot is non-existent. The script is worse and the over-acting is idiotic and just embarrassing. (Barry Fitzgerald was never funny anyway.)An undeserved reputation.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|I started watching this season Friday and completed the series on Sunday. So many twist...the ending?! I'm hoping Dexter is dreaming. I keep thinking what can they come up with next, and the creators never let me down.  The HD is excellent. The picture is one of the best. In fact, its better then most movie releases. Five stars for the audio too.
B0017I1FP8|2.0|This review is short and to the point.<br /><br />This soundtrack was just a lot of noise and hardly any music.  The opening bars of the first track is a preview of the entire soundtrack - monotonous single-toned industrial noise.  If you like industrial music then this Soundtrack is for you, but if you are actually interested in listening to music then don't waste your time to buy this Soundtrack.<br /><br />Most of the scores open with a relentless droning then just stops in the middle and there is silence for one or two minutes and then the relentless drone re-commences, builds to a crescendo (which becomes painful to the ears) and then fades away, but the listener can't be sure if they should be thankful that its the end of the torment or just a momentary lull.<br /><br />This Soundtrack was painful to listen to.  Very chaotic with more noise than music.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I never write reviews, but felt compelled after the ratings were skewed by all of the whiners who are complaining about purchasing the first Volume. The truth- anyone with the sense that God gave a billy goat would have used their deducing skills, and realized there would eventually be a full season release. I mean, really, what show doesn't have one?! All of you guys were simply too eager and impatient. Shame on all of you for inaccurately reviewing Glee.    As for the show, I think it's fantastic. It does a great job of satisfying my Musical Theatre needs with songs like \\"Maybe This Time (Cabaret), \\"Don't Rain On My Parade (Funny Girl), and \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" (Les Mis), as well as Broadway actors like Matthew Morrison, Lea Michele, and guest stars like Kristin Chenoweth, Jonathan Groff, and Idina Menzel. Alternatively, mainstream artists like Lady GaGa, Madonna, and Kanye West are showcased as well.    And for the most part the writing is pretty good, but I'm sure the shows 19 Emmy nominations can speak for that.
B001E52O7M|5.0|Kim and Mauborgne's approach to strategy is refreshing. Instead of measuring yourself against the competition, measure how much value you can create for your customers. The book is in three parts, first describing what is a \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\", then how to define it for your business, and concluding with how to implement it. The second part of the book is what impressed me the most: the step-by-step process of zeroing in on what I call your \\"secret sauce\\", the specific elements of the value you bring to your clients that set you apart from everyone else. It is the best book that I've read so far that lays out a logical and demonstratable process to identify this. The authors provide many real-life examples to illustrate each aspect of the process. The third part of the book, on overcoming internal barriers to implementing the BOS in an organization, lays out the pitfalls that await a change leader, along with tactics to overcome them. I would have liked the examples to be a bit more varied for this third part.<br /><br />Full of practical and real-life examples, the authors have convinced me of the power of this approach to business excellence. Now all I have to do is to get my colleagues and my clients to agree to the process, too...<br /><br />This book was surprisingly quick for me to read despite the depth of the subject. Highly recommended both for startups and for existing SMEs who want to become the go-to provider in their field.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I use 3D Connexion, Standard Edition, with Google Earth, usually in conjunction with the regular mouse. It's a lot handier than the mouse-driven controls alone. I use my left hand, and although I'm right-handed, the device works smoothly and easily.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are less heavy on the base than most Sony headphones, so they are just as good for listening to talk radio or audio books as for music. The open design allows for unobstructed hearing of ambient sounds, making them perfect for places and times where you need to be aware of your surroundings.
B002ZG97RY|1.0|I had hoped to enjoy this movie in the Blu-Ray format to unfortunately find that the disc won't go beyond the Universal icon at the beginning of the disc.
B003L20IJM|5.0|This is as good, if not better then the first Nanny McPhee.  We really enjoyed the movie ( the whole family - Mom & Dad, Children, Grand Children, and Great Grand Children ) all at the same time. Nice to see movies like this come out.  Robert Wenger Sr.
0316067598|5.0|This was an enlightening read. I simply did not realize the extent of physical training and conditioning these men willing go thru to be a Navy SEAL.<br />This book takes you from Marcus Luttrell as a young man desiring something special, seeking out a mentor to teach him and completing the grueling training necessary to become a SEAL.<br />I simply rest better at night knowing men such as he are protecting us from those who would kill us without a second thought. Marcus is not xenophobic or racist but realistic when he talks about the Taliban. He gives credit to his opponents when due, but does not deny his feelings about them and their mission.<br />You do not have to be a military expert to read or enjoy this book. It is written so that non-military folks like myself can understand the lingo.<br />The pictures of the individuals in the book are located in the center and are of great help in putting faces and names together.<br />It is truly sad that these men lost their lives and Marcus Luttrell's life is forever changed, but Marcus is busy trying to establish a ranch for returning servicemen to visit/live to ease them back into post war life.<br />All in all a fitting tribute to his team mates he lost and with whom he served.<br />Thank you Marcus Luttrell and all others like you for your service!
B003E8AF5U|5.0|If you don't enjoy this album, you don't have an educated taste in music. Sorry to be blunt, but it's true- Plain and simple.<br /><br />It took me three consecutive listens to appreciate this wonderful modern masterpiece. Give it your open mind, full attention and your patience, and it will pay off immensely.<br /><br />This is one of the best records of 2010 so far, no question. If you enjoy any form of melodic, psychedelic pop/rock, Congratulations will blow you away.<br /><br />I mean, Godforbid, the worst thing that could happen is that you might LIKE it. OH NO! HOW HORRIBLE!
0440246016|4.0|Last year I stumbled across Jack Reacher at a used book store in Myrtle Beach. Loved the character and the story found in \\"Nothing to Lose\\". Well 12 months later I'm heading back down to the same beach, and decided I would bring along another Reacher novel and picked up \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\".<br /><br />This story was even better than \\"Nothing to Lose\\"!!<br /><br />When one of Reacher's old army buddies reaches out for help, Reacher immediately heads out to California. It seems someone may be targeting Reacher's old crew of MP investigators. Assembling the surviving members Reacher and his crew set out to find out who, why and how.<br /><br />The action is fast paced, and as typical to a Lee Child novel, the narrative flows easily off the page, even a slow reader will crank through the novel in a day or so. The twists and turns are fun, the characters great and the villains vile. If you haven't read a Reacher novel yet, this is a good one to pick up. You get a bit of background on Reacher and instead of loner on a mission tale which is the norm more often than not, Reacher shares the spotlight with a few others making \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" a stand out from quite a few of the other entries in this series.<br /><br />Highly recommended for readers who enjoy a little bloodshed and testerone with their thrillers/mysteries.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|An incredible simple movie that did not take a huge crummy hollywood movie budget to make. The atmosphere the director created was perfect. I feel a bond to this movie, and like Satyricon, and Apocalypse Now it is one of my favorites. A strong recommendation for people who are looking for real movies and hollywood's big budget crap.
0439023483|5.0|I read this at the request of my teen daughter and was surprised that I couldn't put it down. This is a book for all ages. Well written and it's a great story. I went on to read Catching Fire and am waiting for Mockingjay to come out tomorrow.

1401323820|5.0|This book is a lot of fun, especially if you are a fan of the series.  Of course we know it's a marketing ploy for the series, but who cares?  Knowing the actors gives you a reference for what happens in the book.  I think anyone who appreciates the humor and the by-play on the show would also like this.
B003RNXIBK|2.0|I've been a huge fan of Eminem for a long time. But this CD is just not that great. I went up to the mountains today so this is the CD that was playing for the ride. I swear it felt like one LONG song. Every song sounds exactly the same and it seriously began to get on my nerves.<br /><br />I'll just stick to the old Slim Shady.
0316017922|5.0|I received my order only 5 days after I purchased it, which was quicker than expected.  I also received emails letting me know that my purchase was made and when my order was shipped.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|**4.5 Stars**<br /><br />This is without a doubt Avenged Sevenfold's most personal album, dedicated to the late Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan. Perhaps it's for this reason, but this album is tighter, stronger, and more passionate than any of their other albums. I personally would argue that City of Evil and Waking the Fallen are better albums, but it wouldn't shock me if many fans consider this their best.<br /><br />The songs are loud and good, nothing but clean (and grind your face into the ground) rock with heartfelt lyrics dealing with the death and loss of a loved one. Perhaps the most ironic thing about this is that it seems a lot of the lyrics were already written before The Rev's death. I'm not entirely sure on this but it does appear this way.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare\\" opens the album well and while the chorus does end with that dull, cliched, and uninspired line \\"It's your f--king nightmare!\\" it's forgivable when the rest of the song is so good. I had high hopes for the album right when I heard this and the rest of the album was more than satisfying.<br /><br />The end of that song quickly leads into \\"Welcome to the Family,\\" which has a real catchy vocal track. So far they've been playing it at all of the shows thus far on the currently ongoing Uproar Festival Tour and it's bound to be a concert staple. It's not only a fun song to listen to period, but I can see it lyrically being just the perfect song that speaks to a crowd and gets them riled up. (\\"Hey kids! Do I have your attention?/I know the way you've been living/Life so reckless, tragedy endless/Welcome to the family.\\")<br /><br />\\"Danger Line\\" is a blazing scorcher of a song. This is one of the best pure straight up rock songs on the entire album. The ending is really cool and inventive as well. Some might think it to be out of place, but I really liked it and thought of it as one of the higher points on the album.<br /><br />\\"Buried Alive\\" is for the most part a much softer song that picks up midway, but it never really gets too loud or heavy. It's a beautiful song about feeling lost in a world of stress and pain and trying to escape.<br /><br />\\"Natural Born Killers\\" is another heavy song with a lightning fast opener that rarely lets up. Mike Portnoy's drumming really shines here and makes me glad that he was the one to record in Jimmy's place. I don't like it nearly as much as the majority of the other songs on the album, but that isn't saying much because this song is still likely to draw a strong fanbase, just like the rest of the material here.<br /><br />The most beautiful track would certainly be \\"So Far Away.\\" If any song was more dedicated to The Rev's memory, it'd have to be this one. It's probably the most direct about losing one you love dearly and the pain that comes with it. It's probably my favorite track on the album but...<br /><br />Coming in a close second is \\"God Hates Us.\\" It moves in so quickly from \\"So Far Away\\" and with such a soft opening (it sounds a lot like the first minute of \\"Buried Alive\\") that the first few times I listened to the album I almost thought it was just a continuation of the last track like some songs were in previous albums. But then 45 seconds in and it just starts pounding at your ears. I'd say this is probably their loudest and most aggressive song since their material off their first two albums. A lot of reviewers say this is the best track on the album and without a doubt it definitely is one of the better ones.<br /><br />\\"Victim\\" is a heavy but very melodious song, continuing the general theme of the album in a much grander and epic sounding way than many other other songs. I think that the song that follows it, \\"Tonight the World Dies,\\" were written almost to be companion songs, because they often feel it.<br /><br />After those comes the now infamous \\"Fiction\\". Originally titled \\"Death\\", it was the final song written by The Rev and turned into the band as the last song for the album before dying tragically 3 dayslater. It's a gentle yet dark song about finding peace with yourself, and I believe that this is one of the few songs where The Rev's vocals were left in.<br /><br />\\"Save Me\\" is a lengthy but perfectly epic and gargantuan closer to such a strong album. I don't think they could've ended this album in a better way.<br /><br />If any fan of the band is disappointed by this release I'll be honestly a bit amazed. Like a lot of today's albums, it doesn't leave a large impact on the first listen (unlike some of their earlier albums), but it hits hard and you can feel what they wanted this album to be about. Not just in their lyrics, but in the music itself and in the beautifully passionate way they play it. This is music that comes from the heart and it's definitely one of the best rock releases of the year thus far.<br /><br />I had my worries about this album, but along with other modern mainstream rock band Korn's latest release, I found those worries completely erased once I popped in the disc. I truly regret not preordering the Book of Nightmares special pre-order edition. I don't think that this is a better album than City of Evil, and maybe not Waking the Fallen only because of the atmosphere that album had that most of their others lacked, but it's certainly their strongest effort and not one, but at least ten steps above their last self-titled album.<br /><br />If you didn't like the last album, give this one a shot. The worst that'll happen is you'll have lost an hour or so of your life and maybe a few dollars in the process.

B000002KHH|5.0|The Amazon review is kind of condescending, but the fact is this album is brilliant and a perfect product of 1970 - chaos in the world, chaos in art media - Paranoid fits right in there - dark flower of the times.  War Pigs with it's lambasting of politicians and generals who start but don't fight in wars - and their day of reckoning - a TRUE Sabbath classic..      Paranoid follows that.  Third track \\"Planet Caravan\\" is a melodic and slower piece to round out the frenetic \\"Paranoid\\" and it's a nice little tune with fine undistorted lead playing over a piano, bass and Osbourne in the melancholy background. Good.  It's nice to take an album as a whole rather than just it's highlights sometimes.  Iron Man follows that and then the haunting Electric Funeral, mass nuclear doomsday where lights are not necessary cause all the dead people glow! Electric Funeral, a nice mix of demented gloom for a while before Ozzy and co break into a punkish jam before sliding back into mass radiation and general damnation.     Hand of Doom is another mellow (or not!) twisted blues track following the WINNING formula of this album and so much early Sabbath - fast/slow, loud/quiet. The sheer variation of not just tempo and speed, but volume and tone as well, put these early Sabbath tunes just outside the realm of so much other bonehead metal and offer a glimpse into progressive rock at it's early intelligent best.      Sabbath was dark but appealing, and there's something of the insane child in Ozzy's vocals that just gives it the right kick.  Rat Salad (a non-vocal prog jam) and the all-out cruncher Fairies Wear Boots seal the album's classic status.       In a nutshell, this album rocks from start to finish. Highly recommended.

006123141X|2.0|Flaws:<br /><br />  1)  You must read the prequel -I'm sure there is one which I won't read- to thoroughly understand this book.<br /><br />  2)  The book has 2 plots. You can skip one of them from beginning till the end and you'll miss nothing.<br /><br />  3)  The story you can read is so long-winded that sometimes you'll want to ditch the book... do it.<br /><br />  4)  You won't believe what would be the key... but that was what it keep me going... ditch the book.<br /><br />  5)  Too many persecutions with the same guys so I think JR wanted to write many pages.<br /><br />  6)  If I write other flaws this review will be a spoiler, so I won't.<br /><br />P.S: I know is hard to write a book, I did it twice but I only gave them to family and friends I couldn't publish them. So I never put 1 star to a book but I was very tempted with this one.

B002QVOPYI|5.0|Arjen Lucassen's Ayreon has long been one of those projects that brings together the best artists from bands around the world and gives them an outlet for one cohesive story that spans an album and in this case two.  The \\"Universal Migrator\\" series is a must have classic now apparently packaged together in a 2 disc set...as well they should be.  What a great price for two incredible discs!!  Sweeping, futuristic, mesmerizing and epic are all words that come to mind.  Listening is definitely a journey and in the end isn't that what we are all after?  The two discs are perfectly complimentary in their differences, the first being more symphonic and progressive in nature and the second kicking it into high metal gear with near unbelievable wizardry.  Prepare to be dazzled by some of the most talented metal and progressive artists that have all come together on such an immense project.  These discs were in rotation for me constantly and led to my picking up of Ayreon's back catalog as well as anything else Arjen has been involved in!  New \\"Star One\\" disc anyone??  Oh.... yeah!
0393072231|5.0|Lewis creates a wonderful narrative around a few characters outside of the Wall Street culture who saw the sub-prime bond market for what it really was; a giant ponzy scheme setup by Wall Street and the Ratings Agencies. If you ever wanted to learn about the inner workings of the 2008 Market Crash from the perspective of those who really saw disaster looming, this is the book to read.     At times the book does become pretty techinical - specifically the inner workings of a CDO or the complexity of the sub-prime bond market and credit-default swaps - but I think Lewis does a great job explaining things that many Wall Street couldn't understand.    I also think this is a great book to read if you think homeowners were the ones to blame for the 08 crash. By the end of the book, I would be surprised if you still hold that opinion. Lewis does the best job I've seen of debunking that myth.    Overall, this is an incredible read. I haven't read any of Lewis's other books, but I've already ordered [[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]] and [[ASIN:0393324818 Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game]].
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I picked up this CD a few years ago after \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Bottle It Up\\" managed to get stuck in my head. When I first listened to \\"Little Voice,\\" I found it agreeable enough, but was not overly impressed. However, this is CD for which my appreciation has grown as I continue to listen to it. It is one of the few albums I listen straight through to, rather than just placing them on shuffle in iTunes or on my iPod.<br /><br />Each time I listen to it, I am reminded of what an excellent whole this album is. Though the well worn songs mentioned above that received lots of radio play show a more confrontational side to Bareilles, the CD itself is composed of a fascinating combination of different emotional states.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Between the Lines\\" and \\"One Sweet Love\\" offer a more poignant, reflective viewpoint on relationships, for example. \\"City\\" and \\"Vegas,\\" on the other hand, offer a powerful look into the emptiness and difficulty of being a performing artist. Because the CD is anything but one sided, I have found that different parts of it have \\"spoken\\" to me at different times, varying which track is my favorite.<br /><br />In all, \\"Little Voice\\" was one of the strongest albums released last decade. It is subtle and understated in such a way that I suspect anyone who gives it several listens will find it grows better each time you hear it. If you haven't picked it up already, you shouldn't hesitate to do so now.<br /><br />By the way: if you can find a copy of the Deluxe Edition, that is the best way to go. The additional \\"Stripped\\" EP is a pleasant mix of acoustical versions of tracks from \\"Little Voice\\" and a few additional non-album songs.
0895260131|5.0|Guess what!  Islam is not a religion of peace.  Islam condones murder, lying, and stealing, in order to advance its own cause.  Islam's codes of conduct only apply when acting towards other Muslims.  Islam teaches that women are inferior to men and have the status of slaves.  Islam condones slavery.  All of this is in the Quran.  Verses of the Quran do not have a context.  The verses of the Quran mean exactly what they say, in isolation, a point also made in Spencer's other book, \\"The Complete Infidel's Guide to the Koran\\".  According to the Quran, murder is less evil than persecution.  By persecution is meant any hindrance to the spread of Islam, such as telling the truth about Islam.  Muhammad was the first Islamic terrorist.  His band frequently raided pagan, Jewish, and Christians tribes.  Islam's cardinal rule of diplomacy has always been: treaties are made to be broken.  Policy makers need to always keep this in mind when dealing with Islamic countries.    The moral philosophy of Islam is the same as that of communism: the end justifies the means.  Think of the implications this has for contemporary issues.  Before I listened to this audiobook, I was under the assumption that Islam shares the conservative values of other monotheistic religions.  It does not.  For instance, I thought that Islam condemned abortion and homosexuality.  But what would jihadists really think of cooperating with the Left in promoting partial birth abortion and gay marriage?  Well, since it destroys Western society, it also advances the Islamic cause and therefore is justified.  So Muslim extremists can with good conscience promote the denigration of values which they would not allow to happen in their own societies.    Reconsider even the question that Obama is a Muslim.  I used think that's rubbish, because Obama's social values clearly are not Islamic ones.  Moreover, Obama was born a Muslim and therefore he is now an apostate deserving of death.  This last statement is quite true.But if Obama by promoting the destruction of values, by promoting gay marriage and infanticide, succeeds in destroying American society, and if Obama also by pretending to be a Christian pulls off an act of deception which blinds us to the truth and thereby aids jihad, his actions are from the point of view of Islamic jihad entirely justified.  Obama is certainly also helping jihad by appeasement.  So Obama could after all be a Muslim, and people's prejudices could be right after all.  And while this does not logically follow from all the evidence, it is not at all far-fetched.    And consider the level of sexual immorality also taught in the Quran and the Hadith.  It's ok for Muslim men to fantasize about a sexual paradise with as many virgins and young boys to fornicate upon and sodomize as they please.  Islam is a carnal and sensual religion just as much as it is murderous.    Finally, consider what Islam has in store for the civil society.  They want America and all other free republics under Islamic law and the Constitution of the United States scrapped and replaced with Sharia.  They want Americans, Europeans and people of all nations who refuse Islam to be forced to pay a cruel tax wherein the act of payment itself involves floggings and humiliations.  It is their supreme strategy for growing converts, and it works.  In the short term, their subjects choose to pay the taxes and endure the misery, but in the long run it is inevitable they will convert.  To promulgate the treasonous ideology of Islam in the civil society is treason; it was not historically considered protected by freedom of speech, and it certainly does not deserve the sanctuary of freedom of religion.    It is time that we stop making excuses for Islam.  Embassies need to rethink their alliances.  Islam killed, kills, and continues to kill.  When Muslims claim they are for peace, they are just buying time, like they always have.  It is not enough to attribute Islamic atrocities to Islamic extremists; we must acknowledge that Islam itself is extreme.  A Muslim who denies his own duty to wage holy war in the way of Allah must, if he is not a liar, be a liberal Muslim who believes the Quran is a myth, in very much the same way as a Christian who denies resurrection of Jesus must be a liberal Christian who believe the Bible is a myth.  In other words, terror is in the mainstream of Islam.  It is time that free people wake up!
B001IF252C|3.0|The product, which was a good bargain from the seller, is a bit of a conundrum in Apple's line-up of mini DisplayPort adapters. It's really only needed if one has a 30\\" Cinema Display, for which is delivers bright, crisp images on the massive display.     Yet, even with its dual-link nature, it doesn't work well on single-link, DVI-equipped monitors, nor does it work with a dual-link DVI to HDMI adapter on HDMI-equipped monitors. For the former it's overkill; for the latter, a cheap mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter works equally well (or not, depending on which version of MacBook or MacBook Pro you have).
B0015DROBO|3.0|I enjoyed reading Stieg Larsson books.  I am on my third and final book by him.  I will miss reading more written by him.  I have one comment about these books.  I treat my Kindle the way I treated my books.  They did not look like I have even read them because I have respect for my books.  My Kindle however downloaded this series to my Kindle with many highlights in the series.  I don't know if this can be corrected but if so please do so.
0142406112|3.0|Rate: 3.5     I've been hooked with spy novel as of late; Anna Campbell, Evelyn Salt, Annie Walker or Chuck Bartowski might have slight influence on the whole thing but I am just generally fascinated with the whole espionage business. The mystery, danger and drama of it all provides great entertainment. Young Alex Rider here is no exception, in fact he is completely awesome, i still cannot get over that whole fiasco on that metal grinder. I keep thinking this could not be happening, maybe I am missing something and Alex is actually a cyborg or a half breed of something but no, it was all teenager with great spy skills passed down by his uncle without him knowing it. Agood start of a great series. Can't wait to read book 2.

0553808001|5.0|This calendar contains a beautiful rendering of just about every major castle in the ASOAF series, and each and every one of the castles does two things:  1) it meets my expectations in terms of the particular detail built by GRRM.  2) They exceed my expectations with regard to the overall beauty of each castle. The artist is amazing.  While every one is incredible, I think Castle Black is my personal favorite.  I'm excited to actually use the calendar once 2011 rolls around.

1400031567|5.0|Kurt Wallander is a detective in Sweden who is intensely involved in his work, to the extent that it interferes with his private life. In this exciting and very well-written book, he comes up against a depraved serial killer who scalps his victims. Additionally, he and his colleagues are trying to discover why a young girl pours gasoline over herself and commits suicide by fire in front of Wallander.<br /><br /> The killer strikes several times, and the investigative team is baffled by the reason for the selecting of the particular victims. Other police forces are enlisted to help, and even though the hunt goes on for that killer, Wallander hasn't forgotten the girl's grisly demise. Add to that the fact that the crimes were committed during the time when the detective force members usually are on extended holiday, and Wallander has to balance his upcoming vacation with his new lady friend with the fact that he may not be able to go. Of course, he doesn't have the heart or the courage to call his lady and tell her what's happening.<br /><br /> On top of all of that, his father is showing early signs of Alzheimer's disease, and insists on a trip to Italy with his son. All in all, it's a busy time for Wallander, and the book reflects that. How he and his team pull everything together is a case study in dogged detective work, and is amazingly interesting to the reader. All of the Wallander books I have read have been excellent, and this one just adds another to that list. If you haven't yet discovered Kurt Wallander, do yourself a big favor and read these books.
4789004546|4.0|This is the best Japanese grammar that I have found and I have searched quite a bit. Despite the title, thebook is quite advanced compared to many other grammar books out there. I can't see how you can do without this book. In addition, the authors have written [[ASIN:B001PS7NL0 A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar]] and [[ASIN:B001GOVW4M A Dictionary of Advanced Japanese Grammar]] as well. So if you get through this book, there are two more :)<br /><br />Each entry is written in a quite structured, academic manner. We get several examples of usage and extensive usage notes. That is what I like.<br /><br />However, I absolutely hate the overall organisation of the book. Why should a grammar be organised from A to Z? For other languages, grammars are organised in a topical manner; one section on auxiliary verbs, one on particles, one on adverbs, etc. (Try to find a comprehensive grammar that doesn't follow A to Z!!!) This causes two problems:<br />1. It is not very helpful for learning. If I want to understand say time related adverbs. I want them all on one page. I don't want to have to go through a dictionary to find them all.<br />2. Some topics are not at all suited for A to Z. I'm talking about verbs forms and their usage. As a consequence, verbs get a very shallow treatment.<br />For these two reasons the book only gets four stars.<br /><br />Other thoughts<br />1. Kodansha is spitting out small books about vocabulary and grammar. Many quite good. Still, that never ending stream must make them quite a bit of money. The Japan Times publisher has no such vested interest. So if you're on a budget, even more reason to get this book.<br />2. I don't know why the book is sold out on amazon. There are loads of them in my local bookstore. My version is the 61st printing so it is not out of print.<br />3. One promising alternative that I will check out (published in 2011) is \\"Japanische Grammatik\\" in German by Markus Gewehr. Generally Germans write very structured grammars. That approach should suit Japanese grammar.e grammar.
0316548189|4.0|Nelson Mandela has become an icon of human freedom throughout the world. His intelligence, astute awareness of human nature,  perseverence and sheer determination to stand against the \\"enemy\\" of injustice and cruelty is an example for all of mankind. His autobiography is an excellent chronicle of his life, his aspirations for his country and his sacrifice to attain those aspirations. I have come to admire Mr. Mandela all the more through his book. While I do not necessarily agree with all of his philosophies and ideas, I found myself rethinking some of mine. This is a thought provoking read.
B00005RDSM|4.0|because the cover style, I thought it was going to be a modern animated movie, but it still uses the old style with no \\"Great\\" colorful quality image. But it is ok for children.
0307346617|5.0|This book is awesome....the author has such an awesome imagination and vision!!!  I highly recommend this book not only to zombie lovers but to all who are sick of reading the same old stuff  A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B000P0J09M|5.0|I give the movie five stars because the acting was good, the Northeast mood was captured well, and the unpleasantness was well illustrated.  As a lawyer, I wouldn't defend Henry Hill if my life depended on it.  If the movie is accurate, he lead all those men to their death to save his own skin when he could have warned them to blow town.  He lead them to Jimmy Burke to get killed and probably blue the whistle on Tommy Disimone to save his own skin.  Just as he was in youth, he was as an adult.  The price he paid to be alive today left a trail of blood that was unnecessary.  If he was any man of principle, when Jimmy wanted him to lead those guys to him to get killed, or when the Gambinos were going to \\"make\\" Tommy, he should have informed the future victims and went to the authorities.  But, he didn't.  That's probably why he looks like a strung out drug addict, musing about the trail of destroyed lives he left in his path.  That's, of course, dependent upon the assumption of him having a conscience.  Maybe his addiction is just another manifestation of his compulsion to self gratification.  He had best repent ask Jesus Christ to save him from his sins.  If he had no reservations about ratting, why couldn't he rat in such a way that he and everybody could have lived?  He's just too selfish.  What glory is there in that?
0307454541|1.0|I hated this book. Was the author a pedophile, rapist, or just a psychotic with sick violent sexual thirst? I almost threw it out after the first vivid sexual assault and should have known it would continue under the guise of a murder mystery. This book is a cover for somebody's demented hunger for sexual violence. Cant believe this is a #1 seller, I wouldn't recommended this book to my worst enemy. And movies to come??!! Why would people want to spread this kind of crap to the rest of the population, it only feeds into creating a more unstable dangerous society.
B002RSDW80|5.0|If you are feeling blue and down in the dumps because you're always working and never have any fun, then this is the movie for you!<br /><br />This film is about a woman, who is bored with her career and her extremely successful and well-to-do friends, so she decides to start cooking!<br /><br />Her inspiration? Julie Childs' cookbook, of course!<br /><br />Her objective: cook all the recipes in 365 days and blog about it!<br /><br />This is an excellent and fascinating movie--set in two different time periods!<br /><br />I highly recommend it! You'll be glad you bought it!
0156027321|5.0|This is my favorite book. Sometimes I love it purely for the storytelling, sometimes I love it as a parable, and sometimes I love it because of how it reflects my own faith. And who couldn't love a story about a boy and a tiger stuck in a raft together?
B001FB4W16|5.0|I have heard such good things about True Blood, I had to watch it to see what I thought.  I LOVE it!  I whizzed through this season and, lucky for me, I went right into season two since I had bought both together.   This HBO series is a winner.
0156711427|5.0|The book was shipped immediately and arrived at my door very quickly.  Product was exactly as described.  Buying used books online is so much less expensive than buying them from the bookstore.  I appreciate the amazing service!
0061777250|5.0|This book presents a case for the authenticity of the near death experience. Based upon evidence from prospective and retrospective studies, the author argues that consciousness is not completely dependent upon the brain and that subjects are sometimes able to experience a greatly magnified awareness apart from the body. Anyone who has an open mind and is not religiously attached to materialism will probably enjoy this book.
0307594777|4.0|I finished the first book after watching the Swedish version of the movie.  It wasn't until toward the end of the book where there were changes in the two stories that made it more interesting to read.  I won't watch the other movies until I've finished the books.  The stories are great.  The value of the bundle was great.  The book were brand new and packaged nicely.
030726999X|5.0|Read the first two, had to read the final instalment.  Great book.  I highly recommend it, but you must read the first two books before reading this one, otherwise you will not be able to follow it.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|A foreboding tale about the future or are many elements present in over-crowded cities and environmentally challenged planet today? A classic Harrison Ford shows the figurative and literal dark side of survival and how we value our humanity; striking a balance between what's demanded of us to endure in society, the price of human greed, and how much we value the interactions that define us.
7885142434|2.0|I'm disappointed with this order. It looks like a bootleg copy- The translation is not precise (even in English), the movements are slow and I have a good lcd tv. Wish I could return it But I can't. I will not order from this company again. The movie itself isn't bad but I liked the first Ip Man more. Donnie Yen is incredible.
6304698690|5.0|There have been many versions of \\"The Secret Garden\\" filmed but this is a feast for the eyes and ears in it's lavish settings and costumes. Excellent video for viewers of all ages, for those who love gardens, and for those who fondly remember this enchanting story from their childhood.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|I tried watching this on TV.  I could not say which edition but the tonal background music was in a pitch that was giving me a headache.  It tended to overlay the dialog, which in some cases seemed to come out like a mumble.  I could have done without Hollywood's idea of background music.  It is really not necessary to have tonal music running through an entire motion picture.  OK if you are not bothered by the pitch of the music.  Otherwise forget it.  I turned it off part way through and switched to something else.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian Wilson is the greatest living american composer, hands down. For those who equate Brian only with the wonderful music of the early Beach Boys (Catch a Wave, Little Deuce Coupe, etc) this may seem like a major departure from some \\"formula\\". For those who have followed Brian's career throughout the last decade, this is as good as anything he's released, including Orange Crate Art and maybe even SMiLE. Brian tackles a body of work that has been \\"tributed\\" over and over again and brings it a fresh, SoCal approach that works on all levels. Brian was the Beach Boys, so for anyone to suggest that he's tried to replicate their sound here, that person just doesn't understand that the sound IS Brian's. \\"I Got Rhythm\\" is a classic take that will stand the test of time. \\"The Like In I Love You\\" is another fabulous track that he actually received permission to finish from the Gershwin estate.  Buy this CD, buy one for your friend. You'll be giving them a real treat!
B0026S1XDM|5.0|I began my appreciation of Mike Oldfield with this album when it was originally released - as an LP. I've had it on casette and CD (all three have been worn out!). The new edition provides crisp, clear audio, and of course the content remains as terrific today as when it first came out.<br /><br />Since then, I've collected every Oldfield recording I could find, including some foreign editions. Some is repetitive (Mike does have a habit of re-examining and re-issuing earlier works), but they remain a pleasure. To be really appreciated, one needs to sit and actually LISTEN to the recording. The depth is astonishing.
B003X27L9U|5.0|This is an amazing work.  Telling the story in first person, from the point of view of Jack, a five year old who has lived his entire life with his Ma in an 11 by 11 room, with a completely believable voice.  This book gives us much to ponder.  Frame of reference, security, love.  It's difficult to review without giving too much away.  I'd knock some tenths off for a few parts that seem less in character, or a bit too pat, but the book as a whole is a magnificent journey that will make you think, make you feel, and you will be better off having the experience.
B000HEVALC|1.0|This is an interesting CD, but the quality is poor and it is difficult to pick out the singers.  To have these four together at one time is great, but if you did not know who was on the recording, you would think it was mostly an Elvis session.
0971407614|5.0|This book is just what you want if you don't want to spend a lot of money and time on expensive training programs. Your \\"weights\\" is your own body. And you can do all the exericises at home, without expensive equipment. This is an exercise scheme that actually works. I have only been using the exercises in the book for about a month, and they are good for me. I feel the difference. And - this program is fun to use, because the exercies vary so much. Time?! All you need is 20-30 min a day. No exuses, you're not that busy. You train 4-5 days a week, 30 min a day, at the most. Rest is as important as training.  This program can be used at home, in the hotelroom, in your own yard, at work.. you name it. You train 4-5 days a week, 30 Try this out! You can do it anywhere, anytime and it doesn' cost you a cent. Even the book itself is cheap. Thank you Lauren!    Yours sincerely  Trond Sorlie
0792838912|3.0|...the man's or the woman's. Recent reviews have led me to suggest that it is the woman's (under-represented) perspective that gives films such as this, the potential edge concerning understanding the process of submission and sensual exploration. On this occasion though, it is the man that introduces the woman to (in essence) harmless role-playing to the point of rejection. In otherwords, she likes some of it but not others. If you are a fan of Kim Bassinger then you will like this movie (though I think, on many levels, she is much better in LA Confidential). E-LOVE
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Everyone has their opinions.  That is a simple fact.  But here's mine: I loved the end of the show. LOST has always been one of my favorite shows due to the strong characters, creative story lines, and the deep mythology.  I always found it enjoyable to think about solutions to the mysteries and what the show actually meant.  So, going into season 6, I was excited to see if any of my predictions came true.  Although not all of my questions were answered, I was deeply impressed with the CHARACTERS' stories within the show.  Some of these episodes were so beautifully written, it amazed me how characters on a TV show could make me feel so emotional.  Thus, I was extremely pleased with \\"The End\\", as it resolved the characters' stories.  No matter what way you look at it, the show was about these characters and their adventures.  Not all of the mysteries were answered, but I think that is what the point of the ending was: not everything is going to be given out to you in life.  Sometimes you have to think about what certain things mean and come to your own conclusions.  I'm not going to lie, was I somewhat dissappointed that not all of the mysteries were answered? I was.  Did the season pan out like I had anticipated?  No.  However, I still respect the jobs that the writers did, and I especially commend the \\"final reveal\\" of the show.  To me, it was not a cop out; instead, I felt that it really touched upon what LOST was all about: the characters.  Overall, I highly reccomend the Sixth Season, as it is a fitting end to a truly great series.

B002NPUCF8|5.0|These guys have been around for awhile and have always been a great act. If you are easily offended or don't have a sense of humor, then don't buy this album. But if you like talented musicians who can actually play and write their own stuff who like to have fun, then please buy this album. They have a classic 80's metal sound with a Spinal Tap, yet funnier and cruder, feel.

0061186473|5.0|I listened to these stories and enjoyed them so much I bought the paperback.<br /><br />Great stories!!
0596805888|4.0|I feel obliged to review this book from the perspective of a certified geek, and so I compare it to other books in O'Reilly's catalog. Certainly O'Reilly has a series of books they label \\"Cookbooks\\", but this is not one of them. Those Cookbooks are all about specific \\"recipes\\" for solving programming problems or using software features. This book has recipes, for sure, but it's not all about the recipes. (In fact, the recipes are like... icing on the cake?) O'Reilly also publishes books that contain collections of \\"hacks,\\" which provide unorthodox or unusual ways of getting technology to do what you want it to do. And there are certainly some culinary hacks in this book (making ice cream with liquid nitrogen, \\"overclocking\\" your oven to cook things at superhigh temps), but that's not the only focus here. They also publish a series called \\"Head First\\", where the books are organized as a casual and fun way of \\"leaping into\\" the usage of a particular software platform, and in a way this is a \\"Head First Cooking\\" book, but it's much deeper than an introduction. If you're a true geek: think \\"culinary design patterns.\\" Think \\"cooking API reference.\\" Think \\"algorithms of food preparation in a nutshell.\\" Think a survey of the whys and wherefores behind the cooking process. Why does baking have to happen at certain temperatures for certain periods of time in order for certain things to happen? What are the underlying chemical reactions and processes that happen in the oven, in the frying pan, or even in a dishwasher! It's truly a learning experience for all: both the experienced chef who wants to think more like a hacker in the kitchen, and the geek who just wants to learn the art and science of cooking from a \\"hackerly\\" vantage point.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I promised myself that I'd never get hooked on another television show again after Twin Peaks was cancelled years ago.  I kept that promise for a long time.  But when I saw the first season of Supernatural, I was hooked again- only more so-  this time by a higher quality and more interesting show.  With the original characters, writing, storyline, dialogue - not to mention the great acting, every season got better setting even higher standards and higher expectations than the last.  Season 5 was no exception and included the best season finale yet. The entire series goes way beyond any horror show ever made.  It has immense depth in all its aspects. Although in season 5, there was definitely less humor- but what can you expect after Armageddon starts. Although, I did miss some of the humorous bantering between the characters that was more prevalent in past seasons. This season also had some awesome episodes to lighting up the mood when needed.  I have never purchased the DVDs to a series until now- and am looking forward to adding season 5 to the last four.  My great concern is that season 6 will be the last- what can be topped by what season 6 has in store for all of us fans.
B000ICZD5M|1.0|The story is very childish, and not much imagination I saw in the story setting.   All concepts appear are pretty old, not mention the plot is ridiculous.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|We are enjoying watching all of the Supernatural seasons as we did not see them while they were on TV.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|But filled with very unsubtle statements about America plotting decades in advance to insert a CIA-controlled British PM in place for the Iraq-Afghanistan wars (because we saw that one coming, of course).  Well, take it for what it is.  Anti-American propaganda directed by a man who has been a fugitive from American justice for over 30 years.  Disappointing to see Liam Neeson involved in this; we love his Long Way motorcycles movies.    But you notice that I can be honest about the quality of the movie -- I'm able to keep my head screwed on straight even when I disagree with someone.  Let hope others will display the same courtesy when reviewing conservative movies, books, etc.
B0036EH3X4|1.0|Season Six - Well to me the final season was a complete dud.  It felt as though the writers happily went on their way never planning an end to the show.  Then one day in the early stages of writing for Season 6 someone said, \\"This is it, the show is dead this year\\".  All writers scrambled with silly ideas to end the show.
B001EBJ776|4.0|It was close the book, and helped me understand what I read a little better... There were some differences- like the monster didn't kill Henry- and Victor never made the bride (come to life that is)... he threw her in a lake... but hey- you have to adapt it. So I give it 4 stars! :)
B0027BOL4G|5.0|i really enjoyed this documentary... my guy even liked it (and he hates me making him watch animal rights/ food industry movies) so if he liked it then it must be good. i feel that it was very educational in some areas but lacked slightly in others. but i do feel that this would be a great \\"beginners\\" video for people to watch if theyre just getting into finding out the truth....
B003NX76BM|5.0|Kept me coming back to read just a little bit more to find out what happened next.  Even had me awake in the middle of the night to read for \\"just a little while\\"...then it was another interesting book about a real life possible situation.
044024367X|3.0|I have no strong feelings about this book. It did drag a bit compared to the other Reacher books because there was so much walking/driving/watching and not a lot going on. It's kind of an issue because the author keeps pointing out that Reacher is neither a   fast driver nor a fast runner.
B00005K3OT|3.0|I love little old French villages, Johnny Depp and chocolate....so I was willing to put up with a certain amount of nonsense to enjoy this film.  As they say, \\"take the good and leave the rest.\\"    The \\"good\\" -- the lovely scenery and the cast.  Juliette Binoche is a charming actress who has made magic in other films; here...not so much.  Maybe it was the way the character was written but I found myself almost disliking her by the end of the film.  Judi Dench is always wonderful and here she does the best she can with a hopeless character.  Alfred Molina brings a one-dimensional character to life and deserves high marks for his performance. The child actress who plays Binoche's daughter is beautiful and successfully avoids being overly cute.  Lena Olin is ok as the abused wife who brightens up when helped by Binoche.  Johnny Depp has a small part, which is a shame since he steals every scene in which he appears.  He underplays his part beautifully which adds to his immense charm.  I liked his faint Irish accent, too.  It was lovely to see the beautiful Leslie Caron in a very small role.    From reading other reviews I get the idea that the novel from which the book is taken is presented more as a fairy tale than a realistic story.  I can see how that would work very well.  If the director had stuck to that idea the story would have gone down better. (no pun intended).  The opening scene with the two women blowing in on a \\"sly wind from the North\\" dressed in red woolen capes is very charming.      The problem is that the film is presented as real life, and that's where it begins to offend.  Instead of archetypes, we get stereotypes....the repressed, religious people of the town are all really nasty and hateful, whereas the free thinkers are the generous spirited ones with hearts of gold.  And chocolate heals all.  Several other reviewers have written some excellent critiques of this presentation and I recommend them.      The treatment of the Judi Dench character isanother huge mistake.  She is diabetic but chooses to celebrate her birthday by indulging in sweets, which results in her death.  I guess we're supposed to think this is really \\"gutsy\\" and \\"charming\\" but it didn't sit well with me.  I could pick at other details which illustrate the mistaken \\"morality\\" of this sorry story, but I'll let anyone interested read some of the one and two star reviews.     Still, it's France and there is an attempt in the end to resolve the town differences.  If you have to see a sappy story, it's good to have lovely scenery and then get to watch Johnny Depp for a few minutes.
0307474712|3.0|** spoiler alert ** This books follows the lives of Dexter and Emma on/around July 15th of each year, beginning with their graduation day. They have their whole lives ahead of them.     I didn't mind the changes in perspective, but I didn't like the big year-long gaps in the story. Since so much happens in a year, and the author jumps over the whole year, I have to work backwards at each chapter to figure out what was skipped. There is a lot missing.     It's interesting, but it's a love story that goes on for way too long without any real connection or happiness between Dexter and Emily. Their relationship is many times more awkward than anything else. I didn't feel any \\"spark\\" between them until the last few pages of the book.     Ugh, I almost threw the book out after Emma's random death. This is a just \\"okay\\" book with a horrible ending.

0439023483|5.0|Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark are living out their worst nightmares.  In post-apocalyptic North America The Capitol forces each of the 12 districts remaining to send 2 teenagers, 1 boy and 1 girl, every year to the Capitol to take part in a fight to the death, last man standing is the winner \\"game\\".      The brilliance of this book lies in the progression of Peeta and Katniss's relationship with each other and what they are or are not willing to do in the name of survival.  Don't expect another \\"Brave New World\\" clone - you won't find it here.    Ms. Collins uses the backdrop of tyranny and oppression to tell one girl's story.  That Katniss has an inherent rebellious streak is evident from nearly the first page - but it's rebellion to keep her family from starving, and eventually to try to ensure her own survival in the Games.    The author takes us through quite a journey of surprises, unrequited love and the cunning of a young girl determined to go back to her family.    This is an excellent and unexpectedly well-written offering.  This is a book clearly written with teens in mind, but it's just as appealing for adults.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|First time I bought this movie was when my 1st grandson was about 4 years old and it came out on VHS at the time.  My grandson did not move the entire time the movie was on.  He loved the movie and usually a 3 to 4 year old's attention span isn't very long.  Now that I have 3 year old grand twins I had to get this movie again.  However, I bought the DVD version.  Of course, the twins love it.  They talk about Buz and Woody all the time.  You will never see toys the same way again!
B003S897U0|3.0|Has to be my favortie band. The Black Crowes music had (de)evolved. Trouble is, it evolved into the same sounding Deadesque honkey tonk stuff created by so many other artists. Ala - Derick Trucks, Government Mule, Allmans, 'jam band stuff' and the like. They had so much more sound than any of these bands ever had. I have to admit that Before the Frost has grown on me. Yet After the Freeze is drab, like War Paint. Music for musicians I call it. I even loved their experimentation (Lions). But what do I know? I like By your Side the most, which is the (including the Crowes) least liked ablum. Virtue and Vice baby. So this is how it ends? In a wimper but it still sounds ok because I am a Crowes fan....
0061339202|5.0|It's interesting that the author (Csikzentmihalyi) forewarns the reader that he or she will need full concentration on the material in Flow to grasp it completely. I found this to be entirely true. At times, I would start drifting off, since certain sections are understandably less interesting than others, but afterward, I would find that I needed to reread that part to comprehend the information in a subsequent portion of the chapter. This book is a great read, and I actively seek to find/gain optimal experiences in my day-to-day life.

B002CAWNEM|1.0|This pathetic film is'nt even a watered down version of \\"Fatal Attraction,\\" but instead a stinking stew pot of \\"The Hand the Rocks the Cradle,\\" \\"Disclosure,\\" \\"Waiting to Exhale,\\" and \\"Play Misty for Me,\\" all superior films to this tripe. \\"Obsessed\\" seems to exist for two simple reasons: to portray a black man as the Victim of a white woman, and to give Beyonce Knowles a chance to \\"Kick some ass.\\" It fails on both accounts. Idris Elba looks like a younger Magic Johnson (ironically one of the Producers of this mess) but he acts like an Idiot: instead of taking care of the Stalker/Nut Job with a quick visit to Human Resources, he allows Ms. Lauter's Lisa to keep harassing him until it's too late. Ms. Lauter is a completely unconvincing Psycho. She seems more concerned with good camera angles and her skimpy wardrobe. But she looks like Meryl Streep compared to Beyonce Knowles. Ms. Knowles struggles to bring any sympathy to her character and while she looks great and treats us to some new songs (!) , she simply can't act. Period. And when she finally gets to \\"Kick some Ass,\\" it is so poorly choreographed and ridiculous, it is too little too late. Add in every movie cliche: the Cops finger the wrong person, the Hero looks guilty, blah blah blah. I hope the Actors at least got paid well for this.
B003PWPGT0|3.0|They played well, but the songs are not memorable...at all<br /><br />\\"I should have known it\\" is the best rocking track<br /><br />Followed up by \\"Something Good Coming\\" for the best laid back song<br />nice feeling to this one.<br /><br />a lot of delay/echo effects on almost every song, while it gives it expanse<br />I thought it was over used on this album.
0307454541|5.0|This was an amazing crime/thriller. An intricately plotted mystery  that left me anxious for more. I was so engrossed in this book that many times I stayed up later than I had originally planned just reading and reading. This book had so many twists and turns. I will read the other two books in the series.  The author put so much into this book: knowledge and research. The author was very well read, himself.<br /><br />The translator should also be applauded. It is a laborious task to translate from one language to another. There are so many different inflections and other nuances that are unique to each language.<br /><br />I am the author of [[ASIN:1432705342 Summer Born: A Life With Cerebellar Ataxia]] and [[ASIN:1432702033 Dreams in August: Life, Love, and Cerebellar Ataxia]].

B003JTHESA|1.0|Talk about \\"Groundhog Day\\". I keep hearing the same three songs over and over again. And this is not just on this album. I'm talking about the last three albums. They all use the same recipe with different lyrics. Now that's innovative. Somebody please either revive me or put Iron Maiden to sleep. I have lost all confidence in their song writing ability(musically,that is). I will not buy another IM album. they are the ones who performed the actual \\"Dance of Death\\" a couple of albums ago. There really and truly is nothing new or exciting or original with this album. I honestly tried numerous times to listen to and like this dud but i just can't take it.  I think it is time once again for Bruce and Adrian to part ways with Harris and his overly long and dragged out songs that all sound THE SAME!  Here is a new album title for you Iron Maiden for your next endeavor. Call it \\"Just Let it End\\".

0140277447|4.0|This is a Horrific story that is a real page turner. Chang describes, in great detail, the horrors which the Chinese endured at the hands of the Japanese. She brings to light this almost forgotten story of barbarianism. It is summed up niceley and flows well from the begining of the invaion on. Chang chronicals the afemath, what the world saw, and the lasting memories of this holocast without dragging the story out with minute details (which is often seen in many comparable stories)

B000T00PE2|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard! I realize that any1 reading this would probably think that I am crazy but this is truly a phenomenal album. I bought this album because Amazon had it for $5. This album is easily worth $20. It is ambient dance and trance all rolled into one in my opinion. I can listen from 1 song 2 another without skipping any of them. Buy this album and then check out their music videos on the web.
0439023483|5.0|Easily a quick read, this wonderfully inventive novel takes you along Katniss's journey into and through the hunger games. And, although a dumb name for the heroic main character, you will find yourself not being able to take a break from her near death journey through the games. With a clear cut (albeit surprise) ending you will find that you can stop at just this first novel but will probably not want to. ;)
B003QCCS36|5.0|Ok so I admit it, I'm a really big sucker for the pedal and lap-steal guitar.  When Ryan Adams came out with Cold Roses & Jacksonville City Nights I fell in love with the sound and it's stuck.  Ray's new album is def a departure from his previous 3 albums and I must say that I think this is his best work hand's down.  Here are some notes on some of the tunes, (not all):    The album starts of kind of strange with Repo Man, my least favorite track on the entire album.  I think Ray made a mistake here, it should of come last or been left off.  It does not fit with the other tunes on the album but it is not enough to knock this out of the \\"5 Star\\" category    NYC's Killing Me:  I'll admit again I don't love the song.  The music is great but the lyrics I find a little pretentious.  I'm sure many will love it anyhow.    God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise:  This is where the album starts to take off and bring you to another place.  It's the type of song that give's you goosebumps and get's better with every listen but it doesn't take many to realize that this is one of the best songs Ray has ever written.  It would of fit nicely on JCN if you're a fan of Ryan Adams.  The pedal-steal give the song a dreamy affect and Ray's voice is a transcendant masterpiece.  Hints of Bob Seger and Ryan Adams in this one...call me crazy.  And it only get's better...    Beg Steal or Barrow:  My favorite song on the album and quite possibly the best song I've heard in years.  I loved it at first listen.  Youth anthem that will give you goosebumps again.  I hear Ryan Adams, Joni Mitchell, CSN in there among others...    Old Befor Your Time:  Hints of Dan Folgelberg here.....one of the album's best    For The Summer:  Again this song ranks up with some of the best tune's Ray's ever made.  He opened a live show in Boston with this song in August that I attended.  It was my first time seeing him.  It instantly grabbed my attention and Ray's precense in this song was something special....soundsof Neil Young in the guitar playing and Ray's voice again is a marvel in this one...beautiful song.    Ray Lamontagne if you read these, how about one more album with the Pariah Dogs?  This is my favorite style of music and it definately suits your skills......this album has instantly gone into my top 10 for the past decade.  Pick it up now and feel it!
0307271862|5.0|I don't usually like mysteries, but this one was different.  I found the book well constructed and interesting, never dull, and pleasant to pick up at any time or in any section of the book.  The evil character who was the instigator seemed a little contrived, but there could be someone real like him.  Over all I LOVED the book and am glad to recommend it.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|This has been one of the most anticipated Kylie Minogue releases in her career. Her last album, \\"X\\", was met by mostly mixed reviews and troubles (leaked songs, singles that didn't do as well as they could have). But with 2009's succesful North American tour (I went to the Chicago show), Kylie Fever has been building once again. When \\"Aphrodite\\" was finally released, I, and millions of fans around the world were not disappointed. I feel that this is one of Kylie's best albums ever. It was Number 19 on the US Billboard Charts so I know that thousands of Americans were feeling this album too.<br /><br />I pretty much love all the tracks on the album but here's my thoughts on each song:<br /><br />1. All the Lovers - 5/5 The first single off of the album. To me, the second chorus is the best part. The music video got people talking too (if you haven't seen it yet, you should)<br /><br />2. Get Outta My Way - 5/5 This is the second single-it's being released officially in September 2010. When I first listened to the song, it gave me goosebumps. It's definitely a get up and dance song.<br /><br />3. Put your hands up - 5/5 This will most likely be a single in the future. When I first listened to a 30 second clip of this song, I wasn't too sure that I would like it but when I heard the full song, I fell in love with it. I really like the instrumental part in the middle of the song.<br /><br />4. Closer 3/5 It's my least favorite track on the cd. It's the only song that I find myself skipping. I'm not sure why I don't like it but I just don't<br /><br />5. Everything is Beautiful - 4/5 The slowest song on the album. The chorus is lovely \\"And if I lie with you long enough, I can see the things I'm dreaming of.<br /><br />6. Aphrodite - 5/5 The title track and my absolute favorite song on the album. The beginning of the song is a sly wink to the \\"Heartbeat Rock\\" intro that Kylie used in her North American tour. I can play this song over and over and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. I love it because it's upbeat, easy to dance to, and the chorus is one of the best on the album. Plus I like this lyric \\"It's the truth, it's a fact, I was gone and now I'm back\\"<br /><br />7. Illusion - 5/5 Another one of my favorites. It's a slower but it's still got a great beat. I could see this doing well as a single.<br /><br />8. Better than Today - 5/5 This is the song that Kylie premiered on the North American tour. Kylie promised it would be on the album and here it is. Some fans say that the vibe of the song doesn't match the rest of the album but I disagree. It's such a cool song.<br /><br />9. Too much - 5/5 It's another song that I wasn't sure that I would like when I heard the small clip of but I really like this song. The bridge (\\"I can't say, I can't say what it is. If I say what I feel it's too much\\") is my favorite part of the song.<br /><br />10. Cupid Boy - 4/5 It's a cool dance song. I could see this one getting the crowd going at a concert<br /><br />11. Looking for an angel - 4/5 It's a good song. I like it but it's not one of my top favorites.<br /><br />12. Can't Beat the Feeling - 5/5 A great song to close the album with. It's upbeat and cheery. Classic Kylie.<br /><br />The Special Edition of Aphrodite comes with a DVD. That features the White Diamond section of Kylie North American tour. The songs are:<br />-White Diamond Theme -Which features Kylie quoting classic actress quotes (\\"Toto, I have a feeling we're not not in Kansas anymore\\", \\"Alright Mr, DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up, \\"No more wire hangers ever!\\" etc.)<br /><br />-White Diamond - a beautiful ballad version that was feautured in the White Diamond documentry and her Showgirl Homecoming tour<br /><br />-Confide in me - this version is like the one performed in her 2005 Showgirl tour but updated slightly<br /><br />-I believe in you - it's the same ballad version as featured in X tour<br /><br />The DVD also features a making of her All the Lovers video (don't knowwhy the video itself is not included), Behind the scenes for the Aphrodite photo shoot, and a photo gallery.<br /><br />_______________________<br /><br />This is one of Kylie's best albums ever and it's a must for any fan of Kylie's fans. But I think that anyone who enjoys pop and dance music should look into getting \\"Aphrodite\\".is one of Kylie's best albums ever and it's a must for any fan of Kylie's fans.

0670021652|3.0|In the foreword, the author said she had destroyed one manuscript and started over. This one feels a bit sketchy and unfocused. There are some great stories here, but mostly, she retreats into theory instead of focusing on the reality of a what it means to build a real, long-term relationship. I wonder if she felt uncomfortable writing about her relationship once she was planning to marry? That might explain why it felt too cerebral and less heartfelt.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|I've heard about La Roux for awhile but I hadn't listened to her music. It wasn't until I heard \\"Bulletproof on the radio that I realized how great her songs are. I went and immediately bought the album and I wasn't disappointed by it. Her voice is really unique. Not too many people can pull off singing in high voice as well as she does. The high singing voice may turn some people off but I enjoy it.<br /><br />The cd is full of songs with great beats and great lyrics. The lyrics are not mindless words like \\"Oh boy I need your love\\" or silly things like that. You can tell that the lyrics are deeper and just by reading the lyrics in the book, there are almost like poetry.<br /><br />My favorite tracks: In for the kill, Tigerlily, Quicksand, Bulletproof, Colourles colour(my absolute favorite one), Fascination, and Growing Pains.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys music with a dance beat.
B002ZG999U|5.0|When I heard about Sylvester Stallone a guy who has directed a lot of his own movies he knows his audience that he was directing the Expendables writing & directing starring as Barney Ross also starring  Dolph Lundgren Gunner Jenson,a guy who directs a lot of his own stuff & another guy who knows his audience then Jason Statham as Lee Christmas then Jet Li as Yin Yang   Mickey Roourke Tool Box, Rnady Coulture as Toll Road     Stone Cold Steve Austin as Paine he worked well with Gary Daniels  Eric Roberts who plays the main villain James Monroe David Zayas as General Garza Giselle Itié as Sandra      Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger came in for cameos for obvious reasonsI waitedalmost 2 years for this movie & was it worth it? You d**n right it was! It started off slow & got better & better & became f*ç***g awesome. It has some flaws I would've liked more Dolph Lundgren a longer fight between him & Jet Li but I liked Dolph's character of Gunner cause it was kind of close to how crazy his Andrew Scott character was in the original Universal Soldier. Which that style was badly needed in Universal Soldier Regeneration I will always hate USR I watched USR again nothings changed it's still terrible. Since this movie is doing fairly well at the box office maybe LGF can release specialeditions of Punisher 89 & Army Of One. This movie has action out the @** last 20 or 30 minutes was great. The story is simple straight forward & effective & it doesn't get bogged down by politics like Machete. These guys are Mercs who will do any kind of work from killing Somali pirates to stopping a C I A sell out. Basically Barney Ross & his team have to go to some Centeral or South American country to go after James Monroe & to stop the arms trade. Gunner Jenson has a drug problem & he's out of conrol he's following Barney around he doesn't want to be replaced. Ross & Lee check out the island for themselves this is where we meet there contact Sandra. I enjoy the dialoge between Stallone & Statham Lee:\\"I'm, Buddha & he's Pest.\\" I love the scene where Stallone guns those soldiers down I love when Statham yells \\"Are you crazy you could've klilled me!\\" Stallone \\"You're welcome!\\" The dock scene was great. I love Mickey Roorke's monolouge which helps Barney Ross go back & save the girl. I like these character I want them to live unlike Predators or Machete.    The Stallone, Arnold, Willis scene was quick but great I really hope Arnold Schwarzenegger has a bigger role if there's a sequel but that 1 minute he had was better than his entire screen time in Terminator 3. I sure as h3** would see a sequel. Maye you can incorporate Jean Claude Van Damme maybe he'll say \\"Yes I'll do it this time Sly!\\" Instead of trying to impress the high brow crowd. Chuck Norris would be cool since I've never seen him on the big screen. You know maybe Jeff Speakman maybe Mark Dacascos. Randy Coulter I forgot to mention he did a good job a lot better than Andrei Arvlosky in Universal Soldier Regeneration just had to put that in there to upset the Marks of USR. Loved that scene with  Terry Crews & that shotgun it needs no explanation. Mickey Roourke had a really good monologue. Stallone & Statham made a great team. I love this movie cause these guys don't try hard to be bad @** there's likeability you want to root for these guys & they don't have to use a 30 year chain smoker voice. Movie earns it's R raiting. I like where Yin Yang wants more money for his family cause the character is a dreamer. You get this really good chase scene with Ross & Gunner & like I said I like the fight between Gunner & Yin Yang Gunner:\\" What are you wearing a size 3! Bring it happy feet!\\" The finish is awesome it made the movie it blew me away in the theater lot's of explosions Hale Caesar AA 12 shot gun rocks it's just an awesome finish. This movie set out to be an 80's throwback & it is my favorite movie of the year. It has CGI but it is good CG there's very little it's more old school effects. It's better CGI then Predators & Machete & they get the praise. I really enjoyed the documentaries on the Blu Ray you learn that Stallone & these guys busted there a s s  es Stallone nearly killed himself he got hurt & didn't stop production. See I don't respect Seagal anymore cause he's out of shape & he just throws punches & calls it a day lets a stunt double do the rest. So it was simple straight forward entertaining movie.I could talk forever about this movie but I recommend it you should see this movie & give it your full attention. The critics bashed this movie & when I saw it I was like WTF critics what did you expect this wipes it's @zz with your pretty boy Matt Damon & other so called actiom movies I wasn't expecting a greek tragedy  or an art film didn't need it didn't want it. Just straight forward action. Thank You Stallone!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I read The Hunger Games for a project at school after my teacher strongly recommended it. As I read it I found it easy to read and pretty action filled. The Hunger games is a good story, but I found some parts too slow and dry. I also didn't like the characters even though I wanted too. I think that the whole hunger games idea is brilliant but I didn't like the way it was written. I started this book wanting to love it but I ended up only liking it.
7885142434|5.0|IP MAN was my favorite movie of 2009, so I was excited to watch IP MAN 2. I was not disappointed. Can't say any more. Get this DVD and watch it! The DVD itself was great. Note that this DVD comes in a slim glossy slipcase, not a regular DVD amray case. That's fine with me. Takes up less space. I'm more interested in the DVD itself than the packing. Nothing is more frustrating to me than buying a DVD, and getting quality I could have gotten downloading. Don't worry about that here. Picture quality is great. This is a dual-layer DVD, so there's less compression = better picture quality. Subtitles were perfect. I speak Cantonese, so some things they have to translate slightly different than the Chinese meaning, but the translation was as accurate as it could have possibly been. My wife who doesn't speak Chinese loved it as well. There are also a few special features on the DVD that we enjoyed.

B002RWKSII|1.0|Who comes up with these concepts? Can't Brian Wilson stick to what he does best? Why must we be subjected to yet ANOTHER sad take on the Great American Songbook? It's getting close to the point where all of these albums should be listed in a category called \\"The Great American Songbook Goes Down in Flames.\\"<br /><br />If ANYONE thinks that Brian Wilson's version of \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" has any merit, I suggest they listen to the versions by Fred Astaire, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday - just to mention a few classic renditions.
032147404X|4.0|Pros: Good read (very entertaining); you will take better pictures; easy to understand (not too technical)<br />Cons: I wish it had exif data for all the pictures instead of just the last 10 or so; geared toward Canon/Nikon users but still works for all DSLRs.
B003XU7VM4|1.0|I enjoy ABC's Castle on TV.  I have liked Nathan Fillion ever since I first encountered him in the SF series \\"Firefly\\", then the movie, \\"Serenity\\".  I really enjoy his family in the series.  I like the character of Kate Beckett.  This book, though is horrible.  When other reviewers say that they like it, I am totally puzzled.  I am at page 102, and wondering if I can go on.  It is so poorly written, in such a poor style it is painful to read.  It is so bad, that I have to wonder if it was written as a joke of how the crime writer Castle cannot really write at all.<br /><br />I have read thousands of books in my life.  Many, many mysteries and police dramas included.  Some were very good, and some not so good.  Ed McBain's series of the 87th precinct are an excellent example of a good cop novels, and I recommend them to everyone.  This book though, is the biggest stinker that I can remember in quite a while.  It is now selling for $8, down from the issue price, which should also tell prospective readers something.  IMO, $8 is still way too much.  Don't waste your money.  Buy something good.
0061914177|1.0|Whoever said this book and author rocked should be shot ! Absolutely the worst book I've read in years! The author has no heart and his message is about his own selfish greed and how He used it to become wealthy.  He is desperately seeking accolades and more money from his used car salesmanship methods. Not interested in his \\"beg,borrow,and steal\\" method since it is void of all integrity.
030726999X|5.0|I read the first two books and so naturally had to read this last one to finish the trilogy. I could not put it down. It is interesting and detailed. Lisbeth Salander is further developed as a character and despite her flaws, I think that I like her even more. The last book starts right where the second one left off and goes through her time in the hospital up until her trial. There is a lot of information on the Sapo that is revealed and more evil characters are introduced. It was a great read that kept me entertained.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|In the year 2174, Earthlings have escaped the planet with everything they carry in a large spaceship heading to planet Tanis where everything must be sent such as animals, plants, food and people of course to survive. Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) has been awaken from his rest as well as Lt. Payton (Dennis Quad), Gallo (Cam Gigandet), Nadia (Antej Trace) and Manh (Gung Le) with others too. As they look around the ship, they are heading to a better new place that is until mutant alien stowaways are aboard the ship killing some people and turning the trip into a nightmare.<br /><br />Unfairly dismissed as another Alien wannabe by some critics and bombed at the box-office, i thought this was a terrific and scary Sci-fi horror shocker. It does give off a bit of Alien with more being like Event Horizon and The Thing with The Black Hole thrown into it, the film is well acted and shot. The film is relentlessly gory such as head explosions to cannibalism from the aliens, it is a claustrophobic and atmospheric feature that excites and gives some quality fresh ideas.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is just flawless on the picture and sound scale since it is a brand new movie. The extras are cool like commentary, deleted and alternate scenes, featurette, trailer, flight team training video and still galleries.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"The Thing (1982)\\", \\"Galaxy of Terror\\", \\"Forbidden World\\", \\"Alien Saga\\", \\"Predator 1, 2 and Predators\\", \\"AVP 1 & 2\\", \\"Event Horizon\\", \\"The Black Hole\\", \\"Avatar\\", \\"Heavy Metal\\", \\"Lifeforce\\", \\"The Deadly Spawn (a.k.a.

B0025KW29U|5.0|I had heard of this from a friend but was hesitant in buying it because I knew so little of it. I had some extra cash this payday and picked it up on bluray. I watched it Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It just had me laughing every time I watched it and the extras on the DVD are great to watch. Definately watch it with the commentary after you have already watched it once.<br />PLOT: As we first meet Billy (Dr Horrible), we actually like him. As the story progresses, situations (relationships) seem to turn for the worst and he slowly begins to be the Dr Horrible he was meant to be and becomes the enemy we can learn to dispise yet still root for.<br />The contraversy over if the product is made in DVD-R or pressed DVD is a redundant issue. Take care of your DVD's and don't buy a cheap DVD player. Most DVD players will play either version so it is a non-issue which format it is made in. If a person buys the cheapest DVD player they can find and it won't play DVD-R, you got what you paid for.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|If you are a true Author of Fiction, you MUST see this movie :)<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you recognize two very familiar characters - from recent Sonic commercials - playing IRS agents in this movie....<br /><br />And how it ends...? Well, we haven't even touched on that yet...
0375507256|5.0|Most reviews of \\"[[ASIN:0375507256 Cloud Atlas: A Novel]]\\" start with David Mitchell's dazzling narrative surprises, his \\"Russian-doll\\"-like use of nested or linked  stories that form a larger, over-arching, meta-narrative blah blah...Sorry, I don't mean to get snarky and I'm really making fun of myself, since I say things like that all the time in all sincerity. But I think that this line of reflection misses Mitchell's essential greatness which, imho, greatly transcends, though is certainly served by, his technical brilliance, namely, his profound engagement with that oldest of human stories: the struggle to free ourselves from the cruel, oppressive - and usually literal - enslavement to which we subject  our fellows and ourselves.  He also takes this up in his current bestseller, \\"[[ASIN:1400065453 The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet: A Novel]]\\" in a completely different form (I'll review that book seperately).    In \\"[[ASIN:0375507256 Cloud Atlas: A Novel]],\\" he plays variations on this theme, first, in its mercantile and violently racist forms in the nineteenth century colonial South Pacific, and then through the corporate greed of the recent past and present, a hellish future bio-tech-enabled slave society,  an finally, and even further post-apocalyptic future where small communities try to protect the fragile remnants of human culture from stronger predatory tribes.    What amazes me is that I finished reading \\"Cloud Atlas\\" feeling stirred, hopeful  and invigorated; not at all what the description of the content in the last paragraph might lead you to expect. But that's Mitchell's genius. His vision is so deep, so inclusive and his love of language and people so palpable that in his work, hope trumps despair, no matter how difficult the truth he tells may be.    I don't believe that his work is all that \\"difficult\\" or \\"not for everyone\\"  any more or less than any other distinct piece of art, which is always subject to personal taste. But good storytelling is simply that. And if you hang in beyond the first two sections and begin to trust that Mitchell is not just messing with you (he isn't!) the powerful current of his storytelling will carry you away.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I can honestly say I have never, ever been scared by a movie in my entire life.  Everything I've seen was either gory, predictable, or both, including Blair Witch.    I hadn't heard or seen anything about this movie before watching it, my boyfriend and I just decided to rent it on a whim one night because there was nothing left in Redbox that we hadn't seen, so I entered into it completely unbiased, except for my previously formed general disdain for the horror genre as a whole.  That being said, and I feel a little embarrassed for admitting I'm this gullible, I wasn't convinced it was fake until the final two seconds of the movie.      The main reason for this is that the acting was superb, flawless.  Katie and Micah seemed like a completely average, albeit slightly dysfunctional, couple.  Their interactions were so natural that they had me believing wholeheartedly that these were recordings of the goings-on between a real life couple.  This set the stage for my believing the rest of the events in the film were valid and thus SCARED THE EVER-LIVING BEJESUS OUT OF ME.    This film impacted me like no other and nearly made me a complete believer in the paranormal.  My heart was beating out of my chest, my eyes never blinked, and I'm fairly certain my kung fu grip cut off all circulation to my boyfriend's lower arm. Once I saw the last few seconds in which Hollywood had clearly intervened and sprinkled a little special effects dust on the final scene I realized with some disappointment but much more relief that it was all, indeed, just a movie.      After my sheepishness wore off, it was replaced by sheer excitement.  FINALLY!  A horror movie that wasn't a pile of disembodied limbs and trite garbage!  I had finally been scared!  I had been longing for a psychological thriller that would actually scare me for so long that I was convinced it would never happen.  My fear may have been a direct result of mistaking the movie for an actual documentary *blush*, and I may notexperience the same rush were I to watch it again, but for the first time in 23 years I got a scare!      I'm not sure if this review will be of any practical use to anyone, but at the very least I would say this movie is worth watching at least once.  It may take a little imagination to prime you for the same kind of experience I had, but if you want to be scared it's worth a shot!
B000G73UEU|5.0|Grabbed the DVD first of this tribute concert just because I liked Rufus Wainwright but wow was I in for a surprise.  What a rare gem we have in Leonard Cohen and his incredible prose set to wonderful music.  Whomever did the arrangements make all the songs sound as if they were just written.  Only genius songs can posses this timelessness.  Leonard Cohen's already powerful lyrics are further elevated by all the incredible artists that turned out to interpret some of his great works.    The only flaw with this soundtrack is that it leaves out some of the songs in the DVD concert.  And likewise there are gems on the soundtrack that were not on the DVD.  Standouts are the showstopping \\"If It Be Your Will\\" by Antony, \\"Bird On A Wire\\", and \\"Ring The Bells\\".  But the entire concert is a joy to discover if you aren't familiar with Mr. Cohen.  Get the DVD first and use the sub titles to realize the full power of such magnificent lyrics (and music). it doesn't get any better than this!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Carole King and James Taylor have always been wonderful performers.  Unlike many of their contemporaries, King and Taylor have only improved with age.  They are comfortable with themselves, their music, and their fans and this delightful performance reflects that comfort.  It is truly a magical evening captured in contemporary media.  It soothes the soul.
B0000640VO|5.0|Quirky, French language film filmed in and around Paris with an original and unassuming plot that is suprisingly good. Using the IMDB rating scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 7.6.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|This is one of the few movies my whole family enjoys. I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it. This is probably what inspired the Twilight series. It's just a great movie that you must own if you like vampire movies.

6301971272|5.0|This is Clint's best movie EVER! Not my favorite western, but still pretty awesome. If you're a western fan and you haven't seen this masterpiece, BUY IT NOW!!!
B003C1QIO6|3.0|I heard this here and there, and thought I'd buy the album. It's pretty okay, and I enjoyed it for a bit and then realized it is actually completely lacking depth. Jack Johnson does not seem to have the capacity for any sort of angst - he has one mood, like some sort of happy go lucky robot. Probably good for some settings, I don't know - playing at a pool party where the guests are all 21 year olds in some nether region between hippies and preps.  But in some ways, it's sort of good. Sometimes I like it a lot, other times I cringe at the thought. The instrumentation and production is well done. I don't really understand.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|This is a pretty good western movie. Not one I watch all that often, but fun to watch once in a while. The acting is a bit cheesy, but I had to give it 5 stars because I love Clint Easteood's movies.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Could not wait to receive Rock Symphonies by David Garrett and it did not disappoint!  Again this CD proves that he is such a talent at melding classical music with rock.  November Rain will bring you to tears,it is so beautifully done by this master of music.  If you have not had a chance to see him live this CD will surely convince you to do so.

B003EYVXYQ|2.0|I have to say George's best movies were Night of the Living dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead.  Land of the dead was bad, but I felt Diary of the Dead was somewhat better.  The first 3 films had some intensity to them but his latest film is just plain stupid. I managed to pick up the blu ray dvd at a local retailer yesterday and viewed it last night. They put it on their shelves a couple of days earlier then its set release date.  It was a waste of 18.50 inclusive of tax, LOL!<br />I just couldnt get into the film for some reason, the acting was bad and the storyline is pretty lame.  He could have made the film by leaving all the action in PA where people are fighting to stay alive from the zombies, instead of adding all this bloody stupid clan fighting nonsense.  I would suggest that you rent this movie at Red Box or something before you consider purchasing it.  I made a mistake but hey thats life, right!?
B001R4SYPG|5.0|Many versions of Terry Riley's \\"In C\\" are now available, but this recording of 1968 began it all. The premiere was in 1964 in San Francisco with different instrumentation and number of players. The key problem for Riley in New York was that the recording would be an LP with two sides and about 45 minutes total time. The piece has no breaks and Riley envisioned it longer, over an hour. This CD edition eliminates the artifical break. The tone is more treble than the premiere and subsequent recordings, heavy on woodwinds and tinkling percussion. However, as Riley did not specify any instrumention and number of players, no length of perfomance, nor tempo, every version is valid; they just vary in mood and style.<br /><br />Historically, the musical world changed with this recording. This piece was conceived in experimental jazz and Eastern musical influences and was regarded as classical because the premiere was covered by the classical music critic of the San Francisco Chronicle. This album was released during the Cultural Revolution and marketed toward the youth, who were listening to Indian ragas and were more receptive to the work's time-expansive and meditative aspects. Steve Reich, who performed at the premiere on W&uuml;rlizer organ, would go on his own path of minimalism. Thus, with this recording, musicians, composers, and the listening audience expanded their sensitivity, took on a broader, consciousness-directed interest in music. It indeed was a dawn of a new age.
B003L5LEYW|5.0|\\"Distant Relatives\\" is a beautiful and inspirational hip hop album. Anyone who believe the hip hop genre celebrates nothing more than mysogny and degeneracy needs to listen to this album. Every track is a masterpiece. The album's songs touch on a multitude of themes such peace, unity, regeneration and self improvement. What elevates this album into a classic, though, is the exceptional collaborative chemistry between Nas and Damien Marley. In this album they've managed to fuse reggae and rap into one of the most unique and artful sounds I've ever heard. This album may rate as the best work Nas has ever produced and he is the author of what is widely considered among the three best hip hop albums of all time, \\"Illmatic\\". Coming from someone who considers Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\" as his all time favorite, \\"Distant Relatives\\" is one of the best albums I've heard in years.
0061120073|5.0|Saying this book is very good is an understatement. The author makes the characters seem so real and unpretentious.  Life for Francie doesn't always have a happy ending which is very relatable if you want a book that captures the essence of life.

0393061310|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this book,I don't know where to start. First, the author sees himself as a scientist and writes like he is providing an article to Vanity Fair. Ignoring science, disregarding significant works and stating opinion as fact he proceeds to batter us with trivia while ignoring facts. I have no argument with the inability of IQ tests to accurately define human intelligence as it relates to practical capability. That doesn't mean, as one of the other reviewers mentioned, that the Bell Curve is not a significant book. Argue the rationale not simply state an opinion and walk away. This book is so plagued with bad science and silly extrapolations from 11,000 years ago that it ignores many of the realities of history. I'll stop now but I could go on for paragraphs.
6304806418|2.0|A previous suggestion that the customer has a possible illegal copy is not likely to be correct.<br /><br />However, the releases to date of this movie exhibit a very poor low resolution grainy image. I can't imagine with the technology of the year which it was shot it being as bad as it is.<br />No, it wasn't created this way to portray the era, it's just bad.<br />Not only the vision, but the audio also suffers from extremely poor dynamics and sounds flat. Strangely the CD Soundtracks of the movie are fine?<br />A review on the Amazon UK site states that the releases in France and Australia are good. Sorry, the Australian release is the one I have reviewed here.<br />The release in France is not known to me, I looked on the French site for possible reviews but alas I cannot read.<br />I loved this movie mainly for the music, even with the poor quality and am hoping for the Bluray to become available which may be created from more skillful hands!<br /><br />Edit: Have just received and viewed the very recent Blu-ray release. This is fabulous in all respects and I don't understand how the DVD was ever released in such poor condition.<br />This new BR however was well worth the wait and will become one of my favourites. Seeing it now with such an improvement in quality has made the tremendous scope in the making of it much more apparent.<br />The latest sound mix in DTS HD Master is fantastic and the video reflects very much the feel of the time.

B003ICWTTM|2.0|I couldn't wait to buy this Bluray of the \\"Boss\\" but someone should call in the Trumpster (your fired!)on this one. The volume of Springsteens voice and the highend of the soundtrack is recorded so high that it must be listened to at a real low volume. I wish I could return it.
0545123283|4.0|I am not exactly sure how I feel about this book now that I am done with it. There are parts I liked, and parts I am not sure about. Parts reminded me of Twilight and their sickly love towards each other. With the characters feeling that the world will stop if they are broken apart. And, maybe I just think that is a little over dramatized and it bothers me. I don't think it is the best thing to sell to teenagers that they can't live without their true love even if they are a room apart. It is unhealthy to think that way, although I am sure tons of people have felt the way Sam and Grace did about each other in this book. But, it annoyed me. And, I found myself siding with Grace's parents instead of Grace as she started to annoy me.<br /><br />But, I did like the plot how Sam is finally finding himself at the same time Grace is slowly losing herself. I like the new character Cole and his relationship with Isabel, Sam and himself. I was happy to learn more about Sam's past and also Cole's past as well. There was more depth with Isabel that I like a lot too. She might be my favorite character. The point of view alternated between Cole, Grace, Sam and Isabel. And, I didn't have that hard of time trying to figure out which characters point of view I was reading from because they all have a very distinct personality.<br /><br />I do want to know what happens in the next book which I believe is being called Forever. It leaves you wanted to know more. What will happen to Grace, Sam and Cole. Will they finally get there happy ending?
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just had a baby and was out of shape and overweight! I did this workout for a month and lost 11 pounds. I didn't do it every day maybe on average 4 days a week and for 2 weeks I didn't use hand weights. After a month I just moved up to level 2 which is harder, but manageable now that I've been working out for a month. I can't wait to lose another 11 pounds this month. As long as you do this workout, you should lose weight. I tell everyone I see about this workout.
0547258305|3.0|Occasionally a child is born who develops two different colored eyes. These children, the Graced, are immediately given to the king as his property, as each Graced child will exhibit a different talent or special gift. Those whose gifts are useful to the king will serve him for the rest of their lives. Those whose talents the king finds useless will be sent back to their homes. In either case, their eyes and their gifts set the Graced apart from the rest of the world.    Enter Katsa, a young lady graced with amazing survival skills. She has been serving the Middlun king as his henchman since she was a child. But Katsa begins to realize that her Grace will allow her to do good as well, to fight the injustice in the world. Little does Katsa know that an ordinary quest to save an old man will turn her world upside down, forcing her to choose between what is right and what is easy as she helps those closest to her.    This was an excellently written fantasy story. I enjoyed the fantastic elements of the story, and I appreciated the concept of people \\"graced\\" with abilities above and beyond that of the average human being. The plot twists genuinely surprised me at times. I could barely put the book down, and I finished the last page definitely hungry for more.    HOWEVER ... I have to add one caveat. The LA Times likens this book to the Twilight series, and they had good reason to do so. The romantic subplot of the story is a necessary evil I may not prefer, but am willing to endure for the sake of the main storyline. However, every author or producer knows that it is possible to \\"shut the door,\\" so to speak, on a particular scene and leave out any graphic details. Readers are not stupid people, and they can generally figure out what has happened once the curtain falls or the lights dim.    Sadly, on at least one occaion Cashore fails to do this. Just because teenagers are interested in, are thinking about, or are actively involved in sexual activity does not mean that the adults around them should expose them to such thoughts. This would have been an excellent book, a book to put on my classroom shelf, without that one scene. If only there were someone out there who would write clean, good fiction for teens, something not preachy, but with a good worldview.
030726999X|4.0|4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />The spellbinding conclusion to Steig Larsson's Millinnium Trilogy opens with Lisbeth Salander being taken to the hospital after being shot three times. She's in critical condition with the bullet that entered her brain.<br /><br />Her friend, journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, found her and called for help. When police arrive, Blomkvist tells them that he tied killer Ronald Niedermann to a road sign and they could be taken into custody. He tells police to be careful of him but the police don't pay heed to his caution. As a result, Niedermann kills one policeman and severely beats the other.<br /><br />Former Russian hit man, Alexander Zalachenko, who is Salander's father, is also taken to the hosptial. He shot Salander and  burried her alive. Always resourceful, she manages to dig herself out, takes an ax and attacks her father.<br /><br />Inspector Modig and Criminal Inspector Marcus Erlander from the violent crimes division are investigating. Blomkvist asks Modig if she will make sure that there isn't a cover up for the crimes against Salander by the Secret Service, SAPO. They had brought Zalachenko into the country and declared Salander insane when she finally took action against her father for the years of extreme physical abuse he gave her mother.<br /><br />In this complex but suspenseful plot, Everett Gullberg is the former chief of Sweden's secret police. It was he who appointed Gunnar Bjorck, who was one of the major players in SAPO's recruitment and cover up of Zalachenko. Gullberg tells the current secret service group that they must work together to discredit Salander and stop Zalachenko from telling what he knows.<br /><br />The plotting and characterization were both done with skill. Lizabeth is at once, a most sympathetic character and yet resourceful enough to overcome all adversities.<br /><br />This is a significant work of literature very realistic and emotionally captivating. It does for Sweden what \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" did for Russia. The book could have used some editing but nontheless is an outstanding novel.ss is an outstanding novel.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|I really enjoyed this film a lot.  I was worried that it was just going to be a re-working of the 70's film \\"Silent Running\\", but after the first 15 minutes or so you realize that this is a very different story.  Sam Rockwell is great in the film as he pretty much has to carry the whole thing.  As others have mentioned there are a few plot problems, the main one being why someone would be stationed all alone in a situation like this in the first place.  Overall though I did not have too many issues with these things for the most part.  I won't give any of the plot away, but if you like thoughtful science fiction that is not an action picture I would think you would like this.
B002VWONB2|5.0|Since this is a must have item in any serious film collector library, one can only hope that the Blu-Ray edition is on a par with the film elements. In fact, it is one of my best looking transfers, with a pristine and sharp picture, from beginning to end. Warner could have improved the sound a bit, but it is not that bad for a film this age, anyway.

0439023483|5.0|Collins has devised an engaging dark future of North America.  After some un-named apocolyptic event that destroyed the old order of North America and a new order has arisen, replacing the old order with a North America that is governed, no, ruled, by \\"The Capital\\", a region that is someplace on the western slope of the Rockies.  There are also a dozen \\"districts\\" that work to provide the priviledged citizens of \\"The Capital\\" with whatever they want.  Members of the districts, however, live under perpetual oppression and hunger. And here's the set-up for the main storyline.<br /><br />Once a year each of the districts must send two \\"tributes\\" between the ages of 12-20 to participate in the annual media highlight called \\"The Hunger Games.\\" In these \\"games\\" the tributes must fight and kill each other until there is only one survivor, who is then a celebrity for life.  But, of course, this is only the backtground for what is really going on.  To figure that out, you need to read \\"Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />My recommendation? Read this book. I was so engaged by this book, the flow of events, the twists and turns of the plot, and the range of characters, that I sliced through this book in a day and half. I think that this book is appropriate for readers aged 11-101. At least I think that my 11-year old daughter would enjoy it. There are some scenes that are probably too graphic for readers younger than 11, and, let's face it, when you are 101, reading anything longer than the newspaper may represent a risky time investment :-)<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />I'm now working on book two of this series, \\"Catching Fire.\\" It's good too!
0307120007|1.0|This book was a waste of money for $9.99.<br />There are better books in the dollar store than this. I am thinking of returning it back but shipping might be a hassle as I never returned an item in Amazon before.

0451228375|4.0|Set some 200 years after the original, World Without End is, I am afraid, not quite as strong a book as Pillars. In the first place, there is no multi-generational project like the building of the cathedral to tie the book together thematically. In the second place, many of the characters seem like slightly modified retreads of characters from the first book; Caris for Aliena, Merthin for Jack, Ralph for William Hamliegh, etc. There is even a mystery set up in the first chapter that slowly unravels over the rest of the book. There is strong feeling of \\"d&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\" when reading this book.<br /><br />None of that is to say that this is a bad book because it really isn't. It is quite good and provides excellent insight into the Black Death and the effects its resulting labor shortage had on remaking the feudal system of serfdom and landholding. The beginnings of the 100 Year War are also described in terms of its effects on the characters. If I have a nit to pick it is that I would have appreciated a bit more description of everyday life especially how it differed from life in the 11th century setting of the first book. All in all it was quite a good book, if not quite as excellent as the first one.
B003FMTZOM|5.0|This album is really great is has everything from upbeat songs to slow ballads. My fav songs are Woohoo, Elastic love, desnudate and of course You lost me.
0439023491|4.0|The second installment in this series is good, really good, but, IMO, not as good as book one.  I liked the action and story development a bit better in book one, while the hunger games, though desperate, were not as engaging in book 2.  Not to worry though, there are still plot twists aplenty, and interesting new characters who interact with some of those from book one.<br /><br />The writing still flows well, the story does pull you along, and you, of course left hanging, waiting for the release of book 3...luckily that happens in only a couple of days :-)<br /><br />Thanks for another good read!  I really enjoyed it, and I look forward to book 3.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Angelina Jolie's performance is a tour de force enactment of the real Gia -- whose life was accelerated at rocket speed by the insatiable demands of the modeling/fashion world and her desperate need for comfort and belonging.  This is an extremely powerful film and one I consider a classic in my film library.  Supporting performances are stellar; construct of the film is equally profound.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Queen's Greatest Hits Volumes 1, 2 and 3 (a/k/a The Platinum Queen Collection) was released here in the US in October of 2002.<br />Prior to its release, it was available an import in 2000 via EMI using the 1994, 1991 and 1999 masterings on each disc respectively. Then Hollywood Records in both the US and Canada released this compilation in the fall of 2002 and the sound quality on the discs are superior to the flat sounding UK CDs as these used the 2001 remastering of Queen's catalog for release in Japan and were done at Abbey Road Studios by Peter Mew and the sonic quality is top notch. The booklet is great also with photos of the singles' 45s and various promo pics of the band over the years.<br />Disc 1 is the 1981 Greatest Hits in its original UK tracklisting featuring \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" which was Queen's biggest US hit which hit #1 in 1980 and a rock disco classic. Plus Queen's first US Top 10 and first UK #1 in 1975 hit out of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" which reached #9 in the US in 1976 and this classic needs no explanation (would reach #2 in re-release in 1992). We also have the band's first US #1 hit from 1980 out of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" which is a classic rockabilly romp. \\"Killer Queen\\" follows and was the band's first US Top 20 hit in Spring 1975 in the US and hit #2 in 1974 . Included is the single mix of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" which is a nice different version to the full album track and that was a Top 30 US hit in 1978 as was its A-side \\"Bicycle Race\\".<br />We also have \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\" which both hit #4 in early 1978 here in the US (the tracks are separate but the US record company insisted on playing the two together) and both are classic rally cry/victory cry songs and were #2 in the UK. Also included is the single mix of the song \\"Flash\\" which was the theme to the 1980 film Flash Gordon (did well in UK but not so well Stateside). Also on this is the US Top 20 hit from early 1977/UK Top 5 from 1976 out of \\"Somebody to Love\\" which was a great gospel tinged rocker. The 1976 US Top 20/UK Top 10 hit ballad \\"You're My Best Friend\\" which was the follow up single to \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" on A Night at the Opera is here. Plus you have the UK Top 20/US Top 50 hit \\"Play the Game\\" from 1980, great ballad.<br />The other tracks which were the rock radio hit \\"Now I'm Here\\" (a UK Top 20 in 1975), the classic \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\" (a UK Top 30 in 1977 but not released as single Stateside, instead it was \\"Long Away\\" that got released and tanked), the classic \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" (a UK hit but stiffed here in the US in 1974)\\", the big UK Top 10 hit \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" (which was well received on US rock radio but flopped on pop singles chart in 1979, Bee Gees and disco ruled the roost on singles in US) and the ballad \\"Save Me\\" (which was a UK Top 20 in 1980 but an album track here in the States as the song was not issued as a single in the US) round out the first disc.<br />Disc 2 is the UK version of Queen's Greatest Hits II which was released in October, 1991 in the UK.<br />It has two US Top 40 hits which were \\"Under Pressure\\" (which hit #29 Pop and Top 10 Mainstream Rock in the US in 1981) and \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" (which hit #16 Pop in the US in 1984) plus \\"The Show Must Go On\\" (which hit #2 when released in 1992 as double A-side with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"'s re-release). It also has some of the band's huge US rock radio hits out of \\"One Vision\\" (here in its single edit and superior to album version on A Kind of Magic IMHO) (#20 Billboard Rock Tracks in 1985), \\"I Want it All\\" (here in its single edit) (which hit #3 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart in 1989), \\"Headlong\\" (here slightly edited) (which hit #3 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart in 1991) and \\"Innuendo\\" (which hit #17 on the Billboard Rock Tracks chart in 1991).<br />Also here are songs that were hits in the UK/Europe but sadly tanked in the US which were the classics \\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Breakthru\\", \\"It's a Hard Life\\", \\"IWant to Break Free\\" (featured in its superior single mix) and \\"Hammer to Fall\\" (also here in its single mix). Also included here are songs that were singles in Europe but not here in the US but are great album tracks to us Yanks which were \\"The Miracle\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\", \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"Friends Will Be Friends\\" and \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\".<br />Greatest Hits III was released in November of 1999 and is seen as the sore thumb of the collection due to some of the re-mixes and collaborations and some solo tunes.<br />The outstanding are the new RAH mix of \\"Under Pressure\\" (which features some fresh work from Brian May and Roger Taylor and a verse at intro which was left off original song). \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is performed with Elton John from 1997 in what turned out to be Queen bass player John Deacon's last performance as he retired from the music industry a year later. The band's 1984 Christmas single \\"Thank God It's Christmas\\". The last song that John Deacon recorded with Brian May and Roger Taylor \\"No One But You\\".

Plus Brian May's only US rock radio hit \\"Driven By You\\" in its UK mix (I preferred the mix on the US version of Back To the Light with Cozy Powell on drums but such as life). Another knockout was the late Freddie Mercury's duet with famous opera soprano Montseratt Cabaet \\"Barcelona\\". I did dock a star or so from Part 3 due to the despicable Wyclef Jean remix of \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" which sounds like some bad gangsta rap crap.

0385341008|5.0|I love books set in the World War II time period, and this was no different. Most of the books out there are based on the larger cities, but reading about how the war affected those in the small town of Guernsey was a take that I thoroughly enjoyed. Seeing as how reading and learning how to survive among the Nazi occupation brought this group together was very inspiring. Also, I loved how the book was written in letters between the different groups, so you were really able to get a sense of who the characters were and what drove them. I definitely definitely recommend this book!
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Slayer is a band that never gives up there history.  This CD is fantastic capturing Slayer at it's best.  I just saw them live the other night and \\"World Painted Blood\\" and \\"Hate Worldwide\\" sounded great, f'n brutal.  It's funny how people alway's compare bands to how they were 20 years ago....Ask yourself \\"Are you the exact same?\\", \\"Do you look the same?\\", \\"Do you still sneak smokes and party at the creek behind the park?\\", \\"Do you still dress as Gene Simmons for Halloween? (maybe?)....probably not.    Great CD....
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I have just finished watching seasons 1 and 2, and am so happy to have found this show. I've always been a fan of fantasy science fiction books, and to a lesser extent, movies and TV shows (until the LOTR trilogy, which immediately became my favorite movies of all time). Anyway, I felt compelled to leave a review for LOTS (Legend of the Seeker). If you haven't yet watched LOTS... what are you waiting for? And if you did try it out and gave up after the first episode or two, I urge you to give it another try. I was continually delighted by the creative story-telling and talented acting. The episodes are unpredictable, the actors are believable, and you find yourself wondering how on Earth will it work out this time?! I liked how certain characters reappeared in later episodes. Also enjoyed the addition of Cara in season 2, and the added tension she brought to the group. You cannot imagine how disappointed I was to learn there were no plans for season 3. I can only keep my fingers crossed that ABC Studios finds it on their hearts to give us more of this awesome show. Please?!?!
B000002IP1|2.0|Say what you will about Phil Collins; his first 3 albums were as good as mainstream pop gets. I really wanted to like this one.  Sadly, B.S. (let's call a spade a spade) confirms his reputation as a toothless balladeer. Apparently his acting and soundtrack work tapped into his creative juices, because the writing here is not up to his usual standard. Nothing will grab you like &#34;Sussudio&#34;, one of the lesser songs from &#34;No Jacket Required&#34;. &#34;Hang In Long Enough&#34; is the only track with an edge, but it's undercut by a melody that sounds scotch-taped together. There are flashes of his old tunefulness, but he never sustains them for an entire song.  Of the much-hyped &#34;socially conscious&#34; lyrics, only &#34;Another Day In Paradise&#34; has anything original to say. It may have been moving when it came out in 1989, but now it just sounds manipulative. I wish he had included more songs like &#34;Take Me Home&#34; and &#34;Inside Out&#34; where the lyrics were open to interpretation, and less preaching.

0545123275|4.0|I love werewolves. So every time that a new twist is brought to the werewolf scene, I need to read it. I really liked this novel (and the second one even more so) but it seemed like the girl was just a little too obsessed with the werewolf. But sometimes--mostly in times of stalking--obsession can show how much somebody loves another. I mean isn't that what love is? An obsession about somebody so deep that all you can ever do is think, talk, and...obsess about them. It may sound creepy and a little stalker-ish, but that's teenage love for ya.     I would personally reccomend you to buy this if you can enjoy a romantic werewolf story that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. If you like all that stuff, which most people do, go ahead and treat yourself to this definite, heart-warming book.    Enjoy!!!
0143105566|4.0|If there is one genre which I have had difficulties in understanding, then it's Spy Fiction! Now in the great company of Graham Greene, even this strange genre appeals to me. This is a good book. Someone on Amazon wrote in a review that Greene never wrote a bad book. Is it really true? If so, then that's nothing short of amazing! Greene is somewhat a bit underestimated in the litterary circles, perhaps because he wrote books in popular style. In reality Greene is one of the giants of 20.th century litterature.
0060899220|5.0|Mr. Bourdain's story of not only his life but his opinion of the kitchen subculture was enlightening for his opinion of the behind-the-scenes cooks life but mostly for the point of view of working for personal satisfaction and not just for a buck. The chapters which described working all hours necessary, never being late, and doing things that may not be your job for the business really sunk in for me. The idea of thinking of yourself as a warrior in your life and doing your best no matter what is hard one to visualize but is portrayed over and over again kitchen confidential.<br />I enjoyed the stories, descriptions, and insights in the book a lot and will probably read it again but really what sunk in for me was the truly inspiring work ethic. If you want to know what doing your absolute best and putting in your all looks like, read this book.
0061777250|3.0|This is definitely one of the better books yet written about \\"consciousness beyond life.\\"  However, the startlingly small percentage of NDEs gathered by Pim van Lommel,M.D. and his study group is surprising - and not in a good way - the good way being if practically every person who is declared officially dead had experienced even some of the elements of the classic NDE.<br /><br />I found the discussion arguing for the brain's being more of a receiver of consciousness than a transmitter more valuable than the scarce accounts of NDE experiences offered in this book.  Most books on this subject relate the classic tale of a NDE patient floating from her body and seeing a sneaker high up on an outside ledge of the hospital where she was being operated on and at some point declared \\"dead\\" - and in this book we are told a story of a \\"dead\\" man seeing where the nurse put his dentures.  Both stories are the epitome of attempting to prove the NDE and OBE (out of body experience) - yet both stories are old tales without any substantially documented attempt to prove their reality.  The hidden code - placed high up towards the ceiling in many operating rooms throughout the world - has yet to be seen by anyone, despite accounts of the tunnel, the light, the life review and the meeting with people who have already crossed over being recounted once revived. But was it just a dream of the \\"dying\\" or \\"dead\\" person or simply a chemical being released by the brain?  The NDE has yet to be proven as an actual experience - and not just the sign of a creative imagination.<br /><br />Having said that, the author's strongest case for the brain being a receiver and not merely a transmitter is in his discussion of  neuroplasticity wherein thoughts can actually change a brain.  If thoughts can actually change a brain's structure, then the thoughts must be coming from somewhere outside the brain.  And this is where the author posits a nonlocal realm of consciousness.  The nonlocal realm is, according to the author, where pure consciousness exists and where our ability to be conscious likewise derives from.  When a person is dead, near-dead or even just meditating, they may experience this \\"cosmic consciousness.\\"  But to posit that we - our individual personality survives bodily death is not proven in this book: and I realize that that is not the author's intention.  His intention is to show that consciousness can continue independent from the brain - and this he succeeds in doing, in my opinion.  But for how long? How long does the individual consciousness continue - and that is, afterall, the hidden hope that that is what happens.  At least for most of us: the wrongs of this world are righted in the next, the ugliness in this world is made beautiful in the next. The hidden hope is that Death is the ultimate vacation from which we never need return to the mundane matters of the physically hampered world. But just as nails and hair grow for a time despite bodily death, perhaps the soul, whose origins are conceivably in the nonlocal realm, merely returns to Jung's \\"collective unconscious\\" or von Lommel's \\"nonlocal\\" realm and after a bit is subsumed by all consciousness itself.<br /><br />I was recently at the shore on vacation.  I stood by the shoreline and saw footprints of the people who had been there.  Let us say that we are like those footprints, we carbon-made entities.  And let us think of the ocean and its incoming waves as the nonlocal realm of cosmic consciousness.  Once the waves wash over the sand a few times, the footprint is washed away.  This may be what happens at death:  the NDE experiencer sees the wave, is in the wave for a time...until the wave washes away all trace of their individual footprint. Maybe that is why only some people experience the NDE: because they were on the \\"beach\\", closest to the wave, whilst others are further inland. To say that the entire universe may be built on consciousness or built by it is not the same thing to say that we survive bodily death for eternity, beyond space and time.  No, perhaps we just become part of the whole and - like the footprint in the sand - eventually lose our individual consciousness to the greater consciousness that may be behind everything in creation.<br /><br />So, the scientific arguments for a conscious life beyond bodily death - while not particularly new - were the most interesting chapters in the book.  Are they a bit complex?  Yes - and should be read slowly.  Do they make sense?  Yes, in a universe where quantumly \\"anything goes.\\"  Are some people prone to experience something of the nonlocal cosmic consciousness?  Most likely.  Does this mean that we live forever as individual identies?  No.  We may just return to the mystery that made us and never ever know why.<br /><br />The book is well worth the reading of it.  It is, to me, the best study of the NDE phenomena I've yet read.  But when will the sneaker on a ledge story - or now the old man's dentures story be replaced with something much more conclusive.  If I ever am having an NDE and I am in a hospital operating room, I hope I will be able to leave my physical body and see what the hidden on high code is. Then there would be much more strong proof that a person is more than their body, a mind more than its brain.odily death for eternity, beyond space and time.

He is basing his entire defense on the idea that \\"The Force\\" does not exist and he is not responsible for the deaths he caused.    He also got his bail reduced on the grounds that he was broke and could not produce the sum demanded by the court.    So this stuff doesn't work for its master practitioners.    ....And you think it might work for you? Good luck. Try not to drag anyone else down with you.
0307454541|4.0|This was such an interesting read, I found myself at times unable to put the book down!  I will admit I gave it a 4 star rating because the beginning is very slow, but it's necessary to fully understand all the characters and how they are related.  So if you can get past the slow start I promise it's very good!  Can't wait to start the other two in the series!
B000G73U5Y|4.0|How can you go wrong w/ Steely Dan?  It's an awesome collection.  However 3 of the tracks were scratched upon arrival.  Which stinks.  I hope when I send it back, it goes smoothly.
0307454541|2.0|I'm not sure I get what all the fuss is about.  I understand why the general outline of the story is compelling -- a writer and an investigator attempt to solve a decades old murder mystery, but it's either badly written or badly translated.  The characters are very stilted and the relationships are not plausible. I trudged through it, but wanted to quit a number of times.  There are moments of genuine suspense and excitement, but just not enough of a pay-off.  I also thought the side story about the writer and the libel charges weren't interesting at all which makes the story sputter to its ending.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|So I tried to jam three or four of the large, flat pieces into the XBOX's DVD tray. I kept getting read errors. Tried the Wii, I couldn't even get the pieces to suck into the media slot. I even pulled a couple of the old cartridge-based gaming systems out of the basement, built the appropriate sized cartridge out of LEGO bricks, and hooked it up to the TV. No luck there, either!<br /><br />So I finally called support. I was on hold FOR-EVER. Probably like, 30 seconds. That's ridiculous enough, but when the tech finally picks up, I'm connected to some Scandinavian call center out in who-knows-where. First thing's first, I ask the guy about his accent. He says it's *Danish*. Dude can't even put down his breakfast pastry to answer a support call?! Someone's DEFINITELY getting an anonymous flaming blog comment post about *that.* So I tell him about the problems I'm having. He keeps interrupting, clearly trying to follow some canned support script for beginners. DUDE, I'm TECHNICAL, OKAY? Skip your basic troubleshooting and let me tell you what I think the problem is!<br /><br />Anyway, so he says it won't run on ANY console or computer system. I say EXACTLY, that's why I'm calling. It won't run. He says right. I say so what do I do now? I already spent like, two hours trying to figure out where to install the batteries, so I know it's not THAT kind of game. He says it doesn't take batteries. I say yeah, I just said that, so I must be missing the power adapter, and I ask if he can overnight one to me. He says there's no adapter, I say right, there's no power adapter. Then silence.  Hello? I ask...You still there? Yes, he says. I say great, so can you send me a power adapter. He says \\"sir, there's no power adapter for this game.\\"  I say yeah, we've established that, you gonna send me a new one? He says there's not one to send. I say okay, how long's the backorder for replacement parts? He says no, they'll never get one in stock, because they don't exist.<br /><br />Don't exist?!? Place sounds more like \\"SCAMdinavia\\" if you ask me!<br /><br />I tell him as much, and ask to speak to his supervisor. After two more escalations and another 137 minutes of this whole \\"who's on first\\" routine and the next guy asks if I even read the manual! Again...I'm TECHNICAL. We don't NEED manuals!<br /><br />So anyway, I guess I'll keep an eye on their support site, see if they release new firmware or something. Meantime, we're playing with all the pieces. It's actually kind of fun...They've got these little picture cards in there (probably for some sort of TCG promotional tie-in) and my kid got the idea of trying to use the pieces to make little abstract versions of the pictures on the cards, while others try to guess at what the builder is making. Sometimes it's pretty easy, like a little house or a sailboat.  Other times, it's a bit tricky, like a Taj Mahal. (Here's a little recommendation if you try that one: don't build to full scale.  Five or six hours in, and you'll be out of space in your living room.)<br /><br />But either way, it's quite a bit of fun for the whole family...<br /><br />...Unless one of your family members would choke on small parts.  Or if Uncle Carl doesn't have enough manual dexterity to manipulate LEGO blocks. I mean, he'd probably still have a *little* fun, but only the guessing part, not the building part. Unless he's also recently lost his vision because he was looking at the sun during that eclipse even though the TV news guy said not to look directly at the sun or you could permanently damage your vision...then I suppose the guessing part would be pretty difficult for him, and since he also can't build, then the whole game would probably suck from his perspective. Why did you invite Uncle Carl to play, anyway? Didn't you realize how uncomfortable it'd be for the rest of us??<br /><br />So in summary: Doesn't plug in. Doesn't take batteries. Not a computer or console game. Fun for everyone who won't choke on it, exceptfor Uncle Carl.
B002ZCY7QY|4.0|I love this show, I'm glad it's being renewed for a 4th season!  I hate that feeling I get in April when I hear it's about to be canceled! :(  However, Universal needs to make this disc more affordable.  The season was shorter than previous seasons, and the storyline was not up to par!  Stop being greedy, and make the prices for your disc's fair so we can all afford them!

I agree though, there is nothing new about this 2 disc set.  I also agree that production must have switched hands.  Regardless it is still worth the money for this very cool piece of history.  Imagine a night with the family, connect a DVD player to a old B&W TV, shake up a pan of Jiffy Pop and go back in history! Love it!

It is incredible to read how Morton intertwines the stories of different characters. The House at Riverton was excellent, but The Forgotten Garden is even better.
B002RDCEX4|5.0|I don't post many reviews despite buying a lot of MP3s from Amazon.  Thought I had to share my excitement for this band as they are *relatively* unknown.  Got the album several months ago and it has not left my playlist.  Its got a very cool coldplay feel to it (_new_ coldplay that is).  The lead singer has a very versatile voice and gets into the higher octaves.  Really think the album as a whole is very strong.  If I had to make some recommendations about particular songs, I would recommend \\"down river\\" \\"sweet disposition\\" \\"love lost\\" \\"fader\\"... as you can tell, I love a lot of these songs.  Also if these guys are coming to your town, check them out.  Their live show at Lollapalooza was awesome and very well attended.
1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween and Year One are the most near perfect Batman graphic novels I have read so far. They both capture the essence of the character very well. As for the Long Halloween by itself, it takes the traditional origin of Two-Face that most fans of the comics know and twists it around to fit into a convoluted murder mystery. This approach in itself merits points for creativity, and its homages to various films from The Godfather to Silence of the Lambs makes it a treat for any film buff like myself.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|There are not many films that make sense about Iraq.  Most just want to relate what the grunts are doing in a hopless mess there.  This movie tries to provide some explanations.  While I don't buy into all the conspiracry stuff that action films like this often portray, there is little doubt that the Bush Admin. sold America a bill of goods on Iraq.  We invaded the country for no reason. We continue to pay the price for our folly today.  Intelligence was exaggerated and falsified.  WMDs did not exsit, even though Saddam acted as though they did.  The media fell in line with our corporate oligarchy and did not question the validity of our actions.<br /><br />This film shows the chaotic mess that our invasion produced there, and conveys the confusion of a mission gone wrong.  The cover up for WMDs that just weren't there seems a likely scenario. Normally I am not into pretty boy actors like Matt Damon, but he does a decent job portraying a special unit commander who is perplexed by the situation.  The film shows how we likely dropped the ball in not letting the Iraqi army cooperate with our occupation of the country.  We niavely thought US Capitalism would re-make Iraq and the Middle East. This film shows that well, and the stone-headed administrators like Paul Bremmer III, our Roman Procounseler who tried to run the country like a US corporation, and failed.<br /><br />Probably one of the best films to come out of the Iraq mess so far, even though I agree that its hard to follow at times and requires several viewings to get all the details down straight. I wish the film's extras had more on what inspired the original story, as opposed to Matt just bonding with the cast!  I regret all the sacrefices our forces have made there, as one US soldier's life is not worth all of Iraq!  Still, as a young nation we are learning the sorrows of empire as the British, who knew how to do these things a lot better, could have told us.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|The DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack was a great deal for the price, as it allows us to both let our daughter view her favorite movie downstairs on the home theater setup, as well as upstairs on her basic DVD player.  Great purchase.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Okay, obviously those of us who love Mrs. M, LOVE HER.  I went to this concert in Vegas and had to purchse the DVD/CD combo to extend the experience.  While the Sticky & Sweet tour was not as impressive as Confessions - it's still an incredible concert.<br /><br />The DVD is actually better than the concert I attended.  It's great for playing in the background if you have a BBQ with friends over, or while cleaning the house.  Who wouldn't be motived by Madonna's tunes and fabulous over 50 body?  The direction is impressive and the cinematoghraphy is gorgeous - capturing the show with Madonna's super high expectations.  She does not dissapoint her fans.<br />The framing and how they follow Madonna effortlessly is seamless and organic.  Better than many of the other taped concerts that are not as miticulously thought out.<br /><br />The CD is a heart pumping blast from the \\"Candy Shop\\" intro to the \\"Give it to Me\\" finale.  There's not much else that hasn't been said already, except that Madonna truly does give 100% and then some.  I'm pleased with my purchase.
B0016MJ6HY|4.0|The main feature of this film are the characters themselves - the plot almost feels secondary. With good writing and acting, the characters are all engaging and three-dimensional, enough to make you care about them. Norah Jones - a wonderful singer - is very good in her first acting role here, portraying Elizabeth, the lead. Elizabeth discovers at a corner cafe in New York City that her boyfriend has been cheating on her. She leaves his keys there and returns several times afterward to see if he came back for them. Each time, she gets to know Jeremy (Jude Law), the cafe owner, more and more. Jeremy waxes philosophically over the many keys people have left there and the blueberry pie which is almost always left over at the end of the night.    Clearly something begins to develop between Elizabeth and Jeremy; however, she is still working on getting over her ex-boyfriend. She moves across the country to Memphis, Tennessee where she goes by Lizzy. Trying to save money for a car and unable to sleep well, she gets two jobs - working at a diner during the day and a bar at night. At the bar she meets Arnie (David Strathairn), a policeman who is an alcoholic and cannot accept that he's separated from his wife. It's easy to feel sorry for Arnie, although it's clear he is flawed. Likewise, just when you might get to dislike his wife (Rachel Weisz), you learn to empathize with her situation too.    While Jeremy tries all he can to reach Elizabeth in Memphis by mail or phone, she moves on to Nevada. Here she goes by Beth and gets a job at a small casino. She gets to know Leslie (Natalie Portman), a poker player who has lost all her money. Leslie convinces Beth to lend her all her car savings; if she wins, she'll share the winnings with Beth and if she loses, then she'll give Beth her new car. When she loses, Leslie says she can have the car but she needs a ride to Las Vegas to see her estranged father and borrow money. Along the road trip, the two get to know each other more. Again, Leslie has issues such as her inability to trust anyone, but there's still some good in her too.    I enjoyed the characters and the story very much. My one criticism of the movie is the director's use of slow-motion. I felt it was unnecessary for the most part and he used it far too often toward the beginning of the movie. Otherwise, the movie was rather enjoyable. It included some wonderful music and nice cinematography. There was some humor, but for the most part it was a drama with some elements of romance.
B000B589JI|4.0|I've had this for a few days now, no leaking. Which I'm glad about, because some of the other reviews said they have leaking problems. And I was worried at first, because the package said Made in China. And not the everything Chinese is bad, they just don't have a very good reputation for good quality products. Thankfully it has the Zippo logo on it, so there must be a standard they follow to uphold the Zippo namesake. Inside the canister does have a rubber gasket that seals the fluid inside which is nice. And the nozzle with 2 holes is a very cool idea. The little rubber flint holder I find pretty much useless. I just use my Zippo to carry an extra flint or two. But the \\"Screw tool\\" does seem like it could come in handy someday. But who doesn't have a screwdriver? So even though it's nice to have, pretty much useless also. And agreeing with the other reviews, the clasp is flimsy, and looks like it will break at any time. Other than all of that, this is a pretty good product. I hope to still be carrying this in 10 years.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|For anyonewho's never seen the \\"big show\\" this presents an accurate depiction of what it's like to be there.  The camera angles are great, as well as the set list and enthusiasm of the British crowd.  It's a little different and awkward for Bruce, because it's a \\"festival\\" rather than arena setting, and he's a little more removed from the crowd than normal, but man, does he work hard to connect with his audience for three hours! Cinematography is gorgeous as the concert is shot from afternoon daylight into night.  Blue Ray is fantastic! If you love rock & roll, buy it.  You'll always remember every Bruce show you've attended...or you just haven't seen one yet!  Now you can do so without leaving your home!
B000000OUW|5.0|MORE RAW AND METAL than their Hail to England album or just a fantastic and they BLOW AWAY all other heavy metal bands out there. Probably one of the very best heavy metal albums ever made and the sound quality will break down the walls. Theres alot of that raw edge sound with the guitar and bass going, \\"de de de de de de de de de de\\", when you hear that in a metal song you know it can't get more kick butt. Fantastic metal songs like Return to the warlord, The Gods made heavy metal, Brothers of metal pt 1, King and more.
1400032717|2.0|\\"There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog.\\" The reader of 'the curious incident of the dog in the night-time' by Mark Haddon is drawn into the mystery quickly. However, I don't recommend this novel. Though it is unique, it has an odd writing style and few, if any, likable characters.        The author chose an unusual style of writing for the book.  It was written from the point of view of the autistic main character, Christopher.  For example, the chapters were numbered using only prime numbers because Christopher prefers them.  At times, however, the book becomes confusing because of this perspective.  At one point, the story leaped away from the murder mystery into an explanation of a math problem.  I didn't like how often the book digressed from the mystery.  I understand why the author wrote like this, but overall, I found it distracting.         In most gripping books after a couple chapters I find that I like one character more than the others. This was not the case when I was reading this book. None of the characters gave me a reason to like them.  I found the main character annoying and I struggled to relate to him. Personally, I don't like math and most of the time he obsessed about it.      I did enjoy how unique the book was. However, it is not a book I can recommend.

0765350386|3.0|I had high hopes for this book, but this book was much too easy to put down when I was busy [which I did often:] except for the last 150 pages. Then the pace picked up dramatically and I began to care what happened to the main characters. It's not a bad book, but not the best one I've read.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|I could not wait to replace my dvd set with the bluray version. The listing by Amazon said it was in 2.35 aspect ratio. Great, I ordered it. And it was not.

B003JTHESA|5.0|I listened to this a few times, and not all the tracks are winners, but the majority is very good with nice melodies and great musicianship. Yeah, it's a little different but that's ok with me. Bruce's voice in my opinion, just gets better and better as time goes by. I don't think it's as good as Dance of Death, but pretty much on par with AMOLAD. I'd have probably rated this a 4.5 stars if I could.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This is an amazing album. Much different than the last self titled album, but you will not be dissapointed. A must have for any A7X fan!
B00005JKG9|4.0|Have been wanting to get this flick for a long time.  Alec Baldwin's 10 min performance at the beginning is worthy of an Academy nomination....a must see if you're in sales.  Bought this item \\"used\\"....condition of dvd itself was excellent, dvd case was banged up a little but I think that may have occurred during shipping; that's the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5.

B00005MCX3|5.0|While I wouldn't call this their best or my favorite Hawkwind album, its still a must-have for the fan of Lemmy-era Hawkwind (or just a fan of Lemmy Kilmister, period)and a good intro to the uninitiated. Despite the album cover, the space rock themes and buzzing guitars have given way to a more \\"prog-rock\\" sound on this album. Mik Dik has left the band and newcomer Simon House, a classically trained musician, is prominent in the sound.     No fan of prog-rock myself, I still ended up reconnecting with this album for the second time in the early 80's when I very much a punk-rock fan. But, Hawkwind always had a following among punks (at least in the UK). This is truly music that many people can relate to 35 years after its debut. I acquired this CD recently, making it the third encounter with this album. Everyone who has heard me play this CD likes it. Even my five-year old son likes it, as well as my 40-something wife.     Motorhead fans will espeically like hearing Lemmy performing the original version of \\"Lost Johnny\\" which would later appear on the first Motorhead album. But, Lemmy is playing the all the guitars here, with a drone of a synthesizer in the background. The edgy nature of that song contrasts with the rest of the album, to the point that one can see that Lemmy was taking a different musical direction from the rest of the band. Even if he was kicked out of the band for other reasons, his departure was inevitable if you believe what the music tells you.        This CD includes a few additional songs that should have been on the orginal LP, but were probably cut due to the limited playing time of the old vinyl \\"Long Play\\" format. To be honest, I would have rather seen \\"Paradox\\" on the original LP version instead of \\"Goat Willow\\". You can find this great CD, both new and used, for really cheap on Amazon's marketplace. Thus, it really is too cheap not to own.
1601252463|5.0|The Pathfinder RPG's latest offering is an excellent addition to the game: a must-have. This book is very similar to the splatbooks that Wizards of the Coast (WotC) released for D&D 3.5, but without being confined to a small group of classes (and, frankly, without the garbage). The primary expanded areas are the addition of six new base classes, additional feats, additional class options, additional racial options, spells, prestige classes and combat options.<br /><br />The class and racial options are primarily substitution-based. They work on the principal of swapping a power for another, in most cases. This feels a lot better to me than defining a new race that is marginally different and trying to shoehorn them into an existing campaign world, as WotC has done many times. As for the class options, the substitutions are usually a package. The Ranger is expanded by adding several new combat styles (which I love, by the way), for example. The cleric options are the addition of subdomains, which are easy to integrate becaus the existing domains each have 2-3 associated  subdomains which swap domain powers. I've always loved the idea of customizing characters, and I feel this book really opens up possibilities.<br /><br />The new classes are excellent. I admit that I am not crazy about the Alchemist, but the others are top-notch. The remaining additions are the Cavalier (a fighter-type with bardic powers, focusing on challenging single foes and inspiring friends), the Inquisitor (a deity-sworn hunter), the Summoner (class focused on summoning a pet; think World of Warcraft Warlock), the Oracle (a divination-themed spontaneous divine caster) and the Witch (a hex-throwing caster whose familiar is her living spellbook). I honestly could see playing any one of these and having a blast, particularly the Inquisitor and the Witch. These all have distinct roles, none of which seem to step on the toes of existing classes. Their power also seems in sync with the other PFRPG classes (unlike the classes in the WotC splatbooks).<br /><br />The feats and prestige classes, while largely obligatory in a book of this type, avoid cheesiness. They expand the game well, and they make sure that the new base classes have the options the core ones were provided. Also of note are teamwork feats. WotC has offered these before, and basically, they are feats that are only useful when an ally has the same feat. I have always ignored these feats outright, but Pathfinder has made it so that two of the new base classes (Inquisitor and Cavalier) utilize these and either allow a player to grant use of one (a Cavalier power) or make so that your character acts as though your allies had the feat (Inquisitor). Without integration like these, these feats would largely be a waste of space. The prestige classes largely give advancement potential for new base classes, though some are the remaining PFRPG equivalents of the base 3.5 prestige classes (from the D&D 3.5 Dungeon Master's Guide).<br /><br />All said, I feel this book was worth every cent. I fully expect to use some of these options the next time I make a Pathfinder character. This book exemplifies the PFRPG's commitment to quality gaming material, and I recommend it highly.he classes in the WotC splatbooks).

B0015OKWL2|3.0|I had really high hopes for this film, and that may be why I was ultimately disappointed.  Pacino and De Niro are iconic actors, and their performances here are top notch - for what they had to work with.  The film's writer says in the extras, \\"I decide upon the twist and then build the movie backward from there\\" and that sums up my problem with the movie.  The twist was predictable, and there wasn't enough substance beyond that to take it to the next level.  The entire story is a set-up for the twist, and the pacing of the film is very slow.<br /><br />Someone is killing bad guys; the trailers and opening let the viewer know it's either Pacino or De Niro. The film jumps from one vigilante killing to the next, showing how the partners were involved or knew the \\"victims.\\"  There was a bit of surprise in the fall out (not who did it, but the why and what happens next) once the vigilante is revealed, but not enough for all the build-up.  Still, I gave it three stars because these two actors, and many fine supporting ones, are riveting to watch.  Pacino and De Niro are perfectly cast as jaded cops who keep doing the job because it's all they are made to do.  They have that certain quality that made Jerry Orbach so beloved on Law & Order.  Despite them being so famous, I still became lost in their roles. I knew who the killer was, and I kept watching to the end to see what these two would do with that knowledge.  Overall, this was a good drama but it could have been classic.  Recommended for fans of cop dramas, or of Pacino and De Niro.<br /><br />The DVD has two featurettes, and a commentary.  One featurette is a making of, and well worth watching.  I particularly liked how the cast and crew were so in awe of working with the two heavy weight stars.  Nice to know audiences aren't the only ones star-struck! The other is a kind of documentary on \\"bad\\" cops, but I found it very biased and quite negative.  They were stretching trying to tie it into the film and it showed.  Overall, decent extras for a single disc edition.extras for a single disc edition.
B000TEUSJK|1.0|I'm truly amazed by the number of positive reviews for Caligula. It's an awful, boring film that has gotten even worse with age because the shocking material isn't unique anymore. If you want to see it for the explicit sex scenes, troll the web where you can find them for free. It's just not worth watching the entire movie. The direction is awkward and aimless, the edits are jarring, the sets, costumes and make-up are amateurish, and the acting of the secondary players is weak. Malcolm McDowell makes a valiant effort to give his character some depth, but he's no miracle-worker. In fact, the only person able to rise above the material and bring some dignity to the proceedings is, not surprisingly, Helen Mirren. I really don't see any point to this film other than to shock audiences with sex and violence, and as I said, this won't even necessarily work for today's viewers; \\"Nine Songs\\" and \\"Hostel\\", just to throw out two examples, are far more convincing in each category. Seriously, don't waste your time.

B00111YM5G|2.0|I enjoy movies like this and Gabriel has excellent review. But I only enjoy them when they are well done.     The Fallen (Denzel Washington), Frailty (Bill Paxton) and even Constantine (Keanu Reeves) - even if the last wasn't faithful to the original comic it had merits of its own not to mention Tilda Swinton as the Angel Gabriel.     This film just passes on in a rather monotone manner and in retrospect I wasn't entertained. It managed a dark atmosphere well enough and the costumes were decent but the story was terribly lacking and what little there was had no depth. Occasionally it looked as if it was going somewhere and it did but not in a unique or clever way. Nor did the story build on legend or dogma it just went on in a juvenile way.     Fair enough the main danger in Purgatory is hopelessness and fear, helped by the fact that the Arcs (Archangel in a not so cool version) become human there - albeit with Angelic superpowers (making everything a bit confused). This we are told time and time again but telling isn't convincing in itself and the story lacks build up or credit as to how it happens.     The small budget is telling and for me I didn't hate it, but felt that my time could have been a lot better spent reading a book or sleeping.    In fact most Hellblazer books are superior in story and telling.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I recently got a Blu-Ray and my regular DVD was skipping a little bit, so I knew I had to purchase this movie again, so I went Blu-Ray. Love it! Mr. Darcy is right in your face and it's amazing! :) hehehe So glad I bought it.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 King Kong is exactly how to do a remake. This movie keeps to the spirit of the original, whilst including state of the art special effects and exciting action scenes. Jackson didn't try to add any silly plot twists or change the setting to 2005, but rather set out to remake the original film as it stood. He deserves a lot of credit for resisting the urge to \\"improve\\" the basic plot structure and settings of the original King Kong.     The only significant change Jackson made to the plot arch of the original is that Ann Darrow is no longer a vapid blonde yelling her head off, but rather an empathetic, subtle person who is genuinely moved by Kong's pain. This makes the movie much more emotionally sophisticated and interesting than its predecessor - and one of the few times when a remake truly does improve upon the original.     And what a remake. I thought the casting, effects, and soundtrack were great in setting the mood (Naomi Watts was perfect as the new Ann Darrow). The native Skull Islanders were absolutely creepy - a far cry from the silly natives in the 1933 version. Best of all, Kong himself looks superb, both realistic and empathetic. I nearly cried when he died.     Sure, the plot is contrived and it's filled with \\"Hollywood moments\\" of unrealistically impeccable timing. But at the end of the day, like its predecessor, this movie is about finding wonder in the world (or the movies). King Kong shows the epic struggle between the exotic, capitalism, and modern society - on unfortunately in which the exotic Kong meets his demise.     My only criticism of the movie is that sometimes the action can become too drawn out - one epic battle after another, after another... All of them are very well done and will get your adrenaline pumping. It might be too much for some people though. I love watching this movie once every few years, but could never watch it much more than that.     The best thing I can say about this movie is that it makes the original obsolete - Jackson's remake captures everything great about the original, while updating the special effects and filling it with an even better cast. Bravo!

0143038419|2.0|I just had to read this book that received so much attention and   is now a movie.  Took me a lot longer than usual to read as   parts were dull and the author was such a whiner.  I have read of cancer patients who didn't cry on the bathroom floor even as they faced horrible pain and agony from chemotherapy.  Sorry I spent the  money.
1400082773|5.0|I foun this book to be an extremely open and honest literary memoir that fused thoughs, ideologies, philosophy and the absurdities of life in a format that flowed as a result of his literary style, one that is eloquently descriptive and touched this reader on a very deep level.  This book has been a spiritual awakening of the providence of God.  I believe the young Harvard Law Review President broke the glass ceiling in that exclusive domain in order to break the ultimate ceiling of an exclusive white male dominated society of U.S. Presidents.  Personally, I could see throughout this writing, God's gentle guiding, I feel his selfless work as a Community Organizer in Chicago got him ready for the battles he would face as a Senator and on a larger scale as President of the U.S.  I believe that like Dr. King, President Obama has also followed the teachings of Ghandi in not responding to naysayers and all the negative press.  He is criticized by liberals who I believed supported him for his race rather than his intellect and found that his intellect was more than they bargained for and his race cannot be put in a neat package - he was sired by a pure blooded African and raised by a white mother and her white parents, only really meeting his father once at a young age, I believe 10, and his African relatives as an adult. I believe Barack H. Obama used his intellect and tenacity and brush with poverty to help turn around a nation facing more problems when he took office than any President since Lincoln.  I thank God Barack Obama wrote eloquently and shared a himself with the world through the book I just read:  Dreams From My Father.  All of us dream, but people with purpose who are willing to work hard learn to differentiate dreams from reality.  I think the writer, Barack Obama knew that journey is a quest that we spend the whole of our life sorting as we continue attempting to separate dreams from reality.
020161622X|4.0|This is a great book for any programmer, full of excellent advice. The subtitle \\"From Journeyman to Master\\" is not a joke, however; notice that beginner is not included in that range. Much of the book will not make sense if you do not have a decent amount of experience with programming.    The best thing I can say about the book is this: If you are not already following the advice in this book you are not programming up to your potential. If you read, understand, and implement the practices in this book you will write better software. It's not some load of theoretical crap, either; it's real advice for solving real problems. Good for programmers who care about getting work done today instead of sitting around talking about what they'll do tomorrow.
B0024FADAQ|4.0|One of the great films of the 1980's, in my opinion! I only discovered this film about 5 years ago, but it quickly became one of my favorites. I really love the CGI. It may not look like much compared to the visual effects we see today, but really ground-breaking at the time. The people in charge did a fine job venturing into the frontiers of computer graphics. Fine job by the rest of the cast and crew, too. Love Craig Safan's music!<br /><br />As for the story... It may seem silly to some--a teenager recruited through a video game to fight in an interstellar war--but it does send some really good messages. Like not underestimating one's own worth, and to seize the opportunity when it presents itself to reach one's goals.

B002RWKSII|5.0|To put my review briefly, I can't decide (on the 5th listening to the CD) whether I love the cuts that are closest to the original or the totally spectacular cuts that are 'hey, that's the Beach Boys'.  Whether its a haunting Someone to Watch Over Me, or a lively and totally beach inspired They Can't Take That Away From Me, this album is A#1 listen worthy and belongs on the playlists of both Gershwin and Brian Wilson fans.
1416955070|4.0|Life takes a turn for the unexpected when Clary Fray happens to witness a murder at the Pandemonium Club in New York. Things become more bizarre when she realizes that she alone can see the teenagers who are committing said murder. They haven't been witnessed by mundanes before, so they are very curious as to why Clary can see them. Things continue to spiral out of her control when her mother disappears, and Clary is attacked by something not of this world. Certainly someone will be able to figure out what is going on.  City of Bones ratchets up the action within the first few pages, and doesn't let up. The plot was engaging, fast-paced, and intriguing. The only complaint I had with the book was that I found the description to be a bit heavy-handed. Otherwise, the book was excellent. I loved the storyline. I loved seeing how the characters handled the situations they were dealt. This book had a few twists that I didn't see coming, but they made it all the more complex.   Clary was a character I quite liked, but at times I found myself rolling my eyes at her antics. She does show some growth throughout the book, and I can't wait to see how she's going to evolve next.   Jace was a mysterious character. He seemed aloof, superior, and conceited until we learn some of his history. He then is given more depth, and dimension. I thoroughly enjoyed his relationship, or lack thereof with Simon. The scenes with both characters in them brought a lot of humour to the book. I enjoyed the witty repartee between the main characters, and can't wait to see if some of the side characters become more prominent as the storyline continues.  All in all, an excellent start to what should be an epic series. The book is action-packed, and doesn't let up until its stunning conclusion. I can't wait to see what is going to happen next in this world!
B000ZELISO|1.0|Easily the worst HP movie of the series, it's almost amazing at how much this movie sucks!  It's acting isn't dramatic, it's action scenes felt out of place, the character's are so damn stupid I wish someone competent would come in and just bash their head in!      The Good:  -Alan Rickman as Snape is just perfect as always  -Cinematography wasn't that bad either    The Bad:  -Harry is a whiny brat  -Hermione is totally useless  -Ron seems to be the focus when it clearly isn't supposed to be  -The Death of Dumbledore isn't done well at all  -Draco Malfoy is a whiny b***h who can't do anything without crying  -The movie is BORING!!!!  -Still have one more book to cover....    This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Almost everything about it just sucks, and the absolute worst part is, there is still two more movies.  Yeah, the last HP book is so damn long that it needed to be split into two movies!  Hate this movie, dreading the next two.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|When I purchased Afterglow after it's release, I was a bit dissapointed. After the wonderful (and my personal favorite) Surfacing, this album was a huge step back for Sarah in my opinion.<br />But after several listening sessions this album really started to grow on me and I realised that it never got the attention it deserved.<br />No, there's nothing on this album that will remind you of Fumbling Towards Ecstacy or even Surfacing. But I for one am not waiting for Fumbling part 2 or any other part 2.<br />I love it when artists come up with something new. I would have gotten bored if Surfacing, Afterglow and her newest album Laws of Illusion would all have sounded like Fumbling extensions.<br /><br />Afterglow was influenced by her then marriage to Ashwin Sood, her mother's death and the birth of her first child, daughter India Ann Sushil Sood.<br />The album's lead single Fallen is classic McLachlan and the perfect choice for a first single. Other standout tracks are Answer, Trainwreck, World on Fire and Dirty Little Secret. But I actually never skipp any of the songs and for me that's what makes this album a good one.<br />I still give it 4 stars though, because with only ten songs it's way too short. Especially since back then we've waited six years for a new Sarah studio album.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This cable was a lot cheaper than most and frankly I think the picture is great.
B003JTHESA|3.0|A remarkable thing happened with Iron Maiden's last album, \\"A Matter of Life And Death\\"; an aging band that had no business releasing an album which ABSOLUTELY held its own against its seminal works of 2 decades ago, did.  Straight up best record since \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\\" Not only that, but as good.  The path to AMOLAD was spotty, though. Coming off the 2 ill-fated Blaze albums, not to mention the abysmal \\"Fear Of The Dark,\\" the reunited +1 (Gers) Maiden came out strong with \\"Brave New World.\\" Not their best, but very good, very consistent; it served to silence the my nagging fear that they just wouldn't have it anymore. A solid return to form.  Then things went to hell, and not in a good way. 2003's \\"Dance of Death\\" was a tepid, turgid, sterile affair, boasting all of one great song (\\"Montsegur\\") and maybe 2 others that were decent. And don't even get me started on the botched Dave Patchett artwork.   So I'm thinking, alright, NOW they're done. I pretty much stop paying attention. 3 years later, \\"Matter\\" hits the shelves and I buy it mainly out of old school loyalty, expecting little. And I have my head taken off: an album packed with long, complicated songs, songs full of ideas and flow and energy, songs that do exactly what they're supposed to. Damn CD almost ended up fused to my player; read my review of it for more gushing.  Now its 2010, and we have \\"The Final Frontier.\\" And suddenly things are back to \\"meh.\\" Don't get me wrong, its better than \\"Dance of Death,\\" but it just seems...uninspired. The opening/title track has a cool intro that sees the band stretching, but then drops into song that leaves the listener going \\"Really? That's all?\\"  A few shorter songs follow (by the way, don't trust late-era Maiden songs shorter than 6 minutes), including the inexplicably-hyped \\"El Dorado,\\" and \\"The Alchemist,\\" a decent tune that for some reason shares its title with the stellar closing track on Bruce Dickinson's superb 1998 solo album, \\"The Chemical Wedding.\\"  Then we hit the album's one great track, \\"Starblind,\\" which evokes shades of \\"Infinite Dreams.\\" After that...its all long songs: 8, 9, even 11 minutes. And while they all have their moments, they suffer from something we haven't seen much of since Blaze-era snoozefests like \\"The Clansman\\": way too much repetition. Not lyrically, but musically. These songs have like 10 verses each, no strong choruses, and the verses themselves are stretched over boring, chugging chord progressions. Where're the melodies, guys? Sure, there's some, but on the whole, it all sounds thicker, more monotonous, and less dynamic than anything they've done in a long time. We're back in the land of \\"Why 3 guitarists again?\\"  In addition, Dickinson is singing lower, and in many cases, right along with the guitar lines. And he seems to be having phrasing issues with some of the lyrics again, unless of course he penned them. His voice still sounds good, but he's not really stretching on this one.   Part of the problem is Maiden's perpetual identity crisis, their desire to do the more progressive thing, yet also churn out the occasional up-tempo rocker. This album was recorded in the same studio as \\"Piece of Mind, \\"Powerslave,\\" and \\"Somewhere In Time,\\" and one gets the sense that they're trying--again--to capture the vibe of those bygone days. Bad idea: what they do well now is different from what they did well then, and it would serve them well to accept that. Had \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" been written and recorded for the first time now, it would sound silly; the reckless macho energy of youth is an essential component in songs like that one. These guys aren't 25 anymore, and while no one can blame them for WANTING to be, they're just not.  All that said, its still an enjoyable listen. Like hanging out with an old, trusted friend. And to be fair, they set the bar extremely high with \\"Matter\\"; some disappointment was to be expected. I guess what's ultimately disappointing is that we all knowthese guys are still capable of bringing it 100%, but for some reason on this album, don't.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|A rather strange trio to throw together, but what great fun to listen and watch them play together.  No big revelations other than I have a lot more respect for the edge as an artist than I did before.  I hope when I'm Page's age I can still play at all; the man still rocks.  Jack White is a nut. \\"Go on!! Pick a fight with it!!!!\\"  If you buy this movie with no expectations other than to be thoroghly entertained you'll do just fine, just get a beer, crank up the surround sound and enjoy.
1843106698|5.0|This is the BEST book about Asperger's Syndrome.  I have ready many & this is by far the most informative.  It really helps you understand why some reactions happen & it also makes you aware or notice that some reactions are symptoms of the syndrome.  You just have a better appretiation of some of your child's quirks.  I think it should be required reading for any person in education or with any daily contact with children.
B001QOGYFO|4.0|I just recently saw this movie and did not know what it was about but I really liked it. Although it was different it provided for me the same suspense and thrill of \\"The Thing\\". There were 2 great fight scenes and in the first one where the heroine eventually lost 2 of her fingers I was jumping out of my seat in terror. It is a good who dunnit. I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I like it when \\"tough\\" chicks win out.
1423121708|5.0|Posting for my son for his summer reading assignment:    This summer I read Percy Jackson and the Olympians by: Rick Riordan. The main characters are Percy Jackson, Grover, and Annabeth Chase. They are three friends that meet because of their unusual lives of being demigods except Grover the satyr. But Percy and Annabeth thought they were normal people.                  Percy lived a normal life and never knew he was a powerful demigod - son to Poseidon. His mom and Grover hid the truth until an evil creature came to find Percy for a crime he did not commit. He goes to a place to wield his powers. That's a problem, because he doesn't know who his dad really was. When he arrives, he is attacked by another creature which takes his mother. He is an outsider to everyone except a friendly counselor named Luke. Luke is the son of Hermes. Over time Percy goes to a camp for half-bloods or demigods. As days pass, it looked like it was going to storm at the camp. That doesn't normally happen at this camp. So everyone at the camp acts normally until a game of capture the flag chills everyone. A vile creature enters the camp and is killed by Chiron - the teacher of Percy. During capture the flag, Percy was hurt and a voice in his head tells him go to the water. He does. When he touches the water, he gains power and then realizes he is the son of Poseidon. Chiron then knows Percy has a quest to find what was stolen. As he gets ready and heads out, Grover and Annabeth go with him to help him with his quest.                  As they were leaving the camp, Percy heard his prophecy and the first part lead him to the underworld.  So Percy and his friends took a Greyhound to get to the farthest away from the camp as possible.  Another vile creature sent by Hades attacked the trio on the bus and they had to go on foot and the group found a garden store on their way called: Aunty Em's Garden Gnoughm Emporium. They met the owner, who is a nice old lady or so they thought. The woman was actually Medusa. They fought with her until Percy ended her life. As they went on with their journey, they ran into more traps and powerful beings. They find themselves at the Arch in St. Louis.  Annabeth`s love of architecture led them up the Arch. On the observation deck of the big building, all was fine. But as Annabeth and Grover went down, Percy ran in to Enchina, the mother of many monsters. As he stood there in awe, her son the Chimera was attacking him. The Chimera blew fire, which put a hole in the wall of the Arch and hurt Percy by biting him with his snake tail. Below Percy there was water and he jumped and lived.                   The group was starving and stopped at a diner were a strange man found and gave them a task so they did. But the man was not trustworthy, because he is Ares god of war. His job was done and they were rewarded with a lot of things. With the new stuff they acquired, it helped them to get to Las Vegas where they got stuck by magic. When they left they got a ride to the underworld and in a matter of time found Hades. They accused him of theft, but it was not true. Percy then left for Olympus with fear. All along, Ares was the so-called thief, but he had help. So Percy returns the bolt to his uncle and is cleared of his bad name. He goes back to camp and found out that Luke was the evil helper. Luke runs away, leaving Percy wounded mentally and physically.          I would recommend this book to friends that like books that have adventure and action. I thought this book was great and would advise people to read it. It's probably one of the best books I've ever read.

0307266303|5.0|I've been running for a few years now and have a few half-marathon's done. I've struggled through injuries on my way to getting into running shape and taking on a full marathon. This book gives me a whole new perspective on my entire approach.     I started running to loose weight and attain cardiovascular fitness. The doctor told me that my cholesterol was high and my blood pressure could be an issue if I didn't change something. I decided to take on running, I experienced blisters, plantar fasicitis, and most recently and hurt IT Band. Injuries haven't stopped me but I am always wondering what I need to do different to get those miles done and build my base.     This book has given me a renewed sense of awe and a connectedness to the running that I do. After reading Born to Run, I am enjoying my runs more and having more fun. I'm going to do my first trail run in a couple of months.    I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great story, especially if your'e a training runner.
B003O86MY8|5.0|I saw a commercial on TV about this album, and thought I would order it.  I have always been a fan of the group BOND, and I though the music would be similar, and it was, I enjoyed his arrangements of familiar songs, done with a classical spin.  Everyone who has listened to it loves it also.  It was a great addition to my collection. I urge everyone who loves good music to order this album you will not be sorry.  Every song is worth hearing.

B003NX76BM|5.0|Yes I agree there was a lot about dog training.  But as an owner of an unruly dog I found it funny. This also made it different from anything I've read lately. If you enjoy getting deep into a characters life then you will enjoy this!  And if you are a dog lover you will laugh as you recall all the trials you went through having a puppy!    I read this in two nights. And was kind of sorry it ended so soon,
7885142434|5.0|I'm not sure what the last reviewer is talking about. The English subtitles on this DVD are perfect. I'm wondering if his seller sold him a different DVD? The movie is great. If you haven't seen IP MAN yet, get it. Then get this DVD and watch it right after. I'd have to say that the first IP MAN was a bit better, but I'd give the first one 5 stars, and this one 4 1/2 stars. The DVD is great quality. It is a DVD-9 with a high bit rate transfer and an excellent picture. The subtitles as I have said are excellent quality. This DVD is uncut. I saw it the first time in Hong Kong. I previously bought this movie on DVD, and it had about 5 minutes cut from it, so I'm happy this DVD is uncut. Highly recommended.
B003O86MY8|5.0|This new release was eagerly anticipated and did not disappoint.  I loved it. It's more of that awesome crossover that he does so well. And just as the title says \\"Rock Symphonies\\", it truly is a blend of rock and classical that no one could have created but a true master like David Garrett.   If I could change one thing, this album should have had the Mission Impossible theme on it as he performed it in the latest PBS concert.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|My husband and I received tickets from dear friends to attend the last show of this tour (in Anaheim, CA) as a wedding present.  I hadn't seen James Taylor live in almost 30 years - He's still got it!  I was amazed at the energy he and Carole King still have and they're a couple years older than we are!  Their voices haven't lost a note than when I first listened to them so very long ago.  What a treat!    I ordered this set the next day so that we could have this in our collection of classics at home.    What an amazing show and a historic event!
B002ZG980U|5.0|In the 2010 movie summer we were desperate for a really good movie. Something really smart, clever, action packed,  and suspenseful. And knowing Christopher Nolan, we were going to get more than what we bargained for. This is easily the best movie of 2010. This movie combines the elements of what we love in a movie, hotel fights (Zero-G, nice touch), mountain fortress brawls, etc. After what we had this year, we may have been desperate, but Nolan is our savior. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a very complicated character, only a handful of people couldve done what he did. Both films that he was in this year bended our minds (Shutter Island and Inception). Joseph Gordon Levitt plays a very likeable character. Ken Watanabe is very dark character, in the beginning you think he is the antagonist, but it turns out he is not the bad guy. Ellen Page plays as \\"the newbie\\" in this film, new in this field of work. Tom Hardy also plays as a very cool character, he holds some comic relief in tormenting Joseph Gordon Levitt at some parts. Dileep Rao plays as a very likeable character as well, he knows his stuff. Cillian Murphy is the target or client in this movie. Marion Cotillard plays as the antagonist, and every time she appears it widens your eyes cause you know something will happen. If mindbending was a martial art in The Last airbender (which it failed to do, at least we still have that epic show) Christopher Nolan mastered it. No character is annoying, every character is likeable. You feel bad for Leo in this movie. And the ending will make you throw a fit because it brings that good \\"awwww\\" not because it is bad. This is an instant classic, in 20 years people will look back and say \\"Inception is a true classic.\\"
142313494X|4.0|On a field trip with his sixth grade class, New Yorker Percy Jackson accidentally vaporizes his math teacher. Strange things have been happening to him his entire life, but this one seems to take the cake. About to be expelled from yet another school, he returns home in the summer, and, with his mother, goes to visit Long Island. One night disaster strikes, and Percy's mom tells him to head for Camp Half-Blood.    While at the strange camp, Percy discovers that he is the son of one of the Greek gods. His strange behavior, trouble in school, severe dyslexia, and ADHD can be traced to his roots - he is a great fighter, and it seems that his brain is wired to read ancient Greek rather than English. While at the camp, he befriends two campers: Grover, a satyr who observed him at his boarding school, and Annabelle, a daughter of Athena.     All is not well in the world of the Olympians. Someone has stolen Zeus' master lightning bolt, and if it is not returned by the summer solstice, war will erupt between the gods. Percy suspects that Hades is behind the theft, and he and his friends are assigned a quest to track down the bolt from the Underworld (which, ironically, is located in Los Angeles). Along the way they face mosters, Furies, as well as several other gods, including Ares, as they attempt to right the world of the gods and prevent war. But is Hades truly behind the theft? And will someone betray Percy as he tries to complete his quest?    \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is the first of five books written by Rick Riordan that combines a modern-day hero with Greek mythology. It's cute, engaging, and portrays the gods in a real-world light. But I couldn't help comparing it to that other series of books with a modern hero - Harry Potter - and this one comes up slightly short. Still, it's a great page-turner and a wonderful way to look at the world from a Greek point of view.
B0002LMLAY|1.0|I am astonished to see all the positive reviews of this mediocre album.  I listened to it a couple times back in the '70s when it first came out, because I was a major DP fan, but when I heard this, I was bummed.  I've listened to it a couple of times since, and it still is very apparent to me that this is just mediocre stuff that was put out in the effort to leverage the Deep Purple reputation.  This is surely the band that Rob Reiner had in mind when he came up with Spinal Tap.  Not MKII Deep Purple, but this truly forgettable counterfeit incarnation.  I can't believe that this was even re-released on CD.

B00003CWL6|4.0|How to escape the circuit of dreams that bind you? American Beauty, which shines through an exciting plot that leaves you thinking and moved tells the American Dream from the perspective of the protagonist, Lester Burnham, a family man who is going to fulfil his personal idea of the American Dream which ruins his family life in the end. The film has a circular structure, beginning with Lester, saying that he will be dead in less than one year and ending with a monologue by him when he´s deceased.  Lester is about to quit his work career just to get in touch with the most less amount of responsibility from now on. Moreover, he finds the friend of his own daughter Jane, a teenager, attractive and is completely lost in her.   While Lester´s wife Carolyn is having an affair and completely focused on her own career, Lester is doing his own stuff regardless of what´s going on around him. He is even losing connection with his own daughter who starts to hate him due to his embarrassing behavior.  And that is how things are in American Beauty: tricky and destructive: A trigger got pulled and there is nothing to do to push things into another direction.  The characters are pretty coloured.   We find Carolyn on the one hand, who is masquerading. Lost in her career, she is trying hard to keep a certain status, not accepting that her husband can´t share her lifestyle anymore.  She is one of those characters you feel pity for as a viewer.  Lester in contrast of that is the typical movie hero. For realizing his dreams in a kind of innocent way, the things he wents through, for paying the bills in the end.   The most incredibly played character is that of Ricky, a typical weirdo from the eyes of most people. The reason i mention him is because he deserves a special treatment for he is already at a point of life that Lester is trying to reach hard.  The director, Sam Mendes,  is obiously  criticising  \\"the AMERICAN way of DREAMing\\" by all the symbols and sequences you can see that show and deal with the naked truth of life. All dreams that come along in this movie will be ruined in the end. What is all money and influence good for if you get never in touch with all the beauty life can offer ? One can´t live with and not without the American Dream when there is no balance with life´s beauty.  I definitely recommend the film for the simple fact that it is dealing with life in a unique way.   Once a movie can move you - it has done it´s function. And if that movie can even entertain your mind, eyes and ears all at once, it must be worth watching. Clever and smart but also with shocking elements. A ying yang - movie: many contrasts that clash on each other but get balanced out in the end.   By M. Ü.    Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is this kind of guy who has forgotten to live even though he has reached the suburban-lifestyle a lot of people attempt to achieve. His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) works as an estate agent and she is still filled with ambitions. Jane (Thora Birch), Carolyn and Lester's teenage daughter, goes to high school and attends the schools cheer leading group. The familiar situation begins to escalate as Lester recognizes that he cannot suffer the emotional side by side life any more. Motivated by Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), Jane's friend, who reactivates his long lost libido, he decides to drastically change his life conditions. Therefore he quits his ordinary office job in favor of applying as a Smiley Burgers(tm) service member like he used to in his childhood. He tries to regain his lost youth. But the familiar situation escalates even more.  Even though Lester is one of the coolest characters towards the end of the movie, in the beginning of the movie he is a coward without confidence. As his character progresses, he appears more and more as a rebel. This character development is initiated by the self-awareness of his former boring and very common lifestyle. He tried to life a second youth, gaining the coolness andself-assurance he failed reaching in his first. This is a quite interesting development because in fact he already reached everything which is part of the common American Dream. He already had a family, a recognized job, a large house and two cars - but obviously these things were not the ones which made the point for him. Now he is trying to start over again, to reach a better relation with his daughter and wife and to finally enjoy life intentionally.  On the other hand, there is Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Ricky is the son of the new neighbors of the Burnhams, he goes to the same school as Jane does. On the first sight he seems to be no more than a strange guy, but after a closer look he turns out to be sensitive and straight forward. Not in terms of realizing the material part of the American Dream, but in terms of living life intentionally. In this context Ricky is the exact opposite of Lester. At least, as the movie starts. As the movie progresses Lester continuously develops towards Ricky's attitude. And as it ends you hear him say what Ricky had already recognized long time ago.  You might compare American Beauty to similar films but honestly there are no similar films, there is nothing comparable. American Beauty shows us a unique view on the American Dream particularly emphasizing the negative flipside of the American Dream. We never even considered how wrong and bad the American Dream could be. Our surfaces are mostly polished and cured from everything what could be considered as a bad trait but underneath this kind of masquerade the real needs become obvious. Namely the need to live how we really want, to live our lives with our unique way of American Dreaming and not just using what is commonly assumed as the typical American Dream template. We should learn to tailor our own dream, this is the message.  All in all, we would fully recommend this movie, because it shows a shocking version of dozen failed American Dreams bunched in one or two families, contrary to the mostly used Happy-World-American-Dream. Did i say failed American Dreams? Failed - yes, in terms of family living and the pursuit of mental happiness. Failed - in terms of getting the suburb status, having a family, having a house, own a diversity of material goods - absolutely no. It depends on the point of view and what you define as failed in this case. The author emphasizes particularly every imaginable negative part to sensitize the audience and to assault their deep rooted picture of an American Dream. And this is the only one weakness of the film, it feels like science fiction. As the viewer I would say \\"Nope, this would never ever concern me\\" but with some more realistic circumstances the author could reach something you might say unreachable through films, namely a drastic change in our minds.  Putting it all together, this movie is a typical example of persons forgetting to enjoy everyday life while they are pursuing their aim of a better life in the future. According to the path-goal theory, the journey is the reward. And even it all end in tears within this case study, it does point out the responsibility we all have and always forget - the responsibility not to forget to live.  So, American Beauty isn't just a sort of roses as commonly assumed, it is even more a metaphor used in movie's title to concentrate the message in one striking word. Well, where is the beauty in our daily life? In fact it can be found everywhere, because it is everywhere. The sticking point is that we need to have the sensitivity to identify and feel it, no matter where it is. Does it sound strange to you that the beauty of our world can be found in a plastic bag? If yes, than you should definitely watch this movie.  By C.V. and R.B.    American Beauty is a story about a family with Lester (Kevin Spacey) and his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who are stuck in their joyless and unlovely marriage. Their relationship is plodding aimlessly at this time. Both of them are unhappy with this situation. Carolyn is only focused on her career as estate agent. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) finds her father disgusting because of his lack of communicating with her. Once he quits his job and starts his youth revival he works at a burger company, and lays eyes on his daughter's schoolfriend Angela (Mena Suvari), though, Lester is suddenly changing his whole life. Freed in his mind from the life that was strangling him. But everything has consequences.  Carolyn, the third main character, is stubborn in her doing she wants to be the best estate agent and she is proud of her house and life standard. Jane is a beautiful girl but she don´t see it. She want to have a normal family but her family is a shame for her. She is a person that gives people a chance and she tries to see behind a masquerade which is pointed out while she gets to know Ricky the new neighbour.  The most interesting character seems to be Ricky, who is a supporting role but his behaviour is interesting too: he is a boy different from others. He is filming very much and often but he does it to see the good sides of life. He is filming things that are beautiful. In a scene he shows Jane his greatest film. And it shows a bag that is dancing with the wind. This shows me that there are always beautiful things. Carolyn is the character that I reject most because she is bitchy and too much focused on her job, her roses in the garden and her reached economic status.  The director wants to express that the American Dream, namely to pursuit a better job, a better a house, a better family, a better life, etc. has consequences and he points out that it is very often a masquerade.  For me the message of the film is to avoid being egoistic and live a life with a masquerade - but also to see the little beautiful parts of life.   by J.F.    The movie American Beauty deals with the last moments in life of Lester Burnham, who lives with his family in a suburb of an American city. The focus ison Lester's thoughts about his last days in life. The viewer gets an impression of his family and personal environment and, furthermore, it is possible to see the way people who are close to Lester live their American Dream. The film ends with the conclusion that everything is a masquerade.  The main character is Lester. After he gets into his midlife-crises, he begins to live his American Dream. So he starts working out his body, he buys things he dreamt of his whole life (like a new car): He gets back to a life of drugs and Rock`n Roll and is in love with Angela, the friend of his daughter Jane. At the end of the movie you can see his soft character when he is in the situation of having sex with Angela and he finally refuses.  As an important aspect Lester is connected to all other characters of the story. He comes into a personal bond with every character.  Instead of identifying  with only a single character of the movie, it is easier to identify with each character. Everyone wants to be successful as shown by Carolyn. Everybody aims (at least a bit) for beauty like Jane. Like Lester, many would like to be athletic, fit and enjoy life.  Personally, I think it is very easy to reject someone in the story. Ricky's father, a brutal man who is not capable of dealing with his son and his wife in a lovely way. He also denies his feelings for men. The intention of the director was the suggestion to the public, namely to make themselves think about the meaning of life. Is the American Dream the meaning of life ? You can have the impression that the director criticizes the American Dream. The main message could be that the American Dream does not necessarily make everyone happy.  Compared to movies I know this one has inspired people to think about their own lives and the way of life, as you are and how you want to be. Life can be very short. The American Dream could symbolically stand for the American society. On the surface, many things look pretty and beautiful. But inside it could mostly be broken. A strength of the film is the camera movements in combination with the sound. I like the presentation of the film, which begins with Lester's story and is repeated at the end. The weakness of the film is an exaggerated portrayal of the characters.   Whoever has the desire and joy to a combination of a typical American film and American culture, should watch the movie. It is a film with a bit of irony and cliché as well as scenes with reflection.   by I.A.    American Beauty was released in 1999 and directed by S.Mendes. The film takes a look inside the suburban middle-class houses of some average families, at least by all appearances. The focus is on Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and their daughter Jane (Thora Birch). All of them are missing something in their lives, and everyone of them has its own way to compensate these absentees, but neither of them knows how to solve their problems.  Lester Burnham is a middle-class man with a daughter who doesn´t love him and with a wife who spends more attention on her career than on her family. There is also the fact of his mid-life crisis, which makes him feel old and unloved. At this point he finds himself fantasizing about Jane`s school friend Angela (Mena Suvari), due to that he starts to rebel, he quiets his job and began to work at a fast food restaurant. During her father is living his 20s again, Jane recognizes his sort of interest for Angela and that gains her dislike for him.  The characters who surround Lester and his family are equally fascinating, for example Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper), who doesn`t introduce himself without mentioning his army background and rank. His wife seems mentally disturbed due to the constant struggle between her son and her husband which is caused by his drug dealing history. Their son is a quiet guy who videotapes everything and seems to be a \\"tech geek\\", he finances himself, by still selling drugs.  All these characters are unified by one thing, they are hunting for their \\"American Dream\\". Not one of these characters is really bad, some of them are likeable and even loveable. The movie creates rather of a mood than a actual theme or message, even that mood is hard to describe. You have to see it, that even by seeing it you may not understand it. All I know is I would recommend this movie for its interpersonal relationships, its black humor and its amount of hope by the end.  by. K.-H. S.    In American Beauty we see Lester and his family who are broken. The American Dream is a problem for them. Lester doesn´t like his job anymore. He quits and changes his life style. He wants youth and is in love with a teenager. Her name is Angela and she is the friend of Jane who is the daughter of Lester. His wife Carolyn is living the American Dream. She has a good job and her career is important to her. Lester and Carolyn are only fighting and Jane suffers because of them. Later Jane finds Ricky, a neighbour the first boy that is interested in her and who gives her the feeling to be important. With him by her side she changes her personality. They like each other. Ricky is a very strange person. Mostly he is recording simple things in life. Even when Lester is dead, Ricky thinks that this situation is beautiful.  Angela is Jane's best and only friend. She is a men dream because of her look. She is the opposite of Jane and is very self-confident. Her interests are boys and her looking, but at the end the viewer learns the other side of her.  I think that the director wants to show us the dark side of the American Dream. It can be bad for someone to forget about real life and think only of realizing the American Dream. Both live at first the American Dream, they have everything someone can dream of, but after Lester quits his job the question turns why he does it even he had all which means the American dream is achieved. Why does he want to leave this? Only to be a young man without responsibility? Every viewer can decide himself. It is a movie with a little bit irony but with an earnst confidence. Try to get the confidence. About how the society must be and how the society really is...it's worth watching. You will not have any regrets.  by L.S.    The American drama \\"American Beauty\\", released in 1999, is about a middle-aged office worker, husband and father who suffers from a midlife crisis as he feels sexually attracted to his daughter's friend Angela. He gets involved with her after seeing her dance at a basketball game. As Lester fantasizes about Angela in a sexual way, red rose petals are a repeating and recurring motif which emphasize Lester's sexual attraction towards Angela. Meanwhile Lester's materialistic wife Carolyn, a real-estate broker, begins an affair with a business partner, their daughter Jane gets involved with Ricky, a marijuana smoking drug dealer and neighbour. Lester tries to get back being younger by working out hardly and also smoking marijuana as he overhears Angela telling Jane she would find him sexually attractive if he changed and improved his looks and physique. When Lester is about to have sex with Angela, he stops because of her being a virgin. By the time Lester discovers his wife's affair and Ricky convinces Jane to flee to New York City. In the end, Lester gets shot by Carolyn and dies.   The main characters in this film are Lester (Kevin Spacey), his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and her friend Angela (Mena Suvari). In addition Lester is shown as an easy going but loving father and also capable of being influenced, for example by Jane's friend Angela. Carolyn seems to be a materialistic and cold hearted wife, only having her ambitions and business in mind while Jane appears to be an emotional young teenager who doesn't really know what she exactly wants. Furthermore Angela apperas to be an exciting young woman who is funny and fascinating and attracted to older men like Lester.   I do mostly identify with Lester's character as I guess it's possible to feel the urge wanting to be younger by working out and trying to improve your own physique as one gets older and tries to be more attractive for a young woman. I do not support him consuming marijuana, but I do support the fact that he wants to try out something new that he maybe did not experience in his younger years. Besides I do not judge Lester for having a \\"crush\\" on Angela as his marriage is almost torn aparty anyway and his wife is only concerned about her business. Lester's attraction to Angela also implies realistic aspects that one can still feel attracted to somebody else even though this person is married.  Referring to which character I reject most, I choose Carolyn as she is a perfect example for what I declare as cold-hearted, insensitive, materialistic and only focused on business, not paying any attention to her family, instead of that even having an affair with a business partner and seriously cheating on her husband by breaking the promise of being true as she also has sex with him.  The director's intention in making this film was to create a picture, a situation about a middle-aged man's life and his family and what it can turn into if one is suffering from a midlife crisis. Even more the director maybe wanted to simply allegorize possible developments in different relationships, for example the relationship between Lester and his wife or Lester and Angela and things like cheating, a marriage falling apart or murder is not that \\"unusual\\" and \\"rare\\" as people always suppose it is. These incidents actually, they are the message the director wants to transport to the viewers. One message I could think of would be \\"you can never know what might happen to you\\" which refers to Lester as he fell in love with a very young woman or that his marriage could ever fall apart. Actually, it doesn't relate to many films I know as there is no other movie I know that has elements of drama, melodrama and comedy included. Of course, there are different films in which several relationships fall apart, but there is no film I know that is concentrated on the midlife crisis of a middle-aged man and his trials to turn younger.  It relates to US-American culture by showing a \\"pretty normal\\" life - at first - of an American family living in the suburbs and sharing a family life. But this film also relates to the American Pop Culture as the scenes in which red rose petals are all over Angela's body, are real and true art combined with the music creating a special atmosphere having in mind that these scenes are Lester's sexual fantasies. This film is not just a film that shows life referring to the US-American culture, it also does give the viewer a slight sense of US-American \\"art-culture\\" as there is no other film that is so specific and actually one-of-a-kind.  I think that this film is a masterpiece which maybe doesn't appear at a masterpiece at all at first sight. It is a little bit like love at \\"second sight\\". The plot is amusing, entertaining and also melodramatic because of the dramatic elements this film includes. One of the film's strengths is the directing, editing and camera as one can just take the wonderful example of Lester's sexual fantasies about Angela with all the red rose petals all over her body. Different camera shots and structures emphasize specific situations that are usually not that specific. Moreover the music is one of the film's biggest strenghts as it feels like the music was produced and the texts written in a combination while the plot was written, to me it seems like film and music have finally come to be one piece. I cannot see any weaknesses in this film at all.  I highly recommend this film as this film is a must-have-seen and those people who do not watch it are going to miss one of the biggest masterpieces in the filmhistory ever. This film is amusing, interesting, entertaining, exciting, sometimes even confusing, but all these characteristics make this film wonderful.  by B.B.    The movie American Beauty is about Lester, a family man, who has the desire to break out from the classified life. He has enough of the thankless life with a wife, who always wants to be perfect with no human feelings and a daughter who hates him.   Trying to do only what he thinks is fun without considering any sort of moral obligations, Lester manages to destroy the perfect family picture in the shortest time. Getting away from routine life, only doing what he wants to do, doing sports to be desirable again, smoking a joint because feeling like it, buying a Firebird because he's always wanted one, say things that he actually means because he doesn't have to adapt to anyone...just being twenty years younger.   The consequences of his midlife crisis causes unsalvageable damage but, even if too late, brings along important realization.   Their daughter Jane walks in the shadow of her confident friend Angela, whose perfect facade breaks together like a house of cards in the course of the movie through inexperience and vulnerability. There isn't a single boy who shows interest for Jane, unlike Angela. Behind heavy make-up, Jane tries to hide herself and thinks that by having her breasts enlarged she can fight off her the doubts about herself.   But it's the new neighbor boy who helps her find confidence in herself. Ricky is a voyeur and a criminal in one. He deals with drugs and one of his customers is Lester. He goes to the same school as Jane and he's the first boy who is interested in her. His father, Colonel Fitts, is a former soldier who tries to hide the fact that he likes men by having an aggressive opinion towards gay relationships.  The main character is without any doubt Lester. After breaking out of this role, Lester's zest for life returns a new because his seemingly perfect life is anything but in his new position, Lester awakens; he's confident and happy. Lester is the first to break out of this perfect life but it doesn't take long for the other characters to follow him and show their true faces.   Every protagonist is clearly and naturalistically drawn but it's Carolyn who carries the greatest responsibility and with it the heaviest burden. Her goal is always to be perfect. Through her own high pretenses she loses the natural ability to simply be human. Carolyn isn't able to show feelings in front of her daughter or her husband because showing any sort of emotions is a danger to the dominant and emotionless Carolyn. For her reputation in society and for her pursuit of material things she inhabits the role of the emotionless wife and mother but sadly she breaks out far too late.  I wouldn't turn down any of the protagonists in this movie because each role is only an end product of society's expectations.   I feel sorry for each character one way or the other, be it the inexperienced Angela who pretends to have sexual experiences or Colonel Fitts, who beats his son because he assumes his son is having an affair with Lester. Colonel Fitts, who's gay himself but suppresses his urges as best he can, wants to save his son from the humiliation. In a perfect society you simply cannot be gay.   Personal happiness, which makes life worth living, is being set behind the expectations of society. Therefore it is only a matter of time before the true personality dies.   Everything is only a facade, seemingly normal for the outside world but not necessarily reality. The American Dream, no matter which nationality, is the reason why millions of people emigrated/still emigrate to the USA. People who wanted to achieve a lot of popularity. But do expensive homes, gardens and cars make us happy? The higher the social class, the higher the expectations.  Is the daily trying to make the right society\\" decision not too stressful? The intact family, is it real? Is a human being able to step out of his role, to step off the stage and take off the make-up? Despite a few amusingparts in the movie, it's a movie that criticizes society. It's a movie without a happy end. Lester's insight comes far too late but no one blames him because he's only the victim. In movies such as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" the American is portrayed as the proud, honorable person who's willing to die for his country. All this is shown as a facade in this movie. The movie is most definitely convincing. The camera angle as well as the lights and sound effects were especially configured for each scene making them so much more believable.   Through camera angles such as \\"medium shot\\", the audience has the feeling of being there in person. The protagonist doesn't have to talk for the audience to know what he's feeling, it seems so real. The \\"eye level shot\\" camera angle for example, the audience can watch through the perspective of a certain character, which supports the audience compassion. The music becomes louder and faster the more their lives break apart and the light fits into each emotional state of the main characters. The reason the story is so good is because it's different. Even though it might seem unrealistic at first glance, something like this could happen anywhere because society's pressure is everywhere and everyone goes through a midlife crisis at least once in his live.   I would recommend this movie to everyone who's fed up with American movies that portray America to be perfect. On top of everything, the superb cast is a plus as well, added to the great script. Have fun watching!  Z.Z.    American Beauty is directed by S. Mendes and was a coming out in 2000. The film deals with an American middle-class family tragedy which is played by the main character Lester, his wife Carolyn Burnham and their daughter Jane. At the beginning it seems to that they achieve the American dream but everything turns into a nightmare.  The Burnhams are living in a suburban city and Carolyn is employed as a real estate agent and Lester is working for a media company and their daughter Jane is attending the high school.  To begin with, at the begining Lester Burnham is shown as a boring and ordinary employee until he gets a midlife crisis. All the desaster starts by seeing Jane's best friend Angela. Suddenly he feels like a teenage boy and he knows that his life is so unfulfilled and he wants to become a new and strong man to make Angela fall in love with him. Lester gets a new meaning of life, he tries to be attractive to Angela , he increasingly sees the complete life in a rather simple way, he finds a new job without responsibilty at a fast food restaurant and he buys a new car, all in all, it seems that he loses all of the old\\" life and he behaves like a teenager.Furthermore, he knows that his wife Carolyn is unfaithful and betrays him with an other men, but Lester shows no interest in it. Carolyn is represented like an ordinary and bustling woman, who is eager to be sucessful. Also she is proud of their way of living, all the material things in their life make her happy, but she is unhappy in her marriage, too. Thus she cheats Lester. Carolyn means that she has reached all aims in her life, she has one child, a beautiful house and a well-paid job, but in the ending she realizes that she hasn`t established anything in her life. On the contrary Carolyn has recognized that she probably waseted her time by getting married to Lester.  Jane is an American teenage girl who doesn't want to be beautiful, conceited and ordinary like her parents so she dresses herself dark and unpretty. But what is so paradox about her attitude being not marvellous is that she plays with her thought getting a breast surgery what is probably just a teenage complex. Also Jane is fighting with her dad because her father has a crush on Angela and Jane totally feels ashamed for her dad that he is able to act like that, in case of it their relationship isn`t a regular father-daughter thing. Ricky is Jane's neightbour and also her school mate who caughts her on hisvideo cam which is the reason that that she calls him a \\"pervert\\" and for a while it was pretty quiet around him but after Jane is recognizing that Ricky is watching and being interested in her she kind of feels attracted to him: Jane gives up the typical yuppie life for the \\"true love\\" for Ricky.  Ricky is in a way comparable to Jane because he isn`t the most handsome guy around the neighbourhood and probably doesn`t fulfill the typical American way of beauty also he lives a very secluded life. The reason for his behaviour is supposedly has his mother has a mental issue and lives pretty pulled back but in the contrast to Ricky`s dad who is a tyrant probably because he suspects that Ricky is dealing with drugs which would be totally against his way of military thinking and the American moral.  by K.K. and N.S.
0143118420|1.0|I purchased this book (after hearing from a few members of my book club that it was inspiring and wonderful) with an open mind and expecting something that I could apply to my own life. I regret to say that it was boring, uneventful and a complete waste of money. Every book is not for everyone and this one was not for me. I have been reading since I was four and I LOVE to read; this book is the first book that I have not been able to finish. I could not relate to anything that she did/went through to find herself. Just my opinion but this book was not for me.
B002RWKSII|5.0|When this Wilson-Gershwin project was announced I have to admit I knew little or nothing about Gershwin.....  After a bit of research I knew a bit more about the Gershwin brothers but was left with the nagging feeling that Brian may just not be able to pull this one off.  SMiLE had been a major achievement for Brian in more ways than one, 'That Lucky Old Sun' was really good as an album of new material - exceeded my expectations by a long-shot!  Still 'reimagining' Gershiwn?  I needn't have worried. After a few listens I found myself singing along, enjoying the music,Brian's excellent vocals and, as ever, his band in great vocal and musical form.  I already know what Brian's fans think of it but would love to know what Gershwin fans think of it?   Five Stars for this one,  Thank you Brian!
0765356139|3.0|After being pleasantly surprised at the quality of the first book in the series, 'Mistborn (The Final Empire)', I was looking forward to continuing the story of Vin and company. Unfortunately, I felt the book left a lot to be desired, but does provide a good set-up for 'Hero of Ages.'<br /><br />The plot picks up shortly after the last one left off, with Elend the newly-crowned king of Luthadel, who's unsure of himself and still struggling with his new-found responsibilities, all while having to deal with three separate armies who have the city under siege. A large portion of the novel deals with Elend and Vin's relationship during this period, and unfortunately this type of thing does not seem to be Mr. Sanderson's strong suit, and the reader ends up just feeling frustrated at times. Also, while Elend is decent as a main protagonist, he's nowhere near as interesting or dynamic as Kelsier, but he does eventually grow into his own, somewhat. Many of the other members of Kelsier's old crew, such as Breeze, are pushed into the background for this one. Even Vin's role is reduced quite a bit, which is quite a change from the first novel. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just gives the book a different feel overall.<br /><br />'Well of Ascension,' unfortunately, suffers from the same problem as many other middle books of trilogies. The author has the tough task of trying to maintain the interest level even after the novelty or 'newness' of the first one has worn off, plus try to set up the final novel while still having a climax in this one. To me, the book felt like TOO much set-up. The pace does pick up toward the end, but having to wade through the nearly 700-pages to get there was at times a bit of a slog, but definitely leaves you with the desire to start 'Hero of Ages' right away and, at least in that respect, I think the novel succeeds. If the last one's anywhere near as interesting and just plain fun as the first, then it all will have been worth it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Been a Daria fan ever since it came out on MTV. Its just nice to have all the episodes in a complete set. I find all the characters very funny in their own ways. Weather its Daria with her dark humor, or her father being so stupid funny. Will definetly enjoy them for years to come.
0061353248|2.0|This is an intellectually lazy book that buries a few mildly interesing studies under endless anecdotes, opinion and speculation.  He gives very little detail of the studies (e.g. number of participants, mean vs median results) so it's hard to determine if the results he has are statistically significant or their precise meaning.  For example, when given an opportunity to cheat, the average score of a group of students goes up - it would have been good to know if this was the result of one or two students cheating a lot or most of the students cheating a little (his opinion).   Many of the studies' results could have other equally reasonable explanations and, rather than explore each of them, the author simply picks the explanation that fits with his rather tranparent social and political views.  For example, he cites a study where his students who he asked to pay to listen to him read poetry offered to pay him when he asked again whereas when he offered to pay students to listen to his poerty they wanted to be paid to listen again.  He attributes this to subconcious anchoring but another explanation is these students are conciously attempting to meet what they think their teacher's expectations are.    His thought process is also sloppy,  Because humans are not entirely rational in determining their needs he concludes that the free market cannot be trusted and therefore the government must play a significant regulatory role.  He cites the water and electricity industries as examples which seems silly - the need for regulation in these industries is because they are natural monopolies of an essential service, not because people are too irrational to decide how much electricity they need.     The author is also astonishly full of himself - he belives he's discovered the proper way for a group to order dinner, for companies to offer credit cards, how to lose weight, how to control lobbyists or how to solve the subprime mortgage problem.  Each of his proposals raises anumber of obvious questions which he makes no effort to present or answer.  He suffers from an arrogance common to university professors who think they can run the world better based on studies that ask 18 year old volunteers to answer questions for a dime apiece.

B002ZG983M|5.0|First off, I would have to say this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. It was pure awesomeness. It had a lot of action and humorous parts. The acting was also great and it had an interesting storyline. Now all of those people out there who are saying that this was such a horrible movie and that it's not a family movie and such. Well, I just have to say a couple things. First, it is rated R. Right there should be enough for most parents to not let their children watch this movie. Second, if you let your kids watch some R rated movies based on their content, you can look right on the back of the dvd case or on the internet and it tells you right there why it's rated R. And I believe it says on the back of this case that this movie is rated R because it has brutal violence throughout, pervasive language, sexual content, nudity, and drug use - some involving children. As I have said, that is as it says exactly on the back of this movie's case. Right there should send up a red flag that this movie is not for kids. If you let your kids watch movies without even knowing why they are rated what they are, then you are just asking for your children to see things that they are not ready to see or hear stuff you don't want them to. So don't blame the movie, blame yourself.<br /><br />Over all, this was a very good movie - for adults. And if you give this movie a bad rating because its not a family friendly movie, just look on the back of the case and you will see that it was never intended for family audiences in the first place.

0446618322|5.0|WOW!! This book is EXCELLENT! It had me cryin, in suspense, angry, happy, shocked etc... You name it. This is the 2nd book I've read by Mr. Sparks and I have to say again, WOW. This one is a gripping one about faith, love, hope, redemption, & forgiveness. The journey that U.S Marine Logan Thibault takes you on is just incredible. I cannot say more about this one without giving it away, but please trust me, you have to read this book. I highly recommend this read.
0399156577|3.0|I had to make myself finish the book over the course of 2 weeks! I wasn't feeling the chemistry between the characters until the very end and didn't really care whether they made it as a couple or not. There was so much build up for a quick wrap up, unexciting ending. I cannot believe the lack of \\"show-down\\" that occurred. I feel like I missed a chapter or two somewhere. Overall I just didn't care for it and am glad I borrowed it from a friend rather than spending almost $30 on it! If you're set on reading it I'd opt for the library.
0920668372|5.0|People who think this book is \\"creepy\\" are thinking about it too hard. Yes, in REAL LIFE, a mother driving to her son's house and climbing up a ladder and through his window is stalker-ish. But this is a CHILDREN's book and it's supposed to be slightly exaggerated and silly. Over the top? maybe... but there's a reason for it. It's exaggerated so even young children can understand it. If anything, it's funny, not creepy.     Anyway, I remember reading this book when I was younger and loving it. I read it again today and I cried. It's a great book. (:

B00000E7Q6|4.0|Black Tie white Noise is not the usual from Bowie but it has his distinct original flair to it. He enters the Acid Jazz genre and mixes it with the modern urban R/B soul sound. He brings back old songs like a I feel free by Cream and adds an interesting mix of Saxaphone and eclectic styles. Jump they Say is a song based loosely on Bowies brother and is not quite what you'd expect from David Bowie but than again this album isnt what you'd expect from Bowie. Black Tie white Noise track is has an urban feel to it, while Dont let me down & down is a nice slow ballad which harkens back to his mid 80's album Never Let Me down (86). It was not a huge commercial success when released nor does it has the brilliance of later albums like Outside but it is an interesting entry into the bizarre and eclectic discography of David Bowie. Bowie is always interesting to hear hes one of the few old artists that constantly surprises us.
1451532512|2.0|It is a great copy of the book in the sense that it's inexpensive and it's not bulky at all and it's great if you are reading for entertainment. The problem being is that THERE IS NO LINE NUMBERS! I bought this copy to use for school, and it is impossible to keep up with the teacher mainly because there is no line numbers at all! Also, a lesser issue is that no where on the page does it tell you what Act/Scene it is. So if you're looking for a copy to use at home for \\"fun\\" reading this is it. But if you want to use it in any class, DON'T NOT BUY THIS COPY.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|Jacob's fake mother was right.    On Sunday, May 23rd, Two-Thousand and Ten, we all went down to the light and experienced something much worse than dying.    This ending of LOST.    But before I continue with this denunciation of the denouement of LOST, let me be clear: If I punch you in the face and you tell me you didn't like that, can I defend myself and say \\"You just don't get it, man!\\"    What I'm saying is, I think you can understand the ending of LOST very well and legitimately hate it.    UNREALITY USUALLY DOES FEEL UNREAL    The Island was Purgatory.    Don't misunderstand me. I believe that the survivors of Oceanic 815 DO survive the plane crash that occurs in the pilot episode. What the Island does is function as the true Purgatory. The \\"real\\" Purgatory, the one of Season Six, has no actual restorative or redemptive point, both in contrast (addressed later) and because this Purgatory, unlike The Island, doesn't exist.    That unreality is a big problem - because, in the same way that the accomplishments of your dreams feel cheap when you wake, it's hard to believe there's true redemption for a character when their actions occur in a dream world. Especially when that idea is unsupported, which I'll also address shortly.    This is why many were concerned that The Island was a mystical limbo and the Survivors didn`t actually survive, because it would invalidate 6 years of watching this fantastic show. It's the dreaded \\"it was all a dream\\" ending. Instead, only half of Season Six is mystical limbo and is invalidated, because when Jack is a good father to a son that doesn't exist and Sawyer chooses Law and Order as his path to avenge his parents in a dream, that ISN'T redemption. And I think why this is, is because the show itself is not real, but we suspend that disbelief. But to create another layer of unreality, call it a \\"dream world\\" or \\"limbo\\" or \\"whatever\\", this is too much, and they cancel each other out. Especially, again, when this idea is unsupported in the show.    EVEN THE BEST IDEAS NEED TO BE LET GO OF IF THEY NO LONGER FIT    Time travel, though bizarre and often unexplained, doesn't bother me because it had been setup in the show and explored. The Island exists in a different space/time, so maybe the characters can too. Fine. But the idea of the characters creating a world for themselves in the afterlife comes out of no where - like getting a greeting card in the mail for a holiday that doesn't exist. I don't think you can spend 6 years on a TV show and in the last few minutes throw in a totally unsupported idea.    The End, in the end, fails in part because unlike \\"Pans Labyrinth\\" and \\"American Beauty,\\" the idea of a mystical world created by the love these people had for each other was never supported. It's too big and vague and dreamy to just throw into the air and expect people to accept it without any legs.    The other part of it's failure is that it feels tacked on. From what I understand, the ending has been known all along, and maybe as an idea it's clever and beautiful, but I think that the show had out grown and moved on to a different ending. But instead of recognizing this, the writers who agreed with this end forced an old idea into a puzzle it no longer fit in.    WATERED DOWN WATER    If the point of the \\"sideways world\\" was to realize how important everyone was to each other, I would say that's a joke. Jin/Sun, Claire/Charlie, Kate/Jack, they all figured that out in the previous world, The Island. If the point was to let go of your past, again, that was the point of The Island. Where you could be anyone and start over. If the point was to come to be at peace with your own death, Rose invalidates it. Charlies acceptance of his fate invalidates it. They already had that peace. All that happens in the \\"sideways world\\" was the characters remembered their past time on the island, and for that, they are now ready? There were no great realizations, no new connections made. In short, it had noreal function. It was just a collection of \\"clip show\\" moments, where the characters could come back together and say \\"Hey, I know you.\\"    It was on The Island that Jack, Locke, Charlie, Claire, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley and the rest of our beloved Survivors let go of their past. That's where they realized how important they were to each other; where they loved and KNEW they loved each other. Here is where they redeemed themselves from a pointless, empty life.    An argument being made is that it functioned as a place where Jack could finally let go. I would counter that he already let go. Jack dies on The Island with a smile, knowing he fulfilled his purpose; that he saved his friends and The Island, if not the world. What did he do in The End? He came to terms with his death when he opened up an empty casket? He already came to terms with his death. Jack knew he was dead when he made the decision to go and replace the cork. Jack already let go; by giving into his fate, to protect The Island, and by giving control of the Island over to Hurley.    This is why The End is so unbearable, because we already saw redemption. We already saw the realization of how important they all were to each other, so to see it again and in such a cheap, superficial way is heart breaking.    This second Purgatory functions only in the way that the waters in Dante's Purgatory do. The River Eunoe gives back to its imbibers their good memories. And this is the ending to LOST? A cliff notes version of something everyone - the writers, the characters, and the viewers - already knew deep in their soul? That they mattered to each other? This is The End?    AND THE WORST PART IS ..    This is the first time I've felt hate toward this show and now it's gone. This is Jack and Christian Shepard all over again, ending on a angry note, but here there won't be another episode of LOST to come around to redeem it. I won't touch the casket of Season Six and feel peace.    What this ending does is make me feel tricked. That things like the flash on the screen and the corresponding time shift for Jack, Kate, and Sawyer from the Season Five finale (indicting Jughead went off); these were nothing but coins an adult would seemingly pull from my ear when I was a kid. Being cute with editing tricks.    MY OWN PRIVATE \\"\\"END\\"    How did I want LOST to end?    I never cared about being told all of the answers: Where this statue came from? Why Walt was so important? They weren't things I was concerned about. What I cared for was that LOST would end in a way where I was surprised and happy. That's all (though a lot). The way I felt when Charlie died, or when I learned that Jack, when he's waiting at the edge of the airport, that that was the future and he is demanding they go BACK to the Island! Joy! Surprised! These are the feelings I wanted, or even needed, for this shows last minutes but where were they?    Instead, here we are 4 days later, and I'm still left with my hands in a confused, swearing pose. The same reaction I have to watching every other stupid TV show, and that's what was so special about LOST. It wasn't every other stupid show.    I was going to write out how I would have ended the show, but it doesn't matter. This is how it ended. This is how it always will end: \\"What's done is done\\".    But I will ask why the meeting place was a church and not an airport?    An airport is a better symbol of the faith they had in each other, because THAT is relevant to this show. A church is just a building in the world of LOST, and that's all it is here. A superficial symbol of the faith and the after life.  Much like Season Six was, just a superficial version of the previous years.

Amanda Seyfried is good as well, she shows surprising depth as the title character, her huge eyes tell quite a story I must say. I really enjoyed this film until the cheesy ending, very disappointed by that. Overall, Chloe is a very sexy and almost solid flick.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|I loved this film when I saw it in the theatre, and knew I would buy it when it came to DVD, as it has an intricate plot that would measure up to multiple viewings.  I was very surprised to find that the featurettes (only 2, and those are the only extras?) were only available on the Blu-Ray edition!!  This is really ridiculous, in my opinion, and unkind to the people purchasing the movie on standard DVD - why shouldn't we get the extras, too?!?  This is not enough to affect my rating of the movie, but a cautionary tale to people \\"only\\" buying the standard DVD - is this the future of marketing new DVDs?  If so, I think it stinks...

1433502453|5.0|There is no other study bible out there compared to the ESV! The ESV is a great resource to believers. If you're truly wanting to grow in relationship to Christ, get this bible. The notes and articles in it are a great study resource to have. Granted, this bible is very thick. You're probably not going to carry it to a worship experience at church, but it's a phenomenal resource to have. Plus, when you purchase the ESV Study Bible you get access to the online version which is also a great tool! I highly recommend this bible.
0061122416|5.0|I've read this book several times and each time, something new is revealed - always through the simplicity.    As others have said, the writing is simple and clear, as a primer - but don't confuse that as being writing for young readers. The reality expressed in the simplicity is this: the only place you need to look for the truth is in yourself. The only search would be one's own personal journey.    It's just that simple.  And profound.
0375703764|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough for ... well, anyone who likes to read. It truly is progressive fiction at its finest.    The level of craftsmanship and depth that is put into the characters, plot, and narration is nothing short of masterful. My second read-through was more enjoyable than my first, and I'm sure my third will follow suit.    WARNING: You'll never be satisfied by traditional fiction again. Read at your own risk.

076790592X|5.0|The author of this book does a nice job of realying what the dying professor wants people in our country to hear before he passes on. For me the best message Professor Schwartz delivers is in these words that are so applicable to the problems our country is facing and our leaders just don't get it: He said, \\"We don't see what we could be.\\" The prof goes on to relay the message that we are lacking compassion for one another and he got that right, didn't he?

030726999X|5.0|An absolutely incredible ending to the \\"Millennium Trilogy.\\"  All three of Larsson's books are exceptionally well-written, with magnificent plots, excitement, and (most importantly, character development).  Lisbeth Salander's final denouement is so tension-filled that it is virtually impossible to put the book down for a second.  Having read all three of the books -- and having seen the first two Swedish versions of the movies -- I must say that I enjoyed this book more than any of the other facets of the \\"trilogy,\\" but that is simply a statement of how superb this novel truly is.  In point of fact, I would say this is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read (and I am a prolific reader).<br /><br />Insofar as the delivery of the book itself is concerned, it was sent to me by Amazon in just three days (and I live in Hawaii, so am accustomed to absurdly-lengthy delays of shipments of merchandise I order online from other companies).  Amazon's dependability and responsiveness represent a manifestation of precisely why that organization is at the top of so many persons' list of \\"favorite Web companies\\" (and it is assuredly at the very summit of mine!).  Amazon is, quite simply and succinctly, THE VERY BEST.
1591841666|5.0|Seth Grodin's \\"The Dip\\" focuses on the dry patches that emerge when one is pursuing a valuable and meaningful objective. All super successful people from Richard Branson to Blessed Mother Teresa have faced the Dip and how they embraced it separated them from all other mortals.

(But actually it is a shortcut because it gets you were you are going faster than any other path.)<br />* The difference between the easy \\"beginner\\" and the expert.<br />* The long stretch between beginner's luck and real accomplishment.<br />* The set of artificial screens set up to KEEP YOU OUT.<br /><br />Life offers us an infinite number of life choices and once a choice has been made, there is excitement and hope then \\"The Dip.\\" Scott Peck, MD, in his \\"The Road Less Traveled,\\" addressed the dip in romantic relationships as one moves from the romantic to day-to-day living. The latter is less a feeling and more a decision, a commitment. This is equally true for careers, projects, exercise and diet, raising a family, and much more.<br /><br />\\"Almost everything important in life is controlled by The Dip.\\" It is the reason we are here and it is the obstacle that trips up most. Grodin's \\"The Dip\\" is a quick, insightful read that provides an in-depth look at the \\"The Dip\\" and how successful, the superstars of life, navigate it as this is where success happens.
0743298039|5.0|So, I picked this book up at Borders, just looking around for a couple of good books to read this summer to stow away and finally pulled it off my shelf to read.  I started this quaint story about a gal who loves books, la, la, la, and then, Shazam, the story pops off the page.  Seems this \\"bookish\\" gal has a bit of intriguing family history.  What's more, she's hired by a famous author to write a biography.  The famous author wants to finally reveal the truth about her life before she passes on.<br /><br />By visiting and working alongside Vida Winter, famous author, our narrator, Margaret Lea, figures out a thing or two about her own life.  Vita's story is amazing, full of twists and turns and surprises, a masterpiece of literary creativity.  Margaret's careful handling of Vita's story and her own understanding and acceptance of her family and her history is inspiring.  This is truly a book that was a welcome surprise and definitely hard to put down.

B0013N7AD8|5.0|From the reviews and from what I have seen on other bluray transfers, this is the best one yet.

They are so terrible)....
0061714372|5.0|I loved this book. It's entertaining, edited well, doesn't bore you to death with trivial details. It was nice to read Dave Mustaine's side of the story, with regards to Metallica, as well as the rest of his career. This book is surprisingly funny. My favorite part is where you describes his choice, as a Christian, not to share a venue with a band called \\"Rotting Christ\\". Apparently the singer spent time in prison as an accessory to murder and said that Dave was now his \\"sworn enemy\\". I guess being an avowed satanist makes you the sworn enemy of any Christian. For this people called him a \\"prude\\". Only in metal...read this book!
B003J27WFW|5.0|I DVRed this off Palladia a little while ago and finally got to watch it last night. Not really sure what to say about it other than it is an amazing, amazing, amazing film that surpassed my expectations. The old footage the filmmakers have dug up on these guys is by itself enough for me to give the film my highest recommmendation. One particularly notable example is footage of guitarist Alex Lifeson at a very young age (18? 19?) debating the pros and cons of a career as a professional musician with his parents at the dinnner table. Where did they get this? More interesting, who was sitting at Lifeson's family's dinner table documenting this (in color and sound, no less), way before Rush was famous? This is but one of the many joys to be had for the Rush fan in BEYOND THE LIGHTED STAGE, which I will not ennumerate, but instead simply say that if you have been a fan of this band at any point in your life, you need to see this film. It's hard to predict these things with any kind of certainty, but I'm pretty sure that in time this film will be listed with the likes of [[ASIN:B001NHZ2KM The Kids Are Alright (Deluxe Edition)]] and LET IT BE as one of the all-time great rock documentaries.
B0034G4OWM|5.0|It's a great silly family film. My husband and I enjoyed hearing our boys laugh: their exaggerated laughter over some of the corny jokes made us laugh, too. It's a simple movie to sit back, relax and enjoy being a family.  The film gives little reminders on how important it is to keep your family as your number 1 priority. It also reminds us to have kindness and compassion to animals and to save our forests. Any movie that sends those kinds of messages gets five stars from us. You'll have one night of silly family laughter with Fury Vengeance.  Just laugh with your kids.

0061537969|3.0|As a dog lover I was drawn to this book by it's cover and by the reviews it had received on Amazon. However, I wasn't that impressed by the author's writing style. It was very basic and simple.     While I shed many tears reading this book(which I attribute that to my natural teariness at anything heartfelt), the dialogue and descriptions didn't tug at my heart to the depth as some other classic novels have.     It's an ok and easy read book - though I wouldn't necessary recommend it to a friend nor would I want to keep this book in my own personal library.
0375842209|4.0|I found The Book Thief to be both unsettling and compelling. The book far overreaches its target audience of young adults. Unique in concept and execution, the book heightened by respect for books and the power that words have over us.<br /><br />Told from the persepective of German children during WWII, the narrator (Death) draws us in to the ravages of war (from both sides) and its effects on the lives of children.<br /><br />Zusak writes many compelling scenes, but I was most struck by Liesel reading in the bomb shelter as one-by-one, the adults begin to listen to her. Words have power to hurt, to calm, to raise us above. The author certainly used them to move this reader.<br /><br />I found the intrusion of Death, the narrator to be irritating, but I realized that was the point the author was making. If I allowed my adolescent daughter to read this novel, I would read it with her.<br /><br />I appreciated the cover and layout, but whose idea was it to font the page numbers so that they could not be read?<br />Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont

B002SJIO5E|4.0|District 9 is an interesting account of ghetto aliens, trying to survive on a hostile planet following the breakdown of their spaceship.  The lead character, a human, is our hero, if a bit selfish, and unable to see a larger picture.  It's a good yarn, and I hope a sequel is made to help fix all the bad things that happened.
B002ZCZYSY|5.0|UNO H2O is a fun stimulating game for all ages!  The cards are durable,waterproof, easy to read and colorful.

I would definatley suggest getting more than one!Enjoy!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|The only difference between the DVDs and the Daria I grew up with is that some of the music was altered. Though the concept itself was annoying I barely noticed the changes since most of the time the music was only background and not important to the plot and when it was important to what the characters were saying it remained the same as before. The show still makes me laugh and when I watched it witch a first time viewer it was even better because their reactions and laughter were priceless and made me enjoy it all the more.

The book is inspiring...and not in that \\"self-help\\" sickening way. Her colorful descriptions of the places she visits just jump off of the page and into your mind leaving you with no choice but to start saving your pennies for a next trip over seas. She will inspire you to begin your own journey of self-discovery and to drop the projected social expectations some of us lose ours identities to. I'm sorry I put off this read for so long!

0143038419|4.0|I had a hard time reading the book, tried several times and just couldn't get past all the self-inflicted drama in the beginning.  That said, once I got past the opening chapters, I really enjoyed Italy (Eat), and especially loved India (Pray).  I like Bali (Love), too, just felt like the end was not as fully developed as the rest of the story had been - seemed like the author just ran out of energy.

0525423842|1.0|Eighth-grader Theo Boone is a courtroom junkie.  Both of his parents are lawyers, and Theo knows that eventually, he wants to work with the law -- he just doesn't know if he wants to be a lawyer or a judge.  Until then, he has to content himself with attending as many trials as possible, giving legal advice to his classmates and giving guest lectures in his Government class.<br /><br />Now, though, there's been a murder in wholesome Strattenburg, and due to a lack of evidence, the murderer is going to walk -- unless Theo Boone is able to find a way to protect the identity of a secret witness AND use said witness' testimony.<br /><br />And there you have it:  Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer.<br /><br />So.<br /><br />As you've probably already predicted, I want to punch this book in the face.<br /><br />It didn't help that I had an attitude from minute one.  The Bestselling Author Breaking Into The YA/J Market trend has been annoying from the first, and the TITLE is just... awful.  But.  I was willing to give both of those things a pass, because sometimes Bad Titles obscure Good Books, and sometimes Big Name Adult Authors do make a smooth transition into the YA/J world.  And sometimes we even end up happy that they decided to wander over.<br /><br />This time?  Not so much.<br /><br />The back cover promises \\"high intensity legal drama\\".  Of those four words, only one is accurate:  legal.  There is very definitely no high intensity, and certainly no drama¹.  Unless we're using drama as the opposite of comedy, in which case, I guess we could call it drama.  A Lesson on the Ins and Outs of the Legal System would have been a more accurate description, but that's not going to get loads of people to snap a book up, regardless of age.<br /><br />Readers who have become accustomed to middle grade crime fighters who are comfortable Taking Action (like our much-beloved Sammy Keyes) might be taken aback by the lack of actual Action on Theo's part -- the information pretty much falls into his lap and SPOILER Theo ultimately puts it all in the hands of the grown-ups, which is the most realistic solution, but leaves quite a lot to be desired, excitement-wise END SPOILER.<br /><br />Theo Boone might work for readers who love Encyclopedia Brown but who are ready for something a bit longer -- though, if I'm remembering correctly (and I should be, considering I read them each 80 bazillion times), the Encyclopedia Brown books featured both more drama, more independent action from main character AND more trust in his own abilities from himself as well as from adults.<br /><br />My issues:<br /><br />Page 7:<br /><br />\\"It wasn't a romance; they were too young for that.  Theo did not know of a single thirteen-year-old boy in his class who admitted to having a girlfriend.  Just the opposite.  They wanted nothing to do with them.  And the girls felt the same way.  Theo had been warned that things would change, and dramatically, but that seemed unlikely.\\"<br /><br />I don't know what eighth graders John Grisham has been hanging around, but they clearly aren't from this planet.  Also, it seemed like he was going for the Olde Fashionedy Children's Book Omniscient Storyteller voice, but it came across, to me, as irritating, condescending and inconsistent.  Not to mention really fond of Telling, rather than Showing.<br /><br />The irritating shows up throughout, but here's an example of the condescending nature of the voice.  On page 19, about Theo's Government teacher:  \\"He always addressed them as \\"men\\" and for thirteen-year-olds there was no greater compliment.\\"  Just... STOP IT.  If there is no greater compliment -- WHICH I HIGHLY DOUBT -- than any thirteen-year-old reading it will already know that, and therefore, John Grisham, you don't have to spell it out for him.  In addition to the condescending narrator, the adult characters tend towards Condescending Assiness as well, though I'm sure that an argument could be made for realism there.<br /><br />The inconsistency also shows up throughout.  The example that lines up with the Disinterest in Girls shows up a bit later:<br /><br />Page 142:<br /><br />\\"Hallie was distraught, in tears, and Theo couldn't help but notice how cute she was even when she was crying.  It was a big moment for Theo.\\"<br /><br />Page 153:<br /><br />\\"\\"Why don't you call me sometime?\\" she asked.<br /><br />Why? Now that was a good question.  Probably because she was too busy talking to all the other boys.  She changed boyfriends every other month.  He'd never even thought of calling her.<br /><br />\\"I'll do that,\\" he said.  Be he knew he wouldn't.  He wasn't exactly looking for a girlfriend, and besides, April would be devastated if he began chasing a flirt like Hallie.\\"<br /><br />The narrator Tells the reader that Theo doesn't like girls, but then Theo's Behavior doesn't reflect that.  Now, the bit on page 142 could just be a clumsy attempt at character development -- that's how I read the \\"It was a big moment for Theo\\", at any rate.<br /><br />IF NOT FOR, AND ALSO, BUT.<br /><br />The passage from page 153?  About Hallie \\"changing boyfriends every month\\"?  What's that all about?  WHO ARE ALL OF THESE BOYFRIENDS, IF NONE OF THE BOYS ARE INTERESTED IN GIRLS?  AND HOW OBNOXIOUSLY OLDE FASHIONEDY GRANDFATHERY² IS THE \\"A FLIRT LIKE HALLIE\\" line?  What is this, the freaking 1920s?  ALSO, IF NO ONE IS INTERESTED IN ROMANCE, WHY WOULD APRIL BE DEVASTATED?<br /><br />I get what he was going for with the Theo/April relationship, I really do.  But it wasn't consistent with what the narrator Told me.  And so it added to the sloppy vibe.<br /><br />Anyway, a similar issue arises in regards to Theo's relationship with his uncle.  The narrator Informs us that Theo actively dislikes his uncle.  And then there is nothing in their interaction that really backs that assertion up -- there are moments of irritation, sure, but nothing that supported the level of Theo's supposed negative feeling.  AND, when Theo's got a problem, where does he go?  Straight to his uncle.  THAT.  MAKES.  NO.  SENSE.<br /><br />There was nothing in this book that suggested that we were dealing with an unreliable narrator, or even a sly one who'd say one thing while meaning the opposite -- so I was left feeling that the author just wasn't paying attention to what he was writing.  Or that he assumed his audience wouldn't notice the ridiculousity of what he was throwing at them.<br /><br />The story takes place in Strattenburg, a small city that I couldn't help but picture as Salem, the setting from Days of Our Lives -- because strangely, it's small enough that everyone seems to know each other, small enough that Theo smiles at AND IDENTIFIES every single person he sees on the way to the courthouse, but big enough to house a large courthouse, a pretty serious golf course and multiple gated communities, a large homeless population and a large population of illegal immigrants.  It felt bizarrely like an idyllic childhood hometown that grew into a small city due to plot requirements.<br /><br />Lastly -- and due to the fact that I dogeared almost EVERY SINGLE PAGE as an Annoyance Remembrance Aid, I could go on ad nauseum, but my lunchbreak is almost over and I really need to wind this up -- this last bit from pages 25-6 made me want to bang my head into a wall:<br /><br />\\"It was a bright class in a strong public school.  Justin was by far the best athlete, though he couldn't swim as fast as Brian.  Ricardo beat them all at golf and tennis.  Edward played the cello, Woody the electric guitar, Darren the drums, Jarvis the trumpet,  Joey had the highest IQ and made perfect grades.  Chase was the mad scientist who was always a threat to blow up the lab.  Aaron spoke Spanish, from his mother's side, German from his father's, and English, of course.  Brandon had an early morning paper route, traded stocks online, and planned to be the first millionaire in the group.<br /><br />Naturally, there were two hopeless nerds and at least one potential felon.<br /><br />The class even had its own lawyer, a first for Mr. Mount.\\"<br /><br />Now, granted, this is probably a personal issue rather than a true literary issue, BUT.  Was the nerd thing REALLY necessary?  It just seems... mean-spirited.  And kind of ridiculous, considering the fact that Theo, Mr. Mount's \\"star\\", always has his trusty laser pointer with him in case he's called on to give an impromptu lecture to the class: \\"Mr. Mount was known to be a bit slack with his class preparations on Fridays, and he needed Theo to fill in the gaps\\" (175).  If THAT doesn't scream 'nerd' to most eighth grade boys, well... I guess I've lost touch.<br /><br />Which is certainly possible.<br /><br />But there seemed to be quite a lot of vaguely mean-spirited-ness towards any character who was, I dunno, outside of the wholesome white bread mainstream.  (OTHER than the homeless kids who Theo tutors in English and their SPOILER illegal immigrant secret witness golf course employee cousin END SPOILER.)

I'm just sayin'.o's got a problem, where does he go?  Straight to his uncle.  THAT.  MAKES.  NO.  SENSE.<br /><br />There was nothing in this book that suggested that we were dealing with an unreliable narrator, or even a sly one who'd say one thing while meaning the opposite -- so I was left feeling that the author just wasn't paying attention to what he was writing.  Or that he assumed his audience wouldn't notice the ridiculousity of what he was throwing at them.<br /><br />The story takes place in Strattenburg, a small city that I couldn't help but picture as Salem, the setting from Days of Our Lives -- because strangely, it's small enough that everyone seems to know each other, small enough that Theo smiles at AND IDENTIFIES every single person he sees on the way to the courthouse, but big enough to house a large courthouse, a pretty serious golf course and multiple gated communities, a large homeless population and a large population of illegal immigrants.  It felt bizarrely like an idyllic childhood hometown that grew into a small city due to plot requirements.<br /><br />Lastly -- and due to the fact that I dogeared almost EVERY SINGLE PAGE as an Annoyance Remembrance Aid, I could go on ad nauseum, but my lunchbreak is almost over and I really need to wind this up -- this last bit from pages 25-6 made me want to bang my head into a wall:<br /><br />\\"It was a bright class in a strong public school.  Justin was by far the best athlete, though he couldn't swim as fast as Brian.  Ricardo beat them all at golf and tennis.  Edward played the cello, Woody the electric guitar, Darren the drums, Jarvis the trumpet,  Joey had the highest IQ and made perfect grades.  Chase was the mad scientist who was always a threat to blow up the lab.  Aaron spoke Spanish, from his mother's side, German from his father's, and English, of course.  Brandon had an early morning paper route, traded stocks online, and planned to be the first millionaire in the group.<br /><br />Naturally, there were twohopeless nerds and at least one potential felon.<br /><br />The class even had its own lawyer, a first for Mr. Mount.\\"<br /><br />Now, granted, this is probably a personal issue rather than a true literary issue, BUT.  Was the nerd thing REALLY necessary?  It just seems... mean-spirited.  And kind of ridiculous, considering the fact that Theo, Mr. Mount's \\"star\\", always has his trusty laser pointer with him in case he's called on to give an impromptu lecture to the class: \\"Mr. Mount was known to be a bit slack with his class preparations on Fridays, and he needed Theo to fill in the gaps\\" (175).  If THAT doesn't scream 'nerd' to most eighth grade boys, well... I guess I've lost touch.<br /><br />Which is certainly possible.<br /><br />But there seemed to be quite a lot of vaguely mean-spirited-ness towards any character who was, I dunno, outside of the wholesome white bread mainstream.  (OTHER than the homeless kids who Theo tutors in English and their SPOILER illegal immigrant secret witness golf course employee cousin END SPOILER.)  But Theo's uncle is kind of a hippie and he lost his license for sketchy lawyering, and his friend April's parents are GASP! \\"an eccentric antiques dealer\\" and a goat cheese-maker who apparently \\"torment\\" her.<br /><br />Anyway.

B003C1QIO6|2.0|Jack Johnson blws.    This is music for Art or Film majors at UNCW to play on their acoustic guitar to try and pick up women.  You can't get any more lame and desperate than that.  Enjoy listening to this guy while his music is being played at the *2010 Little League World Series* along with the Jonas Brothers!    I used to somewhat enjoy a few songs off his 1st album. I really did.  It was somewhat new and catchy.  That was when I was 19 and a Sophomore in college and used to get high.  It's just super lame now to come across people who are like 25 and 26 that solely want to buy a ticket to a Jack Johnson show just to go get high in the lawn.  And then on top of that, I'll ask these same people, \\"So are you a big JJ fan?\\" And they're like \\"Nah, not really, I'm not a 'JJ Fanatic' persay, his music is just real CHILL.  I mean, it's CHILL man.  It's CHILL music.  It's like sitting at the beach and smoking pot.  It's so CHILL.  How can you not like CHILL man?\\"      How about this: CAN your Latest Jack Johnson CD, Go pick up a TOKYO POLICE CLUB album, and never use the word \\"CHILL\\" in your vocabulary ever ever again.
630587493X|5.0|In gathering information to update my science fiction book list, I found that this movie was based on Isaac Asimov's novella by the same name (which became a full novel called The Positronic Man).  Having read more than 20 SF books by Asimov, I couldn't believe I missed this.    I was enthralled from beginning to end:  marvelous production, tremendously talented cast, and such a beautiful score by James Horner (which rivals -- to my mind -- his soundtracks for Aliens, Titanic, and Avatar).  Needless to say, I now have the soundtrack CD as a companion to the DVD.  Chris Columbus directed with a gentle, yet powerful touch and drew me along emotionally at every turn.    I strongly recommend this glorious, heart-warming film; and you don't need to be a Science Fiction fan to appreciate it!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Strictly Ballroom should be (if it is not already) included on the list of all time classic movies. Witty and funny with some of the best dance scenes. This IS the way the pasa doble should be done!
0385342039|5.0|This was an interesting book.  Days after I finished the book, I still wanted to sit down and read some more.  I FELT the energy of the story a couple weeks after I was done!  I'd be interested in reading more books by this author.
0811806405|5.0|In my opinion this is the preeminent volume on guitar construction available, bar none. There is a reason this book is referenced by more builders than any other.      Although several reviewers felt the organization of the text was disjointed or hard to follow, I disagree. After having built a guitar I believe it couldn't have been organized any better. My only suggestion to those who have not yet read the book, is to carfully follow each and every word! The authors have been very deliberate in their instructions, and each sentence should be given attentive thought, and due diligence. I can't stress this enough. When you've finished your first guitar you'll be on your knees thanking them.

B003PR77I8|5.0|Others will have given a much more exhaustive review. I will add only a few bits of opinion.    This CD is the best of the old and the new sounds of Devo.  If you are a casual fan or a long-time die-hard you will find something to enjoy  here.  The beats are tight and jaunty, the sounds are pure D-E-V-O and the lyrics are what you'd expect:  a testimony to the current state of devolution.  Devolution is real and thankfully we have a conscious entity recording it for the future.    Don't hesitate. Do yourself a favor. Give the past a slip and pick up the newest Devo.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This was a touching story.  It made us laugh out loud and cry in some spots.  Well done!  The disc stopped (hung up) in a few places - not sure why - hopefully just a smudge on the disc or something fixable.

0307594777|4.0|The first book gets you hooked.  The second book is really good with fast moving storyline and great characters.  The third book has way too many characters.  You need a scorecard to keep up.  It is, for lack of a better term, \\"character laden\\".  Overall, I would recommend you buy all three and get started.  Well over 1500 pages in all and just a roller coaster ride of a story.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|I think the success behind this record is that people were curious: the whitest woman in the world singing the blues? Could she pull it off? The answer is yes, and no. As a Cyndi album it is one of the best things she has ever done. A dream team of musicians create a sensational sound, and Lauper sounds like she is having the time of her life. And that is the problem. The girl just wants to have fun. That sensational squeaky pop voice is just so full of fun it is impossible for her to sound like her heart been to hell and back. Do you have to be old and black to sing the blues? Well, not necessarily, but it sure helps. But you do need to have suffered. Maybe she has, but she of the yellow and orange hair is certainly not blue. So as a Blues album, 4 stars for trying. As a Cyndi album 5 stars! The live shows well be amazing.
0385504225|3.0|I'm sorry to say that this book was just \\"ok\\" for me. I found much of it pedantic and boring and tedious. I skimmed entire chapters, just wanting Brown to get on with the story. Perhaps I'm tired of secret societies and hidden mysteries. I don't have the patience to wait while Langdon works through symbols and codes to get the answer -- oh wait -- that's not all!  There was no universal truth or magical end result in this novel. In addition, it was overly long and could have used some serious editing -- or mass deletion of minuscule detail.<br /><br />I do not like the cliffhanger chapter endings that Brown used throughout this book. I never developed any kind of empathy or interest in the characters that populated this novel, and even Langdon became annoying as he \\"almost got it\\" many times. The revelation at the end was not unexpected and certainly wasn't so exciting that it was worth plodding through the previous 500+ pages.<br /><br />Parts of the story were interesting, but it seemed as if Brown tried too hard to blend religion and science and the ancient mysteries. Recommend that if you must read it, borrow it! Or better yet, wait for the movie...
B000L9IUPM|5.0|Do these guys ever stop?  Two (2) DVDs (and 1 CD) of pure entertainment.
B000001FDK|5.0|As a child this was one of my favourite movies, having a lot of repeat value to it. Taking out the soundtrack for another spin the other week, I have to say that the music still stands the test of time. In fact, it's probably improved with time, as my focus isn't just on the well known hit songs from the movie. Not sure what I'd make of the movie if I saw it again all these years later...perhaps I'd find the sight of actors in their 30s playing high-school teenagers a bit of a stretch? Anyway, this album is a lot of fun...more songs stand out all these years later to me and I don't mind the more obviously 1950s era songs. This is, after all, a movie about growing up when rock'n'roll was becoming mainstream, and teenagers had their own music to listen to, not the crooners favoured by their parents.      The classics (\\"//\\"):      Grease - has a great fanfare introduction with Franki Valli providing his hook laden vocals. Nice guitar melody and I like the female backing vocals too. The lyrics display the sort of wind change in popular culture which arose post World War 2. If Martin Heidegger ever was tempted to write a 3 minute pop ditty, this was it. Barry Gibb wrote this...a new song not on the original stage production.    Summer nights - has a familiar opening melody...mirroring the kind of bass line you find in a lot of songs...e.g. Long John Baldry's version of \\"You've lost that lovin' feeling\\". Has delicious alternating and contrasting male/female group singing and harmonies. \\"He said\\" \\"She said\\" kind of lyrics.    Born to handjive - funky rock'n'roll track sung by Sha-Na-Na. Cool drumming solo parts here. Brassy track. Really builds up a head of steam this track.    We go together - joyous male/female singing and harmonies with some boy scout type lyrical non-sense thrown in for good measure. Features piano, nice'n'bassy...good playing here, brassy at times with a solo. \\"/~\\".      Terrific songs:      There are worse things I could do - great lyrics and emoting by Stockard Channing, who has a good quality to her voice...a little punk at times and then a little Broadway. A song with heart and intelligence. Features piano, soulful sax and an organ at the end. Maybe the kind of song I like more as an adult now.    You're the one that I want - I liked this song more as a child, but it's still up there. Funky bass guitar, honky tonk piano and high energy all round. John Travolta does well here, despite not being a singer as such. John and Olivia Newton-John provide the vocal hooks in this song.     Greased lightning - a 'guy' song with some suitably fruity language at times! Half the time you can't understand what Travolta is singing, but that's ok. Cool male backing vocals and a great percussion breakdown.     Beauty school dropout - amusing song with a positive message. Not sure if as a kid I knew that Frankie Valli and Frankie Avalon were two different guys! Avalon sings this song. This is a song with heart and cute female backing vocals. Violins and piano feature...maybe it's a piano type instrument.       Good songs (\\"~\\"):       Hopelessly devoted to you - a nice, country style love ballad from Olivia Newton-John. Olivia has a silky smooth voice here and is accompanied by a lead guitar with a country twang to it. A narrative song with emotional inflection to it. Has male backing vocals.    Sandy - a slow tempo narrative song. Pleasant track, with Travolta doing some emoting. Maybe as a child this song wasn't one of my favourites...perhaps I found Travolta too histrionic back then, but now he sounds like he is almost adding punk vowels to his vocals at times. Has symphonic elements at times. Castanets might be used in this track for the percussion, I think.    Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee -  the song title references a Hollywood actress who played innocent and wholesome female characters. An amusing song with a swing to it. Stockard Channing again provides a good, distinctive vocal quality to this song and she is reallyfunny with some of her characterisations...e.g. the line where she mentions \\"Elvis\\". Has cutesy female backing vocals.      Then (\\".\\"):      Tears on my pillow - a Sha-Na-Na track and a good cover of the 1950s do-wop track. Features a churchy sounding organ.    Mooning - liked this song more on second listen. A 1950s style pop ballad with piano and bass. Female vocals at times.      The Sha-Na-Na songs:      These guys were a 1970s male vocal group who revived 1950s style music...do-wop and the like. They have six songs on the album...two of them are covered above. The rest are:    Blue moon - another cover and a good version of the standard. A slow do-wop song with bass, piano, and pronounced baritone vocals (amongst other vocal ranges).    Rock'n'roll is here to stay - the guitar intro reminds me of \\"The time warp\\" and later on I'm reminded of \\"Let's go to the Hop\\" (um, actually the song title seems to be \\"At the Hop\\", according to Wikipedia, who also list Sha-Na-Na as having covered it during Woodstock in 1969). A 1950s style rock'n'roll/do-wop song with an insistent bass rhythm. Features piano too.    Those magic changes - just one guy singing this song in an enunciated way. I like the note picking on the guitar as well as its tone. Some falsetto. Bassy track with a Hammond organ, I think.    Hound dog - a good, faithful cover of the song Elvis Presley made famous. Brassy, with honky tonk piano. Has backing vocals at times and some tough drumming (as did Elvis' version).       The rest:      It's raining on prom night - a nice 1950s style girl group song. Has girly lyrics. Singing is sort of country style at times. I like the guitar note picking on this song and the bass is good too. Has some sax, I think.    Alone at the drive-in movie - instrumental with a country twang to the guitar and some soulful sax. Cymbals for percussion and piano features.    Freddy my love - another innocent 1950s girl group type of song. Backing singers are uncredited. Hmm...the woman in the song seems knowledgeable about the amount of money her love makes.     Rock'n'roll party queen - seems ironic now...this party queen doesn't seem very wild! I'm reminded of Pat Boone doing his version of Little Richard's \\"Tutti frutti\\". Same vibe! Features the sax and piano.    Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee (reprise) - a companion piece to the earlier song of the same title, but this time with Olivia Newton-John singing. The track order is different from the movie...in the movie this song is followed by \\"You're the one that I want\\" which marks the transformation of Olivia's character Sandy. A genteel track which is just the flipside from the earlier song. Features piano and violin.    Love is a many splendored thing/Grease (reprise) - one of the great memories from the movie is hearing this instrumental (practically) get hit for six by the bold and brassy title track by Franki Valli. On the soundtrack the movie opener closes the album. For the first time you hear the entire instrumental of \\"Love is a many splendored thing\\", which is a symphonic track and features the sax, piano and violin. Strictly speaking it's not an instrumental...the song title is sung but it sounds more musical than vocal. This musical square peg in a round hole does, however, serve as a brilliant prologue to the title track...which seems identical to the first instance of this song, although it is labelled as a reprise.    Total running time: 63:49  Release: 1991  Rating: one of the all time great albums.
0385528752|5.0|This is the second book I have read by the Heath brothers and, just like the first one, it has not disappointed me.  If there are times when you feel is overwhelming you, that you can't make the changes you would like to make and may even be losing faith in yourself, then I strongly recommend you read this book.  Using the simple analogy of an elephant and it's rider, Chip and Dan create a powerful visual for understanding how our minds work and how we make our minds help us achieve the changes we would like to see in our lives, while, at the same time, being an absolute page-turner.

Never heard of AMJ before, yet her voice adds a beautiful energy to the music of PM.<br />This is a great album whether you are new or old to PM's music. Highly recommended
0743233832|5.0|Next to the Bible, this book has had the greatest influence on my life of anything ever written.  This vibrant translation of personal reminders that Emperor Marcus Aurelius used to keep himself humble & focused is shockingly poignant and timeless in its applicability.  It is divided nicely into bite-sized paragraphs & \\"verses\\" (except for a couple longer passages).  You can, and should, spend a lifetime learning to live out Aurelius' principles.

1439181780|5.0|I loved 'The Secret' - it changed my life in every possible way, in every possible area of my life - yet I would still say that Rhonda Byrne's second book,'The Power', is even better than 'The Secret.'  I think it is a deeper, more important book.  In fact, I don't think a book could get much closer to the very core of who we are and what life is really about than 'The Power' does.    I think this book has the potential to - and no doubt will - continue changing the world and changing humanity in the startling and wonderful ways that The Secret did.  If everyone in the world read this book... WOW, what a world we would live in!  What a world of beauty, honesty, kindness, compassion, understanding, harmony, peace, and LOVE!!!      'The Power' is filled with ancient knowledge that was and is known by the wisest of our planet, inspiring stories and real life examples, and so many practical ideas to apply to any problem in your life, or to anything you wish to have in your life.    This is a timely book... we are in great need, and it has come in response to our need.  I recommend this book - to everyone in the world!
0895292211|1.0|I have to confess that I couldn't stomach reading more than a little over two chapters of this book.  It was clear by then that this wasn't going to be worth the time to read.  I've read several dozen health-related books and this is the only that has provoked that response in me.  So what turned me off?  I started to get an uneasy feeling when the author stated that he spent a significant part of his career working for the National Enzyme Company, which specializes in selling enzyme supplements.  That's a conflict of interest that, at least for me, casts significant suspicion on the results of his research.  And I had the feeling that he was cherry picking the research of others to support his conclusions, though obviously I didn't stick with the book long enough to confirm or deny this feeling.<br /><br />But the thing I couldn't stomach was the proposition that over production of digestive enzymes by your body (to compensate for lack of enzymes in your food) causes your body to deplete a finite store of enzymes (which are also needed for metabolism), and once you've depleted your enzyme \\"bank account\\" you're dead.  So he basically proposes that the way to put off death is to eat lots of raw, natural foods (for their enzymes, which are destroyed when foods are cooked - this minimizes your body's need to overproduce digestive enzymes and thus preserves enzymes for metabolism) and to live your life in such a way as to minimize your rate of metabolism so as to preserve your metabolism enzymes.  Basically you should be a couch potato, but eat a very healthy diet.  Doing so will have you living to a ripe old age.  But if this were the case, wouldn't athletes all die young from over-metabolizing?  I think about my 91 year old Uncle Bill - exercises religiously, smoked and drank a good part of his life, and eats very poorly.  Yet he's in better shape than most folks 20 years younger.  Now some people would correctly point out that as you become very fit your BASAL metabolic rate declines.  They may point to this as proof of the author's point.  But people only become fit by being very active, so their overall metabolic rate is higher than that of an unfit, sedentary person.<br /><br />At least it wasn't a total waste.  I did learn there are three types of enzymes - metabolic, digestive and those contained in foods.  And I suspect there is benefit in preserving the natural enzymes in most foods, which is part of why folks on a diet that avoids processed foods enjoy better health than those eat too many processed foods.  But if I could give this book zero stars I would.e declines.  They may point to this as proof of the author's point.

0061564893|1.0|I bought this on a whim without doing any research on the topic. After reading the first few pages, I realized that either 1) we better start rewriting all the history books, or 2) 1421 is bogus. A quick online search yielded numerous links to professional historians who believe the latter, but be sure to search for yourself. Just don't buy the book before reading up on the controversy.
B002RVZV9K|2.0|This project sounded like a documentary director's wet dream project: Take three of rock music's most famous guitarists who have never met, put them on a sound stage with old chairs, a set of guitars, amps, effects, and LP records, hire about thirty camera people to document the \\"event,\\" and see what happens.<br /><br />Well, unfortunately, what happened was not the mind-blowing experience I was expecting. You would think that there would be more magic in the room than there was, but you cannot force magic to happen in a contrived environment. You can hope that \\"something\\" will happen, but oftentimes it's just an average experience, and that's how this DVD left me feeling. Like I had witnessed something average.<br /><br />That's not to say that this DVD is worthless. It has wonderful moments of Jack White making a diddly-bow, The Edge going to his old school and showing how he works effects into his songs, and then Jimmy Page smiling like a school boy as he plays an old record from his youth.<br /><br />But I so wanted their meeting to explode with magic and passion, and it just did not live up to the hype for me. While it was nice to see The Edge and Jack White seemingly in awe of Jimmy Page as the latter began the first notes of \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" one song is not enough to make their meeting worthwhile.<br /><br />See it for the individual documentary pieces on the three, but don't expect any real energy or magic from their meeting because it never materializes. At least, it didn't materialize for me.

0316017922|3.0|I purchased this book for my son's 11th grade summer reading for school.  My son says this book is hard to follow, mostly because it tells different stories of peoples success, but has no continual story line.  He really doesn't enjoy reading this book.  I am however extremely happy with the ordering experience from Amazon concerning the purchase of this book.
1416511946|2.0|First of all, this book is drivel.  It is the addicted ramblings of a crybaby rock star. It is in this weird graphic format with drawings & magazine like pages which is supposed to make the reader feel more like he/she is actually reading a diary. However, the drawings are not done by Nikki Sixx. They are fabricated by some MTV artist who wants to make the book feel more \\"rock star.\\"<br />Secondly,in addition to the diary entries, we get this ongoing commentaries by Nikki in present day & also different people in Nikki's life who add their two sense to the situation which gives the book a cheap reality show feel. Sometimes this was helpful giving a \\"behind the scenes\\" look at different perspectives, but sometimes it was really just annoying. Like I think we could have done without Vanity's (oh, excuse me, Evangelist Denise Matthews) commentaries.<br />Thirdly, I would have really enjoyed seing some of the actual photos of Nikki, however they were all splotched up with the inky graphic junk scribbles that covered the whole book. The content, the actual writings are poor. To sum it up in one entry: \\"I don't like fame. My family f___ed me up. I am rich & can buy whatever I want. I am so depressed. I haven't showered in 8 days. I pissed the bed. I am going to do a bunch of blow/smack/pills/ and drink a bottle of JD. I love music.\\"  There you have it, the book in one entry followed by a commentary saying how brilliant Nikki was & how f___d up he was.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Motley Crue! I think they are one of the greatest rock/metal bands ever. I think drug & alcohalism is a terrible problem. I think Nikki Sixx is an interesting person with talent, but you just won't find evidence of that in this book. Do yourself a favor, if you want to read a real rock 'n roll autobiography of substance, skip this one & read Slash's \\"Slash.\\"
0312330537|1.0|The author's command over the language and his writing is nothing short of phenomenal.  He doesn't pull any punches describing the abysmal and deplorable conditions in the Indian prison system & his description of their escape from the Australian prison is suspenseful and compelling.  Crisp editing of the voluminous material would have gone a long way making this a more appealing read.    Also, it was very hard to empathize with the numerous characters since none of them lead remotely \\"normal\\" lives.  I believe that the book does not, in spite of all those pages upon pages of writing, succeed in making the reader get past the initial distaste or prejudices towards characters who resort to questionable livelihoods or lifestyles prone to failure.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|This is a great movie.  Yes, it's different from the book, but don't let that keep you from watching it.  Both young and old will enjoy this movie.  There is humor in it for both adults and kids.  It is very entertaining and never a dull moment.    Now that being said, do not buy this on Blu-ray.  I bought this from SunCoast, and the blu-ray disc will not play.  I went through and made sure my player software was up to date and it still wouldn't play.  I took it back and got a replacement.  But again the blu-ray disc would not play.  Ihe DVD disc plays fine.  This is a great movie and I recommend buying it, but get the DVD version.   Do not waste your money on the Blu-ray.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great series! I'm not usually one to watch a series, but John Adams is fantastic. You don't have to be a history buff to understand. (Although I'm sure it doesn't hurt..)
B001GCUO4S|1.0|I was excited about seeing the last installation of this series, but i was badly let down. Although the third wasn't the greatest, it was good enough to watch again. In this movie i could barely pay attention, and almost fell asleep! TThe story line was the same ole same ole, death is coming for you, but the actors were not as personal or as good as they were in the first 3. If i were you, i would read about it and let it go, it wasn't worth the few dollars i paid for, and i know i won't be watching it again! A big disapointment!
B003KLGKAA|5.0|The quality of the download was high, as well as being able to be watched while it was still downloading a portion of it!

B002RWKSII|5.0|I can't remember the last time I got so much for my money. I'll admit, I'm a die hard Beach Boys fan from way back, and I think Brian Wilson is a living musical legend (I love both Lucky Old Sun and Smile). But this album is so much more than a Beach Boys send up. From the Bossa Nova-like 'S Wonderful, to the soulful, big band sound of Summertime, this album is just beautiful. I love it more each time I listen to it (and it's on heavy rotation). I can't recommend it highly enough!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I purchased this Kindle book in February, having joined the \\"Gold Book Club\\" here at Amazon.  It was the first selection chosen by this new club and since it is a mystery I thought I'd love it, since the reviews were excellent.  Unfortunately, it took me forever to get into this one................the title is a bit misleading for someone like me, who expected to be introduced to the girl described in the title early on, but after beginning the book at least 4 times I had all but given up trying to read it, since it begins with so much information that to me was dry and uninteresting.  However, after watching the book remain on the NY Times best seller list for months, and all the excitement about coming movie, and reading about the authors other books,I gave it one last try.  I am so glad I did!  Once I got used to the odd names and locations and got the drift of what was coming I was finally \\"on my way\\"!  I just finished it, after staying up practically all night reading and am now a huge fan of Larsson, along with so many others.  I definitely will purchase the next books in the trilogy and expect to enjoy them just as much as I finally did this one.  Really sad that such a talent is no longer with us, one can only speculate how much pleasure he might have given us had he lived.
0393312836|3.0|I suspect that 95% of those familiar with A Clockwork Orange have seen the Stanley Kubrick motion picture, as opposed to read the rather short novel written by Anthony Burgess.  It had been a long time since I'd seen the movie (25-30 years), so aside from a broad remembrance of Malcolm McDowell raising holy hell and undergoing \\"reconditioning\\", I remembered little of the story.  In fact, in an introduction to the 1986 edition of the work, Burgess explains that previous American editions, as well as the Kubrick film, neglected to include the 21st chapter of the story.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS, FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE STORY<br /><br />The story is set in a near future dystopia, in which our humble narrator, Alex, epitomizes the rampant lawlessness and thuggery of society.  After several instances of extreme antisocial behavior, he is arrested, convicted and incarcerated.  Faced with political backlash as a result of the high crime rate, the powers that be have concocted an effective rehabilitation technique to combat recidivism.<br /><br />Alex is the perfect lab rat for the new technique, which utilizes harsh negative reinforcement to forestall even the thought of violence.  Effectively cured, he is released into society, where he becomes an unwilling tool for both the current administration as well as its opponents.  At issue is the morality of the treatment itself.  As the prison chaplain opines:<br /><br />\\"It may not be nice to be good Alex.  It may be horrible to be good.  And when I say that to you I realize how self-contradictory that sounds.  I know I shall have many sleepless nights about this.  What does God want?  Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness?  Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has good imposed upon him?  Deep and hard questions, Alex.\\"<br /><br />And later, a former victim of Alex's wrongdoing states, \\"They always bite off too much.  But the essential intention is the real sin. A man who cannot choose ceases to be a man.\\"  In any event, after a political struggle, Alex's conditioning is reversed.  The previously omitted 21st chapter deals with Alex's free choice to be good or be bad, and the inclusion of this chapter, in effect, changes the entire book, in my opinion.<br /><br />No review can be complete without reference to the style of language used throughout the novel.  A mixture of English and Russian (referred to as nadsat) serves as the dialect for the teenage punks of the era.  While slightly offputting at first, the meaning can be easily discerned through context, except on rare occasions such as the following:<br /><br />\\"This evening at the Korova there was a fair number of vecks and ptitsas and devotchkas and malchicks smecking and peeting away, and cutting through their govoreeting and the burbling of the in-the-landers with their `Gorgor fallatuke and the worm sprays in filltip slaughterballs' and all that cal you could slooshy a popdisc on the stereo, this being Ned Achimota singing `That Day, Yeah, That Day'.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy.event, after a political struggle, Alex's conditioning is reversed.

0439023483|4.0|Review Posted on [...] by Laura Lynn<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I had no idea what \\"The Hunger Games\\"  by Suzanne Collins was about before picking it up two days ago. I had heard my friends ohhh and ahhh, but had no idea of the plot, the genre or even the characters. I laughed when I saw I was number 75 on the hold list at the library, but figured I would read it when my turn came. My turn came this weekend when a friend lent me her copy.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is set in the future after war has eliminated the United States and left the country of Panem in its place. Each year the 12 districts within this country are required to select 2 youth to fight in a gladiator style battle to the death. Huger Games follows the struggle of the teenagers from District 12 from before they are chosen until the battle is over.<br /><br />Now I have to admit this is not my usual fare. I do not read blood and guts stories, nor do I typically enjoy suspense novels, so I was a little apprehensive about the topic. If I had not been quickly drawn into the narrative I'm not sure I would have finished it. As it was, I was so quickly absorbed that I read almost all of the book in one sitting.<br /><br />Aimed at the teenage market, the story is easy to read and the characters appeal to the adolescent crowd. That said, there is something universal about the struggle to survive that I could relate to, even buy into. While the main characters, Katniss and Peeta, are from different parts of society and their individual struggles differ, both must fight to the death inside the arena.<br /><br />The story does not focus on killing as much as I had expected, instead it focuses on relationships and emotions. Topics such as friendship, loyalty, love, determination, hope, betrayal, fear, insecurity and survival make the story a rich backdrop to interact with the characters.<br /><br />At 374 pages, I finished the story in 4-5 hours, and found myself unable to put it down toward the end. Suzanne Collins does a wonderful job of making the reader care about Katniss and I found myself worried about how the story would turn out.<br /><br />While The Hunger Games may not make it into the classics with Bronte or Austen, it is a fun read that will draw you in and keep you engaged. There are two more books in the series, Catching Fire and Mocking Jay which hopefully will wrap up a few loose ends and complete the story of Katniss and Peeta.

0143118420|3.0|Review posted on [...] by Laura Lynn<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"Eat Pray Love\\"  by Elizabeth Gilbert has been out long enough to be in paperback and already be a movie, so do not think I am a trend setter in any way. I picked up the book on Costco's book rack and I admit it took me quite a while to get through it.<br /><br />Here is what I learned from \\"Eat Pray Love:\\"<br /><br />  1. I don't relate to Elizabeth Gilbert.<br />  2. I relate far too much to Elizabeth Gilbert.<br /><br />While I have never had the specific experiences related by the author, I felt myself drawn into some universal truths she discusses in the book. I know what it feels like to be crying on the bathroom floor in the middle of the night. I understand the pain of examining past decisions. I remember what it feels like to start a journey to find one's spiritual self.<br /><br />In all honesty, I picked this book up for two reasons, first, I remember Oprah liking it a lot, and I wondered why. The second reason, and I can't believe I am admitting this, is because this copy had Julia Roberts on the cover, and I wondered why she would care enough to make a movie about it. I am sorry to say there was nothing deeper than falling for the marketing that made me read it.<br /><br />I never was engrossed by the book. Trust me, I wanted to be. I took turns being enthralled by the story and uncomfortable at how close to home it hit. If the author didn't have such a clear way of describing thoughts and feelings I doubt I would have felt pierced to the core more than once.<br /><br />The story is broken up into three sections, easily defined by the locations she traveled. The author brings the reader on a trip of self discovery she made for herself. It is strange how her self discovery could be mine too.<br /><br />The book is written in the first person, and while most of the names have been changed to protect the innocent, and not so innocent, you get a clear picture of her relationships with those around her. Elizabeth spends one year to find herself and her happiness. She starts out a mess and ends up a renewed person.<br /><br />I have heard there are many people upset at the selfish nature of the author and there is a lot of \\"self\\" in this book. Then again, I'm not sure how a journey of self discovery could be anything else.<br /><br />At 331 pages, \\"Eat Pray Love\\" took me a lot longer than usual to read. It was an easy read, but an intense amount of introspection. While I enjoyed the story, and the freedom she found on this journey, I was made uncomfortable by her decisions at times. I understand it was not the author's intent to make me comfortable, in fact, much the opposite, so I would say she did a great job.<br /><br />\\"Eat Pray Love\\" is one of those books I am glad I read, because I learned a lot about myself. I appreciated the author's honesty and ability to cut through the nonsense of a situation to tell the reader exactly how she felt. While not exactly a pleasure read, or a self help book, for many this story will walk a fine line between the two.starts out a mess and ends up a renewed person.

B003L20IJM|5.0|This is a nice family film, somewhere between a 4 and 5 star, so I rounded up.  Nannie McPhee (Emma Thompson) is a strange nannie.  She is quite magical and quite delightful, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  (Of course, better to be a-head than a little behind, I always say.)<br /><br />The story begins on the family farm, in the English Countryside, far from London.  It is WWII.  Isabelle and the 3 children are taking care of the farm while the husband/father is away fighting in the war.  The farm is owned by the husband and his brother Phil.  The brother lives elsewhere.<br /><br />Phil wants the money from his half of the farm and is pestering the heck out of Isabelle to sell it but she is trying to hang on until her husband returns.  Meanwhile, Phil has incurred some gambling debts - actually, he bet the farm.  Two \\"Hit Women\\" are after Phil now, threatening to remove his kidneys.<br /><br />The 2 cousins are coming from the city (London) to stay at the farm because bombs are being dropped in big cities.  Of course, there is a clash between the farm kids and the city kids from the minute the city kids step out of the limo and into the \\"Land of Poo\\".<br /><br />There is magic in the air when Nannie McPhee shows up at the front door and quickly gets the five fighting children in line.  The animals become magical, too, including the adorable baby piglets that do \\"synchronized swimming\\" (like the old Esther Williams movies). There is also a bird that belches all the time and an adorable baby elephant.<br /><br />Again, it's a cute film that you can enjoy with your young children.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|I have always loved Eminem, even when I didn't like his albums. I didn't care for Relapse or The Refill, but I love this album.The only reason this wasn't given 5 stars, was that I felt there was something missing from the album. I realize that this is his \\"sober\\" album and that he may be raw and healing, but we need Slim Shady on the album. Every track seemed that it was a personal, angry, and yelling out at the top of his lungs. It was a very powerful album, but I felt it needed something, if only one, goofy track. I'm glad the skits are gone, as I've never liked those and felt that they wasted a track on each album. Love ya, Em, but do us a favor on the next album...lighten up a little.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|You can read my review of St. Anger on the product page if you like, to know how I felt about that album. With that said, I listened to this album with one eye closed, hoping it wouldn't suck. Well, it doesn't suck, it blows...everything the hell out of the water. This is the album that should have been released instead of St. Anger. With Trujillo firmly in place as the \\"new\\" bass player, it goes for the throat and doesn't let off. The only bad thing I can say about this album is, that it looks ridiculous to see a grown man head-banging in traffic, and you will be...you will be. I'm out!

0307454541|5.0|Suspense, thriller, entertainment...these are the three words that come to mind when reviewing this book.  It has great character development, which allows you to feel as though you really know and understand the characters in the book.  There were a few times when I was a bit unnerved with some scenes, in terms of the injustices the heroine endures (can't say more - don't want to get a spoiler alert on this review:))...it is definitely not a book for the very young or highly senistive, but it is a real page-turner for those who like mystery, action and drama.
0765322889|4.0|If this was the only book Steven Erikson ever wrote it wouldn't be great. Not terrible, but not great.  However, Steven Erikson crams this book full of the details that make up the foundation for the next nine.  The first half of the book is confusing but if you tough it out and drive through, it tells a great story.  And it makes the next books so much more pleasant.  This is one of if not the best series I've ever read, period.  Don't let the first half of this book make you miss out on the rest.  Also, and this is important, don't try to understand everything.  There are so many races and rules of magic and lore in Erikson's world that until you get a little more immersed, it's not all going to make sense.       The characters in this first book can be a little one dimensional but that's only because he's setting to many stages at once.  Erikson writes some of the best characters I've read.  His dialogue and comedy are hands down THE BEST. And like George Martin he definitely has the ability to give the end of chapter jaw dropping, \\"Holy crap I have to call someone and tell them what just happened in this book oh crap none of my friends have read this far yet what do I do!\\" Factor.      I recommend this book to anyone who knows how to read.

Reminded me of the Bulgarian Women's Choir, and I mean that as a compliment since those girls really kick butt.    Vedder finds that uncomfortable place between human expression and the untamed animal spirit. Always has - that's why he is, imho, so captivating. I'm glad he's still angry. God knows he's got no shortage of things to be angry about - I'm right there with you, Ed. One word: war. That's all I'm saying.    What a perfect choice Penn made.

B003L20ICE|4.0|THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT has been heaped with praise from critics, including significant talk of Oscar nominations.  The entire time I was watching the film, I couldn't help but wonder if at least some of that stemmed purely from a need to praise a film for showing a \\"normal\\" lesbian family...regardless of the quality of the film.  I know viewers (or even just people who read a description of the film) who have problems with gay issues will no doubt bristle at this film and its efforts to \\"push an agenda.\\"  It would be nice if a movie could just be judged for its own merits, apart from political/social concerns...but I suppose that isn't possible.    However, I'd like to try.  Because the nice thing about the film is that it DOESN'T really push an agenda.  It's just a quirky, indie-spirited film with above average performances and script...full of frustrating characters who do lovely things and stupid things, just like real life.      It tells the story of a long-term lesbian couple (Annette Bening, playing a doctor & Julianne Moore, playing the mom who has trouble settling on anything to do, but is currently trying on a \\"landscaping designer\\" hat), who have two teenage kids, Mia Wasikowska, just turned 18 and Josh Hutcherson, around 16.  Wasikowska is studious and sincere...darn near what anyone would call the perfect daughter.  Hutcherson is more of an athlete and goof-off.  He's very nice, but is easily swayed into engaging in inappropriate behavior.  Early on, the film implies that he's curious to know what it would be like to have had a father-figure in his life...so he persuades his sister to contact the man who donated the sperm that resulted in him and his sibling.  (By the way, one thing the film doesn't get right...the two siblings get along famously and never seem to get on each other's nerves.  Sure.)  So she calls \\"dad\\" (Mark Ruffalo, a restauranteur who also owns an organic farm  co-op, drives a BMW motorcycle and is the most laid-back, cuddly, sincere guy around), and the three meet.  The meeting goes well, and eventually, to the shock of the two moms, the family of 4 now seems to have a fifth person.  While Ruffalo isn't exactly a part of the family, his relationship blossoms with the kids and with Moore (who gets a job redoing his landscaping).    Bening gives the most nuanced performance here.  She's the least easy character to like.  She's always been the major bread-winner.  She's a doctor, so she is naturally a bit of a perfectionist.  She tries SO hard to be even-handed and fair, but she's actually a tightly-wound bundle of nerves who would clearly be happier just telling everyone else what do, when to do it, and what to say.  She no doubt imagines herself as a \\"hip & cool\\" parent, but she's actually super uptight.  But underneath it all, we see the deep, abiding love she has for everyone in her family.  She CAN be warm and open...but she can be really nasty too, especially when she drinks, which she does too much of.  Her character goes through a number of subtle changes throughout the film, and later, when she is wounded...it is her pain that we feel most acutely...even though she is the character we've felt most distant from.    Moore plays a woman who was clearly a bit more of a free spirit in her youth, and that has translated into her feeling a bit adrift in middle age.  She's tried several careers, unsuccessfully...and clearly feels some guilt at having not contributed as much financially to the family, yet she also resents being made to feel guilty and foolish.  She is more open to Ruffalo's charms, and this causes significant friction.    Ruffalo does his best Mark Ruffalo-like performance.  He's a ladies' man who doesn't have to try.  He plucks organic tomatoes, he runs a funky restaurant, he drives a truck and wears leather, yet is gentle and passionate at the same time.  You can see how women might struggle to resist him...but you have to wonder if someone like him really exists.  His best scenes are when he spends some time with his son...you seem him struggling between just being a pal (the easy choice) and being something of a role model (the tricky choice).  He enjoys time with his daughter, but she's so together that it's easy for him...it is the son looking for a father-figure that draws out deeper feelings in Ruffalo.  He's forced to examine the path his life has taken thus far.    There are many bumpy spots along the road, and naturally many old feelings are aired, wonderful verbal fights are fought and tears are shed in abundance.  In the end, what makes the film a cut above the average is the fact that each character is sharply drawn, each has admirable character traits and deep flaws.  The actors do a good job, but they also have a good script to rip into.      I've only known a small handful of long-term lesbian couples, and certainly I know nothing about the intimate details of their private lives.  Thus, I can't comment on the credibility of the lesbian relationship depicted in THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT.  But the details of Bening & Moore's love life are fairly specific, and it all FEELS credible.  I'll leave it to others who know better to say if it really IS credible.  But Bening & Moore have good chemistry, and that certainly helps.    This isn't the greatest film ever (or even the best of the year so far).  It didn't take me through a wrenching emotional journey (as it clearly wanted to).  But it DID take some unexpected turns, featured great writing and good performances...and for that alone, I can strongly recommend THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|It is a pretty good animation and it must be the first cartoon ever where we see jason todd as robin, even as a flashback. It is basically the movie version of the comic book story with jason's return plus a couple of pannels reminding as of the death in the family story arc. Some of the dialogue is precise, which i appreciated, other key elements of the story however, such as how jason was revived or the death of his mother, have been altered(for the worse)or totally erased. The comic books in my opinion are always better than the movies and the cartoon(with the exception of the 60s series which was a pop phenomenon of its own, but this is as good as a cartoon straight to video can get. The extras are poor, but the story plot is fascinating and the dvd is a must for every die hard fan and good entertainment for the rest of you:p. Buy this, i m just nagging!
0143118420|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, which had been highly recommended to me by several people.  What I picked up was one of those reads that starts interesting and slowly falls into the world of WTF in a few short chapters.    The story totally comes across as though it's written from a teenage girl's point of view.  I don't mean it's juvenile read; rather it's hyper self-aware much in the same way teenaged girls seem to feel like they are on a stage in the center of the universe.  Instead of reading a memoir of someone going through self-awareness, I felt like I was reading a caricature of a movie about a teenager writing her future memoir about going through self-awareness.    I wish I'd skipped the book entirely and gone straight to the movie.  At this point, I have no interest in watching the film because the books are usually better.
0670021652|4.0|This book did not disappoint as the follow up to Eat Pray Love. I appreciated that Gilbert continued her story and her memoirs pretty much from where the first book left off. I also appreciated that she took a different tone and style with this book and she brought in a lot of history on marriage that I found very fascinating. Good stuff!

B003IPC5SO|5.0|Now that she's done saving Starship Titanic with the Doctor, Aussie pint-size pop phenom Minogue returns with a terrifically well crafted album of infectiously optimistic songs. No room for bluesy, whiny feelings: put this on and dance, baby! \\"Get Outta My Way\\" will get you hooked, but you'll come back for the rest -- and wish there were more tracks to play. Unlike what is so often the case where you buy a CD for one good track and the rest is low quality filler, every song on this album is a little gem. To be perfectly honest I never imagined I'd ever buy a Kylie Minogue CD, but... it's just that good. Already on my desert island list!

0393039102|5.0|\\"The Railway Man\\", by Eric Lomax, is his memoirs of his experiences in World War II, as well as his life before and after the war.  As a boy, Mr Lomax became a railway enthusiast, a life-long passion, so it was ironic that after his capture as a member of the British Army, after the fall of Singapore, that he was forced to labor on the Siam-Burma railroad.  He describes the horrors of the torture and mistreatment that the Japanese inflicted upon the other POW's and himself.  And after the Japanese discovered a map of the railway, that Mr Lomax had been drawing, he was accused of being a spy, brutally tortured, and nearly died.<br /><br />After the war was over, and he was repatriated, he writes about how the British government did virtually nothing for the returning veterans in the way of medical treatments or counseling.  It's not for nothing that the Far Eastern campaign has been titled the \\"Forgotten War\\".<br /><br />Fifty years after the war, he discovered that the Japanese interpreter during his tortures was still alive.  As with many, if not most veterans from the Pacific Theater of World War II, Mr Lomax utterly hated the Japanese and had no intention of every forgiving them.  However, after learning of the great lengths his former adversary (the interpreter) had gone to after the war to make amends, he eventually agreed to meet him, and forgave him.<br /><br />The book is well written and moving, and is one of the better memoirs dealing with the war in the Pacific.
6305718954|5.0|I have watched this 4 times on different stations, Each viewing I came away with more information, that I had missed the 1st or 2nd time I watched, Thanks to Everyone that wrote a wonderful review, I love this movie, and from the reviews I purchased this , Can't wait to get it, ;-)
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I thought it was a great movie because Rob Pattinson is awkward in this movie and he pulls it off. The love story is interesting and the ending is great because you don't expect it to end in that manner.  I recommend it for Rob Pattinson fans, but be prepared to see him in compromising situations with his lover.
0765348276|5.0|A great book, in my opinion, doesn't hit you over the head with the fact that it's great. And this is a great book. I read it straight through, just enjoying the action. Then when I got to the end, I realized how truly good it was. It was funny, it was exciting, and it even got me thinking about what it means to be human and how humans might fit into the universe. Outstanding work!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|The lessons are clear and further illustrated by the recent win at St Andrews by an Afrikaaner who wished Nelson Mandela a happy birthday on the day of his victory. Mandela reached out to his former opponents in a racially charged atmosphere. He made the first step and had to face opposition from his own African National Congress. And not just to the rugby team but all of the South African whites, even bringing some of the former body guards of Mr. Declerk to guard himself. At the end Mr. Mandela makes a point of thanking some of the Afrikaaners for displaying the new flag of the new nation.  Mr. Obama's first act after election was to meet with Mr. McCain. Then he met with conservative pundits; met with leaders of the Dixiecrat-Republican party. Made a point of inviting them to work on major legislation with him.     AND THEY SPIT IN HIS FACE.    What a difference.

0439023513|5.0|The Mockingjay delivers.  It is every bit as gripping as its two predecessors, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  It is just as grisly and gruesome as well.  Collins does not sugarcoat anything, which only adds to the depth of the story.    Katniss Everdeen accepts the role as the Mockingjay, the rebels' icon of defiance towards the Capitol.  However, she is tormented with Peeta's imprisonment within the Capitol.  He becomes their voice to attempt to stop the rebellions in the districts, while District 13 tries to fuel the cause.  Katniss often opposes authority and instead of acting on orders, she often acts on her own accord and tries to do what is right.      If the political themes are not enough, the Katniss/Peeta/Gale love triangle is ever-present and I am sure many people have their own personal opinions as to who Katniss should wind up with and why.    Many characters return from the first two books and there are a host of new characters for readers to love or to hate.  Although be forewarned, the book is about a war.  If you thought just because the Hunger Games were over, life would be sparred, think again.       My only disappointment in the Mockingjay is that it is the last book in the series.
0439023483|5.0|Once in awhile a well-hyped book comes along and actually lives up to that hype.  \\"Hunger Games\\" did that for me.  I honestly avoided this book for awhile because I figured I didn't really want to read a book about people starving.  Then my fourteen year old daughter read it and gushed over it.  She explained the basic premise to me and I was intrigued.  The book still sat on my shelf for ages.  I have been reading about all the excitement for the final book's \\"Mockingjay\\"'s release.  Somehow that provoked me to finally pick up the book and read.  I didn't quit until it was finished. Its scary to think our country could turn out the way it does in this book, yet is it so far beyond possible?  Could this happen to us?  This is only one theme I found myself contemplating during and after this book.  The other is our love of reality t.v.  Is our society such that we would place bets and openly watch and cheer as our children are forced into a battle for their lives?  It is literally kill or be killed here.  What is even a shy 12 year old going to do in such circumstances.  In \\"Hunger Games\\" one such shy child gets picked for the Hunger Games but her older sister Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Into the arena she goes, along with 23 other unlucky children.  What happens after this is amazing.  The story never lacks in pacing or plot.  The real beauty of the story ends up being the relationships that take place in the arena and of course the study of how each of the contestants react to what happens to them.  I will say there was one odd thing in the book that I felt came out of nowhere.  At the end there is a scene with mutts or muttations (I can't remember exactly what they were called).  Katniss realizes something about them in that scene and I thought it was over the top.  Not only that, but then it was just dropped.  I have shrugged that incident off as something that will be explained in more detail in the next books. I did end up shedding a tear in a few places but my biggest sadness was when I realized the book was over and I didn't have the second volume \\"Catching Fire\\" yet.places but my biggest sadness was when I realized the book was over and I didn't have the second volume \\"Catching Fire\\" yet.
0143038419|3.0|I really enjoyed this story about another woman's journey to find herself after giving too much of herself over to marriage which left her not knowing who she is anymore...as women we tend to fill roles to the fullest extent leaving us all too often feeling empty and becoming someones daughter, mother, wife etc which is wonderful until the marriage ends or changes and the children leave home.  I found the book difficult to read at times as it rambles on in places there was no need...just not very well written I thought but overall I loved this journey she shared with us and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

0199535639|4.0|I picked it up without knowing anything about it and had fun unraveling its hidden gems. Additionally, there were some extremely interesting bits of legal history about women, property, and inheritance. I thought it perhaps a tad too long, the story in all likelihood could have been conveyed in fewer words.
0375842209|5.0|Somewhere I read this book was for young adults. Please, please, do not ignore this book because of that category--especially if you're of an age to remember anything of World War II. The way Zusak has put this story together, the way he describes things, it's simply masterful! I've told my reader friends about it, no matter their ages. Wonderful!
B001O9BB3G|4.0|The World Unseen was a great read. The writing was smooth and effortless to read. The characters were sympathetic and well drawn, including several secondary characters. The prose vividly portrays the time and place in which the characters exist, bringing it all alive within the reader's mind.<br /><br />If you're looking for a typical lesbian romance though, you may not be that interested. More than one third into the book the two women had only met briefly twice. The story follows their separate lives and then eventually weaves them together. The book is nicely paced, always moving forward. But it's not a fast pace. It's more of a slow moving river as opposed to a rushing torrent.<br /><br />What I truly appreciated was the glimpse I was given into the ethnic and cultural conflicts of South Africa in the early 1950's. The story takes place near the beginning of apartheid, which was a bit of an eye opener for me in terms of its timing. As Europe and North America moved towards events that would finally bring about more racial equality, South Africa began aggressively moving further in the entirely opposite direction.<br /><br />The only reason that I didn't rate The World Unseen with 5 stars is because I felt the ending was much too abrupt. I'm not one of those who needs every ending to be nicely tied up and everything clear. Vague or open-ended endings have their place in fiction and it's one that I can often appreciate. But in this case I was expecting a bit more and felt teased by the author. It didn't ruin the book for me by any means, but at the final few paragraphs I was thinking, \\"Hey wait a minute, you can't stop there!\\"<br /><br />Kindle Note: Unfortunately, the Kindle ebook version is a mess in terms of formatting. I am returning the book because I don't believe I should have to pay ten bucks for such a poorly made product, even if the novel itself was excellent. Near the beginning entire blocks of text are indented. After that, indents seem to go away almost completely. This makes reading a chore, especially when dialogue is involved. There are also a lot of errors like dropped words, along with a few places of funky random formatting such as a few words suddenly underlined. I will be contacting the publisher in the hopes that they will pull the ebook and redo it and then inform me when it's done. If so, I will repurchase the ebook and remove this part of my review.ing a chore, especially when dialogue is involved.

B0016BPWNM|1.0|I enjoy Jim Henson's films. The Dark Crystal is my favorite movie.   Labyrinth, however, is a real dud. It is a hodge podge mishmash of muppet nonsense, bad acting, bad singing, and a horrible plot. I guess I'll join the minority of one star ratings.
B002QH2NUA|2.0|This has got to be the worst live Cd of Paul McCartney. I really think he has lost the finer things of him.  His songs are ok,but his singing is bad. Hits too many high notes and cracks. May be he still has to pay for his divorce still,poor guy. BUT NOT WORTH BUYING PLEASE! How many cd is this ,either a best of or Paul  live,let's get real. Stick to his older cd's,they will bring you much satisfaction! This STINKS!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Even though I am a guy who had accompanied his wife through every film relating to \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" I enjoyed reading the book. Jane Austin gives details of the characters' thoughts that make the story, especially the development of the two main characters, convincing. The other characters are amusing and vivid. The dialogue is delicious with treats like, \\"Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\\"<br />In my Kindle version random line breaks occur. For example, one often encounters \\"Mr. [line break] Darcy,\\" even when \\"Mr.\\" is almost the beginning of the line. Although this is a little annoying, the Kindle version can't be beat for price and convenience.

030716327X|2.0|I was alarmed when I received the Pat the Bunny gift set of book and bunny. The plastic sleeve over the box had broken Scotch tape and the sleeve itself was quite dirty. A gummy residue where a tag had been removed looked as if it had been stored on a filthy floor--dirt adhered. I used alcohol to finally scrub it off. It seemed there was a small pick in the bunny--a loose thread (?)<br />In all, I was quite disappointed at the hygiene of the package--after all, it IS a baby gift, and everything for babies ought to be pristine.  Nevertheless, I did not send the box back and demand another, because time was of the essence. I do think you should know how baby gifts are being stored there at your warehouse, and, perhaps, make some improvements!
B003C1QIO6|4.0|I like this music, that's all there is to it.  With that said, I found a lot of his earlier music to be much more emotional and engaging.  This title had the right words, but didn't seem to have the quiet passion of his earlier work.  Maybe it was just the noise level; the volume and intensity of sound on this CD is mostly constant, which relegates it to background noise more sing-a-long (at least in my car).    I still like it.
0061537934|1.0|O,  I love auto racing , especially F1, and the references to that are OK, but  somewhat hyperbolic. For those that don't know today F1 is about the money, the racing is now an afterthought. But, to the point,  this is a stupid juvenile story that I'm sure will end up on Lifetime. A formula tear jerker with all of the elements of the genre completed. As a neurologist  I'm amazed that this person who wrote this didn't get some medical advice. Low grade gliomas that transform to high grade just do not behave in this fashion. I've seen enough of them and have consoled enough  patients and families over 35 years to write my own pathetic novel. Looking at the website and seeing that people are discussing this as a great literary  piece and are having discussions as to the philosophical significances of the questions raised reminds me of the fact that no one has ever lost money underestimating the stupidity of Americans. Only if I could cash in on this!
B003O6W30C|5.0|I have been an avid Hanson fan since the very beginning and this album showcases all of Hanson's best qualities with a few surprises. I heard people say that this album is not as deep lyric wise as the others have been and I do agree to a certain extent. However songs such as, \\"Carry you there\\", \\"These walls\\", and \\"Use me up\\" have very deep meanings which could be a different meaning for each person, you will just have to listen to see what i mean. Although they are not using words such as hypocrisy, or any other dynamic word at which I cant think of any others they have used. I had to go to the dictionary in the past while listening to Hanson songs just to figure out what certain words meant. Anyway, \\"And I waited\\" to me sounds like a song taken right out of the hands of Michael Jackson of whom they greatly admire and look up to. This is a great summer album and I can not wait until the second single, \\"Give a little\\" I can not sit still when that song comes on! This is Hanson and that's all I need to know!      Enjoy!!!
1934356557|5.0|I must admit that there was barely anything new to me in the book, but I have been in the field for quite a few years, dealing with many projects, so I had the \\"privilege\\" of seeing many horror stories. Still, I feel the book is valuable even for seasoned veterans. The main benefit is that the author organized and grouped the anti-patterns, each one is analyzed very well and contains some wise, unbiased suggestions. Each chapter stands on its own and can be read stand-alone.   The book is worth an extra star because it deals with problems related to both database's design and application developing; most book out there either cover one or the other.  This should be a mandatory reading for beginner DBAs and application developers, veterans may like it too, since it can help refreshing some concepts and can be used as a reference too.

B003OFHMKO|5.0|I've been following Esperanza's career for a couple years now. Needless to say, I was very excited for this release. I'm happy to report that Esperanza managed to exceed my expectations with Chamber Music Society. During the evolution of Jazz, many different iterations have risen up. It's very easy to classify these iterations. Thankfully, this is not the case with Chamber Music Society. Not only does Esperanza break the mold and define a new style of Jazz, she makes it impossible to classify with any certainty. I look forward to many more albums from this young prodigy!

0439023513|4.0|So, fellow Hunger Games fans, Mockingjay was really good, but was really unexpected. I won't spoil it for you, but several people that you think wouldn't die actually die. *DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO KATNISS ENDS UP WITH* Since I am a fan of Katniss and Gale, I did not like the ending or the Epilouge. Yes, Katniss marries Peeta at the end... *CONTINUE* The whole story plot is a battle between the country and the Capitol-- that much is already made into sense in Catching Fire. There is a lot of Katniss just being inspiration for Panem in the first two parts of the book. The major action doesn't even start until almost the end of the book, i.e. no major wars or attaks on the Capitol. Anyway, my point is, although Mockingjay was really good, it was a)totally unexpected b) could be a disappointment of who you wanted Katniss to be with,  and c) just kind of disappointing and the end is totally shocking.    Something happens to Peeta.  Something happens to Gale.  Something happens to Katniss.  But most shockingly...Something happens to Prim.    I will now leave you to enjoy the Final Book of the Hunger Games-- MOCKINGJAY.    Have Fun!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This was an excellent adaption with great acting.  Of all of the Jane Eyre adaptions, this is by far the best.      *I recently watched to 2011 version and while it wasn't bad, I still like this version better.
1416562605|4.0|Balram Halwai was nicknamed the White Tiger by the inspector of a so-called school because, alone in the class, he could read and answer a few questions, and he was therefore compared by the inspector to the rarest of animals in a jungle.  And a jungle is portrayed in the rest of the book.<br /><br />When it opens, Balram is living in Bangalore. He has read that Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Prime Minister, is about to visit that city and would like to meet some Indian entrepreneurs to hear the story of their success.  The novel takes the form of a letter from Balram to Wen Jiabao:  India has thousands of entrepreneurs of whom Balram is one, and he will tell Wen his life story.<br /><br />This begins in a dirt-poor village whose people are bled dry by brutally extortionate landowners.  We know from the start that the police are after Balram now, so we can assume that his entrepreneurial progress from that start will not be a law-abiding one.  The way he tells the story, it is only with alertness, cunning, obsequiousness and ultimately crime that you can you pull yourself up from the bottom in a society where bribery, often corruption and extortion for services not rendered, at times backed by crude violence, are rampant at every level: schoolmasters, landlords, businessmen, police and of course politicians.  \\"You eat - or get eaten up\\". And connections are absolutely essential.<br /><br />Balram has left his village for a near-by town in search of work, and there he is employed as a humble driver and general household servant (but that is already a big step up) by a big noise simply because he comes from the  same village as the latter.  Then Mr Ashok, the son of the big noise, becomes his patron and takes him with him to Delhi.  Ashok is a weak and foolish man; but he is a benign, almost fatherly employer.  And Balram's resentment of the difference of wealth and status between them grows.  He has already reflected that the oppressed classes have servility bred into them: they may cheat their masters in petty ways, but it does not occur to them to do anything dramatic - he sees that tendency in himself.  And now there is a scene in which he goes to a zoo and sees a white tiger pace up and down, trapped behind his bars of his cage; at about the same time there is the unexpected victory of a socialist politician in an election.  In a slightly surrealistic chapter, Balram's seething feelings drive him to break free and to commit the crime for which the police are looking for him.<br /><br />The police don't find him, and he makes his way to Bangalore where he adopts a new identity and employs the usual corrupt means to set up his own prosperous business.  He knows that one day the police may catch up with him and that bribery might then avail him nothing; but  \\"I'll say it was all worthwhile to know, just for a day, just for an hour, just for a minute, what it means not to be a servant.\\"<br /><br />The story is told with verve, cynical humour and sharp observations of many aspects of Indian life.  For all Balram's guile and worse, we sympathize with his resentment of the sleazy, grindingly unjust and cruel society in which he has to live and make his way.masters in petty ways, but it does not occur to them to do anything dramatic - he sees that tendency in himself.

B002QQ8HAG|4.0|There is a lot to sink your bleached whites into with this double DVD offering, if you're a dyed in the wool fashionista.  There are always two sides to a story and after seeing The September Issue, I am more inclined to think that the person who wears Prada isn't quite the devil she is made out to be.  My hat off to Anna Wintour for baring herself (allowing very unflattering close ups, both physical and psychological) to give everyone a safely distanced glimpse into the ever grueling, sometimes ruinous world of fashion.  But even bigger than this revelation is the genius of Grace Coddington who, as Vogue's star art director, is behind the issue's every bit of brilliance and magnificence, and is really the other half of this film.  The relationship between her and Miss Wintour is the driving dynamic behind the astounding success of the most powerful magazine in the industry today.

0439023513|5.0|Katniss Everdeen is still in the middle of a revolution. Its the Districts versus the Capitol and to her it feels like she never left the arena of the Hunger Games. Certainly this time she has more allies and a wider playing field, more weapons at her disposal, but she has even less to be sure of in this than any other game she has played in.  Even those closest to her keep secrets from her and have sides she never saw or was able to recognize before.  Gale is more than happy to take his place as a rebel leader in District 13's militarized society  while Finnick, the social stud has sunken into near madness at the thought of loosing the person he holds dearest.  That which weighs most heavily on Katniss' conscious is the Capitol's parading of Peeta, the one thing they have that can continue to hurt Katniss from afar.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has finished out her trilogy with another amazingly strong offering. From the beginning the reader, like Katniss, is thrown into yet another entirely new world, with false safety and unknown dangers. District 13 is not the idyllic safehaven that Katniss had been told it would be.  These rebels are more like the imperial fighters on the Death Star than the rag tag group of ruffians that one usually expects from a band of rebels (such as the refugees from District 12 that Katniss holds dear).  Collins does a great job of exploring the shades of gray that a war is made of, who is really innocent in these events? Is there ever really a `good guy' or `bad guy'? And what does it mean to  be a hero? A symbol of hope?  Katniss spends the entire book trying to figure this out.  After spending the book trying to be shoehorned into what other people think she should be she does what she has always done best, be herself.  And with all of Collins' wonderful exploration mankind being its own worst enemy, I think perhaps this is her strongest message, one that \\"that guy Polonius\\" said to Mel Gibson (or rather Hamlet) `to thine own self be true.'
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I went to see this movie during a Saturday afternoon matinee, where I had a few hours to kill. I enjoyed this movie so much and there was so much going on with the story, that I went back on Sunday evening, the next day, to watch it again and was just as entertained looking for the nuances and details in the movie. Similar to Avatar, which I also watched twice during a 2 week period, I caught a lot more information the second time around. I fully intend to purchase the movie as soon as it is available on DVD. I hope there is a director's cut with additional footage. I went in with low expectations, but was throughly pleased and surprised. I also enjoyed the new twist in the story between the two Predator species...I am sure this will lead to more interesting sequels:)

B002RWKSII|5.0|[[ASIN:B002RWKSII Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin]]Brian has come up with the goods again, a great album and project, and thank god for his resurgence in the late 1980's. Brian has respected Gershwin (quite rightly)but transformed his songs into Brian's sounds and very few artists are capable of such wonders, but BDW is one. I agree with a previous fan that it could have been longer particularly RIB. I think it will be a great success and he deserves this tribute in the swan song of a great if erratic career. These are very modern arrangements of timeless and classic songs. Long live Brian, the true pop master of the universe.

The second one was blah.There was nothing exciting.They just added more bad guys and more boom.Where was the story that pulled you in or make you go:\\"noooo way\\".. it just lacked in that deparment.The effects were really well put together.music was good and just the sound effects overall were really good.The second one definetly has more humurous scenes and cheesy twists<br /><br />If you're going to make sequel, atleast try to get the same cast members to be in the second one.The new replacement didn't really make the movie better.it just didn't fit in.The movie is just cheesy(not spoiling)<br /><br />a Third one?  wahts it going to have? more robots then the second one? every gadget going to be pocket size?not really looking foward to seeing the third one.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Sometimes it seems that neither Scorsese nor DiCaprio can do wrong.  When I first learned of their intentions towards this film, I anticipated an intricate character study with Scorsese's eye for detail.  An old-Hollywood homage was expected, with tuxedos and gowns, cigarette holders and champagne glasses, all the glamour on which the industry was built.  Maybe even a monocle or two.  What I didn't expect for it to be a completely epic, entirely engrossing adventure into a reclusive billionaire, a troubled genius, a man who chased dreams into the clouds while embracing the individual capitalist opportunities available to all willing Americans.<br /><br />After watching this film again recently, I was reminded why there is nearly no doubt that, in my opinion, Scorsese is the greatest American director of all time and DiCaprio is the best actor of his generation.  Each of Scorsese's shots and directorial choices are perfect.  Every movement, tic, and cough from DiCaprio is compelling.  As ambitious as Hughes himself, the production design is fitting for such an incredible movie.  At 3-hours, it could feel a bit long in tooth for some.  For most, however, it simply rushes by without being rushed.<br /><br />If broken down into vignettes, milestone moments of the film could have each hooked me into History channel biographies, if not full length films.  The adventures in love, aviation, movie making, and Senate scandals are all the stuff of story books and legends.  Howard Hughes lived enough in his early years that his later, more depressing years are just about ignored without being insensitive or incomplete.  A brilliant choice of editing.<br /><br />This dazzling biopic of Hughes' rise to fame and fortune pairs perfectly with Scorsese because he manages to do what most others think can't be done: He created a 3-hour epic that flies by...just like the Spruce Goose.  Bravo to all involved.<br /><br />Jason Elin
B003RNXIBK|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album.<br /><br />\\"Recovery\\" may ostensibly be about Eminem's early journey down the broad highway of contented sobriety, but it leaves me jonesing like a dope-sick junkie, tormented by an itch in my ear canal that can only be scratched by another listen.<br /><br />The first time or two I heard it, I could take it or leave it. I could listen to it recreationally--say, every two weeks or so. But not now. I'm getting to the point where it's interfering with my other musical interests. Last night, I got a couple new albums off Amazon; it was time to get into some new stuff, I figured, and I put the files on a thumb drive and brought them to work, fully figuring I'd listen to them.<br /><br />Instead, I relapsed on \\"Recovery.\\"<br /><br />\\"Just one more,\\" it told me, whispering softly in my ear in the way all addictions do. \\"No one will know. It'll be our little secret.\\" And so I pressed \\"Play\\" and whisked my cares away.<br /><br />That's not to say it's a perfect album. In some ways, it's actually inferior to \\"Relapse.\\" (Am I the only one who loved that album, by the way? It was cartoonish and overblown, sure, but it was also wickedly funny, and thematically tighter than almost any other rap album ever made, right down to the packaging; the five of us who still occasionally buy CDs were treated to a jewel case with a scribbled prescription from Dr. Dre and a CD that looked like a PUSH DOWN AND TURN pill-bottle top. Even Eminem seems cool on it these days, though; on this album's \\"Talkin' 2 Myself,\\" he tells us: \\"Them last two albums don't count. Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing `em out,\\" and later on \\"Not Afraid,\\" he mentions that \\"perhaps I ran them accents into the ground.\\") \\"Recovery\\" is looser in good and bad ways. The songs don't flow together in a coherent conceptual arc the way they did on the previous album. Still, the best ones are arguably better than anything he's ever done, and almost certainly better than the high points on \\"Relapse.\\" It sounds like he's having more fun here (for instance when he talks about \\"Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta\\" on W.T.P. or raps \\"Excuse this corny metaphor, but they'll never ketchup to all this energy I've mustard\\" on \\"Never Over\\") and yet rapping more seriously about his addictions, his early recovery, his troubled marriage, and the shooting death of his best friend, Proof. \\"Changes,\\" for instance, whips all of this together in a stunningly effective concoction; while this is not exactly new territory, he's at a new vantage point and has, at last, a peaceful end-of-the-road perspective on it all. And it's perhaps the most affecting thing Em's ever written; I still get goose bumps every time I listen to it. (On a side note, this is one of the most effective uses of a sampled song I've heard in rap, with Ozzy's vocals perfectly complementing the story arc that takes him from the throes of drug addiction to the early stages of recovery.)<br /><br />And yet Em's still not always realizing that less is sometimes more. Rather, he's trying to give us everything--the sensitive and reflective Em we first caught glimpses of way back on \\"Stan,\\" and the old, violent, misogynistic bad boy; the humble persona who wants us to accompany him on this new road, and the outsized ego that would prefer to do it all alone. The drinking and drugging may be gone, but Em's still a work in progress when it comes to women. Granted, it works to great effect on \\"25 to Life\\" where he raps about his dysfunctional relationship with hip-hop; however, \\"Seduction\\" feels like a completely unnecessary track--it's gratuitously boastful, even by rap standards, and it feels somewhat lazy compared to the fierce energy elsewhere on the album. (The next track, \\"No Love,\\" excellently samples Haddaway's \\"What Is Love\\" and features some of `Lil Wayne's best recent rapping; it starts out pretty decent--but after Lil' Wayne's friendly, lazy, conversational flows, Eminem blows it up with an incendiary rap spoofing Kanye West's famous drunken VMA Speech interruption.)<br /><br />This album might have been better if he'd been willing to pare it down in the interests of thematic consistency and personal growth. Still, the overall message is that he's taking steps along a new road. However haltingly and imperfectly at times, he's still progressing, as a rapper and a human being, and that's a vibe I like having in my system.<br /><br />Now, if only I can get back to recreational usage...West's famous drunken VMA Speech interruption.)

1594488916|4.0|When I ordered this book, I thought it would be about Daniel Spiegelman, who in 1994 stole roughly $1.8 million in priceless books and manuscripts from Columbia University's Butler Library.  Although Spiegelman is briefly mentioned in THE MAN WHO LOVED BOOKS TOO MUCH, the book is about another notorious rare book thief, John Gilkey.  Gilkey, unlike Spiegelman, has apparently never made national news headlines.  But \\"John Gilkey\\" has become a household word among rare book dealers, particularly those who belong to the Antiquarian Bookseller's Association of America (ABAA).<br /><br />This book is the end product of the author's extensive series of interviews with Ken Sanders (a rare book dealer and the \\"bibliodick\\" who caught Gilkey), other ABAA members, Gilkey's family, and Gilkey himself.  Although the author in no way condones Gilkey's criminal behavior, she is relatively kind to him.  She allows Gilkey to explain to readers for himself why he steals rare books, by simply reporting, more or less neutrally, on what he told her in their interviews. (Some of the interviews take place while Gilkey is in prison, some take place in downtown San Francisco after he is released from prison.)<br /><br />To say that Gilkey \\"loves books\\" is perhaps an overstatement.  He is fixated on the idea of owning a rare book collection, because of the enormous cachet that such a collection enjoys.  A rare book collection, after all, tells the world that the owner is unquestionably a person of refinement and taste.  Gilkey not only sees nothing wrong with \\"getting\\" rare books from book dealers, he hates spending his own money on books.  He has schemes that make it easy for him to get rare books \\"free\\", and he likes the fact that rare books appreciate in value.  Put simply, Gilkey steals rare books because he wants them, and because he can't afford to buy them.<br /><br />This book provides an interesting look into the mind of an unusual, specialized kind of thief.  It also offers insight into the rarified world of rare book collectors and dealers.  It tells a story, is well researched, is well written, and includes just the right amount of detail, so that the reader doesn't lose interest.  This rates 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars because the subject matter is limited to the exploits of a single book thief.<br /><br />As it turns out, there is a book written about Spiegelman ([[ASIN:0275993310 The Book Thief: The True Crimes of Daniel Spiegelman]]), which I now hope to be able to read.into the rarified world of rare book collectors and dealers.

B002NXSSBU|2.0|Half way through the second song on this CD \\"Lost Paraguayos\\", I turned it off. I thought to myself maybe it's my CD player, maybe it's me, because the sound on this supposed audiophile CD reissue is incredibly muffled and dull and nothing like what it should be.<br /><br />Audio Fidelity AFZ 058 is a 24 Karat Gold CD (HDCD encoded) issued in the USA in November 2009 and is a numbered limited edition of 3000 (33:36 minutes).<br /><br />AF's releases have had very mixed reviews despite the blurbs all over their gold die-cut card-wrap packaging about \\"Ultimate Sound Quality\\", no \\"compression\\" and analogue masters being put through \\"digital converters\\" etc. It's odd, because I raved about their Joe Walsh CD \\"The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get\\" which is fantastic - so why are some of their issues so underwhelming (Faces, Montrose, Randy Newman jump to mind as well).<br /><br />I then dug out my \\"Reason To Believe - The Complete Mercury Studio Recordings\\" 3CD set from 2002 with its stunning SUHA GUR remasters (has done loads of great work for Hip-O Select on Motown and Verve recordings) - and there's the Rod Stewart sound I want - full, lively, every instrument alive - kicking like an audiophile title is supposed to do.<br /><br />I now find that there's controversy about their recent Simon & Garfunkel CD for \\"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary And Thyme\\" too which sounds exactly like the Columbia CD on a few years ago that you can get for a few cents. And to add insult to injury - Audio Fidelity have even removed the \\"From The Original Master Tapes\\" wording from the card sleeve of their new 2010 \\"Talking Book\\" reissue by Stevie Wonder! An audiophile reissue company that doesn't want to have the words \\"original master tapes\\" on their reissues - how ludicrous can you get.<br /><br />The packaging too has come in for flak - it's a CD single jewel case inside and not an album one - with the original album artwork reproduced in card form sat beside it. But you can't read anything off the over-sized card repro (as nice as it looks) and because it's a CD single jewel case there's a useless insert and no booklet. It's the only release they did like this and was a packaging exercise that didn't work. But that's not what any punter is buying this CD for - they're looking for the best sound - and for me - it's just not there. The \\"Reason To Believe\\" set with 5 full albums, non-album single sides and previously unreleased outtakes and a decent booklet is the winner you want - with genuinely great remastered-sound from an award-winning engineer.<br /><br />With it's iffy packaging, high price tag and above all suspect sound - I would say that this is a reissue to avoid I'm afraid.ice as it looks) and because it's a CD single jewel case there's a useless insert and no booklet.

B000000HVE|3.0|Although I thoroughly enjoy this album and have been listening to it constantly, I was very disappointed when it came in as cd instead of the vinyl record which it said it was.
1400095204|4.0|Adichie's writing flows smoothly and carefully over this story, shaping the narrative into a digestible package when it threatens to become a jagged sentimental war story. For those who care about history and the way we are constantly forgetting and airbrushing major events out of our collective memory, this is a welcome novel that brings to life the terrible Biafran conflict of the 1960s. At a time when the tragedies of colonialism and its last monstrous offspring, Apartheid, are being forgotten, this reminds us that even stable successes like Nigeria have a dark past. And that any nation can at any time be ripped apart by the foul bigoted eddies circulating among its peoples.<br /><br />While only cursorily mentioned in this novel, the Biafran conflict that serves as the engine of this book saw the beginning of the doctrine of humanitarian interventionalism with the subsequent formation of the Nobel-prize winning group MSF (Doctors Without Borders). And as of 2010, the foreign minister of no less country than France is a physician who was one of those initial activists in Biafra. So, we can see that those terrible events still affect us today.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm sure this will sell well, but I will not spend a dime on this because it does not include the original trilogy. I tried to watch Episode IV Special Edition last night. Every time it gets to the \\"Look sir, droids\\" scene with the cartoon stormtrooper on dewback in the background, I end up turning it off. I just can't watch it. Something just doesn't sit well with all the extraneous additions. I don't mind a little cleaning up and tinkering. For example, I kind of like what they did with cloud city in Episode V. There were just way too many changes for my taste though. It's just my opinion and I'm glad some people will get enjoyment out of this set...just not me.  Update: I just knocked my rating down from 3 stars...nnnooooo to this set and the complete saga!
B000002H6C|5.0|Hands down, the best metal album metallica ever put out. it's mean, angry and full of rage and revenge, I love it. If you need some music to train to or just kick some ass and get pumped then this is it.
B003HLM2QO|2.0|When I heard Ozzy's last album, Black Rain, I thought it was time for him to hang it up. Not only did Ozzy seem to lost flare, but Mr Wilde seemed like he was playing with a broken hand. It was the worst Ozzy album to date, and I feared the same when I heard this. The album starts out a little rough, with some pop-rock modern day garbage of the first two tracks, but then things get a bit interesting. Ozzy throws it a little old-school going back to the days of \\"No More Tears\\" which wasnt his greatest, but its nice to hear that he digs up some Rock and Metal, two formats that are pretty much dead in todays pop_music world. Is this perfect, no. Am I trying to be objective and realize that the days of Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman are over (and Sabbath days are wayyyy over) Yes, I do! But its not a bad listen, there are a couple of songs that will make it to your MP3 player. A bit below average, but better then fair, kinda sits right on that border. Check out a few tracks, I am sure you will enjoy some of this, and I do give Ozzy credit for putting a much better effort into this album. Even though it will still be nice if he stopped tinkering with his classic albums (dammit SHARRON!!) and left them alone, remastered, not re-recorded and remixed
B0037MNKDC|5.0|I have not read these books.  A friend was talking about the show (and I don't have HBO) so I rented the first season out of curiosity.  I am a BIG Twilight fan--a huge vampire fan in general--but this was so much more exciting to watch.  It certainly is not for children under the age 16 (even that might be too young) due to the nudity and sex scenes.  This is something fun designed for adults to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />I finished the entire 1st season with in 24 hours.  I am now on season 2 and almost have it finished.  Can't wait for season 3 to come out on dvd this Christmas.  By then I will have HBO and can watch season 4 on TV next summer.<br /><br />If you like vampires--I recommend watching this at least once.  If you are NOT open minded then you may want to pass this up.  Vampires and sex ususally go together and in this series there is a lot of it.  I also enjoy the characters and the plot behind the series.  The characters are not the typical \\"hollywood glamourous\\" as we see in other shows, but that is what makes this show so much better--they look average like the rest of us.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy Perry's sophomore album definitely will not dissappoint! It is such a strong follow up to her previous hit album \\"One Of The Boys\\" but Katy took a different direction in this album. The songs are so much more mature and real. There's so many different styles in this album, from angry rock tunes, to ballads, and of course the fun-loving hits we all adore! There's party songs, sad songs, weird songs, everything. As a whole, the album tells a great story, and is just such a strong follow up to her previous album. MF

030726999X|4.0|Alexander Zalachenko, a Russian spy, granted asylum in Sweden in the 1970's I believe, is a sociopath who tried to kill his daughter, Lisbeth Salander.  Lisbeth is a genius, not exactly a social butterfly and is probably an Asperger's candidate.  As Lisbeth recovers from her bullet wound to the brain, a gentleman who represents a secret channel within Sweden's equivalent of the CIA, slips into Zalachenko's room and snuffs him.  Why??  What was this guy and his small group of followers afraid of?  Mikael Blomkvist and his journalistic crew, along with a slew of officials representing various government agencies are on track for solving this national challenge.<br /><br />Steig Larson's writing style may not be what you are used to however it grows on you.  His descriptions of characters and locations are vivid.  You may find that at times he is redundant or overly describes a scene that you believe should be skimmed over.  However, it is unique to him and I can gladly say I read the entire trilogy.  I will miss subsequent expeditions by Mikael and Lisbeth.
0439023513|5.0|As with my other immediate reaction posts, this will probably not be the most organized, coherent blog I write. This is because I literally just finished reading Mockingjay, and it was sufficiently mindblowing. Congratulations, Suzanne Collins, for successfully making my brain explode. Obviously, my thoughts were all over the place while reading, and are in no better state at this moment. The suspense of this book kept up throughout the entire read, down to the very final pages. I found myself sitting here, grasping the last few pages in hand, completely clueless as to how Collins could successfully wrap everything up so quickly. She did. She freaking DID.<br />The book starts with a one month time jump since the events of Catching Fire. Everything that happened there is explained, which, by the way, put Catching Fire in a new (and better) light in my mind. There's a lot of preparation and build up for all the big battles, and trust me, big battles there are, literal combat and raging inner psychological wars. All the while, Katniss' every move is still being filmed, a move I didn't quite appreciate (and, well, neither did Katniss!). Both Katniss and I really wanted to see more of her in combat rather than on camera.<br />I was really glad to see the romance toned down. Very early on, Collins makes it clear that Katniss is in no state to be choosing her \\"Team\\", at one point blankly making a statement through Katniss: \\"The very notion that I'm devoting any thought to who I want presented as my lover, given the current circumstances, is demeaning.\\" This isn't to say that her inner struggle between Gale and Peeta doesn't exist, just that there are obviously bigger issues at stake. She does eventually (very eventually, it's not until the last page, plus the epilogue) make her choice, and while I am not at all a fan of the choice she makes, it's still written in an incredibly powerful emotional (or, as the case is, emotion-less) way. The way her castoff \\"Team\\" is treated, though, just slightly enrages me, as it is a character plenty of fans were very emotionally invested in.<br />Anyway, to more important things.  I do not like the epilogue.  I do not think Katniss going back to District 12, popping out babies and living a normalish life with Peeta is in-character at all.<br />There is so much effective foreshadowing done in this book, as well as throughout the first two books in the series as well. It's still extraordinarily difficult to tell exactly where the plot will take the reader, but ohh, after finishing the book, it's amazing how well all the pieces, laid out from the very beginning, all fit together. There's nothing I like better than a book that sets up an intricate mythology and mysteries surrounding that set-up, and then resolves all of the plot threads.<br />For the longest time, I was convinced that Gale would flat out sacrifice himself so that Katniss could end up with Peeta. Guess I was looking at this book and its author incorrectly. They would never dumb themselves down to that level of desperate romantic plot, and I'm so thankful I was proven wrong.<br />I came to a big realization while reading this series. It is very rare for me to like a main protagonist in a book or series, and for once, I do. I love Katniss. She was, surprisingly enough to me, my favorite character. Such a complex girl (and that complexity is fully fleshed out in this book, as is...well, pretty much the complexity of everything), with so much to face. Her realizations throughout this book about herself, her place in the world she inhabits, are emotionally raw in their realism, and her end emotional state left me paralyzed in its intensity. The story is darker than the first two, darker than most books I've read, and the progression of Katniss's emotional state is the most compelling and, in a twisted way, beautiful, part of the series for me.<br /><br />Rating: A much deserved 5/5, just slightly enrages me, as it is a character plenty of fans were very emotionally invested in.

B002RWKSII|5.0|I wasn't looking particularly forward to this release, even considering the one-two punch of the awesome 'Smile' and 'Lucky Old Sun.'  I'm a life long Wilson fan, but I thought I'd rather hear Wilson come up with some new stuff rather than trawling through Gershwin's songbook - most of the recent songbook efforts by big name musicians come across as hopelessly cheesy to me.  Plus, while I do love some of Gershwin's work (especially 'Rhapsody in Blue'), there's plenty that doesn't do it for me.  I've had a chip on my shoulder about 'Summertime' ever since a couple of gals did a caterwauling version in my elementary school talent show.  Surprisingly, Wilson pulls another ace out of his sleeve, giving these tracks a full-on Beach Boys sheen with the arrangements coming across just as strong as his 'Pet Sounds' best.  Plus his voice continues to improve - he still sounds a little aged, which is certainly to be expected at age 68, but these are the best vocals he's committed to tape since the 60's.  I even dig the orchestrated version of 'Summertime.'  The Wilson/Gershwin 'collaboration' isn't quite up to the standard of the Ira/George classics, but they're certainly more than respectable and within spitting distance of the real Gershwin.  I remember hoping several years back that Wilson would team up with the High Llamas Sean O'Hagan to get back to that 60's production sheen, but happily Wilson is once again able to do it again all by his lonesome.  I'm still a little wary of Wilson's upcoming plan to record versions of Disney songs, but if he can pull it off this well, then we're all in for another great album.  At least we should get a 'Surfer Girl' arrangement of 'When You Wish Upon a Star.'  I won't at all be disappointed if Brian stays away from a 50th anniversary Beach Boys reunion if he keeps it up on this level.  The only way to improve on this would be to give it a full on wall-of-sound mono mix from Brian himself (although Al Schmidt's stereo mix is nothing to complain about).  Whataya think, Brian?complain about).  Whataya think, Brian?

B001QWBM62|5.0|First off, I'm no professional audio guru. I'm a nerd that does outdoor videos with his Canon 5d Mark II.    I don't need to tell you about the technical aspects, but I will say that it does exactly as described. It also comes with a wind blocker so no need to buy one. The audio is great about picking up only the angle of degree you have it set to. I do some beach video and it was important that I didn't pick up a lot of garbage from passerby's, etc. If you're right up on it of course you will hear outside noises but for interviews or specific sounds where your camera is pointed this is perfect. I also bought an adapter so I could put it on the hotshoe of my 5ds which helped. For the price this can't be beat.     Bill

Maybe I read them too close together, maybe I just wanted a different feeling book.  This felt too much like the first.  I'm excited about the last, but dang it, let's not go in that ding dang Arena again!
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian has raised the bar again. I love his interpretations on this project. You could almost imagine that he wrote these himself. I can think of no reason for him to do this except the pure love of music. Einstein said \\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\\". If Albert had been a musician, he would have founded The Beach Boys. I suppose the only thing left now, is for Sir Paul to do an album of Cole Porter numbers.

They had chemistry and that above everything was what made the movie successful. The story was good, I think there were only a couple of things that bothered me about the movie. The beginning with the credits was too long and a cartoon.... wasn't appealing to me and the birth scene was also too long. Other than that the story was beautifully done.  I was actually at the premiere in LA and have seen the movie several times at the theatre. I guess you can tell I loved the movie. I'm happy to purchase the DVD for home from Amazon because they have it before anyone else.
006145205X|3.0|In my humble opinion, the Rational Optimist ought to have been a pretty compelling read.  Ridley, the author makes a strong case for the fact that people are getting better at living, that there is a rational expectation that the human condition is not in decline, that in fact we have proven ourselves quite capable of self improvement, of adaptation through adversity and through sheer persistence and applied thought. Our ability to specialize and shape cultural growth through economy is one of the most powerful engines for our species that the book can actually make you feel pretty good just about being a human.    He does spend time talking about coming dark days, that there are economic destabilizations in front of us, that the US may be in decline as a super power and that global warming may make things uncomfortable for a period.  But he also makes a case that humans have always adapted and won out through adversity.     The author does present an exhaustive amount of research to support his observations. At times, he presents too much detail, making a case for 'time to go to bed' rather than continue reading. I'm perfectly willing to sit still through many the book on similar tropes as the Rational Optimist, but there were parts that I found difficult to read through.    If I had a criticism of the text, it presents evidence that there are reasons to be optimistic but that there may be difficulties ahead. Ridley does little to offer solution, pointing out the problems and, honestly, they seem a little self serving.  I am optimistic. I don't believe America is in decline.  I don't know much about global warming (nothing a regular NYT and Science subscriber wouldn't know).  But if he does believe that, he could offer solutions for consideration that help to outweigh some of that self serving advice.    Last, I judge books by their readability and whether I am likely to either revisit or recommend them.  I am likely to do neither in the case of the Rational Optimist.  Instead, I'll optimistically add it to my collection and not recommend or reread it again.  Sorry...three stars is about all I can do for it...
B00007KWHG|5.0|I purchased this CD after returning from a Las Vegas trip and a viewing of the Jersey Boys musical. I have always enjoyed the music of this group since I was a young teenager back in the 60's. Basically this CD contains everything I ever enjoyed listening to. The sound is excellent on all tracks. If one were to purchase another CD of this group with more songs, those songs would likely be ones rarely heard by those who listened to the radio back in the day and may most likely be mediocre filler. This CD has all one would want.
B002LFAHBO|4.0|This is not the type of movie I would typically buy in blu-ray.  However, I discovered quickly that the movie is enhanced in this format.  The scenes are crisp and clear.      The movie is about love at Christmas time, showing different lovers, married and single.  It shows the complexity of relationships.  The cast is excellent.  The music is wonderful, bringing back memories.  There are surprises along the way, as characters connect and disconnect.  What fun!
0764207407|5.0|It's so much fun to read a Jane Austen-lover's thoughts and insights as I'm going through Sense and Sensibility.  I probably would have lost interest and put off finishing this book if it weren't for how much I look forward to learning more about the era and customs, and knowing I'll be laughing out loud over something the insight author has said in the margin about what is going on.<br /><br />I hope they release more of these because I want to read all of the Austen works with this insight author!  :)
0887307280|3.0|This book is considered by many to be one of the must reads for small businesses. It tries to drive home the point that a business that will provide the owner some freedom to live outside of the business must have some systems in place to accomplish this. I agree with the need to provide consistent service and the need to have rules in place to provide freedom. I do not like the writing style that is condescending as he looks down on us lowly business owners from the heights of his noble mountain of knowledge.
0393072231|5.0|I've tired of reading books about the subprime mortgage crash, and thus took five months to pick up \\"The Big Short.\\" Big mistake. Lewis' latest book is interesting, informative, and eerie - more on the 'eerie' part later. He tells the story of how several independent thinkers - a neurosurgeon with Asperger's syndrome who quit his specialty training to become a full-time mortgage-bond trader, a self-described Republican professional trader who turned socialist after becoming convinced the entire consumer finance industry was a rip-off, and a small hedge fund started with $110,000 and two-people's realization that the market significantly underestimated the likelihood of 'Black swan' events.<br /><br />Lewis begins with a short background, which I've augmented here via Wikipedia. The big fear of the 1980s mortgage bond investor was that he would be repaid too quickly, not that he wouldn't be repaid at all. Salomon Brothers then invented a solution - giant mortgage pools carved up into tranches, with buyers of the first tranche getting hit with the first wave of prepayments in exchange for a higher interest rate. This approach was then extended to non-guaranteed loans, seasoned with the moral risk created by lenders selling rather than holding those loans, as well as a strong mixture of wishful accounting and the alchemy of tranching that allowed everyone to assume almost all the loans would be repaid. It was 1997, and 65% of the $60 billion in subprime loans were fixed-rate.<br /><br />Changes, however, were underway. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 lifted the $125,000 capital-gains exclusion to $500,000, encouraging Americans to get into investment properties. The following year brought home price appreciation of 10+% in West Coast areas, and a Federal Reserve Bank arranged the rescue of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund that renewed investors' faith that they'd be bailed out by either the 'Greenspan put' or the new doctrine of 'too big to fail.' The year 2000 added HUD's requiring Fannie Mae to substantially boost low-income mortgage lending (reinforced by Bush II in 2002), and the dot-com crash brought sustained low interest rates. That year saw $130 billion in subprime mortgage lending. In 2004, the percentage of interest-only, 'no-doc' loans began growing, and the ratio of median home prices/income had risen from its historical 3:1 level to 4:1; later it would hit 10:1 in the West and 8.5 in Miami. By 2005, 75% of sub-prime loans were floating rate, usually after a two-year 'teaser' rate, and volume was up to $625 billion. Initial rates were typically 8%, rising to 12%; amazingly, these did not receive lower security ratings.<br /><br />Historically, those believing market values were too high would short the particular stock. Lewis' protagonists, however, realized that buying the insurance provided by credit-default swaps (CDS) offered a safer way - limited losses and high leverage. In 2005, the CDS market hardly existed - by 2008 they were a trillion-dollar market. AIG originated the market, offering AAA-rated subprime CDS for 0.12%/year. The assumption was that there was little correlation (.30) between mortgages in a mortgage bond - that correlation turned out to be closer to 1.0 and was a major error for many. After selling about $50 billion in CDS, AIG stopped selling new ones, but inexplicably continued to renew the ones it already had. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, Wachovia, and a few others then filled the demand. Lewis' investors looked for CDS on synthetic CDOs made of repackaged lowest-level mortgage-bond tranches; the more 'silent seconds,' thin-file,' high-variance FICO 615 scores the better. ('Thin-file' credit records represented individuals with no credit lapses because they had no credit; average FICO scores had to be at least 615 to qualify as 'investment-grade' - however, those with a mixture of high and low scores averaging 615 were likely to experience higher default rates thanthose with just scores near 615. Example of an approved loan - a $14,000/year strawberry picker with no credit history given a $745,000 mortgage.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lewis' investors couldn't believe what they were seeing - the opportunity to short mortgages seemed too good to be true. They constantly studied the market, went to conferences, and challenged the thinking of those more optimistic. In January, 2007 the common assumption was that default rates on these mortgages would approximate 5%; nine months later brought 30+% losses. They also became frustrated by the increasing difficulty of finding underpriced CDS to buy, so they switched to shorting investment banks and bond-rating firms. Finally, there was also the worry AIG, Goldman, Wachovia, etc. would be unable to pay off, and the possibility the government would step in and bail out the homeowners. Meanwhile, the ratings agencies sensed something was wrong as well, and brought out a new rating model for new mortgage bonds etc., but refused to re-rate the $2 trillion that had already gone through. Ultimately they sold their CDS prior to maturity to minimize the risk of seller default, while still managing to make very large profits.<br /><br />At the end, Lewis points out that most of the important people on both sides of the gamble got rich, even those who lost billions of other people's money. Lewis believes that the risks taken would never have happened if the investment banks had still been employee-owned. He was also a bit flustered by the government stepping in to bail out the firms that had made dumb bets instead of the subprime borrowers themselves.<br /><br />\\"The Big Short\\" was interesting and informational; however, it created an eerie foreboding as well. I was struck by how similar his story of general optimism in the face of unsustainable trends is to today. Excited empty heads on CNBC, CNN and Fox business programs ballyhooing most every trend and tidbit, despite ballooning trade ($9.2+ trillion), federal and state ($16 trillion), and homeowner debts ($17 trillion), as well as massive unfunded health obligations ($56 trillion), and a grossly overextended military. Inflation-adjusted incomes are stagnating and sagging, despite being temporarily propped up by deficits and wasteful government, education, and health care spending; meanwhile, complacent government and business leaders continue support for unrestricted free trade despite predictions that massive job losses will spread from basic and medium-technology manufacturing to high-technology, renewable energy, R&D, and up to 40% of the service industry.<br /><br />Two sectors are particularly vulnerable within our faltering economy - college/university education, and health care. Mark Taylor of Columbia projects education at a top-tier school will cost $330,000 in 2020 if trends continue. Yet, American universities (eg. Columbia and N.Y.U.) have already announced billion-dollar expansions and renovations (New York Times, 8/14/2010), while bachelor's-level graduates have increasing difficulty finding jobs requiring that education (51%, down from 59% in 2000).  Worse yet, an estimated 2 million of their Chinese counterparts are also unable to find jobs, many living in $51/month 21.5 square-feet 'boxes.' President Obama is calling for five million additional graduates in the next decade - What future employment will allow them to pay for their education? Similarly, America's health care, already the world's most expensive, is projected to reach 20% of GDP in 2017 by one estimate.

142313494X|5.0|I checked out this book from the library because I just wanted to read a fun book and take a break from heavy duty texts. This book was the perfect fit, and I just couldn't put it down. Of course, the similarities to Harry Potter are there, but the story is very original. All the characters are witty and funny, but they can be serious when necessary. Most impressive is Riordan's presentation of the gods. All the Olympians presented in the first book contain that enigmatic quality associated with myths. This is a great way to learn about mythology and the beauty of the story is that it parallels how Western civilization is based on Greek thoughts and philosophies. The best part is that it's an easy and satisfying read, and definitely a good break from the sometimes too emotional Potter fare. (I love HP by the way, but it can get too much at times especially all the deaths).
B003Y3UNZW|5.0|This is an awesome summer filled album. Her first album was great but this one is by far the better one. She has a great voice and the songs are fun and full of energy.

B0000C172X|5.0|\\"On the Beach\\"  was  Neil Young's 5th studio album, originally released in 1974. The reviewed version was re-released as a remastered  HDCD/DVD version in 2003. Some have complained about the technical aspects of the album (it plays fine on my system), but the real focus should be on the music.    \\"On the Beach\\" was initially panned by many critics as being overly pessimistic and spare. It then lived the life of a cult-favorite (I still have the 8 track!). In retrospect, Neil's genius and ability to span genres is evident. The opening track, \\"Walk On,\\"   displays that authentic, spare sound that was the key to Young in the day. He dabbles with country-rock in \\"See the Sky About to Rain\\" and turns a harder turn in \\"Revolution Blues.\\"  In the following track, \\"For the Turnstiles\\" we can hear one of Neil's banjo jams, with tight harmonies and great lyrics: \\"though your confidence may be shattered, it doesn't matter.\\"     \\"Vampire Blues\\" is just fun: \\"sucking blood from the earth!\\" and is followed by the title track \\"On the Beach\\" which may in fact be the weakest cut on the album. He makes up for it (and more) in \\"Motion Pictures,\\"  a dreamy solo. The last track, \\"Ambulance Blues\\" may be known more widely as \\"Proud Isabella,\\" and is a great example of Young's  ability to disparage those with who he was having \\"emotional issues:\\"  \\"you're only real with your makeup on.\\"    Fans of Young cannot overlook this album. It's essential Neil.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|*******Contains Spoilers*******<br />My Name is Khan is clearly one of the best films I've seen this year.  Period.  The performances by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are stellar and if there is any justice the film should at least receive an Oscar nod as Best Foreign Film.<br /><br />But I want to touch upon the notion that several reviewers have mentioned that the scenes in Georgia were unnecessary.  I disagree.  Those scenes were there to emphasize that Rizwan completely adhered to the lesson that his mother taught him that there were only two kinds of people in the world; good and bad.  To the point of setting his own personal journey aside, he felt to need to help \\"good\\" people that were in trouble.  How could we capture that notion any better than having him come to the aid of another group of people that were be subjected to the discrimination that he was feeling?<br /><br />Is some of it over the top and/or unrealistic?  No more than the action film characters that survive exploding cars and jumps from rooftops with little or no harm to their bodies.  It's a movie, people.<br /><br />All films paint certain characters with broad strokes to move the story along.  Most of those stereotypical characters are based on some exaggeration of the truth.  I am an African American woman who like Mama Jenny is a \\"little fat\\".  I was not offended by anything in the movie at all.  She was portrayed as a caring and warm person.  And anyone that thinks that areas like that don't exist in American anymore have not traveled off of the main roads.  People are forgetting that the main character has Asperger's.  His description of Joel and his hair is something an autistic person may say.  My nephew is autistic.  He is very literal with observations. He doesn't think about the political correctness of his statement before he speaks. But again, it is a movie, people.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the one I have with all Hindi movies that portray Americans.  I can always tell that they are British actors.  There were two actors I immediately recognized from US TV shows; Tonya Lee Williams as the African American newscaster and Christopher B. Duncan as President Obama.  But Tonya is actually British too.  The actress playing Mama Jenny, Jennifer Echols, has made many appearances on TV; Dexter, ER, The Shield, Nip/Tuck, My Name is Earl, etc.  And the kid playing Joel, Adrian Kali Turner, has been on Chuck, Numb3rs, Flashforward and iCarly.  So, it looks like they went with American actors for the most of the African American characters at least.<br /><br />My minor complaint aside, this film is well worth the time spent.  Great job by everyone involved.  Great message if you are willing to listen.ere were two actors I immediately recognized from US TV shows; Tonya Lee Williams as the African American newscaster and Christopher B.

B001RXB4FY|5.0|In all honesty I am here because I found these guys just this very morning. I had my first taste of Volbeat's \\"Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil\\" while overseas on patrol. Music tends to get a bit old here...fast. I could only have taken a few more 5 Finger Death Punch and Metallica songs before I had gone completely bananas, and all of a sudden...     My buddy plugs in the Ipod to some mobile speakers. \\"A Moment Forever\\" plays, as it rolls into \\"Soulweeper\\" and I'm smitten silly. I literally and quite completely forget what I was doing because like all great things, I tend to wonder where the hell I'd been all this time. He then switches albums to \\"Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood\\" and we roll back to base listening to \\"Light the Way\\", \\"Wild Rover of Hell\\" and \\"I'm So Lonely I could Cry\\"...ah man, it's was simply one of those moments where everything is happening just right.     This is the caliber of music that makes you want to punch a stranger in the face and ask them \\"Who are these guys?! Tell me!\\" I had to know more. As soon as I got back and had some time, I was all over the web checking out videos, youtube, Myspace, you name it. For being such an outstanding music experience, I was wondering why I had only heard a few songs on Sirius Radio up to this point. It's good to know that these guys guys from Denmark are now touring the states with the likes of Metallica. This is great news.    I understand we all have different music tastes, and if you're reading these commentaries for an honest opinion, I'm gonna cut the bull and just say you should buy this. I am here, ordering the last three albums, writing a very positive review on what I've experienced this day. Give it a listen. VOLBEAT WILL NOT DISSAPOINT. 5 SOLID STARS.
B0036EH3WK|1.0|I watched this show for six years expecting to get answers to all of the ridiculous questions raised during the run of the show, so when I saw the two and a half hour finale wind down to nothing with pretty much nothing explained, I was pissed. I never would have watched this show had I known the ending would be such a cop out. The writers string you along with strange things, hinting at explanations, but really they had no idea how to explain all of the nonsense that they wrote. A truly great show would have ended with a finale that is complete, makes sense, and makes you see things in a whole new light every time you rewatch the earlier episodes. This entire show was a gamble - a dare to see how far out on the ledge could they go without falling down or tripping over themselves. They failed.

I'm not into class room yoga because I always feel rushed in and out of poses.  I was always looking for a new yoga book that would actually have some nicely thought out Asana sequences.  This is it!  I bought this book about a year and a half ago, it is my bible.    Clear instructions about breathing during movements, where to focus your attention. Finding flexibility and peace of mind through subtle poses.  I would recommend this book to anyone at any level of yoga practice.    have fun!

B001R4SYPG|4.0|Riley needs no introduction, and \\"In C\\" needs neither introduction nor advocacy. Composed in 1964, it is the composition that invented - or so many say, but not Riley, who has always paid tribute to LaMonte Young for being the mastermind of all of it - what has come to be known as \\"minimalism\\", but what I prefer to call \\"repetitive music\\", or \\"repetitive minimalism\\": it may be based on the repetition of minimal cells, but the result can be all but \\"minimal\\", as illustrated by In C.    The score - reproduced on the original LP and here again, although the choice of white print on black surface and the CD-booklet size make it more an image to contemplate than a score to read - is little more than a canvass, consisting indeed of 53 small melodic cells, some limited to three notes/two pitches. There is an additional pitch not represented in the score, called \\"the pulse\\": a piano playing a constant 8th-notes, fast tempo ostinato toll of two octave high-Cs. It starts and ends the piece, bare. The principle of the composition is to have any number of any instruments, each playing each of the 53 cells in succession (but some may be omitted), each moving to the next ad lib, though with relative synchronisation with all the rest: the rule here is that there should be no more than five cells distance between any player. The effect, in Riley's own words, is like \\"lying in a field, and there are cloud formations just passing over, and you're just watching them form and reform\\".    As many have remarked, though the harmonic basis in C, in moves through various related tonalities.    This recording premiere was made in 1968, following shortly the New York Premiere at Carnegie Hall on December 19,1967 (concert poster nicely reproduced in the booklet), and three years after the premiere in San Francisco, an event which seems to have had no immediate consequence. In C can and has subsequently been played by a vast array of different ensembles, including percussion ([[ASIN:B000006NYKIn C]]), voices ([[ASIN:B000KJTPY8 Riley: In C]]) and traditional Chinese instruments ([[ASIN:B0000007WF Terry Riley: In C; Liang: Music of a Thousand Springs; Zen (Ch'an) of Water]]). Here, Riley used an ensemble of 11 players (including himself) from the Creative and Performing Arts in Buffalo's New York State University, strongly slanted in the direction of winds and brass: flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone (played by Riley), bassoon, trumpet, trombone, viola, vibraphone, marimbaphone and, of course, piano/pulse. Two overdubs were added (the second sparingly), first using ten musicians and seven in the second, so that the maximum instrumental layout on the reording consists of 28 instruments. Performance duration is aleatoric, of course; here, the performance was made long enough and kept short enough to fit on an LP - which is short for a CD: 42 minutes. Other recorded performances range from 20 minutes to 76 - the longest being two recordings again conducted by Riley himself, [[ASIN:B000000R3V Riley: In C (25th Anniversary Concert)]] and [[ASIN:B000F8EVDO Terry Riley Repititition Orchestra]], recorded live in Moscow in 2000 by the... well, why don't you look for yourselves, there is a typo in the disc's listing, but not the one you think (and I think the Terri Rajli given as \\"author\\" is a hilarious phonetic transcription of Terry Riley with a Russian accent; I will NOT try and update the product info on these two).    For a number of decades of music listening I managed to escape \\"in C\\" - probably on account of my feeling of deception upon hearing Reich's \\"Music for 18 musicians\\". I've never had the original LP, nor the earlier CD reissues, so I can't assess the merits of this new remastering, but it was done by \\"perhaps the finest of all mastering engineers, Bob Ludwig\\", and it sounds as if it had been recorded yesterday. So this is now obviously the version to start with.    Whether you enjoy the music or not is going to be a matter of taste - I can't say I amentirely bowled over: I must confess that I find it somewhat grey and dry in tone color and melodic outlook, and I've found the music of Dutch composer Simeon Ten Holt significantly more colorful (even though it is scored for piano ensemble only) and entertaining, with more catching and hypnotic tunes ([[ASIN:B000F0H4KY Simeon ten Holt: Complete Multiple Piano Works [Box Set]]]), although I recognize that it is derivative of what Riley invented. But my reaction to this particular recording also has to do with the instrumental ensemble chosen by Reich. I've just heard the version played on seven keyboards (including Rhodes piano, two harpsichords and vibraphone) by Piano Circus, [[ASIN:B000004131 Steve Reich: Six Pianos; Terry Riley: In C]], and I find that it has more sparkle and joy, thanks to the keyboards' sharper edges. But the historical importance and seminal nature of In C, and of this particular recording, cannot be under-estimated. This is where it all started, so this is where anybody should start. This is not just entertaining, it is history. And the good thing is: it is not just history, it is also entertaining.    Excellent and thorough liner notes. We get both those of the original LP and new ones, with reminiscences from the original performers.

1416972250|5.0|I finished City of Glass and I have to say that The Mortal Instruments is one of the best series I have ever read. City of Bones crushed me a little with the news that Clary and Jace were really brother and sister. I was stubborn though and I refused to believe it. I immediately ran over to pick up City of Ashes. City of Ashes was even more exciting then the first book in the series. It was in that book that I realized why everybody is always raving about Magnus Bane. He is a very....sparkly character. I of course was also driven crazy by the end of that book when Jace \\"lies\\" to Clary and says he will just be her brother from now on...You are killing me Cassandra Clare!    City of Glass picks up right after City of Ashes. Clary's mother is still in her magically induced coma but now, thanks to Madeline, Clary knows how to save her and the only one who can help her is in Idris. The reader hears a lot about Idris in the previous books but we are never really introduces to it until this book. Despite Clary's reasons for wanting to go to Idris Jace is determined to prevent her from going. Jace fears that Clary's heightened Shadowhunter abilities will make her desired by the Clave. After an unexpected demon attack Jace manages to succeed in leaving Clary behind but ends up bringing Simon with instead. Let's just say that the new Inquisitor is not too pleased to see a vampire come through the portal and he has some plans for Simon.    Jace may have succeeded initially but Clary being the determined person she is creates her own portal and ends up in Idris with Luke anyways. Shortly after arriving in Idris Clary meets a new tall dark haired boy who seems strangely familiar. Sebastian quickly offers to help Clary in her pursuit for the warlock who can help her cure her mother. Valentine is still moving forward with his plans to attack the Clave and Idris. He has the sword and the cup and now he just needs the mirror. The only way to defeat his demon army may be for Shadowhunters and Downworlders to work together. Putting aside there differences and petty jealousies may prove to be impossible. Only Clary seems to hold the key to uniting them against Valentine.     City of Glass is action packed and laced with declarations of love *squeal*. I can't wait to continue this series with City of Fallen Angels which is scheduled to release April 5, 2011. At least I will have Clockwork Angel to tide me over in the meantime and I only have to wait 2 more weeks for it!
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian's \\"Reimagines\\" was what I expected from one of the great composer/writers of my generation.  The harmonies and the feeling that he brings to his music have no equal. My grandchildren will be dancing to this one!  Thank you, Mr.Wilson, the Gershwins must be proud.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is pure genius. She knows what real dance music is and she brings it with this album. The songs are very catchy. There has never been an artist where I loved every single one of their songs. She doesn't make her voice sound fake with autotune like Ke$ha, which is great because she can show off her real talent. I love every song so much.
B003O86CJS|4.0|After her hit debut album 'One of the Boys', Katy Perry's sophomore album really delivers. The songs 'California Gurls' and 'Teenage Dream' are already smash hits. The album has a great 90's summer vibe and the beats are are strong and catchy.  If you loved her first album, you surely wont be disappointed with this strong release.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy Perry had a great debut album but her second record is even better. Her new look is great and this album is fun and these songs are very pumped up with energetic pop dance songs. Very catchy.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I remembered seeing this movie on PBS. But I only saw bits and parts of it. And from what I saw I really liked it. Picked it up from the library to make sure it was the right one and to see if it was the best one. And it was. I really like this movie. I have watched this movie over and over. It is the closest one to the book. Not everything is exact to the book, but pretty close. Very rarely when you watch a movie after reading the book that the movie is exact to the book. I found that this movie did a good job. I liked the actors I think they did a good job with that. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Jane Austen or loves romance movies.

0525951652|5.0|See book summaries above.<br />With his previous epics, Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, Ken Follett has become one<br />of my favorite authors alive today. Pillars has been on my number 1 spot as a favorite novel since it came<br />out years ago.<br />With Fall of Giants he's done it again. I can use all the cliches taken from good book reviews, such as 'hard<br />to put down' and 'totally engrossing' and they would be  completely appropriate. It really amazes me<br />how Mr. Follett can write such huge novels and keep the reader totally enthralled.<br />Great entertainment and great writing.
B0029RQE84|5.0|To say that Mark Knopfler is the ultimate musician is an understatement. His playing is superb, his writing of lyrics is sensitive and poignant, and the humility he conveys in person is so obvious. I have not been privileged enough to see him in person , but have seen videos and u-tube performances and he touches one's soul deeply. The recording I recently purchased ,\\"Get Lucky\\" is a wonderful addition to my MK library. His originality astounds me and the quality of sound is exceptional. I understand it was recorded in his own studio which must be of the highest quality. Thank you for providing this treasure to me.
B003SNJZ3Y|3.0|Not sure why others are fawning over this book. Mallaby spends 90% of the book detailing 12 or so of the most famous hedge fund operators and how they amassed their fortunes. While their stories are interesting, they have been well-told and are available in simple internet searches. I didn't feel Mallaby was bringing any new information to light.    The author does touch on all the salient points as to why hedge funds are not evil (as the press would have you believe). Still, I was hoping for more from this book than just a history lesson on the industry's most famous participants.

B0036EH3WK|3.0|first season was tops, 2004 was a good year in general for story telling even though writer's guild was still on strike.  Abrams sort of is a kid and well, gets carried away after seasaon three.  First off, they're are far far FAR to many NEW characters that keep popping up like Muppets in a \\"capor\\" from Under Jim henson's table, every season.  I liked the first batch, with Sayide, Lock, Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and co. liked all of them. and I'm not going to sit here and even list every first wave's name either,(Jin, Sun, Charlie, Hurley, his \\"brother in arms\\"lol, Claire, miss her!, Ben, and Walt  and the summer locked chic and her metrosexual brother too.(miss her too he was a good actor anyway) the stories from that era were gripping, the best ever told! But later(post 2006 though intro of newbees was annoying even then) it was sloppy and like everything on TV, Sawyer was a woose, Kate was his boss, Jack was, well, a Jerk, Loch was getting silly so on.  And above all, I(and other audiences) were slowly then totally by 2008 loosing interest, I once eagerly awiated a season's closing/opening but lately when I am called by a friend/relative and they say \\"Hey lost is on, wanna watch\\" I am not even interested enough to turn on the boob tube, I instead play \\"Far Cry\\" a game ten times better than the new plots of lost. HA!  The writing of Abrams, once was excellent, now noting but what everyone does, he has \\"gone to pot\\", you might say and it shows in \\"Star Trek\\" The movie, what a lame!  As a capeable writer, his \\"distributers\\" may have had a hand in \\"telling him\\" what to write, I don't know, same unfortunate fated \\"accident' happend to John Maxell Anderson's many flop's in the '80's like \\"The Cosby Show\\" and \\"Family Ties\\" as well as \\"Diffrent Strokes\\" going from funny and \\"cute\\" to stupid and lame with formulatic \\"puns\\" nobody truely cared about or they were lying to themselves if they did!  I cannot imagine a writer thinking he can get by with introducing (regulars) on a regular basis for too late in the show.  In novel writing and that goes for scripts it is stated one must NEVER introduce a \\"new\\" protag after about half of the book.  College Writing.  Because, put simply, it distracts the audience from what they are used too. stunns them then when they get \\"warmmed up\\" to a \\"newbie\\" you go and dump the hind quarter of the plane on them! and abandon Jack Kate, Lock, ect. and that's stupid and unrealatable! anyone with a different \\"opinion\\" an keep it to themselves I could care less. I did like season One and most of '04.egular basis for too late in the show.

0439023513|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy has utterly captivated me. Since I read the first page of the first book I have been hooked. The end was no dissapointment, and exceeded my expectations which were already high.    Mockingjay is brilliantly written. And has captured what the other two have as well, a sense of reality. We do not have the technology they have or their government, but the sheer cruelty in the books is all to real. Collins writes masterfully, the insight into Katniss' head makes you feel as if you are right there in the battle with her. The Games are still present in this book though not in the way they were in the other two.     It is not a happy fairy tale story, and it never has been. The Hunger Games is gritty and all-too frightening because it shows a glimpse of what we could be and are becoming. All of my questions were answered. The Peeta-Gale issue is resolved. I truly felt sorry for Katniss and everything she has gone through.    The book is full of action. Collins takes us from a bloddy arena in the previous books to a war-zone. She gives us the complexities of human nature, and shows that not everything is black and white. The good guys can make terrible choices and not all the bad guys are completely heartless. The Gale and Peeta dilema is heartbreaking and at times it seems impossible for Katniss to have either.     I admire Susanne Collins for not wrapping up everything in a pretty little bow. It is what makes this book, this series, so powerful. In life not everyone gets a happy ending. Not every boy gets the girl. Not everyone survives in a war. In short Mockingjay is heartbreaking and terrifying, a book that makes you want to fight for a cause and curl up in a ball and cry. And I would recomend reading it every single time. This series will always be one of my favorites.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|I loved this cd/dvd. the cd was her best ever, every track a HIT.... the dvd was great  too, always puts on a great concert!!!!! I recommend this combo to all her fans......
B002ZG98LO|1.0|Predator from 1987 is a solid movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jessie Ventura, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke & Carl Weathers. I could quote a lot of lines from that movie I've loved it since I saw it on TV back in 1996. Great SCI FI action slasher film. Predator 2 is a good sequel has a fairly fast pace great lead in Danny Glover good supporting cast in Maria Conchita Alanso Ruben Blade Bill Paxton. Good villain in Gary Buesy of course Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator in both movies. I like Predator 2 it's not as good as Predator 1 but it comes pretty close. The 2 Alien vs Predator movies I hate them they killed both franchises beyond repair. So those would movies were so bad that fans would take anything. 20th Century FOX they had to save this franchise. Predators directed by Nimrod Antal he directed Armored. Robert Rodriguez produced but wasn't able to direct it stars Adiren Brody as Royce, Topher Grace as Edwin 2 mother f*ç**rs that have no business in a Predator movie Alice Braga as Isabelle, Laurance Fishburne as Noland for about 10 minutes Danny Trejo as Cuchillo. Most of the casting turned me off then I saw a trailer TV spots stuff on the internet I was relieved thinking it wasn't going to be so bad. The reviews were mixed some liked it some said that it was better than the original some hated it others said it was the sequel Predator deserved. I have to agree on with the negitive reviews it's forgettable boring bland not even somewhat half way watchable. Movie stars off Adiren Brody falling from the sky Predators have a game reserve they take the best from Earth to hunt them I'm thinking why? Wouldn't they just do that on Earth it makes no sense. Why is Royce taking charge? So our Dutch knock off Christan Bale want to be Royce runs into Cuchillo Isabelle some black guy you know is going to die cause this movie keeps up with the tadition all minorities die 1st if you wouldn've made him the black comic relief guy cliches would be down pat. Also some Death Row Inmate I could care less about Yakuza guy then Edwin the thing is every Predator movie after Predator 2 the Honor Code remember \\"No sport!\\" From Predator remembered Leona in part 2 Predator was going to kill her he saw that she was pregnant & didn't kill her. You had Death Row Inmate I could care less about armed with knifes how the h3** is that sporty. Cuchillo is killed so is random black guy I can't remember how. Oh our cookie cutter characters fight some God awful CGI Predator dogs they didn't need dogs in part 1 part 2 or the AVP films they were killing MF ers. I think I saw a bird Predator too don't tell me that was in comic books I don't give $**t! BTW what happend to The Predators saw disc & spear at least AvP & AVPR had them. I don't remember a lot & I just saw it. A guy named Noland shows up he's been surviving for 10 years & well he tries to gas our \\"heroes\\" & take there weaponsas he runs away he's killed by a Predator not before standing there like an idiot saying why did it take you so long. Death Row Inmate I care about is killed Yakuza guy is killed I think I don't remember how he died Edwin shows his true colors turns on Isabelle & he's a serial killer WOW! I knew that 8 months before the movie came out! Royce fights The Predator in an almost shot for shot fight of The Dutch & Predator fight from  part 1. Isabelle shoots thd Predator in the head Dutch I mean Royce hacks him up with something & I spoiled it cause this was a awful movie. Arnold & Danny Glover didn't need a girl to help them. That's another thing lets not give Danny Glover the pass a guy who was credible to me cause he was in the Lethal Weapon flicks but let's give Adrien Brody from The Pianist & King Kong 2005 the pass. To me Danny Glover circa 1990 could kick Adrien Brody's @**. & I could think of a lot more people that are more qualified to play the lead than Adrien Brody. Murtough needs to revoke Brody & Topher Grace's SAG cards. Why I think he's a Christan Bale want to be is he uses a30 year chain smoker voice & trys to hard to be tough. Topher Grace your TV actor at best you were awful in Spider Man 3 you were pathetic here too. The only good things were the score, creature effects & Laurance Fishburne's ghead getting blown off. If the AVP movies were never made & this was Predator 3 I feel everybody would fee the same way. Then I've heard it's better than the AVP movies Crow Salvation, Crow Wicked Prayer, Street Fighter 94, Robocop 3 Johnny Nuemonic T3 MK Annihilation Halloween Resurrection Freddy's Dead are all better than AVP 1-2 doesn't take much nothing to hang your hat on. If you like Predators that's fine just don't leave any negitive comments. Predators the sequel Predator deserved I think not.
0061122416|2.0|Oddly enough, this book doesn't say anything deep or meaningful that we haven't already heard before.  While the message may be a good one, it's obvious, everyone knows it, and ultimately I was asking myself...  what's the point?  Also, it's like one long lecture rather than a story.  So if you're looking for plot or adventure - steer clear.    The good news is that it's short, so it won't waste too much of your time.  I'm aware that many people were touched by this work.  All I can say is \\"good for them.\\"  I wish I knew what I was missing.
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I have been an avid Predator fan since the Governor of California first tangled with one in the jungles back in 1987.  I wasn't swayed a few years later when the black cop from Lethal Weapon took one of the same alien species out amidst gang warfare in a (then) futuristic Los Angeles.  I stuck with it even through the AVP disaster (redeemed slightly by the second effort).  Naturally, it was with extreme trepidation that I went into Predators; first showing on opening day.  Robert Rodriguez's past film efforts coupled to some pretty tantalizing trailers was enough to put Paul WS Anderson's folly aside.  Now that the material has had a few hours to settle in, I can state that the piece lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />To clear the air right from the get-go, this is perhaps the theoretical sequel fans of the original have been waiting 23 years for.  In fact, one of my few complaints is that the picture comes dangerously close to emulating the first film in multiple occasions.  On the whole, there are enough diversions and new concepts presented to dismiss fears of it simply being a \\"redo\\", but Rodriguez very well may have studied the original a bit too closely in his pre-production inspiration.  More on that later.<br /><br />That said the film opens in an undisclosed time period but presumably present day based on some of the dialog shared throughout the movie and it does so with alarming efficiency; namely in the form of Adrien Brody's character plummeting toward the jungle from the stratosphere.  He, along with several other humans, land within the very Earthen-like jungle only to slowly discover that they had been abducted from their daily lives and apparently deposited on some alien world.<br /><br />In keeping with the Predator franchise's mythos, they are allotted weapons ranging from machine guns to pocketknives to aid them in their mission; in this case simply surviving.<br /><br />I mentioned similarities to the original and right from the onset there are many! From the obvious jungle setting once again to the Gatling gun being used to clear foliage, on down to moments like a very warthog like alien being stabbed in the chest with a straight blade, a human-built net trap complete with swinging log, and an accidental tumble while being pursued by the Predator off a cliff into a quick moving river/ waterfall.  There's even a moment where the \\"insightful guy\\" decides he has run long enough from the mysterious predators and turns back from the group in effort to challenge their pursuer with nothing more than a sword. Combine these onscreen moments with a John Debney score that was deliberately designed to mimic Alan Silvestri's (who was busy scoring The A-Team) work on the original 1987 film and it becomes easy to experience a little d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  Now that I think about it, even the ending credits roll to \\"Long Tall Sally\\" once more.<br /><br />The film's structure is similar to the original as well with a slow building methodical first half linked to a fairly action-packed conclusion.  And none of these revelations are mere conjecture as when asked where he drew inspiration for how to make this film, Robert Rodriguez was quoted as saying he was inspired what to do from the original Predator, and what not to do by Predator 2 and both AVP efforts. Interestingly he also went on to say that he drew no inspiration whatsoever from the Predator comics.<br /><br />The piece, which was shot in a fairly brisk 53-day span, introduces Adrien Brody in his first appearance as a genuine tough-guy and to answer the immediate question, yes he pulls it off for the most part.  Taking a cue from Christian Bale's vocal performance as Batman, Brody delivers a forceful (if forced) gruff snarl that makes up for his lack of physical proportions typically considered requisite for the role.  The remaining cast is solid as well, with nothing extraordinary to report but no glaring flaws/ miscasts to complain about either.  Alice Bragacontinues the tradition of casting a Latin lead actress in the film and this is further cemented by the fact that Rodriquez himself has stated that the project is intended to be a part of the Predator franchise (making it Predator 3 by definition) and not a part of the AVP mythos which breaks this tradition.<br /><br />Effects are truly spectacular this time around; not that the earlier entries ever had much to complain about, it was nice to see Predators that didn't rely simply on their high-tech weaponry as a means of eliminating their prey.  Sure the shoulder-mount plasma guns are back as are the twin forearm razors but spears, whips, and boomerang-like fist-blades don't make an appearance here.  Additionally, and it is yet to be seen whether the community at large will accept this one as part of the mythos, Rodriguez plays around a little bit with the Predator culture by introducing two different sects of Predators that are apparently quite un-fond of one another (quite a diversion from all of the past entries which showed definite camaraderie between the creatures).<br /><br />And rest easy those who fear this as being the first of the 5 pictures featuring these costumes to fail to up the \\"ugly\\" factor of the unmasked aliens; the bar is raised once again with the addition of the superior of the two Predator species!<br /><br />In all, Predators succeeds on many of the fundamental levels of suspense, action, horror and sheer nastiness that has elevated the first film to near legendary status while introducing enough uniqueness to prevent the experience from feeling like a carbon copy.  I was particularly impressed with the explanation presented for alien abduction/ human disappearance here on Earth.  The final homage is that events of the first film are actually referenced in the dialog but, and despite being acknowledged as a legitimate part of the franchise, events of the second film are not mentioned (which obsessed fans may take to mean this film is in fact set some time between 1987 (Predator 1) and 1997 (the setting for Predator 2).<br /><br />Fans of the original will surely delight in Rodriguez's debut stab at the material and those of us who have found something to enjoy in all of the incarnations thus far will be especially impressed with where he has taken the franchise.the film and this is further cemented by the fact that Rodriquez himself has stated that the project is intended to be a part of the Predator franchise (making it Predator 3 by definition) and not a part of the AVP mythos which breaks this tradition.

B00004TS0E|1.0|When you have been alive as long as I have, you start to notice a thing or two about hollywood. Those hollywood executives love making remakes of movies. this has been the same since I was a young lad all those years ago. Cary Grant made a couple of remakes that my papa hated.    I get his hatred now. When a movie is remade, we judge it differently from a normal movie. A remake needs to get the spirit of the original. This is the only goal the remake needs to have. The remake of Miracle on 34th Street missed it.    The Miracle in the original movie was the federal government coming to the rescue. There wasn't a miracle in the remake. The miracle was the belief of a little child and the evil manipulations of an old man who tricked two people to get married and forget to use protection. The movie showed that in a childlike way, but hollywood missed it. The miracle that was in the original was not there in the remake. No miracle at all.    The extras in the dvd wasn't worth the price of the dvd. I would have liked to see some storyboards or explanations why hollywood did what they did to this movie.

0375842381|2.0|OK, so my kid is reading the trilogy, and keeps insisting that I read it too. So I picked up the first book.    Book 1 is GREAT. It ends in a cliffhanger.  Book 2 is pretty good. It never resolves the cliffhanger, just makes the cliff higher and the hang-iness more suspenseful.    Then comes Book 3 -- long, confusing, and MISSING THE CRITICAL PAGES THAT PRESUMABLY RESOLVE THE CLIFFHANGER FROM BOOKS 1 & 2.    So I read over 1,000 pages and get ... no satisfaction...
B00000255F|5.0|Happy 40th birthday, &#34;Born To Run&#34; by &#34;The Boss&#34; Mr. Bruce Springsteen.  It was released August 25,1975.<br />After 2 moderate selling albums &#34;Greetings&#34; #60 and &#34;Innocent&#34; #59, this record surprised everybody, the hooks and the anthems were everywhere.  Led by the new E-Street Band, Roy Bittan, Clarence &#34;Big Man&#34; Clemons, Danny Federici,Gerry Tallent, Stevie Van Zandt and Max Weinberg, Bruce and the boys would have 8 songs that still get played in concerts today.  With classic rockers like the hit title track #23, &#34;Thunder Road&#34;, &#34;She's the One&#34;, &#34;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&#34; #83 and &#34;Night&#34;, and the classic anthems &#34;Jungleland&#34; and &#34;Backstreets&#34;. And the pensive ballad &#34;Meeting Across The River&#34;.  &#34;Born to Run&#34; hit #3 in the charts and they have never looked back.  Saw  Bruce perform the &#34;Born To Run&#34; album in St.Louis on his last tour, Awesome!  Again Happy Birthday &#34;Born To Run&#34; 40 years old, today.  One of rock's classic covers.
0805091742|2.0|Save your money and time - you don't need to read this book.  The premise is simple - checklists help reduce errors in complex tasks.  The author then wastes your time telling stories about how different industries use checklists and lo and behold it reduces errors.  The author makes a good point and this simple idea is helpful and can be used across more professions, but this should have been a 20 page e-book, not a full length book.
B000NJVWU0|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's 4th studio album, \\"EVE\\" #13 in 1979 was a big improvement over their last album \\"Pyramid\\".  With the lead off instrumental \\"Lucifer\\", with some great keyboards by Duncan Mackay and orchestration by Andrew Powell, Alan played on this track, autoharp,drum machine and fx compilation. (he rarely played on the albums). A hit in Europe.  The rocker \\"You Lie Down With Dogs\\", with the barking(pun) vocals of Lenny Zakatek. The synth driven \\"I'd Rather Be A Man\\", with vocals by ex-Pilot singer David Paton. The acoustic laden ballad \\"You Won't Be There\\", followed by what I think should of given more airplay \\"Winding Me Up\\", just a terrific pop-rock song , with great orchestration and vocals by Chris Rainbow. (reminds me of ELO here).  The big hit on the album \\"Damned If I Do\\" #26, again Lenny's vocals steal the show. Just a great song, that doesn't get enough credit, the keyboards by Duncan Mackay at the beginning of the song is what I love most.  \\"Don't Hold Back\\", sung by a female vocalist for the first time (on a APP album) Clare Torry, a nice little pop number.  The Beach Boy harmonies of Chris Rainbow on \\"Secret Garden\\", and a song that should of been given a chance on radio, \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\", vocals by Lesley Duncan, I think it might of helped the band get a bigger audience, excellent guitar by Ian Bairnson here. The bonus tracks are fine here, but it's the original album that sells it. One of the best album cover's of the 70's.
B0018O4YSQ|2.0|I finally upgraded to an HDTV and Blu Ray player, and \\"Dark City\\" was the first disc I put in to test my new system. That was an unfortunate choice, because the audio static drove me crazy trying to figure out what I had set up incorrectly. Now that I've read other reviews here (and verified that my other Blu Rays sound terrific), I realize the problem is the \\"Dark City\\" disc. While I'm obviously relieved the problem is not my new TV or player, I'm disappointed I won't have an enjoyable Blu Ray experience with this film (apparently until I upgrade from simple stereo to full surround sound). I've seen \\"Dark City\\" in the theaters and on regular DVD, so I didn't hesitate to buy it again on Blu Ray. It's a beautiful, 5-star film, but be leery of this Blu Ray audio experience.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|My first recommendation before going any further into considering this camera case would definitely be to review the dimensions Amazon provides in the product description in this page. A common concern among reviewers about this case seems to be the size. I think Amazon does a great job by providing examples of cameras and brands that will fit in it as well as its dimensions so this should not be a point of concern in regards to the product. Per Amazon \\"Internal dimensions: 2.2 x 3.50 x 0.77 inches (56mm x 19.4mm x 89mm)\\"<br /><br />This simple yet elegant leather case while basic, performs just as described. It has an open area on top so you can take out the camera's wrist strap that allows you to carry it secure in its case. If you rather not carry it like that, there is a Velcro belt loop that can be used to fit it around your belt if that suits you better.<br /><br />The snap-front-flap is designed in a similar fashion to cellular cases that use a small magnet to keep it close and tight; the magnet is not too large so it is actually pretty convenient and does not seem to damage the camera inside (as I have seen in my experience with similar cases for my cell phones)<br /><br />Keep in mind though that this is designed for small devices like pocket digital cameras, I own a Sony DSC-T7 and it fit just perfect! Just to give you another reference, I tried fitting into it a second generation Flip Mino HD and it also fit pretty well (though I intend to use the case for my DSC-T7)<br /><br />Overall, another great product from Amazon basics, the frustration free package includes additionally the 1-year guarantee Amazon offers for the product. If it fits your camera, I highly recommend this case!
0061053147|3.0|Future Noir walks the fine line between labor of love and masturbatory self-indulgence, and while it occasionally threatens to cross the line, never quite does.  It's for hardcore fans of Blade Runner who are also hardcore film geeks.  For all that, there is a lot of useful information here, but there is a complete inablity to be critical of Blade Runner the movie - or anyone associated with it, really - at all.<br /><br />The edition I read was updated for the 25th anniversary \\"Final Cut\\" DVD release with a new chapter, and also some endnotes clarifying errors in previous versions of the book.  Apparently for printing reasons these corrections and updates could not be made to the text itself, which is a pity.<br /><br />This book, for all its faults mentioned above, is certainly a complete history of Blade Runner, dating back to the writing of the source material \\"Do androids dream of electric sheep?\\" by Philip K Dick.  It follows the slow genesis of the movie, and finally gets to production and release.  I look forward to re-watching Blade Runner now I have read this, but I am not convinced that for anyone other than the most hardcore, that reading Future Noir is an optimal use of available time.

0439023513|5.0|As the final installment of a widely loved and thoroughly praised series, Mockingjay has proven to be a worthy conclusion. Not only does it meet the high expectations set by [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] and [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire]], but it's even more epic, suspenseful, heartbreaking and, ultimately, satisfying than its predecessors. In Mockingjay, the entire of Panem is the arena and Katniss finds that the true threats are more dangerous than any of the Capitol's manufactured muttations could ever be.<br /><br />Collins is great at creating fully fleshed-out characters and putting them through their paces. This is especially true of Mockingjay, where no one is exempt from making mistakes and the realities of war have led characters to surprising choices and places. Collins portrayal of the Districts' uprising is excellent. Instead of turning the tale into one of good versus evil, the lines are blurred. The loyalties, agendas and intentions of everyone are often uncertain and the heroine's goals are usually the only constant.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention the highly debated love triangle - involving Katniss's best friend, Gale Hawthorne, and pseudo-boyfriend, Peeta Mellark - which is an even larger part of the tale this time around (Collins even seems to poke fun at the issue once or twice). This is understandable given the dire circumstances that they find themselves in, the new and surprising complexities of the relationships, the repercussions that Katniss's choice will have and the much greater role that Gale plays compared to the previous books. However, this storyline is more important than any concerns about which boy Katniss is kissing next. Collins has made this particular drama about more than romance - its also about Katniss deciding who she wants to be and what she needs in life. While it takes almost the entire novel for her to reach a decision - Peeta, Gale or neither - she eventually does and, in my opinion, it's one that's in keeping with her character and the realities of her situation.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a more reflective novel than the first two. Like Catching Fire, the energy and excitement take some building up and Katniss's inner struggle dominates the novel over the action. That's not to say that this story is lacking in any way but, due to the ravages of war and the many high personal stakes, it is more bleak and focused on Katniss's inner dialog. As for the ending, it manages to be somewhat ambiguous yet nicely wrapped-up and wholly appropriate. The rest is for you to find out.ing with her character and the realities of her situation.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|I use these headphones to DJ electronic music. They can be cranked to high volume without sound distortion, and of course they sound great at normal volumes. I have no complaints about sound quality, but about the headphone's design.<br /><br />First, they fit a little snug against the head (and my head is even fairly skinny). They are, however, better than Technics' line of DJ headphones. Those really squeezed my noggin!<br /><br />Also, as several people have noted, your ears get a little sweaty after wearing these for awhile. Not a big deal, but it's a little uncomfortable. And some theorize that sweat causes the earcups to break down prematurely.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the 7506's design is that one of the foam ear cups came off less than a month after purchase. The cup can be put back on, but not without some hassle. It stays on for several days/weeks but then will come off again (seemingly at the most inconvenient time!).<br /><br />I highly recommend these headphones for their sound quality. But expect problems with the earcups. There's a chance they will either shred over time or come off entirely. No wonder replacement ear cups are so readily advertised on Amazon!
0060853972|2.0|I've never read anything by Mr. Pratchett, but this is, In my opinion, Neil Gaiman's weakest work. It's as if the authors had gotten together to write a spoof of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with angels and demons rather than  aliens, and then could not come up with anything but silly banter and nonsense to fill the pages. The characters are quaint to to the extremes of being annoying and tiresome. The plot can be summed up in ten words or less.  It's supposed to be satire, but it's really poor caricature.
0321525655|5.0|When I first read Seth Godin's review all I saw was \\"Please don't buy this book!\\" and was about to turn away before I read the rest \\"Once people start making better presentations, mine won't look so good. (But if you truly want to learn what works and how to do it right, Garr is the man to learn from.)\\" After reading the book I gave my competitors the same advice, while handing my friends a copy. This is an excellent book; that anyone who wants to get ahead in their career should read.
0439023513|5.0|Because I was such a fan of Suzanne Collins' The Underland Chronicles (also known as the Gregor the Overlander series), I picked up The Hunger Games the first week it was out and I feel privileged in a way to not only have read this series as it unfolded, but to have witnessed its climb in popularity over the last 2 years. That popularity is richly deserved.<br /><br />Collins is both a talented writer and a gifted storyteller, two things that do not always go hand in hand. In The Hunger Games trilogy, she has created characters that will stay with me and has given them a hard and difficult story that will haunt me. She also managed to keep the quality of the series high throughout which is not always the case with a book series.<br /><br />Mockingjay doesn't wrap everything up in a neat little bow and slap a happy face sticker on the bow's ribbon ends nor, IMHO, should it. Instead it provides a conclusion that suits the story, that left room for my internal `if-onlys', `what-ifs', `I-wonders' and `but-what-abouts', but that I also found satisfying.<br /><br />I consider it a great accomplishment for Collins and a true classic for both teen and adult readers. I'm very pleased to give it a permanent place on my-favorite-books-of-all-time shelf where, coincidentally, it will sit right alongside The Underland Chronicles.<br /><br />Very, very highly recommended.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|If i have to recommend just one Bruckner cycle, this would be my choice.   Those are safe and compelling performances that could fit for every taste.   As highlights i can point to great 1st, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th performances,   however i marginally would prefer his 4th and 8th for EMI and his legendary   9th from 1.966 also in DG. Anyway, all symphonies in this cycle are masterly performed. An essential.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|If anyone was to come up to me and ask, \\"What's all the stuff about Heavy Metal?\\", I would hand them the DVD of \\"Metal: A Headbanger's Journey\\" and tell them it's all they need to get started. If anyone was to come up to me and ask, \\"What's all the stuff about Rush?\\", I would hand them \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\".    Scot and Sam have done it again. Well put together, representative, respectful, awesome. The band and other interviewees seemed relaxed and willing to share their stories and experiences. Neil seemed to be having a really good time. There were parts when he was like a kid, expressive and excited to be telling his story. I think it's probably because they knew that no one involved with the movie would do anything that wouldn't be approved of, taken in a negative way or out of context. It's a true \\"Beneath, Between and Behind\\" look at things.    This is the perfect primer for any new fans and a wonderful journey down memory lane for any short, mid or long time fan of the band. Except for the early footage in the beginning there's nothing brand new to someone who's kept up with the boys but the film did fill in the shades about situations, circumstances, speculations, what have you. At whatever period you joined the Rush ranks there's a point in the film where it starts to feel like it's our story too. That's just how much this band means to their fans.    The focus really had to be on the early years since that's when the information is the sketchiest. There was no Internet and international fan clubs and Geddy has said several times how hard it is to remember all that stuff. The later years are better documented and had more direction. Overall, their entire career was well represented.    It looked as if the crew at Banger Films learned a lot from making their previous film, 666. This is a highly professional documentary that's put together well and practically flawless. I only wish there had been more musicians interviewed. Rush is such a great influenceyou would have thought people were lining up wanting to contribute. And perhaps they were, as Sam has said before it's impractical to make a 6 hour movie. Maybe there's a directors cut in the future?    Some of my favorite film makers telling the story of my favorite band, I couldn't be happier. If you thought it was impossible to hold Rush to a higher standard for how they run their careers and live their lives this film will reinforce those feelings while creating a newfound level of respect. There are many reminders of why we care so much about this band.
B001UEFTA6|5.0|I bought these sandals for my boyfriend. Our summers are spent kayaking and boating. These are perfect for what he needed: a durable sandal to keep his feet protected while also letting them breathe.  Keen sandals are well-made and definitely worth the cost.
0451450523|4.0|I've seen the movie enough times to have lines memorized. At first, it was hard for me to get into the book on its own without hearing the voices of the actors and utilizing my own imagination for the look of the land. I kept reading, though, and it eventually became its own story to me, which I like.    I was mostly impressed with the words of Peter S. Beagle. I had no idea that he was such a wonderful, lyrical writer. I actually underlined several passages that I loved, and I look forward to re-reading this again in the future, especially to my children.    However, I would like to find another copy of this book that does not have so many typos! There were several places where quotations were unclosed, or thoughts of characters were only half-italicized (or not at all), so I had to re-read several paragraphs to figure out who was speaking. There were a couple of times I saw \\"thn\\" instead of \\"the,\\" etc.    So I'll say be sure to cozy up with this book, but look for a different edition.
B00000DUE7|5.0|First, in the interest of full disclosure, I don't have this version of the recordings. I bought this music as single CDs and even at that price, it was well worth it. If you buy this complete set you have the advantage of owning it all and without breaking your wallet or purse.<br /><br />The music itself is a revelation. Most Vivaldi fans and fans of sacred vocal music know of Vivaldi's great Gloria RV589. His Magnificat RV611 has wide circulation too. The revelation comes with not only the large volume of works in the collection but the consistantly high level found throughout. There are so many beauties among these works that it is safe to grab any CD from the set and know you will stumble into something good.<br /><br />Next marvel is the high quality of performance throughout. There is no lagging or weak spots anywhere to be found. Intonation, tone quality, noiseless recording, well selected tempi, blend of all instruments and voices are all top notch. Don't just take my word for it. These works received critical acclaim when first released and there is no reason for their stars to fade with time. It would also take such a monumental effort to attempt to best these recordings that I think it is safe to say this won't be bettered for a long time, if ever.<br /><br />Finally, the soloists are great. Robert King favors a lighter and sweeter tone from his soloists and that is a good thing. I don't believe operatic showiness is the appropriate style for sacred music and I'm glad King agrees. The result is music that tickles the ear and never overwhelmes the listener. This is great music, very well performed and recorded offered at a great price. You won't be disappointed.
0393072231|4.0|I thought this was a very good book.  It was written to be able to show the thought process and research that went into believing that the sub-prime market was going to fall apart.  The only negative was that about 2/3rds of the way through i picked it up to read and thought i had mistakenly turned to the wrong page because what i was reading was almost exactly what was said in the beginning.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I was raised listening to Scorpions and to be honest I stopped listening since Acoustica. Friends told me that they did a new album, so I got it having no expectations i put it and started listening, I was happy.<br /><br />This album is the last Frontier for a band that gave us joy and meaning in their music.<br />They sold around 150 Million copies worldwide and they deserve the respect and this album gives them the closure they deserve.<br />Sting in the tail is the 17th and the last album, Starting from the first song, you will feel the heavy style has come back once again. Sly and Loreli is the ballads we all expect from Scorpions. The good die young is a duet with Tarja Turunen (Ex-Nightwish) which is performed nicely.<br /><br />5 stars for a band that could still be standing until now with such a great music.

0307592839|3.0|A Visit from the Good Squad, a collection of loosely connected short stories presented as a novel, spans decades and covers the overlapping lives of numerous characters.  Each of the thirteen chapters is told from the perspective of a different character such that no single character emerges as a protagonist.  In addition to jumping back and forth across various times and characters, Egan also experiments with form in these stories.  The most unusual story takes the form of a PowerPoint presentation.<br /><br />Egan's self-imposed constraints are conceptually interesting, and, evaluated individually, the stories are generally well-crafted and imaginative.  Overall, however, A Visit from the Goon Squad lacks narrative cohesion and doesn't exhibit enough direction or momentum to tie the stories together.  The PowerPoint chapter, for example, is visually striking but delivers a reading experience that feels more like an over-long business meeting than an engaging work of fiction.  While Egan's creativity and willingness to push boundaries is laudable, the uncoordinated result disappoints.
0439023513|2.0|Book 1 in the series was brilliant, book 2 was an incredible good twist and a very good follow up. Book 3 was torturous to read. It is slow, has very few touching points with book 1 and it develops the characters in completely different directions than the previous 2 books. It's like Collins wanted to write a high pace action script instead of a good book 3. I see the point she was trying to make, but it still remains a book that has very little to do with the complete series. Unnecessary violence, too much war, too much killing, too little character development of the main people and too much plotlines. Let's not even go for the amount of \\"coincidences\\" and \\"wow that is convenient\\" in the book... After a marathon read of 7 hours, I came away feeling empty and as if I have been waiting for nothing.
B003L77TZI|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Katy Perry and to be completely honest, I never thought she would be known for more than just being the girl that \\"kissed a girl\\". I was not impressed with her debut CD in 2008 and was a bit hesitant with her sophomore effort. Katy does not have the best voice nor is she that great of a performer, but she certainly knows a good pop hook and is good at giving us  fun tongue in cheek lyrics that get stuck in your head.<br /><br />'Teenage Dream' is a very solid effort and is a slam dunk from start to finish. I am in awe and pleasantly surprised with how many potential \\"hits\\" are included on this album. I'm glad that she stayed more within the dance/pop genre and does not over indulge with sappy ballads. The CD really only contains one ballad: \\"Not Like The Movies\\", but her voice is not really cut out for ballads. Katy has a winning formula and it far exceeds any expectations I had.<br /><br />Songs to check out:<br />\\"Peacock\\" &lt;-----an upbeat camp-fest with a beat that you will be tapping your toes to<br />\\"Circle The Drain\\" &lt;-------One of the more edgy songs on the CD speaks about an ex who had a problem with addiction. More on the rock side, but an excellent song<br />\\"E.T.\\" &lt;-----WOW, WOW, WOW! I loved this song from the moment I heard it. Very catchy and different<br />\\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" &lt;----Another catchy song that I could see as another big radio hit for her<br /><br />This CD is a must have for any fan of Katy or anyone who enjoys fun and upbeat pop music. There will definitely be a lot of hits that make their way onto radio and the charts well into 2011!<br /><br />~~~~Josh 2010

B003E48AYC|5.0|I purchased this dvd with out ever watching the movie in theatres because it just looked like a fun movie my kids would enjoy, which it absolutely was!  My son who is in middle school did enjoy it a bit more than my daughter who is in high school, but I liked it to! They did a great job with the movie (but I have to admit, I love all Tim Burton movies) and I would totally recommend watching it at the least or buying it if you have kids or just love a good Disney movie! :)
0439023513|5.0|It's the right way to end the Hunger Games Trilogy. With that said, after reading it all, I've been feeling disturbed. I guess the series was disturbing, but I could NOT get to sleep last night. I'm 18 and I had woke up every 30 minutes with Mockingjay moments lining my dreams. Alot of it has to do with a feeling of incompleteness. The ending for Katniss has basic building blocks, but there are some conflicts that are left loose. Maybe that was the intention...I guess I'll never know.  Team Peeta and Gale? You know, that decision doesn't even matter. That was one of the dynamics I loved about the series, but the story was much more powerful than a little love triangle.  Suzanne Collins kept me on my toes from the get go. I can usually figure out the ending, but as I kept reading I gave up because it was fairly impossible for me to decipher.  Don't expect a fluffy happy ending. If you do, you will be disappointed and more haunted than me. Don't expect everything to go to hell. If you do, there is no way you can enjoy the book. Just keep everything open.  Suzanne Collins ended it with a realism that other authors have failed to achieve. Make sure you've read the books preceeding this one.  This one is alot more bloody and violent. The themes are much more mature. Be ready for Suzanne Collins absolutely not holding back. I was smiling big at the end. I was also crying because it was painful.    I love the Hunger Games. Even though it made it difficult to sleep last night.
0439023513|5.0|This was a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy.  I can only compare it to \\"Ender's Game\\" - and that is extremely high praise, indeed.  When I first closed the book last night, I felt shattered, empty, and drained.  And that was the point, I think.  I'm glad I waited to review the book because I'm not sure what my review would have been.  For the first two books, I think most of us readers have all been laboring under the assumption that Katniss Everdeen would eventually choose one of the two terrific men in her life: Gale, her childhood companion or Peeta, the one who accompanied her to the Hunger Games twice.  She'd pick one of them and live happily ever after with him, surrounded by friends and family.  Somehow, along the way, Katniss would get rid of the awful President Snow and stop the evil Hunger Games.  How one teenage girl would do all that, we weren't too sure, but we all had faith and hope that she would.  \\"Mockingjay\\" relentlessly strips aside those feelings of faith and hope - much as District 13 must have done to Katniss.  Katniss realizes that she is just as much a pawn for District 13 as she ever was for the Colony and that evil can exist in places outside of the Colony.  And that's when the reader realizes that this will be a very different journey.  And that maybe the first two books were a setup for a very different ride.  That, at its heart, this wasn't a story about Katniss making her romantic decisions set against a backdrop of war.  This is a story of war.  And what it means to be a volunteer and yet still be a pawn.  We have an entirely volunteer military now that is spread entirely too thin for the tasks we ask of it.  The burden we place upon it is great.  And at the end of the day, when the personal war is over for each of them, each is left alone to pick up the pieces as best he/she can.  For some, like Peeta, it means hanging onto the back of a chair until the voices in his head stop and he's safe to be around again.  Each copes in the best way he can.  We ask - no, demand - incredible things of our men and women in arms, and then relegate them to the sidelines afterwards because we don't want to be reminded of the things they did in battle.  What do you do with people who are trained to kill when they come back home?  And what if there's no real home to come back to - if, heaven forbid, the war is fought in your own home?  We need our soldiers when we need them, but they make us uncomfortable when the fighting stops.  All of that is bigger than a love story - than Peeta or Gale.  And yet, Katniss' war does come to an end.  And she does have to pick up the pieces of her life and figure out where to go at the end.  So she does make a choice.  But compared to the tragedy of everything that comes before it, it doesn't seem \\"enough\\".  And I think that's the point.  That once you've been to hell and lost so much, your life will never be the same.  Katniss will never be the same.  For a large part of this book, we see Katniss acting in a way that we can only see as being combat-stress or PTSD-related - running and hiding in closets.  This isn't our Katniss, this isn't our warrior girl.  But this is what makes it so much more realistic, I think.  Some may see this as a failing in plot - that Katniss is suddenly acting out of character.  But as someone who has been around very strong soldiers returning home from deployments, this story, more than the other two, made Katniss come alive for me in a much more believable way.  I realize many out there will hate the epilogue and find it trite.  At first, I did too.  But in retrospect, it really was perfect.  Katniss gave her life already - back when she volunteered for Prim in \\"The Hunger Games\\".  It's just that she actually physically kept living.  The HBO miniseries, \\"Band of Brothers\\", has a quote that sums this up perfectly.  When Captain Spiers says, \\"The only hope you have is to accept the fact that you're already dead. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll be able to function as a soldier is supposed to function: without mercy, without compassion, without remorse. All war depends upon it.\\"  But how do you go from that, to living again in society?  You really don't.  So I'm not sure Katniss ever really did - live again.  She just ... kept going.  And there's not really much to celebrate in that.  Seeing someone keep going, despite being asked - no, demanded - to do unconscionably horrifying things, and then being relegated to the fringes of society, and then to keep going - to pick up the pieces and keep on going, there is something fine and admirable and infinitely sad and pure and noble about that.  But the fact is, it should never happen in the first place.  And that was the point, I think.

You can tell who will be good right off, though, because they all use Apple products. Clueless characters use generic Windows machines and the bad ones presumably are computer illiterate.<br /><br />On a pages per dollar basis, it's a good deal. On any other basis, look elsewhere.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay, the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy was an amazing book. I don't really know how to describe what happened in the book and I don't want to tell anyone ANYTHING of what happened in the book. So this review has some SPOILERS so you mauy not want to read ahead. Although the majority is just opinion.  Personally this book was very bittersweet. It was filled with such charactor development that one couldn't help but get attached to all the charactors and with every death it seemed harder to read. The charactor depth of Katniss was the most shocking of every tragic thing that seemed to happen in Mockingjay. For the first time in the whole entire trilogy you saw how much of Katniss was already dead. That she had died in the first Hunger Games book. Once she came home from that there was no longer any peice of her left, she had already died. I realized that as soon as I started to read Mockingjay, Katniss was soo shattered and fragile. No matter what she seemed to overcome or battle she still came off as a shell of her former self. She was always wanting to find herself, which I don't think she ever did.   The epilogue and the last 20 or so pages that really made be quite sad and happy at the same time. The last 20 more or so pages left me feeling really drained. The first thing that made me really sad was Prim's death, right after recovering from Finnicks I wasn't prepared for another blow. But Suzanne delt us one anyway. I thouhgt her death wasn't needed neccersarily and I had felt that so much of Katniss's previous life had been destroyed that it seemed cruel to have her little sister taken away from her after that. After Prim's death Katniss kills Coin and I was completely fine with that but after her \\"trail\\" she was sent back to District 12. Which I think is terrible! She had lost EVERYTHING and then she was sentenced back to her death ridden town. Cruel. And then to top it all off she seemed to loose everything after that. Her mother couldn't come back to the District, Gale seemed to drop off the face of the planet without a proper exit (I was Team Gale btw) and she was left to live a \\"normal life\\" in District 12 with only a few other people. Now the epilogue I thought was actually beautiful, although I was upset that she didn't choose Gale I saw why she took Peeta and the fact that they had 2 beautiful children together made me really happy. But the most heartwrenching part of the epilogue was the part where she recited Rue's Lullabye. That's when the tears started for me :( It was just a very deep and touching part of the story. At that point in gave the reader hope that maybe her children would learn of the horrors that happened upon the grounds that they played. But then, again, it wasn't really practical that Katniss is living this kind of normal life. She will never truly recover from the games, neither will Peeta, and I think that is what is soo compelling with this story. I don't think that Suzanne Collins ever really wanted her to be perfectly normal again, she wanted her to be human and humble. And having that kind of bittersweet ending is truly moving.   Overall this book is definitly worth 5 stars. If I could give it more then I would. It was a story that delved into the brutality of war and the hardships of love. And in the end couldn't be described as anything less of extrodinary.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Made in 74, this 24 hour British documentary benefits from many interviews with still young WW2 vets from various countries, including Germany. We see and hear their remembrances of such events as the bombing of London. Fairly amazing stuff from people who look to be in their 50s and 60s when filmed, probably some time in the late 60s or early 70s? I have not seen all the episodes, but you will get hooked very quickly once you see only one or two. The sweep, the tone, the clips, the interviews, the big sense of epic history, they are all present. You might even want to own this for repeated viewing if you are really into it. It's that good.
B003R9IF0S|5.0|You've stopped by and are considering the CD or MP3 download of this album, versus this Deluxe Edition. Is it worth the investment? It depends.<br /><br />The center piece is a cloth covered hardbound book of black and white pictures of The Black Keys. These are beautifully reproduced photographs, very rare today. The CD is housed in a deep cardboard cutout in the back cover, roughly a quarter inch thick. The CD, at first, appears solid black. After spinning in a CD drive for a while, the CD heats up, and the heat sensitive black color disappears. There is a 9x6 color print from Dan and Pat on tour. The preorder version was something a bit special, it also included two immediate downloads, and day of release downloads; so this gave you first kid on the block ownership of the songs.<br /><br />The Black Keys have always had unusual versions of their music. The clear and colored vinyl LP's, a free CD with a vinyl purchase, and bonus downloads. And their 'please record our concerts, but don't ever dare take a penny for your recording' policy is outstanding. They even go so far as asking for the recordings sent to them. This is an amazing band.<br /><br />I am a Black Keys fan, have enjoyed their music after hearing them interviewed on NPR over seven years ago and then hearing Set You Free on the Nissan Exterra ad during the winter Olympics. Brothers has a lot in common with their second album [[ASIN:B00008O31H Thickfreakness]], it goes back to their rock / blues roots. I even put up with the sad Catch and Release and I was not a huge fan of Dan Auerbach's solo effort. The Black Keys are back with this album. Their commercial success is outstanding; these two guys deserve the recognition. Brothers is an excellent album.<br /><br />I'm pleased that I purchased this edition, actually pre-ordered it back in March or April. The book is worth the price difference, to me. Beautifully bound, excellent printing and some great pictures of a band I enjoy.

B003V6L93C|4.0|Even though it has only been five months since the release of \\"Raymond V. Raymond,\\" Usher has done the right thing by not resting on hits like \\"OMG,\\" \\"Lil Freak\\" and \\"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home\\").\\"  Singing \\"I'll be knocking till you let me in\\" on the deluxe edition of \\"Raymond V Raymond,\\" also titled \\"Versus\\" as a separate disc (\\"Stranger\\"), Usher comes hard with a nine new songs filled with at least seven previously unreleased songs and one of his strongest singles to date (\\"There Goes My Baby\\").    Seemingly obsessed with Hot & Cold throughout the effort, as he spends much time talking about keeping his love interest warm on a cold and lonely night (\\"When you're cold, I want to be the one that keeps you warm; I'm so cold that I need a hot tottie\\"), Usher kicks off the second disc (the first disc in the deluxe edition matches that of the original release) with what you could call `The Trinity' -- three songs that will make you want to pick up the new edition or at least think about it.    \\"Love Em All\\" leads with the newly single father of two declaring \\"Ladies Get In Line, I'm gonna take you back to school\\". Credited to Esther Dean and Prettyboifresh, among others, \\"Love Em All\\" is like Usher's official press release -- \\"I'm a free to get at every girl kind of guy\\". In case you didn't understand that, Usher breaks it down on \\"Love Em All,\\" singing \\"lately I've been an oh I'm in love kind of guy, now I'm a single, beat it up kind of guy.\\"    `Hot Tottie\\" is perhaps the defining track however. Following \\"Love Em All\\" and the equally club friendly \\"I'm single and ready to party\\" lead single \\"DJ Got Us Falling In Love (Polow Da Don), \\"Hot Tottie\\" features contributions from Esther Dean and Jay-Z, the latter adding lines like \\"Big ballin' is my hobby, so much they think I'm down with the Illuminati\\" -- \\"my watch do illuminate, my pockets are Gottie but, I'm God ya'll better ask somebody\\".    Picking up where he left off on \\"Love Em All\\" Usher goes beyond \\"I'm so cold, you're the hot tottie,\\" singing \\"I'm a wild boy, you tryin' to tame me baby -- claiming you're a bad, show me baby\\" on \\"Hot Tottie.\\" One of his best singles to date, comparable to the equally daring \\"Lil Freak\\" (feat. Nicki Minaj), Usher is at his best on the chorus singing \\"I'm like ooh kimosabe, your body is my hobby, we freakin', this ain't cheating, as long as we tell nobody. Tell your girls you leaving, I'll meet you in the lobby.. I`m so cold that I need a Hot Tottie\\".    Taking a break from the club, Usher slows it down on \\"Lay You Down.\\" Produced by Rico Love, also behind \\"There Goes My Baby,\\" \\"Lay You Down\\" is not Usher's best but nonetheless is a solid effort with him utilizing his falsetto singing \\"This ain't bump and grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down\\".    The remainder of the second disc includes previously released singles \\"Somebody To Love (Remix) with Justin Bieber and the June/July 2010 hit \\"There Goes My Baby\\".  While Usher does a solid job on the last song, \\"Stranger,\\" a song produced by Drumma Boy with words like \\"Sorry you put your trust in strangers and they let you down and I'll be knocking till you let me in -- I want the title of your closest friend, I no longer want to be a stranger,\\" the other two songs \\"Lingerie\\" and \\"Get In My Car\\" can be bypassed unless you're a freak for sexy lingerie or interested in hearing a long rap from Bun B and Usher stating \\"there's too many women in here to waste all my time on you -- what you going to do?\\"    Overall, the deluxe edition is a solid effort worth a buy after the success of \\"Raymond Vs. Raymond\\" and its diverse singles, including \\"Lil Freak\\" and \\"Papers\\". Afterall, Usher seems to wrap up this successful era on  with the new songs letting it be known \\"If you not going to finish, don't start no stuff\\" (\\"Get In My Car\\").    If you must download instead of picking up the deluxe edition, the stand outs are \\"Love Em All,\\" \\"Hot Tottie,' \\"DJ Got Us Falling In Love,\\" \\"Stranger\\" and\\"Lay You Down,\\" that is if you've already downloaded or have \\"There Goes My Baby\\" on \\"Raymond V. Raymond\\".
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|I bought this specifically for my Sanyo Xacti mini camcorder and it fits perfectly. It should hold most pocket camcorders, as well as most compact digital cameras. The case has a belt loop on the back to attach to your belt. The \\"loop\\" fastens with velcro at the bottom so you don't have to actually take your belt off to put the case on.  I might actually feel more secure if the loop was sewn on both ends rather than using velcro, but I am probably in the minority as I am willing to sacrifice some convenience for a more secure fit. Most people will be perfectly happy with the case - I have not had any problems so far and I am fairly active when I am carrying the camera and case.

0439023513|5.0|Katniss Everdeen has once again just barely escaped death in the arena, but this time her rescue is due to the rebels in District 13. Katniss should be happy that she has powerful allies that are willing to fight the Capitol, but it doesn't take long for her to realize that like the Capitol, District 13 is only interested in using her and making her the face of the rebellion, the Mockingjay. Katniss is sick of being someone's pawn, but the rebellion can't be won without her participation. The only question now is whether or not Katniss is willing to risk the lives of everyone she holds dear in order to bring down the Capitol and if she can face the consequences.    Mockingjay is an explosive and emotionally turbulent conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy. Though it certainly isn't lacking in action, Collins does focus more on Katniss's emotions and her resentment at being used by everyone--the Capitol, District 13, and even those close to her. And though Katniss and her district have found refuge in 13, she and Gale (who, some readers will be happy to see, has a lot more face time in this installment) find that 13 isn't above reproach. This forces Katniss to think hard and carefully consider her course of action and its affects, and pursue the truth, no matter what. Collins exhibits some excellent character development as the war rages, testing Katniss to her limit, and revealing less admirable qualities in other characters. How each person reacts to the mounting pressure really drives home the issue of how serious, dark, and tortuous war is. Too many people die, relationships are altered, and the living are irrevocably changed.    The pace of the novel is a little slow at first, but tension quickly mounts as the rebels' plans are carefully revealed, Collins throws in a few unexpected, heartrending twists, and the answers to numerous questions, many pertaining to the Capitol and President Snow, come to light. All this builds up to a gut-wrenching and suspenseful race through the Capitol with a shocking outcome that will allow Katniss the chance to break free and make her actions entirely her own. Mockingjay might not be what readers will expect, but it is a strong and powerful reminder that violence and death aren't a game and shouldn't be treated lightly, and it reveals the physical, emotional, and psychological effects of war. Time and time again Katniss has proved herself to be a strong and admirable heroine, and though the conclusion of this trilogy may be bittersweet for both her and the reader, the final pages will leave a lasting impression on readers in the weeks to come.    Cover Comments: I really am a fan of the design of these covers! Though the blue wasn't what I was expecting given the black and orange of the previous covers, it has grown on me and I like it a lot!
0143118420|5.0|I just finished reading Eat Pray Love, I truly don't get all the negative reviews, my conclusion on those readers is that not to be mad at the author, don't be a 'player hater'. She wrote the story to share with those of us who would be interested or share some of her interests on spiritality. I myself have been a spiritual seeker for years. Because of my aggravating health issues throughout the years even though I managed to raise three children, if it wasn't for my constant seeking and Faith in my God and his Son and all that he represents, only He would know where I'd be now.  The book was both entertaining and informative because I study Eastern philosophy and other religions. I always wished that I had enough money to travel to India and study with a guru to become more enlightened, but reading this book thanks to Ms. Gilbert I don't have to travel, just about everything she wrote about being in India I occomplished in the comfort of my home. I've lerned to meditate and do yoga all by myself, my guru is all the free information and in books and videos I bought throughout the years. I can't wait to share my expirences, I think I will write a book about it some day. But those who need to travel to find themselves if that their choice so be it, like Ms. Gilbert there are many interesting stories that we can read about these people and their adventures, I don't think I could do what they did, but I applaud their strenght to do what they do.

B003YOZNBU|1.0|I like steampunk. I like Weird West. I like comic book adaptations. I like movies that bust out of the usual genre cliches.<br /><br />But it's not an unconditional love -- the loathing I have for \\"Jonah Hex\\" proves it. This movie is a bit like the evil love child of \\"Wild Wild West\\" and \\"Van Helsing,\\" with all the bloodcurdling stupidity of the former and the flashy steampunky trappings of the latter. Josh Brolin does his best to salvage this messy undercooked stew of cliches, but honestly... there's no saving this movie.<br /><br />Jonah Hex (Brolin) was a Confederate soldier who turned against his commander Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), and Turnbull got his revenge by killing Hex's family, scarring his face and leaving him for dead on a cross. Of course he doesn't die, but becomes a bounty hunter who can communicate with the dead just by touching them. All this is crammed in the first three minutes.<br /><br />Then the president recruits him to hunt down Turnbull, who is building \\"the weapon\\" that could destroy the entire United States. So he meanders off and brawls with some people, gets some crossbow-guns (what?), and rushes to rescue his favorite hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in movies?).<br /><br />I wish I could give a better summary of the plot in \\"Jonah Hex,\\" but that's kind of like examining the acting talent displayed by Megan Fox -- it's so minimal that you'll just sprain your brain if you try to actually talk about it. Jonah is traumatized, he shoots people, he gets drafted, he shoots people, he goes searching for Turnbull, he shoots people, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Basically there's not much plot here, so the writers pad it with as many fiery explosions, gunfights and hallucinatory flashbacks as they possibly can. The dialogue is leaden (\\"Ain't mah country. Git lost or git dead\\"), and all the dramatic twists are painfully predictable. As for \\"the weapon,\\" it is quite possibly the silliest superweapon I have EVER seen in a movie, short of a giant slingshot. THIS is supposed to be able to bring down a budding superpower?<br /><br />I'll give Brolin credit, he does what he can, and he slurs and grinds around his fake facial deformity with convincing grittiness. The problem is, his character's backstory is so hastily slapped together that it's hard to care -- I mean, it's sad that his family died, but we barely even SAW them and don't see much of how he felt. Megan Fox is all flat drawling and vacuous stares, but fortunately she only has a few scenes. During the more dramatic moments you can almost see smoke coming out of her ears.<br /><br />\\"Jonah Hex\\" is all wasted potential -- it has pretty much no plot, not much decent acting, and an ending worthy of \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\\" Give it a pass.ot.

B000OIZUW6|5.0|Ken Follett is an extremely talented writer. His ability to move from epic historical novels to heart pounding adventure stories is amazing. This certainly falls into the latter category and delivers on all counts. He handles multiple perspective very well, seamlessly moving between the protagonist and antagonist without a hitch.<br /><br />The story centers around Flick, a female British intelligence agent tasked with the destruction of a strategically important telephone exchange in occupied France, and proceeds in a hunter/hunted WWII spy thriller vein. Flick is countered by Dieter, a German intelligence officer intrigued by her and obsessed with capturing her alive. Interpersonal relationships abound and there is no lack of character depth. The resolution is somewhat predictable but no less satisfying for that fact. Follett keeps up the action until the very last second, blending sadness, anger, happiness and vengeance in equal parts.<br /><br />I rate it right up there with \\"Eye of the Needle\\".<br /><br />Note: May not be suitable for younger readers due to a couple of brief scenes involving sexual torture (they are Nazis, after all).

I broke this down and listened  to the first 5 songs for awhile. Then the next 5 etc.  My feeling is that this is a great recording. The band  really has a mastery over the themes and lyrics they   put in their songs. They are in a class of their own   right now. No one is even close. Buy this record and   spend quality time with it. Do not try to \\"get it\\" all  at once.   Update May 2011. Saw the band live at The Woodlands  last night and they were sensational ! I know something  now that I did not know before: Regine is a great talent.

0439023483|4.0|I'm having difficulty making up my mind as to what to think of this book. Is it completely science fiction? Is there a little bit of truth that can relate to our notion of the human being once the veil is lifted? I think I'll go for the latter. Collins has written an exceptional novel that will most certainly engage your full attention until you flip the last page. I do not intend to spoil the book by revealing the plot or any specific details but I will try to explain a few ideas I thought were very transcending. Although the book is tailored as one for young adults, the philosophical drift behind it is anything but juvenile. A first thought that comes to mind is Anthropology, the study of humanity. I would recommend anyone who has read or intends to read this book to brush up on this subject, if anything to at least look it up on Wikipedia. If one has a clear concept of the human race and his or her place on earth, I believe this book will not only entertain as an action-packed suspense thriller but also as a meaningful conception to understanding mankind and how he/she relates to the world and the other men and woman in it.

This story tells it like it was, without the political correctness of today tainting it.  I watched this and now I'm sharing it with the young adults in my family who never learned true history in school.  This is a very good DVD series!
1849381178|5.0|For an OASIS fan just like me ( with rythmn guitar experince) it is great, I guess the only song missing is \\"Record Machine\\", (but since this is an un-offical song , it is not included) Some chords are very strange , specially in the latest album but... with some oasis-chord-knowledge it is easy to find an easier position. Noel plays some songs with capo or with a different guitar tune...well, the book too. Great book, I hope Oasis will play again in the future, meanwhile let's wait for Beady Eye and the Noel solo album!
B0036EH3U2|1.0|The 1 star is NOT because I don't like BSG. No way. The 1 star is because I ordered this product while it was on sale, specially through Amazon, for $130. Quite the deal right. I don't know if it was just my particular product or what (and I would venture to say no since there's a message up on the product page right now saying it's under review and not sold by Amazon right now due to complaints) but my set is missing season 3 and instead I have a second copy of season 2. PISSED!!
0307594777|5.0|Be patient as you start to open  page one.  The story in its startup is not a big blast or stirs up the desire to quickly turn the pages in breathless anticipation.  Navigate slowly and as you turn the pages some caring should be creeping into your thoughts.  Like Hey, this story line is starting to whip up more than mild interest.  The characters are are not ordinary, nor is the story line.  I can fully understand why this novel is a page turner and a great read.  It deserves mucho stars!! Two more novels to enjoy soon!! This review is for the girl with the dragon tattoo...fully expect more favorable reading pleasures as I complete the trilogy.
